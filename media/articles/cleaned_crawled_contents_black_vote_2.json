      "text": "A brief history of the Ku Klux Klan Acts: 1870s laws to protect Black voters, ignored for decades, now being used against Trump\n\nIn the indictment against former President Donald Trump and his role in the Jan. 6 violent attack against the U.S. Capitol, special prosecutor Jack Smith charged the former president with violating four different federal laws - and Trump pleaded not guilty to each one of them on Aug. 3, 2023.\n\nThree of the charges in United States of America v. Donald J. Trump are fairly easy to understand. They require a jury to determine whether Trump tried to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 election and if he knowingly conspired to obstruct the certification of results on Jan. 6, 2021, all in an attempt to remain in the White House.\n\nBut the fourth charge against Trump - of conspiring against the rights of the voters to cast ballots and have them fairly and honestly counted - is more complicated, and it comes from a dark time in U.S. history.\n\nAs a historian who studies and writes about democracy and the American South, I believe the 1870s have something to teach us about the fourth count in the Jan. 6 case against Trump.\n\nThe indictment asserts that Trump knowingly conspired \"to injure, oppress, threaten, and intimidate one or more persons in the free exercise and enjoyment of a right and privilege secured to them by the Constitution and laws of the United States - that is, the right to vote, and to have one's vote counted.\"\n\nThat quote comes from a series of laws enacted in the 1870s called the Ku Klux Klan Acts. They are officially known as the Enforcement Acts because they empowered the federal government to enforce the Civil War amendments - the 13th , 14th and 15th amendments that freed enslaved people and guaranteed equal protection of the laws and the right to vote.\n\nAs the Brennan Center for Justice points out, in the 20th century the Supreme Court has ruled that all sorts of election infringements violate the Enforcement Acts, including stuffing ballot boxes and bribing voters. A suspect doesn't have to commit violence against Black voters to violate the law.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump with his attorneys inside the courtroom during his arraignment at the Manhattan Criminal Court on April 4, 2023.\n\nSeth Wenig/AFP via Getty Images\n\nWhen the Ku Klux Klan tried to steal the 1872 presidential election by killing and intimidating newly enfranchised Black men, federal troops swooped into South Carolina and arrested hundreds of Klansmen. The Department of Justice secured convictions in 140 cases by using the law that is being used to prosecute Trump.\n\nCongress had to expand the attorney general's staff into an entire department of government to handle the excessive case load.\n\nThe Klan prosecutions worked.\n\nThe 1872 election was relatively free and fair. In South Carolina, where the Black population outnumbered the white population, President Ulysses Grant, who had commanded the Union Army in the Civil War and led it to victory over the Confederacy, won with 75% of the vote.\n\nAfter Grant was reelected, many champions of Black rights lapsed into what historians often characterize as a moral fatigue. According to historian Eric Foner's \" Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution ,\" a \"resurgence of overt racism\" in the North triggered a \"retreat from Reconstruction.\"\n\nThe turning point was at Colfax, Louisiana.\n\nJust before Easter in 1873, federal soldiers steamed up Louisiana's Red River to investigate reports of yet another wave of white terrorism against Black citizens.\n\nAs later described by Col. T.W. DeKlyne , as the soldiers approached the town of Colfax, they saw neglected neglected crops and abandoned farmhouses. They followed a trail of corpses to the charred, smoking remains of the courthouse, whose grounds were strewn with more dead bloating in the sun. Some were burnt. Others had been shot, execution style, in the back of the head.\n\nIn his history of the Colfax massacre , journalist Charles Lane estimated that between 62 and 81 Black men were killed, most after they surrendered to the white militia.\n\nDespite the bloodshed, Louisiana officials did nothing to hold the murderers accountable.\n\nBut federal attorneys indicted 98 men. Nine stood trial, including one William Cruikshank , who Lane described as the \"burly, self-confident\" plantation owner who had supervised the executions.\n\nCruikshank was convicted not of murder but of the federal crime of conspiring to violate the civil and voting rights of Americans - the same crime that Trump is charged with.\n\nThe case was appealed to the Supreme Court, where justices heard all sorts of arguments on the authorities of state and federal governments to enforce voting rights laws. But the real issue was whether the federal government, 11 years after the end of the Civil War, still had the will to protect the civil rights of Black people.\n\nIn this illustration, Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, left, accepts the surrender of Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe Supreme Court set William Cruikshank free, and white supremacists established racist regimes in every Southern state for nearly 100 years thereafter.\n\nAccording to Nicholas Lemann, professor emeritus at Columbia University, the Civil War did not end in 1865 at Appomattox Court House - the Virginia village where Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee surrendered his forces to Union Gen. Ulysses S. Grant.\n\nThe last battle , he contends, was fought at Colfax, and the South won. The South staged unfair elections for the nearly the next 100 years. Not until the Voting Rights Act of 1965 did the federal government signal it would force states to hold free and fair elections.\n\nThe latest retreat by the Supreme Court from defending Black civil rights might have begun in 2013, in its Shelby County v. Holder ruling, in which the justices abolished a key part of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that ensured federal oversight of voting rules in areas with a history of discrimination. The 5-4 majority held that states could be trusted to guarantee citizens' voting rights.\n\nWriting in dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg compared enforcing the Civil War amendments to \"battling the Hydra,\" the multiheaded monster that sprouted new heads after one was defeated.\n\nIn North Carolina, for instance, the Republican lawmakers tried to put what is known as the \"independent state legislature theory\" into practice. That theory holds that state legislatures are the supreme authority in federal elections.\n\nBut in the Moore v. Harper case, Chief Justice John Roberts disagreed and wrote in the 6-3 majority opinion on June 27, 2023, that the \"federal court must not abandon their own duty to exercise judicial review\" over elections.\n\nGiven this long history of advance and retreat, it's not surprising, then, that special counsel Jack Smith, in his use of a law to prosecute Trump that dates back to the Reconstruction Era's laws protecting the Black vote, has reasserted the Department of Justice's power to enforce the Civil War amendments.\n\nJoseph Patrick Kelly , Professor of Literature and Director of Irish and Irish American Studies, College of Charleston\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "text": "Why Hillary Clinton Doesn't Deserve the Black Vote\n\nï»¿Hillary Clinton loves black people. And black people love Hillary-or so it seems. Black politicians have lined up in droves to endorse her, eager to prove their loyalty to the Clintons in the hopes that their faithfulness will be remembered and rewarded. Black pastors are opening their church doors, and the Clintons are making themselves comfortably at home once again, engaging effortlessly in all the usual rituals associated with \"courting the black vote,\" a pursuit that typically begins and ends with Democratic politicians making black people feel liked and taken seriously. Doing something concrete to improve the conditions under which most black people live is generally not required.\n\nï»¿ Hillary is looking to gain momentum on the campaign trail as the primaries move out of Iowa and New Hampshire and into states like South Carolina, where large pockets of black voters can be found. According to some polls, she leads Bernie Sanders by as much as 60 percent among African Americans. It seems that we-black people-are her winning card, one that Hillary is eager to play.\n\nï»¿ And it seems we're eager to get played. Again.\n\nï»¿ The love affair between black folks and the Clintons has been going on for a long time. It began back in 1992, when Bill Clinton was running for president. He threw on some shades and played the saxophone on The Arsenio Hall Show. It seems silly in retrospect, but many of us fell for that. At a time when a popular slogan was \"It's a black thing, you wouldn't understand,\" Bill Clinton seemed to get us. When Toni Morrison dubbed him our first black president, we nodded our heads. We had our boy in the White House. Or at least we thought we did.\n\nï»¿ Black voters have been remarkably loyal to the Clintons for more than 25 years. It's true that we eventually lined up behind Barack Obama in 2008, but it's a measure of the Clinton allure that Hillary led Obama among black voters until he started winning caucuses and primaries. Now Hillary is running again. This time she's facing a democratic socialist who promises a political revolution that will bring universal healthcare, a living wage, an end to rampant Wall Street greed, and the dismantling of the vast prison state-many of the same goals that Martin Luther King Jr. championed at the end of his life. Even so, black folks are sticking with the Clinton brand.\n\nï»¿ What have the Clintons done to earn such devotion? Did they take extreme political risks to defend the rights of African Americans? Did they courageously stand up to right-wing demagoguery about black communities? Did they help usher in a new era of hope and prosperity for neighborhoods devastated by deindustrialization, globalization, and the disappearance of work?\n\nNo. Quite the opposite.\n\nï»¿ When Bill Clinton ran for president in 1992, urban black communities across America were suffering from economic collapse. Hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs had vanished as factories moved overseas in search of cheaper labor, a new plantation. Globalization and deindustrialization affected workers of all colors but hit African Americans particularly hard. Unemployment rates among young black men had quadrupled as the rate of industrial employment plummeted. Crime rates spiked in inner-city communities that had been dependent on factory jobs, while hopelessness, despair, and crack addiction swept neighborhoods that had once been solidly working-class. Millions of black folks-many of whom had fled Jim Crow segregation in the South with the hope of obtaining decent work in Northern factories-were suddenly trapped in racially segregated, jobless ghettos.\n\nï»¿ On the campaign trail, Bill Clinton made the economy his top priority and argued persuasively that conservatives were using race to divide the nation and divert attention from the failed economy. In practice, however, he capitulated entirely to the right-wing backlash against the civil-rights movement and embraced former president Ronald Reagan's agenda on race, crime, welfare, and taxes-ultimately doing more harm to black communities than Reagan ever did.\n\nï»¿ We should have seen it coming. Back then, Clinton was the standard-bearer for the New Democrats, a group that firmly believed the only way to win back the millions of white voters in the South who had defected to the Republican Party was to adopt the right-wing narrative that black communities ought to be disciplined with harsh punishment rather than coddled with welfare. Reagan had won the presidency by dog-whistling to poor and working-class whites with coded racial appeals: railing against \"welfare queens\" and criminal \"predators\" and condemning \"big government.\" Clinton aimed to win them back, vowing that he would never permit any Republican to be perceived as tougher on crime than he.\n\nï»¿ Just weeks before the critical New Hampshire primary, Clinton proved his toughness by flying back to Arkansas to oversee the execution of Ricky Ray Rector, a mentally impaired black man who had so little conception of what was about to happen to him that he asked for the dessert from his last meal to be saved for him for later. After the execution, Clinton remarked, \"I can be nicked a lot, but no one can say I'm soft on crime.\"\n\nï»¿ Clinton mastered the art of sending mixed cultural messages, appealing to African Americans by belting out \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" in black churches, while at the same time signaling to poor and working-class whites that he was willing to be tougher on black communities than Republicans had been.\n\nï»¿ Clinton was praised for his no-nonsense, pragmatic approach to racial politics. He won the election and appointed a racially diverse cabinet that \"looked like America.\" He won re-election four years later, and the American economy rebounded. Democrats cheered. The Democratic Party had been saved. The Clintons won. Guess who lost?\n\nï»¿ Bill Clinton presided over the largest increase in federal and state prison inmates of any president in American history. Clinton did not declare the War on Crime or the War on Drugs-those wars were declared before Reagan was elected and long before crack hit the streets-but he escalated it beyond what many conservatives had imagined possible. He supported the 100-to-1 sentencing disparity for crack versus powder cocaine, which produced staggering racial injustice in sentencing and boosted funding for drug-law enforcement.\n\nClinton championed the idea of a federal \"three strikes\" law in his 1994 State of the Union address and, months later, signed a $30 billion crime bill that created dozens of new federal capital crimes, mandated life sentences for some three-time offenders, and authorized more than $16 billion for state prison grants and the expansion of police forces. The legislation was hailed by mainstream-media outlets as a victory for the Democrats, who \"were able to wrest the crime issue from the Republicans and make it their own.\"\n\nWhen Clinton left office in 2001, the United States had the highest rate of incarceration in the world. Human Rights Watch reported that in seven states, African Americans constituted 80 to 90 percent of all drug offenders sent to prison, even though they were no more likely than whites to use or sell illegal drugs. Prison admissions for drug offenses reached a level in 2000 for African Americans more than 26 times the level in 1983. All of the presidents since 1980 have contributed to mass incarceration, but as Equal Justice Initiative founder Bryan Stevenson recently observed, \"President Clinton's tenure was the worst.\"\n\nï»¿ Some might argue that it's unfair to judge Hillary Clinton for the policies her husband championed years ago. But Hillary wasn't picking out china while she was first lady. She bravely broke the mold and redefined that job in ways no woman ever had before. She not only campaigned for Bill; she also wielded power and significant influence once he was elected, lobbying for legislation and other measures. That record, and her statements from that era, should be scrutinized. In her support for the 1994 crime bill, for example, she used racially coded rhetoric to cast black children as animals. \"They are not just gangs of kids anymore,\" she said. \"They are often the kinds of kids that are called 'super-predators.' No conscience, no empathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first we have to bring them to heel.\"\n\nBoth Clintons now express regret over the crime bill, and Hillary says she supports criminal-justice reforms to undo some of the damage that was done by her husband's administration. But on the campaign trail, she continues to invoke the economy and country that Bill Clinton left behind as a legacy she would continue. So what exactly did the Clinton economy look like for black Americans? Taking a hard look at this recent past is about more than just a choice between two candidates. It's about whether the Democratic Party can finally reckon with what its policies have done to African-American communities, and whether it can redeem itself and rightly earn the loyalty of black voters.\n\nAn oft-repeated myth about the Clinton administration is that although it was overly tough on crime back in the 1990s, at least its policies were good for the economy and for black unemployment rates. The truth is more troubling. As unemployment rates sank to historically low levels for white Americans in the 1990s, the jobless rate among black men in their 20s who didn't have a college degree rose to its highest level ever. This increase in joblessness was propelled by the skyrocketing incarceration rate.\n\nWhy is this not common knowledge? Because government statistics like poverty and unemployment rates do not include incarcerated people. As Harvard sociologist Bruce Western explains: \"Much of the optimism about declines in racial inequality and the power of the US model of economic growth is misplaced once we account for the invisible poor, behind the walls of America's prisons and jails.\" When Clinton left office in 2001, the true jobless rate for young, non-college-educated black men (including those behind bars) was 42 percent. This figure was never reported. Instead, the media claimed that unemployment rates for African Americans had fallen to record lows, neglecting to mention that this miracle was possible only because incarceration rates were now at record highs. Young black men weren't looking for work at high rates during the Clinton era because they were now behind bars-out of sight, out of mind, and no longer counted in poverty and unemployment statistics.\n\nï»¿ To make matters worse, the federal safety net for poor families was torn to shreds by the Clinton administration in its effort to \"end welfare as we know it.\" In his 1996 State of the Union address, given during his re-election campaign, Clinton declared that \"the era of big government is over\" and immediately sought to prove it by dismantling the federal welfare system known as Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC). The welfare-reform legislation that he signed-which Hillary Clinton ardently supported then and characterized as a success as recently as 2008-replaced the federal safety net with a block grant to the states, imposed a five-year lifetime limit on welfare assistance, added work requirements, barred undocumented immigrants from licensed professions, and slashed overall public welfare funding by $54 billion (some was later restored).\n\nï»¿ Experts and pundits disagree about the true impact of welfare reform, but one thing seems clear: Extreme poverty doubled to 1.5 million in the decade and a half after the law was passed. What is extreme poverty? US households are considered to be in extreme poverty if they are surviving on cash incomes of no more than $2 per person per day in any given month. We tend to think of extreme poverty existing in Third World countries, but here in the United States, shocking numbers of people are struggling to survive on less money per month than many families spend in one evening dining out. Currently, the United States, the richest nation on the planet, has one of the highest child-poverty rates in the developed world.\n\nï»¿ Despite claims that radical changes in crime and welfare policy were driven by a desire to end big government and save taxpayer dollars, the reality is that the Clinton administration didn't reduce the amount of money devoted to the management of the urban poor; it changed what the funds would be used for. Billions of dollars were slashed from public-housing and child-welfare budgets and transferred to the mass-incarceration machine. By 1996, the penal budget was twice the amount that had been allocated to food stamps. During Clinton's tenure, funding for public housing was slashed by $17 billion (a reduction of 61 percent), while funding for corrections was boosted by $19 billion (an increase of 171 percent), according to sociologist LoÃ ̄c Wacquant \"effectively making the construction of prisons the nation's main housing program for the urban poor.\"\n\nBill Clinton championed discriminatory laws against formerly incarcerated people that have kept millions of Americans locked in a cycle of poverty and desperation. The Clinton administration eliminated Pell grants for prisoners seeking higher education to prepare for their release, supported laws denying federal financial aid to students with drug convictions, and signed legislation imposing a lifetime ban on welfare and food stamps for anyone convicted of a felony drug offense-an exceptionally harsh provision given the racially biased drug war that was raging in inner cities.\n\nï»¿ Perhaps most alarming, Clinton also made it easier for public-housing agencies to deny shelter to anyone with any sort of criminal history (even an arrest without conviction) and championed the \"one strike and you're out\" initiative, which meant that families could be evicted from public housing because one member (or a guest) had committed even a minor offense. People released from prison with no money, no job, and nowhere to go could no longer return home to their loved ones living in federally assisted housing without placing the entire family at risk of eviction. Purging \"the criminal element\" from public housing played well on the evening news, but no provisions were made for people and families as they were forced out on the street. By the end of Clinton's presidency, more than half of working-age African-American men in many large urban areas were saddled with criminal records and subject to legalized discrimination in employment, housing, access to education, and basic public benefits-relegated to a permanent second-class status eerily reminiscent of Jim Crow.\n\nï»¿ It is difficult to overstate the damage that's been done. Generations have been lost to the prison system; countless families have been torn apart or rendered homeless; and a school-to-prison pipeline has been born that shuttles young people from their decrepit, underfunded schools to brand-new high-tech prisons.\n\nï»¿ It didn't have to be like this. As a nation, we had a choice. Rather than spending billions of dollars constructing a vast new penal system, those billions could have been spent putting young people to work in inner-city communities and investing in their schools so they might have some hope of making the transition from an industrial to a service-based economy. Constructive interventions would have been good not only for African Americans trapped in ghettos, but for blue-collar workers of all colors. At the very least, Democrats could have fought to prevent the further destruction of black communities rather than ratcheting up the wars declared on them.\n\nOf course, it can be said that it's unfair to criticize the Clintons for punishing black people so harshly, given that many black people were on board with the \"get tough\" movement too. It is absolutely true that black communities back then were in a state of crisis, and that many black activists and politicians were desperate to get violent offenders off the streets. What is often missed, however, is that most of those black activists and politicians weren't asking only for toughness. They were also demanding investment in their schools, better housing, jobs programs for young people, economic-stimulus packages, drug treatment on demand, and better access to healthcare. In the end, they wound up with police and prisons. To say that this was what black people wanted is misleading at best.\n\nï»¿ To be fair, the Clintons now feel bad about how their politics and policies have worked out for black people. Bill says that he \"overshot the mark\" with his crime policies; and Hillary has put forth a plan to ban racial profiling, eliminate the sentencing disparities between crack and cocaine, and abolish private prisons, among other measures.\n\nï»¿ But what about a larger agenda that would not just reverse some of the policies adopted during the Clinton era, but would rebuild the communities decimated by them? If you listen closely here, you'll notice that Hillary Clinton is still singing the same old tune in a slightly different key. She is arguing that we ought not be seduced by Bernie's rhetoric because we must be \"pragmatic,\" \"face political realities,\" and not get tempted to believe that we can fight for economic justice and win. When politicians start telling you that it is \"unrealistic\" to support candidates who want to build a movement for greater equality, fair wages, universal healthcare, and an end to corporate control of our political system, it's probably best to leave the room.\n\nï»¿ This is not an endorsement for Bernie Sanders, who after all voted for the 1994 crime bill. I also tend to agree with Ta-Nehisi Coates that the way the Sanders campaign handled the question of reparations is one of many signs that Bernie doesn't quite get what's at stake in serious dialogues about racial justice. He was wrong to dismiss reparations as \"divisive,\" as though centuries of slavery, segregation, discrimination, ghettoization, and stigmatization aren't worthy of any specific acknowledgement or remedy.\n\nBut recognizing that Bernie, like Hillary, has blurred vision when it comes to race is not the same thing as saying their views are equally problematic. Sanders opposed the 1996 welfare-reform law. He also opposed bank deregulation and the Iraq War, both of which Hillary supported, and both of which have proved disastrous. In short, there is such a thing as a lesser evil, and Hillary is not it.\n\nï»¿ The biggest problem with Bernie, in the end, is that he's running as a Democrat-as a member of a political party that not only capitulated to right-wing demagoguery but is now owned and controlled by a relatively small number of millionaires and billionaires. Yes, Sanders has raised millions from small donors, but should he become president, he would also become part of what he has otherwise derided as \"the establishment.\" Even if Bernie's racial-justice views evolve, I hold little hope that a political revolution will occur within the Democratic Party without a sustained outside movement forcing truly transformational change. I am inclined to believe that it would be easier to build a new party than to save the Democratic Party from itself.\n\nï»¿ Of course, the idea of building a new political party terrifies most progressives, who understandably fear that it would open the door for a right-wing extremist to get elected. So we play the game of lesser evils. This game has gone on for decades. W.E.B. Du Bois, the eminent scholar and co-founder of the NAACP, shocked many when he refused to play along with this game in the 1956 election, defending his refusal to vote on the grounds that \"there is but one evil party with two names, and it will be elected despite all I do or say.\" While the true losers and winners of this game are highly predictable, the game of lesser evils makes for great entertainment and can now be viewed 24 hours a day on cable-news networks. Hillary believes that she can win this game in 2016 because this time she's got us, the black vote, in her back pocket-her lucky card.\n\nï»¿ She may be surprised to discover that the younger generation no longer wants to play her game. Or maybe not. Maybe we'll all continue to play along and pretend that we don't know how it will turn out in the end. Hopefully, one day, we'll muster the courage to join together in a revolutionary movement with people of all colors who believe that basic human rights and economic, racial, and gender justice are not unreasonable, pie-in-the-sky goals. After decades of getting played, the sleeping giant just might wake up, stretch its limbs, and tell both parties: Game over. Move aside. It's time to reshuffle this deck."

      "text": "Kayleigh McEnany brags that Trump won 8% of the black vote\n\nWhite House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany on Monday dodged a question about whether President Donald Trump agreed with Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, who over the weekend declared that \"black lives matter\" as he marched in a protest against police brutality.\n\n\"Mitt Romney can say three words outside on Pennsylvania Avenue, but I would note this: that President Trump won 8% of the black vote. Mitt Romney won 2% of the black vote,\" McEnany said, referring to Romney's performance in the 2012 presidential election without clarifying if Trump agreed that \"black lives matter.\"\n\nTrump notably quoted a Twitter user in 2015 who claimed that his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton had dodged a question about Black Lives Matter in a CNN interview.\n\nThe president, who has threatened more than once to mobilize the military against Americans protesting police violence in the wake of the death of George Floyd in custody, recently mocked Romney , the lone Republican senator who voted to convict in his impeachment trial, for publicly supporting the social justice movement.\n\nTo be clear, McEnany's claim about Romney is false. Though Trump won 8% of the black vote in 2016, Romney actually won 6% of black voters - not 2%. Romney also ran against the first black president, who at the time was an incumbent.\n\nAs for the low numbers themselves, PBS White House correspondent Yamiche Alcindor tweeted : \"At the risk of stating the obvious, both men got very little support from black voters & Republican party continues to struggle with getting support from black voters.\"\n\nMcEnany then attacked infamous recording of Romney during a 2012 campaign donor event, in which he said: \"47% of Americans will vote for [President Barack Obama] no matter what,\" because those people \"are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them.\"\n\nThe White House press secretary claimed that Trump had taken \"great offense\" to the remark. But not only did Trump agree at the time, he also said it was an issue worthy of national debate - and even implied that Romney had not gone far enough in his comments.\n\nWhen asked about the remarks in a 2012 CNN interview , Trump said: \"I don't think he should be apologizing for anything.\"\n\n\"This is something that has to be discussed. And, as you know, there are tremendous numbers of people - whether it's 47% or close to 50% - that don't pay taxes, and that don't pay income taxes and probably lots of other taxes,\" Trump added.\n\nTrump has still not released his own tax records in spite of pledging as a candidate to do so. Lawyers for the president claimed in court last month that he had \"absolute immunity\" from subpoenas .\n\nThough is is still unclear how much Trump pays in taxes , the New York Times reported in 2019 that the president paid essentially zero income tax for a decade after losing more than $1 billion between 1985 and 1994.\n\nTrump has a well-documented history of racism , though as a candidate he promised to \"take care of our African-American people.\" At one point, he even asked the voting bloc: \"What do you have to lose?\"\n\nTrump has recently targeted Black Lives Matter, threatening to deploy troops on American citizens. Tear gas and rubber bullets were unleashed on peaceful protesters so he could take a photo holding a Bible in front of a fire-damaged church .\n\nThe president bathed the White House in blue light in 2017 to honor police officers who he claimed were victim to \"unfair defamation and vilification.\""

      "text": "Seth Meyers Hilariously Lambasts Trump's Attempt to Capture the Black Vote\n\nThis past weekend, Trump made his first campaign stop in a predominantly African-American community in the hopes of ameliorating his disastrously low polling with the demographic. Despite his campaign being built on hate and racism, with an obvious appeal to white nationalists and KKK members, Trump believed he could \"overcome all that by going to a black church in Detroit, and awkwardly swaying back and forth like a dad who brought his kids to a Demi Lovato concert,\" Seth Meyers joked on Tuesday evening's \"Late Night.\"\n\n\"Also, I love how any time Trump engages in even the slightest physical activity, he has to check to make sure his hair is still there,\" Meyers observed.\n\n\"Still, it wasn't as bad as Trump supporter Ben Carson, who escorted Trump to Detroit, Carson's hometown. Because while everyone else at the church was dancing, Carson, who was standing right up front, was caught checking his phone,\" added Meyers. \"Trump is trying to capture the black vote; Carson is trying to catch Pokemon.\"\n\nBut that wasn't the last time Carson proved to be a less-than-effective surrogate for Trump. In an interview following a tour of Carson's neighborhood, the former presidential candidate was asked by CNN's Jeremy Diamond what he thought Trump took away from the trip.\n\n\"But Carson was clearly distracted,\" Meyers noted, before showing a clip of Carson looking shocked to discover he was missing something.\n\n\"Oh! My luggage!\" Carson exclaimed and ran off before even answering Diamond's question.\n\n\"That's a doctor,\" Meyers told the audience. \"Hopefully, his patients never saw that face after operating on them,\" he joked.\n\nAmong Trump's biggest problems in recuiting black voters is his persistence as a birther. After publicly doubting for years that President Obama was born in America and repeatedly questioning the legitimacy of his Hawaiian birth certificate, Trump's new position that he \"doesn't talk about it anymore,\" just isn't going to cut it.\n\nWatch:"

      "text": "Why Aren't More Black Voters Feeling the Bern?\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders continues to pack arenas and often draws standing-room-only crowds as he vies for the Democratic nomination. Though Sanders trails former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in most national polls, he is closing the gap. One poll shows Sanders leading Clinton in Iowa.\n\nPart of the magnetism drawing supporters to the senator is his populist message that includes eliminating economic inequality, challenging oligarchs on Wall Street and advocating for blue-collar workers. Without question, the insurgent nature of his candidacy is igniting excitement in the Democratic base and among many progressive voters who believe a true liberal can win the nomination, and quite possibly, the White House.\n\nThere remains one inconvenient dilemma for the Sanders camp: Most black voters have yet to \"feel the Bern.\"\n\nAccording to the latest findings from Public Policy Polling, 65 percent of black voters support Clinton while only 14 percent back Sanders. For a man who is heralded as a civil rights veteran by his legion of supporters, that number is not impressive.\n\nIn more than a dozen interviews with political strategists, leading black journalists and activists, there is a common acknowledgement that most African-American voters don't know who the senator is, and that his messaging to this critical voting base has been poorly executed. For many months, the Sanders campaign did little to make inroads with black voters, in person or online. Another problem observers point out is that there is an arrogant and insulting expectation among Sanders' white liberal supporters that black people should vote for him simply because he is not Hillary Clinton. Others point to him \"marching with Dr. King.\"  Then too, the senator has also bumbled primetime moments from which he has yet to fully recover.\n\nThat said, observers believe Sanders can gain the trust of more black voters (but likely not more than Clinton), though many question his personal resolve to do so.\n\nSanders Media Stumbles and Challenges Connecting With Black Voters\n\nSanders' Netroots Nation appearance where he was confronted by Black Lives Matter movement protesters was far from impressive. During his time on stage, activists repeatedly challenged him (they also challenged Martin O'Malley) to narrow his traditional message of economic and social justice to address police brutality. Sanders seemed befuddled and agitated; at one point, he asked Jose Antonio Vargas, the moderator, if he should leave.\n\nGlynda Carr , co-founder of Higher Heights, a national organization focused on politically empowering black women, said that was the first sign for many black people that Sanders wasn't comfortable digressing from his traditional script and dealing with an uncomfortable interaction.\n\n\"That is really what I think catapulted people's concerns,\" Carr said. \"The fact that he wasn't willing to just pivot off like, Okay, here is an action. Let me address it and move on.\"\n\nO' Malley did stumble with his \"All lives matter\" response to protesters, but he kept his appointments at the event (unlike Sanders), which, Carr says, earned the respect of many people of color.\n\nSanders' August interview with Chuck Todd, host of NBC's \"Meet The Press,\" also left questions. When Todd asked Sanders if he approved an email written by Marcus Ferrell, his African-American outreach director, in which he apologized for not meeting with Black Lives Matter activists, Sanders gave a flat response.\n\n\"No, I don't. I think we're going to be working with all groups,\" he said. \"This was sent out without my knowledge.\"\n\nLauren Victoria , a political strategist, says the senator's tone was flippant.\n\n\"He's got to understand that the Democratic Party will not win this election without black voters, period,\" she said. \"So, the Democratic nominee, whether it is Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton, or anyone else, has to acknowledge that black voters are important. So for him to go out of his way to say to Chuck Todd, 'Oh, I didn't apologize.' That means he didn't back the plan of his black staffer who made that apology. I am not understanding that level of discomfort when you are running for the Democratic nomination. Running in Vermont, I can understand that. Running nationally? I can't understand it.\"\n\nElon James White , media director of Netroots Nation, was more direct: \"So you basically threw your black dude under the bus.\"\n\nWhite, who is also media director of \"This Week In Blackness,\" one of the most important independent black media companies in America, believes Sanders doesn't seem to care how he is being perceived by black voters who have yet to warm up to him.\n\n\"I've had Sanders supporters say flat-out, 'I like Sanders. I really support him. But he is handling this really bad. I am not sure why. I hope he gets better with it,'\" he recalls Bernie supporters telling him. \"And the fact is that his platform is getting better, which is why I don't understand why he wouldn't want to nip all of this in the bud.\"\n\nWhite admits he was actually a Sanders supporter and wanted him to be the candidate who could beat Hillary Clinton. However, he says he was so turned off by what he feels is Sanders' dismissiveness and the social media attacks from his supporters that, \"I'm at the point where I don't even want to talk about him anymore.\"\n\nLuther Smith , a political strategist who worked on John Kerry's presidential campaign in 2004, has this take on Sanders' mindset toward black voters: \"Sanders attitude is, 'I don't have to be chummy with you. I am talking about the kind of things I think should be important to you and if I am saying the right things on those policy issues then you should naturally gravitate towards me.' I think that is what he is thinking. But that is not how we operate. That is not how most people operate, but that is definitely not how black people operate. We gotta feel you and we have to know that you feel us.\"\n\nIn 2012, the voter rate for African Americans was higher than white voters for the first time ever . It may also have been higher than white people in 2008 , according to some estimates. Black women were the primary reason President Barack Obama won both of his presidential campaigns. Much of Sanders' narrative challenges economic inequality, but early on his campaign he rarely, if ever, spoke exclusively to black voters about economic racism.\n\n\"How irresponsible is it for a major part of your campaign to be on economic inequality and you not weave in double-digit unemployment among African Americans and not weave in the disparities of black women,\" said L. Joy Williams , a political consultant who ran the 2013 campaign of New York City mayoral candidate William Thompson.\n\nAfter Netroots Nation, Sanders' campaign hired Symone Sanders (no relation), as its national press secretary. An African American who is a staunch supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement, Symone Sanders doesn't agree with political strategists who think her candidate's message isn't resonating with the black community.\n\n\"It's that some African Americans haven't heard it,\" Sanders said. \"On June 16 , the polls said 1 percent of African-American voters are familiar with the senator. On September 1, it was 14 percent. We know we still have a lot of work to do in terms of name recognition in African-American and Latino communities and young people as well. Our platform speaks to everyday, hard-working American people whether they are black, white, Latino or otherwise. We are talking about economic equality, but we're also talking about issues of racial justice. We're talking about voting rights, pay equity, and climate change, which by the way, disproportionately affects people of color, particularly African-American communities. So I think it is a name recognition thing, but we have to go out there and do the work.\"\n\nBut if Sanders has been fighting for the civil rights of black people for decades, how come so few of them know about him?\n\n\"Think about it: How many people do you really know in Congress that's not your own congressperson, unless they run for president?\" asked Bonita Yarboro , the District 3 coordinator in Connecticut for Bernie Sanders Connecticut , which is not authorized by the campaign. \"He's never run for president before, so it's not like there is any reason for everybody in the world to know about him.\"\n\nShe went on to laud Sanders' economic policies that she feels are very germane to black voters, as well as his anti-war stance. When I asked what Sanders' anti-war stance has to do with black people, Yarboro replied, \"Who goes to war? Think about it. Not the rich people. Poor people. Who are mostly poor? Black people. So you have to look at it that way.\" (A ccording to USA Today , \"T he share of black soldiers is still larger than the 17% of the U.S. population who are African Americans of military enlistment age and education.\")\n\nPaul Maslin , who was on Howard Dean's presidential campaign team in 2004, said Sanders and his supporters are relying too heavily on the assumption that black people will connect with his civil rights record and stance on social justice policies.\n\n\"That ain't good enough,\" Maslin said. \"This is not a library exercise, or a civics book thing. Of course, people will look at his record and they will be exposed to the record, but the thing that happens first is you get a measure of the person. Is this somebody I can identify with and identifies with me and I believe will fight on my behalf or somebody I could like? I don't think this is a negative for Bernie Sanders. I just think it is an unknown.\"\n\n\"Here is some guy who is a senator from Vermont,\" Maslin continued. \"People may think of him as a socialist. What does that mean? He's kind of an independent who shows up on my radar and takes on someone we know very well, and we kind of like her and we trust her. At least as of right now. So the burden is on him to first, from a more visceral and emotional standpoint, make some kind of connection. This is not gonna be done in an academic exercise about policy papers.\"\n\nMany believe Bernie Sanders is a victim of biased mainstream media. AlterNet published a criti que of how mainstream media outlets have either ignored his candidacy or covered him unfairly. Most political analysts and activists interviewed for this story acknowledge that the media has not done a good job of covering Sanders, but argue that he is hardly the only presidential candidate in history who has had to deal with negative and unfair press.\n\nJoy Ann Reid , a national correspondent with MSNBC who previously worked on political campaigns in Florida, said the racist media attacks President Obama endured during both of his campaigns were far worse than anything Sanders has experienced so far.\n\n\"He was dealing with attacks on his religion and citizenship,\" said Reid, whose new book , Fracture: Barack Obama, the Clintons, and the Racial Div ide delves into this very issue. \" They were not only coming from Republicans. The Obama campaign believed some of it was coming from the Clinton campaign. They believed fellow Democrats were deliberately attempting to undermine belief in Barack Obama's very citizenship and his full Americanness. He had to deal with guilt by association with Jeremiah Wright. So, he dealt with far more vicious attacks.\"\n\nYet, Obama, a black man who did not have deep pockets when he first ran, still found a way to overcome it and win two presidential elections. Yes, Sanders has had to contend with unfair media coverage. But it doesn't compare to what Obama endured. Sanders will have to figure out a way to fight back against negative press just like anyone else who wants be the leader of the free world.\n\nIs Sanders' Civil Rights Record Being Overlooked?\n\nAt least five bills have been introduced in Congress that will fight racial profiling and require police officers nationwide to wear body cameras. While Sanders supports body cameras, he has not authored or co-authored a similar bill that deals with police brutality.\n\nSanders has released a list of policies he said he would pursue if he wins the general election. When I asked his campaign to provide a list of bills the senator has authored that significantly help black people, it responded by saying Sanders reintroduced a bill to increase the minimum wage to $15 and that he worked with Rep. Jim Clyburn (D-SC) to secure $12.5 billion in the Affordable Care Act to dramatically expand access to community health centers.\n\nSanders was an original co-sponsor of the Democracy Restoration Act (DRA), which seeks to resto re votin g rights in federal elections to the 4.4 million disenfranchised Americans who have been released from prison yet are still denied the right to vote. His involvement in the Employ Young Americans Act and his legislative efforts to provide low-income heating and cooling assistance are additional policies that would benefit black people.\n\nNo one is arguing that Sanders has done nothing. The concern is that there is a belief that his campaign is operating on the assumption that its candidate doesn't have to do the work of connecting emotionally with black voters and earning their trust. Part of the problem is that Sanders has never had to depend on black voters to win elected office. Vermont is one of the whitest states in America with a black population that reached one percent in 201 1 . While Sanders was the mayor of Burlington, which has a small black community, that experience clearly was not enough to prepare him for the kind of spirited pushback he has encountered in recent months.\n\nAs helpful as his past record may have been for African Americans, much of Sanders' most impressive work has been done in the information vacuum of Congress, where people cannot see it unless they are watching C-SPAN. That is not the same as having to be a senator or representative from a state where one has to foster life-or-death relationships with black movers and shakers to win office or get reelected year after year.\n\nAnother unexpected development is that the Black Lives Matter movement is reconfiguring how presidential candidates court black votes. The playbook of white candidates simply getting a few influential black people to vouch for them and pointing to their NAACP rating won't work in the next election cycle.\n\nBlack Lives Matter Movement Redefines How Politicians Earn Black Vote\n\nThe protest movement is the factor that may well determine which Democratic candidate wins the black vote. Economic equality is certainly a priority for black Americans, but the number-one issue on most black voters' minds is police brutality - a subject that neither Sanders nor any other candidate has discussed extensively until protesters have forced their hand.\n\nClinton, O'Malley and Sanders all have to deal with black protesters as political power brokers, something that has caught them off guard. No national politician has had to deal with such a dynamic since the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Clinton's face-to-face with Black Lives Matter organizers in New Hampshire exposed her lack of reflection over the damaging mass incarceration laws her husband passed as president and she supported as First Lady. Clearly, Clinton has been put on notice, even if she were to eventually win the nomination. Another tricky dynamic in navigating the politics of this movement is that it's decentralized, challenging candidates to speak with individual protesters and far-flung constituencies whose main organ of communication is social media.\n\nDeray Mckesson , one of the movement's most well-known protesters, who is not affiliated with any organization, is finalizing plans to meet with Sanders and other presidential candidates. The fact that presidential candidates are being forced to speak with nontraditional black power brokers proves leaderless protesting can be a powerful political weapon.\n\n\"When candidates have traditionally reached out to black people, it's been through traditional organizations and people have been older,\" Mckesson said. \"So what does it mean to have 19- to 33-year-olds have considerable influence about the perception of black America? It's because of social media. The movement created that space. No longer is it enough to go to the National Action Network. It's no longer good enough to talk to traditional organizations and institutions that have traditionally leveraged black people.\"\n\nBernie Sanders' press secretary, Symone Sanders, says the senator is aware of this new political dynamic and has reached out to a wide range of black protesters. He is also setting up interviews with black media outlets and has been campaigning aggressively in South Carolina, a state that has a high black population and will be the real first test of Sanders' ability to win the nomination.\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement is challenging candidates to directly explain how they would use their presidential power to stop police violence against the black voters they claim to care about.\n\n\"The reality of most of these candidates is that they will never be able to connect with the families of Tamir Rice, Mya Hall or the communities that those folks are actually from,\" said Elle Hearns , a national strategist for the Black Lives Matter organization.\n\n\"That is what the protests and the interruptions are about,\" Hearns said. \"These folks who claim to be in solidarity with black people and black voters actually aren't, because they have no idea how to interact with folks who are experiencing pain and rage. So if you, as a presidential candidate, aren't able to engage with your constituents around the pain that they're experiencing, then you aren't fit to be a president.\"\n\nBlack Voters Warming Up To Sanders, But Barely\n\nIn June, only 1 percent of black people had a favorable view of Sanders, according to Public Policy Polling. That number increased to 6 percent in July, and now, it's at 14 percent. The uptick in favorability is a positive sign because it is still very early in the campaign season. The political strategists interviewed for this story believe Hillary Clinton doesn't necessarily have the black vote locked down.\n\nRoland Martin , managing editor and host of TV One's African-American news show, NewsOne Now, says Sanders needs to tailor his economic message and be more consistent about it if he expects to earn a decent percentage of black votes.\n\n\"It has to be a strong economic message that speaks directly to black people,\" Martin said. \"I think what happens is that white progressives want to be able to speak in these general terms and not speak specifically to black people.\"\n\nSanders says their candidate has, in fact, been fine-tuning his message to do just that.\n\n\"The senator recognizes that economic inequality and racial inequality are parallel issues that must be addressed simultaneously,\" she said. \"He has repeatedly raised the issue of high youth unemployment - particularly for young people of color. He often talks about the tragedy that, in America today, the real unemployment rate for Latino kids is 36 percent and 51 percent for African American kids. He believes it makes a lot more sense to invest in jobs and education for our kids as opposed to jails and incarceration. The senator genuinely gets it and he cares.\"\n\nHigher Heights' Glynda Carr says Sanders needs to be assertive in making connections with black women.\n\n\"Voters still want some competitiveness in the Democratic primaries and having a different voice,\" she said. \"If he harnesses that voice and actually uses it, I think he could make some inroads, just because there is that opportunity to have some contrast to the lead candidate. He is making the largest gains in the primaries than the rest of the candidates. So that is an opportunity. Don't forget in 2008 the bulk of African-American women were still with Hillary Clinton and [candidate Obama] migrated them away from her by investing in talking to them about issues that they care about.\"\n\nAs for those claiming black people don't want to vote for an old white guy, Carr has this response: \"We were a little more sophisticated in voting for Obama for reasons other than him being a black man.\"\n\nBut MSNBC's Joy Ann Reid wonders if it is even possible for Sanders to adjust his message to the grand scale required for him to win over a significant number of black votes.\n\n\"That is asking Bernie Sanders to be very inauthentic,\" she said. \"At its core, the Sanders message is that all problems and ills in the country essentially and fundamentally boil down to economic inequality, not racial inequality, and that racial inequality in other areas are a subset of economic inequality. That is his message.\"\n\n\"I don't know how he gets away from it, but he has to revise his message in a way that African Americans voters, in a much larger way, become interested in what he is doing,\" Reid said. \"Otherwise, he is just energizing the liberal white wing of the party. But that is not going to help in South Carolina or Florida. And that is not going to help him when he gets outside of New Hampshire and Iowa. That is his fundamental problem.\"\n\nBlack Supporters Believe Sanders Has a Shot\n\nJamaal Green of Portland, Oregon, says Sanders already has his vote and more potential black voters will follow him by the time the primary season begins. Green, who is originally from Washington, DC, knows most black people don't share his views. Yet that is why he credits the Black Lives Matter movement for challenging Sanders' civil rights record, something he feels is a healthy exercise for the campaign.\n\n\"He was rightly targeted by activists because, number one, he was making public statements and meeting people, whereas Clinton is really big on having private parties with major funders,\" Green, a PhD student at Portland State University, said. \"Part of why I think people are locked on Bernie is because he is the only one who has put himself out there in the Democratic field to actually be critiqued and exposed and questioned. Whereas, Clinton has been insulated thus far.\"\n\nA Washington Post-ABC News poll shows that 74 percent of black, Latino and other non-white women view Clinton favorably. That is far better than the 37 percent of white women who view her favorably, down from 48 percent in July. For now, it seems like female minority support for Clinton will hold, at least until Sanders can articulate how his vision for the country is better for them in the long run.\n\nOne black woman AlterNet spoke with is already convinced. Summer Martin , a 35-year-old African American from Dallas, says if the primaries were held tomorrow , \"I'd vote for Sanders without even thinking about it.\"\n\nWhen the senator visited her city in July , Martin says the crowd was very much on the \"whiter side,\" yet small pockets of minorities were there cheering Sanders on. For Summer Martin, Sanders' message of racial injustice resonates.\n\n\"It's clearcut and it is inclusive of us,\" she said. \"Particularly as a black woman in America. So what he needs to do now is be better with articulating that message to the country.\"\n\nEditor's Note: This story has been updated to include a quote from national press secretary Symone Sanders that was mistakenly left out."

      "text": "Breitbart Recruited This Black Bernie Sanders Supporter to Convince African Americans to Vote for Trump\n\nA reporter for Breitbart News courted a black Bernie Sanders campaigner to switch allegiances to Donald Trump in 2016 - and then convinced him to work for the right-wing website and encourage his fellow African American voters to sit out the presidential election.\n\nBloomberg News reported Tuesday that Bruce Carter, the founder of Black Men for Bernie, revealed his story to the website after falling out with his former employers when they ceased paying him in the weeks following the 2016 election. At the time, he genuinely believed Trump would rehabilitate urban communities in ways he thought the Democratic Party failed to do.\n\nAfter being recruited by Breitbart reporter Dustin Stockton, Carter told Bloomberg that the message Breitbart hired him to send was simple: \"If you can't stomach Trump, just don't vote for the other people and don't vote at all.\"\n\n\"Trump vastly outperformed the projection models in the 12 areas Bruce was targeting,\" Stockton told Bloomberg, citing areas in Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Florida. \"I never like telling people not to vote. But from a tactical and strategic position, we looked at it: If you could get them to vote for Trump, that was a plus two.\"\n\nCarter founded a group named Trump for Urban Communities that, as Bloomberg noted, \"never disclosed its spending to the Federal Election Commission-a possible violation of election law.\" Carter told the website that at the time, he was under the impression he worked for the Trump campaign and therefore would not have had to report the group's spending.\n\nWith the help of the Breitbart reporter, who has since left the company after being told his work with Carter may have been a \"conflict of interest,\" a Dallas financier named Darren Blanton became one of the group's biggest backers - and eventually moved on to work for the Trump transition.\n\nIn their investigation, Bloomberg found that other people Carter worked and met with while campaigning for Trump also worked with the presidential campaign and transition, and any potential coordination paired with the former Sanders supporter's potential \"in-kind\" work on behalf of Trump may have violated campaign finance law as well.\n\nBloomberg noted that Carter's work for the site and former Breitbart executive Steve Bannon's alleged aims when he hired Cambridge Analytica may have dovetailed in light of a former employee of the data firm telling the Senate that he utilized the company's services to suppress the black vote."

      "text": "253 bills in 43 states: How Republicans are using Trump's 'big lie' to enact a 'tidal wave of voter suppression'\n\nRepublicans across the country responded to record voter turnout by unleashing a flurry of legislation aimed at restricting ballot access, citing concerns over unfounded allegations of rampant voter fraud that they themselves stoked for months .\n\nAt least 253 bills with provisions restricting voting access have been introduced, pre-filed, or carried over in 43 states, mostly by Republicans, according to an analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School, dwarfing the number of similar bills filed at this point in 2020.\n\nMany of these measures are in response to a \"rash of baseless and racist allegations of voter fraud and election irregularities\" that former President Trump and his Republican allies promoted for months without any evidence, the Brennan Center report said.\n\n\"We are about to be hit with a tidal wave of voter suppression legislation by Republican legislatures throughout the country,\" warned Marc Elias , a prominent Democratic attorney and founder of the voting rights advocacy group Democracy Docket, who batted back many of the election lawsuits filed by Trump and his supporters. Elias said in an interview with Salon that he fears this could result in a historic \"contraction of voting rights like we have not seen in recent memory.\"\n\n\"Republicans are doing this because they think they can gain an electoral advantage from making it harder for Black, brown and young voters to participate in the process,\" he said, adding: \"This is the reaction of a party that knows it can't compete for a majority of the votes. So it is acclimating itself to minority rule through a number of tactics. Gerrymandering is one piece of it . But certainly, voter suppression is a big piece of it.\"\n\nThe proposed measures largely aim to limit mail voting access, impose stricter voter ID requirements, \"slash voter registration opportunities\" and \"enable more aggressive voter roll purges,\" the Brennan Center report said. \"These bills are an unmistakable response to the unfounded and dangerous lies about fraud that followed the 2020 election.\"\n\nThese types of restrictions also typically \"burden voter of color more,\" Eliza Sweren-Becker, who serves as counsel for the Brennan Center's Democracy Program, said in an interview with Salon.\n\n\"Because of the intersections of race and socioeconomics in this country, voters at the margins generally are going to have a harder time meeting whatever the requirements are, including if the requirement means it takes more time to vote,\" she said.\n\n\"Voters who have less economic flexibility, less job flexibility, that's going to make it harder for them to vote,\" Sweren-Becker continued. \"A bill that is going to require a particular kind of voter ID typically burdens voters of color. Voters of color tend not to have whatever the required voter ID is in higher numbers than white voters, for example. I think you can't divorce the current method of restricting voting access from the long history of voter suppression and racism in this country, where voter suppression measures were directly intended to stop Black voters in particular from being able to cast their ballots.\"\n\nGeorgia and Arizona lawmakers have been particularly aggressive, introducing 22 bills in each state to restrict voting access. Even Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican who debunked many of Trump's lies about the state's elections despite supporting certain voting restrictions, said many of the bills introduced in the state legislature are \"reactionary to a three-month disinformation campaign that could have been prevented.\"\n\nGeorgia Republicans have been particularly aggressive after Republicans lost the presidential race and both Senate races in the state for the first time in decades, although a state investigation and multiple audits have found no widespread irregularities or fraud . Georgia Senate Republicans have introduced a bill that would end no-excuse absentee voting entirely in the state and impose new ID and witness signature requirements, including one mandating that voters include a photocopy of their ID to be counted. Under the bill, only those who are required to be absent, are disabled or over 65, or observing a religious holiday can vote by mail if they meet all the other requirements.\n\nGeorgia House Republicans have introduced their own sweeping bill that would drastically reduce the state's early voting period, add a voter ID requirement for mail-in ballots, reduce the amount of time voters have to request ballots and that election officials have to mail them out, and limit the use of ballot drop boxes, as well as barring counties from adding extra early voting hours. The bill would also eliminate early voting on Sundays, which is when Black churches traditionally hold \"Souls to the Polls\" events to bring parishioners to vote after church service.\n\nThe advocacy group Common Cause Georgia called the bill \"Jim Crow with a suit and tie.\"\n\n\"We used 'Souls to the Polls' as a means particularly to get our seniors and other members of our congregations to vote, to gather for worship and following worship to go to the polls to cast our ballot,\" Georgia Episcopal Bishop Reginald Thomas Jackson said at a hearing on Monday hosted by the voting rights group Fair Fight Action, arguing that the bill \"is nothing more than another attempt to suppress the Black vote.\"\n\n\"Let's just be honest,\" he added. \"This bill is racist.\"\n\nLast year, 71,764 Georgians took advantage of early Sunday voting, according to data provided by the voter registration group The New Georgia Project, and 37% of them were Black.\n\n\"The bills as they are currently drafted are egregious in their effort to prevent free and fair access to the ballot for all Georgians, but especially people of color,\" Nicole Henderson, communications director at the New Georgia Project, said in a statement to Salon. \"If these proposed voter suppression tactics were in place in the 2020-2021 general and runoff elections, at least 2,276,863 Georgians' votes would have been affected.\"\n\nLike other Republicans, Georgia lawmakers have claimed that the measures are in response to concerns among their constituents who \"expressed a lack of faith and integrity in our current election system,\" even though the state's mail voting laws were written almost entirely by Republicans and multiple reviews found no evidence of impropriety.\n\nHenderson pointed to statements from Raffensperger and Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan rejecting baseless allegations of widespread fraud.\n\n\"From these accounts, GOP lawmakers are trying to prevent something that never happened,\" Henderson said. \"They are offering solutions where there is not a problem.\"\n\n\"The only reason why voters would have concerns about election integrity is because they were systemically and repeatedly lied to by the Republican Party and Donald Trump,\" Elias agreed. \"It is the height of hypocrisy for the Republicans to now hide behind that as an excuse having themselves lit the fire of the 'Big Lie.'\"\n\nBut the problem goes far beyond Georgia. Montana Republicans are pushing to end Election Day voter registration . Missouri Republicans are pushing a new voter ID requirement after their previous effort was struck down in court. New Hampshire Republicans are pushing to ban out-of-state college students from voting and ending same-day voter registration.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has also proposed measures that could be the \"worst voter suppression legislation\" in the country, Elias said . The longtime Trump ally is pushing measures that would ban mail-in ballots from being sent to residents who did not request one, restrict the use of drop boxes, impose tougher signature verification requirements, and restrict who can assist voters in submitting ballots.\n\nIowa Republicans have already approved a bill that would shorten voting hours, limit the state's early voting period, restrict the use of ballot drop boxes, ban officials from sending absentee ballot applications unless they are requested, and bar the counting of late-arriving ballots.\n\n\"Voter integrity is not telling an elderly person she has to jump through hoops,\" Democratic state Rep. Bruce Hunter said in response to the legislation . \"This is voter suppression. The dictionary definition of it.\"\n\nRepublican lawmakers have been laser-focused on mail-in voting after Trump and his accomplices for months sowed doubt in the integrity of voting by mail, despite a total absence of evidence suggesting it is prone to fraud, and then baselessly alleged that the election was somehow stolen without offering any proof. Nearly half of the new restrictive bills are aimed at limiting mail voting, according to the Brennan Center analysis, even though Republicans have historically supported voting by mail. Multiple bills in Pennsylvania, Arizona, North Dakota and Oklahoma are among those aiming to eliminate no-excuse absentee voting entirely. Other bills have been introduced to make it harder to obtain ballots, restrict election officials' ability to send unsolicited ballots to voters, and even bar state officials from sending absentee ballot applications without a request.\n\nElias said that he was not surprised that Republicans have launched a campaign against mail-in voting, even though they have supported it for years.\n\n\"In the Republican Party right now, the most important thing to them is to be loyal beyond comprehension to a failed one-term president,\" he said.\n\nLawmakers have also proposed legislation to restrict who can assist voters in collecting and submitting ballots and to make it harder to satisfy witness signature requirements. Legislators in Pennsylvania and Virginia have introduced bills that would ban the use of ballot drop boxes. An Arizona bill would ban absentee ballots from being submitted by mail.\n\nOther bills aim to increase poll-watcher access, impose more burdensome voter ID and signature matching requirements, and restrict the counting of late-arriving ballots.\n\n\"These legislatures saw a free, fair and secure election with record turnout that represented the will of the people, and are responding by saying 'Actually, we didn't want some of you to vote,'\" Sylvia Albert, director of voting and elections at the government watchdog group Common Cause, said in a statement to Salon. \"So there are real victims of this GOP fever dream, people who are losing access to the ballot because of the barriers that legislatures are putting in place - barriers specifically aimed at silencing Black and brown voices. Instead of embracing policies to attract more voters, Republican legislators across the country are very deliberately trying to dictate who can vote and who can't for their own political advantage.\"\n\nThe new slate of election-related legislation is not all bad. The Brennan Center found that state lawmakers have introduced 704 bills that would actually expand voting access in response to increased voter enthusiasm in the last election and challenges posed by current laws. But at least 125 of these bills were introduced in solidly blue New York and New Jersey, and in some cases these measures were paired with restrictive provisions. Outside of a rare bipartisan Kentucky bill that would create a three-day in-person early voting period while scaling the length back from its pandemic levels, Sweren-Becker expressed little optimism that expansive bills would advance in Republican strongholds.\n\n\"The politics remain such that those expansive provisions are unlikely to move forward,\" she said.\n\nElias says that he and other Democratic attorneys stand ready to fight new restrictions in court. \"If the state of Georgia or Iowa or any other place thinks that they're going to suppress voting rights and not face a fight in court over it, they're mistaken,\" he said.\n\n\"I have proven that I am not afraid to take on states that are going to disenfranchise voters. ... But beyond that, I think it's fair to say that whether it is me or someone else, states that succumb to the impulse to try to gain partisan advantage by disenfranchising minority voters and young voters, they're going to find themselves in court.\"\n\nElias said he's confident many of these restrictions would not withstand a legal challenge. \"We're not talking about the garden-variety voting restrictions that historically the two parties have disagreed over,\" he said. \"We're talking about really, really extreme measures. ... I'm not going to prejudge which provisions are acceptable and which provisions are not. But I do think that what we're seeing right now is just so far out of bounds.\"\n\nMany of these provisions, particularly in Southern states with a history of voter discrimination, would have been subject to the pre-clearance requirement under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act before it was gutted by the Supreme Court in 2013 .\n\n\"Many of them would not have been pre-cleared because they are in fact retrogressive of minority voting rights,\" Elias said.\n\nBut Elias also acknowledged that there are limits to how many of these restrictions can be defeated in court. \"Unless Republicans either have a change of heart and a change of culture around voting, or there is federal legislation that protects voting rights, eventually enough of these will stick that it will really, really change the nature of participatory democracy in our country,\" he said.\n\nThe For the People Act , also known as H.R. 1, is a sweeping pro-democracy bill that, among other measures, would automatically register voters, end partisan gerrymandering and make Election Day a federal holiday. The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act would, among other things, restore the pre-clearance requirement for states with a history of racial discrimination to get approval from the Justice Department before enacting any electoral changes.\n\nBut even an expanded Voting Rights Act might not withstand the scrutiny of an ultraconservative Supreme Court majority, wrote The Nation's Elie Mystal , and the bill as currently written lacks strong protections for mail-in voting because opposition to the voting method is so new.\n\n\"This means the act is already outmoded, and while I'm sure it will be rewritten and strengthened, it does go to show that, when it comes to voter suppression, Republicans practice the kind of racism that never sleeps,\" Mystal wrote.\n\nSome voting-rights advocates observe that the singleminded Republican focus on restricting mail-in voting could backfire. Despite a surge in mail-in voting amid the pandemic, Republican voters have historically tended to vote by mail in larger numbers than Democrats .\n\n\"Restrictions on mail voting may not have the partisan impact that some of these lawmakers advancing them would hope for them to have,\" said Sweren-Becker, adding that Republican-led restrictions are largely predicated on the debunked idea that there's a voter fraud problem in the country. \"They're using this misrepresentation as a premise to simply make it harder for all Americans to vote.\""

All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nFILE - The U.S. Supreme Court is seen, April 25, 2024, in Washington. (AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court 's conservative majority on Thursday preserved a Republican-held South Carolina congressional district, rejecting a lower-court ruling that said the district discriminated against Black voters.\n\nIn dissent, liberal justices warned that the court was insulating states from claims of unconstitutional racial gerrymandering.\n\nIn a 6-3 decision, the court held that South Carolina's Republican-controlled legislature did nothing wrong during redistricting when it strengthened Rep. Nancy Mace's hold on the coastal district by moving 30,000 Democratic-leaning Black residents of Charleston out of the district.\n\n\"I'm very disturbed about the outcome. It's as if we don't matter. But we do matter and our voices deserve to be heard,\" said Taiwan Scott, a Black voter who sued over the redistricting.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, whose administration backed Scott and the other plaintiffs at the Supreme Court, also criticized the ruling. \"The Supreme Court's decision today undermines the basic principle that voting practices should not discriminate on account of race and that is wrong,\" Biden said in a statement.\n\nMace, reacting to the decision, said, \"It reaffirms everything everyone in South Carolina already knows, which is that the line wasn't based on race.\"\n\nThe case presented the court with the tricky issue of how to distinguish race from politics. The state argued that partisan politics, not race, and a population boom in coastal areas explain the congressional map. Moving voters based on their politics is OK, the Supreme Court has held.\n\nA lower court had ordered South Carolina to redraw the district after it found that the state used race as a proxy for partisan affiliation in violation of the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution.\n\nThursday's decision won't have a direct effect on the 2024 election. The lower court had previously ordered the state to use the challenged map in the November vote, which could help Republicans as they try to hold on to their narrow majority in the House of Representatives.\n\nJustice Samuel Alito, writing for the majority, criticized lower-court judges for their \"misguided approach\" that refused to presume that lawmakers acted in good faith and gave too much credit to the challengers.\n\nAlito wrote that one weakness of the Black voters' case was that they did not produce an alternative map, which he called an \"implicit concession\" that they couldn't have drawn one. \"The District Court's conclusions are clearly erroneous because it did not follow this basic logic,\" he wrote.\n\nJustice Elena Kagan, writing for the three liberals, said her conservative colleagues ignored the work of the lower court that found the district had been gerrymandered by race.\n\n\"Perhaps most dispiriting,\" Kagan wrote, the court adopted \"special rules to specially disadvantage suits to remedy race-based redistricting.\"\n\nRichard Hasen, an election expert at the University of California at Los Angeles law school, agreed with Kagan, writing in a blog post that the decision \"makes it easier for Republican states to engage in redistricting to help white Republicans maximize their political power.\"\n\nJanai Nelson, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said in a statement, \"The highest court in our land greenlit racial discrimination in South Carolina's redistricting process, denied Black voters the right to be free from the race-based sorting and sent a message that facts, process, and precedent will not protect the Black vote.\"\n\nHowever, Sen. Thomas Alexander, the president of the South Carolina Senate, praised the ruling. \"As I have said throughout this process, our plan was meticulously crafted to comply with statutory and constitutional requirements, and I was completely confident we would prevail,\" Alexander said.\n\nThe Supreme Court in 2019 ruled that partisan gerrymandering cases could be not be brought in federal courts. Justice Clarence Thomas, who was part of the conservative majority five years ago, wrote separately Thursday to say federal courts should similarly get out of the business of refereeing racial gerrymandering disputes.\n\n\"It is well past time for the Court to return these political issues where they belong-the political branches,\" Thomas wrote. No other justice signed on.\n\nWhen Mace first won election in 2020, she edged Democratic incumbent Rep. Joe Cunningham by 1%, under 5,400 votes. In 2022, following redistricting driven by the 2020 census results, Mace won reelection by 14%. She is among eight Republicans who voted in October to oust Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., as House speaker.\n\nThe case differed from one in Alabama in which the court ruled last year that Republican lawmakers diluted Black voters' political power under the landmark Voting Rights Act by drawing just one district with a majority Black population. The court's decision led to new maps in Alabama and Louisiana with a second district where Democratic-leaning Black voters comprise a substantial portion of the electorate.\n\nIn South Carolina, Black voters wouldn't have been as numerous in a redrawn district. But combined with a substantial set of Democratic-leaning white voters, Democrats might have been competitive in the reconfigured district.\n\nThe high court left open one part of the case about whether the map intentionally sought to dilute the votes of Black residents.\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court at https://apnews.com/hub/us-supreme-court .\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Ayanna Alexander and Farnoush Amiri contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Solis)\n\nJACKSON, Miss. (AP) - A few years ago, Tiffany Wilburn just didn't see the point in voting any longer.\n\nHer children didn't have proper school books, health insurance was expensive and hard to get, police abuse continued against Black residents, and her city's struggle to get clean drinking water seemed emblematic of her community always coming out on the short end of state decision-making.\n\nCombine that with Mississippi's long history of voter suppression and she felt casting a ballot was simply a hopeless exercise.\n\n\"It's like you're not being heard,\" Wilburn said in her hometown of Jackson, the state capital. \"You run to the polls, hoping and praying for change, and then you look around and nothing's really happening. So you shut down.\"\n\nRecent interviews with Black voters, voting rights groups, candidates and researchers show that the voter fatigue felt by Wilburn has been widely shared in a state where nearly 40% of the overall population is Black. This year, political dynamics have combined to begin changing that, leading many voters such as Wilburn to reengage.\n\nThe race for governor appears competitive and is drawing national attention. Tuesday's election also happens to be the first one in Mississippi to be held without the burden of an unusual post-Reconstruction constitutional provision that had made it virtually impossible for Black candidates to win on a statewide basis.\n\nFive Black candidates are running for statewide office, from agriculture commissioner to secretary of state. Each is trying to become the first Black candidate to ever win one of those posts.\n\nMonitors review a card with a submitted question from an attendee during a candidates forum, Oct. 26, 2023, in Vicksburg, Miss. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)\n\nVoting rights advocates hope the changes will encourage a rebuilding of the Black community's voting base and provide a tail wind to Democrats in a state that is now mostly controlled by Republicans.\n\n\"Black people here aren't scared to vote and do care because it impacts all of us, our entire livelihood,\" said Glennard Warren, a 66-year-old voter in Vicksburg. \"Now it's more important that we enhance and educate all voters, especially Black people. But the voting process isn't necessarily sound and there are many constraints that we're facing like gerrymandering, purging of voter rolls - it's a lot. But I'm going and taking everyone I can with me.\"\n\nWhite leaders of both parties used numerous tactics over several decades to suppress the Black vote, from poll taxes to literacy tests. Among the most pernicious was a provision slipped into the Mississippi Constitution in 1890 that required candidates for governor and other statewide offices to win not only a majority of the vote, but also a majority of the state's 122 House districts.\n\nAfter a lawsuit, voters in 2020 repealed it , ensuring that candidates just had to win a simple statewide majority. Some voting rights groups and candidates said that provides an opening, not just for this year's candidates, but also to start expanding their voter base.\n\nAn attendee to a candidates forum reviews the event program that list those people seeking a statewide office in the November 7 election, in addition to a reminder of the general election and the general runoff of Nov. 28, in Vicksburg, Miss., on Oct. 26, 2023. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)\n\nRobert Bradford, the Democratic nominee for state agriculture commissioner, said repealing that part of the constitution will open doors for Black candidates to succeed in the years to come. He joined with several other Democratic candidates to engage with voters who had become disenchanted, thinking their voice would never make a difference in the state.\n\n\"We've got to sow those seeds in areas that never had anything grown,\" he said. \"We met people who felt like, 'Why vote because nothing's going to happen?' It's that mindset and those feelings that we have to address.\"\n\nBlack voters in the state still face a disproportionate burden. A common complaint is about a purging of voter rolls that has caused problems for Black voters as recently as this year's August primary.\n\nTaylor Turnage of the Mississippi Votes Action Fund had to file a provisional ballot after she went to her polling place and found her name had been removed from the rolls.\n\n\"I've been voting in Tougaloo for several years with no problems. But when I went, I was told, 'You're not in the system,'\" she said. \"You're purging people who are actually voting now? If people don't know they're purged until Election Day, it's too late then.\"\n\nU.S. Air Force veteran and retired postal worker, James Robinson, 90, left, speaks with other attendees at a candidates forum, Oct. 26, 2023, in Vicksburg, Miss. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)\n\nAmong the remaining hurdles is another part of the state constitution that strips voting rights from people who have committed certain felonies, a provision that also dates to 1890.\n\nCritics say the named crimes were ones the white power structure thought Black people were more likely to commit. In 2009, a former Democratic state attorney general issued an opinion that expanded the list to 22 crimes, including timber larceny, carjacking, felony shoplifting and passing bad checks.\n\n\"We have to have conversations about what's still on the books -- because that repeal is done, but the work isn't over,\" said Danyelle Holmes, a national social justice organizer for Repairers of the Breach, a group that advocates for voting rights, democracy and a range of social issues. \"That's how we get to the root of the fatigue.\"\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court declined to reconsider a 2022 decision by the conservative 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that said Mississippi had remedied the discriminatory intent of the original provisions by altering the list of disenfranchising crimes.\n\nMany other states in recent years have taken steps to reinstate voting rights for former felons. In Mississippi, more than 10% of Black adults are formerly incarcerated, according to a 2022 report by The Sentencing Project.\n\nRonald Graham-Wilson, 21, expresses his uncertainty in who he plans to vote for in the upcoming statewide elections this year and federal elections in 2024, during a roundtable discussion with other youth community activists, on elections, race and voter fatigue, Oct. 25, 2023, in Jackson, Miss. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)\n\n\"That's a huge percentage. If the elections were close and that 10% could vote, it very well could sway the elections,\" said Marvin King, a professor at the University of Mississippi who focuses on African American politics.\n\nMore recent events have contributed to a sense of embattlement in the Black community.\n\nIn particular, a 2022 water crisis in Jackson left most of the 150,000 residents in the majority Black city without running water for several days after heavy rains damaged one of the water-treatment plants. Residents lamented the government's lack of attention to their basic needs.\n\nLast spring, Republican Gov. Tate Reeves, who faces a reelection challenge from Democrat Brandon Presley, signed into law a major change passed by the Republican-controlled and majority white Legislature that created special courts with appointed judges in the county that includes Jackson.\n\nTwo lawsuits challenged it, arguing that the Mississippi Constitution requires most judges to be elected. Critics also said it was another way to make it harder for Black voters to elect candidates of their choice. In September, the Mississippi Supreme Court blocked the appointment of the circuit court judges but allowed a new lower-level court with one appointed judge.\n\nTy Pinkins, the Democratic nominee for secretary of state, took notice, citing his extensive history in suing the state for similar offenses in the past.\n\n\"We're here to make sure that doesn't continue to happen,\" he said during a candidates' rally in Vicksburg.\n\nBlack voters are listening, but some said boosting engagement is a two-way street: If they show up to vote, it has to be translated into action. That sentiment is especially strong on college campuses, a focal point of several of the Black candidates running for statewide office.\n\nStudents at Jackson State University, a historically Black college, want to see candidates spend time on campus discussing the priorities of the youngest voting generation.\n\n\"If I were to put myself in a candidate's shoes, I would actually go on campus not to get votes but to understand,\" said Austin Crudup, a 23-year-old student. \"Ask what is something that you would like me to fix or change? What could I do to make your life a little bit easier?\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Jackson, Mississippi, and Gary Fields in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press coverage of race and voting receives support from the Jonathan Logan Family Foundation.

(AP Photo/Noreen Nasir)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - A few dozen New Yorkers boarded a bus in Harlem on Friday with civil rights leader the Rev. Al Sharpton and members of the group formerly known as the Central Park Five , bound for Philadelphia, where they toured the city hoping to energize the youth vote ahead of the 2024 election.\n\nWith less than 40 days until Election Day, the choice of a battleground state for a get-out-the-vote bus tour made sense: whichever presidential candidate wins Pennsylvania is likely to do so by a slim margin and with a lion's share of the Black vote. But it was a strategic choice to recruit speakers who many first knew as Black and Latino teenagers wrongly convicted in a case that former President Donald Trump supported so vociferously, Sharpton said.\n\n\"There are polls saying that some Black men are moving toward Trump,\" he told The Associated Press on Friday. \"I don't know if that's true or not. But Black men need to hear some Black men saying, 'Let me tell you about the Trump I know.'\"\n\nThe Trump that the Central Park Five knows is the one who took out a newspaper ad in New York City, in the aftermath of the 1989 attack on a white female jogger, calling for the teenagers' execution. The case roiled racial tensions locally and later became a national symbol of racism in the judicial system.\n\nAnd more than 34 years later, the group of men, now known as the Exonerated Five, see the former president as a convicted felon who passed through the same courthouse hallways when he was found guilty in a hush money trial in June.\n\nYusef Salaam, one of the exonerated men, said Friday that using his voice to encourage voter participation lines up with lessons his mother taught him as a teenager. His message to voters in Philadelphia was part condemnation of Trump and part championing doing one's civic duty.\n\n\"We have to fight like the lives of our children's, children's children depend on it,\" said Salaam, who won a seat on the New York City Council last year. \"Will we be allowed to somehow appreciate the American dream, or will we be plunged further into the American nightmare?\"\n\nThe jogger case was Trump's first foray into tough-on-crime politics that preluded his full-throated populist political persona. Since then, dog whistles as well as overtly racist rhetoric have been fixtures of Trump's public life.\n\nBut the Republican presidential nominee has been supportive of reforms that speak to flaws in the criminal legal system. As president, Trump signed a law eliminating harsh sentences for non-violent drug crimes that had filled the nation's prisons and exacerbated racial disparities in incarceration. In 2018, he used his power to commute the sentences of people like Alice Marie Johnson, who served 21 years in federal prison on a drug trafficking conviction.\n\nSalaam and the other wrongly convicted young men had their convictions vacated in 2002 after evidence linked another person to the brutal beating and rape of the Central Park jogger. Trump in 2019 refused to apologize to the exonerated men, and again defended his position on the case during a debate with Vice President Kamala Harris earlier this month.\n\nOf the Exonerated Five - which includes Salaam, Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Raymond Santana and Korey Wise - just Salaam and Wise boarded the bus to Philadelphia. With Sharpton and more than 50 supporters, Salaam and Wise engaged residents and students at Sharon Baptist Church, the University of Pennsylvania and the Community College of Philadelphia.\n\nWise said the message he was bringing to Philadelphians was simple: \"Get out the vote, while we're still here and while we're still alive.\"\n\nOf the Exonerated Five, Wise spent the most time in prison before his conviction was overturned. He wants people to vote as a way of preventing any other young person from experiencing what h did.\n\n\"I'm not doing this for me, I'm doing this for little Korey who's not here no more,\" he said. \"I'm representing him.\"\n\nThe bus tour was sponsored by Sharpton's National Action Network, a nonprofit civil rights group that does not endorse political candidates. But Sharpton and the exonerated men have been outspoken this election year, calling out Trump's rhetoric around the Central Park jogger case, as well as his record on matters involving race.\n\nIn August, during the final night of Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Sharpton shared the stage with members of the Exonerated Five. From the stage, Salaam called out Trump's failure to apologize for his harmful rhetoric in the Central Park jogger case.\n\nWeeks later, during the debate, Harris evoked the exonerated men in her own critique of Trump's decades-long history of stoking racial division. In the spin room after the debate, as Trump walked through speaking to journalists, Salaam flagged down the former president and confronted him.\n\nTrump mistook him for a supporter, a moment that Salaam found bizarre. But he still walked away feeling proud, the councilman said.\n\n\"These moments of standing for yourself, of speaking for yourself, also speaks life into others,\" Salaam told AP. \"It gives others the opportunity to see, if he could stand up, I could stand up. If he could still be here, I could be here.\"\n\nSharpton said Philadelphia was the first of other planned legs of his organization's voter engagement tour. In the coming weeks, he said he would make appearances in the battleground states of Ohio, Wisconsin and North Carolina.\n\nThe effort's success will be judged not just by the outcome of the election, but by the community's turnout on Nov. 5, said Malcolm Byrd, National Action Network's chief operating officer.\n\n\"This is not just a mobilization effort, just for us to go to say we did something,\" he said. \"We want to plant a fire in Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia. ... We're going with a spark, with the hope that by Election Day it'll be an inferno of justice.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - President Joe Biden virtually addressed the Rev. Al Sharpton's racial justice conference on Friday, telling a sympathetic crowd \"we've kept our promises\" as he ramps up efforts to energize Black voters who will be vital to his reelection bid this fall.\n\nAddressing several hundred attendees at the annual National Action Network Convention in New York, Biden ticked through a long list of what he said were some of his administration's key accomplishments for Black Americans. He detailed providing federal public works funding to reconnect city neighborhoods that were divided decades ago when highways were built , and also investing billions in historically Black colleges and universities.\n\n\"Together, we've kept our promises to make some of the most significant investments in the Black American community ever,\" Biden said. He also noted his pardoning thousands of inmates convicted on federal marijuana charges , combating racial discrimination in the real estate market and canceling student debts for millions of Americans.\n\nHe called that \"transformational change\" but said, \"We know there's much more work to do.\" He said he still hoped to sign major legislation expanding voting rights and the George Floyd Act , a police reform package named for a Black man whose murder by Minneapolis police in 2020 sparked widespread racial justice protests and calls for federal legislation.\n\nBiden is facing a November rematch with Republican former President Donald Trump , who has tried to step up his own a ppeal to Black voters .\n\nTrump has suggested that his four criminal indictments have boosted his standing with members of the key voting bloc because they see him as a victim of discrimination - comparing his legal jeopardy to the historic legacy of anti-Black prejudice in the U.S. legal system. The former president has also repeatedly compared himself to anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela , arguing that federal and state prosecutors have targeted him and his businesses for political reasons.\n\nAlthough Biden historically enjoys high support and approval from Black Democrats, 45% of Black Americans said they disapprove of the way Biden is handling his job as president in March, according to polling by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research . Just over half said they approve.\n\nBiden didn't mention Trump by name in his speech Friday, but referred to opposition by top Republicans to abortion rights and expanded access to the ballot box in stressing, \"There are real threats we face.\"\n\n\"There are more extreme voices out there who simply don't want to see people of color in the future of our country,\" the president said.\n\nTerrence Floyd, George Floyd's brother, said it meant a lot to hear Biden pledge to keep pursuing reforms in his sibling's name.\n\n\"For him to still be adamant on passing that bill, I appreciate it,\" he said. \"He's got the Floyd family behind him.\"\n\nThe act passed the then-Democrat-controlled House in 2021, but stalled in a Senate where Republicans held a majority.\n\nOthers in the crowd were equally enthusiastic. About half the audience stood and applauded as the president approached the podium at a White House auditorium that was seen on a livestream.\n\nBiden's virtual speech capped a week of appearances from administration officials and other prominent local and national leaders. Vice President Kamala Harris addressed the convention in person last year.\n\nElaine Duval, of New York City, said she found the president to be genuine in his appeals to Black voters and that she doesn't \"think that he has gotten the praise and merit that he deserves.\" But she also suggested that Biden missed an opportunity to address the suffering of Palestinians amid Israel's war with Hamas in the Gaza strip.\n\n\"Oppression of any people anywhere is oppression of humanity,\" Duval said. \"And Black people, the Black race, we have been used to oppression and subjugation. I wish he had mentioned that because they are our kinfolk. He should bring the power of the presidency to bear upon that.\"\n\nAs he travels the country campaigning for reelection, Biden has frequently faced protesters decrying his administration's handling of the war in Gaza.\n\nSharpton, who has regularly convened a small group of civil rights leaders at the White House on issues affecting Black Americans, introduced Biden by recounting his years of engagement with the National Action Network.\n\n\"I give that background so people won't think he's just doing his viral speech to get votes,\" Sharpton said.\n\nHe also took a swipe at Trump, saying, \"There are those that want our voters, that want to take us for granted and show us some gold sneakers and other foolishness.\"\n\n\"We want to know about concrete things,\" Sharpton said.\n\nFranklin Malone, a member of NAN's Washington chapter, said he would have liked to hear Biden speak more about addressing incarceration rates in the Black community, beyond marijuana offenders.\n\n\"We can press for what we need. But at least he's on the right track,\" Malone said. \"Sometimes a half a chicken is better than no chicken at all.\"\n\nMalone said Biden didn't sound like a politician taking the Black vote for granted, as Trump has suggested top Democrats do.\n\n\"The president is in a position to empower us to empower him,\" Malone said. \"He needs our vote. We need him.\"\n\n__ Weissert reported from Washington.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nDonald Trump falsely questioned Kamala Harris' race during an appearance with the National Association of Black Journalists in Chicago that quickly turned hostile.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump pumps his fists after speaking at a campaign rally, Wednesday, July 31, 2024, in Harrisburg, Pa. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - Donald Trump has found tremendous success from the very first moment he stepped onto the presidential stage by stoking racial animus.\n\nDemocrats expressed new outrage this week at the former president's derisive and false charge that Vice President Kamala Harris , who is of Jamaican and Indian heritage, only recently \"turned Black\" for political gain. Some Republicans - even from within Trump's own campaign - seemed to distance themselves from the comment.\n\nBut Trump's rhetoric this week, and his record on race since he entered politics nearly a decade ago, indicate that divisive attacks on race may emerge as a core GOP argument in the three-month sprint to Election Day - whether his allies want them to or not.\n\nA Trump adviser, granted anonymity Thursday to discuss internal strategy, said the campaign doesn't need to focus on \"identity politics\" because the case against Harris is that she is \"so liberal it's dangerous.\" The adviser pointed to Harris' record on the Southern border, crime, the economy and foreign policy.\n\nIn a sign that Trump may not be coordinating his message with his own team, the Republican presidential nominee doubled down on the same day with a new attack on Harris' racial identity. He posted on his social media site a picture of Harris donning traditional Indian attire in a family photo.\n\nSen. Cynthia Lummis, a Wyoming Republican who has endorsed Trump, was among a number of lawmakers on Capitol Hill who said Thursday that the rhetoric around race and identity is not \"helpful to anyone\" this election cycle.\n\n\"People's skin color doesn't matter one iota,\" Lummis said in an interview.\n\nIt's been less than two weeks after President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid and endorsed Harris . Trump has had to pivot from campaigning against an 81-year-old white man showing signs of decline to facing a 59-year-old Black woman who is drawing much larger crowds and new enthusiasm from Democratic donors .\n\nTrump went to the National Association of Black Journalists convention on Wednesday. In an appearance carried live on cable news and shared widely online, he falsely suggested Harris misled voters about her race .\n\n\"I didn't know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black and now she wants to be known as Black. So, I don't know, is she Indian or is she Black?\" Trump said Wednesday.\n\nAt a Pennsylvania rally hours later, Trump's team displayed years-old news headlines describing Harris as the \"first Indian-American senator\" on the big screen in the arena. And Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Trump's running mate, told reporters traveling with him that Harris was a \"chameleon\" who changed her identity when convenient.\n\nHarris attended Howard University, the historically Black institution where she pledged the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority, and has often talked throughout her career about being both about being Black and Indian American.\n\nTrump's team argued that his message on race is part of a broader pitch that may appeal to some Black voters, although very few allies defended his specific rhetoric this week.\n\n\"What impacts our historic gains with Black voters is President Trump's record when compared to Kamala's,\" said Trump campaign senior adviser Lynne Patton, pointing to the \"cost of living, securing the border, deporting Kamala's illegal aliens, making neighborhoods safe again and keeping men out of women's sports.\"\n\nVeteran Republican pollster Frank Luntz said he explored racial politics during a Wednesday focus group with swing voters almost immediately after Trump's interview. He found that Harris may be vulnerable to criticism based on her gender, but race-based attacks could hurt Trump among the voters that matter most this fall.\n\nMuch has changed, Luntz said, since Trump rose to prominence by questioning the citizenship of Barack Obama, the nation's first Black president.\n\n\"Trump seems to think that he can criticize her for how she's dealt with her race. Well, no one's listening to that criticism. It simply doesn't matter,\" Luntz said. \"If it's racially driven, it will backfire.\"\n\nEugene Craig, the former vice chair of the Maryland Republican Party, said that Trump \"got what he wanted\" at the NABJ convention but that the substance of his argument risked being more offensive than appealing.\n\n\"The one thing that Black folks will never tolerate is disrespecting Blackness, and that goes for Black Republicans too,\" said Craig, who is Black and worked as a staffer for conservative pundit Dan Bongino's 2012 Senate campaign. He is now supporting Harris.\n\nTrump has frequently used race to go after his opponents since he stepped into presidential politics nearly a decade ago.\n\nTrump was perhaps the most famous member of the so-called \"birther\" movement questioning where Obama was born. He kicked off his first campaign by casting Mexican immigrants as \"rapists\" and drug traffickers and later questioned whether a U.S. federal judge of Mexican heritage could be fair to him .\n\nWhile in the White House, Trump defended a white supremacist march in Charlottesville, Virginia, and suggested that the U.S. stop accepting immigrants from \"shithole\" countries including Haiti and parts of Africa. In August 2020, he suggested Harris, who was born in California, might not meet the Constitution's eligibility requirements to be vice president.\n\nAnd just two weeks after formally entering the 2024 campaign, he dined with notorious white supremacist Nick Fuentes at his Mar-a-Lago residence.\n\nTrump won in 2016 but lost reelection in 2020 to Biden by close margins in several swing states. He swept the 2024 Republican primary even while facing a raft of criminal charges.\n\nSome Trump critics worried that his racial strategy might resonate with a significant portion of the electorate anyway. Voters will decide in November whether to send a Black woman to the Oval Office for the first time in the nation's nearly 250-year history.\n\n\"I hope Trump's attacks on Harris are just him flailing about ineffectively. But put together Trump's shamelessness, his willingness to lie, his demagogic talent, and the issue of race - and a certain amount of liberal complacency that Trump is just foolish - and I'm concerned,\" Bill Kristol, a leading conservative anti-Trump voice, posted on social media Thursday.\n\nA Harris adviser described the moment as an opportunity to remind voters of the chaos and division that Trump breeds. But the adviser, granted anonymity to discuss internal strategy, said it would be a mistake for Democrats to engage with Trump's attacks on race at the expense of the campaign's broader focus on key policies.\n\nSo long as the campaign does not get distracted, the adviser said, Harris' team believes there is little political upside for Trump to continue attacking Harris' racial identity.\n\nHarris told a gathering of a historically Black sorority on Wednesday that Trump's attack was \"the same old show: the divisiveness and the disrespect.\"\n\nOn the ground in at least one swing state, however, there were signs that Trump's approach may be resonating - at least among the former president's white male base.\n\nJim Abel, a 65-year-old retiree who attended a rally for Vance in Arizona on Wednesday, said he agreed with Trump's focus on Harris' racial identity.\n\n\"She's not Black,\" Abel said. \"I've seen her parents. I've pictures of her and her family and she's not Black. She's looking for the Black vote.\"\n\nBut several high-profile Republican voices disagreed.\n\nConservative commentator Ben Shapiro posted on X a picture of a road sign with two directions. One led to, \"Attack Kamala's record, lies and radicalism,\" while the other, \"Is she really Black?\"\n\n\"I dunno guys, I just think that maybe winning the 2024 election might be more important than having this silly and meaningless conversation,\" Shapiro wrote.\n\n___\n\nBrown reported from Chicago.

(AP Photo/Mike Caudill, File)\n\nSUFFOLK, Va. (AP) - In the closing days of her campaign, Rep. Elaine Luria stood on a wooden porch in a far-flung part of her newly drawn district, microphone in hand and a 7-year-old Black girl at her side, to make her final case for what is at stake in the midterm elections .\n\nThe Virginia Democrat, quoting the late Rep. Elijah Cummings , pointed toward the girl and said: \"Our children are a window into the future that we will never see.\" That future, Luria argued, will look much bleaker if her Republican challenger wins one of the most contested House races in the country.\n\nIn her first two congressional races, Luria, a former Navy commander, would more likely have been seen in settings with a military backdrop or theme. But this time she is in Suffolk, a new part of her district and one that has a Black population of 40% whose votes could well determine if she gets a third term.\n\n\"If Luria is going to have a chance at winning, she absolutely needs to win over Black voters,\" said Rebecca Bromley-Trujillo, research director at the Wason Center at Christopher Newport University. \"Even in our polling, we see that Black voters are more likely to say they're undecided than white voters, and that suggests that there's some vulnerability there for Luria and a need to reach out.\"\n\nLuria has gained a higher profile over the past year because of her seat on the House committee investigating the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. But there is scant evidence it has helped her politically, and it may have even cut into her support.\n\nStill, she also frames this race as a referendum on democracy itself. It is a country-over-party appeal that will be tested in a district that has among the nation's highest concentrations of families with military connections.\n\n\"This is about a lot more than just Virginia's 2nd Congressional District. It's certainly about a lot more than getting Elaine Luria reelected,\" she said to a predominantly Black crowd of constituents on Sunday. \"It is truly about the future of our country and the direction we go. It's about our democracy.\"\n\nRecent polling from the Wason Center showed that Luria and her opponent, Jen Kiggans , a state senator, are tied at 45% among likely voters, with 8% undecided. Kiggans declined to be interviewed for this story.\n\n\"Suffolk is really the key to winning this race and holding this seat,\" Luria said in her closing remarks. \"And this seat is the key to holding the majority in the House of Representatives.\"\n\nThe 2nd Congressional District ranks No. 217 on the nonpartisan Cook Political Report's partisan voting index, making it the median between the most Republican and most-Democratic House seats in the nation - effectively the country's swingiest swing district.\n\nThe district, which first elected Luria in 2018, was redrawn recently to be more Republican. Donald Trump, a Republican, carried it in his successful 2016 presidential campaign, but in 2020, Joe Biden became the first Democratic presidential candidate since 1964 to carry Virginia Beach, part of the district.\n\nLuria's moderate bearing and record would seem suited to the district, but Kiggans has emphasized economic issues and tried to tether Luria to Biden, and both are appealing to a broad cross section of voters for the first time.\n\n\"The year after redistricting is always interesting, slash challenging, because you do in some instances have to reintroduce yourself to new voters, to a new constituency,\" said Susan Swecker, chair of the Virginia Democratic Party.\n\nAnd that's what Luria has been doing for the past year with the 40% of voters who are new in the sprawling district, including voters in Suffolk who face issues that are different from those in other parts. The 2nd District, in southeastern Virginia, continues to include Virginia Beach and curves from the Eastern Shore into Suffolk, Isle of Wight and other localities.\n\nLuria's campaign has fine-tuned its pitch to focus on access to abortion, military and veterans issues and what she calls the ongoing threat to American democracy. She has cited her service on the Jan. 6 committee as \"the most important thing\" she's ever done professionally - more than the two decades she served in the Navy, including as a nuclear-trained surface warfare officer who commanded 400 crewmembers in the Persian Gulf.\n\n\"People said to me, 'Elaine, you're the only Democrat in a Republican district on this committee, what's that going to mean? When you go back home, this might not be popular,'\" Luria told volunteers at an event Oct. 29. \"And I said it doesn't matter. This is the right thing to do.\"\n\n\"And if that means I don't get reelected,\" she added, \"that's OK. Because I'm on the right side of history.\"\n\nLuria has invoked her service oath as a major reason she chose to be on the committee, which is a message that has connected with some in a district where the population overwhelmingly includes active-duty military, veterans and residents who work at the local shipyards.\n\nBut, according to the Wason Center polling, voters said economic concerns were driving their choices in the election, with nearly 40% considering it the most important issue, followed by abortion at 17% and threats to democracy at 14%.\n\nLuria's opponent, Kiggans, also a Navy veteran, has said the election won't be decided by the Jan. 6 committee.\n\n\"I have never had a single voter, or person (whose) door I've knocked on, or civic league I've visited or event I've attended, I've never had a single person come up to me and say that this is the main issue they're focused on,\" Kiggans told The Associated Press in July. \"On a daily basis, I hear over and over and over again about gas prices and grocery prices and grocery shortages and how much everything is costing them.\"\n\nBut for a number of Black voters in the district, the issue of the economy is not the most important thing on the ballot.\n\n\"We understand that the economy is going to ebb and flow. But when we start dealing with overturning women's rights, it takes us back to the issue of our civil rights,\" said Ebony Wright, a Navy veteran and Black resident of Suffolk. \"And so when we start scaling back, it's scary. And then it makes us wonder what is next.\" She said she will vote for Luria.\n\nHer neighbor Selena Thornton, who is also a Black veteran, said the reality and history of the Suffolk area, miles away from where the Nat Turner slave rebellion took place in 1831 and near sundown areas, constantly remind her that she is not as far removed from her ancestors as some may believe. And she said that is why Luria is also her choice.\n\n\"If you want to know the Black vote, that it's right there: There's always going to be a fear of us moving backward instead of forward,\" Wright said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Sarah Rankin in Richmond, Va., contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the 2022 midterm elections at https://apnews.com/hub/2022-midterm-elections .

(Elizabeth Conley/Houston Chronicle via AP)\n\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) - Joe Biden was spending the final days of the presidential campaign appealing to Black supporters to vote in-person during a pandemic that has disproportionally affected their communities, betting that a strong turnout will boost his chances in states that could decide the election.\n\nBiden was in Philadelphia on Sunday, the largest city in what is emerging as the most hotly contested battleground in the closing 48 hours of the campaign. He participated in a \"souls to the polls\" event that is part of a nationwide effort to organize Black churchgoers to vote.\n\n\"Every single day we're seeing race-based disparities in every aspect of this virus,\" Biden said at the drive-in event, shouting to be heard over the blaring car horns. He declared that Trump's handling of COVID-19 was \"almost criminal\" and that the pandemic was a \"mass casualty event in the Black community.\"\n\nHis running mate, Sen. Kamala Harris, was in Georgia, a longtime Republican stronghold that Democrats believe could flip if Black voters show up in force. The first Black woman on a major party's presidential ticket, she encouraged a racially diverse crowd in a rapidly growing Atlanta suburb to \"honor the ancestors\" by voting, invoking the memory of the late civil rights legend, longtime Rep. John Lewis. She later campaigned in Goldsboro and Fayetteville, North Carolina, two cities with a large share of Black voters.\n\nBut even as 93 million Americans have cast ballots and election officials prepare to count, President Donald Trump was already threatening litigation to stop the tabulation of ballots arriving after Election Day. As soon as polls closed in battlegrounds such as Pennsylvania, Trump said, \"we're going in with our lawyers.\"\n\nIt was unclear precisely what Trump meant. There is already an appeal pending at the Supreme Court over the counting of absentee ballots in Pennsylvania that are received in the mail in the three days after the election.\n\nThe state's top court ordered the extension and the Supreme Court refused to block it, though conservative justices expressed interest in taking up the propriety of the three added days after the election. Those ballots are being kept separate in case the litigation goes forward. The issue could assume enormous importance if the late-arriving ballots could tip the outcome.\n\nBiden is focusing on turning out Black voters in the final stretch in part to avoid a narrow outcome that could prompt Trump to seek an advantage in the courts.\n\nIt's a challenging dynamic because Democrats have spent months pushing their supporters to vote by mail. But their energy has shifted to urge Black supporters who have long preferred to vote in person or distrust voting by mail to get out on Tuesday.\n\nA Biden path toward victory must include Black majority cities, including Philadelphia and Detroit, which will be crucial in determining the outcome in Pennsylvania and Michigan. Those are states where both candidates have spent a significant amount of time in the final days of the 2020 election.\n\n\"The historical but also cultural reality for our community is that Election Day represents a collective political act and it's a continuation of our struggle for full citizenship in this country,\" said Adrianne Shropshire, the executive director of BlackPAC. \"Black voters are showing up in ways that they did not in 2016 and we can take heart in that.\"\n\nIn Detroit, officials are projecting a 50% voter turnout, which would be higher than 2016, yet lower than 2008 and 2012 when Obama's candidacy drew record voter participation. Grassroots organizers in the Philadelphia area have spent months engaging potential voters, many of whom they expect will be casting ballots for the first time on Election Day.\n\n\"Most Black voters in Philly have been skeptical of mail-in voting,\" said Joe Hill, a veteran Democratic operative-turned-lobbyist from the city. \"A lot of us have gotten our ballots already,\" Hill said, but added, \"Election Day has always been everything in Philadelphia.\"\n\nHealthcare Pennsylvania, a local union chapter of the Service Employees International Union, is working to increase turnout by at least 10,000 in west Philadelphia and spent the weekend knocking on more than 600 doors. West Philadelphia has a majority Black population and has experienced firsthand the convergence of the pandemic's disproportionate impact on Black Americans and protests in recent days against police brutality, mirroring what's occurred nationwide.\n\nBiden has also drawn a sharp contrast to Trump through a summer of unrest over the police killings of Breonna Taylor in Kentucky and George Floyd in Minneapolis. Their deaths sparked the largest protest movement since the civil rights era. Biden responded by acknowledging the systemic racism that pervades American life, while Trump emphasized his support of police and pivoted to a \"law and order\" message that resonated with his base but did little to broaden his appeal.\n\nFour years ago, Trump made his pitch to voters of color by bellowing \"What have you got to lose?\" in supporting the Republican candidate and aides have pointed to pre-pandemic economic gains by people of color.\n\nHe only won 8% of the Black vote, but in a development that has haunted Democrats for four years, Clinton's margin fell 7 percentage points from Obama's in 2012, according to Pew Research Center.\n\nThere's little chance that Trump will win all that many more Black voters this year, though his campaign believes it has made inroads with young Black men. The president's primary strategy has been to erode Biden's support with a barrage of negative advertisements.\n\nOne replays Biden's eyebrow-raising \"you ain't Black\" comment, in which the former vice president questioned how African Americans could support Trump. Another uses the Democrat's own past words in support of the 1994 crime bill against him. The bill, which Biden helped write, led to stiffer prison sentences that disproportionately incarcerated Black men.\n\nTrump, in a tweet Sunday, claimed that Biden called young Black man \"superpredators\" - which he did not do, though he used the term \"predators\" in a 1993 floor speech to describe criminals.\n\nBiden, who has a massive cash advantage over Trump, has flooded the airwaves with uplifting ads that prominently feature African Americans. One minute-long spot detailing Biden's proposals to help Black people begins with Biden explicitly stating, \"Black lives matter. Period. I'm not afraid to say it.\"\n\n___\n\nLemire reported from Washington, Stafford from Detroit and Miller from Charlotte.

Shelly Echols, R-Gainesville speaks on behalf of SB1EX, the Senate redistricting act, in the Senate Chambers during a Special Session at the Georgia State Capitol, Friday, Dec. 1, 2023, in Atlanta. (Jason Getz/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP)\n\nATLANTA (AP) - A push by Georgia Republicans to maintain their congressional majority is likely to come down to a decades-old legal question that has never been settled by the U.S. Supreme Court - does federal law protect voting districts where a coalition of nonwhite voters hold sway?\n\nThe question was a key part of debate Monday as a Senate committee voted 7-4 along party lines to advance the proposed congressional map . It could be debated Tuesday before the full state Senate.\n\nRepublicans pushing redistricting plans in Georgia say such districts aren't protected by the federal Voting Rights Act. Thus, they say it's legal for them to target a district now represented by Democratic U.S. Rep Lucy McBath for a drastic transformation, even as they draw a new Black-majority district elsewhere in metro Atlanta. Such a 1-for-1 switch in districts likely to elect a Democrat would mean Republicans are likely to maintain their 9-5 edge in Georgia's congressional delegation. That's despite nearly half of voters casting ballots for Democrats in recent statewide elections.\n\nLawmakers were called into special session after U.S. District Judge Steve Jones ruled in October that Georgia's congressional, state Senate and state House maps violate federal law by diluting Black voting power. Jones mandated Black majorities in one additional congressional district, two additional state Senate districts and five additional state House districts. Jones instructed lawmakers to create the new congressional district on metro Atlanta's western side.\n\nJones wrote in his order that Georgia can't fix its problems \"by eliminating minority opportunity districts elsewhere.\" Senate Reapportionment and Redistricting Committee Chairwoman Shelly Echols, a Gainesville Republican, has said repeatedly that Republicans are interpreting minority opportunity to mean majority-Black.\n\n\"A minority opportunity district must be a district where a single racial group is a majority,\" Echols said Monday.\n\nBut the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which oversees Georgia, Florida, and Alabama, ruled in a 1990 case from Hardee County, Florida, that minority coalitions are protected from having their votes diluted. That precedent is likely to be front and center in arguments over whether U.S. District Judge Steve Jones should accept new maps drawn by Georgia lawmakers.\n\nMcBath's current 7th District includes southern Gwinnett County and northern Fulton County. No ethnic group has a majority in the district, but Black, Asian and Hispanic voters collectively favor Democrats. That district would be carved up between two Democratic and two Republican incumbents. Lawmakers would instead create a new majority-Black 6th District in Cobb, Douglas, Fulton and Fayette counties.\n\n\"District 7 was a minority opportunity district in our view. Yes, it was a coalition. But it was very strongly a minority coalition with around 67% minority voters,\" said Ken Lawler of Fair Districts GA, a group that opposes partisan gerrymandering in redistricting. He said he disagrees with Echols' interpretation that minority opportunity means only majority Black.\n\nBesides congressional districts, minority coalitions could also be an issue in Georgia's new state legislative maps, which are moving toward final passage.\n\nBut the precedents protecting minority coalition districts are on shaky ground. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which oversees Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, had ruled like the 11th Circuit that such districts were protected. But that court has agreed to hear an appeal of a Galveston County, Texas, case seeking to overturn the 5th Circuit's position. And another circuit court in 1996 rejected protection for a minority coalition in a Michigan county.\n\nIt's the second time in two years that Republicans have targeted McBath, a gun control activist. McBath, who is Black, initially won election in a majority-white district in Atlanta's northern suburbs. After her district was redrawn to favor Republicans, McBath jumped into the 7th District and beat Democratic incumbent Carolyn Bordeaux in a 2022 primary .\n\nChanges would also be made to six other congressional districts in parts of metro Atlanta. Five districts south and east of Atlanta would remain untouched.\n\nDemocrats say the changes seek to evade Jones' goal of enhancing Black representation.\n\n\"This really does diminish the Black voice and the Black vote,\" said Sen. Tonya Anderson, a Lithonia Democrat. \"And it's all over this map from District 10 to congressional District 7. This is not a good representation of who we are and where we are going.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/Carlos Osorio)\n\nDETROIT (AP) - Donald Trump blamed immigrants for stealing jobs and government resources as he courted separate groups of Black voters and hardcore conservatives in battleground Michigan on Saturday.\n\nThe Republican former president also made several new baseless claims attacking the nation's voting system.\n\nBut Trump's fiery comments on illegal immigration, long a staple in his unapologetic message, marked a connecting theme in downtown Detroit as he sought to stitch together a delicate political coalition at both a Black church and a group known to attract white supremacists.\n\n\"The people coming across the border - all those millions of people - they're inflicting tremendous harm to our Black population and to our Hispanic population,\" Trump told a cheering crowd of thousands of conservative activists packed into a vast convention hall.\n\n\"They're not human beings. They're animals,\" he said later in referencing members of violent immigrant gangs.\n\nTrump's diverse weekend schedule underscores the evolving political forces shaping the presidential election this fall as he tries to deny Democratic President Joe Biden a second term.\n\nFew states may matter more in November than Michigan, which Biden carried by less than 3 percentage points four years ago. And few voting groups matter more to Democrats than African Americans, who made up the backbone of Biden's political base in 2020. But now, less than five months before Election Day, Black voters are expressing modest signs of disappointment with the 81-year-old Democrat.\n\nTrump, who turned 78 on Friday, is fighting to take advantage of his apparent opening.\n\nHis crowd was far smaller, but also warmly receptive, when he visited the 180 Church earlier in the day. Derelict vehicles sat outside the modest brick building with \"Black Americans for Trump\" signs affixed. Rap music and barbecue smoke wafted from a pre-event gathering organized by the Black Conservative Federation group.\n\n\"It's a very important area for us,\" Trump told the church crowd, which included a significant number of white people. He promised to return \"some Sunday\" for a sermon.\n\nHe argued that the Black community \"is being hurt\" by immigrants in the country illegally.\n\n\"They're invading your jobs,\" he said.\n\nTrump offered a similar message later in the day while addressing the \"People's Convention\" of Turning Point Action, a group that the Anti-Defamation League says has been linked to a variety of extremists.\n\nRoughly 24 hours before the former president spoke, well-known white supremacist Nick Fuentes entered the hall surrounded by a group of cheering supporters. Security quickly escorted him out, but Fuentes created political problems for Trump after attending a private lunch with the former president and the rapper formerly known as Kanye West at Trump's Florida estate in 2022.\n\nTurning Point has emerged as a force in GOP politics in the Trump era, particularly among his \"Make America Great Again\" movement, despite the Anti-Defamation League's warning that the group \"continues to attract racists.\"\n\n\"Numerous individuals associated with the group have made bigoted statements about the Black community, the LGBTQ community and other groups,\" the ADL, an international anti-hate group, wrote in a background memo. \"While TPUSA (Turning Point USA) leaders say they reject white supremacist ideology, known white nationalists have attended their events.\"\n\nTurning Point spokesperson Andrew Kolvet dismissed the ADL's characterization as \"smears and lies.\" He added that Turning Point has been blocking Fuentes from attending its events for \"years.\"\n\n\"The ADL is a scourge on America, which sows poison and division. They've completely lost the plot,\" Kolvet said, describing the ADL's criticism as \"a badge of honor.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats offered a competing perspective from afar.\n\n\"Donald Trump is so dangerous for Michigan and dangerous for America and dangerous for Black people,\" said Michigan Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist II, who is African American. He called it \"offensive\" for Trump to address the Turning Point conference, which was taking place at the same convention center that was \"the epicenter of their steal the election effort.\"\n\nIndeed, dozens of angry Trump loyalists chanting \"Stop the count!\" descended on the TCF Center, now named Huntington Place, the day after the 2020 presidential election as absentee ballots were being counted. Local media captured scenes of protesters outside and in the lobby. Police prevented them from entering the counting area.\n\nThe protests occurred after Trump had tweeted that \"they are finding Biden votes all over\" in several states, including Michigan.\n\nThe false notion that Biden benefited from widespread voter fraud has been widely debunked by voting officials in both parties, the court system and members of Trump's former administration. Still, Trump continues to promote such misinformation, which echoed throughout the conservative convention over the weekend.\n\nSpeaking from the main stage, Turning Point founder and CEO Charlie Kirk falsely described the conference location as \"the scene of a crime.\"\n\nPitching the conversation forward, Trump raised the possibility of election fraud this fall.\n\n\"We need to watch the vote. We need to guard the vote,\" Trump charged. \"It's so corrupt, the whole election process.\"\n\nSuch extreme rhetoric does not appear to have hurt Trump's standing with Black voters.\n\nAmong Black adults, Biden's approval has dropped from 94% when he started his term in January 2021 to just 55%, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll published in March.\n\nAbout 8 in 10 Black voters have an unfavorable opinion of Trump, with roughly two-thirds saying they have a \"very unfavorable\" view of him, according to an AP-NORC poll conducted in June .\n\nTrump won 8% of the Black vote in 2020, according to AP VoteCast . And in what is expected to be a close election, even a modest shift could be consequential.\n\nOmar Mitchell, a Detroit restaurant owner who participated in the church gathering, said he supports Trump because \"money was pumping\" when he was president.\n\n\"In the old days, how we grew up was just because you're Black means you're a Democrat,\" Mitchell said. \"That's out the door nowadays.\"\n\nTrump argues he can pull in more Black voters due to his economic and border security message, and that his felony indictments make him more relatable. At the church on Saturday afternoon, he repeatedly vowed to \"bring back the auto industry\" while also noting, \"The crime is most rampant right here and African American communities.\"\n\nKimberly Taylor, who was invited on stage at the church by the Trump campaign, thanked Trump for \"coming to the hood,\" while pastor Lorenzo Sewell said Biden attended an NAACP dinner in the city \"but never came to the hood.\"\n\nThe pastor asked Trump how to \"keep the Black dollar in the Black community.\"\n\nThe Black community, Trump said, \"needs to stop the crime.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Will Weissert and Linley Sanders in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Solis)\n\nJACKSON, Miss. (AP) - A few years ago, Tiffany Wilburn just didn't see the point in voting any longer.\n\nHer children didn't have proper school books, health insurance was expensive and hard to get, police abuse continued against Black residents, and her city's struggle to get clean drinking water seemed emblematic of her community always coming out on the short end of state decision-making.\n\nCombine that with Mississippi's long history of voter suppression and she felt casting a ballot was simply a hopeless exercise.\n\n\"It's like you're not being heard,\" Wilburn said in her hometown of Jackson, the state capital. \"You run to the polls, hoping and praying for change, and then you look around and nothing's really happening. So you shut down.\"\n\nRecent interviews with Black voters, voting rights groups, candidates and researchers show that the voter fatigue felt by Wilburn has been widely shared in a state where nearly 40% of the overall population is Black. This year, political dynamics have combined to begin changing that, leading many voters such as Wilburn to reengage.\n\nThe race for governor appears competitive and is drawing national attention. Tuesday's election also happens to be the first one in Mississippi to be held without the burden of an unusual post-Reconstruction constitutional provision that had made it virtually impossible for Black candidates to win on a statewide basis.\n\nFive Black candidates are running for statewide office, from agriculture commissioner to secretary of state. Each is trying to become the first Black candidate to ever win one of those posts.\n\nMonitors review a card with a submitted question from an attendee during a candidates forum, Oct. 26, 2023, in Vicksburg, Miss. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)\n\nVoting rights advocates hope the changes will encourage a rebuilding of the Black community's voting base and provide a tail wind to Democrats in a state that is now mostly controlled by Republicans.\n\n\"Black people here aren't scared to vote and do care because it impacts all of us, our entire livelihood,\" said Glennard Warren, a 66-year-old voter in Vicksburg. \"Now it's more important that we enhance and educate all voters, especially Black people. But the voting process isn't necessarily sound and there are many constraints that we're facing like gerrymandering, purging of voter rolls - it's a lot. But I'm going and taking everyone I can with me.\"\n\nWhite leaders of both parties used numerous tactics over several decades to suppress the Black vote, from poll taxes to literacy tests. Among the most pernicious was a provision slipped into the Mississippi Constitution in 1890 that required candidates for governor and other statewide offices to win not only a majority of the vote, but also a majority of the state's 122 House districts.\n\nAfter a lawsuit, voters in 2020 repealed it , ensuring that candidates just had to win a simple statewide majority. Some voting rights groups and candidates said that provides an opening, not just for this year's candidates, but also to start expanding their voter base.\n\nAn attendee to a candidates forum reviews the event program that list those people seeking a statewide office in the November 7 election, in addition to a reminder of the general election and the general runoff of Nov. 28, in Vicksburg, Miss., on Oct. 26, 2023. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)\n\nRobert Bradford, the Democratic nominee for state agriculture commissioner, said repealing that part of the constitution will open doors for Black candidates to succeed in the years to come. He joined with several other Democratic candidates to engage with voters who had become disenchanted, thinking their voice would never make a difference in the state.\n\n\"We've got to sow those seeds in areas that never had anything grown,\" he said. \"We met people who felt like, 'Why vote because nothing's going to happen?' It's that mindset and those feelings that we have to address.\"\n\nBlack voters in the state still face a disproportionate burden. A common complaint is about a purging of voter rolls that has caused problems for Black voters as recently as this year's August primary.\n\nTaylor Turnage of the Mississippi Votes Action Fund had to file a provisional ballot after she went to her polling place and found her name had been removed from the rolls.\n\n\"I've been voting in Tougaloo for several years with no problems. But when I went, I was told, 'You're not in the system,'\" she said. \"You're purging people who are actually voting now? If people don't know they're purged until Election Day, it's too late then.\"\n\nU.S. Air Force veteran and retired postal worker, James Robinson, 90, left, speaks with other attendees at a candidates forum, Oct. 26, 2023, in Vicksburg, Miss. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)\n\nAmong the remaining hurdles is another part of the state constitution that strips voting rights from people who have committed certain felonies, a provision that also dates to 1890.\n\nCritics say the named crimes were ones the white power structure thought Black people were more likely to commit. In 2009, a former Democratic state attorney general issued an opinion that expanded the list to 22 crimes, including timber larceny, carjacking, felony shoplifting and passing bad checks.\n\n\"We have to have conversations about what's still on the books -- because that repeal is done, but the work isn't over,\" said Danyelle Holmes, a national social justice organizer for Repairers of the Breach, a group that advocates for voting rights, democracy and a range of social issues. \"That's how we get to the root of the fatigue.\"\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court declined to reconsider a 2022 decision by the conservative 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that said Mississippi had remedied the discriminatory intent of the original provisions by altering the list of disenfranchising crimes.\n\nMany other states in recent years have taken steps to reinstate voting rights for former felons. In Mississippi, more than 10% of Black adults are formerly incarcerated, according to a 2022 report by The Sentencing Project.\n\nRonald Graham-Wilson, 21, expresses his uncertainty in who he plans to vote for in the upcoming statewide elections this year and federal elections in 2024, during a roundtable discussion with other youth community activists, on elections, race and voter fatigue, Oct. 25, 2023, in Jackson, Miss. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)\n\n\"That's a huge percentage. If the elections were close and that 10% could vote, it very well could sway the elections,\" said Marvin King, a professor at the University of Mississippi who focuses on African American politics.\n\nMore recent events have contributed to a sense of embattlement in the Black community.\n\nIn particular, a 2022 water crisis in Jackson left most of the 150,000 residents in the majority Black city without running water for several days after heavy rains damaged one of the water-treatment plants. Residents lamented the government's lack of attention to their basic needs.\n\nLast spring, Republican Gov. Tate Reeves, who faces a reelection challenge from Democrat Brandon Presley, signed into law a major change passed by the Republican-controlled and majority white Legislature that created special courts with appointed judges in the county that includes Jackson.\n\nTwo lawsuits challenged it, arguing that the Mississippi Constitution requires most judges to be elected. Critics also said it was another way to make it harder for Black voters to elect candidates of their choice. In September, the Mississippi Supreme Court blocked the appointment of the circuit court judges but allowed a new lower-level court with one appointed judge.\n\nTy Pinkins, the Democratic nominee for secretary of state, took notice, citing his extensive history in suing the state for similar offenses in the past.\n\n\"We're here to make sure that doesn't continue to happen,\" he said during a candidates' rally in Vicksburg.\n\nBlack voters are listening, but some said boosting engagement is a two-way street: If they show up to vote, it has to be translated into action. That sentiment is especially strong on college campuses, a focal point of several of the Black candidates running for statewide office.\n\nStudents at Jackson State University, a historically Black college, want to see candidates spend time on campus discussing the priorities of the youngest voting generation.\n\n\"If I were to put myself in a candidate's shoes, I would actually go on campus not to get votes but to understand,\" said Austin Crudup, a 23-year-old student. \"Ask what is something that you would like me to fix or change? What could I do to make your life a little bit easier?\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Jackson, Mississippi, and Gary Fields in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press coverage of race and voting receives support from the Jonathan Logan Family Foundation.

Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nD onald Trump's history of racism is breathtaking. His track record of prejudice is so prodigious that keeping all of the incidents straight is difficult: There's the Central Park Five, the \"Muslim ban,\" his response to Charlottesville. \"Shithole\" countries and lamenting that Nigerian immigrants won't \"go back to their huts.\" The fabrications about Haitians eating pets. There's Sunday's horrifying Madison Square Garden rally , where Trump surrogates made racist comments about Harris and Puerto Rico. The list goes on. And grows. You would be hard-pressed to find a more brazenly racist major American politician on this side of the Civil Rights Act.\n\nFuture historians will therefore marvel at the fact that Trump has increased his support among African Americans since he was elected to the presidency in 2016. No serious person expects Trump to win anything close to a majority of Black voters in this year's election. But months upon months of polls-from a welter of different pollsters-predict Trump substantially growing his share of those voters, particularly young Black men . In a recent poll of Black voters, 58 percent of Black men said they'd support Vice President Kamala Harris if the election were held today, and 26 percent said they'd vote for Trump-a percentage that would represent record-setting support for a Republican candidate.\n\nOther forms of evidence- shoe-leather reporting , first-person testimony , 16 years of declining Black male support for Democratic presidential candidates, the presence of the Black manosphere -suggest that we are in the midst of a substantial racial realignment . If Democratic candidates have long benefited from Black magic-the near-universal support of African Americans-the spell has been broken for a growing share of Black men. Now Democrats, including the Harris campaign, are trying to figure out how to cast a new one. But the chances of stopping the realignment appear slim, because Black voters are both more culturally conservative and more economically liberal than the current version of the Democratic Party.\n\nRead: Why do Black people vote for Democrats?\n\nL auren Harper Pope , a political and communications strategist, told me politicians need to start thinking of Black men-in contrast to more reliably Democratic Black women-as politically independent. \"I've been telling people for months: Black men, Hispanic men, minority men are independent voters,\" she said. \"People need to look past the concept that if you're a Black man with a college degree, you're going to vote for a Democrat. No. Absolutely not. I've got plenty of Black friends who have college degrees who are from the South, not from the South, whatever, who are genuinely concerned about things the Democratic Party is doing.\"\n\nSharon Wright Austin, a political scientist at the University of Florida, also believes that some level of realignment is happening. \"I do think we have to take the polls seriously, because they are showing that Donald Trump is getting more support among Black men,\" she told me. \"I don't know if the numbers are going to be as high as the polls indicate. I do think there are going to be some African Americans who are going to vote for Trump because they find him to be a better candidate.\" Austin noted that the strength of the economy under Trump, as well as some Black men's discomfort with Democratic positions on cultural issues such as abortion , trans rights , and immigration , are likely driving some of this defection.\n\nOther political scientists who specialize in Black politics contest the idea that Black voting habits are meaningfully changing. Justin Zimmerman, a political-science professor at the University of Albany, said that the kind of frustration Black men are exhibiting isn't new. \"It's not so much that there's no Black political disenchantment with the Democratic Party,\" Zimmerman told me. \"That's always been there.\" He said that most rankled African Americans will likely hold their nose and vote for a candidate they may not be enthusiastic about, something Black voters have had to do throughout American history.\n\nChristopher Towler, who directs the Black Voter Project and is a partner at Black Insights Research, also dismissed the notion that African Americans are undergoing a meaningful transition away from the Democratic Party. He argues that polls frequently rely on small sample sizes of Black voters, which makes getting a representative cross-section of the Black community impossible.\n\n\"You have a sample that has [18 to19] percent support for Trump, but it has a nine-point margin of error,\" Towler told me. \"That means it could be as low as 10 or as high as 27 percent. That tells us absolutely nothing.\"\n\nAlthough this point about sample size is reasonable and was echoed by other political scientists I interviewed, it fails to explain why those sample-size errors would lead to polling consistently skewed in one direction. And, more important, it discounts historical trends: Democrats have been bleeding male Black voters for nearly two decades.\n\nSome degree of realignment was probably inevitable, given the widening mismatch between the worldview of many Black men and that of the Democratic Party. Many Black voters are quite conservative , especially culturally, and they may hold views on issues like abortion and gender that are more at home in the Republican Party. In June, the Pew Research Center released what is perhaps the most comprehensive recent survey of American opinions about fraught cultural issues. Conducted when Joe Biden was still the Democrats' presidential nominee, Pew's polling illustrates notable contrasts between the views of Black and white supporters of the Democratic candidate. On an array of cultural questions, Black Biden supporters were not simply more conservative than their white peers; they were more conservative than any other demographic group in the Democratic coalition.\n\nPew found that Black Biden supporters were the least likely to answer questions about immigrants favorably, trailing white supporters by double digits. Similarly, Black Biden voters were about twice as likely to say that \"an emphasis on marriage and family makes society better off\" compared with their white counterparts. And whereas only 32 percent of white Biden supporters agreed that \"gender is determined by a person's sex assigned at birth,\" 64 percent of Black Biden voters said they agreed. Black Biden voters were also much less likely than any other group of Biden voters to say they were comfortable with they / them pronouns. When the questions turned to religion, the differences were even more stark: 35 percent of Black Biden voters said \"government should support religious values\" and more than half-a higher percentage than among Trump supporters -said \"belief in God is needed for morality.\" Only 7 and 8 percent of white Biden supporters, respectively, said the same. A different Pew survey from the same period also found that majorities of Black men and Black women agreed that \"the government [promotes] birth control and abortion to keep the Black population small.\" Again, these polls were not conducted when Harris was the candidate, but there is little reason to believe that cultural attitudes among Black Democrats suddenly changed when she became the nominee.\n\nS ince Trump's rise , Democrats have seemed to assume that if they yell about his racism, misogyny, and authoritarian tendencies enough, African Americans will be scared or shamed into voting for Hillary Clinton, Biden, and now Harris. Eight years ago, the Clinton campaign dropped an ad tying Trump to Ku Klux Klan members; after she lost the election, she warned that Trump supporters wanted to take away the rights of Black Americans. For this year's presidential race, the Harris campaign has commissioned former President Barack Obama to scold Black men for allegedly being too sexist to vote for the first Black woman president. Harris is hammering messages about fascism, racism, and democracy in the campaign's final week even though polls have shown that these talking points are among the least popular with voters of all kinds-to say nothing of the fact that Black voters have been moving toward Trump despite nearly a decade of those messages being shouted from a bullhorn.\n\nDemocrats seem unwilling to believe that a small but significant portion of Black voters might be willing to overlook Trump's racism, and are even drawn to aspects of his nationalism, xenophobia, and traditionalism. When Biden won in 2020, many liberal talking heads cheered that \"Black voters saved democracy\" and heaped praise on Black \"superhero women\" as part of an outpouring of awkward gratitude that several Black pundits noted was a little fetishistic and traded in \"magical negro tropes.\" Some progressives seem to imagine minority voters as mythical beings, electoral angels who radiate light and virtue. In their minds, the Democratic Party is a Marvel movie coalition of Nice Whites and Saintly Blacks and Browns who team up every four years to try to save the country from the Bad Whites: the hodgepodge of unsavory working-class whites and car-dealership-owning whites and Christian-nationalist whites who make up Trump's coalition. But people of color are people, not saints or saintly monoliths, and the cost of this idealization has been a certain blindness in Democratic circles to the actual, rather than imagined, political landscape within minority communities. And it's not just African Americans: Other male minority voters are also generally less liberal than white Democrats. Recent polls found that 44 percent of young Latino men back Trump and more than half of Hispanic men support deportations of undocumented immigrants (51 percent) and building the border wall (52 percent). These men are more than twice as likely to say Trump, compared with Biden, helped them personally.\n\nThe question, then, is what to do about these growing tensions between the cultural views of Black Americans and other minority voters and those of the Democratic Party. Despite their competing views on realignment, the experts I spoke with largely agreed that Democrats tend to take Black voters for granted, and that the Harris campaign should have started doing targeted outreach to Black voters much sooner. \"What Black folks want is an identifiable, explicit agenda,\" the political scientist Sekou Franklin told me, one that appeals to their unique needs and interests. He added, \"That's what they're seeing with LGBTQ+ persons ... That's what they're seeing with women, so they want the same thing.\" Others said that some in the Black community think too much money is going to help foreign countries overseas, while Black Americans-especially Black men-struggle at home. Black Americans are among the least supportive of sending military aid to Ukraine and Israel .\n\nDaniel K. Williams: Democrats can't rely on the Black Church anymore\n\nWhat Harris has offered to combat these perceptions has been less than inspiring. Trying to court young Black men with policy proposals on crypto, weed legalization, and mentorship programs-the focus of a recent policy rollout-is both confusing and condescending . One ambitious proposal, handing out loans to Black Americans on the basis of race, is very possibly illegal , and thus likely an empty promise. And although Harris has moved to the right explicitly and implicitly on a number of cultural and economic issues , there is approximately zero chance that she can outflank Donald Trump on problems such as immigration, no matter how much she wants to expand the border wall . Anyone whose primary concern is the southern border is almost certainly going to vote for the former president. So if shifting right on cultural and social issues is unlikely to move the needle, what will?\n\nThe answer is staring Democrats in the face. If Black voters are perhaps the most culturally conservative wing of the Democratic coalition, they also tend to be among the most progressive on economic issues. A survey this summer found that Black voters are almost twice as likely as other racial demographics to say that \"the government should provide more assistance to people in need\" and also more likely than any other group to say that Social Security benefits should be expanded. And roughly two-thirds of African Americans say that the government should have a more active hand in solving problems. Another survey found that a majority of African Americans have critical views of the country's prison system (74 percent), courts (70 percent), policing (68 percent), big businesses (67 percent), economic system (65 percent), and health-care system (51 percent). These are issues that the Democratic Party can credibly claim to be better at addressing than Republicans.\n\nBlack voters' realignment seems less like a sea change than something akin to coastal erosion: a grinding process that can be stopped with concerted collective effort. Democrats cannot out-Republican the Republicans on cultural issues, and it would be a fool's errand to try. What they can do is spend the final days of the campaign playing to their strengths : loudly championing the kind of bold populist vision that is actually popular with voters, including African Americans ."

      "text": "Bernie Sanders Reached Out to Black Voters. Why Didn't It Work?\n\nThe democratic socialist champions underrepresented groups. So far they've voted, en masse, for his rival.\n\nTwo years ago, Bernie Sanders journeyed south to trace the history of a past revolution, and to imagine a new one.\n\nOn April 4, 2018, the 50th anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., thousands of people gathered on Beale Street in Memphis, Tennessee, for a rally and a march. Sanders was one of the speakers. He took the stage and gripped the podium with one hand, the microphone with the other. \"Dr. King was not just a great civil-rights leader,\" Sanders, who had not officially announced that he would run for president again, said . \"He was a nonviolent revolutionary!\" The crowd broke into applause as he paused for a moment. \"He was a man who wanted to transform our country morally, economically, and racially.\" It wasn't enough to simply remember King, Sanders explained: People needed to follow in his footsteps.\n\nLater that day he traveled farther south, to Jackson, Mississippi, where, in June 1963, the famous civil-right activist Medgar Evers-who led economic boycotts and voter-registration drives in the state-was murdered in his driveway by a white supremacist after an NAACP meeting. The city's mayor is now Chokwe Antar Lumumba, a 36-year-old who wants to make Jackson the most \" radical city on the planet.\" Onstage at the Thalia Mara Concert Hall, the pair had an hour-long conversation about economic exploitation- one of the three evils King railed against-and economic justice.\n\nEach stop on Sanders's journey through the South doubled as early outreach to a demographic he would desperately need if and when he sought the presidency again.\n\nRead: The establishment strikes back.\n\nSanders's agenda-dismantling broken systems and replacing them with ones that benefit working-class people, regardless of race-is intimately bound up with the nation's civil-rights legacy. But, some argue, Sanders has struggled to clearly articulate that connection in a way that earns black voters' support.\n\nWhen Sanders first ran for president, in 2016, he excited white progressives who were not interested in Hillary Clinton's brand of moderate politics. His base was young and energetic, but it was light on black support. Sure, a small majority of black voters under 30 supported him, but they made up just 3 percent of the black electorate in the primary. Black activists argued that his campaign did not pay enough attention to racial violence and inequities in the criminal-justice system. His speeches were frequently interrupted by members of Black Lives Matter, who sought to push candidates to be more aggressive on racial issues. They attempted similar protests of Clinton but were stymied. (At least on one occasion, they were blocked at the door by Secret Service agents.) Clinton's events were stage-managed to the finest detail; Sanders's were more DIY and raucous.\n\nSanders has admitted that his 2016 campaign was \" too white .\" Indeed, his inability to excite a large group of voters beyond his majority-white base led to a pummeling across the South. Older black voters knew Clinton; Sanders was the one rolling the boulder uphill. He lost the black vote by 90 percent in Arkansas, by 86 percent in South Carolina, and by 89 percent in Tennessee. In Missouri, where he lost by the slim margin of 0.2 percent, he lost the black vote by 67 percent.\n\nFor many voters, the 2016 election was their first introduction to the Vermont senator with the unkempt hair and radical ideas. He knew more people would know his name if he ran again in 2020, but he needed to do more: He needed to hire a more diverse staff, attend events at historically black colleges and universities, speak to black media and black people directly, and, perhaps more than anything, listen to black voices.\n\nHe did all that. But despite his efforts, the support never quite materialized. From the South Carolina primary through Super Tuesday, among black voters, Sanders was trounced by former Vice President Joe Biden. Sanders offered a revolution; voters rebuffed it. The black people who did support Sanders tended to be younger-and young people tend to vote at lower rates than older people do .\n\nTonight, exit polls showed that Sanders lost the black vote in Mississippi by 71 points-84 percent of black voters supported Biden, and just 13 percent supported Sanders. Sanders's performance among black voters was just 2 percentage points better than it was in 2016. Cable networks called the race as soon as the polls closed: another decisive victory in the South for Biden.\n\nThe stagnant numbers raise interesting questions: Does Sanders's revolution simply need more time? Did voters not know enough about what his policies could do for them? Or, more plainly, did they simply prefer Biden? If the Sanders movement- Not me. Us- is going to win, either now or in the future, it needs to figure out a way to sway southern black voters to its cause.\n\nSome black people in the South are already on board for radical change, though, and they are trying to bring others with them.\n\nRead: A warning to the Democratic Party about black voters.\n\nLumumba, whose beard is just beginning to show flecks of gray at its ends, is a rising star of progressive politics. And he's seen the limitations of politics as practiced.\n\n\"No matter who's been president, no matter whether we've been told that the economy is thriving or we're in a recession, we've still been at the bottom,\" Lumumba told me during his layover in Atlanta on Friday. He was headed to Detroit to join Sanders for a rally before the Michigan primary. \"People may participate in the pageantry because they don't believe that it's really going to affect their lives in a grand way.\"\n\nVoting becomes pageantry when those who do so aren't able to actively engage with the candidates, their staffs, and, most important, their ideas, he said. A contender shouldn't become the candidate through an exercise less participatory than procedural, he argued. He hoped that the people of his city-which is more than 80 percent black-would be able to experience the political process more deeply this time around.\n\nIn mid-February, Arekia Bennett, an organizer with Mississippi Votes and the Movement for Black Lives, staged a \"people's caucus,\" which involved more than 100 residents of Jackson. The event gave voters a chance to hear directly from staff members representing several candidates, including Biden, Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Michael Bloomberg. Sanders won the caucus's mock vote overwhelmingly, and Lumumba based his endorsement on that result.\n\nIt was an intimate experience, the kind of thing Lumumba had imagined when he and three other southern black mayors wrote an open letter to candidates last September. The letter outlined the roadmap for 2020 Democrats to win not only their support, but the support of their communities. \"We didn't want it to be a perfunctory experience,\" he told me. \"It needed to be substantive.\"\n\nBut a little over 100 people is hardly representative of all of Jackson, a city of roughly 170,000. \"My fear in Jackson, just like my fear around the nation, is that not enough people get a chance to experience that,\" Lumumba confessed. \"That was a small sample size of the city in an atypical situation not only for Jackson to get to experience, but that most other southern states don't get to experience.\"\n\nThe primary process is such that candidates spend inordinate amounts of time and money in very white states-Iowa and New Hampshire-trying to convince voters that they are the right candidate to address their issues. That creates a lopsided process in which voters in places like Sumter County, Alabama, and Leflore County, Mississippi, have very little interaction with the presidential nominating contest. That does not mean voters in these states are uninformed; rather, they are not able to engage with contenders in the same way as they would if they lived in a place like Sioux City, Iowa. \"People feel more comfortable when you can stand toe-to-toe with them and let them know what you stand for,\" Lumumba told me. \"That's their opportunity to kind of gauge your sincerity.\"\n\nSanders has been criticized in recent weeks for skipping events where he might have had the opportunity to engage with more southern black voters. He did not attend the Bloody Sunday march in Selma after losing to Biden in the South Carolina primary, and canceled a rally in Jackson-where he was expected to appear with Lumumba-in order to campaign in the vital primary state of Michigan. (\"I can't imagine the demands of a national campaign,\" Lumumba told me, and Sanders is not a stranger to the city, having held events there in the past, \"so we understand.\")\n\nWhen I asked Lumumba about how the primary process could have gone differently for Sanders, he stopped for a moment. Then he considered how Sanders performed in caucuses rather than primaries; perhaps if there were ranked-choice voting, as in the Jackson people's caucus, Sanders would have won a larger share of black voters. But he kept coming back to a central theme: If only more people knew how radically different their lives could be-perhaps then they would join the revolution.\n\nSanders's movement believes that progressive politics can fundamentally change lives by raising wages and making college affordable and health care more accessible. This is the message Jesse Jackson preached when he ran for president in 1984 and 1988. And it's the one that led Jackson to endorse Sanders on Sunday. \"A people far behind cannot catch up choosing the most moderate path,\" Jackson said.\n\nRead: Joe Biden is the candidate of the resistance.\n\nIf Jackson's endorsement had come prior to Super Tuesday, it might have helped Sanders's stock among older black voters. \"It really anchors the progressive movement to a long-standing civil-rights agenda,\" Katherine Tate, a professor at Brown University who studies black-voter behavior, told me. Her research has shown that black voters have become less liberal since the 1970s, and that they often take cues from elected officials who are willing to compromise on moderate policies.\n\nChristopher Towler, an assistant professor at Sacramento State who runs the Black Voter Project, a public-opinion-survey outfit, agrees. His research has found that black voters are most enthusiastic about candidates whose messages are framed by racial progressivism. \"African Americans prioritize their racial identity more often than not, especially when it comes to politics,\" he told me. And that's particularly true of older black voters, \"because everything that has been political in their lives has also been racial.\"\n\nWhen Representative Jim Clyburn, the House majority whip from South Carolina, endorsed Biden, he explicitly made that connection. Barack Obama's election is synonymous with racial progress, and Biden is inextricably linked to Barack Obama. \"Joe will build on President Obama's legacy,\" Clyburn said as he announced his endorsement. Obama remains the most popular Democrat in America, and several candidates- now including Sanders -have used his purported stamp of approval in ads as a way to gain support not only among black voters but among Democrats more broadly.\n\nBut Jackson's endorsement could have potentially served as a counterweight to Clyburn's, potentially blunting the beating in South Carolina and preventing the Biden wave on Super Tuesday. (A spokesperson for Jackson, Shelley Davis, told me that Jackson did not endorse sooner because he had been in active conversations with Elizabeth Warren, who departed the race after Super Tuesday. The Biden campaign, he said, did not contact Jackson seeking his support.)\n\nStill, even with Jackson's endorsement, a revolution was not what black voters were after this time around, Tate suggested. \"Had this been any other election without Donald Trump in the race, we would have seen a more earnest battle between the more progressive and moderate elements in the black electorate,\" she said. That may be why the most diverse field in history has been winnowed to two white men in their 70s.\n\nTrump is a powerful motivator, but he shouldn't be the only one, Lumumba said. \"I certainly agree that [Trump is] important, but I want it to be substantively different for people living in Mississippi,\" he told me. \"And just being focused on [Trump] does not serve that end.\"\n\nHe paraphrased a quote from the Princeton professor Ruha Benjamin: \"We can't just dismantle the world that we don't want to live in,\" he says. \"We have to be the most active participants in creating the world that we do.\" Sanders, Lumumba, and other progressives, much like Franklin D. Roosevelt and Martin Luther King Jr. before them, are convinced that means radical change.They just have to find a way to convince black voters, too.\n\nSanders's movement will outlast him. And its next leaders are unlikely to be elderly white men from Vermont. Lumumba is 36, old enough to run for president. And Sanders's most important and effective surrogate, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, will turn 35 in 2024. \"In order for us to win, we have to grow,\" she told 10,000 Sanders supporters in Michigan on Sunday. \"We must be inclusive. We must bring more people into this movement.''"

      "text": "Democrats Can't Rely on the Black Church Anymore\n\nThe path to winning the Black vote no longer runs through the church door.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nWhen Kamala Harris learned that Joe Biden was going to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race, she called her pastor to ask for prayer. Like many other African American Democrats, Harris is a member of a predominantly Black, social-justice-oriented church, and her pastor, Amos C. Brown, is a veteran of civil-rights campaigns.\n\nTraditionally, the route to winning the African American vote for Democratic politicians has run through Black churches that are very much like Brown's-that is, ecumenically minded congregations that preach the message of the \"beloved community\" and civil rights. The members of these churches are overwhelmingly loyal to the party of Jesse Jackson, Barack Obama, and Biden; 90 percent of Black Methodists , for instance, are Democrats.\n\nBut today, many of those churches are shrinking, and their members are aging. Brown himself is 83. For many younger African Americans, the Black Church no longer holds the place of importance that it did for their parents or grandparents. Fewer than one-third of Black Gen Zers and Millennials ever go to Black churches. The result is that the Democratic Party is losing a reliable way to reach Black voters.\n\nBlack Protestant churches are squeezed by two forces. One is secularization. Although African Americans are still more likely than whites to attend church, church-attendance rates are falling among younger Black people. Nearly half of Black Gen Zers and Millennials say they \"seldom or never\" attend church-which is true of only a quarter of African Americans from the Silent Generation and fewer than a third of Black Baby Boomers.\n\nRead: What really happens when Americans stop going to church\n\n\"For those who were part of the Baby Boom or Silent Generations, the Black Church was a semi-involuntary organization,\" Nichole Phillips, the director of the Black Church Studies Program at Emory University's Candler School of Theology, told me. Black people in the 1950s and '60s, she said, believed that nothing else could equal the Church as \"a refuge from racial animus and hostility\" and as a leader in \"political, religious, legal, educational, [and] social reform.\"\n\nYounger African Americans face a very different situation today. Although Phillips insists that the \"prophetic\" tradition of the Black Church still influences young people, she concedes that they also have a much wider array of options than their parents or grandparents did. \"The emergence of social media has become a distraction from what was once the 'primary' and often 'sole' site of Black authority and power: the Church,\" Phillips said. \"What attracts young people beyond church walls has their attention and therefore influences their choices-social, political, religious.\"\n\nThe evidence suggests that some Black people who have stopped attending church have also left the Democratic Party. A 2024 study by the University of Texas sociologist Jason E. Shelton found that only 43 percent of religiously unaffiliated African Americans are Democrats, which he notes is \"the lowest percentage for any religious classification in Black America.\"\n\nThis doesn't mean that the majority of Black \"nones\" have become Republicans. Nor have most abandoned religious faith. Data from a 2021 Pew survey suggest that the majority might fit into the category of \"spiritual but not religious,\" with some perhaps drawing on traditional African or Caribbean beliefs that they may have syncretized with Christian practices. Ninety percent of religiously unaffiliated Blacks believe in God or a higher power, 57 percent believe that \"evil spirits can cause problems,\" 54 percent pray at least a few times a month, and 36 percent believe in the efficacy of prayers to ancestors.\n\nBut regardless of their spiritual practices, their lack of participation in the Black Church means that many don't have Black Church members' access to Democratic Party networks and traditional commitment to the party. They are less likely than members of historically Black denominations to vote in presidential elections, and when they do vote, they are more likely to identify as independents whose votes cannot be taken for granted.\n\nBlack churches are also losing potential congregants to white or multiracial churches. Among Black Gen Zers and Millennials who do go to church, nearly half say they attend churches that are not predominantly Black. These churches tend to be evangelical congregations, often of the Pentecostal or charismatic variety that have provided Donald Trump with his strongest base of evangelical support . Many of these churches preach a theology of personal empowerment and use conservative rhetoric on abortion or sexuality.\n\nAt such multiracial megachurches, \"the pastor is essentially an entrepreneur,\" Paul Thompson, a history professor at North Greenville University whose research focuses on African American Christians, told me. \"Like attracts like.\" In these congregations, the pastor \"rarely addresses contemporary politics from the pulpit.\"\n\nThis is very different from the theology of African American Christianity, which has historically been grounded in the Exodus narrative: the story of Moses leading the people of Israel out of slavery in Egypt and directing them toward the promised land. From the beginning of the 19th century to the present, African American churches have cast this story as an assurance that God rescues the oppressed and brings freedom and deliverance to the marginalized. They have described their own communal struggle against racial injustice as a continuation of Exodus. And because they tend to see political action on behalf of civil rights and racial justice as an integral part of their Exodus theology, many Black churches have invited progressive Democratic politicians to deliver campaign messages from their pulpit.\n\nAfrican Americans who attend a nondenominational church or a congregation affiliated with a white evangelical denomination may be more likely to hear a sermon against abortion than to see a Democratic politician in the pulpit. Perhaps it's not surprising that they're also significantly less likely than members of historically Black denominations to identify with the Democratic Party. In the late 2010s, only 57 percent of Black nondenominational Christians and only 62 percent of Black members of predominantly white evangelical denominations identified as Democrats, according to data compiled by Shelton. \"We cannot rely on old assumptions about Blacks' beliefs about the role of government in presuming that most African Americans are politically liberal,\" Shelton wrote .\n\nMost Black Christians who leave the Democratic Party become independents, not full-fledged Republicans. Even when they are surrounded at church by white evangelicals who are enthusiastic Republican partisans, African Americans are still highly reluctant to support the GOP, according to Shelton's research. But even if they return to the Democratic Party at election time, they no longer view the Democratic Party as part of their political identity in the way that members of historically Black churches have for decades.\n\nHarris herself seems to sense that the religious changes among African Americans may have weakened the networks that connect them to the Democratic Party. Although she has spoken at Black Church events during her presidential campaign, she hasn't relied heavily on Black churches to rally younger Black voters, even though she attends church frequently.\n\nInstead, she depends on organizations including the Black Voters Matter Fund, the Black Power Voters Alliance, BlackPAC, the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, and the NAACP's nonpartisan Building Community Voice Fund. These groups help register new Black voters through door-to-door canvassing and use digital media and outreach events at historically Black colleges and universities in battleground states such as Georgia to mobilize voters and excite a Black Democratic base.\n\nRead: The American evangelical church is in crisis. There's only one way out.\n\nTrump, by contrast, is mobilizing conservative Black voters by speaking at Black-led nondenominational community churches, such as the 180 Church in Detroit , that tend to attract politically unaffiliated Black voters who might be open to the Republicans' campaign message. In addition, he has enlisted the support of Black rappers such as Sada Baby and recruited Black Republican politicians to help with outreach in the Black community. The historically Black denominations may be unreceptive to his message, but Trump is bypassing those churches to find other venues, both religious and secular, that might appeal to younger African American independents.\n\nWhether socially conservative Black churches outside the traditional Black denominations will be able to deliver enough Republican votes to offset the Democrats' door-to-door canvassing and campaign events on HBCU campuses or whether the election will instead be won primarily through digital-media events and celebrity endorsements remains to be seen. But neither side is taking any chances. Younger Black voters who are not members of historically Black denominations are not as loyal to either party as their parents and grandparents might have been-which means that the path to winning the Black vote no longer runs through the church door."

      "text": "Kamala Harris Knew What She Was Doing\n\nIn challenging Biden, the senator from California makes a play for the Democrats' most reliable voters.\n\nWhen Kamala Harris laid into Joe Biden in last night's debate, she knew what she was doing. In a speech earlier this month, the former vice president had reminisced about being able to work with die-hard segregationists when he was a young senator from Delaware. In sharply criticizing those remarks, and his past position against school busing, Harris was trying to convince the Democratic Party's most reliable voters-African Americans-that Biden isn't as strong on civil rights as many of them thought.\n\nIn early polls of the 2020 Democratic presidential field, Biden has held a strong lead among African American voters-an outcome that, to some, might seem surprising when two black senators, Harris and Cory Booker, are also running. While progressives on Twitter were appalled by Biden's speech, many in the Congressional Black Caucus downplayed the former vice president's comments or defended him outright. Nor did the dustup hurt Biden at the grassroots level, either. In a recent report from South Carolina, a key primary state where nearly two-thirds of Democratic-primary voters are black, CNN found that support for the former vice president was holding steady.\n\nThese are signs that the controversies that blow up on social media haven't changed the fundamental political calculations of African American voters-calculations whose savviness and complexity are only dimly understood and often entirely ignored by campaigns, political commentators, and the voting public alike. The historically large and diverse 2020 presidential field provides a unique opportunity to observe the process by which the black electorate settles on candidates.\n\nDavid A. Graham: 'My time is up. I'm sorry. '\n\nLike other voters, African Americans make judgments about a candidate's character and policy positions. Because descriptive representation matters, black voters do show more interest in black candidates-but historically, that hasn't always translated into electoral support in the end.\n\nThe long history of discrimination against African Americans, at the polls and elsewhere, has shaped voting behavior in more distinctive ways. Black voters have been highly pragmatic : They have typically favored candidates who are known quantities over fresh faces with shorter records, and in primary campaigns, have deliberated long and hard over who's most likely to win in the general election.\n\nAll of these factors help explain Harris's attack on Biden last night. Polls show that African Americans intensely disapprove of Donald Trump. Past experience suggests that they will support Biden-over Harris, Booker, or anyone else-if they conclude the former vice president is best equipped to beat the incumbent. And their support could well prove decisive. But Harris just made Biden's task harder.\n\nSince the 2016 election, the white working-class voters who broke for Donald Trump have been media darlings, the subjects of extensive reporting and analysis. But in a Democratic-primary campaign with a fractured field, the choices that black voters make are far more consequential-and receive far less attention.\n\nExit polls showing that more than 90 percent of black voters now support Democratic candidates in midterm and general elections fuel the myth of a monolithic black vote and conceal the diversity of opinion within the African American community. The partisan skew is easily explained. While 31 percent of African Americans identify as liberal, 42 percent identify as moderates, and 22 percent as conservative, nearly all of these voters have ascertained that the Republican Party is less interested in federal protections of civil rights than the Democratic Party. Indeed, African Americans' enduring quest for stability and certainty on civil rights helps explain a cautious voting pattern in primary races as well. When a candidate has had a long relationship with black America, the risk of any unpleasant surprises on civil-rights issues is lower.\n\nStill, other factors come into play. In the past seven presidential-primary campaigns without a Democratic incumbent, black voters analyzed the political landscape in quite different ways.\n\nRead: Kamala Harris seizes the moment. Again.\n\nIn 1984 and 1988, Jesse Jackson's presidential campaigns received 77 percent and 92 percent of the black vote, respectively, signaling that black voters were most interested in descriptive representation, believing that a candidate with firsthand experience of being black in America would prioritize a program of racial equality. As the civil-rights legend John Lewis more or less said at the time , these voters knew Jackson was unlikely to secure the party nomination. Yet, as the political scientist Katherine Tate has documented, they understood how a strong showing in the primaries would give him leverage to incorporate civil-rights and economic-security measures into the party platform-a strategy that bore some fruit. In subsequent campaigns, the assumption that black voters naturally will support black candidates proved inaccurate; this was clear from the largely overlooked presidential runs of former Senator Carol Moseley Braun and civil-rights advocate Al Sharpton in 2004.\n\nIn 1992, Bill Clinton emerged from the field and secured the nomination by winning black voters, particularly those clustered in the southern states. Crucial to his appeal was a cultural fluency that he could deploy as a native of the region. The approach wasn't as effective elsewhere in the country; black voters in New York, for example, gave just as much support to California Governor Jerry Brown.\n\nEight years later, Clinton was highly popular among African Americans, who overwhelmingly supported his vice president, Al Gore, a heavy favorite in the primaries. In 2004, black voters largely coalesced around John Kerry, who made the case that he was more electable and offered the best chance to unseat George W. Bush, who was deeply unpopular among African Americans. (John Edwards, a senator from North Carolina, still managed to split the black vote in a couple of southern states by making regional appeals.)\n\nIn 2008, black Democrats were notably slow to warm to the newcomer Barack Obama, who had to convince black voters that his historic presidential bid was viable before they would peel away from the establishment favorite, Hillary Clinton. In 2016, she performed admirably with black voters, though Bernie Sanders, with his more expansive policy agenda, was able to win the majority of those under 30.\n\nThis behavior isn't capriciousness run amok. It does reflect the interplay of a varied set of electoral preferences. In the five consecutive contested primaries since Jackson's heyday, black-voter choice wavered between choosing the culturally familiar candidate (Bill Clinton), the well-known establishment candidates (Gore, and Hillary Clinton in 2016), the candidate who stressed his electability (Kerry), and one candidate who is African American (Obama). Not coincidentally, the candidate that won the black vote in each of these primary campaigns also won the nomination. Which candidate won and why was the result of the black electorate's careful analysis of the political moment.\n\nRead: The confrontation that laid bare the Democratic Party's evolution\n\nSeeing the overwhelming margins for Democratic candidates in presidential elections, some commentators portray African Americans as blindly adhering to groupthink-in essence, as simply doing what they're told-as if they were incapable of making up their own minds. Yet there are good reasons why, even in Democratic presidential primary campaigns, large majorities of black voters do end up supporting the same candidate.\n\nPolitical solidarity is not an innate characteristic of black America; it is a survival tactic that adverse experience has reinforced time and time again. Chattel slavery and Jim Crow paid little mind to the specific talents, abilities, and aspirations of each black person. Simply being a member of the race was sufficient to be disenfranchised and oppressed. Black Americans have been made acutely aware that their individual fates are linked to the well-being of the whole group . As political scientists have documented , social norms in the community encourage African Americans to look out for one another and ostracize those who don't. During presidential campaigns, politics is a major topic in what the political scientist Melissa Harris-Perry has described as \"everyday talk\"- the lively conversations that occur in African American common spaces such as barbershops, salons, churches, neighborhoods, and now, black Twitter. After all this deliberation, African American voters typically end up backing the same candidate-which maximizes their electoral power.\n\nWhat does this mean for 2020? Like everyone else in the party, black Democrats are trying on candidates for size. Biden, who served eight years as Obama's vice president, benefits from being a known quantity. Polls suggest his pitch that he's the most electable of the bunch has been resonating. Then again, Harris and Booker have raised the most money from African Americans, suggesting that black political donors have been doing with their dollars what members of the broader black electorate haven't been ready to do with their votes. How long these trends hold up depends not just on the candidates' performance, but on the outcome of the millions of social interactions occurring each day within black America.\n\nLast night, Kamala Harris tried to steer those conversations in a new direction-and gave her own campaign an air of viability. It was a shrewd move because, when black Democrats finally settle on a candidate, they hasten the decision of the party as a whole."

      "text": "Can the Democratic Party Retain Its Hold on Black Voters?\n\nDecades of overwhelming support could be evaporating, as new generations of African Americans grapple with novel choices.\n\nIn 1988, the late Ed Brown, then-executive director of the Voter Education Project, watched as the Democratic Party ignored blacks' growing displeasure with Massachusetts Governor and Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis. The party assumed blacks had little choice but to support Dukakis since the only alternative would be to defect and vote Republican-an option ostensibly more unattractive than an inattentive Dukakis campaign. The party was wrong: Black voter turnout rate plummeted by nearly 5 percent, the second largest decline for this bloc ever observed.\n\nIn the lead up to the 1992 presidential election, Brown admonished an overconfident Democratic Party for again taking the black vote for granted. Lest its short memory fuel undue overconfidence, he famously reminded the party, \"The view is that blacks have nowhere else to go, but blacks always have somewhere to go-they can go fishing.\"\n\nAnd the intervening years have largely borne him out. African Americans overwhelmingly back Democratic candidates in presidential and congressional elections-averaging about 88 percent support since 1980. And polling from past elections has shown that blacks are more likely to stay home on Election Day than to switch their vote to Republican presidential candidates. The black electorate mostly votes for Democrats, or not at all. But that may finally be changing.\n\nThe most commonly cited explanation for this phenomenon is the \"black utility heuristic,\" a framework developed by University of Chicago professor Michael Dawson in 1994. More commonly referred to as linked fate, it's the sentiment among blacks that one's prospects are ultimately tied to the success of the race. In his seminal book Behind the Mule: Race and Class in African-American Politics , Dawson argues that because race has been the predominant factor in blacks' American experience, \"it was much more efficient for them to use the status of the group, both relative and absolute, as a proxy for individual utility.\" In more practical terms, black voters prioritize the well-being of the group over their individual interests, and consider what's best for the group as a whole because history has shown them that \"we are in this thing together.\"\n\nThe cohesiveness of young African Americans remains strong, and is the genesis of the increasing social-protest activity in response to issues like the Confederate battle flag in South Carolina and aggressive policing of black people nationwide. Yet after several years of surging voter participation rates by black young adults, their turnout fell by nearly 7 percent in 2012. Taken together, these may signal the erosion of linked fate's effect on political behavior, which would constitute a tectonic shift in how black voters are viewed.\n\nA reliance on heuristics is not unique to African Americans. Nearly every voter employs them to some extent. Tracking every nuance in each statute and every action of each elected official is an enormous investment of time and effort, so Americans tend to rely on heuristics, or shortcuts, that ease their decision-making process. What has set blacks apart is the magnitude and uniformity to which they utilized the racial heuristic in their political behavior, rising to a level not observed in any other voting bloc.\n\nFor that reason, linked fate is most evident when examining black voting behavior. The black electorate's decades-long, near-uniform support for the Democratic Party is an occurrence unparalleled by any other race, ethnicity, or gender demographic in the modern political landscape. As such, the most considered question about black voters in the opening overtures of the 2016 presidential election is whether they'll turn out to support Hillary Clinton or simply \"go fishing.\" Any prediction that a significant chunk of the electorate will vote for the Republican presidential nominee is deemed to be nothing more than an interesting exercise in impractical punditry. The allegiance typically occurs despite the demonstrable fact that blacks hold a variety of policy views and are not entirely aligned to the Democratic Party's platform-a reality best seen in direct-democracy referendums from California to North Carolina where blacks have been split, particularly on social issues.\n\nLinked fate, in a political context, suggests that black voters approach elections with one simple question: Which candidate is better for the African American population? The analysis begins at the most fundamental level by ascertaining which party or candidate is most likely to protect civil rights and support equal access to economic opportunity for blacks. Everything else is secondary. For example, a politician's stance on renewable energy, free market economics, abortion, immigration, national debt, and role of the military in regional conflicts all pale in comparison to basic considerations of liberty.\n\nAfrican Americans may ask themselves: Can we vote? Can we work? Can we prosper? Can we live? With game-changing statutes like the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of 1965 being signed into law by a Democratic president and routinely the target of Republican opposition, the Democratic candidate immediately emerges as the preferred candidate. A recent study also shows that when the candidate is black, the effects of descriptive representation raises the level of black voter participation and support even higher-an occurrence confirmed by historical black turnout rates in the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections.\n\nA competing view of linked fate is that black voters are not loyal to the party, but to each other at a deeper level than other races and ethnicities. A centuries-long history grounded in the shared experience of racial subjugation and discrimination produced a common bond among African Americans that leads them to view the world through the same prism. No matter how respectable and educated an African American was in the early 20th century, he or she was unlikely to be granted civil-rights protections until they were guaranteed for the whole race. The remnants of such views are still seen today, most prominently evinced in the Black Lives Matter movement. In short, there is no personal liberty without group liberty.\n\nThe uniform support of the Democratic Party may begin to erode in the post-Obama era. New research suggests that the political utility of linked fate has waned. Two recent papers- one from Harvard University and another from Harvard professor Jennifer Hochschild and Yale professor Vesla Weaver-argue that the impact of the linked-fate framework, now over 20 years old, on political views and participation has effectively been overcome by the influence of economic class on policy preferences.\n\nThe original conception of linked fate was crafted based on the behavior of black voters who lived through the Civil Rights Movement or were born shortly thereafter. There was more uniformity in the African American experience for the civil-rights era generations. But since then, three new generations of blacks have entered the electorate with a wider range of lived experiences and views than those of their parents and grandparents. Hochschild and Weaver found that income inequality among blacks today is higher than all other racial and ethnic groups, and that blacks with better economic well-being are much less likely to be victims of violent crime than those who are poor. This produces tangible stratifications in the African American experience that has ramifications in black political behavior. The authors also contend linked fate has taken on a form of social, not political, solidarity-and this may be welcome news to Republicans.\n\nWhile data shows that in 2012, black turnout increased overall, so did black support for the Republican nominee, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney. Black voters over 45 drove the increased turnout since youth turnout decreased-additional evidence of an emerging line of demarcation between generations and their actualization of linked fate. Further, in 2012, for the first time since 1980, a decrease in registered black Independents resulted in an increase in blacks identifying as Republican. The relationship between black voters and the Democratic Party therefore is primed for disruption, and a Republican candidate with the right message may begin it in earnest, provided he or she understands the intricacies of this latest evolution of linked fate.\n\nThe late civil-rights icon Julian Bond once said, \"I'm old enough to remember when the political parties competed for the votes of African Americans.\" For a number of reasons, those days were long gone. But they are due for a resurgence. A younger, diverse, more politically active black electorate is uninterested in having its voice muted by a blind adherence to a partisan loyalty established before its birth. It realizes that the best thing that can happen for African Americans politically is for politicians to actively court the black vote.\n\nWhereas linked fate in the latter part of the 20th century meant political solidarity with the Democratic Party, the 21st-century iteration requires political competition to prioritize black America's concerns. And much like those young people who marched to obtain passage of the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts, this new segment of the electorate will not simply bow out and go fishing-instead, they are willing to go to the mat."

      "text": "What Biden Owes Black Voters\n\nBlack voters helped save the president-elect's primary campaign and put him over the top in the general election. Now they want action.\n\nO n February 29, hundreds of Joe Biden supporters stood densely packed in the volleyball center at the University of South Carolina, and the room went silent as Brian Williams's voice blared through the loudspeakers. Polls had just closed in South Carolina, and MSNBC was ready to make a projection: Biden had won the state's Democratic primary.\n\nWhen Biden appeared onstage to speak, he knew what the victory meant: South Carolinians had saved his candidacy. \"We're back!\" Biden yelled. \"The state that launched Bill Clinton and Barack Obama to the presidency has now launched our campaign on the path to defeating Donald Trump.\" He was joined by his wife, Jill, but he also stood next to the powerful South Carolina Democrat whose endorsement had buoyed him in the state, House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn. \"To all of you here in South Carolina-and especially to Jim Clyburn, my friend-you lifted me and this campaign on your shoulders,\" Biden said. \"I will never forget what you have done for us.\" In a state where 56 percent of primary voters were Black, 61 percent of Black voters supported Biden. Three days later, on Super Tuesday, Biden won 10 states-with overwhelming support from Black voters. The Democratic nomination was his for the taking.\n\nOn November 7, as Biden basked in the results of a projected general-election victory and raved about the coalition his campaign had cobbled together, he again pointed to the voters who had propped him up. \"Especially for those moments when this campaign was at its lowest ebb,\" he said, before turning directly to the camera and pounding his fist into the lectern for emphasis, \"the African American community stood up again for me.\"\n\nRead: Why Biden won\n\nAmericans patiently (and impatiently) waited for days as election officials counted ballots in Wisconsin and Michigan, and they continue to wait as officials count ballots in Pennsylvania and Georgia. Hillary Clinton lost all of those states in 2016, some of them by fewer than 11,000 votes. Democrats were aware, going into this election, that they would need at least some combination of them to be competitive this year. \"All these battlegrounds went marginally to Donald Trump [four years ago], and we knew that defeating an incumbent president, even one as disastrous as Donald Trump, was going to be very hard,\" Maurice Mitchell, the national director of the Working Families Party, told me. The group began beefing up organizing efforts in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania shortly after Trump's election. A win for Democrats in 2020 would be marginal, \"so every vote is going to matter, and Black voters-in Milwaukee, in Atlanta, in Philly, in Detroit-are the voters that are going to decide it,\" Mitchell said.\n\nAs mail-in ballots were counted in heavily Black areas, and many of the battleground states began to flip to Biden, Mitchell's thought proved prescient. For Clyburn, the reason for Black turnout was simple: \"The Black vote this year responded to Trump as much as anything else,\" he told me. \"This guy shows nothing but disdain for Black people.\"\n\nOn one level, the portrait is simple. Biden won more votes in areas with high Black populations than Clinton did in 2016. Although votes are still being counted in Pennsylvania and Georgia, Biden holds 93 percent of the vote in Philadelphia wards that are more than 75 percent Black, and he has earned roughly a quarter of a million more votes than Clinton did in the Atlanta metro area, according to the Associated Press. But this narrative is complicated by the fact that cities such as Detroit are rapidly gentrifying and shedding residents (nearly 5,000 in Detroit in the past two years alone). Biden ultimately won 1,000 fewer votes in Detroit than Clinton did in 2016, but his significant gains in nearby towns and counties, such as Oakland County , which has trended blue in recent years, may partially explain why Biden won fewer Black votes in Detroit proper.\n\nThe activation of Black voters is also the result of years of work by activists. There has historically been a gap between the rhetoric around the importance of registering Black voters and the investment in moving Black voters to action, Nse Ufot, the executive director of the New Georgia Project, told me. The New Georgia Project, a nonprofit organization dedicated to registering nonwhite voters, was founded by Stacey Abrams in 2014 and has registered an estimated 500,000 voters since its inception. Particularly in places such as Georgia, Ufot said, party leaders have followed the conventional wisdom about who shows up to vote, and spent money on elections based on that. Abrams's 2018 gubernatorial campaign showed the flaw in that logic; her campaign betrayed the fact that investment in turning out Black voters could later potentially flip a state in the Deep South. \"Both the Confederacy and the civil-rights movement lay claim to Georgia's past. The question now is, who will write this story about Georgia's future, and will write a story about the South's future?\" Ufot said.\n\nThe Biden-campaign leaders actively sought to court Black voters throughout the race. They dispatched Magic Johnson to Detroit, Barack Obama to Philadelphia, and Spike Lee to Atlanta to speak explicitly to Black men. They listened to people such as Abrams on what the effects of reaching out to Black voters and registering new voters would be. And they highlighted aspects of their blueprint for America-such as funding for historically Black colleges and universities and boosting retirement savings-that would specifically affect Black Americans.\n\nNow that victory has been claimed, however, the president-elect will be expected to turn to action. Biden has typically leaned on moderate policies that have been piecemeal solutions to the problems Black Americans have faced-or policies, such as the 1994 crime bill, that have made life worse for Black citizens. On the campaign trail, he apologized for that bill and made significant leftward policy shifts. But now it's important that Biden follows through on most of the promises he made during the campaign, Mandela Barnes, Wisconsin's lieutenant governor, told me. Black voters I've spoken with throughout the year have consistently expressed the feeling that politicians care about them only when they want their vote, then forget about them after Election Day. Surprisingly, in a July survey of Black voters in battleground states from American University, more than 60 percent of Black voters said they believed that elected leaders looked out for their interests. \"He wasn't shy about things that he said during the campaign, but now it's about coming through,\" Barnes said.\n\nRead: The Democratic truce is over\n\nMoving ahead with his legislative agenda may come down to what happens in the Senate. Two runoff elections in Georgia will decide whether Democrats control the upper chamber. When I spoke with Ufot in the weeks leading up to the November 3 election, those were the races on her mind. \"The previous [Jon] Ossoff race was the most expensive congressional race in the history of American politics, and the stakes did not feel anywhere near as high as they do right now-particularly for Black voters where one out of every 1,000 Black people have died from COVID,\" she said. \"Our work really begins when the dust settles and we see who's going to be in January's runoff.\"\n\nClyburn was certain when I asked him whether Biden would continue to listen to Black people now that they've helped deliver him a win. \"Absolutely,\" he said. \"And not because we want him to do it, but because he wants to do it.\"\n\nWinding his thanks to Black Americans to a close on Saturday, Biden paused. \"You always have my back,\" he said, \"and I'll have yours.\" They will hold him to that."

      "text": "The Most Important Divide in American Politics Isn't Race\n\nThe polarization of place and the depolarization of race are the stories of the moment.\n\nUpdated on November 10, 2020 at 11:08 a.m. ET.\n\nT wo themes seem to define the 2020 election results we've seen so far-and also build on a decade or more of political developments: the depolarization of race and the polarization of place.\n\nDemocrats have historically won about 90 percent of the Black vote and more than 65 percent of the Latino vote. But initial returns suggest that Joe Biden might have lost ground with nonwhite voters.\n\nThe most obvious drift is happening among Latinos. In Florida, Biden underperformed in heavily Latino areas , especially Miami-Dade County, whose Cuban American population seems to have turned out for Donald Trump. Across the Southeast, majority-Latino precincts in Florida, Georgia, and North Carolina swung 11.5 points toward Republicans since 2016. In southern Texas, Trump surged in several heavily Latino counties in the Rio Grande Valley and won Zapata, the second-most-Latino county in the country, which hadn't voted for a Republican in 100 years . * Even in the Democratic fortress of Massachusetts, cities with the highest share of Latino voters saw the starkest shifts toward Trump, according to Rich Parr , the research director for the MassINC Polling Group.\n\nRead: What liberals don't understand about pro-Trump Latinos\n\nSome evidence suggests that Biden lost support among other minority groups as well. In North Carolina's Robeson County, where Native Americans account for a majority of voters and which Barack Obama won by 20 points in 2012, Biden lost by 40 points . In Detroit, where nearly 80 percent of the population is Black, Trump's support grew from its 2016 levels-albeit by only 5,000 votes . (Exit polls also found that Black and Latino men in particular inched toward Trump in 2020, but these surveys are unreliable.)\n\nThe slight but significant depolarization of race didn't happen out of nowhere. As the pollster David Shor told New York magazine in July, Black voters trended Republican in 2016, while Latino voters also moved right in some battleground states. \"In 2018, I think it's absolutely clear that, relative to the rest of the country, nonwhite voters trended Republican,\" he said. \"We're seeing this in 2020 polling, too. I think there's a lot of denial about this fact.\" After this election, the trend may be harder to deny.\n\nA caveat: The 2020 election data are still incomplete. Nonwhite voters still lean Democratic, and one shouldn't overstate the degree to which their shift at the margins is responsible for Trump's overall level of support. Finally, race is a messy and often-forced category. While it is sometimes useful to talk about a Latino electorate as distinct from, say, the Black vote, there is really no such thing as a singular Latino electorate, but rather a grab bag of Latino electorates , varying by geography, gender, generation, country of origin, and socioeconomic status.\n\nThe depolarization of race will make it harder for Democrats to count on demography as a glide path to a permanent majority. It should make them think hard about how a president they excoriate as a white supremacist somehow grew his support among nonwhite Americans. But in the long run, racial depolarization might be good for America. A lily-white Republican Party that relies on minority demonization as an engine for voter turnout is dangerous for a pluralist country. But a GOP that sees its path to victory winding through a diverse working class might be more likely to embrace worker-friendly policies that raise living standards for all Americans.\n\nE ven more than the depolarization of race, the polarization of place is a long-running trend. In the past 100 years, Democrats have gone from being the party of the farmland to a profoundly urban coalition. In 1916, Woodrow Wilson's support in rural America was higher than his support in urban counties. Exactly one century later, Hillary Clinton won nine in 10 of the nation's largest counties and took New York City, Boston, Denver, Atlanta, Philadelphia, and Chicago by more than 50 points. Now it looks like Biden won the election by running up the score in cities and pushing the inner suburbs left, even as Trump strengthened his grip on rural areas.\n\nAnnie Lowrey: Why the election wasn't a Biden landslide\n\nWisconsin offers a good illustration of place-based partisan evolution. The state has been decided by less than one percentage point four times in the past six elections, but the distribution of votes has changed immensely in that period. In 2000, Al Gore won the largest county, Milwaukee, by about 20 percentage points and eked out a 5,000-vote victory in rural areas such as Pepin County, the birthplace of the Little House on the Prairie author, Laura Ingalls Wilder. In white, wealthy suburban areas such as Waukesha, he got clobbered by more than 30 points. This year, Biden doubled Gore's margin in Milwaukee to 40 points and significantly narrowed the gap in Waukesha, while Trump cleaned up in Pepin. Thus, two Democrats separated by two decades won Wisconsin by less than 0.5 percent-Gore with a metro-rural coalition and Biden with a big metro surge that carried over into the white-collar suburbs.\n\nThis story is playing out across the country. The economist Jed Kolko calculated that, as of midday yesterday, large urban areas remained staunchly pro-Democrat as inner suburbs moved hard to the left. In the Northern Virginia suburb of Fairfax, just across the river from Washington, D.C., Biden won 70 percent of the votes in a county that George W. Bush carried in 2000. Meanwhile, Kolko found, Trump held on to a 40-point lead in rural America and carried low-density suburbs, such as Ocean, New Jersey, outside New York City. From coast to coast, inner suburbs are voting more like cities-that is, for Democrats-and outer suburbs are voting more like rural areas, for Republicans.\n\nDriving both the polarization of place and the depolarization of race is the diploma divide . Non-college-educated Latino and Black Americans are voting a little bit more like non-college-educated white Americans, and these groups are disproportionately concentrated in sparser suburbs and small towns that reliably vote Republican. Meanwhile, low-income, college-educated 20-somethings, many of whom live in urban areas, are voting more like rich, college-educated people who tend to live in the inner suburbs that are moving left.\n\nDemographics were never destiny. Density and diplomas form the most important divide in American politics. At least for now.\n\n* This article previously misstated that Zapata County is located in the Rio Grande Valley."

      "text": "THE HISTORIC CIVIL RIGHTS organization is using cloud technology to drive record turnout in key states.\n\nD a'Quan Love did not like the numbers he was seeing. It was July 2021, and Love, the executive director of the Virginia State Conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), was looking at data from a campaign designed to recruit volunteers to help turn out the Black vote in Virginia's general election in November. To be successful, the organization needed to enlist between 10,000 and 12,000 volunteers, but just five months before Election Day, the numbers were off track. What exactly was going on?\n\nIn years past, leaders at the NAACP would have had to wait weeks to figure out the answer while analysts worked to manually collect and crunch campaign data from a variety of sources. But the Virginia State Conference's recent move to a centralized, cloud-based data management system meant it could now see its campaign data all in one place and monitor automatic updates in real-time. Looking at the results of texts and phone calls to potential volunteers, Love and his team quickly determined the problem. \"We'd been using some of the same messaging from the Georgia special election, and it just was not resonating in Virginia,\" Love says. \"Had we not been able to look at that data on a weekly or daily basis, we probably would not have been able to see that trend until it was too late.\"\n\nWith that knowledge, Love and his team were able to swiftly retool their communication strategy. The volunteer numbers, as a result, started rising, and soon the organization sailed 33 percent past the upper end of its recruitment goal: 16,000 people signed up to help get out the vote in Virginia. For the NAACP, it was the kind of victory that it expects will be a common occurrence in the organization's new, modern approach to electoral organizing.\n\nGoing forward, the NAACP's electoral campaigns will look a lot like the one it conducted in Virginia. \"This is the most high-tech voter engagement and civic engagement program we've ever had,\" Love says. Just two years ago, such a campaign would have been unimaginable-the organization, founded in 1909, was still relying on fax machines and the postal system for some essential communications.\n\nS ince then, the NAACP has been steadily migrating its local chapters and branches to Salesforce.org's Nonprofit Cloud . Those efforts took on even greater urgency during the coronavirus pandemic, when social-distancing restrictions required organizers to move much of their work online. In the lead-up to the 2020 presidential election, the organization vastly increased its capacity to track the effectiveness of its email and social media messaging, store and analyze member data, and coordinate efforts between the national office and local chapters. Ultimately, the NAACP was able to recruit nearly 200,000 volunteers for its get-out-the-vote operation, a force strong enough to reach nearly 12 million registered Black voters. \"The pandemic forced our hand to use technology more robustly than we had previously. It was the push I think all organizations needed,\" says Trovon Williams, the NAACP's senior vice president of marketing and communications.\n\n\"In the middle of a program, we can turn on a dime and shift. Before this, we would have to wait sometimes weeks to get that data in a format that would allow us to actually aggregate it,\" Love says. \"Now, our data is driving the decisions-our decisions are not driving the data.\"\n\nThe Virginia election, Love knew, was a critical test of the organization's new tools and systems, and the stakes could not have been higher. Earlier this year, the NAACP helped pass the Virginia Voting Rights Act, a landmark piece of state legislation designed to protect and expand access to the ballot box. But to codify those voter protections into the state constitution through Senate Joint Resolution 272, the organization needed to ensure its support in the general assembly and in the governor's mansion. \"It really is all up for grabs, and it could go backward within a millisecond,\" Love says. \"While the NAACP is nonpartisan, we're not blind. We know that in order for our agenda to move forward, we need allies.\"\n\nFor the NAACP, the key to victory for allies of voting rights was the mobilization of Black voters. And while those voters turned out in high numbers in the 2017 election, the NAACP wanted turnout to be even greater in 2021-ideally, in the ballpark of 430,000 registered Black voters. The best way to reach that target, NAACP leadership knew, was through a program that would get Black volunteers talking to as many other Black voters throughout the state as possible-a tactic the organization calls \"indirect relational voter turnout.\"\n\nIn elections past, that program was largely managed through the mail, which made it difficult to measure results and make modifications. But for the 2021 election in Virginia, the NAACP's digital team had the technology it needed to track the program's progress in real-time and quickly make adjustments, such as changing the volunteer outreach script or sending an additional list of voters to volunteers. \"In the middle of a program, we can turn on a dime and shift. Before this, we would have to wait sometimes weeks to get that data in a format that would allow us to actually aggregate it,\" Love says. \"Now, our data is driving the decisions-our decisions are not driving the data.\"\n\n\"If we go into 2022 with that kind of data analysis across, say, 13 battleground states, where there is significant Black population, we have the opportunity to make a difference in people's lives.\"\n\nR esults from the November 2 election in Virginia won't be matched back to the voter rolls until 2022. But, according to Williams, early signs indicate an increase in Black voter turnout in several key districts that the NAACP targeted, and the organization \"feels good about where Black voter turnout has materialized.\"\n\nStill, major challenges lie ahead for the organization. The 2022 midterm elections are approaching at a time when many states are passing restrictive voter laws and federal legislation to protect the vote is stalled in Congress. \"We need to see real reforms to protect the rights of people of color and working people in this country,\" says Dominik Whitehead, NAACP's vice president of campaigns. \"We're going to use this moment to organize those communities and say, 'This is more of a reason why you should vote.'\"\n\nM idterms are typically low-turnout races, which means that the NAACP will need to do more heavy lifting-and, crucially, more data crunching-to reverse the trend. \"If we go into 2022 with that kind of data analysis across, say, 13 battleground states, where there is a significant Black population, we have the opportunity to make a difference in people's lives,\" says Al Yates, a consultant with the data firm GSSA, which advises the NAACP.\n\nThat's a tall task for the organization. Love is confident that the NAACP now has the tools it needs to do some of its most effective work yet, powered by technology that would likely be all but unfathomable to his predecessors. \"We have the ability to reach out to these voters where they are and get them to the polls. That is what we've done at the NAACP since February 12, 1909,\" he says. \"Now we are maximizing that power.\"\n\nThis film is part of Our Own Hands , a partnership between Salesforce.org and The Atlantic's in-house creative studio, Atlantic Re:think, illuminating stories of Black individuals, organizations, and communities committed to solving systemic problems, one win at a time.\n\nInheritance is a multiyear journalism project that endeavors to fill the blank pages of Black history: to piece together, through reporting and data, the crucial events and conversations that have been left out of America's narrative.

      "text": "In the Georgia Governor's Race, the Game Is Black Votes\n\nThe Republican candidate and Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp denies charges that he is attempting to suppress African American turnout for political advantage-but advocates say barriers to the ballot help his cause all the same.\n\nIn the 2018 midterm elections in Georgia, the math is simple. If turnout among black voters is low-somewhere near 2014's midterm mark of 41 percent-the Republican gubernatorial candidate and Georgia Secretary of State Brian Kemp will probably win. If black turnout is high, and registrations among eligible black voters are solid, the Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams will probably win. All of the traditional campaign goals in a southern state, such as fundraising, figuring out how to build multiracial and cross-class coalitions, and identifying the policies that resonate with a broad range of voters, still matter. But when it really comes down to it, the game is black votes.\n\nThat means, then, that much of the game could be diminishing the black vote. Given the state's huge population of black residents, voter suppression is historically a pillar of Georgian politics. From the days of Jim Crow violence and the all-white primary and on, strong black political participation and turnout have been more aspirational than they are reality, and plans to decrease black electoral strength have long existed alongside policies and organizing designed to boost it. And this week, the revelation that tens of thousands of black voters could potentially be disenfranchised just weeks before the election between Kemp and Abrams has brought the old game back into the spotlight.\n\nTuesday, on the deadline for registering for the upcoming election, the Associated Press reported that over 53,000 voter applications are currently on hold in Kemp's office. The source of those holds is a policy instituted by the Georgia state legislature called \"exact match,\" a verification process that requires voter information to be identical to information kept on file either at state drivers'-license offices or the Social Security Administration. Typos, clerical errors, or missing accents or punctuation in names all became grounds for elections officials to challenge voter-registration applications. Challenged applicants have 26 months to remedy their situation by showing a government-issued photo identification to elections officials, but many of those whose applications have been placed on hold say they were never informed about the holdup, and many could see-or could have seen-deadlines come and go, and could be deleted from the voter system altogether without knowing.\n\nAccording to Danielle Lang, a legal counsel for the nonprofit voting-rights organization Campaign Legal Center, the thousands of people whose registrations are languishing can still vote in person in November, since producing the state-issued government identification that qualifies for Georgia's strict voter-ID law also counts for clarifying the discrepancy. But other voters might not be so lucky. \"Where it causes serious problems in the 2018 election are twofold,\" Lang told me. It's unclear if everyone planning to vote by mail will be able to do so and have their vote counted, since mail-in voters can produce household bills, copies of birth certificates, and other forms of non-photo identification that won't get them around the \"exact match\" firewall. The other problems are for recently naturalized citizens who are erroneously flagged as noncitizens in the drivers'-license database. For all these voters, they very well could cast ballots in November that don't even count-and they might never know.\n\nOn Thursday, the Campaign Legal Center, along with a coalition of civil-rights and voting-rights groups in Georgia, filed a lawsuit seeking an injunction against Kemp and his office that would make all people on the pending list or who have been purged under the rule since November 2016 eligible to vote in the upcoming election. The lawsuit also documented racial disparities in the application of the exact-match protocol. \"Approximately 80.15% of those pending applications were submitted by African-American, Latino and Asian-American applicants,\" the plaintiffs wrote.\n\nKemp, whose office hasn't yet responded to calls for comment, blames this preponderance of black purged names on sloppy paperwork submitted by the New Georgia Project, a group founded by Abrams in 2013 to increase the number of black registered voters in the state. Kemp has long criticized the group and its methods, and his own office and the nonprofit have been locked in a feud- complete with multiple lawsuits -for a half decade now. Kemp sued the organization in 2014, alleging that it had committed voter fraud and wasted taxpayer funds in a high-wire quest to register 800,000 new black voters. The lawsuit found no wrongdoing, but it has shaped the contours of a years-long battle over the electorate between Kemp's and Abrams's camps-and between a vision seeking to maximize black registrations and turnout and one that has proven deeply resistant to those efforts in the name of fighting and preventing fraud.\n\nIn the home stretch of the election, Abrams's campaign tells me that they have a tight focus on the mobilization of infrequent voters-not necessarily on the injection of new voters onto rolls that the New Georgia Project attempted, or that \"exact match\" puts at risk. But the campaign did issue a press release on Thursday denouncing Kemp, calling out the \"exact match\" policy, and calling on him to resign from his position as secretary of state so as to eliminate any potential conflicts of interest. \"As he has done for years,\" the press release reads, \"Brian Kemp is maliciously wielding the power of his office to suppress the vote for political gain and silence the voices of thousands of eligible voters-the majority of them people of color.\"\n\nIn the grand scheme of things, the number of people potentially stymied by the exact-match policy is relatively small-although the razor-thin margins of current polls and the potential election results make any potential advantage a significant one. But there's more in play than just the one policy. In fact, \"exact match\" has often been conflated with other voter-purge schemes that work in the opposite direction, moving already registered voters off the rolls because of discrepancies. While removing ineligible names from rolls is important for keeping them accurate and secure, studies of purges have found that they often uniquely disadvantage black voters, infrequent voters, and those who move often.\n\n\"There are two issues compounding each other,\" says Myrna Pérez, a deputy director at the Brennan Center for Justice. \"The first is just a massive number of voters are being purged, period.\" In a brief released earlier this month , the Brennan Center found that between 2010, when Kemp began his tenure, and 2014, Georgia's purge rate increased from 6.7 to 10.7 percent. Since then, annual purge rates have held steady at about 10 percent of all registrations.\n\nThe spike in purges has come not only during Kemp's tenure, but after the landmark 2013 Supreme Court decision in Shelby County v. Holder , which defanged federal enforcement of the Voting Rights Act and essentially ended federal proactive restrictions on state and local voting policies that were intended to be discriminatory or that disproportionately disenfranchised citizens of color. According to the Brennan Center, \"Georgia purged twice as many voters-1.5 million-between the 2012 and 2016 elections as it did between 2008 and 2012.\"\n\nAccording to Pérez, the effects of mass voter purging not only remove eligible voters and make it harder to vote, but can also counter education and mobilization efforts designed specifically to capture black voters. \"In my mind, the real disenfranchisement comes before people even get on the rolls,\" Pérez told me. Voter rolls are a baseline set of data for persuasion campaigns for likely voters and for \"get out the vote\" campaigns that target registered voters and get them to turn out. \"There's some amount of evidence that those kinds of outreach do encourage people to turn out,\" Pérez said. \"If you're not actually on the rolls you don't get that kind of engagement. So you have people who are not being engaged in that kind of way because they are being blocked.\"\n\nAll of the issues with purges and with specific barriers to black turnout rest on a foundation where voting is just plain more difficult for black and poor communities in Georgia. The state is home to one of the oldest voter-ID laws in the country, a strict policy that requires voters to show government-issued photo identification in order to vote. Georgia also erects significant logistical barriers to turnout in rural black communities, where transportation is tenuous and polling places are difficult to get to.\n\nAt the center of it all is Kemp, who is both the architect of Georgia's voting restrictions and the primary beneficiary of those restrictions. In 2016, during the precursor to this round of \"exact match\" hysteria, Kemp implemented a similar policy that invalidated registrations of tens of thousands of Georgians. Civil-rights groups successfully sued to block the administrative policy, but in 2017 the Georgia state House voted to make \"exact match\" law . Now, Kemp has the authority in the state to pursue aggressive voter purges, to deny people from the rolls, and to enforce a set of election laws that appear in some ways designed to limit black turnout. And now he is tasked with helming those systems in an election in which he is a participant, and in which-numerically-it's in his best electoral interest to wield those systems to their furthest extent in decreasing the number of black voters.\n\nAgain, the math in Georgia is simple. The math has always been simple. In a state where black voters make up a third of the electorate, and form easily the largest cohesive group of voters, it seems clear why so many structures that disenfranchise those voters have arisen over the years. Beyond the candidates, what's at stake in every election is power. And like in all other southern states, if black voters manage to turn out in high rates against the odds, the axis of power is due to shift, in a major way. The game is the game."

      "text": "Russian Trolls and the Trump Campaign Both Tried to Depress Black Turnout\n\nTwo new reports released by the Senate Intelligence Committee underscore how much the Internet Research Agency targeted African Americans-echoing efforts by the campaign.\n\nPerhaps the most striking takeaway from a pair of new reports released by the Senate Intelligence Committee is the consistency and persistence with which Russian trolls sought to depress the black vote in the 2016 election.\n\nThat workers for the Internet Research Agency-a \"troll farm\" with close ties to the Kremlin-targeted African Americans has been clear for more than a year, emerging in a series of reports in fall 2017, and then receiving new attention in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's February 2018 indictment of the IRA and several associated individuals.\n\nBut the two reports, commissioned from Oxford University's Computational Propaganda Project and New Knowledge , provide an overwhelming amount of detail and information. There's a remarkable amount of crossover between the Russians' tactics and what the Donald Trump campaign said it was doing late in the 2016 race.\n\nRead: Trump's 'voter suppression operation' targets black voters\n\nAccording to the Oxford team, African Americans were the single group targeted most heavily by the IRA-and it wasn't even a close margin.\n\n\"Messaging to African Americans sought to divert their political energy away from established political institutions by preying on anger with structural inequalities faced by African Americans,\" the report states. \"These campaigns pushed a message that the best way to advance the cause of the African American community was to boycott the election and focus on other issues instead.\"\n\nMany of these messages were explicit, talking at length about how not voting was the right step, and attacking Hillary Clinton for past statements, such as a 1990s comment about \" superpredators .\"\n\nThe New Knowledge report concurs, noting that \"the most prolific IRA efforts on Facebook and Instagram specifically targeted black American communities.\" A sprawling visualization in the report shows the extent and interlinkage between various parts of the push-the graphic is such a mess of spaghetti ties that it's almost impossible to track individual connections, which seems like the point. New Knowledge, too, highlights the extensive voter-suppression efforts.\n\nPersuading African Americans to stay home was a staple of the Trump campaign's approach, too. Barack Obama had twice won the presidency by motivating black turnout. Trump's path to victory hinged on getting as many white voters to come out as possible while hoping the Obama coalition stayed home-or persuading them to do so.\n\nTrump enacted a crude version of this from the stump, attacking Clinton and Democrats for their treatment of black voters, but making only peremptory, sloppy attempts at outreach (\"What the hell do you have to lose?\"), while continually treating minorities as an other . Meanwhile, his campaign was conducting a more elaborate version electronically , as Businessweek reported in late October 2016:\n\nInstead of expanding the electorate, [the campaign chairman Steve] Bannon and his team are trying to shrink it. \"We have three major voter suppression operations under way,\" says a senior official. They're aimed at three groups Clinton needs to win overwhelmingly: idealistic white liberals, young women, and African Americans.\n\nThe reporters Joshua Green and Sasha Issenberg described an animation that a staffer had produced with cartoonish characters, reenacting Clinton's \"superpredator\" remark. As officials told them, this was part of the attempt to persuade black voters to stay home.\n\nAt the time of the story, this seemed amateurish to many observers-the Clinton campaign was believed to possess a fearsome data machine, while the Trump team was messing around with memes. Then came the election results, with Clinton's shocking loss. In retrospect, it's clear just how powerful this kind of lo-fi influence operation can be, even if it's impossible to calculate the specific impact it had on the election.\n\nThe new reports don't just show the scale of the Russian efforts-they also show how similar the content and techniques of the IRA and the Trump campaign were. Trump's critics have speculated about possible coordination between the Trump campaign and Russian trolls, but so far-despite the many Trump associates who had contacts with Russian officials , no evidence has appeared connecting the campaign to the IRA.\n\nRead: The history of Russian involvement in America's race wars\n\nIn fact, it's easy to imagine that the Russians were simply making informed choices based on what the Trump campaign was doing publicly. As any independent expenditure group can attest, being banned from communicating with a campaign doesn't even begin to prevent you from discerning that campaign's message and amplifying. Moreover, the Russians wouldn't have needed much originality to hit on exploiting racial divisions within America, because, as Julia Ioffe has written , that was a well-established Soviet tactic long before Trump or Facebook.\n\nBut the congruency of the Trump and Russian efforts is notable, even in the absence of any coordination, because the president continues to deny-contra most members of his own administration-that the Russians even intervened in the 2016 election at all, much less to aid him. His denials are incredible, in the literal sense of the word, but the new evidence of how closely Russian tactics mirrored his own makes the way Moscow tried to help elect Trump even clearer.\n\nThe help could have had a powerful influence on the election results, too. New Knowledge concludes that Russian operations were more successful in penetrating the black community than any other group that was targeted. And prior analyses have found that declining black turnout in key states that Trump narrowly won, such as Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, could have made the difference. Clinton would likely have struggled with black voters even without the IRA and the Trump campaign helping to depress turnout, but it turns out those memes weren't nearly as childish, or as low-tech, as they seemed."

Smith dissected why Donald Trump grew his support among Black voters, and they believe they found the answer: Trump represented how white people felt about Black people.\n\nThe HBO comedian and ESPN star sat down together for Maher's Club Random podcast, where they analyzed why Black people could vote for a man who repeatedly expressed racist language. Maher offered a suggestion, claiming that while Black voters knew Trump was racist, the language he uses wasn't foreign to them.\n\nI think Black people think about Trump, like, is he a racist? Yeah,\" Maher said. \"But they think every white person is kind of a racist. Like, and do they think that white people behind closed doors talk like Trump?

      "text": "Fox News Star: Black People Will Vote for Trump Because 'They Love Sneakers'\n\nSenior Media Reporter\n\nLeaning especially hard into well-worn racial stereotypes, Fox News pundit Raymond Arroyo this week insisted Black Americans will support Donald Trump in this presidential election because \"they love sneakers.\"\n\nOver the weekend, the twice-impeached ex-president made a surprise appearance at Sneaker Con in Philadelphia, unveiling his new self-branded merchandise including the gold \"Never Surrender High Top Sneaker\" selling for $399.\n\nAfter the limited-edition MAGA shoes quickly sold out, Arroyo suggested Sunday on Fox's Big Weekend Show that Black voters will now abandon the Democratic Party and President Joe Biden because the former president is selling athletic footwear. (The segment went largely unnoticed until later this week when a clip from it went viral on social media.)\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAsserting that Trump's poll numbers have only seemed to improve amid his ever-increasing legal headaches, the most recent involving a $364 million judgment in a New York civil fraud case, Arroyo then contrasted that to Biden's sinking approval numbers among minorities.\n\n\"[Trump] somehow survives, which must drive his opponents crazy, because even the sneaker thing. I was on social media last night. Very interesting as you see Black support eroding from Joe Biden,\" the Fox News co-host declared based on tweets he read.\n\n\"This is connecting with Black America because they love sneakers!\" Arroyo added. \"They're into sneakers... this is a big deal, certainly in the inner city. So when you have Trump roll out his sneaker line, they're like, 'Wait a minute, this is cool!'\"\n\nTaking it several steps further, the conservative commentator-who has previously gotten into hot water with the Anti-Defamation League for peddling antisemitic tropes-continued to plainly argue that Black Americans will be easily swayed to MAGA because of their affinity for high-tops. \"He's reaching them on a level that defies and is above politics,\" Arroyo exclaimed. \"The culture always trumps politics, and Trump understands culture like no politician I've ever seen.\"\n\nRight-wing Fox News contributor Tomi Lahren wondered if the sneaker connection would translate into \"them going out and voting for Donald Trump,\" prompting Arroyo to declare: \"Anybody willing to put 400 bucks down for a pair of sneakers? Yeah, I think that's commitment and love. It's something, it's affection on some level. I don't think this is just for collectors. It's for people who want Donald Trump-brand sneakers that, again, he's connecting on a different level.\"\n\nWhile there is polling that suggests Trump could receive double-digit Black support in the upcoming election-the most a Republican candidate has received in generations-conservatives incorrectly believed Trump would pull in record Black American support in 2020.\n\nIn fact, days before the 2020 election, right-wing media ran wild with a survey from conservative polling firm Rasmussen that found nearly one-third of Black voters would vote for Trump. In the end, Biden won the Black vote 92 percent to Trump's 8 percent.\n\nSenior Media Reporter\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "More Black Men Went With Trump This Time. I Asked a Few of Them Why.\n\nThe number screamed at me and I actually wanted to yell back at The Washington Post exit poll, or, more specifically, those Minnesota Black male voters who comprised what, initially, looked like a glaring typo. In the state of George Floyd , which helped trigger yet another national awakening to the horror of police treatment of Blacks, 30 percent of Black male voters did the unthinkable. They voted for Donald Trump. It topped all the other states in the poll, with Nevada running second at 21 percent.\n\nI looked again, shaking my head. Then I rushed to google \"Black men in Minnesota.\"\n\nChris Fields, an office manager of a law firm in Minneapolis, is part of that apparent 30 percent. He applauds the figures in the exit poll as a good piece of news for Republicans amidst the long-shot hopes that the president might rescue this election from fraud. Yes, Fields, like many Trump supporters, believes there may be some validity to the president's claims of a stolen election, despite the mountain of credible sources and evidence that says otherwise.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn 2011, Fields, a native New Yorker, settled in the state after retiring as a major in the Marines where he served four tours of duty in Iraq. A year later, he challenged Keith Ellison for his House seat, knowing that the incumbent would prevail in an overwhelmingly Democratic district. Fields merely sought to start a broader conversation locally about the need for Black bipartisanship. Since then, he continued mounting that message throughout the state. In 2020, he steered the focus on converting young Black voters to Trumpism and, for the first time, found a receptive audience.\n\n\"My parents' generation would not hear of voting for a Republican,\" Fields told me. \"Younger generations, mine, my nephews, they are open to hearing a different message. They are more tolerant of listening to different ideas. If you see 50 Cent, Lil Wayne, Ice Cube, all those guys do is they give people permission, if you will, to say 'I'll rethink this.'\"\n\nOverall, Biden won 87 percent of the Black vote. However, Trump also increased his share of the Black vote in notable ways. Nationwide, Trump won 19 percent of the Black male vote, up from 13 percent in 2016, and 9 percent of the Black female vote, up from 3 percent four years ago, according to exit polls.\n\nThe rising Black support for Trump in Minnesota could signal growing Black impatience with the perceived failures of white liberalism to rectify racial inequities. Minnesota's entrenched liberal tradition runs deep. It was the one state-along with the District of Columbia-that Walter Mondale won against Ronald Reagan in the Republican landslide in 1984. However the dominance of the Democratic Party lives alongside the state's notorious Black-white gaps in income and education. In Minneapolis, the median Black income in 2018 was $38,000 against $87,000 for whites. This $47,000 gap between the two was one of the largest in the country-second only to Milwaukee. A 2019 Federal Reserve Bank of Minnesota study found the state had one of the worst achievement gaps between Black and white students when it comes to college readiness.\n\nEven Minnesotans who are not Trump fans and voted for Biden comprehend why there was a movement to Trump among some Blacks in the state. \"Let me be clear, there is hard evidence about the incredibly damaging set of policies that Donald Trump has catalyzed in this country,\" says Rose Brewer, a professor of Sociology and African American Studies at the University of Minnesota. \"That can't be rationalized away. However people make sense out of the world in the conditions that they are confronted with. And when you dig very deeply, you see that white liberalism has not been able to unearth the really institutionalized structures of racism here.\"\n\nThe racial disparities helped drive Cecily Davis, who voted for Obama in 2008, to the Republican side in 2012. \"We have to decide what part of this pie do I want and why am I not getting it,\" says Davis, who now chairs Minnesota's chapter of Blexit, the Republican social media campaign geared toward converting Black Democrats to the GOP. \"This causes you to lay down all of the emotion, and ask who's in leadership? Why are we not getting our slice of the pie, and who's in charge of that? That falls on the Democratic side and so it causes you to go to the other side to at least try something different.\"\n\nThabity Willis, director of Africana Studies at Carleton College in Northfield, says when Black voters leave the Democratic Party out of frustration, they enter the GOP with lower expectations. \"There are so many ways that the Democrats don't do what people imagine they should do,\" Willis says. \"Or at least what the establishment does. So in some ways, you can make an argument that people are more critical of the Democrats than they are of the Republicans because they have a higher expectation of the Democrats to begin with.\"\n\nWillis says when Democrats fail to meet the expectations of Black voters, the GOP is ripe as a refuge with an \"anti-status quo\" figure like Trump. \"Like white male Trump supporters,\" he says, \"some Black men might also find something attractive in Trump's anti intellectualism, which resonates with extreme forms of toxic masculinity.\"\n\nThe questions of how and why the minority of Black voters supporting a Republican presidential candidate grew in 2020 resonates beyond Minnesota. Is this just a fluke, or are the hopes of Fields and Davis unfolding into something that will threaten the Democratic lock on the Black vote? The answer to that may lie beyond Trump and be more about Biden and Harris. Will their pivots to broaden their appeals lead to sending the kinds of political gestures to whites or conservative Democrats in ways that alienates Blacks?\n\nVincent Hopkins, an entrepreneur who owns his own insurance and staffing businesses in Washington, D.C., sees Biden and Harris heading toward a \"please everybody\" route that will only produce failure. The result will continue, he believes, to erase some of the loneliness he feels being Black and an avid supporter of Trump and the GOP.\n\nHopkins actually has a lot in common with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. They were classmates at Howard University. Like Harris, he glows with excitement when describing the Howard experience. Yet Hopkins grew in a totally different direction from Harris at Howard, where his attachment to the Republican Party was born. It was then that he realized, he says, that he was the product of parents with conservative values that they abandoned in the voting booth. At Howard, he felt the freedom in the classrooms to argue with his professors that abortion is not just murder: \"It is killing Black babies.\"\n\nToday, he and his wife, Maria, a captain now serving in Iraq as a physician, have a 3-year-old son, Colin, named after General Powell. If they have a daughter, they plan to name her Condoleezza. He thinks many of his good friends suffer from Trump Derangement Syndrome. \"It means that no matter what Trump does, they hate him,\" says Hopkins. \"Even if he did something good, they hate him. There's nothing he can say or do that they would say good job or I agree with that. I mean it's almost a fanaticism.\"\n\nHopkins concedes he can't escape a tinge of pride in seeing his classmate, Harris, become vice president, but that feeling is far from enough to convert him. And, despite his strong support for Trump, he expects it will be easier for Republicans to make their case to Blacks with someone like Nikki Haley, one of his favorites, on the ticket in 2024.\n\nUnlike Hopkins, Mark Cameron, 54, who lives on the New Jersey shore and manages the service desk at an automobile dealership, is a registered Democrat and relative newcomer to voting for a Republican for president. He sees himself as an independent and moderate Democrat who voted for President Obama in both elections, \"not because he was a Democrat, not because he was Black, but because he was the best man for the job.\" He says that the same criteria-the best candidate running-led him to vote for Donald Trump in 2016 and again in 2020. \"I didn't think that he would be as eloquent and as classy as Barack Obama,\" says Cameron. \"He wasn't going to be a guy who I loved to hear speak. But I didn't vote for him for that. I've always been interested to see what would happen if we took the country out of the hands of a politician and put it in the hands of a businessman. Trump represented to me a possibility.\"\n\nCameron says he voted for Trump in 2020 to see him fulfill his agenda and because Biden and Harris were turnoffs. \"Though I'm a Democrat, I'm not really all that liberal. And quite frankly, there were some statements Biden made that I found a little surprising and could be interpreted as a little racist. He made an analogy about being in chains as an African American male in the United States today. I listened to the full statement and I know what he meant. But I still wouldn't expect any white guy to say that. Kind of turned me off. And then the statement about 'you're not Black if you don't vote for me.' That's not a statement that I would expect a white candidate to say when you're talking to the minority community. I almost feel, from my standpoint, that he's taken the Black vote for granted.\"\n\nBack in Minnesota, some Black voters clearly rejected the notion that Trump bore any responsibility for the discord after the murder of George Floyd by police. \"Policing is a local issue,\" Fields says. \"The Democrats have nationalized it as if Donald Trump can make a phone call and anything in that police department can change.\"\n\nFields even goes a step further and blames Democrats for the longevity of the careers of the officers responsible for Floyd's death, such as Derek Chauvin. \"The person who decided not to prosecute three of them was our own senator, Amy Klobuchar, when she was the Hennepin County District Attorney,\" Fields says. \"What I would say here is that the Democrats showed their true colors then and in allowing neighborhoods to be burned, and by allowing that precinct to be burned. They're not interested in protecting us.\"\n\nThe resistance to seeing the relationship between racism and Trumpism also appears to shape the perceptions of Trump supporters in Minnesota's large community of African immigrants. Minnesota has the largest Somalian community in the nation, in addition to more than 10,000 Ethiopian immigrants in the Minneapolis-St Paul area. While the exit polls did not differentiate between immigrants and native-born African Americans, both professors Brewer and Willis suspect that the Black immigrant population may play a role in the spike of Black voters for Trump. \"It is harder for them to understand institutional racism,\" says Professor Willis, \"And oftentimes they have consumed global media and the negative depictions of African Americans as well before coming here.  They have a distance with other Black and minority communities. To some degree, the gospel of the Republican center and right, the rugged individualism and bootstrapism, resonates with them because of their experience of picking up and transporting themselves here.\"\n\nAyano Jiru, a Trump-backing Ethiopian immigrant in Minneapolis, says he was the lone voter for Trump in 2016 among his family of 21, which includes his siblings, parents, cousins, and uncles. He has spent the last four years promoting Trump in his family and community. In the family group chat on election day this year, he discovered the results of his lobbying-16 of the 21 family members voted for Trump.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "George Clooney Doesn't Get to Decide if Joe Biden Runs. Black Voters Should\n\nDuring the 2020 presidential election cycle, it was the Black vote that catapulted then-candidate Joe Biden 's Democratic primary victory. With the influence of longtime congressman James E. Clyburn's endorsement in South Carolina, Black voters ensured that Biden would be the Democratic Party's nominee. With their steadfast support, Biden would run alongside Kamala Harris and help her make history as the first woman-and Black candidate-to become the nation's vice president.\n\nIn 2024, Biden must once again rely on this very consequential base of voters to help salvage his campaign. Only this time, it's no longer a primary up for grabs-but his own political party that's fraught with questions of whether or not he's mentally fit to lead for another four years. Everyone-from a growing coalition of Democratic elected officials to celebrity donors/supporters, such as superstar George Clooney and Netflix co-founder Reed Hastings-is asking Biden to step aside.\n\nBut so far, the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC) and its supporters are standing firm on Biden as the party's nominee-and essentially Black voters are as well.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDespite the ebb and flow of GOP increases among Black voters during the last presidential election, this influential demographic is the Democratic Party's most loyal base, with over 80 percent of its voters showing up for them in recent decades. Despite the historic obstacles and barriers that Black Americans have faced from leaders of both political parties, the Democratic Party has undoubtedly become the party of Black voters.\n\nSo when President Biden recently had a private meeting with CBC members asking for support-and he received such unyielding support from them-that means something. It sends a clear message that if the most loyal members of the Democratic Party aren't ready to give up on Biden, should others be so quick to do so either?\n\nWhen Biden recently described his dissenters as his party's \"elite,\" he wasn't mincing his words. Too often, the most privileged often feel entitled to cherry-pick its leaders and are often spared the vast consequences of whichever candidate is elected either way. In 2017, the celebrity and wealthy donors of Biden didn't face the same harsh realities that everyday Americans, especially those who are Black and brown, of a Trump administration. Sure, they might have been mortified by a Trump presidency, but they remained rich and connected in ways that others weren't.\n\nBlack voters are more pragmatic and practical in how they elect leaders. In 2020, they understood that an older, politically astute white man, such as Biden, was better equipped to take on a powerful incumbent like Donald Trump. Sexism and other biases had harmed Hillary Clinton's chances in 2016-but Biden was the safer (and arguably wiser) choice to pull off a Democratic victory in 2020. As a result, the logic often made about Biden supporters now is that he's the only one who has defeated Trump-and still can as the incumbent. Putting up a new candidate at the eleventh hour can create more problems than it solves.\n\nBlack voters are more risk-averse because they recognize that their livelihoods are the ones most likely to be under threat if things go wrong. It's easy for Clooney to write an op-ed for The New York Times telling Biden to drop out-but for Black voters who have backed him for years, not so much. Because new questions will emerge: Will the alternative be better or worse? And how much of a risk are they willing to take, given the current political climate?\n\nIt's already been suggested by several Black leaders that if the president were to respectfully drop out, Vice President Harris should be next in line to lead. Her involvement in the 2020 election helped motivate even more voters to the polls and raised millions for the Democratic Party. It's easier to see Black voters pivoting toward her than witnessing a brokered Democratic National Convention a few short months away from November.\n\nTime is of the essence. If one group of voters gets to determine the fate of Biden's re-election chances, it should be those people who can make or break the Democratic Party this election: Black voters.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Biden Must Fulfill His Promise to Protect the Black Vote\n\nThe failure of Democrats to pass a voting rights bill leaves state authorities as the last line of defense to protect fair elections-nowhere more so than in Georgia, where a special grand jury investigation may provide guidance on ways to blunt efforts to sabotage the Black vote.\n\nFor President Joe Biden to fulfill his promise to protect voting rights, the administration must commit resources to support initiatives at the state level. The most prominent initiative in the Peach State is the investigation by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis into the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe criminal probe centers on the phone call that then-President Donald Trump placed to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on Jan. 2, 2021, in which the president urged the state's top election official to \"find\" the 11,780 votes needed to overcome Biden's victory.\n\nWillis, in a January 2022 request to the Fulton County Superior Court to impanel a special grand jury, claimed to have received \"information indicating a reasonable probability that the State of Georgia's administration of elections in 2020, including the State's election of the President of the United States, was subject to possible criminal disruptions.\"\n\nShe wrote that other Georgia agencies with the power to investigate were contacted by the participants, including the secretary of state, the attorney general, and the United States Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia. As a result, she noted, her office is \"the sole agency with jurisdiction that is not a potential witness to conduct related to the matter.\"\n\nThe grand jury will convene in May to consider wrongdoings pertinent to state laws covering solicitation to commit election fraud, intentional interference with the performance of election duties, and conspiracy and racketeering. Willis plans to issue subpoenas in May, to gather a large amount of information in June and July, and to wrap up in spring 2023, if not sooner.\n\nThe Biden administration would be wise to support the work of this under-resourced county prosecutor, where possible. This includes helping to ensure that the inquiry proceeds without fear of intimidation or disruption. Willis recently asked for an FBI risk assessment after Trump used threatening rhetoric at a Texas rally that sparked concerns over security.\n\nShe has reportedly faced racial insults and threats as well. \"I get called an 'N' very regularly,\" she told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution . \"It's really silly to me that they believe that by hurling those kind of insults that it is going to impact the way we do our investigation.\"\n\nThe probe has the potential to discover facts beyond the scope of the presidential election as well. It could gather information on GOP schemes to use the state legislature to sabotage fair elections for Black Georgians going forward. Were there connections between Trump loyalists and the creation of the draconian election law known as S.B. 202 ?\n\nEven if the grand jury fails to uncover evidence sufficient for prosecution under existing state laws, it may find materials of value for state reforms and for the Election Threat Taskforce of the U.S. Department of Justice, among others. Created last July, the task force leads the Justice Department's mandate to \"address threats of violence against election workers, and to ensure that all election workers are permitted to do their jobs free from threats and intimidation.\"\n\nWhat is at stake is the integrity of the American political system: At what point do partisan party shenanigans rise to the level of election fraud or political corruption subject to prosecution?\n\nAccording to the Brennan Center , the GOP-controlled Georgia legislature enacted S.B. 202 in the wake of Trump's false claims about the election. It is a restrictive law that creates obstacles to fair elections by inserting partisan actors in the process. For example, it replaced the secretary of state on the State Election Board with a chairperson handpicked by the GOP-led legislature. It permits the board to dismiss local election officials and take control of the elections for flimsy reasons.\n\nFurthermore, it enables mass challenges to voter eligibility and punishes county election boards with sanctions for failing to respond to voter roll challenges. It requires voters to provide either an ID number or a photocopy of an ID document with a mail ballot application, shortens the time to apply for a mail ballot, restricts the use of mail ballot drop boxes, and criminalizes efforts to comfort people waiting in long lines such as passing out water.\n\nGeorgia is one of 19 states that passed laws restricting access to voting last year-the most in a decade. Of course, this is not the first time the country has faced problems with partisan designs of election procedures for political or personal gain. During the Progressive Era, reformers tried to find ways to thwart the practices of political syndicates at the turn of the 20th century.\n\nJournalist Lincoln Steffens, writing in The Shame of the Cities (published in 1904), sounded the alarm over practices that may seem familiar today-acts of election fraud, such as intimidation at the polls or improper vote counting, and political corruption,  such as graft and misuse of legislative positions to repress opponents. Reformers used investigations of powerful syndicates to tailor correctives, like the referendum petition and the recall of officials.\n\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported on the level of entrenched Trump loyalists in the state machinery.\n\nAmong these are David Shafer, Georgia Republican Party chairman, who allegedly helped to organize a scheme to send fake presidential electors to Washington to challenge the real 16 state electors. This event is under investigation by the U.S. House of Representatives select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attempted insurrection.\n\nThe committee has subpoenaed Shafer to learn more about the incident. It also has subpoenaed Shaw Still, the former finance chair of the Georgia GOP, to find out what he knows about the fake electors scheme. Still is now running for a seat on the Georgia Senate.\n\nThere is also Georgia Republican congressman Jody Hice, who shared false allegations of voting fraud and sided with a lawsuit to invalidate Georgia's presidential election results. He is challenging the incumbent, Raffensperger, to lead the office that oversees elections. And then there's former Sen. David Perdue, who also supported the lawsuit and called on Raffensperger to resign (Perdue is currently running for governor against the incumbent Gov. Brian Kemp).\n\nFinally, it was revealed in court documents that the secretary of state ignored credible information on the susceptibility of Georgia voting machines to hacking. A University of Michigan computer expert discovered a software flaw that could make the machines subject to hackers in the upcoming election.\n\nWith this much corruption at the local level, Biden must prioritize supporting efforts to protect the Black vote at the local level. Democrats need to understand that the inability to pass federal legislation has raised urgent questions within the Black community about their status in the Democratic coalition. What does it imply when defending the Senate filibuster is more important than defending voting rights?\n\nThe failure to pass legislation showed the Democratic Party to be an unreliable ally-and fostered interest in political alternatives. One is the project to establish Georgia as a Black safe haven state under the system of federalism, like the Mormon history in Utah .\n\nIn 1846, about 150 Mormon pioneers left Illinois to escape persecution. They traveled in 72 wagons under the direction of church president Brigham Young and followed the Oregon Trail in search of a land where they could establish a state of \"Zion.\" They found a site in the Salt Lake Valley in July, 1847-it was the unsettled common land of the Ute Indians and other tribal nations. By 1850, there were 11,380 Mormon settlers living in the newly created Utah Territory.\n\nWhile many people-and even some Black people-find the project of a Black majority state controversial, it holds appeal for some modern-day pioneers in light of the increasingly violent culture of Trumpism. The belief of national Democrats that appointing a few Black professionals to prominent offices will compensate for the lack of equal rights is wrong-headed. Such was the motivation for 19 families to forge the community called \"Freedom\" near Macon.\n\nGeorgia is arguably the state with the best prospect to become the new capital of Black America-and a reliable blue state in the deep South. That's due to critical factors like grassroots organizations, business ownership, mayors, county commissioners, district attorneys, state legislators, congressional representatives, and the first Black Georgian elected to the U.S. Senate, the Rev. Raphael Warnock .\n\nWarnock is up for reelection in November, and Stacey Abrams is expected to run for governor. They would be the first Black candidates to run for governor and senator for a major party in American history. (It is highly likely that a Black candidate will be the Democratic nominee for secretary of state as well.)\n\nIn addition, the steady flow of retirees, professionals, skilled workers, and university students contributes to the state's nearly 35 percent Black population; many are drawn to the depiction of middle-class life in the popular FX comedy-drama, Atlanta .\n\nSuch demographic trends are behind the desperate shenanigans of the state GOP. Nonetheless, there is more to achieving statewide power than a voting majority and fair elections. In recent years, for instance, GOP legislators have enacted laws meant to cripple emergent Democratic state leaders in North Carolina and Wisconsin-attempts largely reversed in the courts, but still of concern.\n\nAll of which returns to the importance of identifying local instruments to counter a reactionary state legislature.\n\nIn closing, the Biden administration must pay heed to the Georgia investigation. It has the potential to test the limits of local political offices to blunt efforts to sabotage elections. This is in the interest of the Democratic Party, the Black vote, and American democracy.\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "Black Voters Turn to Mike Bloomberg\n\nHours after this story was first published (with this opening paragraph reading \"There are signs that black support for Mike Bloomberg in 2020 could be a mirror image of white support for Trump in 2016, when voters who didn't want to admit their decision to pollsters nonetheless pulled the lever for him\"), Quinnipiac released a new poll showing that black voters are warming to his campaign. Bloomberg shot up 7 points to third overall in the new poll released Monday afternoon, just two points behind Biden, who dropped 7 points. And Bloomberg shot up to second among black voters at 22%, behind Biden at 27% and falling.\n\nThe headline here had asked, \"Are Black Voters Quietly Turning to Mike Bloomberg?\" The answer for many appears to be \"yes,\" and not so quietly.\n\nDespite a mayoralty defined by the billionaire's \"luxury product\" vision of the city that sanctioned stop-and-frisk dragnet policing of men of color , the evaporation of affordable housing, an explosion in the numbers of homeless people, and an exodus of working-class New Yorkers, I'm hearing daily from Democrats evaluating the current crop of candidates and concluding that Bloomberg is best situated to beat Trump and to run the country.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nI have spoken to three black NYC political operatives who are quietly thinking about joining the campaign, which is gaining momentum, hiring nationwide, and paying top dollar. These aren't mercenaries but self-defined pragmatic progressives who believe Bloomberg has the best chance at an electoral victory against Trump in November. I have spoken to a friend who says his black fraternity's message boards-full of college-educated black men of diverse financial backgrounds, in various professional sectors, living in towns and cities across the country-are full of favorable talk about Bloomberg. As I'm writing this on a trip to Los Angeles, I was surprised to hear my friends here-a diverse group of fortysomething progressives in different professions and from different backgrounds-saying not only that they thought Bloomberg could win but they were inclined to support him.\n\nThere's a reason Bloomberg launched his campaign by delivering a badly overdue apology at the Christian Cultural Center in East New York for the explosion of stop-and-frisk policing on his watch and at his behest-support for him is not seen as socially acceptable in many black circles, regardless of class. That one-time apology was meant to put a decade of black and Latino subjugation behind him but, since black women are the keepers of democracy and the Democratic Party, many pundits thought that the issue would keep him from really competing in the party's primary.\n\nWith Trump looming as the alternative, however, it's possible that Bloomberg is building a base of support that won't register in the polls until black voters turn out in large numbers to make a hard choice in South Carolina and then on Super Tuesday.\n\nBlack voters are strategic voters. As the great political scientist Charles V. Hamilton famously wrote, black voters often stay in a protectionist mode out of a keen sense of the limits to American democracy. Advancement is a risky proposition for a group of people who have only been voting under the full franchise of the law for a little over 50 years, and, as we know, even that is tenuous.\n\nCandidates like Bernie Sanders propose blowing up the ship, but it is black voters who built the ship, as wayward as it may be. Joe Biden presented a more moderate vision along with his association with Barack Obama, but his promise that he can beat Trump has been sorely tested by the struggles of his campaign so far. Other moderates, like Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, are viewed as out of touch by many black voters . Former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, an African-American success story and personal friend of Obama, entered the race awfully late and hasn't resonated yet with black voters, or anyone else.\n\nMeanwhile, Bloomberg has shot up to third place in the national polls after less than three months in the race, while outspending his opponents at a scale never before seen in American politics.\n\nWhile other Democrats are fighting in one early state at a time, Bloomberg has been using his fortune to advertise (and build a field operation) nationally. He spent $200 million in the last quarter of 2019, effectively lapping the spending of his competitors in the Democratic field combined over the full year-and that's just a taste of the spending to come in 2020. While other candidates need to spend time to raise money and carefully conserve the money they have, Bloomberg has effectively inexhaustible resources. Last October, Forbes estimated his fortune at $52 billion. Now, it's $61 billion. If he spent an additional $200 million every week between now and Election Day, he'd still have more than $52 billion left.\n\nAnyone who lived in NYC between 2001 and 2009 knows the power of Bloomberg flooding the airwaves and mailboxes. You couldn't escape him and his tailored and well-crafted messaging. He was a manager with a legitimate business success story, unlike the failed developer turned reality-TV star currently occupying the White House. As mayor, Bloomberg helped NYC ascend from the precarious post-9/11 financial era and ran an administration rarely touched by corruption or personal scandal-while also spending half a billion dollars on his campaigns, or nearly $100 a vote, and even that's not counting hundreds of millions more on personal and charitable giving that benefited him politically.\n\nWhile he was first elected as a Republican and his social policies were a mixed bag, at best, the level of organized elite black opposition to Bloomberg and his policies was almost nonexistent. It was an open secret that pastors and others were rewarded for their support or reticence.\n\nThat playbook is being used again now as Bloomberg has been racking up endorsements from prominent black mayors across the country, including rising star Mike Tubbs of Sacramento, former Philadelphia Mayor Mike Nutter, and Muriel Bowser of Washington, D.C.\n\nI don't think Bloomberg expects to win a majority of black women on Super Tuesday, but I know that he and his team have worked out the percentage needed (along with a plan for the endorsements from black women needed to persuade white Democrats about his viability) and will craft detailed messaging and spend whatever is needed to hit that number.\n\nFrom what I'm hearing this year, and have seen in past ones, I'd advise caution before betting against him.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "How We Could Have Stopped These Rigged, Racist Voting Maps\n\nFor the first time since the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act , Southern state lawmakers can once again redesign election districts without federal oversight.\n\nThat means several GOP-dominated legislatures can shape state and congressional voting maps without first seeking approval from the U.S. Department of Justice or the U.S. District Court of Washington, D.C. Without the constraints of oversight, seven Southern states are alleged to have established racially discriminatory election maps: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Texas, according to the Brennan Center )\" href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/redistricting-mid-cycle-assessment__;!!LsXw!WzubUtHDMgFO57dIYE-G6M9DJV87zmtqT9rrRyU_6UPqDMVJF0dLvpn2IyifN_iIt_bD_pSsT-K_DLMDhS1FnXzeLH995JZ5tA$\">Brennan Center , a public policy institute of New York University Law School.\n\nEach of these states devised maps that raise concerns over the fair representation of Black communities in the legislatures and Congress. The districts were conceived under a system of discriminatory mapping known as gerrymandering )\" href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/gerrymandering-explained__;!!LsXw!WzubUtHDMgFO57dIYE-G6M9DJV87zmtqT9rrRyU_6UPqDMVJF0dLvpn2IyifN_iIt_bD_pSsT-K_DLMDhS1FnXzeLH8RCnsTSQ$\">gerrymandering .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTo challenge the denial of fair representation , Black voters across the South-and pro-democracy allies-are fighting back in the courts.\n\nThe Voting Rights Act (VRA) was one of the signature achievements of the Civil Rights Movement. It codified into federal law the protection of Black voters in the South, and by extension, minority voters in other regions. The law was anchored in the 15th Amendment )\" href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/fifteenth-amendment__;!!LsXw!WzubUtHDMgFO57dIYE-G6M9DJV87zmtqT9rrRyU_6UPqDMVJF0dLvpn2IyifN_iIt_bD_pSsT-K_DLMDhS1FnXzeLH8ZlRYzFA$\">15th Amendment to the Constitution, ratified after the Civil War, which states: \"The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude.\"\n\nThe VRA )\" href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.history.com/topics/black-history/voting-rights-act__;!!LsXw!WzubUtHDMgFO57dIYE-G6M9DJV87zmtqT9rrRyU_6UPqDMVJF0dLvpn2IyifN_iIt_bD_pSsT-K_DLMDhS1FnXzeLH_s6SqUDA$\">VRA addressed the broad range of machinations used to suppress the Black vote under Jim Crow: poll taxes, white primaries, literacy tests, economic intimidation, beatings, and lynchings. For example, Section 2 of the law prohibits states and localities from devising qualifications or prior requirements that diminished the voting rights of minority communities; Section 5 required states with a history of discrimination to obtain federal \"preclearance\" before changing voter qualifications or districts.\n\nUnder the preclearance provision, Blacks were able to establish a foothold in local and county legislatures, and were on the verge of gaining statewide influence in the South. The law has been used to expand the political representation of marginalized groups through the establishment of majority-minority districts, minority-coalition districts, white cross-over districts, and districts with a reasonable degree of minority influence.\n\nIn recent years, however, VRA opponents found favor in the U.S. Supreme Court to prolong the old ways of white dominance.\n\nThe court in 2013 nullified Section 5 in a case known as Shelby County, Alabama v. Holder . The ruling released states from the obligation of preclearance.\n\nSince then, the GOP South has engaged in wide-ranging attacks on Black voter participation. Until now, though, the legislatures have not had the chance to redesign maps of representation.\n\nThis changed with the 2020 Census, the data used to reformulate state and congressional districts every 10 years. Each district holds approximately equal populations; if shaped adequately, they can further the goals of \"one person, one vote\" and enable the representation of common interests and locations.\n\nSuch is not the case in the aforementioned Southern states. The Brennan Center suggested that rigged maps in Texas, North Carolina, and Georgia alone could potentially deny Black voters influence in up to nine congressional seats than under the preclearance requirements.\n\nThat's because preclearance would have forestalled the dilution of Black representation through mechanisms such as \"packing,\" where minorities are concentrated in a few places with limited legislative presence; and \"cracking,\" where they are dispersed into many districts with little influence, according to \" Power on the Line(s) )\" href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.naacpldf.org/redistricting-report/__;!!LsXw!WzubUtHDMgFO57dIYE-G6M9DJV87zmtqT9rrRyU_6UPqDMVJF0dLvpn2IyifN_iIt_bD_pSsT-K_DLMDhS1FnXzeLH_piLmgkg$\">Power on the Line(s) : Making Redistricting Work for Us,\" a May 2021 report researched by the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund and other civil rights organizations.\n\nIt can take years, and tremendous efforts in the courts and on the streets, for communities to unwind the discriminatory effects of rigged election districts.\n\nTake North Carolina, where the GOP responded to the 2010 census by devising a map for the state legislature that packed Black communities into fewer districts than justified by the population growth, according to a lawsuit filed by Black state voters and described in the NAACP LDF report.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court in 2017 ruled that North Carolina's map was unconstitutional, but the victory came at an unacceptable cost. By the time of the SCOTUS ruling, the map had already been in place for years. During that period, the state GOP curtailed early voting, ended pre-registration for youths aged 16 and 17, eliminated same-day registration, and instituted a strict voter-ID requirement.\n\nFollowing the 2020 Census-in which North Carolina's population surge of almost a million residents earned the state a larger congressional apportionment -the GOP crafted maps that used packing and cracking schemes to dilute Black representation. Advocates successfully challenged the maps in the state courts )\" href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.npr.org/2022/02/05/1078481564/north-carolina-redistricting__;!!LsXw!WzubUtHDMgFO57dIYE-G6M9DJV87zmtqT9rrRyU_6UPqDMVJF0dLvpn2IyifN_iIt_bD_pSsT-K_DLMDhS1FnXzeLH8i_49EtA$\">state courts -and had the midterm primary elections delayed from March to May to litigate corrections.\n\nBlack voters in Alabama are also fighting back, contending in lawsuits that the state GOP failed to account for population growth in a new map for congressional districts. And most importantly for the representation of a Black community that comprises 27 percent of the electorate, a three-judge federal panel agreed with advocates that the Alabama GOP's map violates the VRA and should be corrected. However, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the ruling in a 5-4 decision )\" href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/comment-us-supreme-court-ruling-alabama-redistricting-case__;!!LsXw!WzubUtHDMgFO57dIYE-G6M9DJV87zmtqT9rrRyU_6UPqDMVJF0dLvpn2IyifN_iIt_bD_pSsT-K_DLMDhS1FnXzeLH8aBSwMZQ$\">5-4 decision , allowing the maps to remain in effect while the case is litigated in the lower courts.\n\nMeanwhile, in Georgia, voters are challenging the GOP-drawn maps for state and congressional districts. Causing notable controversy has been the packing of Black voters-and the cracking of other racial minority communities-in the suburban Atlanta congressional districts. (Blacks comprise about 35 percent of the Peach State population.) Advocates filed a lawsuit in federal court )\" href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.ajc.com/politics/judge-wrestles-with-voting-rights-and-chaos-in-georgia-redistricting/W4D5MGT6RFCPRF227UJVOVXZ3Q/__;!!LsXw!WzubUtHDMgFO57dIYE-G6M9DJV87zmtqT9rrRyU_6UPqDMVJF0dLvpn2IyifN_iIt_bD_pSsT-K_DLMDhS1FnXzeLH9GKv7G2w$\">lawsuit in federal court accusing the GOP legislature of diluting Black representation in Congress and in the state legislature.\n\nIt's hard to believe we're doing this again, but nearly six decades after President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, Black voters still must advocate for districts that represent their interests. As in the past, the usual arenas of appeal are state and federal courts, local and state legislatures, mayors and governors. By December 2021, about 28 lawsuits were filed in objection to new congressional maps on the grounds of race discrimination, according to the Brennan Center.\n\nAnd it all stems from the way that SCOTUS effectively neutered the VRA in 2013.\n\nCongress had an opportunity to address the denial of the vote and representation in January by passing the \"Freedom to Vote: John R. Lewis Act,\" a merging of two Democrat-sponsored voting rights bills, the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Act. But the bill died on the Senate floor .\n\nHad it passed, the law would have established new protections against racial discrimination in voting and election administration. The John Lewis Act alone would have rekindled provisions in the VRA weakened by the Supreme Court.\n\nHowever, there is still a chance for Congress to revisit the issue and get it right. That chance is the bipartisan talks over a prospective bill known as the \" Electoral Count Act ,\" which would reform how votes for president are verified by the Electoral College and certified by Congress-and to avoid a replay of the Jan. 6 insurrection chaos.\n\nStill, the ECA may be the last best hope to address the discrimination in voting unleashed by the Supreme Court. Democrats and moderate Republicans must incorporate into any proposed bill the key provisions of the John Lewis Act. It's time to end the racial chaos in our democratic system.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Donald Trump's Shady Bid to Divide Black Voters and Conquer the Dems\n\nIt's been proven time and again, painfully so in 2016 : the black vote will likely be the difference between a Democratic victory or defeat this November. This fact is not lost on the Trump 2020 campaign.\n\nWith a president whom an unprecedented 51 percent of voters believe is racist, there's no sign that black voters can be wooed by the Republicans , but winning those votes isn't and hasn't been the real goal.\n\nRather, Trump is trying, again, to both suppress and depress black voters while making gestures supposedly intended to appeal to them for the benefit of white voters.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn his Super Bowl ad , his State of the Union and his characteristically self-aggrandizing National Prayer Breakfast speech, Trump has taken pains to cast himself as a benevolent benefactor to the black community.\n\n\"Together, we are building the world's most prosperous and inclusive society,\" the president who ran for office pledging to ban Muslims from entering the country said without irony. \"We are lifting up citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed.\"\n\nThe message was implicit: How can I be racist? Look at all I've done for black people.\n\nMeanwhile, the few black Trump surrogates that still exist (Omarosa's tumultuous departure from the White House in late 2017 was a blow to their numbers) are hosting potentially illegal \"cash giveaways\" in predominantly black areas and his campaign has also launched a dubious black voter outreach operation complete with a call for #MAGA-inspired raps.\n\nThese efforts serve as a counterpoint to the consistent narrative emanating from the left, that this president is a racist and if you don't believe it, just listen to everything he says and does both in public and private.\n\nIt is true that many prominent Trump supporters, like David Duke , are proudly racist. But most Americans aren't comfortable admitting racial biases, even if they are willing to say their neighbors harbor them. So Trump's condescending overtures to black people have so far provided adequate cover for his supporters who are uncomfortable with how comfortable white supremacists are with this president.\n\nBack in 2016, Trump regularly appeared in front of overwhelmingly white audiences to make an explicit appeal to black voters. In those speeches, the reality show star painted a bleak portrait of black life in America:\n\n\"You're living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58 percent of your youth is unemployed-what the hell do you have to lose?\"\n\n\"We will make your streets safe so when you walk down the street, you don't get shot, which is happening now. That's what's happening now,\" he added at another event.\n\nThese assessments of the black experience were accepted and applauded by those crowds but the one time Trump has ever appeared in front of a truly diverse audience it fell very flat.\n\nIt came during a pit stop in Flint, Michigan where he tried to make political hay out of the water crisis there. The then-GOP nominee hoped to rub President Obama's nose in the debacle but he instead produced a meme-worthy moment when a black pastor cut him off mid rant .\n\nStill, his broad strokes caricatures of black communities have largely been forgotten or downplayed since Trump assumed office-for the most part.\n\nDespite regularly taking credit for low black unemployment and for a criminal justice bill he signed but never spearheaded , he has continued to denigrate predominantly black communities as if he has no responsibility for their welfare.\n\nTake Baltimore for instance, which he called \"rat and rodent infested\" and whose citizens are \"living in hell.\"\n\nMeanwhile, state sanctioned voter suppression as well as targeted cyber disinformation campaigns have proven very effective at convincing a significant number of black voters to stay home on Election Day. There is no doubt that Hillary Clinton underperformed with African-Americans in 2016 (was it misogyny or hot sauce-gate , who's to say?) but Russian bots promoting her use of the racist term \"super-predators\" amid the push for her husband's now reviled crime bill, did her no favors.\n\nThe attitude this time around appears to be \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" The Trump administration feels even more emboldened because they think they have a happy story to tell, even if like most white Americans, black Americans haven't seen a dramatic increase in wages or benefited in any significant way from his signature achievement: 2017's corporate friendly tax cut.\n\nAnd should Trump be re-elected, his goal of abolishing Obamacare once and for all would disproportionately impact communities of color , and his inaction or worse on crucial issues including climate change, gun violence and student debt won't be good for anyone.\n\nWhoever emerges from the already fraught Democratic primary fight will not only have an uphill battle connecting with black voters (all four front-runners have their deficiencies here) but they will also have to craft a credible and compelling alternative to the president's manipulative use of race to divide and conquer.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Biden Swings for the Fences-and Targets the Black Vote-With Last-Minute Ohio Visit\n\nPolitics Reporter\n\nCLEVELAND, Ohio-Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden visited this city on Election Eve at the behest of Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH) in a last-ditch effort to motivate enough base voters to show up against Donald Trump in the state the president won easily four years ago.\n\n\"When Sherrod tells me to come to Ohio the day before, I come,\" Biden said in Cleveland on Monday.\n\n\"Ohio, one more day.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe evening before the former vice president's arrival, campaign officials kept the substance of the event vague, only sharing that it was scheduled \"to encourage Ohioans to vote.\" But the fact that Biden was nudged to enter Cleveland, a city favorable to Democrats, indicates a desire within the party to appeal to Black voters in a state where their turnout could be decisive.\n\nOhio polls show a nail-biter between Biden and Trump. The two were actually in the city together for the first presidential debate-just before Trump was diagnosed with COVID-19. The current tightness prompted Biden's team to add a stop to his calendar while campaigning in neighboring Pennsylvania, widely viewed as a must-win for him, for the rest of the day.\n\n\"Ohio in 2008 and 2012, you placed your trust in me and Barack,\" Biden said, after sprinting on stage. \"In 2020, I'm asking you to trust me again. I'm proud of the coalition this campaign has built to welcome Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. I'm running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president.\"\n\nDemocratic activists and voters believe that Biden has a shot at restoring the state's traditional bellwether status in their favor. If they do, they'll have to overcome what critics have long described as an array of obstacles to voting, especially among communities of color. This year, that includes just one mail ballot dropbox per county, except in Cleveland's Cuyahoga County-which has two.\n\n\"He recognizes opportunity here in Ohio,\" Shontel Brown, the chairwoman of the Cuyahoga County Democratic Party, told The Daily Beast. \"People like to write off Ohio as red. We're more 'rigged' than 'red.'\"\n\n\"If you look at the numbers, we're more purple,\" Brown continued. \"Cleveland has the highest density of the Black vote, and it is critically evident in this election that our city could be a deciding factor for the presidency.\"\n\nElected officials and outside groups targeting Black voters have been working pre-election registration efforts particularly hard, a strategy in tandem with the Biden team's approach at the national level.\n\n\"There's been a lot of effort from the NAACP to get people registered to vote,\" said Danielle Sydnor, the head of the organization's Cleveland chapter. \"Collaborative efforts around voter registration and voter mobilization was up this election cycle. Activation at the polls was also created to deter voter suppression and people from leaving, which has made a huge difference.\"\n\nRep. Marcia Fudge (D-OH), a Biden endorser in Congress who the nominee said he spent time with ahead of his speech along with Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH), added that she was glad to see him make a last trip.\n\n\"We're glad Biden is here,\" she told The Daily Beast. \"We're going to win Ohio.\"\n\nTrump triumphed in the state during the last presidential election, capturing its 18 electoral votes far more easily than his other prizes like Wisconsin and Michigan. This year, the Biden campaign has been cautiously hoping to make inroads for months-Ohio was included as a possible place to \"win back\" in their public battleground strategy.\n\n\"I don't care how hard Donald Trump tries. There is nothing-nothing-that is going to stop the people of this nation from voting,\" Biden said.\n\nPolitics Reporter\n\nHanna.Trudo@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

A number of Black lawmakers have spoken at the RNC , including South Carolina Senator Tim Scott and North Carolina Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson. Lusane says that \"Donald Trump never has anything positive to say about the Black community,\" and that his effort to showcase diversity at the RNC is to \"gaslight the Black community.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, \"War, Peace and the Presidency: Breaking with Convention.\" I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nAs the Republican National Convention enters its third day, we look now at how Donald Trump is trying to increase his appeal with Black voters. During the first presidential debate, Donald Trump slammed President Biden for allowing migrants into the country, claiming they're taking, quote, \"Black jobs.\"\n\nDONALD TRUMP : The fact is that his big kill on the Black people is the millions of people that he's allowed to come in through the border. They're taking Black jobs now. And it could be 18, it could be 19, and even 20 million people. They're taking Black jobs, and they're taking Hispanic jobs. And you haven't seen it yet, but you're going to see something that's going to be the worst in our history.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're joined right now by Howard University political science professor Clarence Lusane. His latest book is titled Twenty Dollars and Change: Harriet Tubman and the Ongoing Fight for Racial Justice and Democracy , also author of The Black History of the White House . His piece in The Nation is headlined \"Don't Believe Trump When He Claims He's Not Racist: Trump does not deserve a single Black or Hispanic vote. Nada . None.\"\n\nProfessor Lusane, thanks for joining us again on Democracy Now! Can you talk about the point that he is making - we just had a long discussion about immigration - President Trump pitting Latinos, immigrants against African Americans in this country, and the significance of this?\n\nCLARENCE LUSANE : So, thank you for having me.\n\nSo, as your previous guest just pointed out, it's important to know that this idea of a replacement theory, that whites are being threatened by these cultural invaders, is something that the Donald Trump wing of the party has been using ever since Donald Trump stepped onto the national stage.\n\nThe article I wrote in The Nation was to point out that we don't have to memory hole what Donald Trump's history of racism has been, but, more importantly, also who has supported Donald Trump. Ever since he stepped onto the stage, every avowed racist in the country - Ku Klux Klaners, neo-Nazis, avowed fascists - have backed Donald Trump. And he's been able to get away with that kind of support, because in many ways the media has evaded questioning him about that.\n\nBut this has become the way in which the Republican Party in 2024, a party of grievance, extremism and racism, operates and functions. And so, it's really critical to not let this memory be lost of Donald Trump's policies and behavior over the last number of years, and how that has permeated the Republican Party.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : As you point out, in a recent interview in Time magazine, Trump suggested the problem was really anti-white racism. \"If you look right now, there's absolutely a bias against white [people] and that's a problem,\" Trump said. Your response, Professor Lusane?\n\nCLARENCE LUSANE : So, Trump again is leaning in to his base. And what the data is showing is that for at least the last 10 years or so, if not even before then, that a majority of whites, and particularly Republican voters, believe that racism in this country exists against white people, that Black people, that Latinos, that Asians basically do not have issues with institutional or systemic racism, but it's actually whites that are being targeted.\n\nAnd this isn't just kind of rhetoric. This is actually manifesting itself both in the Republican Party platform and Republican Party activists. Stephen Miller, for example, who your earlier guest referenced, heads up America First Legal. Its entire purpose is to go after what they argue are racism, racist attacks against whites. So, America First Legal has filed lawsuit after lawsuit after lawsuit against private sector entities that they claim are discriminating particularly against white males.\n\nAnd so, when Donald Trump says that anti-white racism is actually a thing, he is very serious that his second administration, if he comes to power, will operate on that. He has pledged, for example, that he will end every DEI - diversity, equity and inclusion - program that exists anywhere in the federal government. Now, that's not just talking about specific programs about diversity; that's talking about any effort in any branch of government to recognize that there needs to be inclusive hiring, there needs to be inclusive policies. So, this is a very real tactic on the part of Donald Trump.\n\nThe problem is that it actually conflicts with what they're trying to do and win Black voters. Donald Trump recognizes that in the swing states - in Georgia, in Michigan, in Pennsylvania, in Wisconsin, in all of these key battleground states - the Black vote has been extremely decisive in helping the Democrats. So, they have to figure out a way to either drive down the vote for the Democrats or, if possible, if they can win votes. But that's very difficult to do, given Donald Trump's record and history.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : On Monday, Democracy Now! 's Renée Feltz was on the floor of the convention. She spoke to a man wearing a large cowboy hat who was attending the RNC with members of the Florida delegation.\n\nLARRY WILCOXSON : Larry Wilcoxson, from Florida.\n\nRENÉE FELTZ : And are you here as part of the delegation?\n\nLARRY WILCOXSON : I'm just here.\n\nRENÉE FELTZ : All right. Can you say a little bit about why you're here?\n\nLARRY WILCOXSON : I'm here to support the president, Donald J. Trump. That's the only reason why I'll come here.\n\nRENÉE FELTZ : It sounded like he might have even been talking to people like you, his supporters, when he spoke about preserving Black jobs. Can you talk about, you know, what that might have meant to you? And what's the difference between Black jobs and other jobs, for example?\n\nLARRY WILCOXSON : See, I think a lot of stuff be taken out of context. And what he mean was just mid-level jobs. I mean, and that's just the truth, mid-level jobs as far as, like, trades. Those are mid-level jobs to me. And so, that's what he meant. And, yes, a lot of illegals are coming over here, a lot of migrants coming over here, and that's the jobs they're getting, because a lot of our own employees' employers, they're hiring those individuals for cheaper wages. And that's just the truth.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Your response, Professor Clarence Lusane?\n\nCLARENCE LUSANE : So, when Donald Trump refers to \"the Black people\" and he refers to \"Black jobs,\" what he said is that his view of where Black people fit in this country, in employment, in culture and otherwise, is always at the bottom. Donald Trump never has anything positive to say about the Black community. He never talks about Black doctors, for example, or Black engineers or Black accountants or Black people who are in many, many different professions up and down the spectrum of employment. He essentially sees, through racist-tinted eyes, Black people at the very, very bottom. And that's how he sees immigrants, or, to be more precise, immigrants of color. And so, that's the conflict that he's trying to pitch.\n\nBut what the data shows, of course, what the Department of Labor shows, is that in every single area of occupation, you have Black people, you have Latinos, you have Asians, kind of across the spectrum. And so, Donald Trump, though, feeds into this narrative among conservatives that there are categories of work for certain people, and that that is how he then seeds attacking immigrants and creating, again, this conflict between the Black community and the immigrant community.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : On Tuesday night, Democracy Now! 's Messiah Rhodes caught up with Forgiato Blow, a pro-Trump rapper, who debuted his video, \"Trump Trump Baby,\" featuring Amber Rose, at the RNC , a day after she spoke. This is what he said to Messiah.\n\nFORGIATO BLOW : I've been supporting Trump, like, die-hard since 2015. Before that, I was with Rick Ross, French Montana, a lot of big-name rappers, had a lot of big-name songs, so I was already very successful in that side of the industry, you know, grinding my way in.\n\nBut Donald Trump was like the boss. You know what I mean? He's getting money. He's a rapper's dream, you know? He's out here now dodging bullets, getting indictments. He's a real rapper.\n\nBut, you know, back in 2016, when he came in, it was just about proving people wrong. That's one thing I'm big on. Nobody believed that he would be the president. He knocked that door down, right?\n\nHe's very successful. He's made a lot of money. He's got the beautiful wife, nice cars. So, it was just, you know, being young, trying to chase that dream and be like Trump - you know what I'm saying? - and just have a positive role model to look up to. ...\n\nAnd even though at one time we didn't see eye to eye, I could bring you in. Amber Rose, she spoke yesterday. She's a model. She was big against Trump for years. I have a new video that just came out with her, a song called \"Trump Trump Baby.\" She's on the song. It's number eight on Billboard right now.\n\nBut the thing is, a lot of people don't realize, like, we need new voters. Right? So, when these people - like, you know, we're out here making all this content for Donald Trump and, you know, trying to sell Donald Trump on people, and they're not buying it, and then, when they finally buy it five years later, and we're like, \"Boo! You can't do it,\" that hurts us. We need to get the new voters. We need new voters and to get people equal opportunity.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Soon after they spoke, rapper Forgiato Blow and Amber Rose took the stage of the RNC .\n\nFORGIATO BLOW : Yeah, it's the mayor of Magaville, baby! Amber Rose! Hey, you know who we voting for! We voting Donald Trump, baby. Donald Trump, baby. America needs saving. America needs saving! We voting Trump, Trump, baby. Trump, Trump, baby. November 5th we going crazy. November 5th we going crazy!\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That's rapper Forgiato Blow and Amber Rose, \"Trump Trump Baby.\" Professor Clarence Lusane, your response to the appeal that President Trump is making right now and what rapper Forgiato Blow is saying?\n\nCLARENCE LUSANE : So, what we see with Forgiato Blow and Amber Rose, as well as the Black congressmembers, Republican congressmembers, that they're bringing on stage is this effort to basically gaslight the Black community on what really has been the Donald Trump record. And so, what we see is this argument that the Democrats have for decades created the circumstances under which Black people are living in the worst conditions possible, and that somehow Donald Trump will be able to overcome that, although there's literally no record of that.\n\nTim Scott, for example, who's the senator from South Carolina, gave a speech on Monday where he argued that racism - America is not a racist country, that, essentially, racial discrimination, systemic and institutional, don't exist. In fact, Tim Scott should look at his own state, South Carolina. South Carolina is one of the poorest states in the country, as are many of the states that are controlled by the Republican Party. In South Carolina, the governor is Republican. The two senators to the Congress are Republicans. Six out of the seven House members are Republican, James Clyburn being the exception. The state Legislature, controlled by Republicans. And what we see is this is a state where poverty is high, is above the national average. But then, when you break it down, about 9% to 10% of whites in the state fall under that poverty line, but almost 25%, almost a quarter, of Black people. How do you explain that? Tim Scott explains it by saying that, essentially, it's those people's fault. It has nothing to do with the policies of the state, has nothing to do with systemic racism.\n\nBut we're talking generations of ways in which people, again, across these Republican states have been mired in poverty, and, again, disproportionately racialized. And if you look at educational attainment, you look at access to healthcare, in all of these situations, racial disparities tend to manifest. But none of this is being addressed by the Tim Scotts, the Ben Carsons, the Amber Roses and the other people of color that they're putting on stage at the Republican convention, because those are inconvenient truths.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Clarence Lusane, I want to thank you for being with us, political science professor at Howard University, director of the International Affairs Program there.

We host a roundtable discussion on the results with Barbara Ransby, historian, author and activist; Rev. Dr. William Barber, co-chair of the Poor People's Campaign and president of Repairers of the Breach; and Elie Mystal, the justice correspondent for The Nation.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: We continue to look at Super Tuesday results, which established the fight for the Democratic nomination as largely a two-man race between Senator Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden. Biden swept the South and the Midwest last night, winning Virginia, North Carolina, Arkansas, Alabama, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Massachusetts, Minnesota and Texas, propelled by a huge majority of African-American votes in several states. And Sanders won in the West, with victories in Colorado and Utah and the grand prize of the night, California, with significant Latinx support. Sanders also won his home state of Vermont.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Biden's strong showing came after the Democratic Party establishment consolidated around the former vice president, with Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg dropping out in recent days and throwing their support behind him. But it also was due to black voters in the South, who supported Biden by extremely significant margins. NBC reports Biden won the support of 63% of black voters in Virginia, 62% of black voters in Tennessee and 72% of black voters in Alabama. Exit polls also show 6 in 10 black voters backed Biden in Texas and North Carolina. According to an NBC exit poll , black voters outside the South were less likely to support Biden, and Black voters under 45 are around three times as likely to support Bernie Sanders than older voters.\n\nWell, for more, we host a roundtable discussion. In Chicago, we're joined by Barbara Ransby, historian, author and activist. She's endorsed Bernie Sanders for the Democratic nomination. Her latest book is Making All Black Lives Matter: Reimagining Freedom in the 21st Century . Reverend Dr. William Barber is with us in Washington, D.C., co-chair of the Poor People's Campaign and president of Repairers of the Breach. And via Democracy Now! video stream, we're joined by Elie Mystal, The Nation 's justice correspondent and author of the magazine's new monthly column, \"Objection!\" His recent column is titled \"Black Voters Didn't Vote for Biden in South Carolina Because They 'Lack Information.'\"\n\nWelcome back to Democracy Now! , Elie. Elie, let us begin with you. Your response to what happened on Super Tuesday?\n\nELIE MYSTAL : I think it's pretty amazing how much the black community in the South, the older black community, has really rallied behind Joe Biden. They have been with Biden from the start, when it looked like he was shaky. It looked they might even go to Mike Bloomberg. But they've all come back to Biden. And it's provided him a firewall that I am surprised that Bernie Sanders hasn't yet been able to break through, right? He's had five years to work on this problem. This is what happened to him in 2016 against Hillary Clinton. And I think it deserves serious analysis to try to figure out why his message is not impacting that community, when he's had so long to work on it. I think your earlier guest, Chuck, he made a good point that Bernie seems to have made real inroads with the Latinx community. But that hasn't worked with the black community, hasn't worked with the Southern older black community specifically.\n\nAnd just to kind of cut people off at the pass, I think one thing that we can't say, one bad analysis that's out there, is that somehow Southern older blacks are just, \"oh, more conservative, and so that's why they...\" There is no evidence that Southern black voters are more socially conservative than other voters in this primary, when you look at the fact that all of the candidates running are basically in lockstep on the social issues, right? Like, all the candidates running support a woman's right to choose. All the candidates running support gay marriage. Like, all of the Democratic primary candidates are kind of in lockstep on the social issues. On the economic progressivism issues, again, black voters all across the country, including in the South, have a record of supporting economic progressivism. Right? The Poor People's Campaign that Reverend Barber is running. Like, there is strong African-American support all across the South for economic progressivism. So, what is it that's - what part of Bernie's message is not translating to Southern black voters, I think, is a really nuanced and interesting question.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, I'd like to bring Barbara Ransby into the discussion. And, Barbara Ransby, specifically, there is an existing superstructure of black elected officials across the country who for most of this campaign were sort of divided in their perspective, until, it seems to me, the South Carolina primary, especially the pronouncements of James - of Congressman Clyburn and his impact on the race in terms of - it appeared to consolidate the existing superstructure of black elected officials around the country to turn out the vote. I'm wondering your perspective of what happened last night.\n\nBARBARA RANSBY : Yeah. No, I think that's really a good point. But let me say this: The good news from last night was Bloomberg's defeat, in a sense. You know, the fear that Bloomberg could literally come in and buy black voters and other voters was a real fear. And so, even with all his millions of investment, he didn't have the showing that he expected. So I think that's the good news and one important takeaway.\n\nI think, in terms of black voters, you know, Ibram Kendi made the point last night in a tweet that we are talking about a subset of black voters. We are talking about older black voters. We're talking about primarily black voters in the South. And I think people vote for a lot of reasons. Most people are not reading every line of everyone's platform, and there's a lot of trust by association. So when Jim Clyburn comes in and gives his full weight behind Joe Biden, I think it did indeed have a ripple effect. I'm not saying that black voters in the South are not - you know, my relatives are in the South. I respect and have drawn wisdom from black folks in the South. My people come from the South. And my research is about the strength and fortitude and brilliant leadership of black Southerners in the Black Freedom Movement. So, absolutely no diss to black Southerners at all. But I think people are afraid, and I think our people voted more out of fear and pragmatism than out of hope and optimism. And we've got to turn that around.\n\nIf you look at a Joe Biden versus a Bernie Sanders, both very imperfect. I am not looking for a savior in this election. But clearly, down the line, looking at his past, looking at his platform and looking at what he represents for the future, including young black activists, who are excited about him, Bernie Sanders, hands down, is what black people need to be looking toward in terms of a campaign that can make a material impact on our lives and the lives of our people.\n\nSo, you know, I think the race is not over. I think that there are a number of states still to be won and are in play. And I also think we have to recalibrate our notion of winning. For me, electoral politics is one part of a larger effort to further the cause of black freedom and justice in this country, for black people, for all people, and certainly sustainability for the planet. So this is one part of a larger agenda, a larger effort, a larger movement building. I think that's one of the things I have appreciated about the Sanders campaign, people like Phil Agnew and Nina Turner and others in that campaign, who have a bigger vision of building a movement, not just winning an election - although, hopefully, we will win the election, as well.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, Reverend Barber, while you're in Washington right now, you're from North Carolina. That's where you live. The percentage points in your home state, 42% of the vote went to Biden - he, of course, won North Carolina - to Sanders' 24%. Why do you think former Vice President Biden did so well in North Carolina?\n\nREV . WILLIAM BARBER II: Well, first of all, good morning, and to your other guests. And yes, I'm a son of the South, and I'm certainly glad that we're finally having this conversation about the South, because you get over 160, almost 170, electoral votes just out of the former 13 Confederate states. And I'm glad we're having this conversation about African-American voters. Now, I'm on my way planning for June 20th, 2020, the Poor People's Assembly National Moral March on Washington. And I have a little bit different perspective, living in the South all my life, working in the South. I've seen a lot of candidates on the Democratic side win primaries and read their primary numbers one way and then lose in the general election.\n\nSo, here's the question, Amy, and questions that I think we have to raise and that we're looking into this morning. And first of all, the question is - when you say someone won 61% of the black vote, that's good. That should be celebrated. But what is that a percentage of? It's a percentage of those who voted. The other question is: How many weren't inspired to vote? How many weren't inspired to move? Yes, a lot of the initial vote may be based on personality, familiar, and Obama policies. And that's not a bad thing necessarily. But also we have to ask - in those states last night, those 14 states, there are over 40 million poor and low-wealth voters. Now, poor and low-wealth Americans did not support Donald Trump. What was the numbers of poor and low-wealth Americans in those states that turned out or didn't turn out? What didn't inspire them? Some places like Texas, you had 600,000, almost an even split between Sanders and Biden. That means that there is this split in the party, in the soul, for aspirations. How will the party deal with that? Because that is not some clear, far victory that dismisses, say, for instance, Sanders' policies as senseless, as silly, as I've heard some Democrats say. And they have to be very careful with that.\n\nThe last thing is, not only who didn't vote, but in those Southern states - you know, we're talking about this black wall, but are the Dems really going to fight after the primaries? Are they going to really invest in the North Carolinas, the Georgias, the Mississippi, the Alabama, Virginia, after the primaries, in the general elections? Because, you know, in the general election, oftentime we see something very different. For instance, last time, in the Clinton campaign, they left a half-million African-American voters off the table. There was really no real effort to go after. And in all of those states, the number of poor and low-wealth people and the number of African Americans who didn't vote held the political calculus to not elect Donald Trump, that could have fundamentally changed. And I want to know: Are we really seriously now going to focus on the South and focus on bringing together poor blacks and poor whites in the South? Now, if that happens, we can have a fundamental shift in political calculus in this country. You could see states like Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, Mississippi, Florida flip in the general election. But if we don't, if we're just going to deal with primary now and who gets the primary vote, and not look deeper - who didn't vote, who wasn't inspired and why, and how many black people were left out, how many poor people were left out last night and why - then we might end up with a lot of excitement in the primary and a lot of sobbing and sadness in the general election.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: I wanted to bring Elie Mystal back into the conversation. In a recent column in The Nation , you laid out why you thought black voters are opting for Biden, and you said that it's not because they \"lack information.\" Why do you think so many turned out for Biden, even though, understanding, as Reverend Barber says, this is a primary, it's not as representative of an overall subset or a part of the population as the general election?\n\nELIE MYSTAL : I think you have to look at black voters, and I think this links up exactly with what Reverend Barber is saying - who is going to be there for black voters in the future? And are the policies that Bernie Sanders is running on, which I personally think are the right policies for our community and lots of other communities - are white Americans ready to vote for those policies and uplift all people and share the great wealth of this country? Because the answer historically has been no. The answer historically has been that when you ask white people to share the wealth of this country, they say no. They vote with their pocketbooks over their morality. That is how you get an unvarnished bigot and open sexist in the White House over a highly qualified woman. Right? So, that's what white people did in 2016. We have seen this. We have seen the white electorate go for the Republican nominee time and time and time again. Bernie Sanders is out here telling us that white people are ready to vote for real economic redistribution and change. And I don't know that he has convinced black people that white people are ready to do that. And so I don't think that it's fear exactly. I think it is pragmatism. I think that if you don't feel like you have white allies willing to take this pledge with you, well, then you revert back to the most important thing as beating Donald Trump, and that's how you get kind of - that's how you get back to Biden.\n\nNow, one thing I will say, and again, I think this links up - what Reverend Barber is saying is so important. You can start to change this if you continue to invest in the South, because it's not just in terms of your own presidential campaign. We have people running in the South in the Senate, that we desperately need to take back and we desperately need to support. Don't leave South - don't leave Jaime Harrison hanging out there. Jaime Harrison, by the way, seems to support Joe Biden. Don't leave Thom Tillis's seat out there. Don't leave those two seats in Georgia out there. Like, if the top of the ticket reinvests in these Southern states, not only will it help them win the Senate, that's the kind of thing that I think long-term impresses African-American voters that white people are ready to be allies to the cause of social justice and racial equality.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Historian Barbara Ransby, you were among more than 100 leading black scholars, writers, educators, including Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor, Marc Lamont Hill, Gerald Horne, who issued a joint letter endorsing Bernie Sanders this weekend. Can you talk about, specifically, simply, why you believe Senator Sanders should be president and would most benefit African Americans in this country, not to mention all Americans?\n\nBARBARA RANSBY : Right. I'm glad you brought up that ad that we did. We did a statement. There were over a hundred black scholars, people who have devoted their entire lives to not only studying, but standing with the Black Freedom Movement, people who come out of the Black Freedom Movement and out of black communities. And our assessment is - look, I grew up in Detroit, a working-class family. For me, issues of race and class have always been intimately bound up. And I think while, you know, sometimes I'm disappointed, quite frankly, that Bernie Sanders doesn't lead with a racial justice analysis, but when I listen carefully and when I look at the policies, I see a way forward for black working-class people. As an educator, many of my students are first-generation college. They're black and Latinx students. They're deeply, deeply in debt. The $1.6 trillion student debt is of serious concern to all of us who are educators. And that is a very racialized, racially imbalanced debt, falling heavily on people of color, young people of color. Bernie Sanders' commitment to prison reform, to enfranchising incarcerated citizens - I mean, all these things are elements of a progressive vision for the future.\n\nAnd, you know, this thing about white voters, listen, you've got racist - racism is everywhere in the country. It's ubiquitous, right? So you have racist white people who voted for Barack Obama. You've got racist white people who voted for Elizabeth Warren in this primary. You've got racist white people who voted for Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden. So, people vote for a complex set of reasons, and we're not all going to be on the same page in that. And I think what we have to look at is what are the candidates' commitments - right? - around issues of race, and what are the candidates' commitments particularly around poor and working-class people. I think the work that Reverend Barber is doing with the Poor People's Campaign is so important, but also coalitions like The Rising Majority that are looking at a range of issues as they impact the lives of black people. All of this is in the mix when we assess what presidential candidate could best lead us into a brighter, more just and sustainable future.\n\nAnd for us, that candidate is Bernie Sanders. But it's not just Bernie Sanders as a man, as a person. I reserve the right to critique everybody, including people who I love and respect. But it's the campaign that he is building. You know, again, it's people like Chokwe Lumumba in Mississippi, who endorsed him. It's people like Senator Nina Turner. It's people like Phil Agnew, brilliant young organizer from Florida you've had on the show, who was very much a part of the early Black Lives Matter movement and the Movement for Black Lives, deeply respected among a whole ecosystem of young black activists. So, those are the principles that we united around when we formed the statement.\n\nAnd the statement involved a lot of discussion and debate and push and pull about what tone did we want to strike, why was it important for us to do so as educators, and all of that. And so, I hope it's gotten some traction, but we are certainly not alone. I think the young organizers in the Dream Defenders, the organization that Phil Agnew comes out of, their 501(c)(4), did endorse Bernie Sanders, as well. So there are a number of black organizers, activists, educators who see in the Sanders campaign, in the people around him, like AOC , like Ilhan Omar, like Rashida Tlaib, a real hope for a different kind of politic. But again, you know, for us - for me, I would say - it is really a vote-plus strategy. I agree with Reverend Barber that this doesn't end at the primary and can't end at the primaries, but it also can't end in November. We have to be about building a movement. And I think what Bernie Sanders' campaign represented, but also what Elizabeth Warren's campaign represented, that a joining of forces there really represents a hopeful growth of a movement, a multiracial and anti-racist movement for a justice agenda long-term.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Reverend Barber, I'd like to ask you - you tweeted recently that the Dems also need to think about how they keep saying the black vote is the heart of the party, yet when they had a chance to include blacks on the stage, they didn't fight for that, but changed the rules for a billionaire. Your thoughts in terms of the party's two-faced strategy when it comes to the African-American vote, and especially how they treated Kamala Harris or Cory Booker versus how they opened the doors up for Michael Bloomberg?\n\nREV . WILLIAM BARBER II: Well, you know, I've been a part of two campaigns that have actually won in the South, one in Kentucky and Moral Mondays in North Carolina. And I learned that when you address systemic racism, systemic poverty, ecological devastation, the war economy and the false moral narrative of religious nationalism, you can in fact bring black and poor and low-wealth white and black people and Latinos together, and you can make significant change. We have a study coming out now that shows if you just organize 2 to 10% of poor and low-wealth black, white and Latino people in the country, not just in the South, but significantly in the South, you could fundamentally change elections. We have to talk about that.\n\nAnd it's not so much race or class, but it's race and class. I've challenged, for instance, Bernie Sanders and all of the - Biden, all of them, as my sister said, to lead with a race analysis, but not about culture, but about real issues, and to deal with the issue of poverty and low wealth. Sixty-one percent of African Americans live in poverty and low wealth. That's 26 million people. Thirty-seven percent of white people live in poverty and low wealth. That's 66 million people. We will never have a political transformation in the calculus in this country until we deal with the issue of poverty - 140 million people, 43% of this nation.\n\nNow, the issue of how we are treating African Americans. There's all this talk about that African Americans are the heart, are the heart, are the heart of the party. They're the firewall. They're different things. Well, where was all the fervor to ensure that African Americans stayed on the stage? That's an interesting issue. And if we are the heart and if 61% of African Americans are poor and low-wealth, why are most candidates only talking about - if they talk about poverty, they do it - in the Democrats, they use a pseudonym. Republicans racialize poverty. Democrats run from poverty. We talk about the working class, but not poverty. We looked at the issue of poverty in these states, and we said that the number of people who are poor and low-wealth in the Super Tuesday states, in the former Confederate states, far outweigh any margin of victory in Senate races or in presidential races. Why are we scared to say the issue? We will never move people until they hear themselves.\n\nSo here's what I want to put out. If this is a serious conversation about African-American people, then why not every candidate put in writing how will that candidate in the future - not what they've done in the past; in the future - deal with the wealth gap, how will it close the wealth gap, how will it deal with the healthcare gap, how will they deal with racist voter suppression and gerrymandering and expanding access to the ballot, how will they deal with the disparate ecological issues in our communities, how will they deal with militarization in our communities, how will they deal with mass incarceration, resegregation of public schools, how will they increase the number of African Americans in the federal court appointees and increase the number of African Americans in the Senate, and what is the strategy to go after the Senate, that is truly holding up progress for poor and low-wealth people of every race, creed and color? Put it in writing and then change the next debate to be about nothing but the issue of systemic racism and poverty, and not just how racism affects black people, but how it undermines the democracy. For instance, every state that is a racist voter suppression state is also a state where once the people who use racist voter suppression get elected, they then block policies of living wages, block policies of healthcare, and end up hurting more white people, in terms of raw numbers, than black people. So let's have a full, thorough-going debate on these issues. Every candidate needs to say, \"My policies, this is how it's going to impact the black community. This is how it's going to impact the rural community. This is how it's going to impact the Latino community.\" Let's move deep, deep, deep into policy and put that out there. And I believe if that happened, you would not just see a percentage of black votes turning out, that then folks say, well, they got 60% of a vote that may have been only 40% of the total black population, but we will see an increase in the number of participation and a building of alliances. But I also know, finally -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We've got 10 seconds.\n\nREV . WILLIAM BARBER II: - the political system is not going to do that. It's going to take a movement. And that's why the Poor People's Campaign: A National Call for a Moral Revival is engaged.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Reverend Dr. William Barber, I want to thank you for being with us, with the Poor People's Campaign, from North Carolina; historian Barbara Ransby, speaking to us from Illinois; and Elie Mystal of The Nation .\n\nWhen we come back, we speak with the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden . Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

With more than a third of the delegates at stake, Biden swept the Midwest and the South, winning Virginia, North Carolina, Arkansas, Alabama, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Massachusetts, Minnesota and delegate-rich Texas. Sanders saw victories in Colorado, Utah, and the Associated Press reports he is the winner of the grand prize of the night, the largest delegate state of California. He also won his home state of Vermont.\n\nMassachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren finished in an embarrassing third place in her home state. And New York billionaire Mike Bloomberg said he planned to reassess his candidacy, after he spent more than half a billion dollars to score just one victory - in American Samoa.\n\nBiden delivered his victory speech in Los Angeles, where he was interrupted when two protesters with Direct Action Everywhere stormed the stage chanting, \"Let dairy die.\" He began his address with a much-talked-about gaffe.\n\nJOE BIDEN : It's a good night! It's a good night, and it seems to be getting even better. They don't call it Super Tuesday for nothing. By the way, this is my little sister Valerie, and I'm Jill's husband - oh, no, this is not - no, you switched on me. This is my wife. This is my sister. They switched on me. Folks, it's still early, but things are looking awful, awful good. ... So I'm here to report we are very much alive! And make no mistake about it: This campaign will send Donald Trump packing. This campaign is taking off! Join us!\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Meanwhile, Bernie Sanders used his speech at the end of Super Tuesday in his home state of Vermont to contrast his record with Biden and President Donald Trump.\n\nSEN . BERNIE SANDERS : But we are not only taking on the corporate establishment, we're taking on the political establishment. But we're going to win because the people understand it is our campaign, our movement, which is best positioned to defeat Trump. You cannot beat Trump with the same old, same old kind of politics.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Sanders' biggest win came in California. MSNBC and CNN aren't calling it, but the Associated Press is. He won the support of some 55% of Latinx voters, who account for nearly 40% of California's population. His campaign had 23 field offices in California alone. The Latinx community in Texas also showed up in droves for Sanders, with 39% of the vote, compared to Biden, who received 26%, though Texas went to Joe Biden. Latinx voters could also play a key role in states' upcoming primaries in Arizona and Florida.\n\nFor more, we go to Washington, D.C., where we're joined once again by Chuck Rocha. He's senior adviser to Senator Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign. He's been called the architect of Sanders' campaign strategy to mobilize Latinx voters.\n\nWelcome back to Democracy Now! So, let's begin with the big numbers. You've got Joe Biden winning nine states, including, well, your home state of delegate-rich Texas. You've got Bernie Sanders winning, well, four states, if you include California, which AP has called, the largest, the delegate-rich state of California. But this is really being called a victory for Joe Biden. They're talking about \"Joementum,\" because of his surge especially among Southern African-American voters. Chuck Rocha, your analysis of what happened on Super Tuesday?\n\nCHUCK ROCHA : There's no doubt that Joe Biden had a good night last night, but I would argue that Bernie Sanders had a good night. This is not about who wins what state. All of your people that are watching this great program know that it's about the delegate count. And what's we get done counting California, we'll be very close to where Joe Biden is, much like when we came into this race.\n\nAnd we learned a lot last night. Anybody who's worth their weight in salt will know that what you do now is you back up, you see where you did really well - you alluded to the amazing operation we've been running for now months and months in the Latino community - and places where we need to improve. We will reevaluate that now. We'll look towards the states that are coming up, to make sure that we continue to put our shoulder against the wheel and empower all those grassroots activists out there that really make the difference in this campaign.\n\nLet's talk about one big loser last night, and that was the folks running the election system. I get sick and tired of watching good folks stand in line for hours and hours trying to represent democracy by voting. Voting in this country should not be that hard. At the richest country, at the richest in history, we should make it easy for folks to vote, and they don't have to stand in line sometimes for three or four hours. I found that whole process disgusting last night.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Chuck, I wanted to ask you specifically about Texas. From what I can tell, there was maybe about twice as many people who voted in this primary for president in Texas as did in 2016. But clearly, Texas has different - it's a huge state. In East Texas, there's a large African-American community, in places like Houston, obviously a little further north in Dallas. What's your sense of how the turnout and also how the state broke down versus what you expected versus what actually happened?\n\nCHUCK ROCHA : Well, the one thing I will say for sure is the Latino vote almost single-handedly carried the state for Bernie Sanders. But overall, if you look at the African-American vote and the Latino vote, you had Bernie Sanders, who had done all this work in that community. We had been there, spent millions of dollars, empowered that community. You had an African-American community that was very, very much ginned up for Joe Biden. But overall, what I've been seeing, all the way back to the last midterm elections, is this anxiety with people of color and in minority communities around Donald Trump. I think Donald Trump is motivating lots of folks in diverse communities who feel threatened. There's lots of Latinos with brown skin like me, who are U.S. citizens, who feel like we've been demagogued by this president, treated like a second-class citizen. That's why you see a lot of energy out there. And I think Bernie Sanders is capturing some of that. And to give credit where credit's due, Joe Biden has captured some of that, as well.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And would you say the big loser of the night appears to have been Michael Bloomberg, who staked his entire $500 million on being able to avoid the early states and then score big victories on Super Tuesday? That just didn't happen.\n\nCHUCK ROCHA : Well, there are some political consultants in Texas that's already started building their second house on the amount of money they made with Michael Bloomberg, I'll promise you that. And he threw a lot of money away in lots of states and spent lots of time in lots of places, and it just didn't work out for him. It just goes to show that you can't go in and buy an election. You can't go in and try to duplicate something like our grassroots movement by paying activists on the ground. Anybody is welcome to run for president, but he stands against everything we stand for in the Bernie Sanders campaign, of raising donations $5 at a time and empowering regular Americans to be a part of this process.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, NBC is reporting, Chuck, that Biden won the support of 63% of black voters in Virginia, 62% of black voters in Tennessee, 72% of black voters in Alabama. Exit polls show 6 in 10 - let's see, 6 in 10 black voters backed Biden in Texas and North Carolina. According to NBC poll, exit poll , black voters outside of the South were less likely to support Biden, black voters under 45 around three times as likely to support Bernie Sanders than voters [45 and over]. If you can talk - I mean, you were a main architect of the Latino strategy, but you're part of a team that is really also focusing on African-American strategy. It's also interesting that Symone Sanders, who was one of Bernie Sanders' top people, is now one of the top people for Joe Biden. And she is, of course, African-American.\n\nCHUCK ROCHA : Well, let's not forget that Joe Biden was the vice president of Barack Obama, the first black president, who made history, who was an amazing president, who is still the most popular figure in Democratic politics. So there is a piece to overcome there with that piece. That don't mean you give up on that vote and you walk away. When I started this telecast, I said you step back now, and you evaluate what you did, and you reassess, and you change your strategy. We continue to do well with young African Americans, but we can always do better with older African Americans. These folks have come and literally are the backbone of this party, especially black women. And we want to lift up their voices and make sure they have a part of this campaign and that we're doing this in the right way. So I think we can always improve.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Chuck, I wanted to ask you - obviously, whoever is going to be the nominee of the Democratic Party has to get 50% or more of the delegates to be nominated. So far, if you look at - Biden actually got more than 50% of the vote, I think, in two states on Tuesday, and Bernie on one, in Vermont, just over 50% of the vote there. How do you see a path to getting more than 50% of the vote? Because when you add up even the Warren folks, if you're looking at the so-called progressive camp, if you add up the Warren votes and the Sanders votes in many of these states, they don't quite come to 50%. So, how do you see the path to actual nomination?\n\nCHUCK ROCHA : Well, there's a lot of big states coming up, right? And so, there's everything in this - if you've watched this primary from the beginning - and I've been on this particular race over a year and was with Senator Sanders back in '15 - things change quickly. And you're going to have debates. You're going to have chances for people to back up now. The whole field has consolidated. And so, all of that is a strategic decision on resource allocation and where you're really doubling down in certain states. With big states coming up, like Washington state, that we won last time, Michigan, Missouri, then you start looking at Florida and Arizona, and, oh my goodness, Pennsylvania, New York and all these Midwestern states, there's all these different strategies that go in.\n\nOne thing that you should keep your eye on is that Midwest area, with lots of blue-collar, African-American, Latino, white folks who work in unions, all of the above, and around this issue of jobs and trades. A lot of these people have been hoodwinked by President Trump, and they're looking for an alternative now, now that they see that he ain't quite right. They want somebody that they can believe in. And Bernie Sanders has stood with them against every trade deal that sent all of their jobs overseas.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Now, the next group of states, almost a dozen, the majority of them went to Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders in 2016, which is why, although he won California - this is not winner-take-all state, as none of them are - and so they're going to come out around even on the delegates. But he wanted a big cushion from California because of what's coming up next, not possibly favorable to him. Do you have that same assessment?\n\nCHUCK ROCHA : I don't. I don't, because we did really well in Washington, and we did really well when we shocked people in Michigan last time. So there's two states that's coming up immediately that the senator is very popular in. And looking down the road, this is just not the same race. And I just talked about a whole new group of people being motivated to come out because of the undertow of Donald Trump. We're going to fight for every single vote. What really makes us different is our fundraising apparatus with our grassroots activists and those activists making phone calls and knocking on doors. We're fixing to rotate now from the Deep South up to working in the Midwest and some of these Western states, with New York and Pennsylvania. We feel really good about all those states and our grassroots activism in those states.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We want to thank you so much for being with us, Chuck Rocha, senior adviser to Senator Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign. When we come back, we look at Biden's decisive victory with Southern African-American voters. Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

The major battleground state is home to one of the largest Arab American populations in the country, but the movement to vote \"uncommitted\" is now expected to spread to other states, including Minnesota and Washington. \"I've rarely seen such an organic and authentic movement come together,\" says former Democratic congressmember from Michigan Andy Levin. \"We really need actual change in policy, and I think we sent that message strongly last night.\" President of the Arab American Institute James Zogby says that Democratic voters need a reason to come out to the polls. \"We gave them a reason with 'uncommitted.' Joe Biden's got to give them a reason in November,\" says Zogby. \"There is genocide unfolding. People want it to end. The president either is going to have to act decisively to end it, or it's going to have an impact in November.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We begin today's show in Michigan, where President Joe Biden won the Democratic primary Tuesday but faced a significant backlash over his support for Israel's assault on Gaza. Biden won about 81% of the vote, but over 100,000 voters, or more than 13%, cast their ballots for \"uncommitted.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, the group Listen to Michigan urged Democrats to vote \"uncommitted\" to pressure Biden to call on Israel to end its assault on Gaza. Organizers of the campaign had said they were hoping for 10,000 \"uncommitted\" votes, pointing to Donald Trump's win of less than 11,000 votes in 2016, to show the significance of that number. Tuesday's vote shows they got 10 times that amount.\n\nMichigan is the first major battleground state in the general election to hold its primary. It's also home to one of the largest Arab American populations in the country. Top White House officials visited Michigan earlier this month to meet with Arab and Muslim leaders after a number of them refused to meet with Biden's campaign manager.\n\nThe movement to vote \"uncommitted\" will likely spread to other states. Organizers of the movement are holding a call with supporters in Minnesota, which will vote next week, and Washington state, which holds its primary March 12th.\n\nFor more, we're joined by two guests. James Zogby is president of the Arab American Institute. His new opinion piece for Pakistan Today is titled \"Why the USA Continues to Fail the Arab World.\" He's joining us from Utica, New York. We're also joined by former Democratic Congressmember from Michigan Andy Levin. He's joining us from Southfield, Michigan.\n\nWe welcome you both to Democracy Now! You're a former congressmember, Andy Levin. You're also a former synagogue president. Talk about this \"uncommitted\" campaign. For every six votes President Biden got yesterday in the primary, \"uncommitted\" got one. Talk about the organizing effort and what message that you hope that those who supported \"uncommitted,\" like yourself, sent to President Biden.\n\nANDY LEVIN : Well, good morning, Amy and everyone. I don't have much of a voice left, so sorry about that.\n\nIt was really an incredible thing, Amy. You know, I've been organizing for peace for 40 years, and I've rarely seen such an organic and authentic movement come together in, as you say, just three weeks. And we got over 100,000 people to vote \"uncommitted.\" This was something that grew up out of the Arab American and larger Muslim communities in Michigan, but it had great power among progressives, among Jewish people, Christians, Muslims, people of other faiths, people of no faith. College campuses were aflame about this.\n\nAnd the idea was that Michigan has this \"uncommitted\" box on our ballot, because, remember, this is a presidential primary, and some other states do the same thing. You're voting to send delegates to a convention, so you could vote to send delegates \"uncommitted.\" And, in fact, we won so many votes, I believe we will send at least one delegate from two congressional districts: the 6th District, represented by Debbie Dingell, and the 12th District, represented by Rashida Tlaib.\n\nI think the significance of this, Amy, is that the president's people, and maybe the president himself, there's a danger that they see this as sort of like a political problem: \"We need to send surrogates. We need better messaging. People just need to realize what a disaster Trump would be, which, of course, we can never let him get near the White House again. So they'll come around all of this.\" No. This is war. This is the killing of tens of thousands of innocent people, leveling whole neighborhoods, most of the Gaza Strip. We don't just want you to use a better message.\n\nThe message from us to the president yesterday was: You must change course. You must change course for the sake of your political reelection and because it's the right and necessary thing to do from every point of view, including U.S. national security interests, for God's sake. The message to the president is: Stop treating what Bibi Netanyahu says as the boundary of the possible. You've got to move towards an immediate and permanent ceasefire and an end to this carnage, free all the hostages, free political prisoners among the Palestinians, including leading longtime prisoners who - if you don't like Hamas, free Marwan Barghouti, who's been in prison for so long, whom many Palestinians might support to change the situation there. So, we really need actual change in policy, and I think we sent that message strongly last night.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Andy Levin, I wanted to ask you - I was particularly struck by the turnout. The Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said this was a record turnout on Tuesday for a presidential primary. Compared to, for instance, South Carolina, where only 4% of Democrats voted in the primary, here we had over, it looks like, 50%? Could you explain this issue of turnout, as well?\n\nANDY LEVIN : Well, one thing is that there were more - quite a greater number of Republicans voting, or people voting in the Republican primary than the Democratic primary. That's also something that's not great for President Biden. But there was some sense of a contest on that side, right? Even though we all know that Nikki Haley was going to trail by a wide margin.\n\nBut it is remarkable, Juan. Think about it. We have an incumbent Democratic president running for reelection. We all know he's going to be the nominee. Most Democrats feel like maybe he's done a really great job in other areas. Personally, I was really proud to serve with him in the 117th Congress. I'm proud of the Investing in America agenda that we passed, having some, at least a semblance of, industrial policy in America for the first time in many decades, and on and on. But what's remarkable is that this 100,000-plus people who voted \"uncommitted,\" almost all of them, Juan, wouldn't have showed up but for this. They're mad at the president. They would have stayed home.\n\nAnd our message was: Wait a minute. That would be a disaster if you stayed home. He won't get the message. He won't understand. Come out and express your rage. Shake your fist at the president and say, \"Look,\" for most of them, \"I voted for you in 2020. I'm really mad at you right now, and I have to tell you.\" So, that, I think, juiced turnout.\n\nAnd look at East Lansing, where Michigan State University is. Look at Ann Arbor, where the University of Michigan is. It's not just Dearborn and Hamtramck, with our incredible, beautiful concentration of Arab American and other Muslim voters. It's also young people across the state and progressives across the state who said, \"We're your base. We want to win in November. In order to win, we want peace now.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Andy Levin, the last time we talked to you, you were a congressmember. You were running for reelection. AIPAC , the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, had invested millions in Democratic primaries to defeat progressives who supported Palestine. You were one of those they were trying to defeat. You're a self-described Zionist who supports a two-state solution. But earlier, before that primary, a former president of AIPAC described you as \"arguably the most corrosive member of Congress to the U.S.-Israel relationship.\" Can you talk about what happened to you then? You lost that election. But do you see your point of view being embraced much both in Michigan and around the country in a way that AIPAC never imagined?\n\nANDY LEVIN : I do, Amy. I mean, basically, they spent millions of dollars of dark money. They raised a huge amount of so-called hard money for my opponent in that primary, who basically toed the AIPAC line completely. And now they say they're going to spend $100 million in 2022, and evidently they've already raised $44 million to take out progressives in Democratic primaries. And much of their money is coming from Republican billionaires, who don't have any place in a Democratic primary. And shame on us, as Democrats, if we continue to allow Democratic candidates to take Republican money in Democratic primaries.\n\nBut here's the situation. This avalanche of mostly dark money coming to try to interfere with Democratic primaries is running into a tsunami of upset by Democratic base voters who say, \"The Jewish people deserve self-determination. What about the Palestinian people? And, in fact, there is no peace and security for the Jewish people in the Holy Land unless and until we realize the political and human rights of the Palestinian people. And we have to love each other. We have to support each other. We have to find a way to live together.\" And, yes, this is a huge rebuke to that point of view that we must support the Israeli government no matter what they do.\n\nI mean, why are we letting Bibi Netanyahu set the boundary of the possible? This man has never been for a just peace for one day in his life. He has actively opposed Palestinian self-determination his whole career. Like some other people we know, he's fighting to stay in office so that he doesn't go to jail. I mean, come on. You can support the people of Israel and the people of Palestine without supporting these horrible policies and this horrible war.\n\nI mean, you know, think of the average - I think of myself, Amy, 40 years ago, when I was a college student. And if I read what The New York Times reported, for example, that the U.S. was supplying 2,000-pound bombs to Israel, and the IDF was dropping them not just on densely populated areas but on places where they had told the Palestinians to flee, and then, at the end of the article, \"By the way, we've sent 5,000 more of one type of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel since October,\" that Andy Levin 40 years ago is not unlike college students and other young people all around Michigan's campuses and working people, saying, \"Whoa! This is unacceptable.\" And we showed the president that we don't accept it yesterday.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Yeah, I'd to bring in James Zogby to the conversation, get your reaction to the vote in Michigan, and also whether you think that this \"uncommitted\" movement could spread across the country, especially now as we head into Super Tuesday on March 5th.\n\nJAMES ZOGBY : Well, look, number one, I want to thank Andy Levin for his leadership. He made an enormous difference here, and we're so pleased to be partnering, as we were, in this campaign.\n\nSecondly, I think, message sent. A hundred-plus thousand \"uncommitted\" votes, much larger than anyone anticipated, makes a point: President Biden, you ignore this vote at your risk.\n\nAnd thirdly, I think, there, frankly, is not a need to go any further. And I think that it's very clear. We can extrapolate from the rest of the states what the turnout would be in November if we ignore this issue and continue to ignore this issue, not only, as the congressman said, with the Arab American vote, but with young voters, Black voters. We've done polling. My brother John has done polling on this among American voters, not just Arab American voters. The impact that the Gaza war is having on voters under 29, the impact it's having on Black, Latino and Asian voters, who are core to the Democratic coalition, is very clear.\n\nWe just wanted to make a point in Michigan. It was the place to make the point. But, frankly, it can also be read in Virginia. It can be read in Georgia. It can be read in Pennsylvania. You ignore this war, and you continue to offer nothing but anodyne, \"Well, we're really with you, and we feel bad, too, and we're paying attention and working every day,\" that does not cut it at this point. There is genocide unfolding. People want it to end. The president either is going to have to act decisively to end it, or it's going to have an impact in November.\n\nAnd as the congressman said it, as the organizers of this movement have been very clear, this is not the abandon Biden movement. This is the, for God's sake, shape up or you might lose in November Biden movement. And the fact is, is that the president has to listen and change. It's going to be too late for some. The fact that 30,000 have already died, that famine is on the way, that genocide has continued is going to mean a lot of people are going to say, \"I can't do this. I just can't do it.\" But if there's to be any effort at all made to bring some voters back, something dramatic has to happen and change from the White House to say, \"Let's give him another shot.\"\n\nBut, frankly, right now we're having trouble finding that message. And I think Michigan sends a very strong signal, that doesn't have to be repeated anywhere else. Look, when I saw the Emerson College poll out the day before this vote, I said, \"Message sent.\" They had 11%. We got a little - you know, we did a little better than that. They said youth vote was voting \"uncommitted.\" We did that. We showed that. In college towns across the state, we won. \"Uncommitted\" won in Dearborn. It beat Joe Biden. \"Uncommitted\" won in Hamtramck. It beat Joe Biden. Those are the two concentrations of Arab American voters. The president needs to pay attention. And I hope he does. And, you know, I hope he does in a way that is decisive and clear and actually turns the corner.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, James Zogby, of course, in Michigan, the participation of elected officials like Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib and other local Michigan officials did have an impact on that vote. Do you see other Democratic Party officials in other states following that lead?\n\nJAMES ZOGBY : Well, look, we've already seen city councils in 70 cities do this. And that number is growing. There is, not just among Arab American, like - you know, we saw a lot of that in Michigan. We also saw Black officials. We saw progressive Jewish officials. And as important as Rashida was, Andy Levin was an important message sender here that this is a broader movement for justice. And let's not forget that. City councilwoman in Detroit came out just a couple of days before the vote, saying, \"I am with 'uncommitted.'\" That's important, having Black elected officials, Arab American elected officials, progressive Jewish elected officials saying, \"We want this to end, and we want President Biden to make a difference.\" That's important.\n\nAnd so, yeah, I think this is going to have a sort of an effect across the country. And we don't need to do it in other states. We just don't, because the message is very clear. Number one, you know in Michigan there's no way to create an electoral map that you win in November. But, number two, we can extrapolate what happens in Michigan and say, \"Hmm, it's going to happen in Virginia. It's going to happen in Georgia. You're going to lose youth vote, Black vote, Arab American vote. And you don't win Pennsylvania if that's the case.\"\n\nSo, I think, you know, I've been doing this for a long, long time, and I know that these voter groups have to have a reason to turn out. I think what was important about this - and, Congressman, I thank you and others for it - was that you gave people a reason to turn out. These \"uncommitted\" voters would not have turned out, and they would not turn out again in November, if they didn't have a reason to turn out. We gave them a reason with \"uncommitted.\" Joe Biden's got to give them a reason in November.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And talk, Jim Zogby, about the other states. Talk about Minnesota and other states who are now, apparently, adopting this \"uncommitted\" vote. But in Michigan, what's different - right? - is it's actually printed on the ballot. And I think you can also add - I mean, most people didn't - they talked about Dean Phillips, but Marianne Williamson, who suspended her campaign, came in third, and she was the one Democrat for a ceasefire. So you could probably add her votes to the \"uncommitted\" votes.\n\nJAMES ZOGBY : [inaudible], for example, the Arab community said, \"Let's back Marianne Williamson, even though she dropped out,\" because she's on the ballot and there is no other option. Look, let me say, I'm not going to discourage anybody from trying to do it in other states. I just - like I said, I don't think you need to. And I would rather have energy focused on city council resolutions and getting people to sign on to ceasefire resolutions across the board.\n\nThere is a - I did the Palestine statehood resolutions in 1988 with Jesse Jackson. We passed them in 11 states. We got to the national convention, had the first-ever debate from the podium on a minority plank. After that, everybody continued doing it, but without Jesse in the mix, we never had the momentum to carry it through.\n\nWe had a number of ideal things come together in Michigan: a huge concentration of Arab Americans, the support of elected officials, local elected officials, mayors, state reps, etc., city council people. We also had Congressman Levin, who was great on college campuses in terms of mobilizing and bringing people forward, and a great collection of organizers and a budget to make it happen. We're not going to have that in Minnesota. We're not going to have that in other states. And so, I don't want to see people set up for failure. And so, I think you take what happened in Michigan, you extrapolate it to your state, you send the message to President Biden: \"It happened here. It can happen elsewhere.\" There's no need to try to replicate what can't be automatically replicated, given the ideal composition of forces in Michigan that made this happen.\n\nAnd so, I, frankly, think - I don't know what's going to happen in other states, but I don't want to take a defeat in Minnesota, because it's not even on the damn ballot, and say, \"Oh, look, it's\" - and give the other side a crowing rights. They're going to try whatever they can do to crow and say we really didn't - \"They didn't accomplish anything, because 81% still voted for Joe Biden.\" Well, of course 81 voted for Joe Biden. But that's not going to mean November, because in the Emerson poll, Joe Biden is losing by two points. Eleven percent \"uncommitted,\" and Joe Biden loses by two points, hmm, does that - DMFI, Democratic Majority for Israel, don't you get what that means? That means that you need that 11% to come to your side in order to put you over the top. We can say that in every state without having to go through this whole process, especially when it's not even on the ballot and you can't really get the same outcome you get in Michigan.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're going to end with Andy Levin. You come from a political dynasty. Your uncle was the late senator who headed the Armed Services Committee, Carl Levin, I'm sure a close friend of President Biden; your father a congressman, as well, Sandy Levin. What do you think they would say at this point about this movement, about this demand and grassroots organizing?\n\nANDY LEVIN : Well, Amy, Uncle Carl passed away, as you know, several years ago. My dad is 92 and going strong. And he is really proud of what I'm doing. He, you know, was involved in helping Soviet Jews flee to Israel. You know, he supported U.S. policy for a two-state solution forever. But I think he understands that there is no way now, after 54 years of occupation and things going in the wrong direction, there's no way forward unless the president of the United States steps up and leads much more strongly as a peacemaker.\n\nAnd, look, I'm going to end on a hopeful note. Joe Biden, with this long history of chairing the Foreign Relations Committee in the Senate - and, you know, he says he's known all the Israeli leaders, all the Palestinian leaders. You've got to step up, Mr. President, and now end this carnage and lead a diplomatic effort, not a military effort, to end this conflict. It can be done. You've got to step up and do it, both because it's the right thing to do and because your politics depend on it. As Jim Zogby said, the other states are fine. Michigan is a must-win state. Minnesota isn't, you know, for example. He's going to win Minnesota anyway, I think. But you've got to win Michigan to put the Electoral College math together. And I think it's just going to be hard to do unless you change course. So let's get going.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, clearly, President Biden is hearing people. When he was with Seth Meyers the other night, the late-night comic, in an ice cream store, as he was licking his mint chip ice cream, a reporter asked a question about a ceasefire, and he said, yes, he thinks it's going to happen on Monday. That surprised both Israel and Hamas. We'll see what happens. But it was on the eve of the Michigan primary that he said that. Andy Levin, I want to thank you for being with us, former Democratic congressmember from Michigan, and James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute.\n\nWhen we come back, we look at the death of Aaron Bushnell, the active-duty member of the U.S. Air Force who set himself on fire outside the Israeli Embassy in Washington, D.C., to protest U.S. support for the war in Gaza. Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

A group of Michigan Republicans met with President Trump at the White House last week in what was widely viewed as an attempt by Trump to personally pressure the lawmakers to block Biden from being awarded the state's 16 electoral votes. \"This is an attempt to disenfranchise the African American vote and to give the election to Trump,\" says Rev. Wendell Anthony, president of the Detroit branch of the NAACP . \"If we were in a different country, this would be called a coup, a political coup.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The Quarantine Report . I'm Amy Goodman, as we take a closer look at the Republican efforts to overturn President-elect Joe Biden's victory in Michigan. Last Tuesday, election officials in Michigan's largest county certified Joe Biden's victory, after a dramatic reversal. The two white Republicans on the Wayne County Board of Canvassers initially blocked certification, saying they didn't want to include votes from Detroit, which overwhelmingly supported Biden and has a large African American population. President Trump then took to Twitter to praise the Republican effort, saying, \"Having courage is a beautiful thing. The USA stands proud!\"\n\nWell, Reverend Wendell Anthony, the president of the NAACP in Detroit, criticized the Republican efforts to disenfranchise votes in Detroit that night.\n\nREV . WENDELL ANTHONY : You have extracted a Black city out of a county and said the only ones that are at fault or at issue is the city of Detroit, where 80% of the people who reside here are African Americans. Shame on you! Shame on you! ... You are a disgrace as relates to the ability to have a free and impartial election in this nation.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And then I wanted to go to Ned Staebler, who is vice president at Wayne State.\n\nNED STAEBLER : I just want to let you know that the Trump stink, the stain of racism that you, William Hartmann and Monica Palmer, have just covered yourself in, is going to follow you throughout history. Your grandchildren are going to think of you like Bull Connor or George Wallace.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I mean, this was an amazing virtual meeting. And we are joined by Reverend Wendell Anthony now, president of the Detroit branch of the NAACP , the largest branch of the NAACP in the country. He's also a member of the NAACP National Board of Directors. Still with us, New York Times writer Emily Bazelon.\n\nSo, Reverend Wendell Anthony, thanks so much for being with us. Can you describe what is happening right now in Detroit, the amount of rage that was expressed, that actually led to the reversal of these Republican county - what are they called - canvassers, but then they requested to take their vote certifying back?\n\nREV . WENDELL ANTHONY : Well, thank you, Ms. Goodman. Good morning to you and your guest.\n\nIf it was not so tragic, it would simply be pathetic. This is an attempt to disenfranchise the African American vote and to give the election to Donald Trump. We fired Donald Trump, and we hired Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, in Detroit, in Wayne County, which is the largest city in Wayne County, 80, 90% almost, of Black folk who live here. One of the canvassers indicated, as you already said, that perhaps we should just count all the votes in the other areas and not certify the votes that comes from Detroit. This is a strategy that we see around the country: Philadelphia, Atlanta, Wisconsin, Detroit. All of these areas are major urban centers of Black folk. The suburban communities around Detroit, in some cases they had issues much greater than Detroit. They did not say we should not certify them. They said, \"Let's not certify Detroit.\" That's tantamount to \"Let's not certify the Black vote.\" Black votes matter. Black lives matter. That's why we do what we do.\n\nAnd what this is, very simply, if we were in a different country, Ms. Goodman, this would be called a coup, a political coup, because what you have seen is a president that has declared that I will not leave office unless I win; slow the post office down, take out mailboxes, stop the mail from coming through; discredit the guy who's in charge of the election process, who called it the most secure election that we've had - no evidence of fraud, no evidence of voter rigging, none of that; then to have Lindsey Graham calling the secretary of state in Georgia - he's a senator from South Carolina, not Georgia - to get him not to certify and to discount some of the votes. And now we see the latest strategy, since the judges in the courts around America are not going with this nonsense, the move is to not certify: \"If we can not certify, we can delay the election. We can push it back, and then perhaps we can get some new electors. But if we can't get that, maybe we can take it to the Congress and do something different and come out with a different outcome.\"\n\nNo, we voted the way we voted in Wayne County and around the country. We want our votes to count. Certify the vote. This has never happened before. It is a tragedy before God and man. We are not in any moral position to tell any nation anywhere in the world that we should be having democratic processes. How can we go monitor somebody in another nation when we cannot monitor and check ourselves? We need the United Nations, quite frankly, to come in and monitor the United States. Unfortunately, we find ourselves in this situation. This is the worst situation, in terms of the presidential election, that we've had since we have had a nation. Donald Trump was fired. He does not want to leave office, and he's fighting, by any means necessary, to remain at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Reverend Anthony, explain the lawsuit that some Detroiters have brought.\n\nREV . WENDELL ANTHONY : The lawsuit, very simply, started by the Legal Defense Fund and some of the folk in the city of Detroit, is simply saying that you cannot discredit the Black vote. You must certify the Black vote. You cannot pick us out and at the same time let everybody else go, that we want to get in advance and in front of this process, that our votes should be certified, that you are violating the Voting Rights Act. You're violating the civil rights causes of respecting and maintaining a balance of all of the people, that we should not be subjugated.\n\nOne of the things that they're overlooking - I think you mentioned it - is that if you don't certify the vote, if you don't certify the election, you're not certifying all the judges. You're not certifying the senators and those state representatives. You're not certifying the ballot initiatives. You're not certifying the county clerks and the board of trustees and the board of directors of universities.\n\nThat means that all of them will not be certified, in order to preserve one man who's on the golf course, when he should be on the course of trying to stop the coronavirus disease that has now killed 255,000 Americans, more dying every day. As you and I are talking, somebody is dying, while he's playing golf. That's what this is all about.\n\nThat's why we're encouraging everybody to get on the phone, to get on the line, call your senators, call your congresspeople, and when the Board of Canvassers meets today at 1:00, to make sure you're on the line and to make public comment and to let these individuals know that democracy today, democracy tomorrow and democracy should prevail. We've come too far to be turned back now.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Do you see this as an attempted coup, Reverend Anthony?\n\nREV . WENDELL ANTHONY : I do, Ms. Goodman. No question. You know as well as I do. You may not say it, but if you were in a different country, if the leader says, \"I'm not leaving until I win\"; if the leader says to all of his people, \"Don't cooperate with the upcoming administration\"; if the leader says that \"I'm going to fire the people that are at the top\"; if he shifts the military around and tries to get his own minions in position; if he has his cohorts calling other states, which they do not have anything to do with; if he's slowing down the Postal Service; if he's saying, \"Take out the mailboxes, and take out the machines that can do accurate counting\"; if he's saying and bringing legislators into his house and having a meeting and then they're up at his hotel, the Trump Towers; if he's doing all of that in another country, and if he's now saying, at the very last minute, \"OK, those of you who are charged with responsibility to certify the election, why don't you see if you can delay and put it off until another day?\" - if we were in another country, that would be considered as a coup. You know it as well as I do.\n\nAnd the bottom line is, we ain't going for it. This is the United States of America. We are a democratic - supposedly - nation. We have a Constitution. And in case people did not get the memo, Black people, we be free now, y'all. We got the Voting Rights Act. We got the right to vote 150 years ago, Black men did. Women got it a hundred years ago. We got the Voting Rights Act 55 years ago. And now we find ourselves in 2020 still trying to fight the same fight. This is not a time for us to revisit George Wallace standing in the doorway saying, \"Segregation today, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever,\" instead of that, saying, \"No voting today, no voting tomorrow, no voting forever.\" No. We have shed too much blood. We have sweated too much pain. And we've shed too many tears. Our vote must count. Certify the vote. Don't play with it. Deal with it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And as you've pointed out, this is all happening during a pandemic, so people risked their lives to go out to vote. And who are the hardest-hit communities when it comes to the pandemic and people dying are communities of color, African Americans one of the worst hit in this country. And, of course, Detroit, a large African American population. You mentioned the flying in of the state legislators, the head of the House and the Senate, the state House and the state Senate, Michigan legislators, that Trump met with on Friday. They go to Trump Hotel there, are seen drinking an $800 bottle of Dom Pérignon.\n\nEmily Bazelon, I wanted to bring in the issue of fundraising. Do you think part of why President Trump is doing this, that if in fact he can't accomplish this, he will accomplish endless fundraising to fund his so-called election fraud, his attempts to overthrow the election, which then he can personally use?\n\nEMILY BAZELON : Well, the fundraising appeals have made clear, in the fine print, that up to 60% of the funds raised can be used for retiring campaign debt and other expenses, rather than this litigation. So, I think we see right there evidence for what you're talking about.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And do you think that this can succeed today in Michigan, and what it means? Because, remember, also we are talking about Wisconsin being told they have to recount their votes.\n\nEMILY BAZELON : I don't think that President Trump's efforts to overturn the election will succeed. I think that American democracy is actually withstanding his assaults pretty effectively.\n\nThat said, I completely understand Reverend Anthony's distress and call to action in Michigan today, because this vote of the state Board of Canvassers could make things more complicated. If the Board of Canvasser members don't do their job and certify the election, it's going to throw into confusion what happens next.\n\nI think the answer to what happens next is that there will be a court case filed, and presumably, when you look at the previous cases, there's nothing quite like this in Michigan law, but there have been county boards that have refused to certify in the past, and the state courts have ordered them to do so. So, when I look at those precedents and what the law says in Michigan, it looks to me like the state Board of Canvassers would be ordered by a court to certify the election, and then everyone's votes will count, just the way democracy is supposed to work. But it will be a kind of foul-up in the process, and I think it will be embarrassing to the state of Michigan.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And before we go, I wanted to ask you about something else you've been writing about, Emily Bazelon, and that is the census and how that fits into future elections.\n\nEMILY BAZELON : The census is critical to future elections. I think sometimes it's harder for people to focus on it. We kind of take it for granted. But it is how we count the population. And then those totals are used to decide apportionment and redistricting. So, that means how many House seats each state gets. That's determined by the count in the census. And the same is true about carving up legislative districts, according to the \"one person, one vote\" rule within states. We also care a lot about the census because it's how we allocate millions and millions of dollars of tax resources. So, it is critical for the census to be accurate.\n\nAnd what we've seen in the last couple of years is the Trump administration's efforts to basically sideline people who are not citizens, who are undocumented, from the count. And they have currently ordered the census to provide data that would allow President Trump, before he leaves office, to strip undocumented immigrants from the apportionment totals. That would increase the power of Republicans in the House of Representatives. It's a pretty naked power play. And so, what we saw last week was Census Bureau officials saying, \"We need more time to do our count right. We need more time to do our jobs.\" And we have yet to see how that plays out through the end of Trump's term.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And, Emily, if a coup attempt fails, it's still a coup attempt. At what point will there be serious legal consequences for Trump and those who abet him?\n\nEMILY BAZELON : That's a really good question. I don't think we're going to have an answer to that until after he leaves office.\n\nWhat I do want to make clear is, this was an incredibly well-conducted election under seriously adverse circumstances. We had the pandemic. We had a president who was assaulting, in particular, vote by mail for many months. And yet thousands of election officials in states and counties, they just did their jobs, and they made sure that people could vote. It wasn't perfect. There were still long lines. We have lots of problems with voter suppression in America. They're not gone. But in terms of being able to trust the integrity of these results, of the people who did this work, I did a lot of reporting on them throughout the country, and I think it's really important to remember that one of the sad things about this attack on the election is that, actually, we were incredibly lucky, and the election went well - not just luck, I should say. A lot of people's really hard work went into making sure that was the case.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And finally, Reverend Wendell Anthony, you get the final word here. You talked about 1:00 Michigan time being the time of the state Board of Canvassers - two Republicans, two Democrats - voting. What are you calling for at that point? And when it comes to the Republican leaders in your state, in the Legislature, are there people that you hold out that are speaking out? And what are you demanding of Democrats and Republicans right now in Michigan?\n\nREV . WENDELL ANTHONY : Well, Ms. Goodman, all I really want people to do is to do their job. That's all they have to do. Their charge is to certify the vote. Eighty-three counties in Michigan have certified the vote. This Constitution and their ordinance indicates that you shall certify the vote, doesn't mean - there's nothing ambiguous about that. It's no \"If I would, I should, I could.\" And you don't even have to think about it. You just go and do your job and certify. And so, the issue now becomes whether or not they have the will to do it, has somebody tainted that or interfered with that, or someone suggested that \"Let's delay this.\" That's the real issue.\n\nSo, we're demanding, number one, that they do their job. We're simply saying that at 1:00, when the canvassers meet, people should be on the line. People should be monitoring the meeting. People should state their case right now. People should call Shirkey, they should call Chatfield, and indicate that \"We want you to make sure that you don't tamper with this election. You have said that you've seen nothing that should discord or disconnect you from the election, and so, therefore, go ahead and do the right thing. Don't tamper with it. Don't delay it. Don't have unnecessary court cases.\" Because court cases means delay. That means that we've got to go through a process.\n\nWhat a process we've already undergone! We voted. People stood in lines. We went to the polls. We passed out literature. We made phone calls. We did robocalling. We were on the radio. We were on TV. We knocked on doors. We had parades to the polls. We had folks to come early and do what they were told: vote early, vote absentee, do your mail-in thing. They told their people to come and vote on Election Day. Both groups did what they were told. Now you're mad because all the votes came in early and that you've lost. He was defeated in Michigan 15 times by the number of which he won Michigan in 2016, Trump.\n\nAnd so, we're simply saying that \"Do not tamper with the millions of people in the state of Michigan who voted to fire Donald Trump and to hire Joe Biden.\" This is hypocrisy of the highest order. History is not going to reward them well for this, but more important that history is today's story, dealing with certifying the election. We did it. We voted. And let now the vote be counted. Let every vote count, and count every vote. And let's do that with certification.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, Reverend Wendell Anthony, I want to thank you for being with us, president of Detroit's NAACP , also serves on the national board of the NAACP . And again, in 2016, President Trump won Michigan by just over 10,000 votes. President-elect Joe Biden won the state in 2020 by over 150,000 votes. I also want to thank Emily Bazelon, New York Times Magazine writer, co-host of the Slate podcast Political Gabfest .\n\nWhen we come back, Pfizer and Moderna's COVID -19 vaccines relied heavily on taxpayer-funded research. Public Citizen says the vaccines belong to the people, not private corporations. What does that mean? Coming up in a moment.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

The so-called \"caging list\" could be used to block and harass African-American voters. [includes rush transcript]\n\nConcerns continue to mount across the country over the fairness of next Tuesday's election. Already problems have emerged in many states. In one county in Ohio, more than 900 registered voters have been told they must appear in court on Saturday to defend their voter eligibility or risk losing their right to vote. In Wisconsin, scores of students report that their local elections board says it has no record of their voter registration. In Nevada, fallout continues after the it emerged that a group registering voters had destroyed possible hundreds of ballots of voters who identified themselves as Democrats. But nowhere is concern greater than in the state of Florida, the epicenter of the theft of the election in 2000.\n\nYesterday, the deputy election supervisor in one of Florida's most populous counties admitted that some 60,000 absentee ballots had gone missing. Broward county election official Gisela Salas said the matter is under investigation by law enforcement agencies. In 2000, it was Broward county that gave Al Gore his strongest support in the state of Florida. The US Postal Service says it has investigators trying to find the missing ballots, which constitute 5 percent of Broward County's electorate.\n\nThis comes as investigative reporter Greg Palast obtained a secret document from inside Bush campaign headquarters in Florida. The document suggests a plan-possibly in violation of the law-to disrupt voting in the state\"s African-American voting districts.\n\nTwo e-mails, prepared for the executive director of the Bush campaign in Florida and the campaign's national research director in Washington DC, contain a 15-page so-called \"caging list\". It lists more than 1,800 names and addresses of voters in predominantly Black and traditionally Democratic areas of Jacksonville, Florida. Palast broke the story on BBC's Newsnight program. Today, we broadcast the story in its entirety for the first time on US television and radio. Here is Greg Palast's report.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Today we broadcast the story in its entirety for the first time in the united states on U.S. television and radio here. Here is Greg Palast's report.\n\nWILLIE STEEN : I'm happy, I'm excited, and I'm ready to vote.\n\nGREG PALAST : Willie Steen's his way to vote...he hopes. In the last election, he was one of thousands of black citizens stopped from voting when they were falsely tagged as criminals.\n\nWILLIE STEEN : I went in the place to vote and I was with my son, and there's about forty or fifty other people around, and I got up there to vote, and they told me that I was a convicted felony. I told the young lady that I never been arrested before.\n\nGREG PALAST : Enthusiastic Americans like Willie can now vote early in the weeks before election day. Willie sued governor Jeb Bush after Jeb's officials were caught playing games with the voter list, dropping legal voters, especially black ones, who overwhelmingly vote for Democrats.\n\nWILLIE STEEN : Hey, how are you doing?\n\nGREG PALAST : This is as far as Willie got last time. Will he be blocked yet again? We leave Willie in Tampa to go just past Disneyworld to Faithworld. Here in Orlando, the faithful, who believe they were cheated last time, pray it won't happen again. In the last election, one million black votes were not counted.\n\nFAITHWORLD PREACHER : The Reverend Jesse Jackson.\n\nJESSE JACKSON : You don't have to vote the way I vote. But I shouldn't steal your vote, in the name of Democracy. The winner shouldn't lose and the loser shouldn't win.\n\nGREG PALAST : Jackson fears that the Republicans have some new plan to block the black vote, not just the fake felon scam used last time on Willie Steen.\n\nJESSE JACKSON : There are more Mr. Steens out there, and now you have a case of this is a guy who just may be a kind of biopsy - a kind of political biopsy of a cancer that is much more widespread than just one example. You can't forget the stealing of your birthright. You can't forget disenfranchisement of your vote.\n\nGREG PALAST : A hundred miles away in the riverside town of Jacksonville, we may have found the evidence of the plan Jesse Jackson fears: something called a \"caging list,\" which could capture black voters. This is a list of nearly 2,000 voters in the black neighborhoods of Jacksonville, who appear to have errors in their mailing addresses. The list was specially prepared for George Bush's campaign.\n\nGEORGE BUSH : There is no doubt in my mind that, with your help, we'll carry Florida again, and win a great victory on November the 2nd.\n\nION SANCHO : Every one of these has to be hand entered, and -\n\nGREG PALAST : We asked Ion Sancho why the Republicans might put together such a list. Sancho is a Democrat; but he's also one of the most respected and experienced of Florida's county elections supervisors.\n\nION SANCHO : The only thing that I can think of African-American voters listed like this, these might be potential individuals that will be challenged if they attempt to vote on election day.\n\nGREG PALAST : American states allow political parties to place their people right inside the polling stations, like this one in Jacksonville. They can point to a voter and challenge their right to vote. Voters will be turned away with provisional ballots, which are usually just thrown out. Political parties rarely use challenges because they can bring voting to a halt.\n\nION SANCHO : In Leon county, for example, we have not had one challenged voter in the sixteen years that I've been the supervisor of elections. Because again, if you challenge voters, you really must do so with concrete, hard evidence, not your opinion. And this process can be used to slow down the voting process, to cause chaos on election day and, quite frankly, to discourage voters from voting.\n\nGREG PALAST : Do the Republicans have a plan to launch thousands of challenges on November 2nd, and bring voting in Florida's black, Democratic precincts to a standstill? This is the caging list. And this it where it was sent: to the office of Brett Doster. He's the Executive Director of the George W. Bush for President Campaign in Florida. Let's ask his team about it. I asked Republican spokeswoman, Mindy Tucker Fletcher, if they had a strategy to challenge these black voters on election day.\n\nMINDY TUCKER FLETCHER : I can't tell you right now. I don't - I'm not part of the - that strategy,\n\nGREG PALAST : OK.\n\nMINDY TUCKER FLETCHER : But I - I - this is - this was not done in order to create a challenge list, as you, I think, were trying to get to.\n\nGREG PALAST : But they accuse Democrats of registering voters illegally; so Republicans must counterattack. So you're saying your poll workers will be instructed to challenge people to say they should have a provisional ballot?\n\nMINDY TUCKER FLETCHER : Where it's stated in the law, yeah.\n\nGREG PALAST : Are you worried that will gum up the procedures for legal voters.\n\nMINDY TUCKER FLETCHER : By enforcing the laws?\n\nGREG PALAST : Well, that's a good question.\n\nMINDY TUCKER FLETCHER : I imagine even the people in line would want the laws applied.\n\nGREG PALAST : The law appears to be applied in a curious way in Florida. Across the road from the Jacksonville voting station, I spied someone hiding away a camera in a black s.u.v. with blacked-out windows. He was disguised in a tourist uniform, complete with shorts, baseball cap, and open-toed sandals. He had been filming every voter. I thought I'd say hello. This isn't just a hobby? You're just not doing this volunteer?\n\nDOUG THE INVESTIGATOR : No.\n\nGREG PALAST : OK.\n\nDOUG THE INVESTIGATOR : No. I'm an investigator. This is my -\n\nGREG PALAST : Are you a licensed investigator, or ...? A professional agency, then. It's not - you're not like some frea - you know, just some guy who decided he's going to do something. He remembered that his name was 'Doug,' but he couldn't remember who he was working for. The local congresswoman had a suggestion.\n\nCONGRESSWOMAN : The Republicans, once again, are trying to intimidate African-American voters. This car have been here since the eighteenth, in front of the supervisor's office all day, and they have been filming.\n\nGREG PALAST : Back in Tallahassee, another election scam surfaced which could sabotage thousands of voter registrations. It targeted students with liberal views. Election supervisor Ion Sancho discovered the scam struck close to home.\n\nION SANCHO : This, for example, is a copy of my step-daughter's voter registration from Orlando; and it is clear that her own handwriting filled in blocks two through fifteen. Apparently, a petition form was placed over the top of a voter registration form. It purported to tell the citizen they were signing a petition to legalize medical marijuana. The citizen filled it in, thinking that's what they were doing, and then after the voter had left, the individual fraudulently filled out lines one, the party change, making them a Republican now, and then fraudulently signed it, and then turned the application over to the election administrator. This form changed the voter's registration from Tallahassee to Orlando. And if this voter had not known me, and turned this information over to me, she may have been - she may have been disenfranchised when she attempted to vote.\n\nGREG PALAST : Is it a crime to misregister someone in that way?\n\nION SANCHO : It is a third degree felony to do this. It is an illegal act.\n\nGREG PALAST : And the Republicans now admit it was their operatives who collected these thousands of suspect registrations, though the party denies it committed fraud. Civil rights experts in Washington fear the threat to a free and fair election is severe, and unprecedented. Ralph Neas is commander-in-chief of an army of 6,000 lawyers who will take up battle stations on election day, to protect voters from dirty tricks.\n\nRALPH NEAS : This is the nerve center.\n\nGREG PALAST : Right.\n\nRALPH NEAS : There will be fifty-six of our field offices in the seventeen states, and then there will be thirty-eight legal command centers where the majority of the lawyers will be. There will be a law student or lawyer at every precinct; but if there are real problems, we've got mobile traveling vans of lawyers who will go to the troubled precincts and make the decision.\n\nGREG PALAST : They'll keep their eyes open for mass challenges by poll watchers paid for by the Republican party. It may be disruptive, but it's perfectly legal to challenge voters; but if you target the challenges at black districts, like Jacksonville, you're breaking federal law.\n\nRALPH NEAS : You cannot target districts, with respect to challenging voters, if race is a consideration. Doesn't even have to be the major factor. You cannot target on the basis of race.\n\nWILLIE STEEN : Thanks.\n\nGREG PALAST : Back in Tampa, Willie Steen finally gets to vote. But this happy ending was thanks only to \"Newsnight.\" The day before he was still listed as a criminal felon, but when we turned up with cameras, his status magically changed to upright citizen who can vote unchallenged. But what about the thousands of others, without TV cameras, who will have to overcome the new tricks, caging lists, registration games and more in the 2004 battle of the ballot?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Investigative report by Greg Palast for BBC's \"Newsnight\", first aired here on Democracy Now! in the United States. This is Democracy Now! When we come back, Greg Palast joins us live in our studios.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Our guest is investigative reporter, Greg Palast. Juan.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : Greg, congratulations on another terrific report. I guess the people in England and Europe are more informed on the shenanigans going on in the United States.\n\nGREG PALAST : They're absolutely horrified. They are watching black cars with blacked out windows surveilling black voters. You are seeing challenge lists. To the rest of the world, the reaction in Europe to the report this led the BBC news in Europe, and the reaction was, the US is running election like Zimbabwe.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Didn't this happen in 2000, that your reports, first exposing what was going on in Florida, appeared in Britain and Europe, and the US press didn't touch it for months?\n\nGREG PALAST : Only -- I broke the story on BBC and in The Guardian , that tens of thousands of voters were falsely listed as felons and barred from voting. Basically, it was black people who were only guilty of voting while black. In the film, we have one of those people, Willie Steen, and I want to emphasize that because the Republican Election Supervisor was tipped off of our coming down with the cameras to watch him vote, even though the state said --\n\nAMY GOODMAN : He was doing early voting.\n\nGREG PALAST : He was doing early voting, that one hour before he voted, they changed his status from felon to upright citizen, so he could vote. There's still - the U.S. press doesn't cover this.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : And who was it who tipped him off? You told us off camera. Can you tell us on camera?\n\nGREG PALAST : One of the major newspapers in America is foolishly still not covering the story. It's hard to cover the story. You have to understand, BBC has been threatened by the Republican National Committee.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : What was the newspaper? A reporter from the major newspaper?\n\nGREG PALAST : I cannot say.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : OK. It's a major newspaper in New York, right?\n\nGREG PALAST : I understand.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What about BBC . You are talking about being threatened?\n\nGREG PALAST : Yeah. That's why I'm grateful that you have run the report today. Because the Republican National Committee is threatening BBC , as they have done before with my reports, saying that if Greg Palast is on the air there will be no interviews for the network. From the Republican National Committee, which is, of course, cutting off the air supply of the news organization, and you can immediately see why American news organizations won't touch the story. That's basically that the Republican Party has a hit list of black people they're going to try to wipe out on Election Day, stop them from voting, and in particular, this has the effect of not only of intimidating the voters, eliminating voters, but in places like Jacksonville where three and four-hour waits are expected, this could entirely sabotage the voting operation. Understand, this is illegal if they're targeting black folk. It is against federal law.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We saw that scene of Congress member Corrine Brown in Jacksonville. Explain what she was saying.\n\nGREG PALAST : The BBC cameras were there to interview her about voter harassment, and it just so happened that we caught a guy in the blacked out car with a telephoto lens filming each of voters going into the early voting booth. It's mostly black voters doing early voting. This may be related to this so-called caging list to knock out the block vote.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : Also, the segment where you went into the fake registrations or the ones that where signatures were falsified. How expensive was that?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And explain who that this guy is.\n\nGREG PALAST : What you saw was a guy, Ion Sancho, who is probably considered the most experienced and respected of election supervisors in Florida. Unfortunately, my one mistake was to identify him as a Democrat, because the Republicans told me he was a Democrat. He's very independent, not affiliated with any party. He has also asked the parties not to challenge voters on Election Day. The supervisors have said it's really never been done in Florida history. This basically is an attempt to stop the entire voting process, bring it to a halt. As for registrations, what happened was that students, mostly Democrats, students filled out petition forms for medical use of marijuana, and it turns out they were signing the back of registration forms without knowing it, reregistering themselves as republicans. This was definitely tied to a republican-paid operation, and at least 4,000 of the forged registrations, which is a felony to forge registration, have been found, and Jeb Bush's department of law enforcement says that they don't have time for the next few weeks to get around to arresting the forgers. It's just - this is just the beginning of the game.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What does it mean that they have now registered as Republicans? Can they still vote?\n\nGREG PALAST : No, they cannot. They have now double- registered. They only got caught because the Election Supervisor's daughter was caught in the scam. If she had put in an absentee ballot, if this wasn't caught in her case, her ballot would be thrown out.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : He also said they were being reregistered in another county, therefore, creating problems?\n\nGREG PALAST : Yes. In other words, basically setting up the voter to have their vote voided because they're double registered. And again, this is just one of the several games we are finding, for example, the felon purge, which our press here has said is over with believe me, it ain't. Most of the people of the 93,000 people tagged in the first round as felons, who are legal voters, mostly Democrats, 4 to 1 Democrats, just so you know, 4 to 1 Democrat registered. Most of those are still purged. They're still playing games with these people. Then you've also got games with absentee ballots. One thing that's not come out in the story about Broward County, and the ballots missing, you have to understand that Jeb Bush fired a black female Democrat who was elections supervisor, who was elected, replaced her with his own appointee, who is suddenly now not sending out absentee ballots in a heavily Democratic area.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : This is Broward?\n\nGREG PALAST : Broward. You have Jeb Bush appointing Republicans to replace Democrats, who are then impeding the vote, as in Jacksonville where a Republican was just appointed to take over, and he's making it almost impossible for black people to vote. Jacksonville, by the way, is the largest physical city in the United States with one polling place for early voting, again to stop the churches and Jesse Jackson and his group from bringing in thousands of voters to vote.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So again, this top news, as many as 58,000 absentee ballots have gone missing in Broward County, ballots said to have been mailed two weeks ago, but somehow, they have disappeared. Now there's a lot of finger pointing, the county is blaming the postal service. The post office said, No, we didn't get them.\n\nGREG PALAST : You have to understand the games that are being played. Theresa LePore, Madame Butterfly from Palm Beach, who is an ally of Jeb Bush, was just defeated a few weeks ago in her own re-election. She will still be counting votes in November. In the last race, a couple of weeks ago, she counted 37,000 votes from 31,000 absentee ballots. It was like Fishes and Loaves. The problem is, if she had gone the other way, we would not have caught her. If she counted 31,000 votes out of 37,000 ballots. Do not, I recommend to people, don't use absentee ballots. You don't know where they're going and what they're doing with them. That's the great scams of this election. The thing is that it's all aimed racially. And you have to understand, who are people on the caging list that the Republicans appear to be ready to challenge? They include people whose addresses they claim cannot be verified. I verified some of these addresses. I found 50 guys shipped out from the military, so their addresses changed from the poor neighborhoods of Jacksonville to Baghdad. And they are going to challenge these soldiers' votes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : How did you get the caging list?\n\nGREG PALAST : If I said that, I wouldn't receive any more lists. Let me tell you, if anyone has any lists or good items, go to Gregpalast.com. I love it, especially if it's marked secret or confidential on the top.\n\nJUAN GONZALEZ : There's no reason, obviously, to assume if this kind of situation is occurring in Florida, that it's not occurring in other states as well, other battleground states.\n\nGREG PALAST : I have to tell you that I have been writing a story called \"Other Floridas.\" New Mexico - there's non-count of vote in the Hispanic areas and Native American areas. Colorado they're starting a felon purge, days before the election which is against federal law, by the Republican Secretary of State. In Harper's, in this month's issue, I have gone through how the change in machinery to computers is going to cost hundreds of thousands of African American votes, Democratic Party votes. We figure our analysis is that in southern Florida alone, the change to computer also cost 27,000 votes - will cost John Kerry a net of 27,000 votes. So, it's even the machinery. We have Hispanic precincts in New Mexico which in the last race showed no vote at all for president, and the response they get from elections officials, some people cannot make up their mind. What's happening is in poor areas, they're being given crap machines, just like they get crap hospitals and crap schools. They know this means that a lot of votes are lost in the machinery, whether its computers or punch cards. You name it. You have a loss of - by the US Civil Rights Commission statisticians that I have been working with, we calculated a loss of 1 million black and minority votes lost in the machines. This is a tremendous electoral thumb on the scale, when we are going into this Tuesday. It's nationwide. I concentrated on Florida, because Florida will be Florida again. Look to, if you are going to see it election shoplifted, New Mexico, Colorado, Ohio. Those are going to be states where you cannot trust the vote.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We want to thank you very much, Greg Palast for joining us. Investigative reporter with this explosive report.\n\nGREG PALAST : Thank you very much.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum said he is prepared for a possible recount, as his margin with Republican opponent Ron DeSantis narrowed to less than half a percentage point Thursday. A recount is triggered in Florida if the winning candidate's margin is less than half a percentage point. Incumbent Democratic Senator Bill Nelson and Republican Governor Rick Scott will likely also head to a recount in the Senate race, with Scott leading by less than a quarter percentage point as of Thursday. Republican Florida Gov. Rick Scott is also suing the Democratic election supervisors of Broward and Palm Beach counties, accusing them of trying to steal the election. Andrea Cristina Mercado, executive director of The New Florida Majority, joins us to discuss the group's grassroots organizing to expand the electorate in Florida. She also details reports of widespread voting problems on Tuesday, including confusion over ballot design and problems with accessing polling sites and navigating Florida's voter ID law.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I'm Amy Goodman, as we go to Florida, where, days after the midterm elections, the state's races for Senate and governor appear to be heading for recounts. Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum said he's prepared for a possible recount, as his margin with Republican opponent Ron DeSantis narrowed to less than half a percentage point Thursday. Gillum conceded to DeSantis election night after the race was called for his opponent, but the margin has since tightened. A recount is triggered in Florida if the winning candidate's margin is less than half a percentage point. Incumbent Democratic Senator Bill Nelson and Republican Governor Rick Scott will likely also head to a recount in the Senate race, with Scott leading by less than a quarter of a percentage point as of Thursday. That's .2 percent.\n\nOn Thursday evening, Republican Florida Governor Rick Scott sued the Democratic elections supervisors of Broward and Palm Beach counties. He accused them of-quote, \"unethical liberals\" of trying to steal the election.\n\nGOV . RICK SCOTT : We've all seen the incompetence and the irregularities in vote tabulations in Broward and Palm Beach for years. Well, here we go again. I will not sit idly by while unethical liberals try to steal this election from the great people of Florida. Senator Nelson hired one of Hillary Clinton's lawyers from D.C., and the first thing he did was tell reporters that he's here to win the election. He did not say he is here-he did not say that he wants a full and fair election or even an accurate vote count.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : These will be the first statewide recounts since Bush v. Gore in 2000.\n\nFor more, we go to Ft. Lauderdale, where we're joined by Andrea Cristina Mercado, executive director of The New Florida Majority.\n\nWelcome to Democracy Now! Please explain to the country what's happening in your state, Andrea.\n\nANDREA CRISTINA MERCADO : I'm here in the heart of Broward County, where we are still waiting for every vote to be counted. You know, this was a-we had a race, in the governor's race, that was historic and significant. Andrew Gillum had an upset victory in the primary. We endorsed him and ran one of the largest field programs, because we know that candidates that run on transformative platforms can energize a new electorate and bring out people who don't usually come to the polls. And we saw historic turnout: 250,000 people who didn't vote in 2016 voted in this election. And yet, on election night, as is so often the case in Florida, it was razor-thin margins. And it was pointing towards a DeSantis victory.\n\nAnd yet, every vote remains to be counted here in Broward County. Many of our votes have not yet been tabulated. And Andrew Gillum is now within what is triggered for an automatic machine recount. And Senator Nelson is headed for a manual recount, a recount that happens by hand when a race is won or lost by less than a quarter of a percentage point. This is, you know, 15,000 votes in a state with over 20 million people. So there's a lot of people on the edge of their seats that are really hoping that actually the forces for unity and a vision for a Florida where all of us belong will prevail in this election, in some of these key races.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Florida's chief legal officer, the secretary of state, Ken Detzner, told county election supervisors to plan for three statewide recounts.\n\nANDREA CRISTINA MERCADO : That's correct. So we have Andrew Gillum and DeSantis, the governor's race, is heading to a machine recount. Senator Nelson and Rick Scott is headed to a manual recount. And Nikki Fried, the agriculture commissioner, is now up 3,000 votes as the votes in Broward County continue to be tabulated.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, can you explain, Andrea, what's going on in Broward? I mean, we all-those who were born by 2000, with Bush v. Gore , the whole issue of chads and everything else-explain what's happened on that ballot and how difficult it was to read and why so many people who filled out their choice for governor actually didn't vote in the Senate race.\n\nANDREA CRISTINA MERCADO : Yeah. I mean, it's very frustrating for all of us here in Broward County. I was in that voting booth with my two daughters and really had to search for where I was going to vote for U.S. Senate. It was on the left-hand side and below many of the other significant statewide races. And so it was a little bit hidden and obscured. The design of the ballot was flawed. And we believe that that's resulted in, you know, tens of thousands of people not voting in the race for U.S. Senate, while they voted for many other statewide races.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What happened in Little-\n\nANDREA CRISTINA MERCADO : And it's very concerning.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What happened in Little Miami-rather, Little Haiti in Miami, the early voting site different than the voting site on the day of the midterms?\n\nANDREA CRISTINA MERCADO : Yeah. I mean, I think the-you know, we've seen, for years, the ways that the vote is suppressed. Some of it is done by laws, like the law that we had on the books where people with a criminal record, after they had done their time, were not allowed to participate in our democracy-over 1.4 million Floridians. We just overturned that on Election Day, which is incredibly significant. There are all kinds of other laws, voter ID laws. I spoke to an 86-year-old woman yesterday who had to fill out a provisional ballot because her driver's license was expired. Imagine that: She's 86, she doesn't drive anymore.\n\nAnd in addition to that, there are attempts to confuse voters. So, in Little Haiti, there was one very prominent site in the Haitian community that was used as an early voting site. And on Election Day, hundreds of seniors were lined up there to cast a historic vote for Andrew Gillum, and yet that location was not actually a voting place on Election Day, and people were told that they had to go elsewhere. And so we were scrambling to find out how do we get seniors and people with limited mobility to the correct voting place.\n\nSo, you know, and I think we're still investigating other ways that the vote may have been suppressed. And I wouldn't be surprised if-you know, stories have been emerging, and I wouldn't be more surprised if more stories continue to emerge over the next few days.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, finally, the issue of Amendment 4, this historic amendment that passed overwhelmingly that means 1.4 million Floridians will now be allowed to vote, one of the largest enfranchisement actions in history. You know, young people being able to vote back in the '70s, going from 21 to 18, and back to women being able to vote in 1920. One-point-four million Floridians could now vote in 2020, who had felonies on their record, were barred from voting. Now they will be able to. What difference would that make today?\n\nANDREA CRISTINA MERCADO : Oh, absolutely. I mean, essentially, Andrew Gillum got within half a percentage point while he was missing 18 percent of the black vote in the state. You know, we all know that criminalization disproportionately impacts African Americans and communities of color. And there is now 1.4 million Floridians who have been disenfranchised, largely people of color, who will be able to vote in the next election. So, I think this has forever changed the political calculus in Florida. And, you know, we truly believe that the forces for social justice and economic justice and racial equity, it's just a matter of time before we prevail and that we will overcome all the odds and voter suppression and every other dirty trick in the book, and soon secure victory and elect politicians that we believe will really fight for our communities.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : If Andrew Gillum were to win the governorship, he'd be the first black governor of Florida. He seemed as surprised as many other people, Andrea.\n\nANDREA CRISTINA MERCADO : At the narrowing-at the shrinking margins? Or-I mean, I think it's been a-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Yes, that there could be a recount triggered.\n\nANDREA CRISTINA MERCADO : Absolutely. I mean, I think Tuesday night was a-it was a hard night. It was a bitter pill to swallow. But, you know, I think, for us, we know that our movements will never concede to hate. We will never concede to homophobia. We will never concede to bigotry. And we will be here insisting that every vote is counted. There were hundreds of volunteers across the state yesterday making sure that people who had cast provisional ballots had done what they needed to do to make sure that their voice was heard. And we'll continue to see everyone taking to the streets. On November 20th, we'll have a statewide day of action for us to stand up for a Florida for all of us.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Andrea Cristina Mercado, I want to thank you for being with us, executive director of The New Florida Majority.\n\nWhen we come back, one of the many firsts in this midterm election: one of two Muslim women congressmember-elects. We'll be joined by Rashida Tlaib from Detroit. Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

African-American communities and people of color on the frontlines in South Carolina have been fighting for justice in the face of extreme environmental racism for years. We host a roundtable with local leaders and environmental justice advocates to talk about the significance of the event, the issues their communities face and the 2020 candidates' platforms on environmental justice. Gilda Cobb-Hunter, president of the National Black Caucus of State Legislators, Melanie Campbell, president of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation and Mustafa Ali, former head of the EPA's Environmental Justice Program, join us in Orangeburg.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman. We're broadcasting from South Carolina State University, here in Orangeburg, where tonight, on this very stage, the first-ever Presidential Forum on Environmental Justice will be held. Democracy Now! will be broadcasting and live-streaming beginning at 6 p.m. Eastern. I'll be co-moderating with former EPA official Mustafa Ali, who is still with us, a former EPA official, formerly with the Hip Hop Caucus, now vice president of the National Wildlife Fund. And we're joined by South Carolina state Representative Gilda Cobb-Hunter, who represents the city of Orangeburg in South Carolina. She's also the president of the National Black Caucus of State Legislators. And Melanie Campbell joins us, president of the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation and the convener of the Black Women's Roundtable.\n\nWe welcome you all to Democracy Now!\n\nREP . GILDA COBB - HUNTER : Thank you.\n\nMELANIE CAMPBELL : Thank you.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, Representative Cobb-Hunter, you are a first. You're the first woman to represent Orangeburg in the South Carolina state Legislature, and you are representing black state legislators around the country. Talk about why environmental justice is important to you, and why you are hosting tonight's event, tonight's first-ever forum.\n\nREP . GILDA COBB - HUNTER : Well, thanks, Amy, for having us. And we really appreciate the support of Democracy Now!\n\nIt's important to NBCSL for a variety of reasons. We have total dysfunction, in the opinion of state legislators, at the federal level. And so, when we talk about the issue of environmental justice, climate change, all politics is local. And when we can't get action on the federal level, that leaves us as state legislators to make sure that whatever remedies, whatever mitigation is there, that we are in a position to try to get that done. NBCSL , along with the Hispanic Caucus - and we will be joined tonight by the president of the National Hispanic Caucus - what we recognize is that the issue of environmental justice impacts black and brown communities. And so we represent these communities. We think it's important for us not to wait on Congress, not to wait on a president, but for us to use the power we have as state legislators and take action.\n\nAnd I would just echo Mustafa's point. We are very pleased that six of these candidates who want to be president thought this issue was important enough to not just talk the talk, but to walk the walk. And we welcome them to South Carolina's only state-supported historic black college and university at South Carolina State. Welcome to Bulldog Country.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And, Gilda Cobb-Hunter, how does it work in a state legislature around issues of environmental justice? I mean, we know about ALEC , the right-wing organization, that writes legislation, particularly in state legislatures -\n\nREP . GILDA COBB - HUNTER : Yes, yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : - for state legislatures, and one by one, following a trend in the country to cut back on regulations. How do you deal, as the head of the NBCSL , the national caucus of black legislators, in responding?\n\nREP . GILDA COBB - HUNTER : Well, a part of it is what we'll do here tonight. My role as president, in my view, is increasing members' awareness of issues that impact our constituents. We all know the routine issues that all of us care about and all of us are working on. But when it comes to an issue like environmental justice, the awareness of black legislators, in our view, is not what it should be. And so, a part of our goal and a part of what we think is important is increasing our awareness. ALEC has a very strong footprint here in the South Carolina Legislature. They spend money. We have members who are in the national leadership of that organization.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is the American Legislative Exchange Council -\n\nREP . GILDA COBB - HUNTER : Yes, yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : - presenting model legislation.\n\nREP . GILDA COBB - HUNTER : Present - and in some cases, in some states in our group, we've had people who didn't even remove the name ALEC , just kind of came in, dropped it. And so, we've got to be vigilant. And we've got to stay focused on this issue. And so, a part of what I see us needing to do - and that's why this forum is so important, because I'm told from the frontline communities that there has never been this kind of event, which makes it even more appropriate that it's here at South Carolina State. We've got to just - the way you deal with ALEC , I believe, the best way to eat an elephant - pun intended - is one small bite at a time.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And, Mustafa Ali, how do you see ALEC playing out in legislatures around the country?\n\nMUSTAFA ALI : Well, they have a particular view that they're trying to push. And that's why it's so important for us to really educate folks and engage them in the civic process and in the legislative process, so that they understand that they have power and that they can help to frame out. So, environmental justice organizations, public health organizations, civil rights organizations, all coming together to deal with these impacts that are happening inside of our communities, can balance out those who might not necessarily have the best intention for our communities.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Melanie Campbell, you represent the largest voting bloc within the black community, and that's African-American women. Talk about your organization, both the roundtable as well as the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation, and what you're trying to accomplish.\n\nMELANIE CAMPBELL : Well, first of all, thank you, Amy, and thank you to my colleagues here. And it's good to be back on this campus. I was on this campus in 2008 on a rainy day in February working on getting out the vote with our Black Youth Vote! program. And so, it's always good to be back here in Orangeburg; in South Carolina, but haven't been in Orangeburg in a little while. But so, thank you all for the invitation to work with you all on this project.\n\nWell, the national coalition has been around for almost 44 years. It's a coalition of national organizations, not just African-American, but labor and other kinds of civil rights and social justice organizations. Black Women's Roundtable is our women and girls power-building arm, and it's really like the glue for the organization. And I say that because when you talk about the black vote, black women, we're the secret sauce to move the black vote. And that's because of our voting strength and the fact that we influence our families and all of our significant others. So, when you say there's a big surge in the black vote, that's because black women didn't just show up, because we're going to show up, but we're going to also encourage our families and our communities to do that. We also are, many times, leading a lot of the work and becoming more unapologetic about demanding respect for that, whether it's the Democratic Party or progressive community, to understand that we're not just a voting bloc, we are also leaders in this space. This issue around - and so I appreciate Mustafa and - I was going to say \"Congresswoman.\" I'm channeling that.\n\nREP . GILDA COBB - HUNTER : No, please, don't start that.\n\nMELANIE CAMPBELL : Don't start no mess, right?\n\nREP . GILDA COBB - HUNTER : Please, please don't.\n\nMELANIE CAMPBELL : My sister friend Gilda, for what they're doing here. This issue, we see, when it comes to environmental justice, is critical when you talk about issues impacting health and issues impacting economic justice, because of the impact it has on our communities. And so, our young people - who are just a little bit younger than us, right? - who demand that this be a critical issue in this election.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Why is environmental justice so critical, especially for people in the -\n\nMELANIE CAMPBELL : I grew up in Florida. I grew up along the coast of the Atlantic, big, big city called Mims, Florida. And so, growing up around - we knew we had hurricanes, growing up. You know, you didn't have to leave home. My mother passed away three years ago. And we would always have to worry. Now they have to - most of the time, they have to leave. I have a brother that's still there, who, most of the time, he has to get on a plane and fly up there in Virginia and get away. You can't stay anymore, because it's so much - it's very different from what had happened 30 years ago or 40 years ago. What's happening now is real impact in our communities. I can remember growing up where orange groves were beautiful. Everybody had orange groves. It was a part of the economy. If you couldn't - if you didn't have a job, you can go pick oranges and make a living. Right? You can't do that. Those things have been destroyed by the climate change and other kinds of things. Damu Smith - I'm going to channel -\n\nMUSTAFA ALI : Yes, my mentor.\n\nMELANIE CAMPBELL : - was one of my best buddies - right? - who really educated me down in Cancer Alley, Louisiana.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Damu Smith was an early - it's, in fact, where I met him -\n\nMELANIE CAMPBELL : Right. OK, yes, yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : - at one of the first conferences.\n\nMELANIE CAMPBELL : He took us on the bus.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Cancer Alley, Baton Rouge and New Orleans.\n\nMELANIE CAMPBELL : And back in the day, so I've been around this for a while. Connie Tucker, who's another sister. I lived in Atlanta for 20 years. My current sister who keeps me on this is Felicia Davis with HBCU Green Fund, understanding that this issue is not a side issue. It's very much intricately a part of what's dealing with even issues around wealth building and how that impacts our communities.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And do you feel like the candidates are addressing these issues? How do you get them to focus?\n\nMELANIE CAMPBELL : I will say that we are - our Black Youth Vote! young people are having these debate watch parties, and they've been doing these polls. And they look for who they want - who won, which I won't get into that, but they also say what are they not hearing. And environmental justice and climate change are key. They're not the number one, but they're high, like number three or something like that. Consistently, every month, they host these things. And that's what they're telling us. And so, young people are saying - demanding that. And so, the candidates that don't get that are going to miss getting that Generation Z vote and that millennial vote this year.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Representative Gilda Cobb-Hunter, ReGenesis, explain what that project is, because South Carolina is not only ground zero for the problems but also for solutions.\n\nREP . GILDA COBB - HUNTER : Right. And before I talk about ReGenesis, if I could, Amy, just pick up on the point that Melanie made about the young people and what candidates - which candidates are speaking to the vote, to this issue. That's a part of why NBCSL is here sponsoring this event, because we can't afford to wait for the DNC or the RNC to bless this and say, \"OK, we're going have a debate.\" This issue impacts our communities. We thought it important to step up and say, \"You know what? DNC , RNC , y'all don't want to talk about climate change? Guess what. We don't need your permission to talk about climate change. We've got a vehicle that we can use to talk about this issue.\" And it is important that these Democratic candidates understand how this issue resonates with young voters, with progressive voters, with seasoned voters. This is an issue whose time has come, and it's not going away.\n\nThe one candidate that consistently spoke to the issue is no longer in the race, and that's Governor Jay Inslee. All of them do the photo ops. All of them talk the talk. They all have the talking points. But whether or not there's specificity in how they can get it done, which is what ReGenesis is doing here in South Carolina, has done - we've got a lot of people who are academic who talk about environmental justice. But we have in Spartanburg, South Carolina, under the leadership of my former colleague Harold Mitchell, a project called ReGenesis, that has reclaimed and revitalized that entire community. And he's done that in spite of, I would add -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, he got $20,000, EPA environmental justice grant -\n\nREP . GILDA COBB - HUNTER : And leveraged it, yes. Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : -to help clean up these contaminated sites.\n\nREP . GILDA COBB - HUNTER : Yes. Leveraged $20,000 into several million, has a community that has now - that once was a wasteland, that once was the home of a fertilizer plant. He is working -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This was called Devil's Triangle because it was so polluted.\n\nREP . GILDA COBB - HUNTER : Exactly, exactly. And again, what is important to understand is, what we need to be lifting up are people who are on the ground working, not people theorizing about it, not people who are just - well, I'll just say ReGenesis is a project that is the role model. And to pass on just a tidbit I don't think a lot of people know, because heroes are very rarely recognized in their own hometown, ReGenesis and its founder - Harold Mitchell has gone to Taiwan. He is known internationally as, again, somebody who doesn't just talk about it, but who actually does something. And that's the point of the platform that will be the point of your questions and Mustafa's questions tonight to these candidates who are showing up: What are you going to do specifically?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And finally, Mustafa Ali, I mean, you have South Carolina. It's the - you've got the primaries and caucuses first in New Hampshire and in Iowa. These are two of the whitest states.\n\nREP . GILDA COBB - HUNTER : Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And then you have a large African-American community in South Carolina, why this is so significant. I mean, so much attention is paid to the whitest states in this country simply because they're first in the primary system. It means all the candidates are gearing their plans to those states.\n\nMUSTAFA ALI : Well, you can't take our vote for granted.\n\nREP . GILDA COBB - HUNTER : Right.\n\nMUSTAFA ALI : If you want our vote, you better show up. So, it sends a signal to folks. People want to see you and touch you and hear firsthand what you have to share. So, if you are willing to spend time in New Hampshire and in Iowa sitting down with folks, I appreciate that. You need to be in the South. You know that there are folks who are going to vote, and you need to actually solidify that vote by sharing with them the realness of what your vision is. What is your policies? Talk to them about their kitchen table issues and how it's going to be addressed. So, if you are not sitting down with Mrs. Ramirez in her kitchen or Mr. Johnson on his back porch having some conversations, as well, then people may not think that you're as serious as you say you are.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, I want to thank you all for being with us. This is only the beginning, as we, tonight, hold this forum.

The two campaigns appear neck and neck in several battleground states key to winning the White House, but early results suggest Democrats performed worse than they had hoped, setting up a potential legal fight over uncounted ballots reminiscent of the 2000 election. We spend the hour discussing the results and what comes next, with Ben Jealous, president of People for the American Way and former head of the NAACP ; Briahna Joy Gray, formerly the national press secretary for the 2020 Bernie Sanders campaign, and co-host of the \"Bad Faith\" podcast; and The Nation's John Nichols in the battleground state of Wisconsin. \"The tragedy of this election, regardless of what the outcome ends up being, is that it was ever this close at all,\" says Gray. \"The crime here is that the vote is this close.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The Quarantine Report . I'm Amy Goodman in New York. My co-host Juan González at his home in New Brunswick, New Jersey.\n\nThe presidential race between Donald Trump and Joe Biden remains too close to call, with millions of ballots still to be counted in Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, Nevada and other states. Earlier this morning, at around 2:20 a.m. Eastern, President Trump prematurely and falsely claimed victory.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : This is a major fraud on our nation. We want the law to be used in a proper manner. So we'll be going to the U.S. Supreme Court. We want all voting to stop. We don't want them to find any ballots at 4:00 in the morning and add them to the list, OK? It's a very sad - it's a very sad moment. To me, this is a very sad moment. And we will win this. And as far as I'm concerned, we already have won it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Despite the president's charge, no evidence of fraud has emerged in any state. Earlier in the evening, about two hours before, Joe Biden said all votes should be counted.\n\nJOE BIDEN : I'm here to tell you tonight we believe we're on track to win this election. We knew, because of the unprecedented early vote and the mail-in vote, that it's going to take a while. We're going to have to be patient, until the hard work of tallying the votes is finished. And it ain't over 'til every vote is counted, every ballot is counted.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Across the country, over 101 million people cast early votes, either in person or by mail, shattering all previous records. Many of those votes have not yet been counted in some states.\n\nAt the time of broadcast, Biden is leading by small margins in Wisconsin and Nevada. In Michigan, Trump is leading by just 13,000 votes. Trump has a large lead in Pennsylvania, but many votes from Philadelphia have not yet been counted, as well as surrounding areas throughout the state. Trump is also leading in Georgia and North Carolina, but both states remain too close to call.\n\nWe begin our show with Ben Jealous, president of People for the American Way, former president of the NAACP . His op-ed was published in USA Today . It's headlined \"Election chaos: keep calm, keep counting, and get to work.\"\n\nAnd we're joined by Briahna Joy Gray, former national press secretary for Bernie Sanders 2020. She's the co-host of the Bad Faith podcast and contributing editor to Current Affairs . She tweeted through the night, so we were fortunate to be able to talk to her today, because she tweeted right through this morning.\n\nBen Jealous, we're beginning with you. \"Election chaos: keep calm, keep counting, and get to work.\" Respond to what President Trump says. He declared victory and called the elections a \"fraud.\"\n\nBEN JEALOUS : I mean, Trump is a fraud. Let's be clear here: We have reason to be very, very hopeful. Joe has won every single state that was won in 2016 by Ms. Clinton. He has also won Nebraska. He's won Arizona. And there's huge buckets of votes to be counted in urban areas - Pittsburgh, Philly, Milwaukee, Detroit, Atlanta. It's not just that there's votes that are left to be counted in these states. A lot of the little areas have come in, but the big urban areas, there's huge buckets of votes to be counted.\n\nSo, Trump did what we expected him to do, which was to try to perpetrate this fraud on the people of our country that he had won when he has not. And I would say to my fellow Dems and folks who voted against Trump, folks who voted for Biden, just keep calm. We've got this. We've always known that we would have to wait for every vote to be counted. We're just going to have to keep calm and count every vote.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, let's talk about one of the first states that was called last night, and that was Florida. Now, we know that many thousands, if not over a million, votes - this is before the election, well before, when you talk about voter suppression, who got to vote and who didn't initially. If you can talk about what you see happened in Florida, and particularly talk about the Latinx vote? It definitely didn't come out for Biden and Harris in the way the Democrats had predicted.\n\nBEN JEALOUS : When you dig into what's going on with the Latinx vote in Florida, you've got to acknowledge a couple of things. One is that Donald Trump heavily outspent Joe Biden in advertising on Spanish-language media targeting Latinx swing voters all across the country. Last time I checked, it was 10 to one. At People For, one of the things that we tried to do was to make up for that gap. And we found ourselves scrambling, trying to get dollars for, for instance, even statewide radio in Florida. So there was just a failure over the summer to really court Latinx voters, especially those who speak Spanish as their main language.\n\nThe second problem was, frankly, one of relationship. If you talk to folks in the Venezuelan community, which is critical to winning South Florida, where Joe did not perform as well as he did throughout the state, it's kind of insane, because Trump and Pence, from a policy perspective, have great antipathy for what that community wants, and yet the leaders will say, \"But we know them. You know, Pence made dozens of trips down here. Democrats just made a few at that point.\" And so, you know, you've got to kind of give it to Trump that, from a marketing perspective, they've done a very good job of marketing themselves to Latinx voters in southern Florida, despite the fact that they have Latinx children in cages on the border and, quite frankly, their policy interests are not in line even with folks like in the Venezuelan community, you know, whose leaders were very supportive of them because they felt like they had a relationship.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to bring Briahna Joy Gray into this conversation, again, former national press secretary for Bernie Sanders. Talk about your response as you saw the way things were unfolding, what you predicted, what you're seeing now. In a moment, we're going to be speaking with Erika Andiola in Arizona. It may well be this Republican state was flipped. Fascinatingly, it was Fox that first called it, to the ire of President Trump. CNN has yet to call it. But you have Arizona, that looks like it has been won by Biden, but you have the very close races in Georgia, in North Carolina, in Michigan, in Florida, in Pennsylvania. I mean, could you imagine what would happen if there wasn't a pandemic?\n\nBRIAHNA JOY GRAY : Yeah, the tragedy of this election, regardless of what the outcome ends up being, is that it was ever this close at all. For months, for years, Democrats have accurately described Trump as a pox on the country, as someone who has undermined every norm, who has caused a great deal of hardship on specifically, historically marginalized communities, and someone who has done little, little at all, to stem off the worst effects of this global health pandemic, from a health perspective and from an economic perspective. And yet here we are.\n\nAnd I think when you start to dig a little deeper, you see what's going on. This was an election in which the Democratic Party was very clear to put neoliberalism on the ballot. Donald Trump - you know, Joe Biden was a candidate who bragged to his donors that nothing would fundamentally change. He ran, clearly, with the plan to marginalize the left and to be very clear about the fact that he didn't feel like he needed to reach out and do that kind of outreach.\n\nAnd specifically, he failed in the ways that Bernie Sanders really excelled when it came to Latino voters. And what you saw in Florida is not just that they were outspent, but that Donald Trump was up on the airwaves with Spanish-language ads a full month before Joe Biden got into the state. Choices were made about when to invest and to what degree. And those choices ignored, perhaps fatally ignored, the extent to which the Latino vote is not guaranteed, and it has to absolutely be earned by building a relationship of trust over time.\n\nAnd when you look at Nevada, one of the reasons why Joe Biden has done much better in terms of the Latino vote there is because he got there earlier and spent more money in the state. And also, there's some reporting out of The Intercept that he was helped there by the fact that marijuana legalization was on the ballot, and that might have turned out more voters.\n\nSo we're seeing some arguable correlation between pushing progressive policies and, of course, investing in communities in states going toward Democrats. And I think that we need to really think critically about how successful this \"nothing will fundamentally change\" message ultimately will be for the Democratic Party in the long run.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Ben Jealous, your response?\n\nBEN JEALOUS : Well, I think all of that was spot on. I think all of that was spot on. You know, our party has to, frankly, learn from the Trump campaign as far as we have to market to every single voter. The way that they went after young Black men, just trying to pull off 3, 4%, we should have gone after with the intention of getting 95%. The way that they went after the Latinx community, trying to get to 40%, we should have gone after, trying to get to 80%. We've got to stop taking this kind of machine boss approach where you're just asking, \"Are you winning a particular community?\" And you've got to start seeing the people of this country as individuals, and you have to fight for every single one of their votes.\n\nAnd so, I do believe that we're going to win. It should not be this close. Right now we just got to keep calm, count every vote, push hard. And we have to push against the disinformation that is coming straight out of the White House and the mouth of the president of United States, who took to the television at 2 a.m. to lie to the American people.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And, Briahna, your response to what Trump said? I mean, secretaries of state, both Republican and Democrat, have repeatedly warned - they're the ones in charge of state elections - have repeatedly warned that they have to be able to have time to vote - to count that vote. And yet President Trump, while he wants every vote counted in Arizona - right? - because right now Biden is ahead - Fox called it, CNN didn't call it. Mark Kelly, the Democrat, has beaten the sitting senator, Martha McSally, in a special election. She had - that's in Arizona. He wants every vote counted there, but in Pennsylvania, where he has repeatedly gone after absentee ballots, calling them fraudulent, he wants the voting stopped. And interestingly, he said this is going to go to the Supreme Court. Like, forget the other courts that lead up to the Supreme Court. He's taking this - his suggestion was - to his court.\n\nBRIAHNA JOY GRAY : Yeah. I mean, look, this was the game plan that a lot of very sensible folks warned about, right? Bernie Sanders predicted this almost word for word on the Late Night show earlier this week, right? And that's part of why it's so frustrating that this race was close to begin with, because as I also predicted on Bad Faith podcast, I said if this is a landslide, if Biden clearly wins and can declare victory and can claim victory on Tuesday or Wednesday morning, then we are in good shape. But if there's any ambiguity here, we're at real risk that Donald Trump will try to railroad through a result of his liking, because the reality is - and I think that Trump and the Republicans recognize - that they are a lot better at these kind of strategic fights. It's not that they're fair. It's not that they're legal. But Republicans are willing to scrape and fight for every advantage in a way that, as we just saw in the Amy Coney Barrett debacle, Democrats simply are not. And in a situation like this where there is an ability to create ambiguity, even if there isn't in fact ambiguity, it's hard for me to imagine the steps that Democrats will take to prevent this from, yes, going to a favorable court for Donald Trump and for this being a redux of the year 2000 and the 2000 election, after which, I would like to point out, electoral reforms were not put into place.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, let's talk, Ben Jealous, about the position of Biden. And as you said, this race is way too early to call. And I want to talk about the kind of organizing that you have been doing. If President Trump refuses to accept the counting of the ballots - it's been amazing over the last few days to see that wall go up around the White House. First it was - you know, first it was wire, and then it was a wall, preparing, not clear exactly, for what. And I should say yesterday he had hundreds of people in the White House starting at 7:00 in the evening, again, the issue of the White House becoming a super hot spot, a superspreading event in itself. And they stayed until well after 2:00 in the morning, when he gave his speech to cheers as he talked about his victory and the fraudulent election.\n\nBut I wanted to go to the issues of Joe Biden - you also - you ran for governor of Maryland - and the kinds of issues that you represented and the kind of issues that Biden really stayed away from. That's the issue of Medicare for All. Joe Biden said he would veto it if it came to his desk, if he was president. I mean, if it came to his desk, that would mean that Republicans and Democrats would have had to have endorsed it. The issue of a Green New Deal, clear that he was not endorsing a Green New Deal, and also that whole issue of fracking, that he once said he was against and then said - once said he was against and then said he was for. But do you think, rather than adopting a progressive position that would mobilize voters - it's not that progressives don't have somewhere else to go, especially when it comes to Trump. They can just decide not to vote.\n\nBEN JEALOUS : You know, Joe Biden played his playbook. It looks like it's going to win the presidency for him. With that said, the playbook of the party has to shift. The party has to run towards the people of the country, has to run towards its base. Kamala, quite frankly, has much more of that in her. I've known her for years. And that has to be the future of the party, is to actually fight for every single vote, to be clear to working-class men of all colors that we have a vision for your economic prosperity, because right now you're seeing Trump get more men of every color than he should. And it's a real appeal to patriarchy. And you've got to replace that, frankly, with a strategy for how you're actually going to shore up people economically, because when they're falling for the floor, they'll grasp for anything, including outmoded ways of being.\n\nWe have to really fight for every Latinx vote. We've got to fight for every Black vote. We've got to fight for every young person's vote. And that means that we have to be a party that is unabashed about pushing for a vision that actually saves the planet, provides healthcare for everybody and, again, provides a pathway to economic success for everyone in the country. We're supposed to be the party of FDR .\n\nNow, I'm hopeful. I am hopeful that Joe Biden can be that president, even if he wasn't that candidate. What that's going to require is for us as a movement to push him to his better angels. And so, we're going to count every vote. We're going to be optimistic in this moment. Joe Biden will win. And then we will push him as hard - you know, as FDR said himself, \"I agree with what you say. Go make me do it.\" We're going to have to go make Joe do a bunch of things that our children, born and yet unborn, need us to do in order to secure a better future for this country and our planet.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to bring in another guest. And I also want to say Juan González was co-hosting today, but because we are living in these pandemic times, we are socially distanced, and he's having a problem with his computer. But I wanted to bring in John Nichols, who is currently in Madison, Wisconsin. The presidential race between Donald Trump and Joe Biden remains too close to call, as we've said throughout this show, where we are broadcasting this in the morning of the day after the election, ballots still being counted in Michigan, in Wisconsin, in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia and Nevada and other states. Biden is leading in Wisconsin by just over 20,000 votes, as we broadcast, with an estimated 97% of votes reported. In Michigan, Trump is leading narrowly by 24,000 votes, but the heavily Democratic city of Detroit is expected to take until, well, sometime tonight, possibly, to complete its count of absentee ballots. And then you've got Grand Rapids and other places. Their ballots have not fully been counted. But we're going now to Wisconsin, where we're joined by John Nichols. He's The Nation magazine's national affairs correspondent and host of the podcast Next Left . His most recent book, The Fight for the Soul of the Democratic Party .\n\nJohn, talk about what's happening in Wisconsin right now. Before we were speaking, the margin was much tighter. It's increased a bit to 20,000, with Joe Biden ahead. But talk about what's been counted, what hasn't, and what your assessment is of what's happening in Wisconsin.\n\nJOHN NICHOLS : Well, thanks for having me on, Amy.\n\nAnd what a night it has been. I can tell you that as I look around Wisconsin - and I just got off the phone with some key players around the state and party folks and local officials, who all were up through the night - it does look - and again, we'll see what scattering may be out there - it looks like Joe Biden has a sufficient lead to win Wisconsin. I know that 21,000 votes seems like a very small margin, but you should understand that it is almost twice what John Kerry won the state by in 2004 and almost four times what Al Gore won the state by in 2000. And so, the fact of the matter is, Wisconsin is [inaudible] battleground state. And when I look around the state right now, it appears that the key places have reported. And what happened [inaudible] night was that, early on, Trump had a quite substantial lead. And in many ways, the reporting on that went to the heart of the problem with how media covers election night, because it was reporting from more rural areas and from more suburban areas. It takes longer to count a lot of votes in a big city. And so, Milwaukee took 'til around 4 a.m. When [inaudible] came in, it -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : John, we're losing you a little bit. Your Skype is going in and out, so if you could repeat what you just said about Milwaukee?\n\nJOHN NICHOLS : Sure. I apologize. When Milwaukee came in, it provided -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We may just have to go to audio for you, but go - we're going to go to break. We're going to try to fix this, even if we just get you on audio, because this is absolutely critical, what's happening in Wisconsin. John Nichols, The Nation 's national affairs correspondent, host of the podcast Next Left . We're also talking to Ben Jealous, who's now head of People for the American Way and has a USA Today op-ed , an editorial, \"Election chaos: keep calm, keep counting, and get to work,\" as well as Briahna Joy Gray, former national press secretary for Bernie Sanders 2020. Stay with us.\n\n[break]\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That's Nina Simone, \"How Long Must I Wander?\" This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The Quarantine Report . I'm Amy Goodman, as we talk about this day after Election Day, the day that so many around the country have warned, especially secretaries of state, we will not necessarily know who won the race for president, not to mention many senatorial races, congressional races, that the ballots must be counted, the ballots that were cast on Election Day and the ones that were cast early. I mean, there was a record-shattering number, 101 - more than 101 million people cast votes early in this 2020 election, either an absentee ballot or early in-person voting. And those, all those votes, must count. Many races are still in contention. Some have been called.\n\nOur guests are Ben Jealous, president of People for the American Way, former head of the NAACP and formerly ran for governor of Maryland. We're also joined by Briahna Joy Gray, former national press secretary for Bernie Sanders 2020. John Nichols is The Nation 's national affairs correspondent and host of the podcast Next Left . His most recent book is The Fight for the Soul of the Democratic Party .\n\nBriahna Joy Gray, if you can talk about - I asked Ben about this earlier - but about the kind of organizing that's going on right now, with - you have President Trump announcing he's won and that these elections are fraudulent if the states do not announce for him. He wants every vote counted in Arizona, where Fox and other news outlets, including AP, have called it for Joe Biden. But in Pennsylvania, he wants these absentee ballots, the voting count to stop. Talk about the organizing before the election to get people to vote, and what's happening now, and what you want - how you want to see the Democratic Party respond.\n\nBRIAHNA JOY GRAY : I'm glad you ask that question, because I think the real story here is the extent to which certain really key demographics, who truly comprise the Democratic Party base, were completely either ignored or undervalued, or those votes were assumed and not actually earned, right? So there was a lot of talk about the importance of Black and Latino voters during the primary. That very quickly dissipated in the general, when it became assumed that because Donald Trump is a racist who has backed a number of policies that disproportionately heap harm on those groups, that those votes would automatically come over to Joe Biden. But as you pointed out earlier, people can and do stay home. So, in fact, exit polls show that Donald Trump did better with every demographic group except for white men. He's down five with white men, up two with white women, up four with both Black men and Black women, and up three with both Latino men and Latinas. And that's something that people are going to have to deal with.\n\nNow, my former colleague Akela Lacy at The Intercept came out with a video earlier this week in which she interviewed and profiled voters in Philadelphia, and these were predominantly Black voters. Several of the men that were spoken to said, \"No, I'm not going to vote for Joe Biden, because it was his policies from the 1990s that resulted in so many of my friends and families wasting their lives in jail, and they can't get that time back.\" There were other Black voters that she spoke to who sighed in a kind of resigned fashion that said, \"Yes, I'm going to vote for Joe Biden, but I'm not enthusiastic about it.\"\n\nSo, again, the crime here is that the vote is this close. And while Democrats are looking hopefully to the returns from these major urban areas that are Blacker and, you know, supposedly more Democrat than the rest of the state, it remains to be seen whether or not Joe Biden did enough to demonstrate that Black voters, faithfully voting for Democrats in 90-plus percent numbers for the last 50 years, has resulted in a sufficient return on that investment that they're going to do so again this time around.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to go to John Nichols in Madison, Wisconsin. John, I think we'll be able to hear you better on the telephone. So, if you can explain what's happening in Milwaukee, what's happening in Green Bay, where President Trump spent a lot of time? And the votes, at this point about 20,000 apart, it's a very close race, but Joe Biden does seem to be ahead.\n\nJOHN NICHOLS : [inaudible] Looks like a very, very narrow margin, but it's important to understand that Donald Trump only won the state by around 22,000 votes four years ago. And of the last six elections in Wisconsin, four of them have been decided, or look to have been decided, by under 25,000 votes. So this is what happens in Wisconsin.\n\nAnd the fact of the matter is, a lot of our media covered Wisconsin last night terribly, because they were looking at those early results and really underestimating what was still out and where it was still out. You have to wait for the ballots to be counted. When the ballots were counted in Milwaukee - and that count finished around 4 a.m. - they brought in a better part of 150,000 additional votes for Joe Biden. That closed the gap dramatically. And then - that actually put Biden a little bit ahead - when Green Bay came in, closer to 5 a.m., that put Biden up by roughly 11,000 votes.\n\nAnd amazingly enough, Kenosha, the city of Kenosha, where Donald Trump did his last campaign stop on the eve of the election, clearly intending to exploit the story of what had happened in Kenosha in August with the shooting seven times in the back by a police officer of Jacob Blake, and then, a few days later, the shooting of two protesters by an armed white vigilante on the streets - Trump was trying to exploit that, but in the end, Kenosha produced another almost 10,000 votes for Joe Biden.\n\nWhat we're looking at right now is a circumstance where Biden has a lead. The vote appears to have been - to be overwhelmingly in. It doesn't look like there's anything substantial out. And Wisconsin has never had a recount where you overturned 20,000 votes. That's never happened. And so, when I spoke this morning to the chairman of the Democratic Party in Wisconsin, Ben Wikler, he was feeling actually very confident.\n\nAnd if I can add one final thing here, coming off what my friends have just said moments ago, this gets to the heart of the matter. At about 4:00 yesterday afternoon, folks and activists got the word that their Milwaukee vote was not sufficient, or it didn't look that the turnout was sufficient. And a massive final push was put on in the last four hours, using social media and everything they had. All this focus went on Milwaukee. And the truth of the matter is that they, very possibly, activists and some Democratic Party folks, really put Biden over the top in literally the last hours.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, I want to say that as we're broadcasting this, in Michigan, 64% of the vote has been counted in Wayne County, which includes - it's the largest county in Michigan, and it includes Detroit. It's a very close race there, gone down from President Trump being hundreds of thousands of votes ahead to now thousands of votes ahead. He has 49.4% of the vote to Biden's 48.9. Georgia, 8% of the vote remains to be counted. Overall in Michigan, 14% of the vote remains to be counted. In Pennsylvania, 25%, a quarter of the vote, remains to be counted. Briahna, I wanted to ask you about media coverage, of how serious - of what they value and what they don't, especially in the corporate media, raising issues of concern like the Latinx population and the African American population not responding as much to Biden's message.\n\nBRIAHNA JOY GRAY : Yeah. Well, the corporate media lied to Americans about what electability entailed. And principally, that is that in the primary, by pretending as though the 13% of voters in South Carolina that participated in the primary were a good bellwether for how various groups of people of color across the country would vote, particularly in the states that are actually game changers on election night, like South Carolina. So, the fact that Bernie Sanders was consistently winning 70% of the Latino vote was erased, and the \"Bernie bro\" mythology persisted. From the beginning, in Iowa, it has a small nonwhite population - it's 10% - but Bernie Sanders dominated there, because the campaign invested early and thought it was important to station campaign workers outside of meatpacking plants who spoke Amharic, who could communicate to the various communities that were living there. Despite all of the coverage and back-and-forth about the culinary workers and the so-called abuse that they were receiving from Bernie supporters, they broke with leadership, and those predominantly Latino workers supported Bernie Sanders overwhelmingly, and he won 70% of the vote in Nevada. And when that happened, you had media figures like Soledad O'Brien saying, \"Well, I'll wait and see what happens when nonwhite states vote\" - right? - when diverse states vote, completely erasing any voters of color that weren't Black. And now we're seeing what's happening.\n\nOne other aspect of this was the narrative about Florida and how Bernie Sanders couldn't possibly win there because of the socialism smear and how that was going to affect more conservative Latino communities. Well, look what's happened. That smear was still applied and appears to have stuck, to some degree, to Joe Biden. But what you don't have is the positive ability to run on incredibly popular programs like Medicare for All and student debt cancellation and a more progressive immigration platform than Joe Biden had. And so, it looks as though Joe Biden's strategy to get this, you know, defector Republican did not work. There weren't enough of these moderate Republicans to go after. And who knows how many genuine progressives or working-class people, who simply needed material uplift that could have been delivered by these progressive policies - who knows how many of them could have come over to our side?\n\nAnd one last point, if you look at the fact that Florida passed a $15 minimum wage raise but didn't vote for Joe Biden, you see there the gap between the politician and the policy, and what might have been able to be achieved if Joe Biden had in fact allowed himself to be pushed left in a way that he wasn't. Even during - in the midst of the biggest protest in American history, he didn't budge. So, the work of activists is really made for them.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to read a statement from Biden campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon, who said, \"The president's statement tonight about trying to shut down the counting of duly cast ballots was outrageous, unprecedented, and incorrect. ... Having encouraged Republican efforts in multiple states to prevent the legal counting of these ballots before Election Day, now Donald Trump is saying these ballots can't be counted after Election Day either.\" That's a statement from Biden campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon.\n\nBen Jealous, finally, where you see what's happening going today? Again, you had the headline of your op-ed in USA Today , \"Election chaos: keep calm, keep counting, and get to work.\" And you know what happened in 2000. You know when the recounting was happening in the Bush v. Gore presidential race in Florida. A group of Republican operatives, posing as grassroots activists, but many of them coming from Washington, stormed the area where the recount was happening and stopped it. And that ultimately threw it into the Supreme Court, which made the decision. And we know that, certainly, Donald Trump knows that route and said very ominously last night, \"I will take this to the Supreme Court,\" not saying -\n\nBEN JEALOUS : Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : - that he was going to take it up to the Supreme Court, but right to the Supreme Court.\n\nBEN JEALOUS : Yeah, look, what we're in the midst of right now is an epic battle between money and people. In our country, those are the two forces. You have folks who organize money and folks who organize people. Donald Trump has installed a far-right-wing justice, a sixth one, pushed by organized money that is very keen on destroying the Affordable Care Act. On the other hand, Joe Biden has organized the American people. He has won the national popular vote. I think he's up more than 2 million at this point. And we've just got to keep calm, because it looks like not only has he won the national popular vote, but he will win the Electoral College vote, too.\n\nWhat every American should be doing right now who's outraged by the president's attempt to steal this election, and the special interests who are pushing him to do that and pushed through Amy Coney Barrett, is to make sure that you're organized. The people can beat money every day, but you have to be organized. There will be protests across this country today in response to the president's outrageous comments last night. If you feel safe being at them, you should be at them. You should sign up with groups, whether it's People For or it's MoveOn or it's the NAACP or Color of Change. We've got to be organized in this moment.\n\nAnd then, once we win - and I do believe we will win - we have to make sure that the national popular vote counts. We have to end this crazy sort of gerrymandering of presidential politics, where entire demographics are treated like they don't count, entire states are treated like they don't count. And the American people, frankly, eyes glaze over when they see - you know, and their faith starts to wane, when they see the popular vote not matter, presidential after presidential after presidential after presidential. So, I would just say, kind of one, two, three. You know, we did step one -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Five seconds.\n\nBEN JEALOUS : We turned out to vote. Step two, make sure every vote is counted. And step three, make sure that every vote matters.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Ben Jealous, I want to thank you for being with us, president of People for the American Way; Briahna Joy Gray, former press secretary for Bernie Sanders, co-host of Bad Faith podcast; and John Nichols of The Nation magazine, speaking to us from Wisconsin.\n\nThat does it for our show.

      "text": "Why Donald Trump won't make major inroads with Black voters\n\nEven with Harris running, nearly one out of five Black voters say they support Trump. But polls can be deceiving\n\nThroughout the 2024 cycle, polling has suggested that Republicans are poised to do extraordinarily well with African Americans.\n\nEven with Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket , nearly one out of five black voters say they support Donald Trump . Younger Black voters seem especially open to casting ballots for the Republican party.\n\nOn its face, this seems like a sea change in Americans' electoral affinities. The last time Republicans put up numbers anywhere near that level with Black voters was in 1976. And given that Black voters currently make up nearly one-quarter of the Democratic base, a scenario where almost 20% of these constituents defected to the other side would be absolutely devastating for the vice-president's electoral prospects.\n\nThe good news for Democrats is that, even if the polls have been genuinely capturing overall Black sentiment in the US, they are unlikely to be accurately predicting the final vote distribution in November.\n\nTo clarify why polls are unlikely to reflect the eventual vote margins for this particular subset of voters, it might be helpful to look at how things typically shake out for third-party candidates.\n\nDuring the 2016 electoral cycle, Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson consistently hovered around 9% of the vote in polling. As the race tightened in the weeks before the election, voters began defecting to one of the top ticket candidates. However, in the week before ballots were cast, he was still polling at more than 6%. Ultimately, he ended up with just over 3% .\n\nIn the 2020 cycle, Green party candidate Howie Hawkins polled at 2% of the national vote six weeks before the election. He ultimately secured roughly one-quarter of 1% of ballots.\n\nIn the current cycle, Robert F Kennedy Jr polled above 10% for most of the race and, at his high point, was more than double that. However, as the race has tightened (we're less than 90 days out), and after Joe Biden dropped out, Kennedy is now polling around 4% . In the end, he'd probably be lucky to get half that many votes in November.\n\nIn short: despite most Americans consistently expressing support for alternatives to the Democratic and Republican nominees, third-party candidates consistently underperform at the ballot box relative to their polling - even in cycles (like 2016) where unusually high numbers of voters dislike both major party candidates.\n\nOne of the primary causes of this gap between polling and outcomes is that contests are ultimately decided by who shows up to vote on election day. And Americans who are disgusted with both major-party nominees often find other things to do on a Tuesday afternoon than standing in line at a polling place to cast a ballot for someone who has little prospect of actually winning. And when these voters do show up at the ballot box, it's often to hold their nose and vote for whomever they perceive to be the lesser of the two major party evils , in order to deny victory to the candidate they least prefer. And so, in the end, few Americans who express support for third-party candidates in polls actually show up to vote for them. The polls may accurately capture Americans' preferences for third-party candidates, but they don't predict well voting behavior with respect to those candidates.\n\nA similar tale holds for Black support of Republicans.\n\nAlthough polls this cycle have consistently found that nearly one in five Black Americans are open to voting for Trump, they also show that most Black voters could be easily swayed to vote for someone other than who they're leaning towards at the moment, most Black voters have much weaker commitments to their current candidate of choice than other Americans, and roughly a third say they will probably not vote at all. This pattern in responses is also reflected in historical voting behavior: Black voters are more likely than most other Americans to sit elections out .\n\nAcross the board, the Americans who are most likely to show up on election day - highly-educated, relatively affluent, urban and suburban voters - now tend to favor Democrats , even as lower-propensity voters (younger, working class and low-income, and/or less educated Americans, especially those who live in small towns and rural areas) have been shifting to the right .\n\nHistorically, the dynamic has gone the other way. Democrats benefitted from high turnout and sought to expand access and participation while Republicans aggressively sought to suppress turnout by increasing voting restrictions , purging voter rolls , gerrymandering districts and otherwise undermining the Voting Rights Act. However, as the Democratic party was reoriented around knowledge economy professionals, many other constituencies swung in the other direction . And because there are far more \"normie\" voters than there are symbolic capitalists , high turnout increasingly came to favor Republicans instead.\n\nThis matters because Republicans' polling gains among African Americans are concentrated most heavily among lower-propensity voting blocs (such as younger and less affluent or educated constituents) and, as a consequence, the lower overall electoral turnout is, the more we should expect to see Republicans underperform among black voters relative to the polls.\n\nIn 2020, the GOP got a bigger share of the black vote than in previous cycles, but this was in part because of record turnout among non-white voters (whereas Democrats overperformed in subsequent special elections that had much lower overall turnout). Unfortunately for Trump, there are signs that African American turnout this cycle may be significantly lower among lower-propensity voters. Consequently, the vote share Republicans ultimately receive in 2024 among black voters may end up being significantly lower than the polling suggests.\n\nThe bad news for Democrats is that Trump doesn't necessarily need to get around 20% of the black vote to freeze Kamala out of the White House. If he's to even marginally exceed his numbers from last cycle, Democrats would be left with a highly precarious path to victory unless they can make up the losses with other constituents in swing states.\n\nSince 2010, Democrats had been consistently losing vote share among African Americans in every midterm and general election.\n\nAnd it wasn't just African American voters who were leaving, but also Hispanic Americans, religious minorities, and less affluent or educated voters. The very populations that Democrats often fancy themselves as representatives of and advocates for. The very constituents that were supposed to ensure Democrats an indefinite electoral majority .\n\nThese defections were highly consequential: they contributed to enormous congressional wipeouts from 2010 to 2014 and cost Democrats the White House in 2016 (as Black voter attrition helped flip states including Georgia, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio, even as Hispanic alienation helped tilt Arizona, Texas and Florida toward the Republicans).\n\nMany assumed that with Trump in the White House, minority voters would come flocking back to the Democratic party. Instead, the GOP held their margins with non-white voters in the 2018 midterms. Democratic gains in that election were near-exclusively due to shifts among highly-educated, relatively affluent, urban and suburban white people.\n\nIn 2020, Black voters in states such as South Carolina helped save Biden's floundering primary election campaign. In response, the president vowed to appoint a Black woman as his running mate should he win the Democratic nomination. Upon securing the vote, he ultimately settled on Harris.\n\nThis choice was striking because Harris was not popular with Black voters during the primary. She typically trailed behind not just Biden, but also Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and sometimes other competitors as well - consistently polling about 5% with African Americans.\n\nThat general sentiment seems to have continued through to the general election. Although Harris's nomination was historic in virtue of her being potentially the first Black, female and/or Asian vice-president, her appearance on the ticket generated little enthusiasm among any of these voter blocs. Democrats ultimately got a smaller share of the black vote and the Asian vote in 2020 as compared with 2016 (across gender lines). Democrats were able to nonetheless carve out a narrow electoral college win primarily because white men (especially self-identified \"moderates\" and \"independents\" ) shifted away from Donald Trump in 2020.\n\nThese patterns continued through the 2022 midterm elections : non-white people, including non-white women, shifted much further towards the GOP than white people (especially white men). And it seems likely that Democrats will see further attrition in 2024, even if it's less than current polling suggests.\n\nContrary to optimistic narratives that circulated as Obama was ushered into office, it's actually quite difficult to hold together a coalition that is centered around knowledge economy professionals but attractive to less advantaged Americans as well.\n\nWith respect to the Democratic party's current core constituency, although knowledge economy professionals have been straying from the Democrats since the election of Biden, they seem poised to turn out in force for Harris. The record-breaking \" White Women: Answer the Call \" and \" White Dudes for Harris \" online events seem like a strong indicator - as does the huge outpouring of support from Wall Street , Silicon Valley and big law . The symbolic professions seem to be 100% coconut-pilled.\n\nBlack people, on the other hand, seem much less enthusiastic . And should Harris lean heavily into her race or gender in an attempt to rally support - although this might be appealing to (disproportionately white) knowledge economy professionals - it would likely alienate non-white \"normie\" voters even more (who tend to prefer messages that are less identitarian and more focused on bread and butter issues).\n\nThe big question for 2024 is whether or not Trump will continue to alienate white people at an equal or greater clip as Democrats are driving away voters of color. The answer will likely determine control of the White House.\n\nMusa al-Gharbi is a sociologist in the School of Communication and Journalism at Stony Brook University.

      "text": "Are Black voters abandoning the Democratic party?\n\nPolls that show Kamala Harris losing Black support have Democrats in a panic. The reality is more complicated\n\nA re Black voters gravitating towards Donald Trump in meaningful numbers? Recent polls and articles, most notably the New York Times/Siena College poll , have set off alarm bells across the country with their survey results finding the former president garnering historic levels of support among African American voters.\n\nThe short answer is no, there is little credible evidence showing a meaningful shift in the levels of support Black voters give to Democrats . The longer answer is that the current chorus of media concern illuminates serious shortcomings in polling methodology, political interpretation of polling data, and the responsible communication of information to the public in an ostensible democracy.\n\nGround zero for the latest round of articles and commentary is the 6 October New York Times/Siena College polling that found Kamala Harris attracting support from just 78% of Black voters. By contrast, the 2020 exit polls found that four years ago the Biden-Harris ticket was backed by 87% of African Americans. These recent poll results have spawned lengthy articles, extended podcast discussions and widespread water cooler conversation about just what's going on with Black voters.\n\nThere are four fundamental problems with relying on this single poll's findings.\n\nFirst, the poll's findings are contradicted by other contemporary polls sponsored by major news organizations. In the CBS News/YouGov poll conducted the week after the Times poll, Harris is backed by 87% of Black voters. NBC's latest poll, concluded 8 October, pegs Harris's Black number at 84%. The 8 October ABC News/Ipsos poll has Harris's Black support at 82%.\n\nSecond, there is a glaring methodological anomaly buried in the underlying data that raises serious questions about the cultural competence of those conducting the poll. When I was writing my first book Brown is the New White, I was guided by the data scientist Dr Julie Martinez-Ortega, who helped me grapple with the elemental, but actually quite complicated, question of which people in the population you include in the category of African Americans. The Census Bureau has two designations: \"Black Alone\" and \"Black in Combination\". Martinez-Ortega schooled me to ignore the \"in combination\" grouping as it would yield a distorted picture of the Black population.\n\nUnfortunately, it appears that the New York Times received no such guidance, and their polling data includes truly astounding findings about the differences between Black Alone and Black in Combination. Among the Black Alone population, Harris receives the support of 80% of that group, but the Times finds that just 60% of the Black In Combination grouping supports Harris. Such a dramatic divergence of results from subsets of what are supposedly the same sector of the population raise profound questions about the entire data set.\n\nWhich leads to the third problem: the lack of common sense. Good scientists look at the data they gather and then step back and try to make sense of it all. If a subset of data falls outside of the realm of decades of prior empirical findings, then one has to ask some basic questions.\n\nIs there a dramatic difference in the electoral behavior of African Americans and mixed-race Black people? Given that no Democratic presidential nominee has ever received less than 83% of the Black vote, how likely is it that Harris - a Black woman (and also an Asian woman) - is backed by a smaller share of the Black population than Michael Dukakis, John Kerry and a plethora of more mainstream Democratic presidential nominees? How do you reconcile these findings with the demonstrable and quantifiable Black enthusiasm for Harris in the form of the early Zoom calls that engaged tens of thousands of African Americans in a mere matter of hours; the 10,000 people who turned out to the early rally in heavily Black Atlanta, Georgia; and the historic fundraising numbers that have recently eclipsed $1bn? Which set of information is the outlier?\n\nTied to the lack of common sense is the fourth problem: insufficient cultural competence. If someone who had deep and extensive experience with African Americans looked at the polling data, they could quickly spot the glaring anomalies. Black mixed-race people aren't dramatically more pro-Republican than other African Americans. The enthusiasm and excitement demonstrated in the early Zoom calls flow from enduring a lifetime of disrespect and discrimination, and that excitement of finally having someone who shares your cultural experience in the White House isn't going to dissipate over a few weeks.\n\nNow, to be sure, there are differences in Black voting behavior along gender lines. The most apt example to Harris's situation occurred in Georgia when Stacey Abrams, an African American woman, won the Democratic nomination for governor. In both of Abrams's runs, there was a nine-point difference between her support margins from Black women and Black men (97% from Black women in 2018 and 88% from Black men). And cultural competence and common sense would not find this surprising as sexism is embedded in the fabric of this nation and affects all racial groups.\n\nBut even in Abrams's case the vast, vast majority of African Americans backed the Black woman's bid, and the pertinent and reliable data suggests that a similar phenomenon is unfolding in the 2024 presidential race. The overwhelming majority of Black Americans voted for Democrats in 2020 and in the 2022 midterms (86% according to the exit polls). That enthusiasm is only amplified for Harris.\n\nSteve Phillips is the founder of Democracy in Color, and author of Brown Is the New White: How the Demographic Revolution Has Created a New American Majority and How We Win the Civil War: Securing a Multiracial Democracy and Ending White Supremacy for Good"

Still, election results are shaped by white voters, despite their eligible voter population increasing in that time by less than 3%.\n\nWhite people in 2020 accounted for 67.6% of eligible voters, but they made up 75.1% of the share of voters who cast a ballot due to higher turnout, resulting in overrepresentation among actual voters.\n\n\"We know that disparities in turnout by race and ethnicity are entrenched in our electoral system,\" Mindy Romero, the lead author of the report and director of the center for inclusive democracy at the University of Southern California, said.\n\nVoter turnout among Black Americans is higher compared with that of other racial groups, and in the 2012 presidential election, Black turnout surpassed white turnout for the first time.\n\n\"Who's on the ballot matters,\" Romero said.\n\nTurnout differences when Barack Obama was running for president may reflect how Black voters care more when Black candidates are on the ballot. But between midterm elections, the share of Black people who voted dropped as registration rose, according to the report .\n\nThe year 2020 saw a record number of 154.6 million people turn out for the presidential election, and people of color made up a substantial share of the voters. People of color, especially Black voters, play a pivotal role in the outcomes of presidential elections, but their participation in midterms is notably declining.\n\nNearly 40% of eligible Black voters cast a ballot in the 2018 midterm election, but that number fell to 32.2% in 2022. At the same time, voter registration among Latinos and Asian Americans went up, though this did not result in increased voting during midterms.\n\n\"Black voters can vote in really high numbers, but they still face challenges to turnout, and we see those disparities at play now,\" Romero said.\n\nWhile Black people are projected to account for 14% of eligible voters in the upcoming presidential election, there are significant barriers they face in taking part in the voting process.\n\nMississippi has the largest share of Black voters, at 37%, followed by Georgia, a swing state, where they make up a third of eligible voters. But stringent voter ID laws, aggressive gerrymandering and harsher sentences for errors in voter registration in states like those are some of the barriers for Black voters in casting a ballot.\n\n\"There's outright voter-suppression efforts still happening in the US,\" Romero said.\n\nElection reform and persistent outreach are effective ways to reach millions of eligible non-voters of color ahead of the 2024 elections, she added, saying: \"Mobilization efforts, funding and support for voting and targeting education all make a difference for the Black vote as it does for other groups, too.\""

A majority of Black residents of the biggest city in the most closely contested county of the battleground state of Michigan simply don't vote.\n\nTo the frustration of civil rights activists and Democratic politicians struggling to secure every ballot in a state that the Harris campaign sees as crucial to victory, more than half of Saginaw city's population has long been unpersuaded that elections make much of a difference to their lives.\n\nNow, against the backdrop of the drama of the US's knife-edge 2024 election, Black organizations and churches are once again making a determined push to turn out voters, helped by the first female Black candidate for president and changes to Michigan law making it easier to vote.\n\nIn what is expected to be a knife-edge US election decided by a few voters in a handful of key battleground states, the Guardian is exploring Saginaw, Michigan. It is a swing area in a swing state whose voters will bear an outsize influence on the outcome of the fight between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. Chris McGreal is on the ground in Saginaw in the run up to November's election examining the issues that voters of all political backgrounds care about.\n\nSaginaw voters: tell us which issues will decide the US election\n\nBut Terry Pruitt, president of the local National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) branch running voter education campaigns, said it was a struggle to generate enthusiasm in Saginaw.\n\n\"I've been here all my life. I grew up on the east side of Saginaw and I see the apathy. This is not something that they put at the top of the priority list when they've got to figure out, can I get to work today?\" he said.\n\n\"My church is on the south side of Saginaw, probably the lowest socioeconomic district in Saginaw county other than a couple of rural areas, and when I walk through the neighborhood and talk to people about why they don't vote, you'd be surprised how many of them say, 'that's not important to me.' These folks are going to go ahead and do what they want to do. They don't listen to me. They don't want to hear what I have to say.\"\n\nBlack residents account for nearly half of Saginaw city's 45,000 population with white people about one-third. Historically, a sharp racial divide was marked by the Saginaw river running through the heart of the city so that there were two downtowns on opposite banks.\n\nNeighborhoods on the east side are overwhelmingly Black. The west side was mostly white but the population has become more mixed in recent years as large numbers of white people moved to neighboring Saginaw Township.\n\nVoter turnout in the east of Saginaw city is consistently well below the other side of the river and anywhere else in the county. Many people are automatically registered to vote in Michigan when applying for a driving licence but do not vote.\n\nIn the 2020 election, which saw the highest turnout of voters in Michigan history at 70.5% as sharp divisions over Trump drew more people to the polls, less than half of registered voters in Saginaw city cast a ballot. In most Black neighborhoods the figure was even lower, falling below 40% in some precincts.\n\nEven during Barack Obama's first run for the White House in 2008, turnout in the east of Saginaw, where the man who would become the US's first Black president picked up more than 95% of the vote in many precincts, was still much lower than elsewhere.\n\nBut the number that some Harris supporters in Saginaw are focused on is Trump's victory in Michigan in 2016 by fewer than 11,000 votes - only slightly more than the number of registered voters who did not cast a ballot in the city of Saginaw. Although Joe Biden narrowly won the state back four years later, Michigan is again on a knife edge . Michigan could help decide the whole US election, and Saginaw could help decide the whole of Michigan.\n\nJeff Bulls, the president of the Community Alliance for the People in Saginaw, which is running a get-out-the-vote campaign, said the low turnout was not easily overcome.\n\n\"The numbers are stupid. They're really, really low. Some people, especially poorer people, they feel like their vote doesn't count. Or people have become jaded with government. A lot of them feel like government doesn't have any effect on their lives. That's how people draw back from the process: 'I'm going to go vote for what?' A lot of people are disenchanted with the process. That's not easy to change,\" he said.\n\nBulls said the sense of being overlooked by political leaders was especially evident in March, when Biden was still running for re-election. The president visited Saginaw city but failed to meet Black leaders or visit a Black church.\n\n\" There was a lot of tension with people feeling like the president didn't really care about the Black vote. His visit was specifically to come here and meet with Black leaders in the community and Black clergy to address that sentiment. When he got here, everything changed. He ended up meeting with white liberal Democrats and that pissed a lot of people off and set off a firestorm,\" he said.\n\nPruitt demanded an explanation from Biden's campaign which, he said, apologized.\n\n\"It left a bad taste in a lot of people's mouths. It was clearly a mistake and, believe me, there were several of us who let him know that,\" he said.\n\nCritics turned on the county's Democratic party and its chair, Aileen Pettinger. She shakes her head in despair on being asked about the debacle.\n\n\"Unfortunately, because I'm the party chair, I got the brunt of it. Honestly, we were only told the night before. In the past, they would ask our input. This time they did not listen to us at all,\" she said.\n\nFor some activists, the incident had echoes of Hillary Clinton's failed 2016 campaign when her staff arrived in midwestern towns waving data sets and riding roughshod over local advice, helping to cost her the election.\n\nPettinger said the Harris campaign was a long way from that. Pruitt agreed.\n\n\"I'm pretty sure that that would not happen with Harris,\" he said.\n\nBut Pruitt said the incident threw a spotlight on the alienation many in the city feel from established political parties.\n\n\"There's obviously the tendency for us who do vote to vote Democratic. But there's a school of thought that the Democratic party takes that vote for granted and really doesn't listen to what we really feel is important,\" he said.\n\nPettinger said she recognised the problem.\n\n\"We have heard that on the doors but I'm seeing a huge shift out on the doors since Kamala has announced that she was running. It's a huge difference. I haven't seen hope like this since Obama, I haven't seen this excitement,\" she said.\n\n\"I'm not losing hope. I feel very energised about it. We just have to make sure it carries over and make sure we get people to the ballot box.\"\n\nPruitt agreed that Harris had injected some enthusiasm into the election.\n\n\" I don't think it will drive it as much as Obama. I never had the slightest thought that I'd see an African American be elected president of the United States, so that phenomenon has already occurred,\" he said.\n\n\"But I see some people excited about the opportunity of a Black female being president and it will help drive our community to the polls. But in the end it's the policies that matter to get people to vote. We have to help connect the dots for people. There has to be self-interest in voting which means you have to explain those two or three issues that you think are at the top of their list, and what we have to lose if we're on the wrong side of voting on those things.\"\n\nPruitt said his get-out-the-vote campaign was focusing on the dangers Trump poses to \"the social safety network\", including housing support, childcare assistance, and disability and social security payments.\n\n\"As a national theme, abortion is out there and that's what the parties are running with. That may be on the list for the average Black woman on the east side of Saginaw but it's much further down the list. But if we start talking about losing the department of education and how that's going to impact their children, that will hit home very quickly,\" he said.\n\nBulls said affordable housing was also a major issue in Saginaw even though the city's population has dropped sharply over recent decades. Saginaw is dotted with grass-covered spaces where abandoned houses have been torn down, but rents for what remains are high and the quality often substandard.\n\n\"In Saginaw city, almost 70% of our housing is over 60 years old. There's a lot of blight, a lot of houses that have already been torn down or need to be torn down. There haven't been any new builds in the city, en masse, probably this century. So we just have a huge need for new housing, whether it's single family housing or apartments,\" he said.\n\nThen there is policing in a city with one of the highest crime rates in the country. Bulls said some of the alienation comes from frustration at the political decision to bring the state police into Saginaw.\n\n\"We've had a couple different community forums on it because people are really concerned. There's a state programme called the secure cities partnership. It has largely brought a bunch of Michigan state police into the community. It's been basically a stop-and-frisk program. They don't answer 911 calls. They literally just patrol and pull people over. There's a huge racial disparity on where they patrol and who they pull over. It's been a very, very tense issue here, and it'll continue to be until it's dealt with,\" he said.\n\nStill, campaigners see an opportunity in the introduction of nine days of early voting for this year's presidential election which, they say, which will assist Black churches running \"souls to the polls\" initiatives to lead their congregations to vote after Sunday services.\n\nPruitt has also looked to other places for advice, including to Stacey Abrams , the Georgia politician who created voting rights organisations that proved crucial in the Democrats winning two key seats in the US Senate four years ago.\n\n\"We've had conversations with Stacey Abrams and people from Georgia because it was remarkable what she did. But when I started looking at how she did it, it takes an army of people and an awful lot of money to make it happen. That's another side of this, the resources, because the frustration for people like me is marshalling the resources to get it done,\" he said.\n\nBulls feels the same constraints, and laments what he sees as the tendency of white politicians to leave it to Black organisations to get out the vote in their community.\n\n\"It shouldn't be left to us but here we are.

      "text": "Democrats work to make sure Black men see their place in Harris's big tent\n\nBlack men remain reliably Democratic in presidential elections, yet talk of defection towards Trump persists\n\nT ravis Foreman, a Black attorney in metro Atlanta , says he's been everywhere on the political spectrum. \"I voted Democrat, I voted Republican, I voted independent, you know, I voted all over the map,\" he said. \"But I personally believe that this country is headed into a very dark place.\n\n\"I know a lot of people believe that Donald Trump is the reason for that dark place,\" he added, \"but I actually disagree.\"\n\nForeman's politics are at the center of a broad conversation about Black men voting for Trump. The only people in America who are less likely to vote for Trump than Black men are Black women. That is the history of Black voters and Democratic presidential candidates over the last 10 election cycles, from Ronald Reagan's second term to today.\n\nAnd yet, talk of defection by an unexpected number of Black male voters to Trump remains persistent. Obama himself has said he finds the focus on Black men and Trump support puzzling.\n\n\"[Harris's] message is directly focused on the challenges that we face as Black men, and that our communities face, and that America faces,\" he said on an organizing call Sunday hosted by Win With Black Men. \"Donald Trump has shown utter disrespect and disregard for our communities - and for Black men specifically - throughout his career.\"\n\nMedia reports citing polling data have suggested that Trump is capturing more Black male voters than previous election cycles. Many of those reports have relied on a statistical aberration in polling data - smaller sample sizes of Black voters within larger polls. As the election evolves in earnest, polls suggest Harris is suddenly recovering to the traditional baseline of Democratic support from Black voters.\n\n\"It's nonsense that Black men are not supporting the vice-president. We are supporting the vice-president. We actually have the data to prove that,\" said Quentin James, CEO of the Collective Pac, a political fundraising organization supporting Black candidates. His organization has been tracking turnout and conducting polling throughout the campaign, he said.\n\nJames noted that Black turnout was softer in Georgia and North Carolina than Democrats would like, particularly among younger voters. Though turnout overall is breaking records, Black voters compose only about 26% of the electorate so far in Georgia - about four points shy of what conventional wisdom in the state suggests is a Democratic win.\n\n\"So as Black men, we need you all to be surrogate fathers for the next nine days,\" he said. \"If you see a Black young person, they are your child, a child of our community. We need you to encourage them to show up and vote for Vice-President Kamala Harris.\"\n\nRepublican policy objectives stand in stark contrast to the stated social and economic interests widely expressed by Black voters, with a conservative assault on diversity initiatives central to the Trump campaign. The last time Democrats nominated a Black candidate for the presidency, turnout among Black voters increased - proportionately exceeding white turnout in 2012 for the first time in American history. Barack Obama won about 93% of the Black vote.\n\nObama refrained from lecturing Black men for political backsliding on the Sunday call, as well as at a Harris rally in the heart of Atlanta's Black suburbs in Clarkston, Georgia , last week. The former president drew some criticism from a previous appearance in Pittsburgh this month, when he told Black men to get over their reluctance to vote for a woman. Some Black men \"just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, as you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that\", Obama said.\n\nFor Black men who are steadfast Democratic voters, though, the impulse to question the motivations of Black Trump voters looms large.\n\n\"Black men need to grow up,\" said Darryl Manning, a business consultant in Atlanta who cast his vote for Harris on the first day of early voting. \"Black men need to own their communities again. We don't have those leaders any more. We don't have the Malcolm X and the Martin Luther King and the Ralph David Abernathy and the John Lewises any more ... Black women held up, Black women stepped in, and Black women have led our communities.\"\n\nTrump won 12% of the Black vote in 2020. That is close to the high-water mark since the political realignments of the 1960s. Reagan maxed out Republican support among Black voters at 14% in 1980. With the exception of the Obama years, Republicans win a tight band of 8-12% of the Black vote.\n\nThat figure disguises a significant gender gap. Historically, about 15-20% of Black men vote for Republicans, compared with 5-9% of Black women.\n\nTrey Baker, a senior Harris adviser working on Black voter outreach, said it was on the campaign to bring in voters who may have sat out in recent years.\n\n\"We have to take that next step,\" he said. \"Go out and make sure that the disaffected voters, the people who didn't vote last time, the people who don't see themselves in some of these policies and some of these things, show them where they fit in.\""

      "text": "'I'm rocking with Kamala': Black men defy faulty polling by showing up for Harris campaign\n\nSpecific results on her performance with Black voters aren't in yet, but recent calls suggest a Trump exodus is not true\n\nO n Monday night, more than 53,000 Black men joined a virtual conference, Win With Black Men, to rally behind the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, Kamala Harris. During the four-hour call, organizers said the group raised more than $1.3m for the Harris campaign and grassroots voter organizations focused on Black men.\n\nThe success of the call, which was inspired by the Win With Black Women call the night before , runs counter to the narrative shaped by recent election polling indicating that 30% of Black men are planning on voting for Donald Trump. \"Don't let anybody slow us down asking the question: 'Can a Black woman be elected president of the United States?'\" Raphael Warnock, who represents Georgia in the US Senate, said on the call. \"Kamala Harris can win. We just have to show up. History is watching us, and the future is waiting on us.\"\n\nBlack voters have consistently been a key voting bloc for Democrats , but experts say inaccurate polling about Black men in particular could be creating false narratives about their leanings this election cycle, mainly the idea that there is a mass shift of Black voters to the Republican party. Win With Black Men, which was hosted by the journalist Roland Martin, said it's working to dispel stereotypical notions about changes in Black male voting habits, their refusal to support a woman candidate and their unwillingness to mobilize politically.\n\n\"People are making a lot of conjectures without actually talking to a large enough sample of Black people to be able to say things with the precision that they're making it,\" Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University, said. \"You're not going to be able to detect what is likely to be no more [than] a one- to three-point swing in favor of Donald Trump based on changes in surveys where you're talking to 200 Black people at a time. I can't say with any statistical certainty that that three-point shift is real or not.\"\n\nUnrepresentative polls can also have an adverse effect on voter habits. People tend to vote if they perceive that an election is close, Gillespie said. So polls that suggest that Trump is going to win easily and that even Black people will vote in droves for him may distort people's understanding of reality. Ensuring that the public is aware of potential polling inaccuracies is key.\n\n\"These narratives are also used to kind of confuse Black voters themselves, which can in turn depress Black vote and drive down turnout,\" said Christopher Towler, founder of the Black Voter Project (BVP), a national polling initiative. \"It can be used as a mechanism of voter deterrence, knowing that Black voters will play a key role in this election.\"\n\nThough Gillespie said it will take a few days for new polling that specifically examines how Harris is performing with Black voters, recent mobilization around Harris suggests that narratives about a would-be exodus of this bloc from the Democratic party might have been premature.\n\nThe problem comes down to sample size. In surveys of 1,000 to 1,500 voters , sub-sample sizes of Black voters may be anywhere from 150 to 300. In some cases, all people of color are amalgamated into one demographic group. Surveys with such a small sample size create large margins of error.\n\n\"The issue is the level of precision with which we can make certain types of pronouncements when you're talking to that few people,\" Gillespie said. \"The number that comes out in the survey is the midpoint of a range of possible numbers that we think is in the real population because of statistical analysis.\"\n\nIf the sub-sample size is less than 100, she said, the margin of error is plus or minus 10. So if a survey says that 20% of Black voters are going for Trump, the real number based on the sub-sample is between 10% and 30%.\n\nTowler, of the Black Voter Project, said that he began noticing the issue of unrepresentative polling years ago. He started BVP to \"counteract the industry standard of taping on a couple hundred Black responses to a general survey\" and using that small sample size as a full picture.\n\n\"It's really unscientific,\" Towler said. \"So I've worked for years now to try and create data that is reliable, accurate and actually representative of the Black community.\"\n\nThis year, BVP released a large, multiwave, national public opinion survey focused on collecting representative data of Black Americans . Fielded from 29 March to 18 April, with 2,004 Black Americans interviewed, the survey collected a nationally representative sample of respondents from all 50 states. The BVP study found that 15% of respondents would vote for Trump if the election had been held at the time of the survey, a figure much lower than reported by other polls with smaller sample sizes. A survey on the BVP scale is important to garner an idea of what the Black population and Black voting population of the US actually looks like, Gillespie said.\n\nSign up to This Week in Trumpland\n\nA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nBut mainstream beltway polling companies typically lack Black leadership, so accurate polling of Black communities is not a priority, said Towler. What's more, some pollsters do not see the value in spending more money to survey a population that they estimate will already vote staunchly Democratic.\n\nBlack and brown communities exist on the margins in American politics, said Emmitt Riley, president of the National Conference of Black Political Scientists. Mainstream political scientists' biases result in pollsters who are not adequately capturing the political behaviors and views of excluded groups.\n\n\"Many people who study race aren't considered to be mainstream political scholars,\" he said. \"This has profound consequences for the kind of reporting that's happening, the kind of news stories that are coming out, how you describe what's happening in these communities.\"\n\nTowler said that pollsters should create surveys that are culturally competent and that ask questions in ways that don't manufacture misleading opinions. \"It's important when looking at polling of Black people to, one, not only make sure you have polls designed to accurately measure Black opinion, but to also have pollsters who study and understand the Black community,\" he said.\n\nWhile polls continue to try to parse out where Black men will place their political support, groups like Win With Black Men and Black Men for Harris are making their loyalties clear.\n\n\"Let's protect Kamala. Let's be with her like she was there for us,\" Bakari Sellers, the former South Carolina representative, said on the call. \"We are going to disagree a lot. But let's put the petty bickering aside. Let's stand up and be the Black men who change this country. We built this country. I'm rocking with Kamala.\""

      "text": "Harris reveals 'opportunity agenda for Black men' in efforts to shore up support\n\nPlan includes loan program and apprenticeships as worries grow that some Black voters aren't excited for Harris-Walz\n\nKamala Harris has revealed a plan to give Black men more economic opportunities, as anxiety mounts among her supporters that some in the Black community are less enthused by the Democratic presidential ticket than in recent elections, and may sit this one out - or support Donald Trump.\n\nThe vice-president's plan includes forgivable business loans for Black entrepreneurs, creating more apprenticeships, and studying sickle cell and other diseases that disproportionately affect African American men. It also includes ensuring that Black men have more access to shaping a national cannabis industry and to invest in cryptocurrency.\n\nHarris presented the so-called \"opportunity agenda for Black men\" on Monday, before speaking in the north-west corner of Erie, Pennsylvania , the country's largest battleground state. It will be Harris's 10th visit to Pennsylvania this election season.\n\nPolitical support among Black men for the Harris-Walz campaign has been wavering somewhat. Last week, Barack Obama suggested that some Black men \"aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president\".\n\nThe former president's comments were later condemned by the Florida Republican representative Byron Donalds and Texas's Wesley Hunt, members of Black Men for Trump, which posted a letter accusing Obama of being \"insulting\" and \"demeaning\".\n\n\"President Obama's recent call for Black men to support Kamala Harris based solely on her skin color, rather than her policies, is deeply insulting,\" the letter states. \"Black Americans are not a monolith, and we don't owe our votes to any candidate just because they 'look like us'.\"\n\nOver the weekend, the former president Bill Clinton was drafted in to speak to worshippers at a Zion Baptist church in Albany, Georgia, in support of Harris.\n\n\"Uniting people and building, being repairers of the breach, as Isaiah says, those are the things that work,\" Clinton said. \"Blaming, dividing, demeaning - they get you a bunch of votes at election time, but they don't work.\"\n\nA poll in the New York Times placed Harris slightly behind Joe Biden among Black likely voters and showed one in five Black men support Trump. Despite alarm at the poll, the figures still show strong Black support for Democrats - but while the president won 87% of the Black vote in 2020, Harris's numbers are lower. Seventy-eight per cent of Black voters in key battleground states polled in September said they would support the Democrat.\n\nRaphael Warnock, a Democratic senator from Georgia, warned against overestimating the shift. \"Black men are not going to vote for Donald Trump in any significant numbers,\" he told CNN on Sunday. \"There will be some. We're not a monolith.\"\n\nWarnock predicted Black voters would remember that Trump had personally taken out a full-page ad in the New York Times in 1989 calling for the state to bring back the death penalty and to strengthen policing after the brutal beating and rape of a female jogger in Central Park.\n\nThe so-called \"Central Park Five\" - five Black teenagers - were falsely accused of the crime and imprisoned for several years, before finally being exonerated in 2002. \"Donald Trump has shown no deal of concern about what they went through, no deal, no bit of contrition about it,\" Warnock added.\n\nBut the South Carolina representative Jim Clyburn, who helped secure Biden's Democratic nomination in 2020, told the network he is \"concerned about the Black men staying home or voting for Trump\".\n\n\"Black men, like everybody else, want to know exactly what I can expect from a Harris administration. And I have been very direct with them. And I have also contrasted that with what they can expect from a Trump administration,\" Clyburn said.\n\nSign up to This Week in Trumpland\n\nA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nDemocrats have previously been accused of taking the Black vote for granted. In 2020, Biden was forced to apologize for telling the popular radio host Charlamagne Tha God that if African Americans \"have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't Black\".\n\nTrump has sought to capitalize on wavering Black male support for Democrats who may sympathize with his \"America First\" policies around employment and immigration.\n\nAs well as Harris's new policy outreach to Black men, she is also reaching out to Hispanic men who might also be cool to her candidacy, via an \"Hombres con Harris\" outreach featuring ad buys and Hispanic celebrity events in battleground states.\n\nThree weeks out from polling day, there is some Democratic concern that Harris's support among men broadly needs attention. Polls have found that there is roughly a 60-40 split between men and women, with men favoring Republicans and women Democrats.\n\nA Pew Research Center study released last year asked Americans how important it is to them that a woman be elected president in their lifetime. It found that only 18% of US adults said this is extremely or very important to them, with some 64% saying it was not too important or not at all, or that the president's gender did not matter."

      "text": "Do black people vote? The racist lie rooted in the American psyche\n\nDespite the tactics of voter suppression working against them, black people are one of the most stable voting blocs in the US\n\nThere is a common stereotype among black and white Americans, and it's that black people don't vote.\n\nDuring his 2016 keynote address at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, Barack Obama went so far as to say : \"Even if all restrictions on voting were eliminated, African Americans would still have one of the lowest voting rates. That's not good. That is on us.'\" On the other end of the spectrum, Trump insinuated that black voters stayed home during the election. \"They didn't come out to vote for Hillary. They didn't come out... so thank you to the African American community.\"\n\nThe same message reverberated through political commentary and activism. Brando Starkey of The Undefeated wrote that, \"Black people who didn't vote let us down ,\" in the 2016 election. Two years later, the Detroit News' Bankole Thompson wrote, \"It is not enough to raise your fist in a political frenzy as a symbol of Black power and solidarity if you are failing to exercise the power of the ballot and not showing up at the polls.\"\n\nDespite these comments, \"black people don't vote\" is not based in data: though they are only 13% of the US population, black voters are among the most stable voting bloc in politics, despite the concerted efforts to stop them. The myth, instead is rooted in an exaggerated narrative derived from Reconstruction-era stereotypes about work ethic, opportunity and culpability. Similar to how black people were the economic scapegoat for the downfall of southern states once slavery was outlawed, they also became the political scapegoat for the losses of the Republican party in the late 1800s.\n\nAfter the civil war, black voter turnout boomed and elected nearly 20 black people to the House and Senate and many more to local and state positions. By December 1887, however, Congress convened without one black member in about two decades leading to \" The Negroes Temporary Farewell \" when black people were excluded from Congress.\n\nAs black people gained political power during Reconstruction, southern states passed stringent voter ID laws and gave black people voting literacy tests that included outlandish questions such as: how many plies are on a roll of toilet paper or how many bubbles does a bar of soap have? Some were even lynched for voting or asking for the right to vote.\n\nBlack people became disenchanted with the Republican party and some started to align with the civil rights arm of the Democratic party as Jim Crow continued to disenfranchise them. Once the 15th amendment was restored during the civil rights movement, black people instantly became a strong voting bloc for the Democratic party, particularly in the south.\n\nWhen Democrats lose, however, it is the same stereotype - black people didn't come out to vote. But in the last three presidential elections, black voter turnout was 59.6% in 2016, 66.6% in 2012, and 65.2% in 2008. The voter turnout for black people in each of these elections was higher than Latinos and Asians and higher than whites in 2012.\n\nOf the 10 states highlighted in the graph, black voter turnout in seven of these states in 2016 was higher or the same as their percentage of the state. In five states, black people represented over 40% of Democratic voters in 2016.\n\nWhile it is true that black voter turnout decreased from 2012 to 2016, it does not mean that black people are to blame for the Democratic loss of the 2016 election. Twelve percent of whites who voted for Obama in 2012 voted for Trump in 2016. Considering Hillary Clinton lost by less than 11,000 votes in Michigan and 44,000 votes in Pennsylvania, these changes made a difference too.\n\nDespite the apparent preference for voting Democrat, black voters are not a monolith. Gender , education and incarceration are factors in determining voter turnout and political party preference. Generally, women vote at higher rates than men across race, and this is true of black women too. And, while most black women with or without college degrees voted for Hillary Clinton, only 78% of black men with a college degree (16% voted for Trump) and 82% without a college degree voted Democrat (11% voted for Trump).\n\nThis data still doesn't tell the whole story. Current barriers to voting are real, pervasive and covert. In 2013, the decision in the Shelby county v Holder case afforded people who want to disenfranchise black people the license to do so. Incriminating documents were found on the hard drive of a Republican operative known as the \"gerrymandering king\" who deliberately drew new political maps to dilute the black vote in North Carolina. Nearly 900 polling places were closed from 2012 to 2016, including over 400 in Texas and nearly 40 in the Carolinas.\n\nThere are also the 6.1 million people disenfranchised due to felony convictions. About 40% of this group is black. This means one of every 13 black people cannot vote due to voter disenfranchisement.\n\nWe have to challenge the stereotypes and assumptions we make about each other and recognize that real barriers to voting continue to persist but are surmountable. If we really want to create racial equity in the political process so that all Americans can truly embrace American democracy, The Voting Rights Act will be fully restored and expanded, the Shelby v Holder decision will be revisited to prevent gerrymandering, millions of returning citizens will have their voting rights restored, and election day will become a federal day of service to remove barriers related to employment.\n\nDr Rashawn Ray is a David M Rubenstein f ellow in Governance Studies at the Brookings Institution , an a ssociate p rofessor of Sociology at the University of Maryland, and the e xecutive d irector of the Lab for Applied Social Science Research.

      "text": "If we the Black voters 'get loud', neither the Tories nor Donald Trump will survive\n\nOn both sides of the Atlantic, populists are peddling racism. I'm here in the UK to urge Black communities to see it for what it is\n\nD onald Trump's racist mentality has long been an open secret. In the 1970s, a federal lawsuit was brought against him for alleged racial discrimination on one of his housing developments in New York. He led the campaign calling for the death penalty against the Central Park Five, who were accused of a brutal rape but later vindicated. Even after that exoneration, he continued to suggest they were guilty .\n\nSo are Black Americans flocking to support Trump? Reports are mixed. Trump himself would tell you he has a unique affinity with the Black community, but personally, I don't buy it. Polling in 2020 estimated Trump would take 20% of the black vote. The real number was closer to 8% .\n\nAfter all, let's remember what he says about us. Just this weekend, he said that Black Americans identified with him because he had faced criminal charges and we embraced his criminal mugshot . That was outright racist and insulting. For him to say that during Black History Month in the US is the epitome of an insult.\n\nAnd the irony is that he is the one being prosecuted - and by Black professionals at that. The New York state attorney general, Letitia James , brought the financially ruinous civil financial fraud case against Trump. Fani Willis , Fulton county district attorney, was responsible for challenging Trump's alleged election interference in Georgia.\n\nI spend a lot of time speaking with Black voters. I host a US radio show six days a week - and from what I hear, I'm not alone in thinking that claims that he has growing support among our community are grossly exaggerated. But I do think it is fair to say that Black citizens are asking questions of the Democrats.\n\nJoe Biden has simply not done a good enough job on messaging. He needs to be more aggressive in speaking to Black voters - laying out his record, such as the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act (which Trump opposed) and his support for the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act (which almost every Republican voted down). Biden should not assume people know what they haven't been reminded of.\n\nUS liberals must understand that if you take the high road and are not making noise about it, no one knows that you're taking any road. They have to be more vocal, they have to challenge more, and not run away from the issue of race.\n\nThat goes for the left in the UK, too. Arriving yesterday, I was disgusted to hear racist, Islamophobic language being used by members of the Conservative party. The Tories seem to be alarmingly Trump-like in their language. And that should be a mobilising cry to millions of Black British voters to register to vote.\n\nIt shocks me that the wider British public doesn't seem to understand the gravity of the threat to Black voting in the UK. The UK's new photo ID legislation disproportionately disadvantages Black and minority voters. We know - similar legislation was used against us in the US. But Black people mobilised against it, and in 2021 helped to elect Raphael Warnock as Georgia's first Black US senator. It shows the importance of fighting back.\n\nThat's why I came here: to tell leaders to use our playbook to challenge laws that suppress the Black vote - and to impress on Black communities the importance of turning out. It is imperative to democracy that we awaken the black vote in the UK and bring it alive. And we must do it simultaneously in the US.\n\nBiden has an opportunity to expose Trump's lies and get disenfranchised communities back on side. To do that, he must be candid: he must openly call out Trump's blatant racism for what it is. He must tell Black voters how Trump stacked the courts in a way that is detrimental to them, and that he will aggressively fight that. The Democrats still have time to recapture those whom they think they are losing. If they do that, Trump will have no recourse. He can't undo things he has already said and done.\n\nYou have to turn people on before you can turn them out. And if you turn them on to what is being done to us - what has already been said about us - you can turn people out. Liberal movements in the US and the UK have been blindly hoping that people will turn out on their own. But leaders must understand they won't mobilise without a reason. It's not enough to be proud in silence - we need to get loud again.\n\nThe Rev Al Sharpton is a civil rights leader, activist and founder and president of National Action Network (Nan).

      "text": "The Media Is Giving Black Men Too Much Credit For Something White Women Do - Support Trump\n\nOpinion Editor\n\nAs soon as there is even a whisper of a possible Donald Trump presidency, out come this mysterious group of Black men, that wear boat shoes and khaki pants that don't meet their ankles. Black men that don't frequent Black barbershops that can't wait to vote for The Orange One.\n\nFor some reason there is this belief that the pathway to a Trump victory takes a suburban off-ramp into the mythical marsh of Black men who don't listen to hip-hop and who plan to tush-push Trump into the White House.\n\nThere are surveys and polls and conversations all supporting this belief that young Black men are going to not only vote for Trump but tip the scales in his favor because young Black men ― or at least a quarter of those surveyed ― somehow find themselves connected to the man who once yelled out, \" Oh, look at my African American over here ,\" during a rally in which the Republican presidential nominee spotted a lone Black face in the crowd.\n\nMake no mistake about it, Trump's been pulling out all the stops to try and sway young Black voters by getting endorsements from Detroit rapper Trick Trick, former boxer Tommy \"Hitman\" Hearns, former NFL players Antonio Brown and Le'Veon Bell, and famous celebrity Amber Rose. This is of course assuming young Black male voters even know who these people are.\n\nBut let's not get it twisted. If for some reason Trump wins this election, it will not be the fault of Black men. Not young Black men. Not foreign born, legal voting Black men. Not Black men who still believe that Trump gave everyone $1,200 during the pandemic. (He didn't, Congress did.) Not any of the Black men who are Black men and who will ever be Black men. No Black man, even those who might vote for Trump, will sway the election.\n\nPeriod.\n\nBut what feels more sinister about this election cycle are reruns of \"Black men can't wait to cast their votes for a man who openly despises them\" ― an undercurrent of potential blame toward Black men should Trump make it into the White House.\n\nIt feels like enough pieces have been written claiming that \"Black voters could play an important role in determining the outcome of key 2024 elections,\" as Pew Research claimed early this year ― and that is just not true. Let's be clear about this, Black women don't vote Republican. They aren't just the backbone of the Democratic party, they are the Democratic party.\n\n\"For nearly a quarter of a century, an astounding 90% or more of Black women voters have rallied behind the Democratic ticket in presidential elections,\" Glamour magazine reports . \"In the last election alone, in nearly every state, 80% to 90% of Black voters cast their ballot for the Democratic candidate. It's a consistency that spans regions and decades.\"\n\nSo if we aren't talking about Black women voters, then who must we be talking about when news outlets claim: \" Harris and Trump tied amid battle for Latino and Black voters \" ― if, historically, Black women don't ever vote Republican.\n\nThey must be talking about Black men. And this narrative, this setup if you will, that's been spinning for some time that Black men are going to help lead Trump to victory isn't just false, like much of Trump's campaign promises, it's a flat out lie.\n\n\"This election is not going to be won or lost by the number of Black men that support or do not support [Kamala Harris], even though it's going to be probably razor-thin,\" Martin Luther King III told USA TODAY . \"You can't go and say, well, it's Black men's fault.\"\n\n\"That's where it seems like it's trying to go,\" he added.\n\nAnd MLK III isn't wrong. For some reason this idea that Black men are planning on voting for Trump or sitting this election out was, unfortunately, perpetuated by former President Barack Obama, who chided Black men that he believed were planning to sit this election out because they couldn't bring themselves to vote for a Black woman.\n\n\"You're thinking about sitting out or supporting somebody [Trump] who has a history of denigrating you, because you think that's a sign of strength, because that's what being a man is? Putting women down?\" Obama said, during Harris' rally in Pittsburgh . \"That's not acceptable.\"\n\n\"You're coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses, I've got a problem with that,\" Obama said. \"Because part of it makes me think ― and I'm speaking to men directly ― part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.\"\n\nIt was a gotcha moment for the former president that lasted a current news cycle (which is about 10 minutes) in which Black men who never liked Obama in the first place took this as an opportunity to hit social media to lambast the sentiment that there is apathy amongst Black men and voting. Truthfully, it was the murmuring from some Black men who couldn't bring themselves to vote for a woman because Black men still benefit from white patriarchy, but it wasn't enough to be mentioned. Obama should've known this was a trap and avoided it.\n\nBecause Black people don't vote for Republicans. Not even disgruntled Black men. Not in numbers that would even remotely affect an election.\n\n\"Nearly a century has passed since a Republican presidential nominee even came close to winning a majority of the Black vote (Herbert Hoover in 1928 was the last),\" Michael Harriot, a columnist for the Grio, wrote in January.\n\n\"It is asinine, bordering on malpractice, for a journalist to publicly suggest that one of the most vociferously anti-Black candidates could achieve what no Republican has done in the last 96 years. Setting aside the media's lazy, inexplicably stupid exercise in speculative fiction, one wonders why the mainstream media narrative seems to intentionally avoid the one topic that - when it comes to presidential elections - is more important and more mathematically relevant.\"\n\nHarriot continued: \"The same organization (Pew Research) that said that thing about the \"important role\" of Black voters in 2024 knows that 55% of non-Hispanic whites voted for Trump in 2020, while 92% of Black voters, 59% of Hispanics and 7% of Asians voted for his opponent. Political scientists concede that white voters of both parties are more likely to switch parties when the candidate is Black.\"\n\nSo this planted storyline, this sorry attempt to posthumously blame a possible wayward presidency on Black men is so Trumpian, it could be a page out of Project 2025. It's completely made up. It's not actually a thing. This is no mass deportation of Black male voters leaving the Democratic Party to vote for Trump.\n\nShould Trump make it across the finish line and somehow bring his brand of fascism back to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. for a second time ― this undoing American democracy as we know it ― it will fall solely on the shoulders of white men and women, but more specifically white women.\n\nLet's take a trip back to 2020 when President Joe Biden was supposed to win by a landslide because the country was exhausted from all the racial rhetoric, the misogyny, the sexual assault allegations, COVID-19, and the president of the United States throwing paper towels at hurricane survivors. And that's the Cliff Notes version. White women were supposed to throw all their support behind Biden if for nothing more than to oust the sitting president, and yet, more white women voted for Trump.\n\nAccording to NBC News , 55% of white women voted for Trump, while 43% voted for Biden. Compare that to 91% of Black women (Black women are y'all tired of holding up America?) voted for Biden while some 8% supported Trump.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Should Joe Biden Really Be Worried About Black Voters?\n\nSenior National Correspondent, HuffPost\n\nDETROIT ― President Joe Biden plans to address an NAACP gala dinner here on Sunday night, following a week of outreach to Black voters that has included a speech at the National Museum of African American History and Culture and multiple interviews with media outlets that target Black audiences. He'll be coming here directly from Atlanta , where he plans to meet with Black voters before giving the commencement address at Morehouse, a historically Black men's college.\n\nOfficially, the impetus for all of this is the 70th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education , the landmark Supreme Court decision striking down school segregation and its toxic principle of \"separate but equal.\"\n\nUnofficially? Biden is on a mission to shore up support among what has long been one of the Democratic Party's most loyal constituencies.\n\nHe may have some serious work to do.\n\nIf you are a left-leaning voter who follows politics closely, then you were probably gnashing your teeth about a New York Times/Siena College poll of six swing states that came out Monday. And it wasn't just because the poll showed Biden trailing former President Donald Trump in five of them.\n\nIn that poll, Trump got more than 20% of the Black vote, which would be a higher share than any Republican presidential candidate has gotten since the 1960s . And it wasn't some kind of outlier. Polls have been picking up similar results for months.\n\nThose less favorable results would still leave Biden with the vast majority of Black voters. The problem is that it will be difficult for Biden to win if he can't get the kind of backing from Black voters he got in 2020, when his support among them was above 90%, according to a Pew Research study of the electorate.\n\nThen there's the question of turnout. A sharp drop in Black turnout in 2016 was a critical factor in Hillary Clinton's loss, especially in states like Michigan, where Trump's winning margin was just 11,000 votes. The same thing could happen to Biden in 2024.\n\nThe election is still more than five months away, and the polls could be flat-out wrong. (Really!) But the evidence of depressed enthusiasm among Black voters at this point is too strong to dismiss, which is why this week I reached out to one of my contacts in Michigan, Charles Williams , for some insights.\n\nWilliams is the young pastor of a storied Detroit church, a veteran of progressive political causes and chair of Michigan's chapter for the National Action Network . At my request, he gathered a handful of politically active voters from the community for me to talk to.\n\nIt wasn't a formal focus group. And 90 minutes of conversation isn't enough to reveal essential truths about the state of American politics. But I did pick up on a handful of themes that resonated with what the polls are showing ― and, to some extent, with what I heard from local political organizers I contacted afterwards.\n\nThe themes those voters discussed would certainly help explain why Biden hasn't yet generated more enthusiasm. They may also offer some hints about how Biden could still reach ambivalent Black voters before Election Day.\n\nWe met at Williams' church, the King Solomon Baptist Church on Detroit's west side, in a small conference room lined with Civil Rights posters.\n\nThe group of four Williams assembled were all men under 40, the very category of Black voters that the pollsters say is least enthusiastic about Biden. And that would apply to these four men, too, none of whom seemed likely to vote for Trump ― or even to think about it ― but none of whom seemed especially excited about Biden, either. They told me that was a typical attitude.\n\nWe started by talking about Biden's presidency and what they thought of it. All of them could cite at least some of the administration's accomplishments, like bringing down the price of insulin , or the executive actions he took to wipe out some people's student debt .\n\nBiden's decision to join striking workers on a United Auto Workers picket line in September also made an impression, especially with voter Carlos Topp, who works at a Stellantis auto-stamping plant.\n\n\"When Joe Biden walked that picket line, speaking from a UAW perspective, my colleagues, my peers, those who I work with, we were inspired by that,\" said Topp. \"Everybody noticed. Everybody talked about it.\"\n\nBut Topp said other policy achievements weren't registering with voters he knew. He cited as an example the bipartisan infrastructure law , which has supercharged a construction boom in Michigan . Topp said his neighbors perceive jobs resulting from all that development as primarily benefiting other people.\n\n\"It typically doesn't go to the Black hands, the Black contractors, the Black construction workers,\" Topp said. \"When we see that flow of money, going from the federal government to the states, we don't get excited, because those exchanges of monies ... don't typically go to our hands and don't go to our communities, and it doesn't really benefit us.\"\n\nBiden's defense of the Affordable Care Act matters, they said, and memories of Trump's repeal efforts linger. But other accomplishments, like the changes to drug prices, seemed to register less among younger men, who were more likely to see that as a benefit primarily for older people.\n\nIt's not that any of these accomplishments were unworthy of praise, they stressed. Rather, they had a sense that these policies helped around the margins, but would not produce the kind of dramatic changes that their communities need, especially when it comes to bolstering economic security.\n\n\"Not everybody's a diabetic, not everybody works for a motor company,\" said Dwayne Rushin , a musician and political activist. \"So what are you doing for the people who still need help?\"\n\n\"I think a lot of people feel like, Democrat or Republican, it really doesn't matter,\" Williams said. \"That's not a good place to be, particularly if we are trying to get folks to make sure that they get to the polls to participate in this election.\"\n\nThe flip side to this disappointment (or disenchantment, or whatever you want to call it) is the attitude towards Trump I heard from these men. The sentiment wasn't praise or respect. But it also wasn't fear or dread.\n\n\"He's selfish to the core,\" Quincy Coleman, a former city council candidate who works at an engineering firm, said of Trump. But Coleman thinks that has led some Black voters to write off Trump's outrageous or offensive statements, like calling African nations \" shithole countries ,\" as garden-variety pandering, rather than a deep-seated racism that could affect their lives.\n\nIt also matters, Coleman said, that Trump had a reservoir of support - or at least attention - from his \"Apprentice\" era. \"People forget this, but Trump, before he became president, was a larger-than-life figure in the Black community. If you can go back and listen to some rap songs, several rap songs, he's mentioned by name ― like about how wealthy he is, or how we want to be like him.\"\n\nThe disappointment that Biden's changes don't register more in everyday life is hard to address. At least for the short term, there's not a lot Biden and his supporters can do to extract more sweeping change from a system in which money has so much influence, Senate apportionment tilts power to conservative states and social media spreads misinformation so easily.\n\nIt's one of the basic, paradoxical problems that always bedevil ambitious Democrats . Their seeming inability to transform American life fuels disenchantment that in turn drains the political support they would need in order to achieve more.\n\nBut the Biden campaign certainly has an argument to make.\n\nIt can point to the ways infrastructure spending and prescription drug reforms really are making a difference to Black voters, and in significant ways, by fueling economic activity and putting lifesaving medicines within reach. Nationally, Black unemployment reached historic lows this year, as did the proportion of Black Americans without health insurance . And Black business ownership is increasing by its fastest rate in three decades.\n\nBiden and his supporters can also remind voters of Trump's record, including his denial of and then slow reaction to the COVID-19 pandemic . That could have special resonance in Michigan, given that Detroit among the cities where the virus hit earliest and hardest .\n\nThe campaign is already working at getting that message out through major ad buys, social media posts, meetings with community leaders and appearances like the ones Biden is making this week. A memo the campaign released on Friday detailed these efforts, as well as Biden's record on issues important to the Black community.\n\n\"We are meeting Black voters where they are,\" it said.\n\nStill, Williams says, breaking through may require more emphasis on using trusted messengers - by, for example, doing rapid-fire appearances on the feeds of locally prominent influencers, in the same way past candidates called in to speak with local radio hosts.\n\nAnother trusted messenger could be Vice President Kamala Harris - who, in the minds of some Black voters, isn't getting the role or prominence she deserves. \"It's as if they keep her somewhere in the back, and when it's time for her to speak, they throw her out there,\" Topp told me. \"They don't want her to speak from a place of power.\"\n\nWilliams said he too thinks there's a bigger role for her, though with a different kind of outreach.\n\n\"I would put Kamala Harris in gym shoes, dress-down clothes, and have her walk through these communities in Milwaukee and Detroit,\" Williams said. \"Not at a museum, not behind some closed desk or podium - I mean walking with Secret Service and the limo, just going through these communities in Detroit and Milwaukee and Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, and not waiting until two days before the election.\"\n\nIt's impossible to know how representative these views are, or how well they predict what will happen in November. When I called Norman Clement , founder and executive director of the Detroit Change Initiative, he cautioned against excessive pessimism.\n\n\"Not showing enthusiasm and not turning out to vote are two different things,\" he said.\n\nClement also thinks the people he meets in his organizing efforts are more attuned to the threat of Trump than it may seem. He says that includes younger Black men, who fear what a second Trump term could mean for women and reproductive health care. \"We are husbands and fathers. ... We also have daughters,\" Clement said.\n\nAt the same time, Clement said he too is hearing from young Black men who \"want something better, not just the same old, same old, same old.\"\n\nAnthony Baber , communications director for Detroit Action, describes it as \"a sense of apathy.\"\n\n\"I don't think it necessarily means that they're eager or intending to vote for Trump,\" Baber said \"It's just that there's not an exciting positive feeling about either option. ... I don't think people feel enough of a difference that they want to clamor and fight.\"\n\nClement said he worries that Republicans are doing a better job of reaching these ambivalent voters, especially through unofficial channels - like the \" manosphere \" of masculinity-centric podcasts and social media channels- that speak to the frustrations of younger Black men.\n\n\"Dealing with Black men who have been marginalized, who are trying to do the right thing, who haven't gotten success, who are still getting discriminated against when it comes to business and loans ― they're gonna feel kind of upset and frustrated,\" Clement said. He said the messages on these channels are \"right-wing talking points.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "What Does Being A Black Voter Mean To You Today?\n\nBlack Voices Editor/Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost\n\nSenior Front Page Editor, HuffPost\n\nSenior Culture Editor, HuffPost\n\nPhotos by Demetrius Freeman for HuffPost\n\nThis year marks the 150th anniversary of the ratification of the 15th Amendment, which gave Black men the right to vote. This year is also considered one of the most crucial presidential elections in recent history. A lot is at stake, especially for Black Americans who, despite being historically disempowered yet at the forefront of progressive movements, are often erased from in-depth conversations about the U.S. electorate.\n\nIn January, HuffPost traveled to Columbia, South Carolina, the first primary state with a significant Black population, to talk to voters about the most pressing issues on their minds before Saturday's contest. We talked to more than 30 people who had varying backgrounds, values, opinions and hesitations about the primary. The result was \"Black At The Ballot,\" a HuffPost multimedia project profiling Columbia residents whose stories dispel assumptions and stereotypes about Black voters.\n\nEach voter had a distinct story, but the common thread was a population yearning to be truly heard. We asked each of them what it meant for them to be a Black voter in 2020. Here's what 13 of them had to say about that significance.\n\n\"I'm so grateful that some of my grandparents are still alive and just knowing when they were younger they didn't have the right to vote or they got harassed for voting. I voted in local elections and I plan to vote in the presidential election. Every election matters to me because people died for me to have it and if I don't use my right to vote, then I can't complain. I think a lot of people forget that as a voter, especially me being Black, we have a lot more power than what we realize because we have the right and the power to elect our politicians that represent us and that we'll be able to pass legislation that will better our lives.\"\n\n\"Am I supposed to have any feelings? I just feel like it's something that I'm entitled to do so I take advantage of it. However, I can remember during my lifetime where there was a time when Blacks had to really almost fight to be able to vote, to register to vote. But as I said I feel like now that we have overcome that, that I am entitled to the privilege of voting, I take advantage of it. Even if it's just a little primary, I go right out there and vote. Sometimes I go it's not even in my district and they tell me, 'Oh, this is not your district, Mrs. Mack.' Oh, well I just heard you're supposed to vote, so I go and vote if they let me.\"\n\n\"I'm just exercising the right that I've always had. For me, the historical context doesn't hit quite the same as it would for my parents, because it's always been this way for me. I've always known that I had the opportunity to vote once I turned 18. I'm the type of person where if I know I can do something, when I actually do it, it's not that big of a deal. It just felt like a regular day, just voting, because I'm an American citizen. That's what I should do.\"\n\n\"It means a lot. My vote counts. And I just feel as though I'm doing what I can to just put us in a better position and make some change happen.\"\n\n\"That's the only thing we got that's supposed to be fair. That's it!\"\n\n\"I mean, one, of course, being an African-American male, we always didn't have a voice in regard to who our political leaders were. My vote has influence now and it can influence not just our present but the future to come, for generations to come. And so you never know exactly what one vote may do and how things would play out because of that.\"\"\n\n\"Being able to exercise the right to be able to vote, it's good. Just being able to go out there and be able to do my part and to be able to vote. It ain't really nothing like too extreme for me.\"\n\n\"I think being a Black voter right now, I think we hold a lot of weight. Honestly, I think if you can get the Black vote, you can get everyone else too. I think a lot of people have respect for what we have to say and who we tend to back, if that makes any sense. I think being a Black voter holds a lot of responsibility today and I think it will inspire change. I think we hold a lot of power in this election, for real.\"\n\n\"It means a lot because I could put my opinion in -  my voice. As soon as I could vote, I registered. My grandparents got me registered, and I voted. That means a lot to me.\"\n\n\"Makes me proud, first of all. But, it also allows us, we are aware now that our voices are being heard. And if young Black folks don't know that by now, this is the time. We are finally being heard, and I think voting is our biggest voice.\"\n\n\"It's just a civic duty. We have to teach our kids. I got three kids - three daughters - but it wasn't about Being Black to vote. You have to vote, in order for you to participate in the laws and in the government; you got to vote, you have to participate. So I never looked at it as just being a Black voter.\"\n\n\"I vote on behalf of the older generations, who have either died or fought or were unable to vote. And my vote carries the weight of those people, while also carrying the weight of the future. So I look at where we are as a society, where I'd like to see my children, the type of world I want to see my children in. So my vote is kind of a vote for two different generations.\"\n\n\"It's not something that I take very lightly. It's something that has not been afforded to me or people who look like me for long. And a lot more people who look like me still don't have the right to vote because they're in jail because of unfair laws. I feel like I'm not just voting for myself, and I just take that as an incredible privilege.\""

      "text": "Kamala Harris' Campaign Works To Reach Black Men With Voter Engagement Events\n\nSenior Front Page Editor, HuffPost\n\nVice President Kamala Harris ' campaign hosted a slew of events targeting Black men in Wisconsin this past week, part of an effort to drive turnout and prevent defections among a key voting bloc.\n\nOn Friday, former Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes led a rally at a major Black church in Milwaukee, before the campaign launched a canvas, gave out free haircuts at barbershops and hosted a happy hour for young professionals, wrapping everything up with a gospel brunch on Sunday.\n\nThe events illustrate how Democrats are increasingly targeting Black men, aiming both to counteract former President Donald Trump's efforts to woo them with machismo and social conservatism, and to try to ensure that apathy brought on by years of inflation and low approval for President Joe Biden won't result in low turnout.\n\nThe efforts are not limited to Wisconsin. In Michigan, a key state in the 2024 election, the Harris-Walz campaign has held more than 15 events since she announced her bid for president. The events have included barbershop visits and brunch events in cities like Detroit and Flint.\n\nThe campaign has hosted 10 organizing events in Black barbershops across Georgia, where Trump drew 11% of the Black vote in 2020 . It's also held events in Virginia and Pennsylvania, including a debate day event at a barbershop with local elected officials.\n\n\"From the moment Vice President Harris launched her campaign, we have hit the ground running to earn every single vote, including from Black men who we know will play a pivotal role in this election,\" Trey Baker, a senior adviser for the Harris-Walz campaign, told HuffPost.\n\n\"Whether it's having campaign officials join the #WinWithBlackMen call which raised over seven figures for the Harris-Walz ticket all while working to combat disinformation being targeted at Black men, to hosting genuine engagement events across battleground states, we are working day in and day out to earn Black men's vote,\" he continued.\n\nBlack voters, and Black men in particular, have consistently shown up for the Democratic Party for years. But large swaths of Black men have long felt their voices and needs haven't been heard or addressed. Republicans have worked to draw this key constituency away with voter outreach efforts of their own.\n\nThose efforts are often undermined by former President Donald Trump's own frequent invocation of stereotypes about Black people. In February, Trump said that Black Americans support him because they can relate to the \"discrimination\" he's faced in the legal system .\n\nA recent Washington Post-Ipsos poll found that Harris is enjoying strong support among Black men, but the race is still extremely tight in the states she needs to win . Baker, who headed up similar Black voter engagement events under Biden during the 2020 election, is working to ensure that Black men are being engaged by the Harris-Walz campaign.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Ronny Jackson (R-Texas), from praising his genetics .\n\n\"Some people just have great genes,\" Jackson told reporters in 2018. \"I told the president if he had a healthier diet over the last 20 years, he might live to be 200.\"\n\nSo it has been quite the show watching the gymnast-like contortions of the former president to avoid getting to know, or actually court, Black people to support his campaign.\n\nEarlier this month, in his latest episode of \"See? Black people like me!\" the president stood during an obvious photo-op at an Atlanta Chick-fil-A while smiling Black workers appeared to pose while taking his order. Trump reportedly ordered 30 milkshakes and some chicken, dealing out fast food for free publicity before heading to a high-dollar fundraiser in a largely white neighborhood.\n\nA Black woman in the restaurant said, in her best untrained actor voice, \"I don't care what the media tells you, Mr. Trump, we support you!\"\n\nI later found out the Black woman was in fact Michaelah Montgomery, a conservative activist who had arranged the entire scene. To her credit, the bigger story was supposed to be a conversation between students from nearby HBCUs and the presidential candidate about conservatism and possible inroads with the Black community.\n\nThe moment became a meme. As with most Trump moments. Because what Trump and those around him don't understand or care to involve themselves with is that Black people, more specifically Black women (also known as the spine of the Democratic voting bloc), are three dimensional, alive, actual human beings.\n\nIn Trumpland, Black people are caricatures of all of the worst stereotypes that have ever been imagined. They are rapists, thieves and murderers who want to terrorize... wait, no, that's immigrants . But the point remains: The idea of even possibly courting Black voters never moves past stereotypical ideology. Which is comical when you consider that in 2024, the year of our lord Dawn Staley, an actual presidential strategy for winning the Black vote was... wait for it... sneakers.\n\nIn February, Trump unveiled his $399 \"Never Surrender High-Tops\" at SneakerCon in Philadelphia . Trump didn't just premiere the gaudy gold high-top decorated with an American flag motif, the sort of faux patriotism that's truly become Trump's signature brand, he actually went to the event to help hawk the ridiculousness that was an attempt to capture not just youth culture but ... well, I'll just let Fox News contributor Raymond Arroyo say the quiet part out loud.\n\n\"This is ... connecting with Black America. Because they're into sneakers. They love sneakers. This is a big deal. Certainly in the inner city.\"\n\nArroyo got bashed for his take, as he should, but his take was a glimpse into how many Republicans, especially Trump, see Black people as sneaker-loving, inner-city dwelling and easily swayed by shiny, expensive things. It's Republican typecasting in which a Black person remains the villain/magical negro who serves only to further the white protagonist's storyline. And make no mistake about it, in the story of Trump, as told by the narcissistic narrator, the former president is always the hero.\n\nWhich brings us to Blacks 4 Trump (aka Black Voices for Trump), you know, that hodgepodge group of Blacks (mostly men) who have proclaimed their allegiance to Trump and who stump for him despite his lackluster attempts at any tangible metrics with the Black community. Don't act like you don't remember Michael Symonette, Maurice Woodside and Mikael Israel (these are not three people; it's one man who has gone by three names), more commonly know as \"Michael the Black Man\" (his name for himself, not mine) who magically appeared behind Trump at a 2017 rally in Arizona. Always strategically placed in the camera's view wearing a shirt that says \"Trump & Republicans Are Not Racist\" or \"Blacks 4 Trump.\" The funny thing is that the group Blacks 4 Trump didn't ever seem to really do anything other than allow their Blackness to be co-opted for the then-president's political gain. The group didn't have an agenda or a political manifesto (at least it never presented one) that noted how Trump could actually earn the Black vote. They just showed up and allowed their images to be used to sell a product.\n\nBecause, never forget, Trump is always in the Trump business.\n\nWhich leads to arguably the most disturbing attempt by Trump's campaign to court Black voters, which Trump's camp openly admits they need to win over in the upcoming election: Insisting that because Black people have been the victims of an unjust criminal system, they relate to Trump more because he, too, is a victim of the Man.\n\nSpeaking at the Black Conservative Federation gala on Feb. 23 in Columbia, South Carolina, Trump claimed that Black people like him more now because he's been indicted and has a police mug shot.\n\n\"A lot of people said that's why the Black people liked me, because they had been hurt so badly and discriminated against. And they actually viewed me as I'm being discriminated against. ... Maybe there's something to it,\" he said.\n\nThere isn't. There never was. There never will be.\n\nFirst, I didn't know that there were enough Black conservatives to make up a \"federation.\"\n\nSecondly, the president does a lot of sinister musings in these few sentences, so let's take this slowly.\n\nTrump acknowledges that there is discrimination and, more important, that Black people have been discriminated against. This means nothing to him, of course, as that only serves to get him to his second point, which is that he can relate, which therefore makes him more relatable to the discriminated class. He doesn't want to fix the problem, he only wants to leech off of the sympathies related to it. It is in this brushstroke that Trump ― who has been charged by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, a Black woman; Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Black man; and New York Attorney General Letitia James, a Black woman ― that he, too, is a victim of systemic racism.\n\n\"When I did the mug shot in Atlanta, that mug shot is number one,\" Trump said. He added that the Black population \"embraced it more than anyone else.\"\n\nHe also said: \"I'm being indicted for you, the Black population.\"\n\nFirst, the obvious. I'll just let President Joe Biden's campaign spokesperson Jasmine Harris explain it.\n\n\"The audacity of Donald Trump to speak to a room full of Black voters during Black History Month as if he isn't the proud poster boy for modern racism. This is the same man who falsely accused the Central Park 5, questioned George Floyd's humanity, compared his own impeachment trial to being lynched and ensured the unemployment gap for Black workers spiked during his presidency,\" Harris told The Washington Post .\n\n\"Donald Trump has been showing Black Americans his true colors for years: an incompetent, anti-Black tyrant who holds us to such low regard that he publicly dined with white nationalists a week after declaring his 2024 candidacy.\"\n\nYep, everything she said and also, What does \"I'm being indicted for you, the Black population\" mean?\n\nIs Trump claiming that he's being sacrificed for the sake of Black people? Is he alleging that the 88 charges in his four criminal indictments are because he was such a champion of the Black community that he had to be taken out? Is Trump implying that he's being crucified like, oh, I don't know, the great religious leader who died on a cross? That couldn't be what he means.\n\nWell, he used the same line during a February speech in Tennessee before the National Religious Broadcasters Association, in which he claimed, \" I'm being indicted for you. \"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Because Trump so loved the world, he was indicted for us. All of us. And the strange part is I don't think he's being facetious. I believe that he actually believes this. I believe that he believes most of the things he spouts, but what's always been scary to me has been the number of people who believe him; the people who actually believe he's a billionaire and that he owns the buildings that bear his name. The people who believe that he's being railroaded and those who are willingly going to vote for him again. You know, those people who still believe that he's going to build a wall and get Mexico to pay for it. Or that hydroxychloroquine could prevent COVID-19 . Those people who will still argue that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.\n\nThere are obvious inroads that Republicans could make if they were actually interested in reaching the Black community. Obvious areas like student debt relief, economic inequality, systemic racism and police reform. But that would require a level of humanity that I'm not sure Republicans have. It would mean that Republicans would have to actually have to learn about Black folks instead of destroying, hiding and whitewashing the history that made them. And why do that when you can easily cast Black people as the villains of your hero narrative, in which they remain flat, barely two-dimensional, distorted and exaggerated drawings that love some wildly overpriced ugly sneakers and have a penchant for criminality so strong that they find an accused criminal's mug shot endearing."

      "text": "Why The Democratic Right To Vote Is An American Myth\n\nOpinion Editor\n\nAmerica is trying to make Black people quit.\n\nIf you have to ask what aspect of \"America\" is doing this, it's the racist part - the kind that shouts and the kind that whispers. And if you have to ask \"quit what,\" that's a good question. Because one could argue America has been trying to get Black people to \"quit\" all sorts of things - from learning their history to existing . But for today's latest in \"America is trying to make Black people quit,\" we're talking about voting.\n\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court restored the highly contested and racist redrawing of an Alabama map that would serve Republicans looking to regain control of Congress in the Nov. 8 midterm elections. The high court's decision halts a lower court finding that the new map would likely discriminate against Black voters.\n\n\"A panel of three federal judges on Jan. 24 ruled that the map unlawfully deprived Black voters of an additional House district in which they could be a majority or close to it, likely violating the Voting Rights Act, a landmark 1965 federal law that prohibited racial discrimination in voting,\" Reuters reported.\n\nThis is gerrymandering at its finest. About every 10 years, whichever party is in power often gets to redraw district lines to help ensure victory or hurt those running against them. It's completely legal and has been since 1842 . It's basically a legitimate way for politicians to move the goalposts whenever they see fit, unless, of course, it's racist. The Supreme Court found in 1995 that racial gerrymandering is against the law. Still, the law didn't consider that the Supreme Court would have a problem determining whether or not the newly drawn map is, in fact, racist. And that is the beauty and the subtlety of racism: Even when it's obvious, it can still be hard to prove.\n\nSo let's say, hypothetically, you are a Republican in a state like Alabama. You know that Birmingham, Mobile, Huntsville and Montgomery have the highest populations of Black people. You can redraw the map so that all four cities are in the same district and therefore cancel out the Black vote. You know that you will lose this new powerhouse Black district, but you can gain everywhere else. There is even a term for it - it's called \"packing .\"\n\nBecause \"America\" doesn't want Black people to vote. And it never has. In 1870, the 15th Amendment gave voting rights to all men. This included Black men, but they couldn't actually vote because of all kinds of bureaucratic red tape, like poll taxes and literacy tests. And for those who could scrape together enough money to pay a poll tax and learn to read under the unforgiving flicker of candlelight, there were armed white men at the polling stations to scare those with the courage to try to vote. Today, America uses limits on who can vote by mail and increased criminal penalties for those who misunderstand election laws . For the past 20 years, America has worked tirelessly to keep people of color from the voting booth. According to the Brennan Center at New York University , this country has used all kinds of evil tactics, including \"imposing strict voter ID laws, cutting voting times, restricting registration, and purging voter rolls.\"\n\n\"In 2016, pummeled by voter suppression in more than 30 states, the black voter turnout plummeted by seven percentage points,\" Carol Anderson, author of \"One Person, No Vote: How Voter Suppression Is Destroying Our Democracy,\" told The Guardian . \"For the GOP, that was an effective kill rate. For America, it was a lethal assault on democracy.\"\n\nAnd states continue to adjust the voting laws every year based on Black voter turnout. In 2020 - during the pandemic, I might add - Black voters showed up in record numbers. Because there were several questions about \"voting integrity\" (blame Donald Trump and his Custer's Last Stand of election lies), many Black people didn't believe in the security of mail-in voting and wanted to cast their vote in person. Voting rights groups organized transportation to get voters to the polls, and someone - guess who - didn't like that. Michigan lawmakers made the practice of giving rides to voters to the polls illegal for anyone who can walk .\n\nAmerica likes to pride itself as a democracy; it isn't. For Black people, it's an authoritarian state that continues to suppress the Black vote and unjustly punish those who don't understand all of the confusing laws before them.\n\nAmerica has the lowest voter turnout rate among any of the developed countries , and that's not by accident. America wants it this way. Lower turnout almost always affects Democrats. So no matter how ridiculous the laws are in your state, learn them. Find out if your state offers automatic voter registration (19 states plus the District of Columbia do) and do that. Find out exactly what is needed to vote in person so you don't have to go home and return later to vote. Have a plan on voting day so that you know when and where you can vote. Arrive early and bring your own water. If you are Black and have been convicted of a felony and are working to get your voting rights back, make sure everything is in place before you register because America is unkind to Black people who make mistakes.\n\nT ake Pamela Moses, a Black Memphis activist who was convicted in November 2021 for registering to vote as a person who'd had a felony conviction. The whole thing was a misunderstanding. A judge initially told Moses that she wouldn't be able to vote because she was still on probation. Believing that the judge was wrong, Moses contacted her parole officer and explained her position. The officer agreed with her and even signed documentation stating that Moses was no longer on probation. Moses believed that this allowed her the right to vote, and considering that the court never notified voting officials to remove Moses' name from their list of registered voters, she believed she was fine. But, get this, Moses didn't get to actually vote; she merely registered to vote.\n\n\"I did not falsify anything. All I did was try to get my rights to vote back the way the people at the election commission told me and the way the clerk did,\" she said during her Jan. 26 sentencing, WREG-TV Memphis reported.\n\nThe judge didn't believe her. To the judge, Moses was trying to game the system, and for that he sentenced her to six years in prison.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Think about that number six - six years, the same amount of time someone could get for involuntary manslaughter in most states - and add your age to it, and then try to tell anyone how this makes sense. Tell them how purposefully eliminating voting polls in Black neighborhoods , knowing it will increase waiting times while also effectively banning the handing out of water , is not draconian. Tell them how gerrymandering - a fail-safe mechanism to ensure that the ruling class can merely recalibrate its way to more power - to cancel the Black vote isn't putting a thumb on the scale. Tell them how America is a democracy for some and a failed state for everyone else. Tell them how if you can legislate away the Black vote, why would anyone think it would just stop there? Why not make it harder for everyone? Why not make it impossible? Why even vote at all?\n\nAnd that's what is meant by American trying to make Black people quit. Perhaps our nation's democratic legacy is more mythology than reality, considering even the law doesn't seem to uphold it."

      "text": "Will Elizabeth Warren Be Able To Convince Black Voters She's Their Woman?\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nCOLUMBIA, S.C. ― Monty Bell entered the halls of the South Carolina Democratic Party convention in June firmly entrenched in former Vice President Joe Biden 's camp.\n\n\"I've always liked him,\" said Bell.\n\nBut by the time Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) wrapped up her six-minute speech at the Columbia Metropolitan Convention Center , the 38-year-old state delegate wasn't quite as sure.\n\n\"Warren was very impressive,\" Bell said afterward. \"She definitely gave me something to think about.\"\n\nAfter stumbling in the early months of her presidential campaign, the Massachusetts senator has shoved herself back into the race with policy specifics, promises to forgo big-money fundraising tactics, and energetic and selfie-filled town halls. During the second quarter of the year, Warren steadily rose in national and early-state polls and raised $19.1 million , more than three times as much as she had in the prior three months.\n\nBut for the Warren campaign to stand a chance of winning the Democratic nomination next year, she'll likely have to fully convert black voters like Bell, an increasingly critical, powerful and decisive voting bloc in the Democratic primary process.\n\nBlack voters now comprise more than 20% of Democratic primary voters and often put the vast majority of their political weight behind one presidential candidate ― two factors that together give them recognizable power in the party. \"If you can't compete strongly for African American votes, you're not going to be the nominee,\" said Cornell Belcher, a former pollster for the Democratic National Committee and Barack Obama's 2008 and 2012 campaigns.\n\nIt's still early. But so far, Warren's message hasn't resonated widely with the black electorate. In the early primary state of South Carolina, which has historically served as a harbinger of the larger black vote, Warren is currently polling at just 2% among black Democrats , according to a recent poll out of Monmouth University. Other national polls have also shown Warren polling in the single digits with black Americans ― often well behind Biden and Sens. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).\n\n\"She's got a tough road, and there is no shortcut to the front of the pack,\" said Theodore Johnson, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice who studies black voting behavior.\n\nFor a number of reasons, Warren entered the presidential contest at a disadvantage compared to her three fellow front-runners, according to Johnson: Biden and Sanders each came into the race with an \"established reputation in black America\" and more of an \"inherent trust\" among black voters. Harris has \"the shared lived experience that allows her to make cultural appeals in a way that others can't,\" as well as the ability to offer \"descriptive representation,\" meaning that she herself is a woman of color.\n\n\"Warren has neither of those things,\" Johnson said.\n\nBut by making racial inequity a central part of her campaign, Warren has made inroads with political activists and strategists of color. She released plans to address the racial wage gap , wealth gap , maternal mortality gap and \" startup capital gap .\" She proposed banning private prisons , paying reparations , legalizing marijuana , canceling most people's student debt and making historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) tuition-free. And she didn't shy away from her own personal story ― that of a college dropout and onetime single mother whose life was turned around by a selfless aunt and a commuter college that only cost $50 a month.\n\nAt presidential forums hosted by the Black Economic Alliance in Charleston, South Carolina, and She the People in Houston, Warren received standing ovations, impressing attendees with her penchant for specifics and ability to connect on a personal level.\n\n\"A lot of people in that room were surprised like, 'Wow, OK,'\" said Aimee Allison, the founder and president of She the People, a political group that seeks to elevate women of color. \"For her to make her case so powerfully ― and to win over women of color in that room ― demonstrated that she's got staying power.\"\n\nIn June, almost half of political activists and strategists of color listed Warren as their top candidate when polled by She the People. It was one poll, but it served as evidence of a swift and remarkable shift. The previous December, only one-fifth of the same group even listed Warren in their top three .\n\nThe critical question for Warren and her campaign now becomes whether that newfound enthusiasm among the political class will translate to the black electorate.\n\n\"Black activists is one thing,\" said Yvette Simpson, chief executive of Democracy for America, a progressive political action committee. \"But we always joke, does Rae-Rae know who you are? Does the everyday person know who you are?\"\n\n\"Black activists is one thing. But we always joke, does Rae-Rae know who you are? Does the everyday person know who you are?\"\n\nWarren established her genuine concern for inequities specific to black Americans long ago. As a Harvard professor studying debt and bankruptcy, she repeatedly argued that discrimination put black middle-class families at a higher structural risk of financial collapse than white middle-class families. In a 2003 book, she and her daughter referred to subprime lending and paydays loans as \" legally sanctioned corporate plans to steal from minorities .\"\n\nTa-Nehisi Coates has said Warren is the only presidential candidate who reached out to discuss the idea of reparations with him . A few years back, Warren also reached out to meet with Rashad Robinson, the president of Color of Change, a civil rights advocacy organization. He immediately noticed that she did not bring along any staff, unlike many of her peers.\n\n\"To me, that showed a real command of the information and a real comfort with each of the areas that we covered,\" he said. \"From bail reform and criminal justice to, of course, the economy.\"\n\nBy 2015, Warren's support for black Americans had become increasingly clear for those who wished to see it. That year, she took a strong stand in support of the burgeoning Black Lives Matter movement, which The Washington Post called \"perhaps the most full-throated endorsement to date by a federal lawmaker.\" Activist DeRay Mckesson said Warren understood the cause \"better than any political leader I've yet heard.\"\n\nEven still, some of the strategists and activists who are supportive of Warren acknowledged the difficulties she'll face in winning over black voters. Jamecia Decre, a Democratic strategist, personally appreciates Warren's ability to court \"black voters without pandering to them,\" but said there are a number of \"assumptions\" that the former Harvard professor will have to overcome in the black community.\n\n\"I don't know any other way to put it outside of the fact that she's a white woman,\" she said. \"There's just a lack of trust between white women and black folks in general.\"\n\nBuilding up that trust is possible ― after all, Hillary Clinton earned 77% of the black vote in 2016 ― but it also takes time, activists and strategists of color said. At the Black Economic Forum in Charleston in June, Robert, who declined to give his last name, said he hadn't heard of Warren until the 2016 election.\n\n\"If I don't hear about you until these times like this, what are you doing for me?\" he asked.\n\n\"I'm not with Elizabeth,\" Michael Yates, a 36-year-old former Marine and member of the Ashley Cooper Young Democrats, said at the South Carolina convention. \"I see her on TV. I hear her. But you know how somebody just ― I don't think you understand where I come from.\"\n\nWarren may have inadvertently made things harder for herself among certain groups of black voters by positioning herself as an aspirational candidate. Warren ends many of her stump speeches by declaring \"Let's dream big, fight hard - and win!\" But older black voters, in particular, are generally more drawn to established candidates they perceive as most likely to preserve past civil rights gains, Johnson and others said.\n\n\"You can't risk it on a radical or a dream candidate,\" Johnson said, explaining the thought process around picking a candidate. \"You have to use it very practically so that you can marshal the power of the black electorate to at least maintain gains that have been realized to date ― or make some incremental progress.\"\n\n\"It's always been true in the black community that we tend to not necessarily always vote with our hearts,\" agreed Gilda Cobb-Hunter, a longtime state legislator in South Carolina.\n\nJohn Cusack, a retired 70-year-old from Florence County, South Carolina, said he admires Warren's courage and willingness to \"tell it like it is.\" But after Clinton's loss in 2016, he has reservations about selecting a woman or a person of color as the nominee in 2020.\n\n\"She may be a little more brash than some people would like to accept,\" Cusack said. \"America still hasn't come to grips with black leadership, female leadership.\"\n\nInstead, Cusack is reluctantly considering voting for Biden. \"He's a recognized name for the Democratic Party,\" Cusack said.\n\n\"America still hasn't come to grips with black leadership, female leadership.\"\n\nWarren has hired more than two dozen staffers in South Carolina and made six visits to the state so far. Carol Fowler, the former chair of the South Carolina Democratic Party, said that people have been impressed with Warren when she has visited, but added that other candidates, like Harris and Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), have developed a stronger presence in the state so far.\n\n\"She's not neglecting us, but I do think South Carolina Democrats feel like they've gotten to know some of the other candidates a little better,\" Fowler said.\n\nStrategists, politicians and voters in South Carolina and elsewhere told HuffPost that Warren needed to go further, especially in rural South Carolina communities. Multiple people pointed to Obama's 2008 campaign in South Carolina as a blueprint. Back then, Clinton held a commanding lead in early South Carolina polls, including among black voters.\n\n\"We knew Hillary Clinton,\" said Kambrell Garvin, 27. \"I can recall being a high school student. And folks told me I was crazy when I said that Barack Obama could win.\"\n\nBut Obama committed to touring the state anyway, especially after his victory at the Iowa caucuses. \"Obama went to every little small city in South Carolina,\" said Sandino Moses, a 44-year-old teacher's assistant in Charleston. \"He visited all the HBCU colleges. He went to every town hall meeting he could go to. He went places I've never been before. And I live in South Carolina.\"\n\nIn the end, Obama took 44 of 46 counties in the state's Democratic primary and garnered 55% of the vote.\n\n\" These folks need to know that you care. They need to hear your heart,\" said Simpson of Democracy for America. \"They don't want the data. They want you to hear their story.\"\n\nNationally, Warren has been \"conducting a master class\" in reaching out to the broader black electorate in spite of the disadvantages she faces, said Johnson, mirroring the opinions of others. Warren has surrounded herself with some of the \"best operatives of color\" in politics, according to Bakari Sellers, a former South Carolina state legislator who has endorsed Harris. Since 2018, she has visited states including Alabama, Georgia and Mississippi ― as well as five HBCUs ― and held listening sessions with community leaders, as in Philadelphia ahead of the Netroots Nation convention in July.\n\nAt the second set of Democratic presidential debates in Detroit, when asked about the rise of white nationalism, Warren turned the conversation toward President Donald Trump, accusing him of \" advancing environmental racism, economic racism, criminal justice racism, [and] health care racism.\" It was critical, she explained, that Democrats tackle the specific issues of black Americans head-on.\n\n\"So my plan has universal tuition-free college for all of our kids, but also increases the Pell Grants and levels the playing field by putting $50 billion into historically black colleges and universities,\" she said. \"It cancels student loan debt for 95% of the kids with student loan debt and helps close the black-white wealth gap in America.\"\n\nWarren has also made a clear effort to personalize her message, said Johnson, the voting expert: \"There's always something personal to show that these positions she holds are not the end product of an academic exercise, but of a lived experience in an America that didn't do for her as a woman what it's supposed to do for all of us as Americans.\"\n\n\"These folks need to know that you care. They need to hear your heart. They don't want the data. They want you to hear their story.\"\n\nIn one instance, at Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network convention in New York this April, Warren connected her call for universal child care to her own struggles as a young mother and the support her aunt provided in a moment of personal crisis.\n\n\"One night, after I'd put both kids to bed, my 78-year-old Aunt Bee called long-distance from Oklahoma to see how I was doing. I said, 'Fine.' Then, with no warning, I started to cry,\" she said. \"Then Aunt Bee said 11 words that changed my life forever. 'I can't get there tomorrow, but I can come on Thursday.'\"\n\n\"Now, if every working mom in the country had an Aunt Bee, we'd all be good,\" Warren added. \"But think about all the moms in America who don't have an Aunt Bee.\"\n\nThat personal touch has worked occasionally. Joy Vandervort-Cobb, a teacher at the College of Charleston, found herself surprised by Warren at the Black Economic Alliance forum.\n\n\"I would never have attached to Sen. Warren the way ― oh my God, when she turned toward us, she was like, damn the camera, this is what I'm here for, this is what I'm about. I've got a plan for that. That, I thought, was beautifully done. She just went in, she went right at us,\" she said.\n\nCobb-Hunter, the South Carolina legislator, said that she's noticed a growing level of interest in Warren among black women in her state. It's too soon to say exactly why. But Warren has made the idea that the \" ultra-rich have rigged our economy \" a central part of her campaign, and black voters ― and young black women in particular ― are highly likely to agree with that idea, according to recent research by The Groundwork Collaborative, the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, and UnidosUS Action Fund.\n\nAmong the women who have been taken by Warren is South Carolina state representative Wendy Brawley, who recently endorsed the senator. Brawley said that she appreciated the extent to which Warren talks about \"family economics\" and child care.\n\n\" All of the plans that she has talked about it in her campaign are ones that are relevant to everyday people, that would actually help everyday people who struggle every day trying to make ends meet,\" said Brawley.\n\nFor now, Biden retains a dominant lead with the black community, especially in South Carolina, where 51% of black voters listed him as their top pick in the latest Monmouth poll. But Temple Robinson, a 40-year-old stay-at-home mom and undecided voter, said there is something of a generational divide between older and younger black voters in South Carolina when it comes to Biden.\n\n\"The older people love him,\" she said. \"I don't necessarily know how well he has connected to people who are 40 and under.\"\n\nThis primary season, Cobb-Hunter believes the black electorate will \"fracture\" more than in the past, both because of the large number of Democratic candidates and because of an influx of new issues-based voters. Should that happen, there are signs Warren could make inroads within the black community. In a May poll conducted by BlackPAC, Warren performed significantly better with black voters who are paying close attention to the news ― and almost as well as Biden.\n\n\"Everybody, I think, firmly believes that Biden is in the lead. But when they talk about what's next, I'm hearing a lot of Elizabeth Warren,\" agreed Todd Rutherford, South Carolina's House minority leader.\n\nKenneth Glover, the Democratic Party chair of Orangeburg County in South Carolina, said that Warren's focus on student loan forgiveness and free college has also been \"resonating\" with a lot of young people in his community. Numerous young black voters said the same.\n\nOne young South Carolinian who has been taken by Warren is Garvin, who is now a 27-year-old member of the South Carolina House of Representatives. In July, he decided to endorse Warren alongside Brawley, much to his own surprise.\n\n\"When the process started a couple of months ago, Elizabeth Warren was not even on my list of candidates that I was intending to support,\" he said.\n\nBut Garvin appreciated her detailed policies, her warmth and her \"down-to-earth\" nature. He now believes the 2020 primary will mirror the events of 2008, when he was that high school kid crazy enough to believe a black senator from Illinois stood a chance.\n\n\"There is a divide between some of my older colleagues and myself in regards to who we want to see elected and become president,\" Garvin said. \"But I don't think that is a divide that Elizabeth Warren can't overcome.\"\n\nJulia Craven and Igor Bobic contributed reporting."

      "text": "'Don't Vote' Campaigns Played A Big Role In Black Voter Decline\n\nScholar\n\nThe Pew Research Center recently reported that the Black voter turnout in the 2016 election declined for the first time in 20 years \"falling to 59.6% in 2016 after reaching a record-high of 66.6% in 2012\". A convincing argument can be made that this is largely due to the fact that Barack Obama was no longer on the ballot and voter suppression efforts like the reduction of acceptable forms of voter ID, absence of early voting in some states, and the reduction in the number of polling places. These are among the significant structural challenges that have been exacerbated in the first election without the full protection of the 1965 Voting Right Act. These threats to our system of voting that must be addressed and vigorously contended against.\n\nA seldom discussed additional reason for the reduction in Black voter turnout is the \"don't vote\" rhetoric of several prominent Black Americans who encouraged Black people not to vote in the 2016 election. This is likely to have been a contributing factor to the first decline in Black voter turnout in 20 years. It cannot be overlooked as we continue to analyze the results of the 2016 election. This must also be addressed if the low Black voter turnout trend is to be reversed.\n\nThe individuals who promoted some version of a \"don't vote\" campaign did so through a number of different means. Some were not happy with having Hilary Clinton as the Democratic nominee and thus framed her candidacy as being the same as that of Donald Trump . Some felt that President Obama didn't do enough for Black people and thus encouraged people to disengage from the political process. Others felt like that Democratic Party had taken the Black vote for granted and signaled that not voting would teach the party a lesson. There were also those who were cynical enough to believe that their vote wouldn't make a difference.\n\nThe bottom line is that it wasn't just voter suppression that led to a sharp decline in Black voter turnout. The rhetoric of those who encouraged the Black electorate not to vote also played a significant role. Scholars like Dr. Eddie Glaude of Princeton University consistently campaigned for Blacks to not vote for the Presidency in the 2016 election. A large part of it seemed to be linked with a dissatisfaction with Hilary Clinton. As flawed of a candidate as she was, a non-vote was essentially a vote for Donald Trump.\n\nGlaude, the Chair of the Center for African-American Studies at Princeton University, recently tweeted his disdain for Trump and highlighted voter suppression efforts in Wisconsin and other states. What Glaude did not mention is his campaign to discourage Black people from voting for the Presidential portion of the election in the run up to Election Day.\n\nIf Glaude is as dissatisfied with the actions of the Trump administration as he claims to be then it was irresponsible of him to use his national platform to tell Black voters to neutralize their political power by not voting. The consequences of having Trump in office could potentially be catastrophic. For a tenured Professor with health insurance to encourage people who gained access to health care through Obamacare to relinquish their political power is questionable. This mentality highlights an issue with some Black academics of a growing disconnect between the world of abstract theory \"and the everyday struggle of the Black masses.\" Politics and elections have real world consequences, especially for the most vulnerable.\n\nOther Blacks with sizable platforms also did their part to encourage a low Black voter turnout by explicitly advocating for people not to vote or implying that it wouldn't make any difference if Blacks didn't vote. Some of the prominent figures who engaged in this support of voter apathy included Colin Kaepernick, Dr. Boyce Watkins, and Nick Cannon among others. These individuals certainly do great work in other areas, but their potential influence over some segments of the Black electorate was not helpful for voter turnout.\n\nIronically, many proponents of the \"don't vote\" campaign are now complaining about Donald Trump. Elections have serious consequences. We can't afford to sit them out. This election was not a time to be teaching a particular political party a lesson when the alternative was an incompetent and dangerous candidate like Trump.\n\nThough their intentions may have been good, the consequences of promoting this \"don't vote\" campaign will be devastating. The House just passed a version of health care reform that would strip over 24 million Americans of coverage.\n\nAttorney General Jeff Sessions released guidance this week calling for the harsher sentencing of low-level drug offenders and thus doubling down on the War on Drugs. The announcement by the Trump administration of a new voter integrity commission indicates that more voter suppression efforts are likely on the way. These are just a few of a laundry list of Trump administration measures that will have an adverse impact on Black people.\n\nThe false equivalence of Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump that was consistently purported by some undoubtedly gained steam and became embedded in the minds of many voters. There was a clear difference between the two candidates. We will now be living with the consequences of a lack of nuance and understanding of the ramifications of the consequences of a Trump administration for four years.\n\nI want to emphasize and underscore that the structural barriers of our current voting system like the electoral college format, lack of universal automatic and online voter registration, felon disenfranchisement, reduction of acceptable forms of voter ID, absence of early voting in some states, gerrymandering, and reduction in the number of polling places are more significant impediments than the \"don't vote\" rhetoric of certain people. In a close election, however, the internal \"don't vote\" movement undoubtedly made a difference. It was a contributing factor to why Donald Trump is now the leader of the free world.\n\nWe must vigorously fight voter suppression efforts, but we must also denounce the \"don't vote\" narrative. Those who engaged in this kind of rhetoric bear a portion of the responsibility for Trump being in the White House. It will now be that much harder to motivate the Black electorate to turn out for important local and state elections that will take place this year and in 2018. We have to find a way to turn the corner in the area of voter engagement and turnout or we will see the loss of the hard fought victories won by the blood, sweat, and tears of those who came before us.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Charles Barkley Got It Right: Democrats Need to Respect the Black Voters Putting Them in Power\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nBlack voters are the Democrats' most supportive demographic, yet African-Americans are largely absent in positions of political power.\n\nCharles Barkley, the NBA Hall of Famer and award-winning sports commentator known for his deep Alabama roots, ditched the Republican Party and its bigoted candidate for the United States Senate, Roy Moore, to back the Democrat, Doug Jones. Jones ended up winning and Moore lost.\n\nAfter the announcement of the election results , Barkley had something of a moment. He was clearly elated and could be seen celebrating at Jones's victory party - cheering, high-fiving, hugging, and taking endless selfies with anyone who asked.\n\nIt wasn't all revelry, though. Barkley had some serious things to say - and as usual he didn't hesitate to say them. After Jones finished his speech, Barkley started talking to every news crew that would listen. One of the most important points he offered was his folksy critique of the Democratic Party.\n\nFormer NBA player and Alabama native Charles Barkley: \"This is a wake-up call for Democrats to do better for black people and poor white people\" https://t.co/D6ZnRJT3Um\n\n- CNN (@CNN) December 13, 2017\n\nBarkley's remarks about the Democrats came about in an odd way. CNN host Jake Tapper asked Barkley what his message for President Donald Trump would be. But Barkley took it in another direction:\n\nWell, this is a wakeup call for Democrats. ... They've taken the black vote and the poor vote for granted for a long time. It's time for them to get off their ass and start making life better for black folks and people who are poor.\n\nThey've always had our votes, and they have abused our votes and this is a wakeup call. We've got it in a great position now, but this is a wakeup call for Democrats to do better for black people and poor white people.\n\nWhile all indications are that poor white people in Alabama voted overwhelmingly for Moore in the election and show strong support for Trump in general, no voting bloc has been more faithful to the Democratic Party with less to show for it than African-Americans.\n\nAmong Alabama voters, an astounding 98 percent of black women cast their vote for Jones, according to exit polls. And 93 percent of black men who voted also cast their vote for Jones.\n\nNo other constituency or demographic came close to this type of support on either side. White men without college degrees, for instance, constituted Moore's strongest demographic of support -  but only came in at 79 percent support.\n\nFor Jones to narrowly eke out a win took near unanimous black support and turnout in black communities - support and turnout levels that appear to rival even former President Barack Obama's landmark 2008 election.\n\nBarkley is right that there's an imbalance in the way black folks turn out for Democrats like Jones versus the way those Democrats then turn around and treat them. Unlike Obama's election, the black vote is in essence used by Democrats to advance white politicians' power.\n\nConsider these facts: The United States does not have a single black governor of the 50 states; only one of the 50 states currently has an African-American attorney general; just two African-American Democrats serve in the United States Senate - two!\n\nAnd it's not just the politicians themselves, these imbalances are built into the power structures politicians have built around themselves, too. Every United States senator has a chief of staff. Guess how many of those are black? Two! And both of them are Republicans ! Each U.S. senator has a communications director; only one is black, and he also works for a Republican. Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez recently posted a photo of the last crop of interns to work for the party - and almost all the faces were white.\n\nThe problem runs from the rank and file all the way to the top of the national Democratic Party. The House minority leader is white and so is the Senate minority leader.\n\nThe disparity between the loyalty of black voters and Democrats' efforts to bring them into the circles of political and financial power extends to the way the party spends its money. Of the $759 million the Democratic Party spent on contractors back in 2010, a dismal 1.5 percent was spent on African-American groups .\n\nSo yes, Charles Barkley was right: \"They have abused our votes.\" It is abusive for the Democratic Party to require a level of support from African-Americans normally only seen in dictatorships, then proceed to put black folk at the back of every line in terms of leadership and policy.\n\nThe Democratic Party is clearly expecting a wave of support to carry them into power in 2018. There are already rumors that the political classes want to call it a \"blue wave.\" But there's a better name: the black wave. The reason is simple: The wave won't come at all without black votes. But like all large waves in the ocean, the Democrats better learn to respect the black wave that keeps their political hopes afloat: The days of black votes without black power need to come to an end.\n\nCorrection: Dec. 15, 2017 An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that there are no black attorneys general. Indiana's attorney general, Curtis T. Hill Jr., a Republican, is an African-American.\n\nTop photo: NBA Hall of Famer Charles Barkley looks on as Democratic senatorial candidate Doug Jones speaks during a get-out-the-vote campaign rally on Dec. 11, 2017, in Birmingham, Ala.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren't on the beat?\n\nThe kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable.

      "text": "Don't Tell Cable Pundits That Bernie Sanders Is Leading Nationally Among Black Voters\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nMSNBC pundits were so excited about Biden's win in South Carolina that they wrote off Sanders's national support among black and young people.\n\nAt 7 p.m. sharp, multiple networks called South Carolina for Joe Biden, breathing a collective sigh of relief.\n\nThe results, MSNBC's Rachel Maddow said, called the viability of Sen. Bernie Sanders's campaign into question. \"If anybody knows anything about winning the Democratic nomination and about what it takes for a Democratic nominee to win a general election, it is black voters,\" Maddow said. \"And if Sen. Sanders continues to underperform systematically with black voters, and if we see him get shellacked - not just beaten but shellacked tonight in South Carolina - because of his performance with black voters, that's an existential question about that nomination.\"\n\n\"I want every Democrat in the country to see what that looked like tonight: That is what winning looks like,\" celebrated James Carville, an old-time political operative MSNBC brings on to panic its viewers. \"That is the job of a political party. Not utopian fantasies, but winning elections.\"\n\n\"The single most important demographic in the Democratic Party spoke up tonight,\" said Carville on MSNBC, wearing a U.S. Marine Corps baseball cap. He said Sanders needs to answer for his lack of support in the state: \"We get all enamored, and tonight we were reminded of what and who the Democratic Party is.\"\n\n\"We cannot win unless we prove there's excitement in the African American community,\" said former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, an ex-head of the Democratic National Committee, on CNN, going on to endorse Biden officially on air.\n\nMaddow's, McAuliffe's, and Carville's point - which became a major theme of cable coverage for the night - is, in the abstract, undeniable: A Democratic presidential candidate who can't win the black vote can't win the nomination. But the cable analysis carried on as if the only available information on the preferences of black voters came from South Carolina. In fact, black voters nationally have regularly been surveyed and, recently, Sanders has taken the lead among the demographic - a fact that was, at best, only mentioned in passing.\n\nLast week, the Reuters/Ipsos poll found Sanders besting Biden by 3 percentage points nationally among black voters - certainly a relevant data point when considering whether Sanders can win among black voters. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found Biden up 2 percentage points among black voters, while the Hill/HarrisX poll had Sanders up by 9. A Morning Consult survey recently found Sanders beating Biden by 5 points among all black primary voters, and thumping him by a 3-1 margin among black voters under 45.\n\nIn other words, the national picture does not exactly portend a \"shellacking\" among black voters - important context that was kept from MSNBC viewers, who would be left to conclude that the same minority-voter problem that hobbled Sanders's campaign in 2016 remains a major obstacle. It simply isn't true.\n\nAfter SC, @maddow says that if Bernie Sanders \"continues to underperform systematically with black voters... that's a existential question.\"\n\nIn reality, among black voters, Bernie finished #2 in NV & is #1 nationally! He's systematically leading. ( https://t.co/3YdoKJh8sj ) pic.twitter.com/rAzQNpiNpT\n\n- Aaron Maté (@aaronjmate) March 1, 2020\n\nA handful of commentators, including former Sen. Claire McCaskill, a vituperative opponent of Sanders, acknowledged that South Carolina's results may not necessarily translate into victory for Biden nationwide. \"Unfortunately,\" said McCaskill on MSNBC, \"there aren't a lot of Jim Clyburns.\" Clyburn, an iconic civil rights leader and the uncontested party leader in South Carolina, as well as the number three Democrat in the House, endorsed Biden last week, giving his campaign the kind of boost that can't be replicated elsewhere.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThere are other reasons to suspect that Biden's campaign won't be able to sustain its high note after South Carolina. The state is one of the demographically oldest. According to CNN exit polls , 6 percent of voters were between the ages of 17 and 24, and 5 percent were between the ages of 25 and 29. Around 28 percent of voters in South Carolina were under age 45, compared to 45 percent in Iowa, 35 percent in New Hampshire, and 36 percent in Nevada.\n\nWhat's more, Biden spent an enormous proportion of his resources in South Carolina, which he hasn't done in Super Tuesday states or beyond, and is running low on cash.\n\nIn 2016, Sanders was truly shellacked in South Carolina, losing a two-way race to Hillary Clinton by nearly 50 points. She beat him among black voters 86-14, according to exit polls . This year's exit survey found black voters making up 57 percent of the electorate, with Biden winning 64 percent of that vote to Sanders's 15 and Tom Steyer's 13. (Steyer, who only performed as well as he did thanks to the millions he poured into the state, dropped out of the race as the totals came in.)\n\nEverybody else was shellacked: Sen. Elizabeth Warren won 5 percent of the black vote, Pete Buttigieg 3, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar zero. Fortunately for them, they were barely mentioned during the TV coverage.\n\nWhile MSNBC more or less omitted the forward-looking picture of the race, Fox News was more sanguine about Biden's chances. Ari Fleischer, former press secretary to President George W. Bush, played down what the win could mean for Biden in other states. Only one of the 14 races Biden will compete in on Super Tuesday have a demographic similar to South Carolina: Alabama. \"If he cannot win anywhere without huge numbers of African American votes, the upcoming battlefield is not favorable to him still,\" Fleischer said.\n\nFormer interim Democratic National Committee chair Donna Brazile told Fox News that Biden and other candidates now needed to show they could build a diverse coalition and bring the resources to compete in large and small states to amass delegates they need heading into the July convention. \"The name of the game is delegates,\" Brazile said. \"For Joe Biden, clearly this was a victory that he desperately needed today in South Carolina.\"\n\nOverall, Biden is trailing Sanders in a number of recent national polls from Morning Consult , Fox News , and Yahoo/YouGov . The same is true in California, the state with the most delegates, where a Monmouth University poll released last week showed Sanders with support from 24 percent of likely California primary voters, and Biden with 17 percent. A Los Angeles Times/Berkeley poll released this week showed Sanders leading with 34 percent of likely California primary voters, with Warren at 17 percent and Biden, who had led the poll in June, at 8 percent. \"Based on his 34% support in the poll, this state alone likely will give him well over 10% of the 1,991 delegates he would need to win the nomination at the national convention this summer,\" the LA Times reported .\n\nWith the votes nearly all counted, Biden was heading for roughly a 29-point win in South Carolina, with only Biden and Sanders claiming delegates to the national convention; none of the rest seemed likely to meet the 15 percent threshold.\n\nFor Biden, it was a big first win of his presidential race - of any of his three presidential races, in fact: He had never won a primary or caucus victory before. \"This is leap day, and he needed to leap back into this race,\" said former Obama campaign strategist David Axelrod on CNN. \"This could narrow down very quickly to a race between Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden.\"\n\nCorrection: March 1, 2020, 4:11 p.m. Due to an editing error, an earlier version of this story erroneously stated that Ari Fleischer coined the phrase \"axis of evil.\" The reference has been removed. The story also erroneously stated that Claire McCaskill works for One Country Project; she does not.\n\nWAIT!

Here's Why.\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nEven as Democrats ran up big numbers among suburban and college-educated voters, their support among voters of color eroded.\n\nIn 2016, in Starr County, Texas, one of the poorest areas of the country and 96 percent Latino, Hillary Clinton cleaned up, winning it 79 to 19 percent. Four years later, Joe Biden won that same county by just 5 points.\n\nYet the votes for Clinton and Biden were roughly similar: 9,246 in 2016 for Clinton and 9,099 for Biden in 2020. It was Donald Trump's numbers that surged, from just over 2,000 in 2016 to more than 8,000 this election. The county is home to around 43,000 voting-age eligible people, according to the census.\n\nSomehow, Trump managed to quadruple his vote total while Biden managed to lose a small amount of ground, even as turnout was up overall. It was a stark instance of a trend that dogged Biden across the country: Even as Democrats ran up big numbers among suburban and college-educated voters, their support among voters of color eroded. On Fox News, Tucker Carlson crowed that Starr County's shift was symbolic of an emerging populist Republican Party. \"People who make less are voting Republican in bigger numbers,\" Carlson said, saying the GOP was \"the party of wage earners.\"\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nThe exception was Arizona, a state called early on Tuesday night by that same Fox News, giving hope to Democrats that the race was far from over. Clinton won 61 percent of the Latino vote in the state in 2016, while early reports show Biden reaching 70 percent . And, in Arizona, there's a lesson for Democrats as they confront the erosion of what they expected to be their emerging coalition. Particularly in Maricopa County, a long-running organizing campaign against Sheriff Joe Arpaio pulled together a political constituency with its own motivations, community, and sense of identity. That constituency was primed not just to get out the vote but to flip Arizona blue.\n\nChuck Rocha, the architect of the Bernie Sanders campaign's Latino strategy and founder of the pro-Biden Nuestro PAC, said that Biden's success in Arizona was \"the perfect storm.\" The Biden campaign started spending big on TV ad buys early on and, though they were slow to ramp up Latino outreach efforts in the state, groups like Living United for Change in Arizona, or LUCHA, were doing the work on the ground . Rocha also believes that marijuana legalization being on the ballot was \"another driving force\" for Latino turnout.\n\n\"The Latino outreach started late,\" Rocha said. \"It could have been better, and we're lucky that Joe Biden caught up with his spending when he did, because the outside spending was not comparable. What we're seeing is a billion dollars that was spent talking to white persuadable voters and less than $24 million talking to Latinos for outside orgs.\"\n\nTrump's support among Latinos, specifically Cuban Americans, helped him in Miami-Dade County, the most populous in Florida. Early 2020 exit polls found that Biden won a little over half of Latino voters in the state, down from Clinton's 62 percent. In Georgia, Biden was up 16 percentage points among Latinos, compared with Clinton's 40 percent, and similarly down with Latino voters in Ohio, according to CNN .\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MattBruenig/status/1323825846365396992\n\nGroups of voters have moved in and out of parties for decades, yet leaders in both parties tend to think of groups that are part of their coalition as static. In the early 1900s, the Great Migration saw millions of Black people leave the South for northern cities. Once they arrived, Democratic machine bosses looked to tap into this new voting bloc, creating the beginnings of an awkward coalition. Republican leaders insisted that African Americans would never vote for a party of former slave owners, and took the Black vote for granted. By 1936, a majority of African American votes were cast for Democrats.\n\nDemocratic leaders today, meanwhile, argue that Trump's rhetoric around race is so toxic that it's inconceivable voters of color could move his way. But voters who are not actively engaged can't be counted on for decades.\n\nWe're independent of corporate interests - and powered by members. Join us.

Senate Bill 1070, as it's officially known, was the most punitive immigration law in the nation and led to a seismic shift in the politics of the state.\n\n\"[SB 1070] was a watershed moment for the state of Arizona, in the sense that it was so raw and so politically motivated in terms of making the immigrant community and Latinos, by obvious association, the target that it backfired,\" Rep.

      "text": "Dispatch From Mississippi: Biden, Sanders, and the Battle to Win Black Voters in the South\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nWhile the poorest, blackest, and most incarcerated states would seem to be fertile ground for Bernie Sanders, they've proven instead to be the most arid.\n\nOn a bright and blustery Saturday afternoon, three days before the Mississippi primary, the 36-year-old mayor of Jackson, Chokwe Antar Lumumba, approached a group of men drinking beers around a pickup truck outside the Head Turners Barbershop. Bearing the seal of his office on a black windbreaker, Lumumba solemnly informed the men they were in violation of city ordinances, triggering peals of laughter all around. Then Lumumba got down to business. He was there to generate interest in Bernie Sanders, and skepticism about Joe Biden, the presumed favored candidate of Mississippi Democrats.\n\nLumumba had arrived at the barbershop from a nearby Baptist Church, where he'd launched a Sanders volunteer canvass of the historic black community of Presidential Hill. While volunteers knocked on screen doors and left flyers on porches, he and another surrogate, the Miami-based organizer and educator Philip Agnew, hit the barbershops of north Jackson.\n\nLumumba and Agnew tag-teamed what can be a heavy lift in Mississippi: introducing Sanders and his platform, defending his electability, and reducing his opponent Biden to a man, as Agnew likes to say, with black friends but no black policies.\n\n\"Can you name one Biden policy?\" Agnew asked Head Turners' 60-something barber, Ron Davis. \"Being Obama's vice is not sufficient,\" he continued. \"He was chosen to balance the ticket.\" Lumumba and Agnew together sketched Biden's authorship of the 1994 crime bill and large back catalog of racist and borderline racist comments. One time, Lumumba recounted, Biden told him and other black mayors at a conference in Atlanta that black parents can't help with homework because they \"can't read or write.\"\n\n\"I just want to make sure you know who we're propping up,\" Lumumba said as the meeting winds down. \"We have a choice on Tuesday.\"\n\nThe taciturn barber didn't need much convincing that Sanders's moral economy sounded like a good thing. \"The rich getting richer, the poor getting poorer,\" he said. \"People working all their lives, they should be retiring, but still have to work. That's not right.\"\n\nBut his questions, and the questions from others in the shop, belied a wariness that can't be overcome in 20 minutes a few days before an election: Why isn't Sanders a Democrat? How can he offer free health care and tuition when the Republicans are cutting existing benefits? Isn't this a capitalist country?\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nWhile the poorest, blackest, and most incarcerated states of the country would seem to be fertile ground for Sanders, at least in the primary, they've proven instead to be the most arid. The Alabama primary was a repeat of the South Carolina vote that refueled Biden's campaign and sent Sanders's into a cross-country skid, and Mississippi will likely continue the pattern.\n\nIn 2016, there was no Mayor Lumumba in the barbershops arguing that Sanders deserves black votes and can beat the Republican, while the famous Democrat doesn't and can't. How that conversation develops will determine not just the viability of a Sanders nomination in 2020, but the long-term prospects of the multiracial, multigenerational social movement that was supposed to midwife it.\n\nOrganizer Philip Agnew, standing, addresses volunteers ahead of canvassing the Presidential Hills neighborhood of Jackson, Miss., on March 7, 2020.\n\nFrom the start, Bernie Sanders has said his candidacy can only succeed if powered by an unprecedented coalition of black, brown, and working-class voters - a magnetized juggernaut that could attract disaffected Americans in a virtuous cycle of self-perpetuating people power. While the campaign did bring in large numbers of Latinos, new Americans, and millennial black voters, South Carolina showed the limits of any coalition that is missing the older black voters who form a base constituency in much of the country. Biden sealed his victory there with 60 percent of the black vote, with no surge in new voters, a number that he increased to 75 percent a few days later in Alabama on Super Tuesday.\n\nNot much money is spent polling the Mississippi primary, but it's possible that Biden will end up with 80-plus percent of the vote, with black voters making up 70 percent of the electorate. If so, it will be the second time in four years that Mississippi has handed Sanders his worst loss with a message taped inside of it.\n\nWhat does that message say? Biden's resurgence produced a market for neat explanations of black political behavior. The narrative seems to have settled somewhere over the broad thesis that black voters, especially in the South, are generally risk averse and have good reason for being so. South Carolina Rep. James Clyburn's endorsement of Biden formalized the sense that, despite everything, Biden - with the familiar \"D\" next to his name - is the safest bet for a return to normalcy and a never-perfect status quo. Some white progressives find this rationale dismaying, given that Sanders performs well in head-to-head matchups against Donald Trump, and is running on a platform much more tailored to the needs of black communities across a range of issues, from health care to criminal justice reform. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio evinced this dismay when he suggested \"the Clyburn effect\" was a form of low-information false consciousness, echoing familiar Republican canards about black voters' generational allegiance to the Democratic Party. Somewhere, right now, terms are probably being negotiated on a controversial future bestseller called, \"What's the Matter With South Carolina?\"\n\nRelated Bloomberg Spent Millions to Buy Alabama Voters. But in Selma, He Wouldn't Talk to Them.\n\nThe pushback was just as swift. Black voters, a chorus of voices proclaimed, have as fine an appreciation for the limits, dangers, tragedies, and ironies of U.S. politics as anyone can. The Nation's Elie Mystal saw the South Carolina vote expressing the cynical judgment that Sanders was too good for us and that his presence in the general would hand Trump reelection - because \"most white people are selfish and cannot be trusted to do the right thing.\" In this view, the political risk antenna of older black voters is reliable and hard-earned. If it warns to take even money rather than bet everything on promises that won't be fulfilled, maybe there's a reason.\n\nBut if the default conservatism of this position is understandable, it's also dangerous and debatable, say Sanders supporters, not least for its failure to account for the urgency of the climate crisis. The Sanders campaign is based on a belief that a left supermajority can be formed, and that means finding ways to overcome resistance and win people over.\n\n\"Our organizing has fallen short in some ways with black folks across the South,\" Agnew said. \"We're purging the feeling that these people don't know what's real, because they do know what's real. They live real lives. They've been told some lies, so we need to be able to engage with it, to speak to people's anxieties and say, 'We're not the risky bet here.' We have the people, the volunteers, the energy. The path is uncomfortable and new, but it doesn't have to be scary. Our job is to engage with that on a real level, not talk down to them or call them low-information.\"\n\nOrganizers for Sanders say such engagement pays off in Mississippi the same as it would anywhere else, though the starting line may be a little farther back. The biggest obstacle to getting lifetime Democrats to question the party and imagine a new kind of politics is a lack of time and people, not just their \"risk averse\" natures.\n\n\"Many people we talk to are hearing about Sanders for the first time from us, or the only thing they know is that someone told them he is a communist,\" said James Hempill, a Sanders organizer and Jackson native. \"It's a question of having time to explain his program, address electability fears, and explain democratic socialism. But it's doable. I just met an older black lady who was leaving her house to go cook for the homeless. She cares about people, votes in every election - the kind of person you'd expect to know about Sanders and the primary. But she didn't. Not because she's dumb; she just didn't know.\"\n\nHempill racked up so many of these stories that when he started canvassing for six months ago, he decided, \"if we had two years to raise awareness, knocking on doors and having conversations, Bernie wins Mississippi in a landslide.\"\n\nOrganizer James Hempill holds up a pin indicating support for Sanders ahead of a canvassing event in Jackson, Miss., on March 7, 2020.\n\nSomething like a landslide occurred in February when Arekia Bennett, director of a Jackson nonprofit called Mississippi Votes, organized a \"people's caucus\" to draw campaign surrogates to the state. The vote attracted 130 locals and surrogates representing Sanders, Biden, Elizabeth Warren, and Mike Bloomberg. When Hempill arrived with a small group of Sanders supporters, he didn't like the look of it. \"It was mostly typical Biden voters - older black voters like my mom. We thought, 'This isn't our room.' But after the surrogates all spoke, Sanders won big in two rounds of ranked-choice voting.\"\n\nThe day after the caucus result, Lumumba endorsed Sanders - the first and only Mississippi Democrat with a statewide profile to do so. The pairing makes sense, as Lumumba is a rare Sanders-like figure in the Deep South. The son of a black revolutionary and activist turned lawyer and politician, Lumumba was elected on a progressive platform. He hosts people's assemblies in which residents help plan Jackson's municipal budget, which he calls a \"moral document.\" Even so, his Sanders endorsement raised eyebrows in Mississippi. \"Local reporters were like, 'The mayor of Jackson endorsed Bernie Sanders?' People don't expect Jackson to push against the system,\" says Hempill.\n\nToward the end of Saturday's barbershop tour, Lumumba and Agnew stopped in at a popular salon, Celebrity Hair Designs. None of the dozen or so stylists and customers knew much about Sanders, but they listened closely, and most seemed to like what they heard. When the salon's owner took the mayor outside to discuss the potholes on Medgar Evers Boulevard, Sanders's deputy campaign manager, René Spellman, stood up and described how the campaigns' economic policies would impact the lives of women. \"When you can go to college tuition- and debt-free, earn a fair minimum wage, and have a right to affordable housing, you can take risks and spread your wings,\" she said. \"If you're a stylist, please carry this message to your clients between now and Tuesday. We have a choice. There's a candidate that will fight for them.\"\n\nThe idea that a presidential candidate would propose student debt relief and a $15 minimum wage was a revelation for one of the stylists, Dominique Wash, a single mother who works several jobs and is finishing a B.A. that has her $60,000 in debt. \"It's so important that women get paid appropriately, so we can take care of our family,\" she said, finishing up a weave for a young CPA named Anita Bonner. Mississippi has no state minimum wage, and black women in the state earn just under 70 percent of the national median for black women.\n\n\"It's important the campaign comes around, people need to hear this,\" Bonner said. \"I was going to vote for Biden, but now I'm really wondering. I didn't know anything about the crime bill.\"\n\nThat bill - the Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 - hovered over the stage of the Alamo Theater the following afternoon. The Mississippi Prison Reform Coalition and the Sanders campaign co-sponsored a panel on the ongoing human rights crisis in the Mississippi prison system, anchored by the notorious facility known as Parchman Farm. Agnew stood on the dais, where he reminded the audience of the campaign's criminal justice platform, including the elimination of mandatory minimums, three strikes laws - \"everything that was a part of the crime bill that Joe Biden wrote. Joe Biden wrote. Joe Biden wrote. Everything that's a part of that bill.\"\n\nAs Agnew spoke, Biden was holding a rally on the other side of town with special guest Vivica Fox, a sitcom and soap opera actress - his first trip to Jackson during the race. Sanders was also scheduled to be in Jackson that weekend, but he canceled to focus on Michigan, where his Sunday rally featured his latest endorser, Jesse Jackson . Sanders has visited Mississippi twice in recent years. The first was in support of striking workers at a nearby Nissan plant, the second for an economic justice forum hosted by Lumumba on the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination. The New York Times reporter who covered the 2018 trip takes care to note that Sanders missed two chances to impress and connect with large black audiences. In an observation that now reads like a warning, he wrote that unless Sanders can \"remedy his most significant vulnerability in 2016\" - anemic support from black voters - he will \"find it nearly impossible to win the 2020 Democratic nomination.\"\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "How Black Voters Lifted Doug Jones Over Roy Moore\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nBlack activists in Alabama expected increased turnout in the Senate special election. And they got it.\n\nDothan, Alabama - The day after Doug Jones won the Democratic nomination for Senate, Dr. Joe Reed sat down to share his thoughts on the race with The Intercept. Reed, head of the Alabama Democratic Conference, is largely seen as the de facto leader of the Alabama Democratic Party, as most of the state executive committee is either an ally or member of the ADC.\n\nHe is, in many ways, the last true black party boss in the South. But the way Reed sees it, if a Democrat like Jones wants to win the Alabama Senate seat, he can't rely on black votes, he has to do his own work in the white areas.\n\n\"He's gonna have to campaign in white folks' districts himself,\" Reed said. As if on cue, his flip phone rang.\n\nIt was Doug Jones, calling to pay his respects.\n\n\"Now whatcha gotta do now,\" he lectured Jones, \"is get out on the road and tell Bubba and Cooter how important the Democratic Party is for them.\"\n\nHe rattled off the names of long-dead Democratic congresspeople and their accomplishments. \"If he's from around Huntsville, he oughta thank John Sparkman every day. If he got a student loan, he oughta thank Carl Elliott,\" Reed said. \"So go tell 'em what the Democratic Party has meant to them and meant to their parents.\"\n\nWhile Reed was comfortable delegating the white vote to Jones, he didn't leave anything to chance on his end. Reed's job was eased by Roy Moore, the Republican nominee, who toward the end of the campaign waxed poetically about the halcyon days of slavery, comments that got little attention at the time but began going viral last week. Asked by an African-American voter when he thought America was last \"great,\" he reached for the years before the Civil War. \"I think it was great at the time when families were united - even though we had slavery - they cared for one another,\" he said. \"Our families were strong, our country had a direction.\"\n\nPrecisely whose families were strong, and which were sold in pieces, was left unsaid, but it resonated nonetheless. Black activists in Alabama expected increased turnout in the Senate special election, in part due to those remarks. And they got it: Late Tuesday night, the Associated Press called the race for Jones, who won largely on the strength of black turnout.\n\n\"Roy Moore said the only time America was great was back when slavery existed, and we don't want nothing to do with that dude,\" said the Rev. Kenneth Glasgow, an activist in Dothan. \"That dude trying to make us slaves.\"\n\nGlasgow led a county-wide canvassing effort here in Houston County for Reed's Alabama Democratic Conference, the largest Democratic and black organization in Alabama. Old school tactics are being deployed to try to repair the turnout machine that was broken by the Republican waves of the early 2000s.\n\nTuesday afternoon, Glasgow and his friend Edward Jones set up grills outside polling stations. Buses, minivans, and taxicabs started taking people to the polls. In rural Escambia County, likewise, a Monday night fish fry served as an informal local gathering and a get-out-the-vote rally.\n\nThe effort was possible this election as opposed to previous ones, Reed said, because Jones's campaign made the decision to fund the ADC's get-out-the-vote efforts. Neglect a party base, and turnout falls off. Invest in it, and people will turn out. It may seem obvious, but the Alabama Democratic candidates hadn't done much of it in recent cycles.\n\nUnder the leadership of Reed and party chair Nancy Worley, the ADC and the Alabama Democratic Party have largely focused their efforts on preserving their seats in the cities and the Black Belt around Montgomery, much to the chagrin of some rank-and-file (mostly white) Democrats, like Rep. Craig Ford, D-Gadsden, who complains that Reed \"killed\" the party.\n\nReed, on Election Day, was unapologetic. \"I can't get white folks to vote Democrat. White folk gots to do that,\" he said, exasperated. \"It's much easier for whites to go out and embrace white Republicans; they go to church together, they go to school together, they go to sororities and fraternities together, they do all that stuff together. So it's much easier than to pick up the flag and say I'm gonna be a Democrat.\"\n\nThe ADC said that it was hoping for 50 percent turnout among the black community in Alabama; an improbable number but a sign of confidence from an organization that has seen setbacks in recent years. With the exception of President Barack Obama's campaigns in 2008 and 2012, the black vote has seen a steep decline in Alabama since the early 2000s.\n\nIt is an unavoidable reality that black enthusiasm has waned, says Dr. Earl Jones, the head of ADC's efforts in southeastern Alabama, and Glasgow's mentor.\n\n\"I consider it to be a function of learned helplessness on the part of black and poor people, particularly in Alabama and in rural areas,\" Jones explains. \"Their sons and daughters are being arrested. Look at the city jails, the county jails, the state jails, you see they're filled with people of color. ... And that learned helplessness evolved out of that. In other words, they said it's not going to make any difference anyway regardless to how I vote. And they've seen that in various ways, I would say.\"\n\nMoore seems to have been just enough to begin to reverse that.\n\nCNN EXIT POLL: Today's electorate in Alabama was 65% white, 30% black, 2% Latino. There aren't exit polls from 2016 but the 2012 presidential electorate was 68% white, 28% black, 2% Latino. Usually off-year elections and special elections have less diverse electorates, not more.\n\n- Marshall Cohen (@MarshallCohen) December 12, 2017\n\nAfter the election results came in, Earl Jones called black turnout performance \"phenomenal.\" Michael Jones, ADC's chair of the black belt county of Crenshaw, said that he had \"called it\" within a few thousand votes.\n\nThe Democratic nominee, Doug Jones, needed black voters to come out in higher numbers than they have in the past. Bob Vance nearly beat Judge Roy Moore in 2012 when he last ran for chief justice of the state's Supreme Court, but even then it was only with the massive turnout inspired by Obama's re-election campaign.\n\nNationally, of course, the conversation centered on Moore's penchant for molesting children as a prosecutor in his 30s. An exit poll found that 54 percent of voters said the allegations did not influence their vote, but, presumably, that number included many voters who had long ago made up their mind they would not vote for Moore, who has been twice removed from the bench.\n\nBut those who dismissed the allegations relied on a few mental exercises. Some blamed the \"fake news media\" for concocting them from whole cloth, while others claimed the women had been paid by George Soros to make the charges.\n\nIt is harder, though, to explain away Moore's own words. When asked by Sean Hannity if he ever remembered dating teenagers as a thirtysomething when he was deputy district attorney, he said, \"I don't remember ever dating any girl without the permission of her mother.\"\n\nWhen asked how he met his wife, he described seeing her perform at a ballet recital as a young girl. With no children of his own with him, Moore stood at the back of the auditorium and watched the girls dance, he said.\n\n\"When I was deputy district attorney, many years before we got married, I saw her at a dance recital. I was standing in the back of the auditorium and I saw her up front, and I remembered her name, Kayla Kaiser - K.K. - I remembered that. I didn't meet her, I left, and it was, gosh, eight years later, I met her.\"\n\nMoore told her he thought he knew her. \"She thought I was coming on and making it up, then I told her, and she identified the dance,\" he said.\n\nWhen they eventually married, she was 24.\n\nAt Moore's campaign event Tuesday night, the crowd was raucous as the results began to trickle in, showing the judge ahead in early voting. Someone in the crowd had to call for quiet as Janet Porter, the head of the Faith2Action, tried to lead the room in prayer. \"I thank God for Roy Moore,\" Porter intoned, \"who is the closest to a Founding Father I've ever seen.\"\n\nBut after the AP and the New York Times called the race, a visibly distraught Rich Hobson, Moore's campaign chief of staff, came on stage, declaring that the Moore campaign wasn't giving up yet. \"I wanna ask y'all to pray,\" Hobson implored the stunned audience.\n\nTop photo: Democratic senatorial candidate Doug Jones greets supporters after voting at Brookwood Baptist Church on Dec. 12, 2017, in Mountain Brook, Ala.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "\"We've Got People\": Ryan Grim on the Democratic Party, Nancy Pelosi, and the 2020 Campaign\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nIn this bonus episode, The Intercept's Ryan Grim joins for an extended conversation about his new book, \"We've Got People.\"\n\nAs Democrats continue to debate whether to initiate an impeachment inquiry, Trump seems to be going nuts from the Democrats' continuing probe into his possible obstruction of justice, corruption, abuse of power. The Intercept's Ryan Grim explains Nancy Pelosi's rise to power within the Democratic Party, her political origins, and what her possible end game strategy is for Trump. Grim also weighs in on the large 2020 Democratic candidate field and talks about his new book, \"We've Got People: From Jesse Jackson to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the End of Big Money and the Rise of a Movement.\"\n\nJeremy Scahill: This is Intercepted.\n\n[Music interlude.]\n\nJS: I'm Jeremy Scahill, coming to you from the offices of The Intercept in New York City. And this is a special bonus episode of Intercepted.\n\nJS: There is a very mild, collegial debate brewing among Democrats in Congress: to impeach or not. Calls are mounting for the opening of an impeachment inquiry and the effort now has the support of at least one Republican congressman, Justin Amash, the libertarian politician from Michigan.\n\nJustin Amash: Nonetheless we have a job to do and I think we owe it to the American people to represent them, to ensure that the people we have in office are doing the right thing, are of good character, aren't violating the public trust.\n\nJS: Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, has not shown any sign that she will back such a move imminently and she appears to be opting for a tactic of trying to drive Trump insane. She said this to reporters last week:\n\nNancy Pelosi: We do believe that it's important to follow the facts. We believe that no one is above the law, including the President of the United States, and we believe that the President of the United States is engaged in a cover-up, in a cover-up. And that was the nature of the meeting.\n\nJS: Trump then staged his massive tantrum and put on a performance of calling off a meeting with congressional Democrats about infrastructure and marching out to the Rose Garden to denounce the Mueller investigation and Nancy Pelosi, in general.\n\nDJT: I just saw that Nancy Pelosi just before our meeting made a statement that we believe that the President of the United States is engaged in a cover-up. Well, it turns out, I'm the most - and I think most of you would agree to this - I'm the most transparent president probably in the history of this country.\n\nJS: Trump seems to be going nuts from the Democrats' continuing probe into his possible obstruction of justice, corruption, abuse of power. And regarding Pelosi, the right-wing and Trump backers hit back. A doctored video featuring a slowed-down Nancy Pelosi went viral on social media. Rudy Giuliani and Trump himself shared that altered video. Trump also called Pelosi, \"a mess\" and Pelosi tweeted back, \"When the 'extremely stable genius' starts acting more presidential, I'll be happy to work with him on infrastructure, trade and other issues.\"\n\nNancy Pelosi is, of course, the top Democrat in Congress. She is the House Speaker, third in line to the presidency. Despite Trump controlling the White House and the GOP with a firm grip on the Senate, Nancy Pelosi is incredibly powerful, and it's important to understand who she is, how she rose to power, and what her endgame strategy with Trump might look like.\n\nTo discuss this, and the current state of the Democratic Party, I'm joined by my colleague Ryan Grim, The Intercept's DC bureau chief. Ryan has a new book out this week that provides an essential in-depth context for the political landscape that we're in now. It is called \"We've Got People: From Jesse Jackson to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the End of Big Money and the Rise of a Movement.\"\n\nJS: Ryan Grim, welcome back to Intercepted.\n\nRyan Grim: It's good to be here.\n\nJS: Congrats on the book.\n\nRG: Thank you.\n\nJS: Clearly Nancy Pelosi is in the news a lot lately and is going to continue to be in the news around this issue of impeachment and then her clearly getting under Trump's skin by saying that he's engaged in a cover-up. For people that don't know much about Nancy Pelosi - and you cover this in the book as you kind of trace the modern history of the Democratic party - what is the Nancy Pelosi story? How did she end up where she is in the third most powerful position in the U.S. government?\n\nRG: It's been fun to watch this precise moment because it's such an encapsulation of her career and not just who she is but like who her entire generation is. And so, she herself has a fascinating background. She was raised by a kind of mob-connected Congressman/Mayor of Baltimore. So, she learned, actual brass knuckles politics from a very early age then moved out west. And so, she has this like fighting, like actual fighting liberal sensibility that's quite rare. She turned out to have an extraordinary ability to raise money. And so while she was raising five children, she was also acting as a fundraiser for the party and kind of, working her way up through the party ranks in the 1970s and 1980s and she -\n\nJS: She wasn't in an elected position at that point?\n\nRG: Right, she actually ran for DNC chair at one point and barely lost to the guy who replaced Ted Kennedy in the Senate in a weird coincidence. But no she had not run for any elected office. She was a very much behind the scenes fundraiser/operative and she became very close with a guy named Phil Burton who was also known as a fighting liberal.\n\nHe was a guy who, he died early. He died in 1983 but if he had lived, he would've kind of changed the course of Democratic history. He was the kind of guy who was not only progressive but wanted to punch you in the face and also, was all about raising a ton of money and screwing Republicans. He basically invented gerrymandering in California and screwed Republicans out of a ton of districts there. Essentially, Pelosi is Burton's Lieutenant, kind of, an enforcer and a fundraiser back home. He dies in 1983. His wife takes over for him and serves four years. She then dies. On her deathbed, she endorses Nancy Pelosi to take her seat. So, now there's a special election in 1987. Her top opponent is the vice chair of the DSA, Democratic Socialists of America. Openly gay man running on basically: Reagan is ignoring the AIDS epidemic.\n\nJS: What is the position that Pelosi's running for at this point?\n\nRG: Congress.\n\nJS: This is her first run for a House seat?\n\nRG: First run for any elected office and she's running to replace kind of, her mentor and then her mentor's wife. And so it's a real establishment versus insurgent race. Nancy Pelosi likes to say that she's from the Bay Area and so she understands the left. That's true in the sense that she beat the left to win her seat. It's not that she organized support among the left, but she barely won. If they were using the current top two system, I think she would have lost her first seat and there would be no Nancy Pelosi.\n\nBut she wins in 1987. She joins Steny Hoyer who'd been there for a while already and a class of Democrats who came in in the late 70s and 80s, just as the party was ending. And in 1980, not only did you have Ronald Reagan elected and have him re-elected in 1984, but in '80, a whole slew of liberal lions who'd been running for president just four years earlier, who'd been serving five, six terms, famous people at the time like Birch Bayh, Frank Church all upset by these upstart, insurgent Republicans.\n\nAnd so, you've got this rise of the new right. Newt Gingrich elected in '78 and then Reagan in '80 and it teaches people like Pelosi that liberalism is going to cost them elections, that if they let the country know how progressive they are, then there's going to be a backlash. And they learned that lesson over and over throughout the '80s as Reagan kept pounding them.\n\nThey still controlled the House of Representatives, even though they lost the Senate and the White House. And so, what they did is say, \"We've got the House, let's go to the banks. Let's go to corporate America and say look, we're not necessarily doing a lot for you, but we control the House. So, you'll pay up.\" And that was the way that they figured that they were going to be able to match Republicans.\n\nJS: When you say pay up, are you talking about campaign contributions?\n\nRG: Right, because prior to 1980, big money was not as much of a thing in politics, they had labor support. They had some corporate money and some wealthy donor money, but it wasn't anywhere near the scale that we have today. And so, they pivoted after 1980 to say - they diagnosed their 1980 problem as Republicans outspent us and outmaneuvered us. So, we need to match them dollar-for-dollar and to do that, we need to use our position in the House of Representatives and extract money from industry. That leads in an obvious direction. It reshaped the party and it ended up with the party of Bill Clinton and the party that we have today.\n\nBut as you watch Nancy Pelosi trying to navigate Trump, all she's thinking about is the Reagan era. If she says that she's for impeachment, if she says she's for Medicare for all, if she says she's for a Green New Deal, that the country is going to recoil at their progressivism and they're going to be thrown out.\n\nJS: Is it entirely that or is it that Pelosi believes in the policies that she's worked for her entire career? That she isn't as progressive as somebody who says \"Oh, I'm from San Francisco. I understand the left.\"\n\nRG: Right, I mean there is that because she was the right wing candidate in that primary so there absolutely is that. But at the same time, once you've been acting out a certain way for 30 or 40 years, the question of what you actually believe becomes impossible to disentangle. It almost doesn't matter. She's been doing this since then and whether, what exists in the recesses of her heart, is immaterial really.\n\nJS: So Pelosi gets elected in this special election that you're describing where her opponent was a Democratic Socialist of America and she barely wins that race. How does she then ascend within the party to any kind of a leadership position?\n\nRG: Well, she had the same abilities that her predecessor Phil Burton had, an incredible vote counter and a tremendous fundraiser. And so, because there was so much emphasis by '87 on fundraising, she just raised an extraordinary amount of money and would distribute it to colleagues. And because she was also tactically proficient within the caucus, she was able to carve out a place for herself. By 2001, Dick Gephardt is washing out of his career finally and she ends up replacing him around that time to become minority leader. And so, she's minority leader in 2002, 2004. When they finally take over in 2006, she's well positioned and nobody can challenge her by then.\n\nJS: And she becomes the first elected speaker of the House that was a woman.\n\nRG: Right.\n\nJS: So, as Pelosi and other Democrats are shifting the party in some ways toward big money, toward Wall Street and then Pelosi ends up in this position where she's minority leader and then ultimately becomes speaker of the House. When you talk about her ability to count votes - for the lay people among us, myself included - explain exactly what that means. Because you hear it now every day on cable that oh, Pelosi is this expert, she's great with the whip. She's good with the vote count. What does that mean just to ordinary folks?\n\nRG: And like I said her mentor had it too. And presumably her father, as well. But it means understanding exactly what the other person needs and is also afraid of. And so, it also means having a tactile feel for the district that somebody represents and understanding that a swing district in Iowa is not a swing district in Southern California, or it's not one in Central Pennsylvania. And just having that knowledge and that ability to listen to that other person and be transactional in what you can offer them, stick by those promises, deliver on them, and if somebody screws you to remember it.\n\nPeople will tell stories like there'll be 40 freshmen in a meeting and she'll go around the room and will point to each one of them and say, \"You screwed me on that motion to recommit last Tuesday. I don't ever want to see it happen again. You hit me on April 3rd with this in committee.\" She knows if you voted the wrong way in a committee hearing. And part of that is just this work ethic where she's putting in these absurd 16, 18-hour days which people have been talking about her and other people like her who just have this kind of maniacal drive.\n\nAnd so, you combine all those different things and you just don't want to cross her. I was actually talking to somebody just yesterday about a fight that she'd had with somebody else and his own boss said something like you don't want to get on the other end of the steely gaze of Pelosi. Like, she just has this like raw kind of power that she's holding in reserve.\n\nJS: She's extremely powerful.\n\nRG: Right.\n\nJS: I mean, she's one of the most powerful people in this country without question.\n\nRG: But then when you see her at a press conference, you're like how is this possible? She can't put a sentence together. You got a glimpse of it in her, in that one televised meeting with Trump where she kind of shut him down over the wall. It was six months ago or so. You kind of saw that like inside Pelosi coming out with the cameras on her. But that's basically what it means - a willingness to destroy somebody and an ability to reward somebody and knowing what the reward is that that person wants and kind of an amorality about the whole thing, not getting hung up on whether what you're doing is right or wrong.\n\nJS: Talk about Pelosi during the Bush/Cheney era because Pelosi was the subject of a lot of protest and anger from the left for a number of reasons. Whether it's the Patriot Act or the authorization for the use of military force or saying we're taking impeachment off the table when it came to Bush. What was her role and how did she function during the eight years of Bush/Cheney?\n\nJS: Right, so she's always been - she's carried the San Francisco flag in the sense of being broadly anti-war, voted against the Iraq War. But otherwise she was deeply hawkish in private meeting with Bush administration national security officials. When they described to her what waterboarding was like and what they're doing, she would say, \"Well, what else can you do?\" Not, wait, this appears criminal. What are you doing? But what more can you do? She was like a lot of Democrats both personally shaken by 9/11 and filled with this like \"we're going to get them\" sense of revenge, but also that the fear that they had that they were going to be rejected as too liberal was exacerbated after 9/11. They felt like oh God, now they're really going to think we're we're too liberal because not only are we tax and spenders but we're weak on defense too.\n\nBecause we've been at war now for so many years, I think people in our our generation and younger don't recognize how kind of traumatized that older generation is by the charge that they're weak on defense, that they're weak on the military. It would almost be nice if we could say that about Democrats today. It's no longer remotely true. But that was what Pelosi was was reacting to. That's why you had so many Democrats that voted for the Iraq War and people like her who supported the AUMF, who supported rendition and all these other war crimes that the Bush administration was participating in which then enabled the Obama administration to continue them.\n\nJS: Let's talk about the eight years of Bill Clinton and how that impacted the arc of the Democratic Party in terms of a historical analysis. What was the impact of Clintonism on the Democratic party?\n\nRG: Vanquishing the Rainbow Coalition in 1988, Jesse Jackson following Harold Washington before him organized this grassroots movement to say \"Look, you don't have, you don't need big money. You don't need to try to get back these Reagan Democrats. What you need to do is expand the electorate, go out and register new voters, confront this rise of the new right with a new left.\"\n\nJS: If you're listening and you have never watched the convention speeches of Jesse Jackson when he was running for president, it's an incredible moment in U.S. history and you really can see in the passion and the drenched in sweat. But what he was saying and the vision that Jesse Jackson had about multiculturalism and needing to grapple with race and sexual orientation, I mean, he was way ahead of the curve and he lost to the big establishment Democrats and that system churned out Bill Clinton and the response to Reagan and Bush ultimately was a pretty conservative Southern governor in Bill Clinton.\n\nRG: And what people don't realize because it's gone down the memory hole, was that Jackson very nearly won. And I write about this in the book -\n\nJS: The Democratic primary?\n\nRG: Yeah, very nearly won the Democratic primary and then he's running against George H.W. Bush which, who knows? It's hard to conceive of but who knows? It came very close and the Democratic party had a complete apoplectic meltdown when it appeared like he actually might seize the nomination.\n\nJS: You're talking about in '88?\n\nRG: '88. So, instead, they went with the electable Michael Dukakis. That then opens the way for these new Democrats, Bill Clinton. And Bill Clinton's famous Sister Souljah moment which this is summer of 1992 where he basically dredges up an obscure rapper. She hadn't ever been above I think 82 on Billboard.\n\nJS: She follows me on Twitter, Ryan, and has praised my Blackwater book.\n\nRG: [Laughs.] She's great now and she's an author and an interesting person. At the time, I think she was like 17.\n\nJS: Yeah, she was a young rapper and this was at the moment too when you had the rise of NWA and other so-called gangster rap that then the Joe Liebermans of the world, the Tipper Gores of the world talked about how this is what's really destroying white American society is these gangster rappers.\n\nRG: And so, Clinton famously calls her out, compares her to David Duke actually. And what's important is where he did it. This was at the Rainbow Coalition Conference with Jesse Jackson right there on stage. And so, I think that part has also been missed too that it was not just a signal to Reagan Democrats that he's like willing to take on these black people who were dominating the Democratic party. It was also a signal to Jesse Jackson and to the kind of, left in the Democratic party. \"This is my party now. I'm doing this at your conference.\" Jackson demanded an apology from him and he never got it. And that was his way of saying \"This is my party now.\" People also forget Clinton won with 43 percent of the vote because Ross Perot was in as a third party candidate. So, it's not like this new Democratic centrism was some resounding success.\n\nAnd that more than anything else has become a rallying cry for today's left, that says \"Look, if you actually won with this pragmatism, what you call pragmatism, then OK. Then we can have a conversation. If this centrism, if this compromising approach was actually keeping the fascists out of the gates, keeping the barbarians from raping and pillaging the village, then OK, that's a plausible argument to make but it's not. You got 43 percent with Bill Clinton. You lost to Bush. The one time you took a chance and nominated the unelectable person, Barack Obama, he wins twice. He then pivots to center and loses a thousand seats and we end up with Trump. So the pragmatism isn't very pragmatic. And so, the new generation which did not experience the trauma of losing to Newt Gingrich and Ronald Reagan doesn't have the fear of the Republican party that the Pelosi's of the world have.\n\nJS: Right, Clinton wins in the '92 election and then as you indicate in the midterms then there's this sweeping so-called Republican revolution that brings Newt Gingrich to the position of being speaker of the House and at the same time you had Bill Clinton and the Democrats adopting very right-wing policies on drugs, on crime you can, I think, argue on race, on all of these things and very hawkish militaristic policies.\n\nBut I want to zero in on the Crime Bill and the so-called war on drugs under Bill Clinton because it comes up quite often now because of Joe Biden being a sponsor of the Crime Bill. And then Kamala Harris, really bringing this up a lot and trying to reform her own image because people will say \"Oh, Kamala Harris is a cop.\" She's now trying to attack Biden from the left on the Crime Bill while pushing aside the concerns about her own role in the criminal justice system in this country. But for people that don't have a living memory of it or weren't around then, explain Clinton's Crime Bill, race policies, war on drugs.\n\nRG: Right, crime was an actual problem. It was a problem all across the country and partly or significantly because of the hollowing out of the manufacturing industry and the middle class and working classes that Reagan and the deregulating Democrats brought about in the '80s. So, you do have a bottoming out and you do have a surge in crime and so a response to that, also a response to the Civil Rights Movement, is just getting tougher and tougher and tougher. And there was no political lever to push in the other direction and so, in both primaries, Democratic and Republican, the candidate who could say that they were tougher on crime was the one who was going to win and so it just keeps getting ratcheted up and up and up. Bill Clinton famously calls for a hundred thousand new cops on the street and gets a standing ovation for that.\n\nAnd that's a cornerstone of the '94 Crime Bill. The idea is to just jack up sentences, mandatory minimums, three strikes and you're out. Lumping together a bunch of different things so, if you sell weed but you also own a gun, then that becomes a violent crime. The sentence is exponentially greater. So, you wind up then throughout the '90s with crime rates falling yet the prison population soaring. So, you're like wait a minute, how are there fewer crimes being committed but yet more and more and more people are in prison? And one of the answers that people are in prison for these extremely long sentences. And so, starting in the early 1980s, you just have practically a straight diagonal line up and you go from fewer than half a million prisoners to well over two million.\n\nJS: And then, on the issue of welfare reform, I mean, I'm originally from Wisconsin, at the time the Crime Bill was implemented, I was a student in Wisconsin and I remember Tommy Thompson was the governor at the time, a Republican and he had implemented sweeping so-called welfare reform that was essentially, when you boil it down to it, it was forcing people to choose between having a job where they can't make enough money to live or accepting state aid and then having to live your life essentially in a police state that is constantly monitoring every expense that you make. This whole notion that in order to get welfare, you have to work was a Tommy Thompson idea that then Bill Clinton more or less nationalized with his omnibus welfare reform package. That was, I mean, it was largely written by Republicans, but it was Bill Clinton who was championing it, shepherding it.\n\nRG: Yeah. And welfare got racialized. Reagan helped very much help do that. When people talk about Democrats going to the center, that's a euphemism for them distancing themselves from black people and from the Civil Rights era. That's essentially what they're talking about. And this was a huge part of that. This was Clinton's way of saying \"Look, that promise that I made on the Rainbow Coalition stage when I called out Sister Souljah, I'm delivering on that right now. I told you I would stick it to them.\" He was running for re-election and his advisors told him, you sign welfare reform and you're basically guaranteed to get re-election. Wendell Primus who was a top HHS official at the time resigned in protest over it. He's now one of Pelosi's top aides. And you had a couple others in the White House who resigned, who said this is going to increase poverty and increase child poverty. More or less, it has.\n\nAnd it has an illogic that says if you've received benefits for five years, that's it regardless of need. And like you said it puts all these draconian work requirements on it. Now welfare itself did need to be reformed because it had a gross kind of, police surveillance aspect to it to where you'd have government agents like raiding your house to try to find out if there was a man living in the house who might be benefiting from this $500 a month that you're getting. So, it was -\n\nJS: Oh, you still have that in Section 8 housing.\n\n[Crosstalk.]\n\nJS: I have friends who are housing lawyers and it's like they're still doing that. But yes -\n\n[Crosstalk.]\n\nRG: - Not to valorize or glamorize the original welfare program but it's better than what it was turned into.\n\nJS: I want to talk a bit before we get to the current situation of the Democratic party about Barack Obama's impact becoming the not just the president, but the leader for those eight years of the Democratic party. Obama launched his campaign and I think, he wanted to give the impression that he was the anti-war candidate, but in reality the speech that he gave in Chicago in October of 2002, which really launched his national political aspirations and campaign was a very carefully crafted speech with lots of ifs and thens in terms of the position. He famously said I'm not against all wars, I'm against dumb wars, stupid wars and essentially making a tactical argument against the Iraq War.\n\nAnd I often think of that as kind of a metaphor for how Obama governed. He would telegraph one thing and sort of, there would be this perception people would place onto the canvas of Obama, what they wanted to think he was but in reality, he always if you really took his words at their value, was saying I'm not a leftist and I actually am, would be a sort of, moderate Republican of the 90s. That was more or less how Obama, he wasn't lying or being disingenuous. He was telegraphing exactly who he was. The sense I had was that people wanted to place onto him an identity that Obama himself never even claimed but he did craft his identity - I mean political identity - in such a way that a lot of things were open to interpretation. It was like the sophisticated smart version of Trump saying we'll see what happens. Obama would allow people to think he was this thing but in reality, he was a pretty right-wing Democrat.\n\nRG: Right. And it very much helped him that he was running against Hillary Clinton too.\n\nJS: In that '08 primary, yeah.\n\nRG: In that '08 primary because she voted for the war without the caveats of it being a dumb war. And so, Obama was like you said, he was able to kind of fashion himself as an anti-war candidate even though in the district that he represented back in Chicago anyway, there was no other position for -\n\nJS: When he was in the state government.\n\nRG: For an official to have, that's an anti-war, rich liberal area like those. They're not supporting the invasion. But yeah, that's exactly right and so he runs against Hillary Clinton 2007, 2008 and against her, he does appear - You already want to believe, liberals wanted to believe that he was one of them. He must be. He's a great writer. He went to Harvard. He was a community organizer. I think that was a huge selling point to a lot of people. He must be a lefty. He's out there in the streets organizing.\n\nAnd so then, you just look at it through that prism, then you see him getting attacked by Mark Penn, Hillary Clinton's adviser, as un-American and it's easy to start defending him against all of these unfair attacks. And so, then you wind up with this massive, inspired grassroots army of millions of people ready to transform politics. And he could have brought that army with him into Washington with the sky falling, Wall Street completely collapsing, the economy on the brink. People were talking about the end of the Republican party like what's going to be the new party that takes its place? It was that low of a moment for them and they signaled right away before he was even sworn in that they were going to oppose him on everything across the board and that was going to be their play.\n\nAnd still, he shut down the grassroots army, basically folded up what was called OFA, Organizing for America, put it onto the DNC and mothballed the thing. And ordered all the outside groups under threat of them getting their donors called by Rahm Emanuel or Jim Messina to also stop pressuring Republicans and stop pressuring Blue Dogs because he's got this. He and Rahm are going to like work it out. They're gonna sit down with Susan Collins. They're going to figure this thing out. And if you push, it's only going to cause problems for the Blue Dogs in the midterms. So, just let us handle this. And of course, all those Blue Dogs lost anyway which goes back to the idea that the pragmatism isn't actually that pragmatic either.\n\nJS: Rahm Emanuel was much more vicious toward left Democrats than he ever was toward the Republicans.\n\nRG: It's the only time that that legendary ruthlessness is actually deployed in any effective way.\n\nJS: Oh, I remember early on - I don't remember if it was the first defense authorization bill but early on in Obama's time as president there was a movement among progressive Democrats to try to hold up defense spending and Rahm - I believe it was your reporting at the time - but Rahm Emanuel is the guy that goes over basically with the baton to start hitting the kneecaps of left wing, the handful of left-wingers that actually exist in the Democratic party.\n\nRG: Right, whenever there would be a peep from the progressive side, they'd either be called into the White House or Rahm would go down. I write about this in the book Rahm would go down to Capitol Hill and break some kneecaps. When the Blue Dogs -\n\nJS: These are the openly kind of right-wing Democrats?\n\nRG: Right wing, kind of the, yeah, the descendants of the Southern Dixiecrats. When they would complain, Rahm would come down to the Capitol say what do you need, boys? You know, what can I do for you?\n\nJS: Can I massage your knee?\n\nRG: Is your knee OK?\n\nJS: Wait a minute, is that Bernie Sanders? Baton! Oh, hello right-wing Democrat, can I just massage the knee a little bit?\n\nRG: And the results matter because they'd say \"Well, this stimulus is too big. We want 150 billion taken out of it.\" Boom, there goes like one and a half points worth of unemployment that you could have pulled off of the economy and Rahm's like get it done. Joe Lieberman doesn't like the way that the public option sounds. Rahm Emanuel's - get it done. Take it out, get it done. So, his toughness was exclusively reserved for the left. And anytime anybody on the right or the center had any problems, he easily would just meet them almost as if he was fine to do exactly what they were asking.\n\nJS: So, then in 2016, we had it boiling down to Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. And I don't want to spend too much time on 2016 for all sorts of reasons but in part, because we've also discussed it quite a bit on the show. But one part of 2016 I wanted to ask you about and that is when we talk about the documents, John Podesta's emails, DNC emails. I don't want to make this about WikiLeaks right now. What did those documents show that Hillary Clinton's campaign was doing toward Bernie Sanders and his campaign?\n\nRG: Not a lot, right? I mean they were, I mean, the Clinton campaign was infuriated by the Sanders campaign and felt that it was undignified that she was even having to deal with this socialist from Vermont.\n\nJS: Or anyone for that matter.\n\nRG: Or anyone.\n\nJS: This was a coronation. This was not a primary. This was meant to be a very long coronation and Sanders got in the way of that.\n\nRG: Right, then they started clearing the field as early as right after the 2012 election. All of the women in the Senate except for Warren signed a letter saying \"Run, Hillary, run and don't anybody else run against her.\" And Sanders didn't want to run like he was trying to get Warren to run. He was hoping somebody else would run just so that there could be some competing ideas put out in the primary. So, when nobody would and he eventually was like \"Ok, fine I'll do this. Somebody's got to make the argument.\" But he was very clear from the beginning, he was not trying to win out of the gate. That was sort of an accident, that Clinton was so unpopular, and his ideas were so popular that he almost got to her.\n\nProbably the most damaging thing that came out of there were the Goldman Sachs speeches, speech transcripts. And I didn't think it would seriously work but I had reached out to the campaign at some point in 2015, I think it was Karen Finney. I said, look, these speeches are going to come out at some point, leak them to me. I'll do the story right now and I'll light you guys up because I'm sure it's ridiculous whatever she said to Goldman Sachs. It's gonna come out like get it out, get it out now and give it to me. And she's like ha, no, we're not going to release these to anybody ever.\n\nIn hindsight, they should have taken my helpful advice at that time and put them out in 2015 because then when they finally did come out because WikiLeaks forced them out. Now it's close to the election and you have the fact of the private speeches married with the years-long effort to keep them private which just imbues them with suspicion which is warranted. And then she comes out and says, I think in a debate, \"Look, you say some things privately and you say different things publicly. That's how this works.\" Like oh, I can't believe you just said that. Well yeah, we were aware that that's how you operate. But it's amazing to hear you say it out loud.\n\nAnd so, it just, it really, she already had the impression that she'd say whatever she wanted to get elected. There was already the impression that she was too close to Wall Street and to wealthy interests. And then that just underlined it for everybody. It was something that you could just understand in one sentence. $700,000, speaking to Goldman Sachs.\n\nJS: Coming out of the 2016 election - I mean, this may be an oversimplification. You can put whatever nuance you want in this but it does seem like there is a very clear split in the Democratic Party right now where on the one hand, you have the Hillary Clinton wing of the Democratic Party and then on the other hand, you have I mean, you could say the Bernie Sanders wing but really it's more of a left front that is, sort of, arguing against the Pelosi/Clinton/Obama worldview and trying to do things differently. You have what is it now? Twenty-four people running for the Democratic nomination? Give a kind of overview in the context of the 2020 election of where the Democratic party is today and what are the dynamics within it?\n\nRG: Right, it's sort of the wing that was represented by Jesse Jackson and then was vanquished throughout much of the 90s and it kind of rises again sort of accidentally through Howard Dean. Howard Dean was not that progressive of a candidate but again, he kind of appeared like it next to everybody else. He was the only candidate who was running on opposition to the Iraq War and because he was from Vermont, people felt like \"Oh well, he must be pretty liberal.\" And he's a doctor who talked about universal health care. So, it was check, check, check for a lot of progressives. And so, the blogosphere was just getting going then. Move On was just getting the ability to raise big amounts of money online.\n\nAnd so, all of a sudden he has a well-funded and organized campaign which falls apart at the very end. Everybody talks about his scream. But actually, if you remember this the thing that undid him was he said something like he didn't want Saddam Hussein executed. I think there was some comment around Saddam Hussein and the entire Democratic primary electorate was like oh, he's going to get beat by Bush. Bush is too tough. We're gonna be too weak and they went into their shells and they're like \"Let's do John Kerry.\" They can't question his military credentials. But all of the learning and organizing that had gone on around the Dean campaign then fueled other campaigns in 2006 and then also the Obama campaign and it flows into Occupy.\n\nJS: Just one note before you go on with that, one just bookend on Howard Dean. He then goes on to be head of the Democratic National Committee and has just steadily moved himself even further and further and further to the right. He's taken money from the MEK group that's agitating for regime change in Iran and had been for many years an officially designated terror organization by the State Department. And Howard Dean helped lobby against that and he's now just basically a right-wing Democrat attack dog going after anyone on the left of the Democratic party.\n\nRG: He's a gun for hire.\n\nJS: Yeah, he's a gun for hire. He's a Lanny Davis that has managed to get elected to office before but yeah, I mean, he's in that camp of people.\n\nRG: Right, but the people that tried to get him elected those were actual lefties.\n\nJS: Oh, for sure. I mean, I remember covering him in New Hampshire and elsewhere and it was the same thing you saw with Obama that people were projecting onto Howard Dean everything that they want in a candidate and it's like the evidence isn't really there. I mean Howard Dean had promoted the idea that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. When I asked him about that at an event in New Hampshire, he said well I said that because somebody in the Clinton team had told me that. Oh well, that really gives you confidence that this is a guy who's gonna be sifting and winnowing through the intelligence. But in any case, so then we get to 2016. Trump wins the Electoral College defeating Hillary Clinton and you were about to talk more about the big picture of the Democratic Party as it exists today.\n\nRG: Yeah, and what Dean and then to a degree Obama and then Bernie Sanders did is that they created an alternative kind of funding structure. Obama did both. He had a huge small dollar operation and also tons of money from Wall Street and other places. But Obama showed that you could raise an extraordinary amount of money online for a presidential campaign, which was the kind of the promise of the Dean campaign back in '03. And then Bernie Sanders kind of actualized that and then you see what's happened in 2020 with the DNC even leaning into it saying everybody needs to have 65,000 small donors to get on the stage.\n\nWhen we were kids, every quarter, the candidates would brag about how much money they had raised, who their bundlers were, the names of the lobbyists that were bundling money for them and that was a mark of seriousness. That doesn't happen anymore. They hide that. They don't publicize who their bundlers are -\n\nJS: Well, Joe Biden is kind of shamelessly sailing toward big money.\n\nRG: Right, yes because he can't raise small money and the knock on him had been that he was so lazy that he was doing all this pro-corporate work for free basically and that he wasn't going to be able to raise big money and so he has internalized that. So, he's like \"No, look I really can. These companies will, they will pay. These rich people do like me.\"\n\nJS: It's kind of like political viagra. It's like \"Oh OK, I'll just go and take the big money.\"\n\nRG: Otherwise, the candidates just say, my average donation was this small. I have this many small donors to show that they have this broad base of support and what that's done is it's set up an alternative kind of, funding structure for the rival wing of the party.\n\nJesse Jackson didn't really have that. There wasn't an efficient way for people to say, \"Wow, Jesse Jackson. We're almost 40 primaries in and he's neck and neck for the nomination. I want to give him $30.\" There was mail, but there wasn't really a way for people to express their support for people in the way there is now where you can just tap your phone every time Bernie Sanders gets attacked and you want to fight back. Alright here, take another of my five dollars. And so, that has really changed the calculation and since it was a weird accident that they started taking big money in the first place, it means it's not part of the DNA, like the party is not built only to take big money. The party could be taken over by small donors.\n\nJS: How do you - I would leave it to you to decide which ones we talk about right now because you're in the weeds on this stuff and cover it all the time. But I do want to get some thoughts about a variety of candidates from you. Do you want to start with -\n\nRG: Sure.\n\nJS: Who do you wanna start with?\n\nRG: Doesn't matter.\n\nJS: All right, Elizabeth Warren.\n\nRG: I mean, Elizabeth Warren, people left her for dead. And they ridiculed her for -\n\nJS: Because of her DNA test.\n\nRG: - The DNA stuff and the campaign's idea was, \"This is going to suck. We're going to do it now, December, October.\" October, they did it so that by the middle of 2019, we can focus more on her campaign and get this Pocahontas thing behind us. And they have doubled in the polls. She's - The idea of like putting out ideas seems to be working. And it's not necessarily chipping away at Bernie's support. You're seeing Bernie rise as well. If every gain that Warren made was at the expense of Bernie, then it'd be kind of like a zero-sum game for the left and that meant they were just gonna get wiped out eventually. But they both are rising.\n\nJS: Why is it that when you turn on almost any news program now that are talking about this, they're just talking about how Biden is pulling away. Like what's going on? They're like Biden's pulling ahead. Constantly on CNN, I hear Biden's pulling ahead. Biden's widening this lead.\n\nJS: It comes from this basic mental error that people were making that was OK, yes Biden's polling at 35 percent right now. But when he gets in, he's going to collapse. And so, he got in and then three days later he hadn't collapsed. And so everybody's like oh, we must have been wrong. We were sure he was going to collapse. He didn't collapse in three days. So, therefore, he's going to surge and pull away with it. But like the idea that that 35 percent, most of whom are barely paying attention to the election, were going to change their mind within a week of him officially announcing, of that 35 percent, what percent do you think even know that he transitioned from saying he was thinking about running to actually running? Probably not a ton of them. People are not following it close enough.\n\nJS: But what I'm getting at though is that you see this and you see it from a lot of like Hillary camp people online that Biden is just crushing it in the polls. And I'm asking you like what is that all about?\n\nRG: Well, it worked for Hillary. The argument for Hillary was inevitability and electability. And so, you should support her because she's going to win. And it's circular. And so, you have to keep saying it. It's like a balloon that you just have to keep blowing air into otherwise it just sinks. So, that's really what it is. Because Biden doesn't have anything else that he's selling to the Democratic primary electorate other than that \"I'm going to win this and then I'm going to beat Trump and I'll beat him up behind the gym.\"\n\nJS: Is the conduct of Joe Biden during the Anita Hill confirmation going to continue to be a problem for him?\n\nRG: Yeah, it is a problem for him. A lot of people remember how badly he handled that and his inability to actually apologize for it means that it'll just keep coming up. The way that Hillary Clinton you remember was dogged for months being asked to apologize for her vote for the Iraq War and she just wouldn't do it. If she would just do it then, you can at least move on. Might not help with a lot of people but at least it ends that conversation. But Biden has said he's never made a mistake in his life. He said I don't regret anything I've ever done is what he says. And so, he goes around defending the Crime Bill. He's not somebody who's like I was wrong. The party was wrong at the time. I was doing what I thought was right. I've seen the light and this is how we should be doing this now. He says I've always been progressive. I've always done the right thing and that forces him to defend things that nobody thinks are the right thing anymore.\n\nJS: What about Kamala Harris?\n\nRG: So, I think she benefits from I don't know if it's racism or just ignorance on the part of a lot of the press that say Kamala Harris is black, therefore black people will vote for her. It's kind of a gross oversimplification. And so, she's actually gonna end up suffering from that in this sense. Like as it becomes clear that that's not the case, the press is going to say wait a minute, we thought that all black people would support her because she's black and that's not happening so there must be something wrong with her candidacy. Well no, that wasn't, that shouldn't be the expectation to begin with.\n\nThe thing that she's also lacking is kind of a why. Like why is she running for president? What's her vision for the country? Because she doesn't have the obvious - and this is racist also - she doesn't have the \"I'm electable and I can beat Trump.\" Because in this country electable and I can beat Trump means I'm a white guy. So, she doesn't have that. And she also doesn't have a Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders style, this is my vision for how the country should be governed and transformed. So, you're left with a well, what? What what's going on here?\n\nAnd so, when you're talked about as a top tier candidate but you continue to hover under 10 percent that chips away at your sheen of kind of, inevitability or electability. She certainly, she gets talked about all the time as vice president for if it's Joe Biden or something like that. And she has, I'm sure, a big career ahead of her. But what exactly the path is, remains unclear. You'd have to have Biden collapse and her to kind of take over the Biden lane for the Hillary Clinton type aides.\n\nJS: I mean, all politics is performance at some level but I do think that both Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris are remarkably good lawmakers when it comes to interrogating hostile witnesses. And obviously, Kamala Harris spent a lot of time in law enforcement and as a prosecutor and I personally think it would be utterly fascinating to watch Kamala Harris debate Donald Trump and to see how she would meticulously prepare for that. It's like in many movies, the prosecutors are the good guys -\n\nRG: It would be interesting if she would say, \"there are a lot of people out there that need to be prosecuted. And I have the skills to prosecute those people. We have been letting elites get away with criminal behavior for far too long\" and try to use it that way. But she does the same thing with Biden where she says she was a progressive prosecutor which isn't true. She ran against progressive prosecutors. She was stridently a tough on crime prosecutor. And so rather than kind of owning up to that and saying I was wrong. Times have changed because I don't believe she does believe she's wrong which is, that's totally her right. But that's why she can't get to that place.\n\nJS: Why is Beto O'Rourke still in the race? I mean, you write about the incredible success of his failed bid for Senate. But it was an impressive campaign and he came close to pulling off something that that I think almost no one thought could happen prior to that race. But why is he still hanging around? It doesn't seem like there's this huge Beto wave nationally.\n\nRG: Well, he enjoys it.\n\nJS: Oh, good. That's why we run for president now?\n\nRG: When he said - Yeah, got nothing else to do.\n\nJS: I mean, his position that he staked out at that CNN town hall on health care. It's like, I think a lot of people were just like he doesn't even have that. You know, why are we here? Why do we have to listen to Beto O'Rourke's ideas about America?\n\nRG: Yeah and when he famously said in that Vanity Fair article that he was born to be in this. He didn't mean born to be president. What he meant is he just loves campaigning. He loves going around and talking to people. He did it for two years in Texas and he was bored immediately afterwards and he hit the road again.\n\nJS: It's like he's forcing us all to go and report on his Phish tour. He's just, he's jamming' with the didgeridoo with the band and, \"Oh yeah, and by the way, I'm also running for president.\"\n\nRG: But yeah, so he - The problem is he, I think he believed that he had a much better chance of winning than he did. And as a result of that he discarded the tactics that he had used in his Senate campaign, discarded the actual Bernie people who had organized his Texas Senate campaign and replaced them with Obama people. The very ones who had actively shut down OFA like the officials who were overseeing that project of shutting down his grassroots army. They shut down Beto's grassroots army believing that Biden wasn't really serious and that the kind of Obama world of establishment figures would wind up getting behind Beto and he'd be lifted to victory because nobody else was a kind of, they could conceivably see as winning the nomination.\n\nAnd so he stopped fighting for it. And like you said, he drifted away from Medicare for all. He abandoned his kind of organizing approach that he'd been taking. And it turned out that he was not in the position that he thought he was in. And so, now he's down to, way down closer to zero.\n\nJS: What about the Hawaii congressperson Tulsi Gabbard, who's a Iraq War veteran, has come under fire for previous positions on everything ranging from gay rights to expressing support for extremist Hindu politicians and institutions to more recently, the fact that she went to Syria and met with Bashar al Assad and has been very, very opposed to any U.S. military action aimed at unseating Assad. And our colleague Glenn Greenwald recently did a long sit down interview with her where he brought up some of these critiques but the way that she is handled when she goes on major TV networks primarily on CNN, it's extremely hostile and the way that she's interviewed seems intent on defending the good name of imperial America. And that's how it's presented. But what's going on with that campaign?\n\nRG: She's badly undermined by Sanders' presence in the campaign. She rose to national prominence at the end of the campaign by quitting the DNC and endorsing Bernie which, might not be proper to point out, happened long after the campaign was over. If you date the kind of, end of the Sanders campaign in April or May or so, it's nice that Tulsi went public with her dissatisfaction with how the DNC handled that and endorsed Bernie, but it didn't do him any good at that point. It did her an enormous amount of good and all of the Sanders goodwill kind of drifted over to her. If he hadn't run, she'd have a core of supporters that would be out organizing for her. But her reason to be in is less clear with him in because they agree on - I mean, she certainly makes a bigger deal out of anti-imperialism than he does but they agree on that issue. So, at that point like well, what are you bringing to the campaign that Sanders isn't since Sanders is kind of the one that brought you to the campaign in the first place?\n\nJS: Well, I mean she would probably say that she was a combat veteran, that she's a woman, that she represents a much younger generation in politics.\n\nRG: She has far more right to run - well, everyone has a right to run - she has just far more reason to run than at least a dozen of these dudes for the reasons that you mentioned but her lane was always going to be on the progressive side and with Bernie and Warren taking it all up, it's just really hard to see.\n\nJS: What about what's going on now with the Bernie Sanders campaign? It's not a case at this point certainly, that he's just running away with it and that there is any inevitability to it in part because of Biden being in the race. But I see it more as you have Sanders and Warren and then a handful of other people that are sort of to the left of the Pelosi Democratic Party and then, you have the massive Clinton/Pelosi machine that will produce somebody and that they believe that that person is going to have the nomination and we don't know who that is at this point. It looks like Biden is the anointed one but who knows what happens but what's going on with Bernie Sanders given that there's a field of 24 people? There is Elizabeth Warren. There is Tulsi Gabbard. Is it operating the way it did in 2016? Is he running a successful fundraising operation? Is he going up in the polls?\n\nRG: I think he's running a much better campaign in 2020 just functionally, operationally than he was in 2016. It's a much more professional campaign and it's much more bottom-up, organizer-driven whereas in 2016, for all of its revolutionary talk, it was fairly traditional in the sense that they were raising money - now, not the traditional way - but they were raising money to fund a field program and go up on TV in early states. Like that was, now, their message was different but the strategy was the same. Right now, they're running a very distributed campaign where they're trying to empower their organizers all over the country to organize in places where they don't have paid field staff. They're raising money at an even faster clip than they did in 2016.\n\nHe is ticking up in the polls but the psyche of the Democratic primary voter plays into this in a disturbing way in the sense that they just can't, a lot of voters can't convince themselves that a Democratic socialist is \"electable.\" And so, his 40 plus percent that he got in 2016 relied on some protest vote against Clinton. He was the alternative. O'Malley was just not doing it as the alternative. And some protests against the system and some who were voting for him because they thought he could win and would be president. But by no means was that 100 percent of his base and so the ones that weren't in that base are now out shopping around for other candidates.\n\nIf he can pull off a win in Iowa - that's the thing about being unelectable. If you show yourself to be electable, it changes everything. Barack Obama's numbers among black voters before Iowa were in the single digits because they quite reasonably said this country's not going to elect Barack Obama so I'm not going to waste my vote on somebody that they're not going to elect. When Obama won Iowa, overnight in the black community, his numbers went from single digits to well into the majority and within weeks, he'd sewed up the black vote. When it became clear actually, these corn-fed kids out in Iowa voted for this guy, he could actually win.\n\nSo, if Sanders can win in Iowa and then can win in New Hampshire, the aura of winning can create the impression of electability and the aura of losing - let's say Biden loses those - it damages the impression of his own electability and so, that really is the only way that I see something like that turning around. Maybe you have a Warren and Ocasio-Cortez getting in behind him at a key moment around that time and creating kind of, a new sense of inevitability around a Sanders presidency. But it's really threading a needle but he would have to do something about that impression that he can't win.\n\nJS: But the open hostility toward Bernie Sanders that continues or even is increasing in some quarters of the Democratic party is real. I mean, there is this just fierce hatred for Bernie Sanders in certain sectors of the Democratic party. If Sanders does win the Democratic nomination, what happens to all those extremely angry people who seem to think that Sanders is worse than Donald Trump in some ways? What happens then in the Democratic party?\n\nRG: Right, does somebody like Howard Schultz run just to spoil it for Democrats at that point and get five percent and throw it to Trump? That's the risk with that. And that's the threat like, that's kind of the point.\n\nJS: I don't think Howard Schultz's own staff would vote for him. I mean, I'm talking about like are these people even going to vote for Bernie Sanders? Are they going to write in Hillary Clinton?\n\nRG: Well, the good news for Democrats or for Bernie supporters would be that they almost all live in Washington or New York. And so, they don't live in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. Those are the key states that are going to swing the presidential election. And so, whatever Nicole Wallace wants to do, she can do. But the question of can Bernie win those three key states is what decides whether or not he can beat Trump. And if you talk to Republicans, interestingly, Republicans who know those states well, they believe that Bernie is a major threat in a state like, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin because not only does he galvanize the Democratic base support, but he does appeal to the kind of angry independents who just want to cast a screw you vote. They can just as happily cast it for Bernie Sanders as they can for Trump. And so, Republicans ironically, are more convinced of Sanders' electability in those states than Democrats are.\n\nJS: Ryan Grim, congrats again on the book and thanks for being with us.\n\nRG: Always a pleasure.\n\nJS: Ryan Grim is The Intercept's Washington DC bureau chief.

      "text": "How Black Voters Lifted Doug Jones Over Roy Moore\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nBlack activists in Alabama expected increased turnout in the Senate special election. And they got it.\n\nDothan, Alabama - The day after Doug Jones won the Democratic nomination for Senate, Dr. Joe Reed sat down to share his thoughts on the race with The Intercept. Reed, head of the Alabama Democratic Conference, is largely seen as the de facto leader of the Alabama Democratic Party, as most of the state executive committee is either an ally or member of the ADC.\n\nHe is, in many ways, the last true black party boss in the South. But the way Reed sees it, if a Democrat like Jones wants to win the Alabama Senate seat, he can't rely on black votes, he has to do his own work in the white areas.\n\n\"He's gonna have to campaign in white folks' districts himself,\" Reed said. As if on cue, his flip phone rang.\n\nIt was Doug Jones, calling to pay his respects.\n\n\"Now whatcha gotta do now,\" he lectured Jones, \"is get out on the road and tell Bubba and Cooter how important the Democratic Party is for them.\"\n\nHe rattled off the names of long-dead Democratic congresspeople and their accomplishments. \"If he's from around Huntsville, he oughta thank John Sparkman every day. If he got a student loan, he oughta thank Carl Elliott,\" Reed said. \"So go tell 'em what the Democratic Party has meant to them and meant to their parents.\"\n\nWhile Reed was comfortable delegating the white vote to Jones, he didn't leave anything to chance on his end. Reed's job was eased by Roy Moore, the Republican nominee, who toward the end of the campaign waxed poetically about the halcyon days of slavery, comments that got little attention at the time but began going viral last week. Asked by an African-American voter when he thought America was last \"great,\" he reached for the years before the Civil War. \"I think it was great at the time when families were united - even though we had slavery - they cared for one another,\" he said. \"Our families were strong, our country had a direction.\"\n\nPrecisely whose families were strong, and which were sold in pieces, was left unsaid, but it resonated nonetheless. Black activists in Alabama expected increased turnout in the Senate special election, in part due to those remarks. And they got it: Late Tuesday night, the Associated Press called the race for Jones, who won largely on the strength of black turnout.\n\n\"Roy Moore said the only time America was great was back when slavery existed, and we don't want nothing to do with that dude,\" said the Rev. Kenneth Glasgow, an activist in Dothan. \"That dude trying to make us slaves.\"\n\nGlasgow led a county-wide canvassing effort here in Houston County for Reed's Alabama Democratic Conference, the largest Democratic and black organization in Alabama. Old school tactics are being deployed to try to repair the turnout machine that was broken by the Republican waves of the early 2000s.\n\nTuesday afternoon, Glasgow and his friend Edward Jones set up grills outside polling stations. Buses, minivans, and taxicabs started taking people to the polls. In rural Escambia County, likewise, a Monday night fish fry served as an informal local gathering and a get-out-the-vote rally.\n\nThe effort was possible this election as opposed to previous ones, Reed said, because Jones's campaign made the decision to fund the ADC's get-out-the-vote efforts. Neglect a party base, and turnout falls off. Invest in it, and people will turn out. It may seem obvious, but the Alabama Democratic candidates hadn't done much of it in recent cycles.\n\nUnder the leadership of Reed and party chair Nancy Worley, the ADC and the Alabama Democratic Party have largely focused their efforts on preserving their seats in the cities and the Black Belt around Montgomery, much to the chagrin of some rank-and-file (mostly white) Democrats, like Rep. Craig Ford, D-Gadsden, who complains that Reed \"killed\" the party.\n\nReed, on Election Day, was unapologetic. \"I can't get white folks to vote Democrat. White folk gots to do that,\" he said, exasperated. \"It's much easier for whites to go out and embrace white Republicans; they go to church together, they go to school together, they go to sororities and fraternities together, they do all that stuff together. So it's much easier than to pick up the flag and say I'm gonna be a Democrat.\"\n\nThe ADC said that it was hoping for 50 percent turnout among the black community in Alabama; an improbable number but a sign of confidence from an organization that has seen setbacks in recent years. With the exception of President Barack Obama's campaigns in 2008 and 2012, the black vote has seen a steep decline in Alabama since the early 2000s.\n\nIt is an unavoidable reality that black enthusiasm has waned, says Dr. Earl Jones, the head of ADC's efforts in southeastern Alabama, and Glasgow's mentor.\n\n\"I consider it to be a function of learned helplessness on the part of black and poor people, particularly in Alabama and in rural areas,\" Jones explains. \"Their sons and daughters are being arrested. Look at the city jails, the county jails, the state jails, you see they're filled with people of color. ... And that learned helplessness evolved out of that. In other words, they said it's not going to make any difference anyway regardless to how I vote. And they've seen that in various ways, I would say.\"\n\nMoore seems to have been just enough to begin to reverse that.\n\nCNN EXIT POLL: Today's electorate in Alabama was 65% white, 30% black, 2% Latino. There aren't exit polls from 2016 but the 2012 presidential electorate was 68% white, 28% black, 2% Latino. Usually off-year elections and special elections have less diverse electorates, not more.\n\n- Marshall Cohen (@MarshallCohen) December 12, 2017\n\nAfter the election results came in, Earl Jones called black turnout performance \"phenomenal.\" Michael Jones, ADC's chair of the black belt county of Crenshaw, said that he had \"called it\" within a few thousand votes.\n\nThe Democratic nominee, Doug Jones, needed black voters to come out in higher numbers than they have in the past. Bob Vance nearly beat Judge Roy Moore in 2012 when he last ran for chief justice of the state's Supreme Court, but even then it was only with the massive turnout inspired by Obama's re-election campaign.\n\nNationally, of course, the conversation centered on Moore's penchant for molesting children as a prosecutor in his 30s. An exit poll found that 54 percent of voters said the allegations did not influence their vote, but, presumably, that number included many voters who had long ago made up their mind they would not vote for Moore, who has been twice removed from the bench.\n\nBut those who dismissed the allegations relied on a few mental exercises. Some blamed the \"fake news media\" for concocting them from whole cloth, while others claimed the women had been paid by George Soros to make the charges.\n\nIt is harder, though, to explain away Moore's own words. When asked by Sean Hannity if he ever remembered dating teenagers as a thirtysomething when he was deputy district attorney, he said, \"I don't remember ever dating any girl without the permission of her mother.\"\n\nWhen asked how he met his wife, he described seeing her perform at a ballet recital as a young girl. With no children of his own with him, Moore stood at the back of the auditorium and watched the girls dance, he said.\n\n\"When I was deputy district attorney, many years before we got married, I saw her at a dance recital. I was standing in the back of the auditorium and I saw her up front, and I remembered her name, Kayla Kaiser - K.K. - I remembered that. I didn't meet her, I left, and it was, gosh, eight years later, I met her.\"\n\nMoore told her he thought he knew her. \"She thought I was coming on and making it up, then I told her, and she identified the dance,\" he said.\n\nWhen they eventually married, she was 24.\n\nAt Moore's campaign event Tuesday night, the crowd was raucous as the results began to trickle in, showing the judge ahead in early voting. Someone in the crowd had to call for quiet as Janet Porter, the head of the Faith2Action, tried to lead the room in prayer. \"I thank God for Roy Moore,\" Porter intoned, \"who is the closest to a Founding Father I've ever seen.\"\n\nBut after the AP and the New York Times called the race, a visibly distraught Rich Hobson, Moore's campaign chief of staff, came on stage, declaring that the Moore campaign wasn't giving up yet. \"I wanna ask y'all to pray,\" Hobson implored the stunned audience.\n\nTop photo: Democratic senatorial candidate Doug Jones greets supporters after voting at Brookwood Baptist Church on Dec. 12, 2017, in Mountain Brook, Ala.\n\nWAIT!

It's an effective strategy used by city elites to artificially inflate conservative political power.\n\nA recent annexation vote in Mobile, Alabama, will shrink the white-black voter gap by thousands. (Win McNamee / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nLast week's annexation vote in Mobile, Alabama, was pitched as a race to be among the biggest cities in the Southern state. The Gulf Coast city added more than fifteen thousand residents , hoisting Mobile above Montgomery and Birmingham, and just below Huntsville.\n\n\"God answers prayers! We're the second-largest city in Alabama!\" proclaimed Mobile mayor Sandy Stimpson.\n\nWhat annexation supporters were more reluctant to talk about was the racial disparity. Only 27 percent of the city's new residents are black, shrinking the white-black voter gap by thousands in a majority-minority city with a history of institutional racism.\n\nThe annexation was less God's plan than a years-long effort to \"Make Mobile Great Again\" by the city's elite Republican power players. The campaigners were led by Stimpson, a wealthy lumber scion who once served as Jeff Sessions's finance chairman.\n\nSince the era of the civil rights movement, annexing white suburbs has been a tool for Southern and Sunbelt cities seeking to dilute the black vote.\n\nIn 1970, Richmond, Virginia, annexed twenty-three square miles and fifty thousand people, primarily white. That instantly changed Virginia's capital from a majority-black to a majority-white city. The Supreme Court later ruled that the annexation had been made for racial reasons and placed an injunction on Richmond's municipal elections for seven years.\n\nThe following year, Atlanta mayor Sam Massell tried and failed to do much the same thing in Georgia's capital city. The Justice Department blocked a Houston, Texas, annexation in 1979 that would have added one hundred forty thousand mostly white people to the city's population, diluting the voting power of blacks and Latinos. In North Carolina, Charlotte's boundaries have swollen to the physical size of New York City due to constant annexation over the last several decades.\n\nThe July 18 vote was actually plan B for Mobile's annexation plan.\n\nIn 2019, Stimpson tried to fast-track a \"Grow Mobile\" plan to annex land from unincorporated areas in suburban West Mobile County, where approximately 70 percent residents are white and where voters chose Stimpson over his two black opponents by a nine-to-one ratio.\n\nThe city council voted 4-3 along racial lines in favor of that first annexation plan. Still, a five-vote supermajority was required as part of the Zoghby Act, reconfiguring Mobile's government in 1985 following a civil lawsuit. The US Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division had previously found that Mobile's city commission form of government was discriminatory, with \"smoking gun\" evidence in the form of a 1909 letter written by a white state senator, which explicitly said the post-Reconstruction government was set up because \"we were trying to exclude not the ignorant vote, but the Negro vote.\" Little wonder that no black people had been elected in Mobile's city government from Reconstruction until after the Zoghby Act.\n\nAfter the initial defeat of the 2019 annexation plan, Mobile County sheriff Sam Cochran held a press conference announcing a petition effort to strip the supermajority rule from the city council. The council's three black members condemned the petition as a \"full-out assault on our citizens,\" and it eventually failed.\n\nAs Stimpson pressed for another annexation vote in 2021, Mobile politics turned darkly surreal.\n\nFirst, city council president Levon Manzie, who was black, died a few weeks before the municipal election in November 2021. Almost immediately after Manzie's passing, dark money from a conservative PAC chaired by a man with political ties to Tommy Tuberville, Jeff Sessions, and the Alabama Republican Party flowed into the dead councilman's campaign coffers.\n\nMeanwhile, Stimpson appointed Manzie's mother, Jeanette, to serve on the city council for a month in her deceased son's seat. Two black pastors in Mobile said they believed Jeanette was being used as a pawn to vote for annexation before the election. After Jeanette withdrew a day later, a mysterious campaign started to elect the recently deceased Manzie, with mailers claiming that people should vote for him to honor him.\n\nFormer Mobile mayor Sam Jones, the city's first black mayor, wasn't convinced. \"The attempt was apparently to buy who you wanted into that seat to influence [policy],\" Jones said at the time. But the wild scheme to elect a dead man in order to handpick a candidate favorable to annexation failed after William Carroll, another black candidate, won by just four hundred votes.\n\nCarroll's win and the threats of lawsuits put Stimpson's annexation plan on ice. Shortly after the election, the Southern Poverty Law Center sent the City of Mobile a letter warning they'd sue the city if they found evidence of a \"racial gerrymandering technique\" of \"packing\" and \"cracking\" in the city's redistricting plan, or an annexation plan that \"would serve to dilute the political power of communities of color.\"\n\nMobile's black voters won a victory in August of 2022 when the council voted for a redistricting plan that included majority black council representation for the first time in city history. But thanks to Stimpson, annexation continued to hang over the city like the sword of Damocles.\n\nStimpson's latest annexation plan was finally successful in last Tuesday's special election, with three of four areas voting to enter the City of Mobile. The new voting age demographics have narrowed from 49.7 percent black and 44.4 percent white to 47.5 percent black and 46.1 percent white.\n\nShalela Dowdy, a Mobile native , had won a recent victory as a plaintiff in Allen v. Milligan , in which the Supreme Court ruled in June that the state of Alabama had violated the 1965 Voting Rights Act with a racially gerrymandered congressional district map. But Dowdy sees Mobile's annexation as a setback. \"Throughout the years, there have been obstacles and voter suppression tactics put in our way to prevent us from voting,\" she said . \"Voter suppression continues, but in disguise through the rose-colored glasses of annexation.\"\n\nRyan Zickgraf is a journalist based in Atlanta.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nThis year's GOP congressional candidates are more racially diverse than ever, and the party is making worrisome inroads among voters of color. Democrats have never understood that without a substantive appeal to voters of color, those voters may leave them.\n\nAnna Paulina Luna appears on a panel discussion during a taping of \"Candace\" hosted by Candace Owens on January 4, 2022 in Nashville, Tennessee. (Brett Carlsen / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe GOP, which since the 1970s has relied on white voters to win elections, is currently running the largest number of non-white candidates for Congress. Mainstream outlets like the New York Times and Washington Post have noted that, since at least some of these candidates are likely to win their races, they will create the most diverse GOP congressional delegation since Reconstruction.\n\nThese candidates come from racial and ethnic groups not typically associated with the GOP. For example, there's Anna Paulina Luna in Florida's 13th Congressional District, which encompasses St Petersburg and the surrounding area. Luna is a Latina and a conservative, critical of what she calls \"illegal immigration\" (though her comments are considerably less virulently racist than some of her Republican counterparts, including Lauren Boebert, who recently endorsed her). Wesley Hunt, a black man running in Texas's 38th Congressional District in the Houston metro area, favors what he calls \"border security\" and supports \"our men and women in blue,\" who must be defended against \"radical liberals in Congress.\"\n\nOf the 435 Republicans running for the House of Representatives, sixty-seven are people of color. This number doesn't reflect the racial demographics of the United States. But it does represent a significant effort on the part of the GOP to diversify their candidates and their party.\n\nOur legislative bodies should, of course, be more diverse. It isn't just morally correct; more elected officials of color can make our governments better at advancing progressive priorities. But Democrats too often treat racial, gender, sexual, and other representation as if it were a final victory. Which, for many of them, it is: the party has sought diverse faces in high places to carry out an agenda that leaves the miserably unequal status quo untouched.\n\nVoters of color aren't stupid. They've realized this approach is hollow at best, a multiracial cover for political misdeeds at worst - which has helped lead to a situation in which the GOP, pursuing an agenda that is dangerous to the working class, immigrants, queer and transgender people, black people, the environment, and much more, doesn't seem like such a bad gamble.\n\nThe GOP's goal in nominating a more diverse set of candidates is to challenge a key Democratic strategy in the US electorate. Winning an overwhelming majority of the black vote has been crucial to Democratic electoral victories for several decades, particularly in cities and metropolitan areas where black people and people of color in general disproportionately live in the United States. Even in regions where these groups are minorities, carrying 80 to 95 percent of the black vote can catapult a Democrat to victory. When this turnout is less than expected or hoped, Democratic victories become chancier or impossible.\n\nThis is one of the many double binds the mainstream of the Democratic Party has put itself in: it not only relies on the support of black voters but is simultaneously trying to poach more conservative white voters from Republicans. When the Republicans respond in kind, trying to entice more people of color to their side, mainstream commentators get confused: this is not supposed to be possible.\n\nFor years, mainstream commentators heralded a coming \" demographic wave ,\" when people of color would be the majority in the United States and white people a plurality, making the country \"majority minority.\" If you've convinced yourself that demographics equal destiny and people of color \"naturally\" vote for the Democrats, Democratic victories appear inevitable. This argument was everywhere during the Trump administration, reassuring Democrats that their eventual return to permanent power was settled social scientific fact.\n\nThis narrative has proved to be both misguided and racist. First, it relied on the assumption that Latinos - the fastest-growing ethnic group in the United States - would always identify as Democrats - something that isn't borne out by the data.\n\nSecond, it assumed that the GOP wouldn't, or couldn't, offer any kind of alternative to the mainstream of the Democratic Party that people of color would support. This has also proven false. While people of color still vote disproportionately for Democrats, the 2020 election revealed that rule to be as malleable as any other. Donald Trump actually gained ground among minority voters during his reelection campaign, despite four years of racist fearmongering, political violence, and his alliance with the far right.\n\nThese essentialist assumptions fall into precisely the kind of racist tropes that the Democrats claim to oppose, assuming a kind of static, intrinsic, across-the-board progressive bent to voters of color. But like all essentialist assumptions, this is wrong.\n\nFor example, while black voters in the United States have moved left on the issue over time, a majority of them still find abortion to be \"morally unacceptable.\" Another supermajority of black voters, the highest proportion of all racial groups polled, said that gender was permanently determined by ones' assigned sex at birth, squarely at odds with both trans rights activists and the position of the Democratic Party. A majority of Hispanic voters in Flordia support conservative governor Ron DeSantis's racist actions against undocumented immigrants, which saw the state government intentionally lie to a group of immigrants and put them on a plane to Martha's Vineyard in an arguably illegal political stunt.\n\nThe coalition that currently votes for Democrats in the United States is contingent and malleable. The GOP can win over members of that coalition in their favor - perhaps especially if Democrats continue pursuing a politics that treats racial representation as if it were the full extent of their program for racial justice.\n\nAnother clear example of this inadequacy is the ascension of Rishi Sunak in the United Kingdom, the country's first ever prime minister who is not white. President Joe Biden and other commentators have hailed his election as an historic moment but have neglected to mention that Sunak's being of South Asian descent or being the descendant of immigrants doesn't mean that he or his party will support freedom of movement or the provision of increased rights for migrants. In fact, it seems that his government is poised to enact the same kinds of reactionary policies that previous Conservative governments have throughout the UK's history.\n\nEven the extreme right wing, which in the United States has always been deeply tied to white supremacism, has in countries from Brazil to India been accompanied by very different politics of race and ethnicity. The Brazilian Integralist Action , Brazil's fascist party from the 1930s, had many non-white members and also several regional leaders who were black, even as it was aligning itself with European fascists. And recently defeated Jair Bolsonaro fared surprisingly well with non-white voters in Brazil despite his open racism. In India the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh , a Hindu nationalist organization deeply connected to both the country's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and to networks of far-right militants, espouses a form of nationalism and racism that is focused on religious sectarianism rather than whiteness. Even the Italian National Fascist Party originally avoided the antisemitic policies that obsessed the Nazis, only later adopting them when pressured by their allies.\n\nA politics of empty racial representation that does not actually advance any sort of substantively progressive politics and leaves out the basic, material issues affecting the lives of Democrats' most important and most oppressed constituents presents the Right with a golden opportunity - one that Republicans are currently seizing.\n\nCraig Johnson has a PhD in history from the University of California Berkeley, where his work focused on the right wing and the Catholic Church in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Spain. He hosts a podcast called Fifteen Minutes of Fascism , a weekly news and analysis show covering the global rise of the radical right.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Yet too many ignore class differences and political complexities among millions of African Americans.\n\nPeople participate in a march in Brooklyn for Black Lives Matter and to commemorate the 155th anniversary of Juneteenth on June 19, 2020 in New York City. (Spencer Platt / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nAt forty-seven million, the African American population in the United States is roughly equivalent to that of Spain. Despite the size of one of America's largest minorities, discussions of black politics tend to be reductive and ahistorical. In cavalier fashion, critics of racism chart a long line of oppression that has its origin in the United States' earliest days. Similarly, the forces that have, according to the dominant view of American racism, sought to oppose this monolithic racial tyranny have all fought under the single banner of \"the black liberation struggle.\"\n\nAdmittedly, these attempts to examine the history of discrimination offer correctives to right-wing defenses of forms of ascriptive hierarchy. However, they do so at the cost of flattening the complexities of actually existing black politics. This approach ignores, the political theorist Adolph Reed Jr tells Jacobin , that black politics is not immune from the economic and class forces which have and continue to shape American politics more broadly.\n\nYou've been a longtime critic of the notion of a cohesive or transhistorical \"black freedom movement,\" or the idea that one can trace an unbroken line from the fight to abolish slavery to the civil rights movement to Black Lives Matter. Why isn't this framework helpful for understanding black politics either now or in the past?\n\nWhen people talk about something called the \"black freedom movement\" or the \"black liberation struggle\" or the \"long civil rights movement,\" they're rehashing an old trope that goes back to the beginnings of the study of black American political history and black American political thought. At that time, that construct was called something like the \"Negro's struggle for freedom\" or \"Negro's quest for equality.\" Both then and now, the construct presumes, first of all, that black people are a singular collective entity. It also presumes an overarching struggle where black people have always unanimously wanted the same thing, and that whatever disagreements you might encounter if you go through the archives of black politics are just disagreements within a fundamentally shared commitment.\n\nSo the main problem with the idea of a timeless black freedom movement is that it's a single-thread narrative and a reduction of a much more complex reality. The narrative posits racial unity as the essential foundation for understanding black people and constructs and imposes an anti-historical understanding of black people's experiences in American political life. It defines black people as being somehow outside of history and collapses differences in historical moments by presuming that people are fighting for the same things in 2020 that they were fighting for in 1860 - or 1619, for God's sake - which is absurd.\n\nWhy do you think people find this idea of a singular and cohesive black freedom movement so compelling?\n\nI think there are several reasons. One is simply that people have heard it over and over, so it seems to comport with commonsense knowledge. It's a framework that gives you the familiar dyads of Booker T. Washington versus W. E. B. Du Bois, Du Bois versus Marcus Garvey, and Malcolm X versus Martin Luther King Jr. That's convenient for people who don't think there's anything complex that goes on among black people.\n\nThen there are people who have an interest in propagating the narrative. The black freedom movement construct has always functioned to obscure real distinctions among black people. Fundamentally, the most aggressive and insistent proponents of this view have been people who are pushing a class program: any interpretation of black politics that doesn't account for political conflict among black people - as opposed to politics between black people and everyone else - is intrinsically a class politics because it's part of a discourse of what Barbara Fields and Karen Fields call racecraft , which obscures class differentiation among black Americans, with or without conscious intent. If the black freedom movement narrative were even a reasonably accurate account of black American political history, then you could say, okay, well, it doesn't hurt to talk about it. But it's not. It's false and it works for the other side.\n\nThe alternative to this kind of simplistic approach is to recognize that black people, like all people, live within historical circumstances. They're diverse and have different interests and perceptions, not only at different points in time, but also at the same point. That was true in the nineteenth century and even true to some extent in the eighteenth century. It's certainly true after Emancipation and once black people were able to claim some kind of civic participation, however badly the deck may have been stacked against them. Eric Foner has compiled a list of black people who held elected office in the South by the end of Reconstruction, and there were hundreds of people who had been elected to all kinds of offices. And that suggests that there was a lively culture of political debate and struggle, and that blacks engaged with nonblacks, as they always have and continue to do today.\n\nIt really comes down to following an injunction from Ralph Ellison: he cautioned observers of American life against the tendency to believe things about black people that they would not believe about any other human beings.\n\nHow, then, should we think about black politics now, particularly after the 2020 racial reckoning?\n\nI'm probably getting more crotchety by the day, but I would almost argue at this point that the most crucial racial reckoning in US history was at Fort Wagner, South Carolina, in 1864.\n\nAnyway, to answer your question, at the beginning of the 2020 Bernie Sanders campaign, Touré [Reed] was talking to a mutual friend and colleague who was part of the campaign's inner circle and encouraged the campaign not to concentrate on pursuing something called the \"black vote\" as much as they could possibly avoid it. His argument was that what we think of as \"black politics\" today is a class-specific interest-group politics that's rooted entirely in the black professional and managerial strata, whose approach to political life is race reductionist . It's an elite-driven activity that really has no base at all. And the reality is that once you start catering to the idea of a coherent \"black vote\" or \"black community,\" it's going to drag you down and lead to demise.\n\nAnd then there's the Potemkin thing that happens whenever there's a police atrocity or some other outrage: people respond to the outrage with protest actions, and then somebody who's articulate and MSNBC-ready jumps out in front of the protest and talks to the media and is declared the new voice of the black youth or the rising wave of the future.\n\nThe dynamic of outrage and protests as a response is at least a half-century old. In fact, when Touré was an infant and we lived in Atlanta, I got to see that role acted out firsthand in the local political scene by Hosea Williams, a former aide to Martin Luther King Jr whose political persona was all about being true to the activist roots of the [Southern Christian Leadership Conference]. Whenever there was something like a police shooting, Hosea would march it off - he'd jump out and lead a protest march someplace. And then he'd go inside and essentially negotiate payoffs with the people who were in charge. And I'd already seen the same thing happen when I lived in North Carolina before I went to graduate school. So it's not anything new, but it's hegemonic at this point.\n\nThere's another tendency in this type of politics that I trace back to the buildup to the anti-WTO demos in Seattle in 1999. There were activists during that moment who complained that the movement was too white and wasn't doing enough to reach out to affected \"communities.\" And I'd say to people, look, if there's some constituency that isn't involved that you think ought to be - and you purport to have connections to that constituency - then the thing to do is for you to go out and organize them and bring them into the movement.\n\nWell, of course nobody who was complaining actually wanted that; what they wanted was just the opposite. They wanted to represent or embody the amorphous, voiceless masses. And that's really the only context - that and nineteenth-century race theory - within which it makes sense to assume that the black American population, which is bigger than the entire population of Canada, can be spoken for in the first person plural.\n\nYou and Walter Benn Michaels have a new book out, No Politics But Class Politics . Over the years you've both been sharply critical of the tendency to focus on racial disparities . While there do exist plenty of liberals whose idea of justice is a diverse ruling class, what would you tell leftists who oppose the capitalist order but also want to take racism seriously? What does it mean to fight racism today?\n\nOf course we should do what we can to protect and buttress the antidiscrimination apparatus, which includes an affirmative dimension. But this might also be of interest to readers:\n\nIn 1945, when the Full Employment Bill was still in play in Congress, the civil rights activist and legal scholar Pauli Murray wrote an article in the California Law Review on employment discrimination. In the article, she addresses the argument that you have to fight racism or discrimination before you can win social democracy. She points out that the reality is that racism becomes most politically viable in conditions of scarcity: when jobs are scarce, that's when people get anxious, and that's when employers and right-wingers can mobilize the anxiety. And so Murray argues that because of that, the only way to move forward as black workers is to win the social democratic reforms - in particular, at that moment, the struggle for a real political commitment to ground national economic policy on the pursuit and maintenance of a full employment economy - and that those are ultimately even more important than the antidiscrimination measures themselves.\n\nMost people in this country who work for a living need the same things, right? And we don't necessarily need to have a fight over what happened in 1860, or a fight over what happened in 1890, or even 1920, or even 1960 to recognize that we all need economic security, health care, jobs, and education. And the way for us to get to those things is to articulate our needs and to come together around the things we have in common.\n\nWhen the anti-racist sensibility now is that making a reference to the working class is somehow conceding to white racism, it's pretty clear what the class character of this politics is. And this is even before you start counting up all the billions of corporate and investor-class dollars that have gone to Black Lives Matter and other nominal antiracist activist groups since the murder of George Floyd.\n\nSo it's time for us to stop playing around and to be serious and hardheaded about this. Especially for those of us who are professors, part of our job is trying to get the story straight, to demystify the mystifications. That's what we do for a living, right? Otherwise, we should all just go to church.\n\nAdolph Reed is professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nJennifer C.

So why do Democrats want to put the state's primary first? Because it helps Joe Biden and hurts the Left.\n\nA man fills out a ballot at a voting booth in Mt Gilead, North Carolina.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nWait ― South Carolina?\n\nThat's the plan, as personally requested by President Joe Biden and approved near-unanimously by the Democratic Party Rules and Bylaws Committee this past Friday. If approved by the full Democratic National Committee (DNC), the new schedule would have the Palmetto State vote first on February 3, then New Hampshire, and now, Nevada three days later, Georgia a week after that, and Michigan after two more weeks. In effect, the plan pushes up the diverse, regionally significant states that have become pivotal to Democratic success in elections, while giving South Carolina the pivotal position currently claimed, in different ways, by both Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nTo be blunt, this doesn't make much sense. South Carolina hasn't voted Democratic in a presidential election since Jimmy Carter ran in 1976, a blip in an otherwise unbroken red streak dating back to the passage of the Civil Rights Act. It hasn't had a Democratic senator since 2005. Six of its last eight governors were Republican, and it's had twenty straight years of a GOP trifecta at the state level, something the Democrats haven't achieved even once in the last three decades. Biden lost the state by twelve points in 2020, an election that also saw the Democratic senate candidate (and current DNC chair) thumped by ten points despite raising more money than any Senate candidate in history.\n\nSimply put, as the current trend lines go, South Carolina isn't a battleground state, and Democratic chances of winning it anytime soon are minimal. So why is it being given the king-making power to set the front-runner and hand them potentially insurmountable momentum?\n\nBoth Biden and South Carolina representative James Clyburn have pointed to the state's diversity to explain the choice. \"You cannot be the Democratic nominee and win a general election unless you have overwhelming support from voters of color ― and that includes Black, Brown and Asian American & Pacific Islander voters,\" Biden wrote in his letter to the committee requesting the changes.\n\nBut that can't be right. South Carolina may be 27 percent black, but it's nearly 70 percent white, only 2 percent Asian, and 6.4 percent Latino. While the rest of the country has gotten more diverse, the state is about as white as it was more than a decade ago - whiter , actually - with the 2020 Census putting it at the very bottom in terms of how little the diversity of its racial and ethnic makeup had changed.\n\nIf diversity is the priority, then Georgia - an actual battleground state now and one that's taken on growing strategic and symbolic significance in Democratic thinking in recent years - is a much better candidate , with fewer whites, a higher proportion of blacks, and significantly more Asians and Latinos than South Carolina. And strictly speaking, Nevada - another state Democrats have actually won in the last sixty years and in the last four elections no less - comes the closest to reflecting the actual demographic makeup of the country as a whole .\n\nDemocrats have wasted no time in calling critics of this proposal racist, casting any objection to this scheme as dismissal or disrespect of African Americans, and stressing the importance of giving black voters a leading voice in choosing the nominee. Here's the inconvenient fact they won't tell you: that it was a considerable number of old, white voters , in a state getting older and whiter, who played a key role in giving Biden his lopsided victory in the state two years ago.\n\nLook at the voter roll demographics for South Carolina's democratic primary in 2016 and 2020 , and you'll notice something pretty quick. While the number of \"nonwhite\" voters went up by more than 24,000 to hit 268,355 in 2020, this was dwarfed by the nearly 142,000-person surge in the white voter rolls over those four years, giving white voters a 230-vote edge that year over their nonwhite counterparts - who, let's remember, counted a significant number of Latinos and other ethnic groups, not just African Americans. Meanwhile, among age groups that year, it was the forty-five to sixty-four and sixty-five-and-up crowds that saw the biggest gains, with the surge in all voters under forty-four not even coming close to equaling the gains made by the (already sizable) forty-five to sixty-four crowd alone. (The over-sixty-fives easily saw the biggest gains).\n\nThis was reflected in the voting results. While exit polls had Biden dominating among the black vote, the Washington Post also found that it was the whitest, wealthiest areas of the state that saw the biggest jumps in turnout, with Biden likewise dominating among this group, as well as among elderly voters more generally. And since South Carolina is an open primary, and that year saw no GOP contest, it's all but certain a good chunk of these were Republican voters. (According to exit polls, Biden ended up winning fully 51 percent of \"moderate or conservative\" voters, a far larger margin than other ideologies).\n\nIn other words, while Biden would have almost certainly won the state that year no matter what, his massive, nearly thirty-point domination of his next-closest rival, Bernie Sanders, was partly propelled by a surge of old, white, wealthy, and conservative voters. Democrats touted these results as a good omen for the general election (\"These numbers should scare Republicans,\" the state party's chair said at the time), only for them to be decimated at both the national and state levels come November anyway. And it hasn't gotten better: this year, the GOP incumbent won reelection as governor with the largest margin in more than twenty years.\n\nIt objectively makes little to no sense - from the standpoint of electoral strategy, ideology, or even representation - to give South Carolina of all states such a powerful role in deciding an ostensibly progressive party's electoral prospects. So why on Earth is it happening?\n\nThe most important reason is that Biden is a vulnerable incumbent who needs to guard against a potential primary challenge. In spite of a surprisingly strong Democratic showing in the midterms, Biden's approval rating is still underwater , and despite putting on a public air of confidence in the president, both Democratic lawmakers and party apparatchiks are less than enthusiastic when given the chance to speak honestly, with even Michelle Obama declining to endorse a second Biden run.\n\nBy putting in first place the state that single-handedly salvaged his 2020 campaign, whose state party is dominated by a loyal ally, and which is sure to vote for him in large numbers, Biden can set up an early momentum to stave off a potential challenger. As David Axelrod put it to the New York Times : \"He's created a firewall against any insurgency.\"\n\nBut there's also another reason, which is that it would advance a long-standing goal of corporate Democrats to strengthen the hand of party conservatives and limit the chances of voters nominating a progressive.\n\nBack in the 1980s, after civil rights legislation effectively flipped the entire South red and Ronald Reagan used this realignment to win several landslides, Biden himself (though hailing from a border state) was part of a group of Southern Democrats who pushed to give Southern states a greater say in the party's nominating process. They hoped this would tilt the eventual pick in a conservative direction and help the party compete with Republicans in the once solidly Democratic region.\n\nThe party's presidential hopefuls made this strategy clear, as just one example, in 1983, while converging in Georgia for a fundraising-record-breaking black-tie gala for the annual Jefferson-Jackson dinner, named for the two slave-owning former Democratic presidents. Ohio senator and ex-astronaut John Glenn announced to those assembled that \"the South isn't just in the mainstream, it is the mainstream,\" while Georgia party chief Paul Weston insisted that \"whoever wins the nomination has to have the South and to get the South he must be a centrist candidate.\"\n\n\"Over and over, southerners who collared the candidates at cocktail parties warned against catering to homosexuals, unions, feminists, and other groups that traditionally are detested by southern conservatives,\" the Miami Herald reported at the time.\n\nThe major legacy of this effort was Super Tuesday, the primary voting extravaganza that sees the largest number of states vote for a nominee on the same day, and which had initially been comprised entirely of fourteen Southern and border states. The strategy initially didn't work: black progressive Jesse Jackson, born in South Carolina, did tremendously well the first time it was tried in 1988 to the horror of its creators, and Massachusetts liberal Michael Dukakis ended up becoming the nominee when all was said and done.\n\nBut the party's Southern bloc got its wish four years later, after the party turned South Carolina - having been a caucus that took place four days after Super Tuesday - into a primary held three days before the fourteen-state extravaganza. Thanks to the change, the conservative state had a pivotal new status of conferring momentum to a candidate going into the pivotal Tuesday, when a large chunk of all party delegates (one-third in 2020) would be doled out.\n\nThat year, Arkansas \"moderate\" Bill Clinton was the major beneficiary of the change, having spent more time and resources than anyone else campaigning in South Carolina, ultimately taking the nomination. Nearly thirty years later, the move again worked as intended, when the more conservative Biden's domination in the conservative state upended the narrative of the race, halting his rival's sense of momentum and granting him more than $ 100 million worth of free media over the three days going into Super Tuesday, despite having fared dismally in both the diverse state of Nevada and the lily-white states of Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nEven so, the Southerners' strategy on the whole had mixed success, since those two states continued to kick off voting and so set the narrative in ways not necessarily helpful for the party's centrists. But replacing them with South Carolina could have a game-changing effect, letting a state where even its ( mostly older ) black voters tend to be more conservative , or at least more loyal to the party establishment, have this momentum-setting power.\n\nWhether or not this will actually go through remains to be seen, since it's already meeting resistance from establishment Democrats. Some of that is, unsurprisingly, from Iowa and New Hampshire officials reluctant to give up their states' positions in the schedule, but it's also come from Democrats from other states who prefer putting Nevada first, including the PACs for both the Congressional Black and Hispanic Caucuses .\n\nThe party might end up thanking these naysayers. The United States is a different country than it was in the 1980s and 1990s, when the conventional wisdom held a candidate had to be anti-union, socially conservative, and make racist dog whistles to win the presidency. Giving South Carolina an outsize role in picking the nominee might be good for Biden, but it may not prove all that good for the party's future electoral fortunes.\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .

But we can't write off the South as hopelessly reactionary - there's a base for progressive politics that speaks to workers of all races.\n\nA polling station setup in the St Thomas Episcopal Church in Birmingham, Alabama.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nFor fifty years, the economist Gavin Wright has been writing about the political economy of the American South. Along with economists like Robert Fogel and Stanley Engerman, he helped pioneer economic modeling techniques to understand the history of American slavery. His books The Political Economy of the Cotton South and Old South, New South: Revolutions in the Southern Economy Since the Civil War are classic studies of the Southern economy's evolution.\n\nRecently, Wright has turned his attention to the twentieth century, examining the economic impact of the mid-century Civil Rights Movement in Sharing the Prize: The Economics of the Civil Rights Revolution in the American South . Though recent history writing has tended to downplay the impact of the Civil Rights Movement in light of continuing racial inequality, Wright's book shows that the rise in black voting following the Voting Rights Act had important consequences for things like black access to public services.\n\nLast month, he released a new paper with the Institute for New Economic Thinking looking at the way Southern politics were reshaped in the decades following the Civil Rights Movement. Taking on the popular idea that the Republican \"Southern Strategy\" of using coded racial appeals led inevitably to GOP dominance in the South, he argues that Southern politics was competitive until 1994, when NAFTA triggered massive deindustrialization, rendering white workers much more receptive to racial scapegoating.\n\nWright recently spoke with Jacobin's Paul Heideman about his research and how progressives can make a play for the ostensibly deep red South. Their conversation has been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nThere's a potted history of Southern politics that goes something like this: you had a one-party South that was ruled by the Democratic Party on the basis of black exclusion, and then the Civil Rights Movement broke that monopoly. The Republican Party saw an opportunity and used coded racial appeals (the \"Southern Strategy\") to replace the Democrats as the default party of the region on the same foundation of racist white votes.\n\nYour paper starts out by assembling quite a bit of evidence that this story misses some of the most interesting dynamics in Southern politics. So what are some of the main things you think are wrong with that kind of standard story?\n\nIt certainly was a radical change and reconstruction of Southern politics in the sixties. One of the quotes most often repeated in this history that you're talking about is what Lyndon B. Johnson (LBJ) supposedly said to Bill Moyers after the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964. Johnson said, \"I think we've given the South to the Republicans for a generation.\"\n\nPeople quote it because it seems to fit so accurately. But that was before the passing of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, which dramatically increased black registration and, really, LBJ was not one to give things away for nothing. So it's pretty clear that they were making a political calculation, that it would be possible to build a biracial coalition that would command a majority in many, if not all, Southern states.\n\nThere was a telephone interview between Martin Luther King Jr and LBJ, and King said, \"Mr. President, look at the states you lost here. You could have won with the black vote.\" So I think that is the way they were thinking. And I think that's largely what happened.\n\nThe elections in 1970 were something of a crossroads in that the outright segregationist appeal was certainly still prominent, but those candidates lost badly that year, and most Southern politicians, who were indeed mainly Democrats at that time, changed their tune. A pretty radical change in rhetoric. Maybe that's only skin deep, but it reflected a change in the voters they were going after.\n\nHow did that shake out politically?\n\nYou had a string of moderate \"New South\" governors from 1970 onward whose pitch was, \"Let's put the race issue behind us. It's settled. Maybe we didn't get what we want, but we have to live with it, and let's get behind a pro-growth platform, which is going to be good for everybody.\"\n\nOne of my favorite figures is the electoral college map, which I put up and say, \"What year is this?\" People rarely get it, because what it shows is most of the South going Democratic and the West Coast going Republican. The answer - which even professional historians take a while to get - is that it's 1976, Jimmy Carter's election year. Jimmy Carter epitomizes one of these new South governors. Yes, moderate by national terms, but progressive on the race issue and clearly leading a coalition in which blacks are a part.\n\nWas that just an anomalous year, a Watergate backlash? Yes, there were elements of that. But I think it's the path that was there to be taken in terms of the biracial coalition in the South.\n\nNow, what I've done is something I don't recommend to anybody: I think I've read every survey by leading political scientists from the seventies through the nineties. These are people on the ground observing things, not just historians trying to make sense of it after the fact. And that's exactly what they were saying in the seventies and eighties and on into the nineties - that things in the South have changed, the race issue is receding.\n\nIn 2020 it might be hard for us to believe that anyone thought that. But these were people who were politically knowledgeable, and their perception was that Southern politics were coming to resemble the rest of the nation in that sense - more based on class, more based on conservative Republicans and Democratic working class, black and white. Of course, that's a casual description, but there was statistical evidence behind it.\n\nYou talk also in your piece about the emergence of black politics in the South, in the wake of the Voting Rights Act in particular, and how that transformed the South. Could you talk about that a little?\n\nThere was a lot of frustration at the slow rate of progress among black voters and black politicians. But black voter registration wasn't slow at all. It was quite dramatic. Translating that into black elected officials took a lot longer.\n\nDon't misread the alternative narrative that I was just giving here about the South rejoining the nation. The white South was certainly pushing back, not so much in the racist rhetoric, but in what is known as vote dilution strategies - changing, for example, from individual member districts to at-large voting. So even though blacks could vote, it was much more difficult for them to actually get their chosen elected official one way or another. There was a lot of litigation over that in the courts.\n\nBut despite Nixon's \"Southern Strategy,\" the truth is that the courts were continuing to enforce the civil rights laws, including the Voting Rights Act. The idea was that voting rights were not just a matter of letting an individual go in and mark a ballot. It had to be effective. It had to be something that could have a meaningful effect on outcome.\n\nThe upshot of that was an increase in black elected officials, with a lag. There's a lot of evidence that it makes a difference, with a couple of new studies showing us that you can identify an effect from black voting on various share in revenues and services for local neighborhoods. This is at the municipal level, county level, and state level.\n\nSo it is not that race consciousness was dropping out or disappearing - that would be a very unrealistic way of reading it. But there was a coalition, and even though the Democratic Party was, as I say, moderate by national standards, what we can see is that being Democrats made a difference and being part of a biracial coalition made a difference. We can see that in dramatic terms, in terms of the kinds of policy shifts that have been implemented when the Republicans did take command of Southern states, as they did in virtually every single one.\n\nOne interesting moment in your paper concerns Strom Thurmond, the ultimate Dixiecrat, and how his approach to the race question had to take account of these new realities. Can you talk a little bit about that?\n\nIn 1970, after supporting a segregationist candidate who lost badly, he changed his tune. He appointed a black assistant. He actually began to compete in his very conservative way for the black vote. He supported black candidates for judgeships.\n\nYou might say he himself was exceptional here, having switched over to the Republicans early, in 1964. Yet at that time, it wasn't entirely clear that the Republican and Democratic parties were going to divide up in the extreme way that they later did. It wasn't clear the Republicans were going to become, essentially an all-white party, not really even pretending to campaign for the black vote and using dog-whistle politics.\n\nSo Strom Thurmond actually wasn't a leader. He was adjusting to the new political reality.\n\nEven as late as the 1980s, there wasn't intense racial polarization between the two parties. You point to 1994 as a key moment where the balance shifted. Why 1994?\n\nYou think of the great turning-point elections in American history. 1860 was about slavery, 1896 was about free silver, 1932 was about the Great Depression. 1994 - what was it?  Yes, it was the year of the Gingrich revolution. He went public with a manifesto and a platform. But that's as much the outcome as an explanation. Almost any year, you could find something dramatic like that.\n\nAnother interpretation that I think has a lot of truth to it is that the Republicans could see they were within striking range of retaking the House, which they had not done since the 1950s. So you had a top-down, heavily financed campaign, which targeted vulnerable representatives and which did a lot of focus group-type research. But you still have to have responsive voters, and these Southern Democratic white working-class voters were pretty well-informed in terms of what they wanted: protection from foreign trade. The big headline issue for 1994 was NAFTA.\n\nThere are very odd elements about this narrative, because NAFTA was a Republican initiative and Clinton came in and had to decide what he might do with it. He decided to support it and these white working-class Democratic voters felt betrayed. They had been sticking with the party, and whatever their politics on race, they were quite willing to be part of a biracial coalition.\n\nSo I think you get two things happening. One was a political reaction. People were following those events carefully, and even before the damage hit, they were retaliating. They were furious, and the anger was taken out on Bill Clinton. All the other basis for hostility to Bill Clinton and his wife came out at that time.\n\nAnother one was the vote to phase out the Multi Fibre Arrangement (MFA), which was a quota system and had kept the American textile industry afloat. That was the same year and if anything, the effects in terms of textile imports were even more dramatic.\n\nSo step one was the political response. Step two was the devastating effect of deindustrialization from both of these measures, so that it was undermining the basis for this biracial coalition. A very good book on this is by Tim Minchin, called Empty Mills .\n\nWe can look back at communities trying to hang on to their factories, and say, look, it was hopeless. There's no way they could have succeeded. But they could have strung it out, and they had succeeded at least in stringing things out for quite a while.\n\nThey made a conscious point of saying, yes we, the textiles industry, used to be segregated, but we've reformed our ways. We now employ large numbers of women and minorities and that's why you should support us. So this was a progressive appeal, and it actually had a fair amount of success until 1994. The Southern labor force was never highly unionized, but it was somewhat unionized, and the unions punched well above their weight in terms of support for measures like this. But they were completely undermined.\n\nOne way to frame it is that these white Southern Democrats were voting their economic interests until 1994, and after that they were voting their emotions. You may say, well, how could they vote for Republicans since NAFTA was a Republican initiative? But they were angry at Bill Clinton, and many of them turned and voted for Ross Perot.\n\nRepublicans were by then tuning into the kind of rhetoric and signals and cultural appeals that have helped define them since. These are somewhat euphemistic terms that were going to appeal to white voters who had been set adrift. Many black workers were also displaced by NAFTA and the MFA and de-industrialization, and they didn't turn Republican, with rare exceptions. So you really have to have a narrative that is subtle enough, nuanced enough, to see both a biracial coalition united by economic interests, and then how it broke down and was replaced by non-economic appeals.\n\nWhat were some of the fruits of Republican dominance of the South after 1994? How did that transform Southern political economy?\n\nIn terms of state policy, some of that came pretty late - the actual takeover of both houses and the governorships. Nationally speaking, the effect came earlier. Take an example like welfare reform . I mean, that was Bill Clinton's signature issue , \"ending welfare as we know it.\" It is perfectly true that what he had had in mind was a much more constructive effort. But what came out of a Republican-dominated Congress was pretty bad.\n\nThe key to it was local control, state control. They weren't quite using the phrase \"state's rights\" in the same aggressive way that the segregationists did. But what they meant and what they carried out was not that different. Actual cash aid was virtually eliminated because the states now had the right to determine policy, and the worst offenders were the Deep South states, which have the largest black population.\n\nSo that would be an example. It's a matter of national legislation opening the door to state decisions.\n\nAnother indicator that I look at, because you can track it over long periods of time, is support for public education. So I look at per-pupil spending in Southern states as a percentage of the national average. The South was way behind in the 1950s and 1960s. But as part of that economic progress, what seemed to be the economic convergence with the rest of the country, there were increases in per-pupil spending, and they were coming right up to the rest of the country.\n\nWhat you see after Republican takeover is a reversal of decades of progress. To some extent, it's a matter of simply the states being starved of revenue. But you also have an active hostility towards public schools. They call them government schools and, in many cases, the South has had the most racially integrated public schools in the nation. Some of this was the retreat from integration by the courts, so that you get this active hostility, often with a color-coded theme to it.\n\nThe notion being (and this is not just the South, we have similar thinking in California), \"public schools are dominated by minorities, and why should we spend our tax money to support them?\" That kind of specter, that fear that integration was going to destroy public schools was there in the sixties, but at the time it didn't happen. You see in the beginning the best of both worlds, both progress toward integration and also progress toward upgrading Southern schools relative to the national average. That has largely come to an end almost everywhere in the South. It's a sad story.\n\nMoving into the present, since 2016, there's been a debate among progressives about whether it's possible to win back white workers. What does your work suggest about what might be necessary to reestablish a large base among these voters in the South?\n\nI'm writing about 1994 partly as a way of saying, don't give up on the South, don't think \"Oh those white southerners, they're hopeless because they're racist and we can't even deal with them.\" No, it was a biracial coalition before and there can be a biracial coalition again that is successful.\n\nI still think the key is to have a program that addresses genuine issues that are faced by working-class or lower income people, black, white and brown, because increasingly it will have to be a multiracial coalition. I think that's the formula, the only defensible formula, that is going to work. I don't think we should give up on anyone, especially not people where there is a valid basis for supporting progressives.\n\nNow we're talking mainly about the South, and we should, but when I look at states that adhere to this kind of scenario - a Republican takeover followed by adverse effects on public policy - Indiana and Wisconsin very much fit the same Southern scenario. I wouldn't want to call that the Southernization, but it's a similar dynamic.\n\nYou get a job displacement. White workers feel they were abandoned by the Democratic Party. And they have good reason to feel that way. No, we can't really reverse the trade policies very much, but we can encourage manufacturing and rural development programs in general. The big cleavage between urban and rural voting patterns is something that can be addressed, and it should be addressed.\n\nYou don't need a majority of disaffected white voters to make it worthwhile, to go after their votes. Cutting into the Trump majority, or the Republican majority, can be the effect that makes a difference. We also see, on this theme of local control or state control, the question of Medicaid expansion. Republican states, primarily the ones in the South, refused to do it, leaving money on the table.\n\nIn quite a number of states, this policy has been reversed by referendums. Yes, the white working class often votes against its own economic interests, but not all the time. Sometimes, if the issue is direct enough and meaningful enough, people will vote on it.\n\nHispanic voters are going to be central moving forward. They are, in a way, the most underrepresented group in the South. The vote suppression tactics that Republicans have been using targets Hispanics almost more than African-Americans, because they vote in such small numbers and they're more susceptible to intimidation tactics.\n\nIt's almost commonplace to say demography is on the side of the Democrats. But it will not just happen automatically, because the resistance is fierce. A lot of this is up for grabs. I am optimistic - or at least optimistic enough to think that it's worth pursuing the struggle.\n\nGavin Wright is an economic historian and the William Robertson Professor of American Economic History emeritus at Stanford University.\n\nPaul Heideman holds a PhD in American studies from Rutgers University-Newark.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

He's wrong - and it's time we set the record straight about both the New Deal's real flaws and its overall hugely egalitarian impact on workers of all races, including black workers.\n\nHouse majority whip Jim Clyburn on September 23, 2020 in Washington, DC. (Stefani Reynolds / Pool-Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIs Joseph Robinette Biden Jr the new Franklin Delano Roosevelt? Many people would certainly like to think so. Prominent among them is his chief of staff, Ron Klain, who has enthusiastically pushed the comparison.\n\nMany on the Left are, of course, skeptical of such premature canonization. But skepticism has also come from another direction. Recently, House majority whip Jim Clyburn argued that \"if [Biden's] going to have credibility, [he] must be much closer to Harry Truman than to Franklin Roosevelt. . . . I hear people talking about Joe Biden all the time comparing him to FDR. FDR's legacy was not good for black people.\"\n\nClyburn's skepticism about FDR's legacy for racial inequality vocalizes what's become a common theme in liberal-progressive views of the New Deal. While FDR's administration was the lodestar for liberal ideals into the 1970s, recently, both scholars and activists have argued that the New Deal in fact served mainly to entrench racial inequality in the United States through its exclusions of black workers. In the words of political scientist Ira Katznelson , many of its programs functioned as affirmative action for white people.\n\nIn the current moment, this revisionist perspective on the New Deal has dovetailed with contemporary liberalism's conviction that racial disparities can only be remedied by race-specific programs and that universalist social policy is inevitably exclusionary. But such a perspective occludes the radically egalitarian politics of many New Deal programs.\n\nBefore discussing the New Deal's importance for racial equality, however, it's important to acknowledge some of the real points its critics have made. Many New Deal programs did deepen racial inequality by offering a hand to white workers while denying one to black workers. The most central of these is undoubtedly the Federal Housing Administration, which subsidized mortgages. In cooperation with the banks, the FHA denied mortgages to home buyers in black neighborhoods, enforcing segregation even in cities without Jim Crow laws . Many other programs operated on a segregated basis and handed out less aid to black workers than white.\n\nBut if this were the only story of the New Deal and race, it would be difficult to explain why, after seventy years in which black voters followed Frederick Douglass's judgment that \"the Republican Party is the ship, all else is the sea,\" they enthusiastically joined the New Deal electoral coalition in 1936.\n\nIn 1932, when FDR challenged Herbert Hoover, this attachment to the party of Lincoln still held. Across the urban North, where the vast majority of black voters lived (black Southerners were largely disenfranchised), scholars estimate that Hoover received between two-thirds and three-quarters of the black vote . A mere four years later, the new GOP standard-bearer, Alf Landon, had a very strong civil rights record . He supported federal anti-lynching legislation, and his campaign directly targeted the discriminatory administration of many New Deal programs. Despite this, he received about 28 percent of the black vote. Black voters had finally, in the words of one black newspaper editor, \"turn[ed] the picture of Abraham Lincoln to the wall.\"\n\nIf the New Deal was, in Clyburn's words, \"not good for black people,\" this transformation is unintelligible, if not perverse.\n\nIn fact, even as some New Deal programs entrenched racial inequality, others assailed it. Public employment programs in the New Deal employed huge numbers of black workers. Administrators like Harold Ickes, in charge of the Public Works Administration, were dedicated foes of racism and actually made sure their programs employed black workers proportionally more than white workers.\n\nOther programs contributed to the incredible explosion of black cultural production in the 1930s. Writers like Richard Wright and Arna Bontemps were paid by the Federal Writers' Project to write, supporting them and allowing them to develop their talents. Zora Neale Hurston, who later became a conservative critic of the welfare state and civil rights, was able to publish her classic novel Their Eyes Were Watching God in part because she had worked for the FWP chronicling the lives of black Southerners while writing it.\n\nAt the same time, the fillip the New Deal gave to labor organizing encouraged the formation of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), made up of unions who broke away from the exclusionary model of craft unionism promoted by the American Federation of Labor (AFL). Though the records of CIO unions on race varied, many embraced a model of civil rights unionism that challenged inequality both in the workplace and in the community. W. E. B. Du Bois said the CIO had been more successful in fighting racial prejudice than any movement in three decades.\n\nThe New Deal was big and complicated. A comprehensive assessment of its implications for racial equality is the task of a book, not an article. But one aspect of the New Deal deserves special attention, given its neglect in most discussions of this subject - the Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC).\n\nThe FEPC was established in 1941, as the United States prepared for its inevitable entry into World War II. Pressured by black socialist A. Philip Randolph , Roosevelt had issued Executive Order 8802, banning discrimination in defense industries (which in the wartime economy would be a substantial fraction of the whole). The FEPC was the body charged with making this goal a reality.\n\nFrom the start, the FEPC was hobbled by opposition from capital and Southern politicians. In the South, it was effectively a dead letter, as the combined strength of employers and local politicians easily overwhelmed the committee's meager resources. But elsewhere in the country, the committee worked by soliciting complaints about discrimination, holding public hearings into particularly recalcitrant employers, and working behind the scenes with employers, unions, and black workers to find ways to integrate the latter into the defense workforce.\n\nThe impact of this work was tremendous. During the 1940s, the black-white wage gap shrank more quickly than any decade since. For a long time, economists attributed this simply to wartime full employment and black migration from the low-wage South. But the FEPC was actually central to this progress. According to one scholar , about half of the progress in compressing racial wage differentials in this period was an effect of FEPC interventions.\n\nWhat's more, black workers eagerly seized on the FEPC as a weapon to be used in their struggles for equal employment. In industries from West Coast shipbuilding to Philadelphia public transit, black workers used FEPC hearings to publicize their grievances and as hubs for organizing their own actions against both employers and unions with discriminatory practices.\n\nPrecisely because the FEPC was so effective, it faced tremendous opposition during its entire existence. After the war, the fight to make the FEPC permanent failed in the face of conservative countermobilization. But in its brief life, it showed, more than any legislation since Reconstruction, what real policy dedicated to advancing racial equality would look like.\n\nWhen Alf Landon raised the discriminatory impact of some New Deal programs in 1936, he was trying to clip the wings of the egalitarian movement in the United States. Today, when centrist Democrats like Clyburn raise these same points, they are trying to accomplish something similar. Rather than a transformative presidency that raises people's expectations for what the government can do to them, Clyburn encourages Biden to emulate Harry Truman, a politician who failed in his domestic agenda while pursuing a disastrous foreign policy of imperialist bellicosity.\n\nOpposing the powerful forces pulling Biden's administration in a similar direction will require a vision of what egalitarian policy can look like, and the New Deal remains a powerful source for such a vision.\n\nPaul Heideman holds a PhD in American studies from Rutgers University-Newark.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

It's an effective strategy used by city elites to artificially inflate conservative political power.\n\nA recent annexation vote in Mobile, Alabama, will shrink the white-black voter gap by thousands. (Win McNamee / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nLast week's annexation vote in Mobile, Alabama, was pitched as a race to be among the biggest cities in the Southern state. The Gulf Coast city added more than fifteen thousand residents , hoisting Mobile above Montgomery and Birmingham, and just below Huntsville.\n\n\"God answers prayers! We're the second-largest city in Alabama!\" proclaimed Mobile mayor Sandy Stimpson.\n\nWhat annexation supporters were more reluctant to talk about was the racial disparity. Only 27 percent of the city's new residents are black, shrinking the white-black voter gap by thousands in a majority-minority city with a history of institutional racism.\n\nThe annexation was less God's plan than a years-long effort to \"Make Mobile Great Again\" by the city's elite Republican power players. The campaigners were led by Stimpson, a wealthy lumber scion who once served as Jeff Sessions's finance chairman.\n\nSince the era of the civil rights movement, annexing white suburbs has been a tool for Southern and Sunbelt cities seeking to dilute the black vote.\n\nIn 1970, Richmond, Virginia, annexed twenty-three square miles and fifty thousand people, primarily white. That instantly changed Virginia's capital from a majority-black to a majority-white city. The Supreme Court later ruled that the annexation had been made for racial reasons and placed an injunction on Richmond's municipal elections for seven years.\n\nThe following year, Atlanta mayor Sam Massell tried and failed to do much the same thing in Georgia's capital city. The Justice Department blocked a Houston, Texas, annexation in 1979 that would have added one hundred forty thousand mostly white people to the city's population, diluting the voting power of blacks and Latinos. In North Carolina, Charlotte's boundaries have swollen to the physical size of New York City due to constant annexation over the last several decades.\n\nThe July 18 vote was actually plan B for Mobile's annexation plan.\n\nIn 2019, Stimpson tried to fast-track a \"Grow Mobile\" plan to annex land from unincorporated areas in suburban West Mobile County, where approximately 70 percent residents are white and where voters chose Stimpson over his two black opponents by a nine-to-one ratio.\n\nThe city council voted 4-3 along racial lines in favor of that first annexation plan. Still, a five-vote supermajority was required as part of the Zoghby Act, reconfiguring Mobile's government in 1985 following a civil lawsuit. The US Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division had previously found that Mobile's city commission form of government was discriminatory, with \"smoking gun\" evidence in the form of a 1909 letter written by a white state senator, which explicitly said the post-Reconstruction government was set up because \"we were trying to exclude not the ignorant vote, but the Negro vote.\" Little wonder that no black people had been elected in Mobile's city government from Reconstruction until after the Zoghby Act.\n\nAfter the initial defeat of the 2019 annexation plan, Mobile County sheriff Sam Cochran held a press conference announcing a petition effort to strip the supermajority rule from the city council. The council's three black members condemned the petition as a \"full-out assault on our citizens,\" and it eventually failed.\n\nAs Stimpson pressed for another annexation vote in 2021, Mobile politics turned darkly surreal.\n\nFirst, city council president Levon Manzie, who was black, died a few weeks before the municipal election in November 2021. Almost immediately after Manzie's passing, dark money from a conservative PAC chaired by a man with political ties to Tommy Tuberville, Jeff Sessions, and the Alabama Republican Party flowed into the dead councilman's campaign coffers.\n\nMeanwhile, Stimpson appointed Manzie's mother, Jeanette, to serve on the city council for a month in her deceased son's seat. Two black pastors in Mobile said they believed Jeanette was being used as a pawn to vote for annexation before the election. After Jeanette withdrew a day later, a mysterious campaign started to elect the recently deceased Manzie, with mailers claiming that people should vote for him to honor him.\n\nFormer Mobile mayor Sam Jones, the city's first black mayor, wasn't convinced. \"The attempt was apparently to buy who you wanted into that seat to influence [policy],\" Jones said at the time. But the wild scheme to elect a dead man in order to handpick a candidate favorable to annexation failed after William Carroll, another black candidate, won by just four hundred votes.\n\nCarroll's win and the threats of lawsuits put Stimpson's annexation plan on ice. Shortly after the election, the Southern Poverty Law Center sent the City of Mobile a letter warning they'd sue the city if they found evidence of a \"racial gerrymandering technique\" of \"packing\" and \"cracking\" in the city's redistricting plan, or an annexation plan that \"would serve to dilute the political power of communities of color.\"\n\nMobile's black voters won a victory in August of 2022 when the council voted for a redistricting plan that included majority black council representation for the first time in city history. But thanks to Stimpson, annexation continued to hang over the city like the sword of Damocles.\n\nStimpson's latest annexation plan was finally successful in last Tuesday's special election, with three of four areas voting to enter the City of Mobile. The new voting age demographics have narrowed from 49.7 percent black and 44.4 percent white to 47.5 percent black and 46.1 percent white.\n\nShalela Dowdy, a Mobile native , had won a recent victory as a plaintiff in Allen v. Milligan , in which the Supreme Court ruled in June that the state of Alabama had violated the 1965 Voting Rights Act with a racially gerrymandered congressional district map. But Dowdy sees Mobile's annexation as a setback. \"Throughout the years, there have been obstacles and voter suppression tactics put in our way to prevent us from voting,\" she said . \"Voter suppression continues, but in disguise through the rose-colored glasses of annexation.\"\n\nRyan Zickgraf is a journalist based in Atlanta.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Along with economists like Robert Fogel and Stanley Engerman, he helped pioneer economic modeling techniques to understand the history of American slavery. His books The Political Economy of the Cotton South and Old South, New South: Revolutions in the Southern Economy Since the Civil War are classic studies of the Southern economy's evolution.\n\nRecently, Wright has turned his attention to the twentieth century, examining the economic impact of the mid-century Civil Rights Movement in Sharing the Prize: The Economics of the Civil Rights Revolution in the American South . Though recent history writing has tended to downplay the impact of the Civil Rights Movement in light of continuing racial inequality, Wright's book shows that the rise in black voting following the Voting Rights Act had important consequences for things like black access to public services.\n\nLast month, he released a new paper with the Institute for New Economic Thinking looking at the way Southern politics were reshaped in the decades following the Civil Rights Movement. Taking on the popular idea that the Republican \"Southern Strategy\" of using coded racial appeals led inevitably to GOP dominance in the South, he argues that Southern politics was competitive until 1994, when NAFTA triggered massive deindustrialization, rendering white workers much more receptive to racial scapegoating.\n\nWright recently spoke with Jacobin's Paul Heideman about his research and how progressives can make a play for the ostensibly deep red South. Their conversation has been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nThere's a potted history of Southern politics that goes something like this: you had a one-party South that was ruled by the Democratic Party on the basis of black exclusion, and then the Civil Rights Movement broke that monopoly. The Republican Party saw an opportunity and used coded racial appeals (the \"Southern Strategy\") to replace the Democrats as the default party of the region on the same foundation of racist white votes.\n\nYour paper starts out by assembling quite a bit of evidence that this story misses some of the most interesting dynamics in Southern politics. So what are some of the main things you think are wrong with that kind of standard story?\n\nIt certainly was a radical change and reconstruction of Southern politics in the sixties. One of the quotes most often repeated in this history that you're talking about is what Lyndon B. Johnson (LBJ) supposedly said to Bill Moyers after the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964. Johnson said, \"I think we've given the South to the Republicans for a generation.\"\n\nPeople quote it because it seems to fit so accurately. But that was before the passing of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, which dramatically increased black registration and, really, LBJ was not one to give things away for nothing. So it's pretty clear that they were making a political calculation, that it would be possible to build a biracial coalition that would command a majority in many, if not all, Southern states.\n\nThere was a telephone interview between Martin Luther King Jr and LBJ, and King said, \"Mr. President, look at the states you lost here. You could have won with the black vote.\" So I think that is the way they were thinking. And I think that's largely what happened.\n\nThe elections in 1970 were something of a crossroads in that the outright segregationist appeal was certainly still prominent, but those candidates lost badly that year, and most Southern politicians, who were indeed mainly Democrats at that time, changed their tune. A pretty radical change in rhetoric. Maybe that's only skin deep, but it reflected a change in the voters they were going after.\n\nHow did that shake out politically?\n\nYou had a string of moderate \"New South\" governors from 1970 onward whose pitch was, \"Let's put the race issue behind us. It's settled. Maybe we didn't get what we want, but we have to live with it, and let's get behind a pro-growth platform, which is going to be good for everybody.\"\n\nOne of my favorite figures is the electoral college map, which I put up and say, \"What year is this?\" People rarely get it, because what it shows is most of the South going Democratic and the West Coast going Republican. The answer - which even professional historians take a while to get - is that it's 1976, Jimmy Carter's election year. Jimmy Carter epitomizes one of these new South governors. Yes, moderate by national terms, but progressive on the race issue and clearly leading a coalition in which blacks are a part.\n\nWas that just an anomalous year, a Watergate backlash? Yes, there were elements of that. But I think it's the path that was there to be taken in terms of the biracial coalition in the South.\n\nNow, what I've done is something I don't recommend to anybody: I think I've read every survey by leading political scientists from the seventies through the nineties. These are people on the ground observing things, not just historians trying to make sense of it after the fact. And that's exactly what they were saying in the seventies and eighties and on into the nineties - that things in the South have changed, the race issue is receding.\n\nIn 2020 it might be hard for us to believe that anyone thought that. But these were people who were politically knowledgeable, and their perception was that Southern politics were coming to resemble the rest of the nation in that sense - more based on class, more based on conservative Republicans and Democratic working class, black and white. Of course, that's a casual description, but there was statistical evidence behind it.\n\nYou talk also in your piece about the emergence of black politics in the South, in the wake of the Voting Rights Act in particular, and how that transformed the South. Could you talk about that a little?\n\nThere was a lot of frustration at the slow rate of progress among black voters and black politicians. But black voter registration wasn't slow at all. It was quite dramatic. Translating that into black elected officials took a lot longer.\n\nDon't misread the alternative narrative that I was just giving here about the South rejoining the nation. The white South was certainly pushing back, not so much in the racist rhetoric, but in what is known as vote dilution strategies - changing, for example, from individual member districts to at-large voting. So even though blacks could vote, it was much more difficult for them to actually get their chosen elected official one way or another. There was a lot of litigation over that in the courts.\n\nBut despite Nixon's \"Southern Strategy,\" the truth is that the courts were continuing to enforce the civil rights laws, including the Voting Rights Act. The idea was that voting rights were not just a matter of letting an individual go in and mark a ballot. It had to be effective. It had to be something that could have a meaningful effect on outcome.\n\nThe upshot of that was an increase in black elected officials, with a lag. There's a lot of evidence that it makes a difference, with a couple of new studies showing us that you can identify an effect from black voting on various share in revenues and services for local neighborhoods. This is at the municipal level, county level, and state level.\n\nSo it is not that race consciousness was dropping out or disappearing - that would be a very unrealistic way of reading it. But there was a coalition, and even though the Democratic Party was, as I say, moderate by national standards, what we can see is that being Democrats made a difference and being part of a biracial coalition made a difference. We can see that in dramatic terms, in terms of the kinds of policy shifts that have been implemented when the Republicans did take command of Southern states, as they did in virtually every single one.\n\nOne interesting moment in your paper concerns Strom Thurmond, the ultimate Dixiecrat, and how his approach to the race question had to take account of these new realities. Can you talk a little bit about that?\n\nIn 1970, after supporting a segregationist candidate who lost badly, he changed his tune. He appointed a black assistant. He actually began to compete in his very conservative way for the black vote. He supported black candidates for judgeships.\n\nYou might say he himself was exceptional here, having switched over to the Republicans early, in 1964. Yet at that time, it wasn't entirely clear that the Republican and Democratic parties were going to divide up in the extreme way that they later did. It wasn't clear the Republicans were going to become, essentially an all-white party, not really even pretending to campaign for the black vote and using dog-whistle politics.\n\nSo Strom Thurmond actually wasn't a leader. He was adjusting to the new political reality.\n\nEven as late as the 1980s, there wasn't intense racial polarization between the two parties. You point to 1994 as a key moment where the balance shifted. Why 1994?\n\nYou think of the great turning-point elections in American history. 1860 was about slavery, 1896 was about free silver, 1932 was about the Great Depression. 1994 - what was it?  Yes, it was the year of the Gingrich revolution. He went public with a manifesto and a platform. But that's as much the outcome as an explanation. Almost any year, you could find something dramatic like that.\n\nAnother interpretation that I think has a lot of truth to it is that the Republicans could see they were within striking range of retaking the House, which they had not done since the 1950s. So you had a top-down, heavily financed campaign, which targeted vulnerable representatives and which did a lot of focus group-type research. But you still have to have responsive voters, and these Southern Democratic white working-class voters were pretty well-informed in terms of what they wanted: protection from foreign trade. The big headline issue for 1994 was NAFTA.\n\nThere are very odd elements about this narrative, because NAFTA was a Republican initiative and Clinton came in and had to decide what he might do with it. He decided to support it and these white working-class Democratic voters felt betrayed. They had been sticking with the party, and whatever their politics on race, they were quite willing to be part of a biracial coalition.\n\nSo I think you get two things happening. One was a political reaction. People were following those events carefully, and even before the damage hit, they were retaliating. They were furious, and the anger was taken out on Bill Clinton. All the other basis for hostility to Bill Clinton and his wife came out at that time.\n\nAnother one was the vote to phase out the Multi Fibre Arrangement (MFA), which was a quota system and had kept the American textile industry afloat. That was the same year and if anything, the effects in terms of textile imports were even more dramatic.\n\nSo step one was the political response. Step two was the devastating effect of deindustrialization from both of these measures, so that it was undermining the basis for this biracial coalition. A very good book on this is by Tim Minchin, called Empty Mills .\n\nWe can look back at communities trying to hang on to their factories, and say, look, it was hopeless. There's no way they could have succeeded. But they could have strung it out, and they had succeeded at least in stringing things out for quite a while.\n\nThey made a conscious point of saying, yes we, the textiles industry, used to be segregated, but we've reformed our ways. We now employ large numbers of women and minorities and that's why you should support us. So this was a progressive appeal, and it actually had a fair amount of success until 1994. The Southern labor force was never highly unionized, but it was somewhat unionized, and the unions punched well above their weight in terms of support for measures like this. But they were completely undermined.\n\nOne way to frame it is that these white Southern Democrats were voting their economic interests until 1994, and after that they were voting their emotions. You may say, well, how could they vote for Republicans since NAFTA was a Republican initiative? But they were angry at Bill Clinton, and many of them turned and voted for Ross Perot.\n\nRepublicans were by then tuning into the kind of rhetoric and signals and cultural appeals that have helped define them since. These are somewhat euphemistic terms that were going to appeal to white voters who had been set adrift. Many black workers were also displaced by NAFTA and the MFA and de-industrialization, and they didn't turn Republican, with rare exceptions. So you really have to have a narrative that is subtle enough, nuanced enough, to see both a biracial coalition united by economic interests, and then how it broke down and was replaced by non-economic appeals.\n\nWhat were some of the fruits of Republican dominance of the South after 1994? How did that transform Southern political economy?\n\nIn terms of state policy, some of that came pretty late - the actual takeover of both houses and the governorships. Nationally speaking, the effect came earlier. Take an example like welfare reform . I mean, that was Bill Clinton's signature issue , \"ending welfare as we know it.\" It is perfectly true that what he had had in mind was a much more constructive effort. But what came out of a Republican-dominated Congress was pretty bad.\n\nThe key to it was local control, state control. They weren't quite using the phrase \"state's rights\" in the same aggressive way that the segregationists did. But what they meant and what they carried out was not that different. Actual cash aid was virtually eliminated because the states now had the right to determine policy, and the worst offenders were the Deep South states, which have the largest black population.\n\nSo that would be an example. It's a matter of national legislation opening the door to state decisions.\n\nAnother indicator that I look at, because you can track it over long periods of time, is support for public education. So I look at per-pupil spending in Southern states as a percentage of the national average. The South was way behind in the 1950s and 1960s. But as part of that economic progress, what seemed to be the economic convergence with the rest of the country, there were increases in per-pupil spending, and they were coming right up to the rest of the country.\n\nWhat you see after Republican takeover is a reversal of decades of progress. To some extent, it's a matter of simply the states being starved of revenue. But you also have an active hostility towards public schools. They call them government schools and, in many cases, the South has had the most racially integrated public schools in the nation. Some of this was the retreat from integration by the courts, so that you get this active hostility, often with a color-coded theme to it.\n\nThe notion being (and this is not just the South, we have similar thinking in California), \"public schools are dominated by minorities, and why should we spend our tax money to support them?\" That kind of specter, that fear that integration was going to destroy public schools was there in the sixties, but at the time it didn't happen. You see in the beginning the best of both worlds, both progress toward integration and also progress toward upgrading Southern schools relative to the national average. That has largely come to an end almost everywhere in the South. It's a sad story.\n\nMoving into the present, since 2016, there's been a debate among progressives about whether it's possible to win back white workers. What does your work suggest about what might be necessary to reestablish a large base among these voters in the South?\n\nI'm writing about 1994 partly as a way of saying, don't give up on the South, don't think \"Oh those white southerners, they're hopeless because they're racist and we can't even deal with them.\" No, it was a biracial coalition before and there can be a biracial coalition again that is successful.\n\nI still think the key is to have a program that addresses genuine issues that are faced by working-class or lower income people, black, white and brown, because increasingly it will have to be a multiracial coalition. I think that's the formula, the only defensible formula, that is going to work. I don't think we should give up on anyone, especially not people where there is a valid basis for supporting progressives.\n\nNow we're talking mainly about the South, and we should, but when I look at states that adhere to this kind of scenario - a Republican takeover followed by adverse effects on public policy - Indiana and Wisconsin very much fit the same Southern scenario. I wouldn't want to call that the Southernization, but it's a similar dynamic.\n\nYou get a job displacement. White workers feel they were abandoned by the Democratic Party. And they have good reason to feel that way. No, we can't really reverse the trade policies very much, but we can encourage manufacturing and rural development programs in general. The big cleavage between urban and rural voting patterns is something that can be addressed, and it should be addressed.\n\nYou don't need a majority of disaffected white voters to make it worthwhile, to go after their votes. Cutting into the Trump majority, or the Republican majority, can be the effect that makes a difference. We also see, on this theme of local control or state control, the question of Medicaid expansion. Republican states, primarily the ones in the South, refused to do it, leaving money on the table.\n\nIn quite a number of states, this policy has been reversed by referendums. Yes, the white working class often votes against its own economic interests, but not all the time. Sometimes, if the issue is direct enough and meaningful enough, people will vote on it.\n\nHispanic voters are going to be central moving forward. They are, in a way, the most underrepresented group in the South. The vote suppression tactics that Republicans have been using targets Hispanics almost more than African-Americans, because they vote in such small numbers and they're more susceptible to intimidation tactics.\n\nIt's almost commonplace to say demography is on the side of the Democrats. But it will not just happen automatically, because the resistance is fierce. A lot of this is up for grabs. I am optimistic - or at least optimistic enough to think that it's worth pursuing the struggle.\n\nGavin Wright is an economic historian and the William Robertson Professor of American Economic History emeritus at Stanford University.\n\nPaul Heideman holds a PhD in American studies from Rutgers University-Newark.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

They're an inspiration for single-payer activists today.\n\nMembers of the Medical Committee for Civil Rights at the 1963 March on Washington. National Library of Medicine\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nWhen we tell the story of the American civil rights era, we often leave out a crucial element: the movement for social medicine and community health. Funded by Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty and influenced by innovations in social medicine in South Africa, this new health care movement recognized that good health played an integral role in social equality.\n\nIn 1964, a group of New York doctors organized the Medical Committee for Human Rights (MCHR) to provide first aid to activists in Mississippi during Freedom Summer . Historian John Dittmer writes about the MCHR and its precursor, the Medical Committee for Civil Rights (MCCR), in The Good Doctors: The Medical Committee for Human Rights and the Struggle for Social Justice in Health Care .\n\nThat same year, the Economic Opportunity Act (EOA) provided almost a billion dollars for federal programs aimed at helping the poor. H. Jack Geiger, who participated in the MCHR, managed to direct some of that money to Mound Bayou, Mississippi, a rural community with staggering unemployment, little access to education, and crumbling medical facilities. Thomas J. Ward Jr's new book, Out in the Rural: A Mississippi Health Center and Its War on Poverty , documents the legacy Geiger and his comrades left in this tiny Mississippi town.\n\nTaken together, The Good Doctors and Out in the Rural give contemporary activists a model for reforming our broken health care system. As the movement for \"Medicare for All\" gains momentum in individual states and in Congress, the Left should take inspiration from these activists, who saw that the work of the Civil Rights Movement was not complete without winning access to just and universal health care.\n\nThe MCCR had a short life, but the role it played in developing new health care practices in the United States outweighs its brevity. Physician-activist Walter Lear organized the group in the spring of 1963 to end racial discrimination in the medical profession. When its members protested the American Medical Association's racially discriminatory practices that June, Robert \"Bob\" Smith, from Jackson, Mississippi, was the only black doctor to walk the picket line.\n\nMeanwhile, the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee ( SNCC ) was planning its Freedom Summer. It chose Mississippi, where in 1960 less than 2 percent of the state's black population was registered to vote, the product of a long history of voter suppression, intimidation and organized violence. If they could get out the black vote in Mississippi they could do it anywhere.\n\nIn 1954, just two months after the landmark Brown v. Board of Education decision, white supremacists in Indianola, Mississippi formed the White Citizens' Council; its most prominent member, plantation owner James O. Eastland, also chaired the US Senate's judiciary committee. The WCC received financial support from the state legislature to track and terrorize any Mississippians who supported black voter registration or integration.\n\nIn some areas black residents still lived under curfew. High-profile killings, beginning with Emmett Till in 1955, brought national attention to the region, but many more anonymous victims also died at the hands of white supremacists. Mississippi - especially the Delta - was about as hardcore as it got.\n\nThe plan for Freedom Summer was to register as many black residents as possible. SNCC would bus in an army of middle-class, mostly white student volunteers to help staff the project, which would culminate when the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party challenged Mississippi's all-white delegation at the Democratic National Convention that August.\n\nThe Kennedy administration, reliant on Dixiecrat support, had largely allowed white racists to murder black civil rights workers with impunity. SNCC knew that television cameras would follow the white students, forcing the federal government to enforce the law.\n\nWhen Bob Smith heard that a thousand students were coming to Mississippi, he foresaw a deepening of the ongoing health care crisis in his state. Only fifty black physicians worked in Mississippi in 1964, and many, fearing repercussions, refused to treat civil rights workers. Smith knew the project needed outsiders to treat the \"outside agitators\" (and the inside ones, too).\n\nHe contacted Tom Levin, a psychologist he'd met on the picket line the previous summer, and asked him to round up doctors to go to Mississippi. Dittmer writes that Levin, barely able to contain his enthusiasm, envisioned the doctors as the \"Abraham Lincoln Brigade of the civil rights movement.\"\n\nGeiger was one of the more than one hundred health care professionals who went to Mississippi to support Freedom Summer. All were left-wingers who had worked with the Physicians Forum, organized in 1941 to advance the (still) radical notion that health care is a human right. Most had also worked with Lear's MCCR before it folded.\n\nIf Bob Smith connected the civil rights movement in Mississippi and Old Left physician-activists from the northeast, Jack Geiger built a bridge between that movement and a remarkable experiment in social and community medicine that began in South Africa in 1940.\n\nWhile still in medical school in 1957, Geiger went to South Africa for a clinical clerkship with Sidney and Emily Kark. They had built a health center in Pholela, located in the mostly remote region of what is now KwaZulu-Natal, part of the 13 percent of the country the government set aside for the Africans evicted from their homeland. There, Geiger learned the principles of what would come to be called community-oriented primary care (COPC), which blends clinical practice with environmental health, prevention, and epidemiology.\n\nDuring World War II, the Karks had joined a small cadre of progressive physicians, public health innovators, and government officials committed to delivering health care to black South Africans, many of whom had never seen a Western-trained doctor before.\n\nIn Promoting Community Health: From Pholela to Jerusalem , the Karks describe their enumeration system, which began with defining a community's geographical area, recruiting health workers from that community, and training them to conduct field surveys of water supplies, environmental hygiene, and nutrition.\n\nHealth workers helped residents make vegetable gardens and build privies. They collected household census data that comprised the denominator of the enumeration system. Epidemiologists extracted numerator data from clinical files of those who visited the center and records from school physicals.\n\nThis was where the analytical work - a central feature of the Karkian project - began. The team constantly monitored and evaluated the data as it came in. Social scientists pored over field surveys and vital statistics - live births, stillbirths, infant and maternal mortality, and specific illness rates - to identify changes and estimate probable causes of disease.\n\nMervyn Susser, who did a clinical clerkship with the Karks in 1949, recalled the health center's walls \"plastered with charts\" that illustrated \"over weeks and months, graphs of sentinel health events and trends.\" By merging epidemiology with clinical practice, health teams could anticipate epidemics and devise early interventions. This new health care practice represented a shift away from traditional approaches that emphasize individual health. In the Karks' model, doctors planned for the individual's health as well as that of her family and community.\n\nIn 1944, Dr Henry Gluckman headed a parliamentary commission that pressed for a complete reorganization of South African health care using what he had observed at Pholela. Its recommendations placed South Africa at the forefront of health care in the postwar era. It even anticipated the World Health Organization's mission statement, which declares that health is \"not only absence of disease but a maximum degree of physiological and mental efficiency.\"\n\nThis new understanding of health care required new ways of training doctors. A year after the Gluckman Commission, Sidney Kark's Institute for Family and Community Health at the University of Natal Medical School - the only postsecondary institution for non-white South Africans - started training practitioners, community health workers, and social scientists to work in multidisciplinary teams at the health centers and conduct research in social medicine.\n\nWhen Geiger arrived in South Africa, the racist Afrikaner National Party had been in power for nine years. Between 1945 and 1952, approximately forty-four health centers set up operations, barely 10 percent of what Gluckman had recommended. Most were in dilapidated buildings. The government also passed the Separate University Act, which would dismantle the IFCH.\n\nIn a letter to an American funder, Kark wrote that he and his associates at Natal felt the \"sword of Damocles\" hanging over their heads. While teaching Geiger the principles of social medicine and COPC, Kark knew that his work would continue in the future - but it would have to be in another place.\n\nThe future of COPC began in Mississippi seven years later.\n\nIn August 1964, while the Democratic Party was refusing to seat the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party at its convention, Lyndon Johnson pushed the Economic Opportunity Act (EOA) through a Congress keen to memorialize the recently assassinated John F. Kennedy. The bill committed $947 million for an array of programs, ranging from job training to legal services, that the federal government would directly administer, bypassing local governments.\n\nPredictably, debate over the bill centered on states' rights. Also predictably, the final version included amendments that allowed governors to veto federal funding for any project they disliked.\n\nEven though health care did not appear in the original EOA, securing federal funding to create a health center in the Mississippi Delta was relatively easy. In Community Health Centers: A Movement and the People Who Made it Happen , Bonnie Lefkowitz calls the Office of Economic Opportunity, which implemented the War on Poverty, an \"antibureaucracy.\" Unlike career civil servants, many OEO staffers held temporary positions. They worked quickly, developing new concepts, nurturing projects, and meeting with nontraditional experts, including activists.\n\nGeiger knew Mississippi would never approve federal funding for a health care program targeting poor African Americans. But he saw a loophole. The EOA included grants to institutions of higher education that no southern congressperson had thought to make subject to veto. Geiger exploited this, working with his old MCHR comrade Count Gibson, who chaired the Department of Preventive Medicine at Tufts University Medical School.\n\nNothing in the law said the OEO couldn't give a grant to a university in Massachusetts to support a project in Mississippi. Geiger and Gibson imagined the only objection to this scheme would come from Massachusetts, whose governor might not want a university in his state to funnel money to Mississippi when poor people at home needed health care. So their proposal included one health center at the Columbia Point Housing Project in South Boston and the other in what turned out to be Mound Bayou, Mississippi. When I talked to Geiger in 2011, his eyes danced when he said, \"We reinvented carpet-bagging.\"\n\nLocated deep in the Delta, Mound Bayou was founded in 1887 by Isaiah T. Montgomery, formerly enslaved by Joseph E. Davis, the brother of Confederate president Jefferson Davis. Ward writes that, at the turn of the twentieth century, Mound Bayou \"stood as a beacon of black success in the midst of Jim Crow oppression.\"\n\nIn 1942, the Knights and Daughters of Tabor had opened the Taborian Hospital. A schism in the fraternal order would lead to two smaller hospitals, both funded by membership dues. Sharecroppers and tenant farmers, producing cotton in the Delta's rich alluvial soil, kept the hospitals open.\n\nThis system wasn't sustainable. In the 1950s, competition from synthetic fabric coupled with mechanized cotton harvesters, each capable of doing the work of forty or more people, displaced agricultural workers. Planters now needed barely a fifth of their former workforce. Unemployment ran high. When Geiger arrived in 1965, membership had dropped, and both hospitals had deteriorated. If not for Mississippi's lenient hospital regulations and racial segregation, they would have closed.\n\nGeiger knew that the optics of a northern Jew who arrived with funding from the federal government and a private university in Boston to create a health center in a black town in the Delta was problematic. Even before the project began, he convinced the OEO to fund hospital care on the condition that the two failing hospitals merge into the Mound Bayou Community Hospital.\n\nAfter the merger, the fraternal orders resisted appointing a new board that include representatives from the rural poor: the OEO required \"maximum feasible participation of the residents of the areas and groups served.\" Eventually, the fraternal orders agreed to appoint only one-third of the board of directors, and the rest came from the target population.\n\nMound Bayou's ruling class, deeply resentful of Geiger and the OEO, would be a thorn in the side of the health center for years, often siding with Mississippi's segregationist governor and other white elected leaders, including Senator Eastland.\n\nThe social medicine that Geiger pioneered at the Tufts-Delta Health Center (TDHC) derived from what he had learned in South Africa but was also profoundly shaped by the residents' needs. The center served fourteen thousand people living on five hundred square miles in northern Bolivar County. Median family income sat at just $900 a year. Most residents were functionally illiterate, having attended, on average, four years of school. Many had never seen a physician before. Prenatal care was nonexistent, and the high infant mortality rate - 54.4 deaths per thousand, more than twice that for white infants and 4 percent higher than the national black infant mortality rate - reflected that.\n\nGeiger saw the TDHC as more than a health center. He believed it could become an instrument for community development and social change. He recruited John Hatch, a black community organizer, to get local residents involved in setting health priorities for themselves and their communities.\n\nIn the year before the TDHC opened, Hatch traveled through the tiny hamlets in north Bolivar County soliciting input and helping residents organize ten health associations. These semiautonomous organizations eventually led to the creation of the North Bolivar County Health Council, which coordinated activities and acted as the TDHC's advisory body. Thanks to this community participation, the health center became less concerned with statistics and more committed to improving the social determinants of health: what makes people sick in the first place.\n\nHatch learned that Delta residents were not interested in health care, at least not in the traditional sense. They recognized, perhaps in different terms, that environmental health posed the greatest threat to them. A population cannot be healthy without healthy places to live. Open sewage ran through front yards, and children drank water out of drainage ditches.\n\nTDHC's sanitarian Andrew James found \"sewered white areas and non-sewered black areas,\" revealing that black Delta residents subsidized services for white residents that the former never received.\n\nThe health center's legal department worked with ACLU and NAACP attorneys, who partnered with local residents already working to bring sanitary facilities into their communities. Hawkins v. Shaw [Miss] (1971) set a precedent for other southern cities, holding that the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection clause requires that municipalities equalize public services. Ward writes that the legal and political fights that led to Shaw were an \"extension of the civil rights movement, but for clean water and sanitary communities instead of access to public facilities and the ballot.\"\n\nWhen Hatch visited communities to discuss the health center, he most often heard about hunger. \"Health services are fine,\" said one attendee at an organizational meeting, \"but for the love of God, can you share some food?\"\n\nThe TDHC came up with an ingenious short-term solution: physicians would write prescriptions that could be redeemed at local grocery stores and reimbursed by the TDHC. The governor of Mississippi tried unsuccessfully to stop it. Geiger recalled using the mantra that Sidney Kark taught him years earlier - anything a physician can do to improve a patient's environment is considered fair therapy - to convince the feds to let the health center use its pharmacy budget for food.\n\nThey also created a long-term solution: the North Bolivar Farm Co-operative. If area residents were lukewarm about traditional health interventions, they were wildly enthusiastic about growing vegetables. Eventually, the co-op, owned and operated by area residents, cultivated hundreds of acres of land and ran a wide distribution program. Hatch contracted with a facility nearby to flash freeze vegetables and store them in a food locker for year-round consumption. They also used the food locker to store meat purchased at wholesale prices or from local black farmers and sold to members at cost.\n\nThe co-op slowly expanded its operation to sell used clothing, operate a sandwich shop at the health center, and open an African-American book and record shop in Mound Bayou. Unfortunately, the project never became entirely self-sufficient; when funding contracted under Nixon, Alcorn State University took over the co-op and now runs it as a research farm.\n\nSoon after Geiger and Hatch reinvented health care in Mound Bayou, a brilliant young doctor named Harold Wise secured OEO money to create a neighborhood health center in an impoverished and medically underserved area of the South Bronx.\n\nWith support from the Division of Social Medicine at Montefiore Hospital, Wise's Bathgate Avenue Health Center (rechristened the Martin Luther King, Jr Health Center in 1968) was part of the OEO's second generation of community health centers. Wise's project, influenced by Geiger's work, was also distinctive, a result of the South Bronx's unique demographics (Puerto Rican and African American) and social conditions.\n\nLike his predecessors, Wise recognized that health is predicated on financial security, habitable living, and a healthy environment. He realized early on that providing a defined population geographic access to clinical health care was the easy part; more difficult was what he called \"social accessibility.\" To bridge this gap, he created a new health care para-profession: the Family Health Worker (FHW).\n\nShe - a woman by design - was recruited from the community and trained to perform a variety of functions, from home nursing to complex social casework: everything from forcing landlords to make building repairs to helping residents navigate public assistance.\n\nMultidisciplinary health teams could not function without the FHW, and she became the critical link between the health center and its target population. She spoke the language of the residents and served as their advocate \"against a variety of establishments, including the medical establishment.\" She explained health care hierarchies in the barrio, which included both pharmacists and botanicas, and physicians were required to defer to her.\n\nHealth care, said Wise, sounding a bit like John Hatch, could not \"originate [from] outside a community and then be served up . . . as a 'fait accompli.'\"\n\nSadly, these innovations were short-lived. Nixon transferred the OEO to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, where it began funding traditional clinical health services. In 1972, the department merged the TDHC and Mound Bayou Hospital. This time, the hospital got to choose its own board of directors, and it selected only members of the local elite.\n\nThe merger allowed Nixon to score points with two constituencies: those who demanded community control for African Americans and the white voters he'd won over to the Republican Party with his \"Southern strategy.\" Because the merger cut the health center's academic affiliation, it closed the loophole that prevented governors' vetoes.\n\nIn 2014 the Delta Health Center dedicated a new building on its campus: the Dr. H. Jack Geiger Medical Center. This well-deserved honor is not without cruel irony. The community-oriented primary care that Geiger introduced in Mississippi in the mid-1960s has long been forgotten. The medical center named for the great pioneer in public health and social medicine during the civil rights era now dispenses traditional medical care.\n\nToday the MLK Center in the South Bronx and the Geiger Medical Center in the Delta are two of more than twelve hundred health centers scattered around the United States in rural and urban areas that provide traditional preventive and curative medical services to the poor. When the OEO began funding health care in 1965, federal restrictions limited services to the poor, assuring a two-tier health care system. A system created only for the poor can be more readily dismantled than one created for all Americans.\n\nIn 2012, when the Supreme Court's ruling on Obamacare said that states were not required to expand Medicaid, many liberals regarded the decision as a victory because it also upheld the individual mandate: the cornerstone of our health care system that is organized around for-profit insurance companies.\n\nThis winter, Republican efforts to dismantle Obamacare drew crowds to town halls; many indignant attendees and protesters saw the next step as providing insurance for all, not reversing the Affordable Care Act's limited gains. They recognize what the Karks, Geiger, and Wise knew: the only way to protect us all is to create a universal medical system, with no socioeconomic tiers.\n\nBernie Sanders calls this Medicare for All .

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nNew Labor Forum 's (NLF) first issue appeared in 1997, but its birth pangs - labor pains if you will - began two years earlier.\n\nIn 1995, the American labor movement underwent a rare change in leadership, as the \" New Voice \" slate took charge of the AFL-CIO. To many at the time, it seemed to signal something more important and far-reaching than a routine changing of the guard.\n\nI remember writing a letter , along with my friend and labor historian Nelson Lichtenstein , to the New York Review of Books welcoming this unexpected upheaval at the top because we thought it might refresh not only a weakened labor movement then in deep retreat but also inspire hope that such a revitalized labor movement might bring back broader movements for social justice and equality. A variety of intellectual and political luminaries, including such unlikely brothers as Arthur Schlesinger Jr and Noam Chomsky, cosigned the letter, illustrating the breadth of hope excited by John Sweeney's election.\n\nTwenty years on, very, very few of those hopes have been realized. A wise friend once told me that there are really only two questions in the world: What's the problem, and who do you blame? The left-progressive world mastered this approach to life long, long ago, but I'd like to try and avoid it.\n\nIt might be more useful to remember the context in which Sweeney was elected, Nelson and I wrote our letter, and the Joseph S. Murphy Institute at the CUNY Graduate Center came up with the idea of publishing a journal. Was the tide running in or out on our cherished hopes for reform and rebirth?\n\nBy the mid-1990s, the notion that the country was experiencing a second Gilded Age had become a journalistic commonplace. Tycoons were lionized, and business as the essential business of America - to coin or paraphrase something President Calvin Coolidge penned back in the Jazz Age - had once again become an article of faith. We were a country of \"winners\" and \"losers\" and proud of it.\n\nGalloping rates of income and wealth inequality weren't invisible so much as they were duly recorded in government reports and news stories and then ignored. The nation's social conscience was at a low ebb.\n\nThis social unconsciousness infected both political parties. Under Bill Clinton, neoliberalism had replaced New Deal liberalism, becoming a bipartisan persuasion. Acquiescence to this state of affairs could be detected everywhere, including in the labor movement, which had been on the defensive for years.\n\nNeoliberalism was, of course, more than an ideology; it was also a material assault. It deindustrialized the nation while empowering the financial sector. It gutted whole regions and ways of life. It transgressed, undermined, and even retrofitted legal protections to serve the corporation. The heartland of twentieth-century trade unionism, where a mobilized industrial working class had once wielded real power, grew anemic. These became lands of dispossession, with unions just barely clinging to life.\n\nThe new economic order opened up fresh territory for predatory exploitation. These were zones of precarious labor, vulnerable, unmonitored - essentially defenseless and fatally fragmented.\n\nThe labor force itself changed color and gender and immigration status. These were workers with little or no experience with a labor movement, which in turn had done its own part to keep them outside the perimeter of the protected.\n\nFinancial domination of the country's economy also penetrated markets and work sites abroad. Jobs migrated to the Global South and elsewhere. With that, the tensile strength of the American labor movement grew weaker, its institutions easier and easier to intimidate.\n\nAll of this and more conspired against achieving the hopes invested in the Sweeney election and in the founding of a journal like New Labor Forum .\n\nToday we are accustomed to thinking of the organized labor movement as perilously close to extinction. Even twenty years ago it was on everybody's mind. But there is a telling difference in kind between being endangered and being nearly extinct. In 1997 it was still possible to imagine the institutionalized trade union movement as a vehicle of social transformation. How ambitious!\n\nBut what were those ambitions more precisely?\n\nMass organizing of the unorganized probably topped the agenda. Instead of focusing on salvaging what was fast disappearing, unions would venture where they had either long since ceased going or never gone at all. In the process, it would add muscle to defending what they still had.\n\nIn turn that would mean venturing into newer sectors and regions of the economy. Some were not so much new as new to trade unionism, like the service industries . Others represented innovations in the technical division of labor, like telecommunications , and some had long been terra incognito except for a few redoubts here and there, like the South.\n\nVictories in mass organizing could and would, by virtue of sheer numbers, stop neoliberal anti-unionism in its tracks. So it was foretold.\n\nThe labor movement couldn't hope for such triumphs without challenging and overturning longstanding racial, ethnic, and gender barriers and hierarchies both at the leadership level and further down the ranks; after all, the new labor force, and in particular, growing percentages of the unionized workforce, were people of color and women. This anticipated breakthrough could be internally lifesaving.\n\nIt might also build connections to the outside world. Alliances with people-of-color, immigrant, and women's organizations might now become more than mere pious wishes. This was the long-sought-after holy grail: a trade union movement transformed into a social movement.\n\nPeople, in and outside of the labor movement, who sensed these possibilities could reasonably look forward to a time when the \"labor question,\" newly enriched by its imbrication with other movements for social justice, could interrogate and stand up to the second Gilded Age as it once had the first.\n\nThese desires and expectations, at least the primary ones, gave rise first of all to a little organization I was briefly involved with - Scholars, Artists, and Writers for Social Justice (SAWSJ), which sponsored a widely reported teach-in with the new labor movement at Columbia University. Soon after - and this is perhaps the only lasting legacy of SAWSJ - came New Labor Forum , which I'm both happy and chagrined to report lasted a lot longer than SAWSJ.\n\nWith some simplification, you could say that SAWSJ operated from the outside in and New Labor Forum from the inside out. SAWSJ attempted to create the kind of satellite organizations of intellectuals and artists that had orbited around and in support of the labor movement in the 1930s and '40s. In contrast, NLF , because of its extensive ties to the existing trade union world, emphasized those behaviors and policies that might help reorient the labor movement in the direction Sweeney's election promised.\n\nBut that was by no means the sole subject of its attention in those opening years. Indeed, the journal hoped to reach a much broader audience not only outside the trade union movement but even outside the narrow precincts where labor-left intellectuals typically gathered. Detectable here too was a harkening back to the labor movement's golden era during the New Deal.\n\nFor both SAWSJ and NLF , these hopes were simultaneously grand and circumscribed by a horizon established long ago. The next twenty years would turn out to be a long course in lost illusions.\n\nPerhaps the most painful and poignant realization was that the trade union movement could not bear the load. It was inherently incapable, all by itself, of functioning as the vessel of broader social transformation.\n\nHere the past haunted and disabled the present. The CIO in its heyday was the de facto model for the future, a view that overlooked the political atmosphere of the 1930s that had allowed an insurgent labor movement to perform great feats outside of its accustomed zone of activity.\n\nSpecifically, the Democratic Party of Clinton was worlds removed from the party of Roosevelt. The New Deal party was in a molten state, open to all sorts of social pressures from the outside, even from the invisibles of the industrial heartland. The party of the Democratic Leadership Council had long since closed itself off to such pressures. It had become a fixed entity, frozen in place by the new political economy of finance-driven deindustrialization and casual labor.\n\nUnlike elsewhere in the West, the American labor movement had never - with some momentary exceptions - given birth to a political correlate that could articulate broader anticapitalist ambitions. The party of the New Deal had been a substitute for that, albeit a malformed one full of contradictions. In any event, by 1995 it was dead, and that death had removed the vital understructure that had helped transform a trade union movement into a social movement.\n\nBut both the labor cadre and the flotsam and jetsam of a dissociated left - of which I consider myself a typical piece of flotsam - had, reluctantly or not, become enmeshed in the politics of the lesser evil, notwithstanding airy propositions about third parties, labor parties , and socialist parties that got floated now and then. This entrapment was not so much morally corrupt in its origins (though it could be) but mainly a form of resignation and acquiescence.\n\nIt was also a failure of imagination, to not acknowledge that the New Deal was over, not to be resurrected but transcended. Easy for me to levy that indictment, but name someone who escapes it. The New Deal exists to this day in some sense as the velvet prison of thwarted desire.\n\nInside that prison salutary memories of a muscular and masculine labor movement lived on even as the labor force, both unionized and unorganized showed a different profile. I don't mean that the established labor leadership was chauvinist or nativist or merely locked into perpetuating its own kind. That's a fairly standard accusation and contains more than a grain of truth. Instead, I'm thinking of the labor movement's aesthetics.\n\nWhat I mean is its form, crafted to coincide with the architecture of industrial capitalism. However much the new postindustrial economy decentered labor, the model of the factory and the form of labor organization that had been congruent with that massing of workers continued to prevail as a model. It was inherently masculine insofar as the romance of labor had, in the main, endowed the movement with a mighty bicep congruent with the gargantuan machinery, the fiery furnaces, and all-sided heavy-lifting amid which industrial work was embedded.\n\nThis memorialized labor movement was becoming an anachronism, a form whose content was withering away when measured against the emerging world of flexible, fragmented, subcontracted , temporary, free-agent work characteristic of new economic order. That was more than a disillusioning experience; it was a puzzle with no obvious solution. It left both labor organizers and their fellow travelers among the intellectual flotsam and jetsam at sea.\n\nAggravating this sense of disorientation was the experience of political abandonment, which the new labor leadership probably felt most acutely. The movement's political practice had for a long time consisted of shoring up relations with a ghost - namely, the so-called progressive wing of the Democratic Party, which by the mid-1990s could not even pass muster as a saving remnant.\n\nStill, what else to do? Lacking confidence - and for good reason - that the labor movement could rely on its own dwindling resources to rebirth itself, leaders sent lifelines out to the party elite and invested herculean efforts and precious resources on its behalf. Not much came back, and it was bitter to realize how little a once mighty institution mattered to a party the labor movement once considered its own. What to do preoccupied many, filled the pages of the New Labor Forum , and unsettled those hopes of a new day.\n\nWhat about that most elusive, tormenting, and vital aspiration of all aspirations - black and white unite and fight - that the Sweeney victory seemed positioned to realize?\n\nOne tried and true way of answering this question is to point to the racial prejudices that had for generations pockmarked the labor movement and still did. A slightly subtler version of this critique held that labor leaders and white radicals tended to subordinate or even efface the needs and demands of their black coalition partners. This observation is chronic because it's true, but it's worth considering the dilemma from another angle as well.\n\nOn the one hand, a growing proportion of the active labor movement consisted of African Americans and other people of color. Sweeney's own union was a case in point. Moreover, these segments of the labor movement tended to display a fighting spirit and a greater openness to calls for social justice. Here the \"labor question\" might still be addressed head on.\n\nBut this was not so much the case elsewhere in the black community. There, a newly risen black middle class, empowered by civil rights legislation and the war on poverty, dominated African-American organizational and political life alongside the black clergy.\n\nIn these circles, the \"labor question\" appeared lower on the agenda, if at all. (There were important exceptions, as for example the NAACP under Julian Bond, who warmly welcomed the emergence of SAWSJ).\n\nSuspicions about the real intentions of the new and still disproportionately white labor leadership were certainly reasonable. But the African-American political class and the array of civil rights and community organizations could use this distrust as an excuse to avoid matters that might spill over into class conflict.\n\nThis is not to accuse these circles of political cowardice but rather of adopting a position and pursuing objectives that ran at right angles to the \"labor question\" - which is to say in the direction of furthering the cause of individual as opposed to collective rights and powers.\n\nThe dream of building coalitions between a revitalized labor movement - cleansed at least partially of its greatest sin - and the world of civil rights and black liberation fighters was further curtailed from the outset by a kind of historical disinterest on the part of the latter.\n\nThe consequences ran deeper than that. They were evident in the recent electoral cycle. While segments of the white working class oscillated between Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump, all but the youngest African Americans lined up behind Hillary Clinton, especially in the South.\n\nThis happened despite the fact that the Democratic Party had done little to improve and much to further the deterioration of everyday life for black Americans. Here that same entrenched black political class, conditioned by the experience of the last half-century, paid dividends for the Clintons.\n\nThis history also hurt the Sanders campaign's ability to achieve some of the same heightened expectations for social justice aroused twenty years earlier. Some blame him for neglecting distinctly black needs and desires. This is clearly true to some extent, but how much so is debatable.\n\nMore important, however, the labor and allied political activists who participated in and celebrated the 1995 palace upheaval rarely deal with the capturing of the black vote by political elites who do not have their best interests at heart.\n\nThis truism is largely verboten territory. The established black political class would surely resist it. Further, to confront it would spoil the romantic illusion of a homogeneous and progressive-minded black America that has inherently virtuous political instincts.\n\nRace guilt feeds this fear of offense in some measure, but the labor movement also fears forfeiting relations with the African American organizational milieu even though its leaders remain by and large uninterested in cultivating coalitions with the labor movement.\n\nSo long as most black voters can reliably be counted on to invest their fate in the neoliberal wing of the Democratic Party - tutored in that preference by their own religious and political leadership class - the prospects for a cross-race labor and left alliance will remain distant.\n\nOf course, a majority of the labor movement also climbed aboard the Clinton train as it headed for the cliff. However, there was and is a substantial and growing Sanders wing of the labor movement . This remarkable development has unleashed a force that is exercising significant power in a party once again in at least a semi-molten state. Something like that hasn't even been dreamed of since the days of Bayard Rustin.\n\nIf the same organized divisions were to appear within the realm of African American politics, the I-have-a-dream moment of 1995 might have real legs. At the very least, we in the labor movement must attend to the internal social and political divisions within the African American and immigrant communities if we want to escape the prison of consoling delusions.\n\nTragic beyond measure was how the labor movement hemorrhaged at its core, even before Sweeney stepped on stage. Its position as the collective bargaining agent of a largely white, industrial working class had been deteriorating for decades. Whatever responsibility the labor leadership bore for this fatal turn of events, is, in my mind, overshadowed by the nearly irresistible tides of deindustrialization and the fundamental shift in the balance of class power since the 1970s.\n\nWhat could be counted on, until recently at least, was a certain political loyalty among workers to the remains of New Deal liberalism, at least during biannual electoral cycles. This was emphatically the case among the organized white working class, increasingly less so among the de-organized or the never organized.\n\nThat is no longer the case; among the most stunning results of the 2016 election was the fact that in strategic precincts throughout the industrial core more white workers voted for Obama - and did so twice - than pulled the lever for Clinton. One could be justified in seeing this as frightening or promising or both. No matter what, it represented the heavy price of abandonment. In these territories of dispossession, the politics of broad-brush resentment and revenge festered; so too did the politics of identity - particularly white identity. Trump harvested those social emotions.\n\nThat these same quarters expressed sympathy for Sanders suggests that they might have been pulled in a different direction had the labor movement managed to cultivate its roots in these devastated regions. In any event, the hopes of 1995 went there to die.\n\nIs this salvage time? In the face of what's befallen the country, hunkering down, holding on to what still exists by way of combat organizations, probing deeper into the whys and wherefores of what has transpired may well be the order of the day.\n\nBut events are outpacing anyone's imagination, so the answer is profoundly unclear. What seems most forbidding now may suddenly rotate 180 degrees. Hopefully left movements won't squander these opportunities as they did twenty years ago.\n\nSteve Fraser is the author most recently of Mongrel Firebugs and Men of Property: Capitalism and Class Conflict in American History and a forthcoming book of essays from Verso on capitalism and class in American history.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

      "text": "Bernie Sanders Lost the Black Vote. That's Probably a Problem Going Forward.\n\nBernie Sanders speaks during a campaign event in Spartanburg, South Carolina, on Thursday, February 27. Matt Rourke/AP\n\nIn the ballroom of a convention center in Columbia, South Carolina, Bernie Sanders campaign co-chair Nina Turner stared out at the crowd of supporters that had gathered for what they'd hoped would be another victory party. The group was much smaller than the ones who'd flocked to see her and Sanders throughout South Carolina that week, but it did share one key characteristic with its predecessors: It was mostly white.\n\nAnd that was precisely the problem for the Sanders campaign in a state where two-thirds of the primary electorate is Black.\n\nFormer vice president Joe Biden didn't just win South Carolina-early results show he swept every county and nabbed nearly half of all votes cast. Exit polls suggest Biden had support from 61 percent of Black voters, compared to Sanders' paltry 17 percent. Turner, who had been the lifeblood of Sanders' outreach , told supporters in the ballroom that Sanders, according to early internal numbers, had won voters under 44 years old, young Black voters by 40 percent, and first-time voters by 30 percent. But the reality was clear: Sanders had barely beaten his 2016 showing in the Palmetto State, when Hillary Clinton crushed Sanders.\n\nIt surely wasn't what the campaign had envisioned. After victories in New Hampshire and Nevada and winning the popular vote in Iowa, Sanders had been bullish about his South Carolina prospects. He entered the early contests telling supporters he would do \"better than they thought\" in South Carolina; in recent weeks, he began saying he might win.\n\nThere were signs that Sanders optimism hadn't been unfounded. While polls of the state had Biden with a massive lead over the rest of the field for much of the 2020 campaign, Sanders caught up to him after his early victories. All week, national media had been touting Sanders' efforts to court the state's Black voters-particularly younger Black voters, who had shown a preference for Sanders' liberal stances and record on fighting for civil rights. All across the state, I encountered voters who suggested the strategy might be working. Melinda Williams, who canvassed for Sanders in the poor black neighborhoods of Sumter, told me she'd converted some Biden voters to Sanders after explaining that Sanders had attended Martin Luther King's 1963 March on Washington and supported Jesse Jackson's 1988 racial justice and poverty-centered run for president. Tracie Blue sat through a 45-minute roundtable that Pete Buttigieg held with Black community leaders in Greenville on Thursday, before telling me she was thinking about voting for Sanders. \"He's been in the trenches,\" she said. \"He has been fighting for us and our rights as a people for a very long time.\"\n\nFour years ago, Sanders had been criticized by Black Lives Matter protestors who scoffed at Sanders for failing to explicitly recognize the racial injustice at the base of economic inequality facing Black Americans. This time around, he seems to have taken their concerns seriously. During his last run for the White House, Sanders rejected the idea of reparations for descendants of the formerly enslaved as too unrealistic and politically divisive; this cycle, he's embraced legislation to study and develop a reparations proposal. His economic justice plans have been strengthened with a racial justice lens, such as his proposal to boost marijuana businesses led by minority entrepreneurs-and he's done so in consultation with scholars who have pioneered the study of the racial wealth gap. The class-centric rhetoric remains in his stump speeches, but he talks about race more than he used to-and a deep bench of new and returning Black surrogates bridge that gap when Sanders fails to.\n\n\"'Soviet,' 'communist,' 'Bolshevik,'-that's what they said about my brother, Martin Luther King, Jr,\" the scholar and activist Cornel West told a crowd in Columbia last Saturday to assuage fears that a democratic socialist label would harm Sanders in a general election.\n\nWhat holds Sanders back from toppling Biden altogether? Older voters-who are also the likeliest voters-are a piece of it , a problem that persists from this 2016 run. Clay Middleton, who worked for both Obama and Clinton in South Carolina and served as a senior adviser to Cory Booker's campaign, blames Sanders' unpopularity among them on a lack of retail politics. When Sanders visited the Palmetto State, he favored large format rallies and town halls over intimate gatherings; an analysis from the Charleston-based Post and Courier lists just about a dozen roundtables and meet-and-greets over the 41 campaign stops he's made over the last two years. \"I think older people feel like Bernie is yelling at them,\" Middleton says. \"Because he does not do any retail politics, older folks doesn't feel like he comes across as a warm person.\"\n\nAnother factor might be the derision Sanders has faced from establishment African American political leaders in the state. On Wednesday morning, James Clyburn, the influential black congressman considered the state's Democratic kingmaker, endorsed Biden. Preliminary exit polls suggest at least half of South Carolina voters say Clyburn's endorsement influenced their vote.\n\nNational polling suggests Sanders is doing better with Black voters than his outcome in South Carolina might suggest. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll from mid-February showed Sanders gaining ground, about equal to Biden in terms of Black voters. A Hill/HarrisX poll conducted the week before South Carolina found that Sanders surpassed Biden nationally in Black support.\n\nStill, Saturday's results could be a problem for a campaign staring down several Southern states on Super Tuesday, where candidates will similarly face a majority-Black Democratic electorate.\n\nState Rep. Justin Bamberg, a Sanders supporter, thinks the South mentality is one less inclined to accept Sanders' calls for radical change. Old black voters in particular, he says, distrust the federal government, a belief that runs counter to Sanders' promises of overhauling it. And the faith in reliable, trustworthy institutions like Rep. Clyburn poses an obstacle to turning the tide in Sanders' favor. Bamberg tells me the counter is to remind folks that the federal government has served Black South Carolinians well-and that's true more than ever in a state where states' rights have been ruinous for women who want control over their bodies and workers who want to organize .\n\n\"It's difficult to maintain an open mind, particularly in the South,\" Bamberg says, noting how schools, churches, and community spaces remain segregated decades after the Civil Rights Act's passage. \"Its foundation is built on resisting change-and that shit's gotta stop.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "How a Three-Word Phrase Sabotaged Black Voting Rights, and How They Can Be Reconstructed\n\nRicardo Santos\n\nPema Levy March+April 2021 Issue\n\nIn 1866 , an Army officer named Robert Avery was stationed in North Carolina when he began hearing disturbing reports: Former rebels were rounding up as many Black men as they could find, dispensing summary justice, and whipping them in public view. Avery, an agent of the Freedmen's Bureau there, alerted his superiors in Washington. The press got hold of his dispatch and began to chronicle the situation. Harper's Weekly told of 500 people in Raleigh gathering to watch \"the public whipping of colored men.\"\n\nThe whippings were about more than bloodlust. They served a political purpose. Under North Carolina law, a crime punished by public whipping would cost the offender the right to vote. The white rebels plotted to \"seize negroes, procure convictions for petty offenses punishable at the whipping post, and thus disqualify them forever from voting in North Carolina,\" Avery reported. He had overheard members of the state legislature celebrating that it would \"head off Congress from making the negroes voters.\" One had bragged, \"We are licking them in our part of the State and if we keep on we can lick them all by next year, and none of them can vote.\"\n\nJust a few months earlier, Congress had passed the 14th Amendment and sent it to the states for ratification. In the second section of the amendment, the antislavery Republicans sought to enfranchise the freed men in the South. But rather than affirmatively extend the franchise, they devised a way to punish states that did not allow Black men to vote: Should a state disenfranchise its Black men, its congressional delegation would be reduced in proportion to the number of those excluded from the vote. But the architects of this approach left a loophole: States would not see their delegations reduced for citizens disenfranchised \"for participation in rebellion, or other crime .\" In North Carolina, white supremacists decided to turn every Black man they could into a convict, taking away his right to vote while preserving their power in Congress.\n\nOr other crime . Three small words that continue to shape America today. It is a great irony of our history that the 14th Amendment, which enshrined in the Constitution the promise of equal protection under the law, is today the principal source of Black disenfranchisement. But there's no reason to accept this fate. At a time when the public is increasingly aware of modern attempts at suppression, the tools for resurrecting the fundamental right to vote are waiting to be put to use. Our future could depend on how seriously we decide to take the rest of the words in Section 2.\n\nThe white supremacists in North Carolina had figured out something important: The 14th Amendment was a weapon that could be turned against itself if Congress and the courts did not intervene. And that's precisely what happened throughout the South. Black criminality was constructed to fit the needs of the prevailing racial order. Freed from federal oversight after Reconstruction, most Southern states by the 1900s had rewritten their constitutions to deny Black people the vote through nominally race-blind provisions, including expanded criminal disenfranchisement. These measures, alongside poll taxes, literacy tests, grandfather clauses, fraud, registration restrictions, and vigilante violence, were part of the toolkit used by white supremacists to maintain a system of racial subordination. Felon disenfranchisement was not strictly a regional phenomenon-more than 80 percent of states had felon disenfranchisement laws on the books by the end of the 19th century-but the South became its epicenter after Reconstruction, continuing into the age of mass incarceration.\n\nThe rest of Section 2 was more or less ignored. Congress never invoked its penalty, and instead turned a blind eye to the mass disenfranchisement that more deeply entrenched white supremacy. The curtailment of Black voting rights inflated the white supremacists' power in Washington. Political scientist Richard Valelly estimates that it gave white Southerners an extra 25 seats in the US House in the first half of the 20th century. Black disenfranchisement effectively created a one-party system in the South that gave seniority to Jim Crow lawmakers in Congress, placing them atop powerful committees where they stymied economic opportunities for Black people, most significantly in the New Deal. Failure to enforce the penalty, Valelly argues, contributed to the election of Woodrow Wilson in 1912. An unrepentant racist, Wilson oversaw the segregation of the civil service, effectively federalizing Jim Crow, and the transformation of the District of Columbia into a stratified Southern-style capital. It's impossible to imagine how else our history might have unfolded had Black interests been allowed a voice in the federal government.\n\nChain gang, 1903.\n\nPhoto 12/Universal Images Group/Getty\n\nIn 1965, the Voting Rights Act did what Congress had failed to do with Section 2 by finally protecting Black Southerners' right to vote. During its second Reconstruction, the nation banned poll taxes and literacy tests, and began blocking myriad local voting restrictions. Voting, Congress and the Supreme Court declared in a series of landmark laws and decisions, was a fundamental right. But like some sort of tragic flaw, the ambivalence built into Section 2 would continue to shape the plot of American history.\n\nIn 1974, the Supreme Court, now in conservative hands, ruled that Section 2 allowed states to disenfranchise ex-offenders permanently. The opinion was both a product and producer of the era of racial retrenchment that worked to beat back the gains of the '60s. This was the dawn of mass incarceration. Within decades, millions of Black Americans had been incarcerated and stripped of the right to vote, some for the duration of their sentences, many for the rest of their lives. In addition to warping local politics, this mass disenfranchisement had profound national effects. In 2000, George W. Bush was elected by 537 votes in the state of Florida, a state that had permanently banned an estimated 827,000 people at that time from voting, a disproportionate number of them Black. In 2016, Hillary Clinton lost the state by about 113,000 votes, while nearly 1.5 million Floridians were disenfranchised-including 21.4 percent of eligible Black voters, according to estimates from the Sentencing Project . Again and again the history of the country has turned on those three forgotten words in the Constitution.\n\n﻿ ﻿\n\nIn 2020, despite Florida voters having passed in 2018 a constitutional amendment to end permanent disenfranchisement for most crimes, the state continued to disenfranchise nearly 900,000 formerly incarcerated individuals. It did this by demanding they first pay off fines and fees associated with their convictions, what voting rights advocates called a modern-­day poll tax. Across the country but concentrated in the South, 5.17 million people remain disenfranchised for a felony conviction, including 1 in 16 eligible Black voters-nearly four times the rate for the non-Black population. Eleven states disenfranchise at least 10 percent of their Black populations. In Tennessee, it's 21 percent. Section 2 was designed to combat racial disenfranchisement. Instead, it is used to justify the greatest voter suppression scheme in modern times.\n\nNone of this had to happen. The country made the choice to allow Section 2 to be used for evil. The roots of this decision are important, not least because they demonstrate that some pragmatic compromises made in the name of unity have a way of bringing about radical injustices. After the Civil War, the 13th Amendment ended slavery. It also created an immediate problem for the Republican Party, then the antislavery party of the North. Before the war, the Constitution had counted slaves as three-fifths of a person for apportioning congressional delegations, giving slave states extra representation (another disastrous compromise). Now, every person counted equally. By withholding the franchise from former male slaves, the South, buoyed by their number but unencumbered by their votes, was poised to return to the Union even more powerful than before.\n\nThe obvious solution was to enfranchise Black men, and Radical Republicans-who believed in racial equality and wanted to punish the rebels-fought for this. But moderate Republicans balked, fearing backlash from white constituents who had no interest in expanding the Black vote. Additionally, most Northern states had also disenfranchised their Black populations, and lawmakers didn't want to change the rules in their own backyards.\n\nSo Section 2 was a compromise to address the immediate problem of Southern representation. The Radical Republicans voted for it while lamenting it as a betrayal. \"It was a scheme of cold-blooded treachery and ingratitude to a people who had contributed nearly two hundred thousand soldiers to the armies of the Union,\" George Julian, a Radical Republican representative from Indiana, recalled in his memoirs. \"To recognize the authority of these states to make political outlaws of their colored citizens and incorporate this principle into the Constitution of the United States, was a wanton betrayal of justice and humanity.\" Julian preferred an amendment that would affirmatively extend the right to vote to Black Americans and, far ahead of his time, to women. On the first of these, his colleagues would quickly come around.\n\nSome Radical Republicans also predicted Section 2's practical deficiencies. After the passage of the 13th Amendment ending \"involuntary servitude\" except when convicted of a crime, the rebel states had quickly erected Black Codes to criminalize the former slave population and put them back into bondage on plantations through what became the convict-leasing system-a loophole that persists to this day in the widespread practice of prison labor. In January 1866, Illinois Rep. John Farnsworth warned that the rebels may pull the same trick again when it came to voting: \"They may provide that no man shall exercise the elective franchise who has been guilty of a crime and then they may denounce these men as guilty of a crime for every little, imaginary, petty offense.\" But many of his colleagues ignored this warning.\n\nFelon disenfranchisement had a long history going back to English common law. \"Disenfranchising for crime was incredibly common back then,\" says Pippa Holloway, a history professor at the University of Richmond and the author of Living in Infamy: Felon Disfranchisement and the History of American Citizenship . Those convicted of serious offenses were considered unworthy of the right to vote-a view of suffrage eagerly taken up on this side of the Atlantic. But \"the people convicted of serious crimes in the 1860s, 1870s, and 1880s were a really small number of people.\" As North Carolina's whipping scheme revealed, the framers of Section 2 had underestimated the South's dedication to white supremacy. The list of felonies in Southern states quickly expanded in response to Section 2, and countless people have lost the right to vote for offenses that the states had once reckoned trivial. Florida, still the state with the highest number of disenfranchised felons, illustrates this sea change. In 1866, the state established county criminal courts with jurisdiction over \"larceny...malicious mischief, vagrancy, and all misdemeanors,\" and \"all offences against Religion, Chastity, Morality, and Decency,\" targeted at Black citizens. Two years later, it established that all felonies and \"infamous crimes\" would lead to disenfranchisement, again with the aim of stripping the newly freed slaves of their voting rights. Florida's prison population immediately soared, almost tripling from 1880 to 1890.\n\nA chain gang at Limestone Correctional Facility in Harvest, Alabama.\n\nAndrew Holbrooke/Corbis/Getty\n\nThe 14th Amendment had scarcely passed to the states for ratification in June 1866 when Congress realized its insufficiency. After Abraham Lincoln's assassination, President Andrew Johnson began to show his true colors as a racist bent on undercutting the project of Reconstruction. He installed all-white governments in the former Confederate states, which created a new system of bondage for the freed slaves. These Johnson governments, dedicated to white supremacy, rejected the 14th Amendment, and Johnson offered $20,000 of his own money to the campaign against it. Within months of its passage, most Republicans realized that Section 2 would not entice the Confederate states to let freed men vote. They began to favor what had been unthinkable just a few months before: the required enfranchisement of Black men.\n\n\"It was rebel desperation which saved the negro,\" Julian wrote, recalling the change in sentiment toward Section 2 in December 1866, \"for if the xiv Amendment had been at first accepted, the work of reconstruction would have ended without conferring upon him the ballot.\" Three months later, in March 1867, a Republican-­dominated Congress passed the Military Reconstruction Act, paving the way for the replacement of white supremacist regimes with biracial governments elected by white and Black men. At least 800,000 freed men gained the right to vote. The act also attempted to tamp down on the practice of disenfranchising Black men for petty offenses, stipulating that the franchise could be removed only for crimes viewed historically as serious-\"for participation in the rebellion or for felony at common law .\"\n\nThe readmission acts that subsequently allowed rebel states back into the Union by 1870 again stipulated that felon disenfranchisement was intended to be a narrow exception: \"except as a punishment for such crimes as are now felonies at common law, whereof they shall have been duly convicted, under laws equally applicable to all of the inhabitants of said state .\"\n\nIn 1869, just three years after refusing to affirmatively force Black suffrage on the states, Congress did just that, passing the 15th Amendment. \"This is a period when people's ideas are in rapid flux,\" says Eric Foner, a preeminent historian of Reconstruction. \"People who, at the time of the 14th Amendment, said we cannot tell the states what to do about voting, two or three years later have changed their mind and they're now considering voting a natural right which no state can take away from you.\" They also now believed, crucially, \"that the federal government has a right to intervene to protect the right to vote.\"\n\nThe three amendments of the Reconstruction era radically transformed American life and the role of the federal government. The final section of each amendment grants Congress the power to enforce the amendments with appropriate legislation. Whereas the first clause of the Bill of Rights, drafted some 80 years earlier, was the injunction that \"Congress shall make no law,\" now the three Reconstruction Amendments gave the state permission to act: \"Congress shall have the power to enforce...\"\n\nFoner sees the three amendments as part of one working whole: the rapidly evolving project of resolving the just emancipation of 4 million slaves and the reunification of the country. \"By putting into the Constitution the notion that Congress shall have the power to enforce this, that guarantees that it's an ongoing process,\" Foner says. \"They anticipate that Congress will have to come back and back and back and figure out, 'Okay, we didn't anticipate this would happen. Now we're passing a law to deal with it under the 14th Amendment or under the 15th Amendment.' They left themselves the power to deal with any oppressive measures that came along.\"\n\nNow would be a good time to resurrect that power.\n\nFelon disenfranchisement is the most significant form of voter suppression today. But it is not the only one. In 2013, the Supreme Court struck down a key provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act under the antebellum logic that states should have free rein in setting qualifications for voting, effectively ignoring the Reconstruction Amendments. In the years since, states under the control of the Republican Party (now the party of white voters, particularly in the South) began to restrict ballot access through voter ID laws, poll closures, and purges of the voter rolls, to name a few examples. In 2020, as millions attempted to vote by mail during the coronavirus pandemic, Republicans sought to make voting harder. In Texas, Republicans tried to invalidate ballots cast at drive-through voting sites. In North Carolina, a signature match law for absentee ballots disproportionately resulted in Black voters' ballots being tossed. In Pennsylvania, a court ruled that absentee ballots would be invalid if they had not been placed in so-called \"secrecy slips\" before being placed in their envelopes. If a fundamental right is negated by the lack of an extra envelope, is it really fundamental?\n\nThere's power in the Reconstruction Amendments to upend all of these voter suppression schemes. \"There's a lot of latent power, unused but still there, in the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments and in the legislation that was passed to enforce them,\" says Foner. But Section 2, long forgotten, is particularly enticing in this moment. \"It was put in the Constitution precisely to deal with what we are facing today, significant disenfranchisement of American citizens by the states. And that they have to pay a penalty if they're trying to do that.\"\n\nFor 150 years, Section 2 was left dormant, except to disenfranchise convicted offenders. In 1869, Congress considered limiting the representation of Northern states that banned Black suffrage, but chose not to because the 15th Amendment was on the verge of ratification. The fact that the 15th Amendment enshrined what Section 2 did not leads Gabriel Chin, a professor at the University of California, Davis, School of Law, to argue that Section 2 was actually repealed by the 15th Amendment-a failed experiment that was quickly replaced with an explicit ban on racial discrimination in voting. Chin further argues that Congress' failure ever to enforce Section 2 constitutes evidence of its repeal. But Congress did attempt to enforce Section 2 at least twice. In the early 1870s, there was a failed effort to reduce representation from Southern states. After Reconstruction, several Southern states passed constitutions that effectively banned Black men from voting, leading some Republicans in Congress to attempt again to use Section 2 to reduce the number of delegates from those states at the turn of the century, but that effort also failed. In 1904, use of Section 2 was included in the Republican Party's platform. And in 1921, W.E.B. Du Bois wrote an editorial in the NAACP magazine, The Crisis , urging Congress to use Section 2 against Southern states. But neither party \"was willing to stand up for the rights of Black people,\" says Foner. \"It was racism, fundamentally.\"\n\nResurrecting Section 2 in the name of voting rights would restore its original purpose: to be a hammer against voter suppression, not carte blanche for felon disenfranchisement. This is how it should have been applied all along.\n\nAccording to scholars I spoke with, there is in fact no reason that Congress couldn't-and shouldn't-begin shrinking a state's delegation if it disenfranchises some of its citizens. But what if Congress could take less drastic measures to ensure the right to vote instead?\n\nWhat's appealing about Section 2 is that its language in defense of voting rights is the most powerful in the Constitution. Section 2 doesn't actually rely on proof of racial discrimination to kick in. It doesn't even require any bad intentions. All that matters to trigger Section 2 is if \"the right to vote...is denied...or in any way abridged.\" And Congress shall have the power to enforce it. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg laid out this road map in her dissent to the 2013 Shelby v. Holder decision that gutted the Voting Rights Act. Though she did not name Section 2 directly, she indicated that the power to enforce the constitutional amendments that mention voting gives Congress \"the lead rein in making the right to vote equally real for all U.S. citizens.\"\n\nToday, lawmakers couch their efforts at voter suppression as procedural matters of election administration: extra hurdles a voter must clear to successfully vote. Harking back to the old states' rights pretext, courts allowed these measures to stand in the runup to the 2020 election, even as Democratic lawyers protested that thousands would lose the ability to vote. \"We are being absolutely deferential to states on the question of the conditions under which voting occurs,\" says Franita Tolson, an expert on constitutional and election law at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law. \"By getting this analysis away from intent, [Section 2] actually can do a lot for protecting the right to vote more generally. The courts are still looking for bad actors.\" Instead, they should be looking at how voting requirements disenfranchise eligible voters. But judges repeatedly view requirements such as ID laws as entirely within the power of the legislature no matter their effect on voters.\n\nA 1964 demonstration in front of an Indianapolis hotel where then-Alabama Gov. George Wallace was staying.\n\nBob Daugherty/AP\n\nTolson believes that Section 2, along with the power to enforce it, gives Congress wide latitude to protect against disenfranchisement and onerous voting requirements. Shrinking a state's delegation is the upper bound of what Congress can do, she argues. It can also take less intrusive measures, such as passing laws to ban restrictive voting laws, setting federal standards for ballot access, and resurrecting the federal oversight of jurisdictions with a history of disenfranchisement that the Supreme Court cut out of the Voting Rights Act. This is a vision of the power of the Reconstruction Amendments that would not sit well with our current Supreme Court, with its retrograde record on voting rights. But a Congress dedicated to voting rights and the spirit of the Reconstruction Amendments should not be deterred by a hostile court, even if it stands in the way. For one thing, any conservative court decision seeking to preserve felon disenfranchisement would have to manage a tricky feat: cutting the knees out from under Section 2 without upending \"or other crime,\" too. There is also a moral imperative. To compromise at all on this score is to relinquish Congress' power to ensure a fair democracy. It is to accept the premises of the Confederate dead-enders-that some people are less than others and thus less deserving of a full grant of citizenship.\n\nBut reanimating Section 2 also means dealing with disenfranchisement. The drafters of Section 2 specifically sanctioned felon disenfranchisement and they declined repeatedly to take it off the table in the Reconstruction Act and readmission acts, as well as in the 15th Amendment. \"If they explicitly endorsed this specific restriction, then how can it be in the spirit of their politics to overturn it?\" says Alec Ewald, an expert in felon disenfranchisement at the University of Vermont. His answer is in the moral intentions of the framers of the 14th Amendment. \"It's hard for me to imagine a Republican from the Reconstruction period who would not be horrified by the combination of social and political inequality that disenfranchisement brings about, because of their key concern for racial equality and political inclusion, as they understood those things at the time,\" he says-though few supported women's suffrage, and gaping exceptions found their way into the Reconstruction Amendments. For Ewald, the Supreme Court should have heeded the framers' goal-political equality-without blindly protecting the specific carve-outs they found acceptable at the time.\n\nBut to fully understand the Supreme Court's wrongheadedness in 1974 when it allowed felon disenfranchisement to go unchecked, you have to understand the court's logic and how completely divorced it was from the intentions of those who wrote the 14th Amendment. The first section of the amendment promises equal protection and due process under the law. In 1974, the Supreme Court decided that Section 1 did not apply to Section 2; in other words, felon disenfranchisement was not constrained by the fact that it was disproportionately applied to Black people, and it did not matter that Black people were not treated equally under the law. In the years that followed, the court became, as Justice John Paul Stevens put it, a loyal foot soldier in the War on Drugs, expanding police powers and essentially greenlighting racial profiling. Law enforcement was, for all intents and purposes, outside the bounds of equal protection, and so was the disenfranchisement that stemmed from it. By the 1990s, the Supreme Court had held that little prevented cops from stopping drivers because they were Black; if a subsequent conviction cost those people their right to vote, that was likewise constitutional.\n\nBut the 14th Amendment never envisioned this reality. Section 1, with its promise of civil equality, was written to obliterate laws that applied disproportionately to one race. At the time, they were called Black Codes; now they are simply our criminal codes. The rebels in North Carolina, the ones who began seizing Black men, convicting them in all-white courts, and whipping them, thought they had found a loophole in the 14th Amendment. But the very system of justice they used to disenfranchise the freed slaves under Section 2 should have been invalidated by Section 1. Section 2 was supposed to operate in a world in which justice was applied equally, not a world of racial profiling and selective application of the law. As Congress made clear in the readmission acts, felon disenfranchisement was supposed to apply only \" whereof they shall have been duly convicted, under laws equally applicable to all of the inhabitants of said state .\"\n\nToday, the Supreme Court allows felon disenfranchisement in a criminal justice system that is not equally applied. We are living completely within that North Carolina loophole. For a century and a half, Congress had untapped authority to punish voter suppression and inequality under the law-despite the Supreme Court's decades-­long efforts to preserve an apartheid system of justice. To ignore that latent power is to ignore the crisis itself.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "The Republican National Committee Continues to Live in a Fantasyland Where Trump Wins Over Black Voters\n\nJohn Bazemore/AP\n\nOn May 22, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee and former Vice President Joe Biden appeared on The Breakfast Club, a syndicated radio show. During the interview, Charlamagne tha God, its Black host who has a knack for making Democratic politicians appear to be pandering, asked what Biden thought about Black voters who didn't support him. Biden responded forcefully (and memorably), \"If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't Black.\"\n\nBiden later apologized , but the Trump campaign pounced, launching a $1 million advertising blitz highlighting Biden's comments and selling $30 \" You Ain't Black \" T-shirts. \"It was particularly dehumanizing,\" Katrina Pierson, a Black senior adviser to the Trump campaign told Fox News, referring to Biden's comments.\n\nPresident Donald Trump needs every opportunity he can get to shore up Black votes. Last November, in the midst of the Trump-Ukraine scandal , the president's reelection campaign launched Black Voices for Trump, a national coalition of prominent Black conservatives including Pierson, failed presidential candidate and former pizza mogul Herman Cain , controversial pastor Darrell Scott , and Paris Dennard, the senior communications adviser for Black media affairs at the Republican National Committee. As I reported last year, the announcement of the campaign's Black vote effort sounded more like a typical Trump rally than a new initiative-the crowd broke out into chants of \"Blacks for Trump! Blacks for Trump!\" Meanwhile the president outlined his usual talking points of complaining about the media and the investigation into his dealings with the Russian government.\n\nBut several months, one pandemic, and countless incidents of shocking police brutality later (accompanied by countless incidents of presidential insensitivity), the RNC and likely the Trump 2020 campaign, still seems to be operating under the illusion that it has a coherent message that will persuade Black voters to support him.\n\n\"From day one of the campaign President Trump has been committed to earning the vote of Black Americans,\" the RNC's Dennard told me in an email. But as crises that have a disproportionate impact on Black people roil the nation, the president has offered more of the same incompetence and dog-whistling . When I asked how recent events will square with their effort to reach out to Black voters, Dennard simply recycled old talking points-the once low unemployment numbers, for instance, and criminal justice reform-and asserted that the effort to reach Black voters is going well.\n\nBlack support for Trump was low before he even became president. Ben Carson was just another failed presidential candidate in 2016 when he tepidly endorsed Trump. \"Even if Donald Trump turns out not to be such a great president, which I don't think is the case, I think he's going to surround himself with really good people,\" he said . \"But even if he didn't, we're only looking at four years as opposed to multiple generations, and perhaps the loss of the American dream forever.\" (The retired neurosurgeon became Trump's only Black cabinet member as head of the Department of Housing and Urban Development.) According to exit polls, Trump won 8 percent of Black votes in 2016 and hasn't gotten much more Black support over the last three years. As I wrote when Blacks Voices for Trump was inaugurated last year:\n\nIf you've been paying even a modicum of attention since Trump first walked onto the political stage, those low numbers aren't surprising. Trump launched his political career by propagating the lie that Barack Obama was a secret Muslim born in Kenya. He became one of the loudest birthers demanding that Obama provide his birth certificate and school records. In 2017, after white nationalists descended on Charlottesville, Virginia, and one killed Heather Heyer after plowing his car into a crowd of protesters, Trump said that there were \" very fine people \" on both sides. He also reportedly referred to Haiti and African countries as \"shithole countries.\" In 2019 alone, Trump suggested four brown and black congresswoman \"go back\" to their countries , despite the fact that three of the four were born in the United States; called Baltimore, which is part of the late Elijah Cummings' congressional district, \" rat infested \" after Cummings criticized the Department of Homeland Security for poor conditions in immigrant detention centers; and compared the impeachment inquiry process to lynching .\n\nAll of those racist remarks obviously occurred when unemployment was low, a pandemic had not yet disrupted lives and the economy, and brutal police killings did not spark a national cry for justice. In January, the novel coronavirus appeared in the United States and began spreading widely, killing more than 110,000 and infecting close to 2 million people by June. While the Trump administration downplayed the threat and offered no systematic plan for testing or treatment or containing the spread, Black and Brown people disproportionately suffered. Meanwhile, the economy collapsed as a result of the shutdown from the virus, and workers filed more than 40 million unemployment claims. Then last month, widespread unrest swept the nation after white police officer Derek Chauvin killed George Floyd, a Black man in Minneapolis, by kneeling on his neck for nearly nine minutes. The video of the killing started an uprising and a protest movement against systemic racism not seen in generations.\n\nIn response, there have been no reassuring presidential messages of unity or comfort to Black Americans. Instead, there have been tweets. In the last few weeks alone, Trump has tweeted \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts,\" a reference to a racist police chief from the 1960s. He also retweeted an account smearing Floyd and supported a fake conspiracy theory that the 75-year-old man in Bufffalo who was pushed by police officers and left bleeding on the sidewalk was staged. He also urged governors to crack down harder on anti-racism protesters, saying they will look like jerks if they don't \"dominate.\" He referred to those who demonstrated as \"THUGS.\" After pausing his rallies for three months because of the pandemic, Trump announced that the first one would be held on June 19 , also known as Juneteenth, a holiday that celebrates the end of slavery in the United States in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the site of a 1921 massive racist massacre.\n\nA Trump rally with rebel flags (a symbol of slavery and racism) in Tulsa, OK (the place of #TulsaMassacre ) on Juneteenth (a day of emancipation recognition) is more than a slap in the face to African Americans; it is overt racism from the highest office in the land. #RejectRacism\n\n- Congressman Al Green (@RepAlGreen) June 11, 2020\n\nOn Friday morning, Trump's 2020 campaign manager tweeted that the date was no problem, because Abraham Lincoln, who signed the Emancipation Proclamation which freed the slaves, was a Republican.\n\nAs the Party of Lincoln, Republicans are proud of what Juneteenth represents and the Emancipation Proclamation. @realDonaldTrump has a solid record of success for Black Americans.\n\nIt's @JoeBiden who has the horrible record of racial division and condescension.\n\nFacts matter.\n\n- Brad Parscale (@parscale) June 11, 2020\n\n\"Through the direct engagement on the ground, via social media, and with Black media outlets of the RNC and Black Voices for Trump we are already seeing tremendous gains,\" Dennard said. \"This is a national strategic effort with real people from the community, real dollars behind it and seeing real results already, and it is just June.\"\n\nTrump's overall approval numbers nationwide have collapsed to just 39 percent. An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll found that 88 percent of Black people said Trump has increased racial tensions. A CNN poll found that 91 percent of Black voters thought Biden would do a better job on race relations than Trump.\n\nDennard disagrees. \"We look forward to contrasting the 3.5-year record of achievement for the Black Community of President Donald Trump to that of the 44 year record of inaction of Joe Biden,\" he noted. \"President Trump worked to right the wrongs of the 1994 Crime Bill written by Joe Biden.\" Despite his overwhelming support among Black voters, the former VP is still dogged by his work in the Senate as one of the main architects of the sweeping legislation, which critics say helped increased the prison population and enabled a policing system that harms communities of color.\n\nDennard provides a unique spin on Trump's law and order policies: \"When the President talks about restoring law and order he is talking about protecting those Black-owned businesses literally on fire, being looted and destroyed.\" Trump also had an opportunity to protect Black-owned businesses in the wake of the COVID-19 closures. The Paycheck Protection Program created by the Small Business Administration was supposed to help business owners weather the economic storm. The federal government has released scant data on who is receiving the loans but according to a survey of 500 Black and Latino business owners by racial equality groups Color of Change and UnidosUS, only 12 percent received help.\n\nDespite the dramatically changed political and social landscape in 2020, Republicans are relying on the same talking points they've had for years. The campaign would like to focus on the 2018 First Step Act, a law that allows early release for certain incarcerated individuals, and opportunity zones , a program for low-income communities in which rich developers will get a tax break for \"investing\" in those neighborhoods.\n\nNot that these two accomplishments have come without criticism. The Department of Justice is actually trying to return some of the people released by the First Step Act to prison. \"[Trump's] Justice Department is actively pushing to send some of these same people back behind bars, and to prevent others from reducing their sentences,\" my colleague Samantha Michaels reported in February, \"which greatly limits who can benefit from the law that Trump has touted as one of his signature achievements.\" And many critics are calling foul on opportunity zones, saying they're actually a new scheme to line the pockets of the wealthy.\n\nWhile Trump struggles to lead a nation through two calamities, videos of police officers violently attacking protesters has caused big shifts in how white Americans view racism and criminal justice. A Washington Post poll found that 69 percent of Americans believe the recent killings of Black people by police represent a broader national problem, a 26 point increase since 2014. Broken down along party lines, 86 percent of Democrats and 47 percent of Republicans agree. The country appears to be on the cusp of a real reckoning of how policing perpetuates systemic racism and harms Black communities.\n\n\"What the hell do you have to lose?\" Trump asked a crowd of supporters at an Ohio rally in 2016. He was referring to decades of systemic inequality that had left Black people with higher rates of poverty. The Trump campaign is still using that line to garner Black support. Except this time around, the answer has never been clearer.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Jim Crow Killed Voting Rights for Generations. Now the GOP Is Repeating History.\n\nGeorgia state Sen. David Lucas Sheila Pree Bright\n\nAri Berman June 2, 2021\n\nOn September 3, 1868, Henry McNeal Turner rose to speak in the Georgia House of Representatives to fight for his political survival. He was one of 33 new Black state legislators elected that year in Georgia, a revolutionary change in the South after 250 years of slavery. Eight hundred thousand new Black voters had been registered across the region, and the share of Black male Southerners who were eligible to vote skyrocketed from 0.5 percent in 1866 to 80.5 percent two years later.\n\nThese Black legislators had helped to write a new state constitution guaranteeing voting rights for former slaves and leading Georgia back into the Union. Yet just two months after the 14th Amendment granted full citizenship rights to Black Americans, Georgia's white-dominated legislature introduced a bill to expel the Black lawmakers, arguing that the state's constitution protected their right to vote but not to hold office. \"You bring both Congress and the Republican Party into odium in this state,\" said Joseph E. Brown, who had served as governor during the Confederacy years, when \"you confer upon the Negroes the right to hold office...in their present condition.\"\n\nTurner was shocked. Born free in South Carolina, he'd been appointed by Abraham Lincoln as the first Black chaplain in the Union Army. After the war, he settled in Macon, Georgia's fifth-largest city, where he was elected to the legislature. As a gesture of goodwill, he'd pushed to restore voting rights to ex-Confederates. But now white members of the legislature-both Democrats and Republicans-were turning on their Black colleagues.\n\nTurner's passionate speech would become a rallying cry for the civil rights movement 100 years later. \"Am I a man?\" he asked. \"If I am such, I claim the rights of a man. Am I not a man because I happen to be of a darker hue than honorable gentlemen around me?\"\n\nHenry McNeal Turner's \"I Claim the Rights of a Man\" speech became a rallying cry of the civil rights era.\n\nTime Life/Getty\n\nBut his pleas went unheeded. The legislature voted to expel the Black lawmakers , who weren't even allowed to participate in the vote. \"The sacred rights of my race,\" said Turner, were \"destroyed at one blow.\" Soon he was getting death threats from the Ku Klux Klan. \"We should neither be seized with astonishment or regret\" if he were to be lynched, editorialized the Weekly Sun of Columbus, Georgia. Two weeks later, one of the ousted Black legislators, Philip Joiner, led a march to the small town of Camilla in southwest Georgia, where white residents opened fire , killing a dozen or more of the mostly Black marchers.\n\nFor more articles read aloud: download the Audm iPhone app .\n\nAnd so Reconstruction all but ended in Georgia almost as soon as it began. Outraged Republicans in Washington attempted to reinstate it, putting the state back under military rule , purging ex-Confederates from the legislature, and giving Black members their seats back. But in the 1870 election, Georgia's white majority united to reclaim the state and vote out the Black members, backed up by KKK violence that kept many Black people from the polls. \"There is not language in the vocabulary of hell strong enough to portray the outrages that have been perpetrated,\" Turner wrote to Massachusetts Sen. Charles Sumner. Five years after the war ended, ex-Confederates had retaken Georgia. \"The Southern whites will never consent to the government of the Negro,\" said Democratic US Sen. Benjamin Hill. \"Never!\" Georgia became a blueprint for how white supremacy would be restored throughout the South.\n\nOne hundred and fifty years later, another Georgia legislator representing Macon rose to defend the rights Turner had fought for. Like Turner, Democratic state Sen. David Lucas is an African Methodist Episcopal minister. In 1974, at just 24, he became the first Black member of the legislature to represent Macon since Reconstruction-a product of the second Reconstruction, of the 1960s, when the country passed civil rights laws, including the Voting Rights Act, to restore the squandered promise of the first. With his Super Fly suit and Honda 750 motorcycle, he stood out among the good ol' boys in the state Capitol.\n\nOn February 23, 2021, Lucas, now 71, took to the Senate podium to oppose a new voter-ID requirement for mail-in ballots introduced by Georgia Republicans. In 2005, Republicans had specifically exempted mail-in ballots from the state's voter-ID law, believing that more rural and elderly voters would be the ones casting them. But now they were changing the rules after the Black share of mail-in voters increased by 8 points in 2020 and the white share fell by 13 points. The measure was one of 50 anti-voting bills they'd introduced after the state went blue in November and Donald Trump tried to overturn the election results by falsely alleging a massive conspiracy to rig the vote.\n\nLucas, the in-house historian of Georgia's Legislative Black Caucus, said the bill \"reminds me of the election of 1876.\" He told the story of the disputed presidential contest that put Rutherford B. Hayes in the White House on the condition that he would withdraw federal troops from the South, officially ending Reconstruction. \"When they pulled out the federal troops,\" said Lucas, \"that's when we had Jim Crow and folks got lynched.\"\n\nThis history was personal for Lucas. When he was 13 and playing four square with friends, the police picked him up and falsely accused him of throwing a rock through a white driver's windshield. They took him to a convenience store, where the driver got in the back of the police car, placed a gun to his head, \"and told me he'd kill me,\" Lucas said. Later, as a student at Tuskegee University, he worked on the campaigns of the first Black legislators elected in Alabama since Reconstruction, and worked with a Black professor of political science to register Black voters in the area. As he canvassed small-town dusty roads, white men in pickup trucks would drive by with shotguns and ask him, \"Why are you registering folks to vote?\"\n\nAfter 45 years in office, he told his colleagues emotionally, he couldn't believe he still had to defend his right to vote. What should have been the country's most fundamental principle remained the most contested. \"I will not go home and tell those folks who voted that I took away the right for you to vote,\" Lucas vowed on the Senate floor.\n\nA month later, Georgia Republicans passed a sweeping rewrite of the state's election laws-rolling back access to mail-in ballots, limiting drop boxes, making it possible for right-wing groups to challenge voter eligibility, and boosting the heavily gerrymandered legislature's power over election administration. Across the country, nearly 400 bills were introduced in the first five months of 2021 to limit voting access , the largest number of voting restrictions proposed at one time since the end of Reconstruction .\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed the state's voting bill alongside six white male Republicans, under a painting of a slave plantation. When Park Cannon, a young Black Democratic state representative from Atlanta, knocked on the governor's door demanding to see the signing, Georgia state police arrested her and dragged her from the Capitol, charging her with two felonies (soon dropped)-a scene that harked back to the brutal crackdowns against 20th-century civil rights activists. \"If you don't like being called a racist or Jim Crow, then stop acting like one,\" Democratic state Sen. Nikki Merritt told her white Republican colleagues following the arrest. Former Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, founder of the voting rights group Fair Fair Action, called the law \" Jim Crow in a suit and tie .\"\n\nDuring Reconstruction, racial equality was written into the US Constitution for the first time. It was nothing less than a \" second founding ,\" Columbia University historian Eric Foner wrote in his 2019 book of the same name. Trailblazing Black lawmakers like Turner were elected, and the party that was aligned with Black voting rights made inroads in a region dominated for a century by the party of white supremacy. Multiracial government became a fact of life where white minority rule had been the norm.\n\nThe overthrow of Reconstruction was a stark reminder of the fragility of progress on voting rights. The second Reconstruction that began in the 1960s was marked by long, slow advancement that culminated in 2020, when Black voters turned out in record numbers to elect the state's first Black and Jewish US senators. \"After I finished crying, I was just so elated, that Georgia stands alone in the South,\" said State Rep. Al Williams, who marched from Selma to Montgomery with John Lewis and was arrested 17 times during the civil rights movement. \"A Jewish guy and a Black Baptist preacher-who would have ever thought it?\"\n\nBut the vicious white backlash that has followed those victories-an attempt to overturn the election, an insurrection at the US Capitol, a record number of bills to restrict voting rights-has all the makings of a concerted attempt to end the second Reconstruction.\n\nThe means have changed and grown less violent, but the basic idea is the same: to couch voting restrictions in race-blind language to disenfranchise new voters and communities of color. Once again, the party of white grievance is rewriting the rules of American democracy to protect conservative white political power from the rising influence of new demographic groups. \"Nobody's putting in a literacy test, nobody's putting in a poll tax,\" says Yale historian David Blight. \"But there are all kinds of ways for how to just restrict voting this time. Rather than utter disfranchisement, they are obviously going for: Knock off 5 percent of the Black vote, and you can once again win Georgia.\"\n\nRep. Park Cannon is arrested in the Georgia Capitol after knocking on Gov. Brian Kemp's office door while Kemp signed a sweeping voting law.\n\nAlyssa Pointer/Atlanta Journal-Constitution/AP\n\nIn August 1890, ex-Confederate leaders in Mississippi convened to draft a new state constitution that would disenfranchise Black voters once and for all. \"Let us tell the truth if it bursts the bottom of the Universe,\" said Mississippi Supreme Court Justice Solomon S. Calhoon. \"We came here to exclude the Negro. Nothing short of this will answer.\"\n\nReconstruction had brought even bigger changes to Mississippi than to Georgia because Mississippi had a Black majority. More than 225 Black officeholders were elected, including two US senators, a congressman, speaker of the house, lieutenant governor, secretary of state, and superintendent of education. It was the very success of Reconstruction that made white Mississippians so determined to overthrow it.\n\nIn 1875, ex-Confederates had retaken the state following the Georgia model: White Democrats formed paramilitary groups and attacked Republican meetings, threatened economic reprisals against Black farmers, and stuffed ballot boxes.\n\n\"If a colored man said he was going to register, they advised him not to,\" said Aurelius Parker, a member of the legislature. \"If he was still determined in his statement that he was going to register, they would tell him that if he did register, he could not vote.\" Those who ignored such threats were told, \"You had better spend Monday digging a grave for yourself if you intend to vote, for you will not be allowed to live.\"\n\nWhite Democrats weren't always proud of the methods they used to keep Black people from the polls. \"It is no secret that there has not been a fair count in Mississippi since 1875, that we have been preserving the ascendancy of the white people by revolutionary methods,\" Judge J.B. Chrisman said during an unusually candid speech at the state constitutional convention in 1890. \"In other words, we have been stuffing ballot boxes, committing perjury, and here and there in the state carrying the elections by fraud and violence...No man can be in favor of perpetuating the election methods which have prevailed in Mississippi since 1875 who is not a moral idiot.\"\n\nThey soon shifted tactics to achieve the same goal. The Reconstruction laws were technically still on the books, and if Republicans, who had taken unified control of the federal government in 1888 for the first time since the Grant administration, passed new legislation to enforce the 15th Amendment, which guaranteed men the right to vote regardless of race, Black people could regain their influence in the state. So Mississippi Democrats attempted something historic, drafting a new state constitution \"to effect an electorate under which there could be white supremacy through honest elections,\" wrote J.S. McNeily of the Vicksburg Herald .\n\nThe constitutional convention established a dizzying array of devices to eliminate Black suffrage , including a poll tax and the disqualification of prospective voters who committed minor crimes like \"obtaining goods under false pretenses\"-offenses for which Black people were disproportionately charged. The centerpiece of the plan was a requirement that any voter \"be able to read any section of the Constitution of this State; or he shall be able to understand the same when read to him, or give a reasonable interpretation thereof.\" This \"understanding clause\" gave local white election officials tremendous discretion to turn away Black people, while permitting local whites who might fail such a test to vote regardless.\n\nThere are striking similarities between the Mississippi plan of 1890 and the Georgia plan of 2021. The same pattern that existed during Reconstruction-the enfranchisement of Black voters, followed by the manipulation of election laws to throw out Black votes, culminating in laws passed to legally disenfranchise Black voters-is repeating itself today.\n\nTrump told Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to \"find 11,780 votes\" to nullify Joe Biden's victory, and Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani asked the state legislature to appoint its own presidential electors to overturn the will of the voters. When these efforts failed, Georgia Republicans rushed to change their voting laws to make it much easier for Republican candidates to find those votes in future elections-replacing extralegal attempts to rig the election with ostensibly legal ones.\n\nThe proponents of these laws have defended them in eerily similar ways. White Mississippians of the 1890s claimed there was nothing racist about their new constitution because it was intended \"to correct the evil, not of Negro suffrage per se, but of ignorant and debased suffrage,\" said Mississippi Democratic Sen. James Z. George. The \"understanding clause\" was \"an enlargement of the right to vote and not a restriction upon it,\" George argued, since it did not disenfranchise voters if they could sufficiently interpret the Constitution-a loophole that, in practice, existed for white people, not Black people.\n\nSimilarly, in 2021, Kemp said \"there is nothing Jim Crow\" about the Georgia law and argued that it \"expands access to the ballot box,\" pointing to a provision that requires more days of weekend voting. That won't affect large counties in the Atlanta area that already offered multiple days of weekend voting but will create more voting opportunities for rural counties that lean Republican. Nor did Kemp mention the 16 different provisions that make it harder to vote and that target metro Atlanta counties with large Black populations.\n\nAnd both plans had built-in backstops in case they didn't succeed in manipulating the electorate. In post-Reconstruction Mississippi, the lieutenant governor and secretary of state would appoint all the local election officials, who could ensure the results favored white Democrats. This consolidation of election authority was replicated by Democrats across the South. In Maryland, South Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana, the governor appointed the county commissioners who selected the election judges. In Alabama and Arkansas, election officials were chosen by a state board led by the governor; in Virginia and North Carolina, the legislature appointed them.\n\nThis year, after Raffensperger rebuffed Trump's demand to overturn the election, the Georgia legislature stripped the secretary of state of his chairmanship and voting rights on the state election board; and lawmakers instead gave the legislature the power to appoint a majority of board members. The board, in turn, has the authority to take over up to four county election boards it deems underperforming. And since November, at least nine GOP-controlled counties have dissolved their bipartisan election boards to create all-Republican panels. Combined with a provision allowing right-wing groups to mount an unlimited number of challenges to voter eligibility, these changes will make it easier for Republicans to contest close elections and possibly overturn the results.\n\nAbove: People wait to register to vote in Macon, Georgia, in 1962. Below: Voters in Cobb County, Georgia, wait in line for up to three hours during the 2018 midterms.\n\nUnited States Information Agency/Getty; Jessica McGowan/Getty\n\nThen, as now, Congress had the power to stop the disenfranchisement of Black voters.\n\nOne month before the Mississippi convention of 1890, the House of Representatives passed a bill sponsored by Massachusetts Rep. Henry Cabot Lodge empowering federal supervisors to oversee registration, voting, and ballot counting in the South, and giving federal judges the power to invalidate fraudulent election results. \"The Government which made the Black man a citizen of the United States is bound to protect him in his rights as a citizen of the United States, and it is a cowardly Government if it does not do it!\" Lodge said.\n\nSenate Republicans also greeted the Mississippi convention with outrage, vowing to approve the Lodge bill when they returned to the chamber that fall. But Democrats staged a dramatic filibuster -the first of many Southern-led filibusters to kill civil rights legislation-giving exhaustive speeches and using a variety of endless procedural delays to derail the bill. Sen. George of Mississippi alone gave three marathon speeches in opposition. \"It will never come to pass in Mississippi, in Florida, in South Carolina, or any other State in the South, in any State in the American Union, that the neck of the white race shall be under the foot of the Negro,\" he vowed.\n\nWith the support of a group of Western Republicans from sparsely populated mining states who feared the expansion of suffrage to Chinese immigrants, Senate Democrats mounted a sneak attack on January 5, 1891. Democrats were quietly told to hastily assemble in the chamber. Democrat Isham G. Harris of Tennessee controlled the gavel while Vice President Levi Morton, a Republican who usually presided over the business of the Senate, was taking a leisurely lunch. As Republicans angrily protested, the assembled senators voted 34 to 29 to scrap the Lodge bill .\n\nToday, the parties have flipped, but the situation is similar. Aided by national dark money groups like Heritage Action for America , Republican-controlled states are rushing to pass new voting restrictions while Democrats in Congress are pushing two sweeping bills to protect voting rights and stop many of these efforts. Once again, these bills are likely to be blocked by a Senate filibuster . Republicans have denounced one of the bills, HR 1, in the same apocalyptic terms that Democrats once used to criticize the Lodge bill. Ted Cruz of Texas called it \"the single most dangerous piece of legislation before Congress.\"\n\nThe failure of the Lodge bill is a stark reminder of the costs of inaction, both for democracy and for the party that supports Black voting rights. Following its defeat, Democrats suppressed the Black vote so efficiently that they gained unified control of the federal government in 1893 for the first time since before the Civil War. They promptly repealed the laws that had been used to enforce Reconstruction and protect Black suffrage.\n\n\"Let every trace of the reconstruction measures be wiped from the statute books; let the States of this great Union understand that the elections are in their own hands,\" House Democrats wrote in an 1893 report. \"Responding to a universal sentiment throughout the country for greater purity in elections many of our States have enacted laws to protect the voter and to purify the ballot.\" A similar phrase-\"preserve the purity of the ballot box\"-was inserted by Texas Republicans in a sweeping anti-voting bill this year and stricken only after Democrats pointed out that it dated back to Jim Crow. (The final version of the Texas bill, which would have curtailed voting methods disproportionately used by Black and Brown voters and made it easier to overturn election results, was blocked in the state House after Democrats staged a dramatic walkout before a midnight deadline, denying Republicans the necessary quorum to pass it.)\n\nFollowing the adoption of the Mississippi plan and failure of the Lodge bill, by 1907 every Southern state had changed its constitution to disenfranchise Black voters , through poll taxes, literacy tests, property requirements, and complex registration and residency laws. The number of Black registered voters in Mississippi fell from 130,483 in 1876 to 1,264 by 1900; in Louisiana from roughly 130,000 in 1896 to 1,342 in 1904; in Alabama's Black Belt counties from 79,311 in 1900 to 1,081 in 1901.\n\nBy the early 1900s, only 7 percent of Black residents were registered to vote in seven Southern states, according to data compiled by the historian Morgan Kousser, and Black turnout fell from 61 percent of the voting-age population in 1880 to just 2 percent in 1912.\n\n\"The failure of the Lodge bill was taken by the white South as a go-ahead,\" says Foner. \"'The Republican Party has given up, and therefore we can go forward.'\"\n\nOnce voting rights are taken away, the history of Reconstruction shows how difficult it is to get them back. If Congress fails to act, don't expect the courts to step in.\n\nIn 1898, the US Supreme Court upheld the Mississippi plan , despite clear evidence of Black disenfranchisement and the racial motivations behind it. The law's provisions \"do not on their face discriminate between the races, and it has not been shown that their actual administration was evil, only that evil was possible under them,\" Justice Joseph McKenna wrote.\n\nFive years later, Jackson Giles, president of the Colored Men's Suffrage Association of Alabama, challenged Alabama's literacy test on behalf of 5,000 Black citizens in Montgomery. Giles had voted in Montgomery for 30 years before the new constitution disenfranchised him. Yet the Supreme Court said there was nothing it could do to help him. \"Relief from a great political wrong, if done, as alleged, by the people of a state and the state itself, must be given by them or by the legislative and political department of the government of the United States,\" wrote Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes in 1903.\n\nThe states' rights jurisprudence of the post-Reconstruction court has been resurrected by today's court , which under Chief Justice John Roberts has gutted the Voting Rights Act , refused to overturn partisan gerrymandering, and almost completely turned its back on efforts to protect voting rights for communities of color. The 2013 decision in Shelby County v. Holder -when the court's conservative majority ruled that states like Georgia and Mississippi, with a history of discrimination, no longer needed to clear their voting changes with the federal government-had an impact similar to Hayes' decision to withdraw federal troops from the South in 1877. The federal government, it was clear, had abandoned its commitment to enforce the Reconstruction Amendments to the Constitution.\n\n\"The only thing that protects people's access to the vote is federal protection, federal intervention,\" says Northwestern University historian Kate Masur. \"If nothing else, that pattern is clear in US history.\"\n\nOn March 17, 2021, a week before Georgia passed its voter suppression law, Raphael Warnock gave his maiden speech on the floor of the US Senate. Like Henry McNeal Turner, Warnock was a preacher before he became a politician, and his election was followed by a horrific act of violence.\n\n\"We elected Georgia's first African American and Jewish senator, and, hours later, the Capitol was assaulted,\" Warnock told his colleagues. \"We see in just a few precious hours the tension very much alive in the soul of America.\"\n\nWhen he was born in 1969, Warnock said, Georgia still had two arch-segregationist senators, Richard B. Russell and Herman E. Talmadge. After the Supreme Court's 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision, Talmadge predicted that \" blood will run in the streets of Atlanta \" if schools were desegregated. When Talmadge's father, Eugene, the state's longtime segregationist governor, was asked in 1946 how he would keep Blacks away from the polls after the federal courts invalidated the state's whites-only primary, he picked up a scrap of paper and wrote a single word: \" pistols .\"\n\nWarnock noted that he now held the Senate seat \"where Herman E. Talmadge sat.\" That was progress, but the immediate backlash showed just how entrenched the reactionary forces in American politics had become. At the time, 250 bills had been introduced at the state level to restrict voting rights. One month later, when Warnock testified at a Senate hearing on \" Jim Crow 2021 ,\" the number of proposed restrictions had increased by more than 100, and Georgia was at the center of a heated national debate over voter suppression. \"I come here today to stress the critical need for the federal government to act urgently to protect the sacred right to vote,\" he said.\n\nThe last time that happened, when Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965, he compared it to the last battle over slavery, to redress not just the country's original sin, but the failed hope of Reconstruction. The Union victory at Appomattox was \"an American victory but also a Negro victory,\" Johnson said. \"Yet for almost a century, the promise of that day was not fulfilled.\"\n\nWarnock said he thought often about what would have happened if the Voting Rights Act had not passed in 1965, if the country had not intervened to enforce the 15th Amendment after it had been ignored for so many years. \"If we had not acted in 1965, what would our country look like?\" he asked his fellow senators. \"Surely, I would not be sitting here. Only the 11th Black senator in the history of our country. And the first Black senator in Georgia. And maybe that's the point.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

The river sharply divides its East and West sides, with a quaint city center astride its banks. For several decades, the headliners at the city's downtown performing arts center's open-air amphitheater, its high school gyms, and its church pulpits have included national politicians seeking the White House.\n\nThat's not uncommon for Iowa, whose caucuses have helped pick presidents of both parties since 1972 . But what distinguishes Waterloo from most other cities and towns in the overwhelmingly white state is its striking diversity, with a sizable community of Black voters who have historically been highly sought after by Democratic campaigns.\n\n\"It's not a large population in other areas\" of the state, says Mayor Quentin Hart, and so candidates have worked hard \"to try to earn the Black vote here.\" In 2019, after months of courting by numerous campaigns, Hart endorsed Pete Buttigeig shortly before the 2020 caucuses-giving him late breaking coverage in both state and national outlets that played against the storyline that he struggled to gain the support of Black voters .\n\nPastor Frantz Whitfield hosted presidential candidates going as far back as Jesse Jackson and Bill Clinton for services at Mt. Carmel Baptist Church. During caucuses, candidates called from their cell phones, requesting speaking time during services. \"We had Beto O'Rourke with us one Sunday morning, and as soon as he walked out, Mayor Bill deBlasio from New York was walking in,\" he says, recalling a day ahead of the 2020 Democratic caucus. In the end, that year Whitfield endorsed then-candidate Joe Biden, who came in fourth place in a contest marred by technical failures .\n\nBiden's campaign was revived three weeks later when he easily carried South Carolina, with its predominantly Black democratic primary electorate. And under Biden's watch, the Democratic Party, citing an interest in uplifting voters in more diverse states , has moved to abandon the Iowa caucus. This year, its presidential nomination contest is officially set to start on February 3rd in South Carolina.\n\nWhitfield and other leaders from Waterloo's Black, blue-collar kingmaking community don't relish that Iowa was dethroned. But while they may no longer be so valued by campaigns, their years in the maelstrom have left them with advice to offer. Some applies to those hoping to engage Black voters elsewhere, including Biden this November, and future Democrats in 2028's open primary. But much of what they've learned-about the value of coordinated advocacy and pushing for local campaign hiring and spending-offers broader lessons to Black communities elsewhere on how to step into their own power when politicians seek votes.\n\nEven if Waterloo's influence has sunset, Whitfield still receives numerous invitations to Washington from the administration. At the 2022 White House Christmas party, he met a pastor who came from South Carolina who said, \"'Well, looks like we're swapping spots this election cycle,'\" Whitfield recounts. \"I said, 'Take full advantage of it. Take full advantage of it.'\"\n\nWaterloo has industrial roots, and the history of its Black community lies in the laborers who were brought in by train, many from the Deep South, in the midst of a 1910 strike by white workers . Today, Black residents make up roughly 17 percent of Waterloo's 67,000 residents-a significant share in a state where African Americans constitute less than 4 percent of the overall population .\n\nWhile the city is cherished by those who call it home, it can be a hard place: a 2018 report ranked Waterloo as the worst place for Black people to live in the United States, citing employment and housing discrimination. The city remains largely segregated, with the Black community rooted east of the Cedar, where the Southern strikebreakers made their homes generations ago. Democratic presidential candidates passing through would sometimes hold one event in East Waterloo and another in West Waterloo on the same day, given the sharp divide.\n\nIowa's leaders at all levels are acutely aware of the caucuses' role as a significant money maker ; the Des Moines-Ames area alone received upwards of $100 million in television ads in 2020. Advocates in Waterloo are no exception, and Deidre DeJear, who in 2022 became the first African American nominated by Iowa Democrats for governor , says where and how the campaign opens its wallet matters.\n\n\"They get an opportunity to hire community members that are in those communities. They get an opportunity to invest dollars, whether it be having office space...the local radio and the local television station that we know those community members are listening to and watching,\" she explains.\n\nThe Democrats' standard Iowa caucus playbook involved parachuting in hordes of twenty-something organizers from big cities and college towns outside the Hawkeye State. I was one of them in Waterloo ahead of the 2020 primaries, working for Kamala Harris. Residents could spot campaign interlopers like me by how we pronounced the city's name: like the ABBA song, with a downward trail; Locals emphasize the closing \"-loo\" at the end, raising their tone as they call home. Water loo .\n\nDuring the caucuses' reign, East Waterloo-Black Waterloo-got its share of surface-level drop-by visits. \"They'll do a sweep visually, where press is engaged,\" says DeJear. Over time, Waterloo's Black leaders pressed, with some success, for deeper investment and engagement, including by demanding that campaign jobs instead go to people from Waterloo. \"What happened to the young people in our community that are able to knock doors, able to work on these campaigns, and be paid to do it?\" asks Mayor Hart.\n\nRyan Stevenson, an East Waterloo native, says he \"didn't grow up seeing yard signs\" or \"getting literature and mailers.\" But he was hired at 31 to organize for Cory Booker ahead of the 2020 caucuses. He credits his bosses with allowing him \"to be creative in that position, and not just do typical organizing stuff,\" he says, as he built relationships volunteering at the food bank, or at the House of Hope, a transitional housing center. \"We were there,\" he says, \"organizing people to move on issues. I [wanted to build] something that would move my community forward.\"\n\n\"My family lives in the same neighborhood we've always lived in. On my grandmother's block, everybody has lived there for like 50 years. So, if I'm working for a candidate, I can pull up, take a yard sign, and put it in every yard up and down the street. Just because [my neighbors] support me and are with me,\" Stevenson says.\n\nStevenson's hiring created a career pathway for him, a local Black resident, to work in politics-an opportunity campaigns often extend to college students or interns able to afford no or low pay. It also left a foundation for local Black political empowerment that outlasted the presidential election.\n\n\"We all know how campaigns are, right? They build up these massive programs and systems, and then once the election is over, it's over,\" Stevenson says. \"I wanted to be there and build. It eventually set me up to do other things within the community.\" He went on to lead a grassroots movement rooted in East Waterloo that successfully pushed police to drop a logo resembling a KKK symbol. Soon after, he'd manage a 2021 campaign for city council for Nia Wilder, a former host on KBBG , Waterloo's Black radio station. Her victory helped to secure the first majority-Black council in Waterloo history -all within a year of Stevenson's stint with Booker.\n\nDemocratic campaigns are often criticized for shallow encounters and pandering missteps with Black voters: a photo opp at the local soul food joint, or a pit stop at a Black church. The deeper investments eventually gained in Waterloo, including hirings like Stevenson's, weren't offered easily. They came from community leaders working with one another to challenge campaigns to do better.\n\n\"You have a lot of people that come into your community,\" says Mayor Hart, \"and then the question is, after they come into the community to earn your support, how do you maximize that relationship?\" For places that find themselves courted like Waterloo once was, he recommends launching a \"coordinated conversation [among leaders] about what matters most and what creates real community change\" before the candidates come. \"These folks can't offer the world, but [you] need to find somebody that's willing to listen,\" he says.\n\nCouncilmember Wilder agrees: \"Before anything happens with anyone coming into your city wanting to do anything, meet as a community first, so that you can understand where you all align.\"\n\nLatanya Graves, president of the Black Hawk County NAACP says that without local leaders flexing their muscles, the campaign process can be formulaic. \"They come in with a laundry list and say, 'Well, I'm going to do this, and I'm going to change that, and I've already drafted my plans to put this in place.' And people are looking at them, like 'Well what about my issues?' A lot of times, our issues fall by the wayside.\"\n\nWaterloo's black leaders think such coordination could have gotten their community more if it had started earlier. But in addition to some success securing local job opportunities, they say their efforts did help elevate their city's profile; in 2019, Waterloo hosted a presidential forum on local and urban issues sponsored by the US Conference of Mayors.\n\nWith some 2024 polling revealing shrinking enthusiasm for President Biden's reelection among Black voters , Waterloo's recent history offers a clear warning of the risks of a prominent white Democrat neglecting outreach to Black voters. In the Democrats' 2016 presidential primary contest, Pastor Whitfield was an early endorser of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. But as caucus season continued and Bernie Sanders picked up steam, he and other Black community leaders approached the Clinton campaign to urge deeper engagement in Waterloo. When they saw no change, Whitfield switched his endorsement.\n\nClinton's team thought they had it \"in the bag, that they were already going to win Waterloo and Black Hawk County,\" Whitfield recounts. \"They felt like they really didn't need to connect with any of the leaders here. They didn't take [our] advice.\" Come caucus night, Bernie Sanders carried the area .\n\nThe story had been entirely different in 2007, when candidate Barack Obama held a rally in Waterloo on the very same February day that he announced his presidential candidacy, not so far away in Springfield, Illinois. On caucus night, the county gave him almost as much support as Hillary Clinton and John Edwards, the two runners-up, combined. In a return 2012 visit, he flattered a crowd of 2,000 attendees , telling them \"it was in your backyards where our movement for change began.\"\n\n\"It shows our value, having that [campaign visit] the same day that he launched in his home state,\" says Mayor Hart. While national media narratives focused on the extent Obama's Iowa 2008 victory showed he could win over white voters, on caucus night, most ignored its roots in Waterloo, and the Black voters who buoyed him there-and whose strong support would go on to deliver him the nomination and White House. \"Our support is important-whether candidates appreciate it, or believe it, or not,\" says Graves.\n\nAs the Democrats' primary calendar moves to new territory, Black voters in South Carolina and the candidates seeking their support have a chance to demonstrate an authentic and constructive commitment to building the party's Black voter base in a way that lasts beyond election day. As primary schedules change, Waterloo knows that politicians come and go. For the Black communities they visit, Stevenson has a reminder: \"At the end of the day, this is gonna be y'all home.\"\n\nTop image: Mother Jones illustration; Alex Wong/Getty; Win McNamee/Getty; Paul Boucher/ZUMA; Jack Kurtz/ZUMA; Al Drago/CQ Roll Call/ZUMA\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Get-Out-the-Vote Campaigns Use Black Lives Matter Language to Boost Turnout\n\nAlbin Lohr-Jones/Pacific Press via ZUMA Wire\n\nWith the election one day away, it's already clear that black voter turnout won't reach the historic highs it set when Barack Obama was on the ballot. Early voting numbers show that fewer African Americans have cast ballots in key battleground states like North Carolina than in the past two presidential elections.  Recent incidents of police violence against African Americans have done little to help, deepening the distrust of the state and disillusionment with political leaders among some supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement. And while Donald Trump has actively alienated black voters with his rhetoric , black activists have also criticized Hillary Clinton for backing the tough-on-crime policies in the 1990s that contributed to mass incarceration.\n\nBut several initiatives are trying to get African Americans to the polls by using the very language of this movement-despite its skepticism of politicians-arguing that even if some voters are unenthusiastic about the presidential race, the vote is a necessary part of building black political power and holding elected officials accountable at every level of government.\n\nTaylor Campbell, campaign manager of #WeBuiltThis , a digital get-out-the-vote initiative focused on boosting black millennial turnout, says the campaign has tried to spread the message that voting is \"an important part of our toolbox of organizing towards black liberation.\" #WeBuiltThis, launched last month, has worked to reach young black voters through social media, visual messaging campaigns, and op-eds written by young black organizers on websites like the Huffington Post and The Root .\n\n\"A lot of times when folks want to engage black millennials, the way they engage is around the [presidential] election,\" Campbell says. \"We're not talking about Hillary or Trump. We're talking about the work that can be done, specifically at the state and local level, to effect change and to improve the material conditions of black life.\"\n\nPredicting the voting behavior of black millennials this year has been a challenge. Although Clinton is expected to win the overwhelming majority of the black vote, younger African Americans have been wary of her candidacy. That skepticism has fueled concerns that black turnout will be significantly lower than in 2008 or 2012-perhaps an unfair benchmark, given the enthusiasm Obama engendered. But at the same time, racial justice has moved into the spotlight as Black Lives Matter has created new outlets for black political engagement by sparking a national conversation about the role the government should play in matters of race and policing.\n\nThose are the very issues that #WeBuiltThis and similar campaigns have highlighted, noting that voting is a way to hold politicians accountable on a wide array of issues important to black voters, from criminal justice reform to political negligence in the Flint water crisis. \"There may not be excitement about politics and offices, but they understand that they have to be in the streets and the voting booth in numbers,\" says Judith Browne Dianis, executive director of the Advancement Project, a civil rights organization that assisted with the development of the #WeBuiltThis campaign.\n\nBlack activists have become a particularly powerful force in local politics. Earlier this year, frustration over the delayed indictment of the police officer who shot Laquan McDonald in Chicago led to the activist-driven #ByeAnita campaign , helping to oust Cook County state's attorney Anita Alvarez. In Cuyahoga County, Ohio, black organizers successfully denied re-election to the district attorney who failed to bring charges against the officer responsible for the death of 12-year-old Tamir Rice.\n\nThat's the type of change Color of Change PAC Director Arisha Hatch wants to see on Election Day. In September, Color of Change PAC , the political arm of a prominent online racial justice group, began organizing Black Battleground Text-a-Thons in cities across the country, culminating in the launch of its #VotingWhileBlack voter mobilization effort last month. \"We're trying to prove that if engaged, black voters will turn out to vote regardless of if Barack Obama is on the ballot, or regardless of whether there is a presidential race,\" Hatch says. Volunteers with the initiative have sent more than one million text messages to voters in battleground states. In the final weekend before Election Day, the campaign hopes to reach an additional one million people.\n\nWhereas Color of Change PAC has emphasized the importance of local and state races, the nation's first black president has focused largely on the presidential contest. During a Thursday speech in Florida, Obama aimed much of his message at young black voters, telling them that by going to the polls they \"can bend the arc of history in a better direction.\" Older black organizations like the Congressional Black Caucus have framed voting as a necessary responsibility for black youth, often referring to the battle for the vote during the Civil Rights Movement as proof of their obligation.\n\nBut that approach might be limited in its effectiveness. \"The classic argument that 'our ancestors fought and died for the right to vote' isn't enough and doesn't wash with millennials,\" says Dominique Apollon, research director of RaceForward, a group focused on finding innovative methods of advancing racial justice. He says that older civil rights groups would be wise to acknowledge the disillusionment young black voters feel. After the shootings of many unarmed black men and women, he says, some young people \"feel that they are in a state of emergency.\" Over the summer, RaceForward conducted focus groups with young black activists in an effort to understand their perspective on voting. They found that while black millennials lacked enthusiasm about the presidential election, they were interested in local races, and it was easier to engage them with local politics.\n\nThe activists of the movement surrounding Black Lives Matter have frequently accused politicians of contributing to the recent crises and of being incapable of producing real change. But in the final weeks before the election, several well-known black activists, including DeRay Mckesson and Brittany Packnett of Campaign Zero, issued endorsements of Clinton, arguing that she would be better than Trump in protecting black lives. The get-out-the-vote campaigns have not endorsed a presidential candidate, but they similarly make the case that voting can be a path to achieving the movement's goals.\n\n\"Black voters see the struggle, and we understand what currently is at stake in our lives and our communities,\" says Dianis. \"We can use the ballot box as the next way to build power.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Republicans Are Erasing Decades of Voting Rights Gains Before Our Eyes\n\nTop state North Carolina redistricting legislators, Sen. Ralph Hise, top left, and Rep. Destin Hall, top right, listen as several dozen members of the public address state lawmakers during a public comment hearing on Senate and House legislative redistricting maps, Oct. 25, 2021 at the Legislative Building in Raleigh. Travis Long/The News & Observer/AP\n\nOn Wednesday, Republicans blocked a vote on the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to restore the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The Supreme Court's gutting of the landmark voting rights law in 2013-and the lack of congressional action to fix it-means that the current redistricting cycle is the first in more than 50 years where states with a long history of discrimination do not have to approve their voting maps with the federal government.\n\nVoting rights advocates are urgently warning that the absence of federal voting rights protections is having a devastating impact on representation for communities of color, erasing decades of hard-fought gains for once-disenfranchised groups and preventing fast-changing demographics from leading to a shift in political power, particularly in the South.\n\n\"Not to be melodramatic, but the South is burning,\" says Allison Riggs, co-executive director of the North Carolina-based Southern Coalition for Social Justice, which is heavily involved with redistricting and voting rights in the South. \"What we're seeing is beyond our worst nightmares in terms of how bad these processes and outcomes are for voters of color.\"\n\nOn Thursday, North Carolina's GOP-controlled legislature approved new maps for the US House that will likely give white Republicans control of 10 or 11 districts out of 14 total in a state Donald Trump carried with just 49.9 percent of the vote in 2020. Democrats will control just three safe seats, with voters of color, who comprised 90 percent of the state's population growth over the past decade, packed into urban areas like Charlotte and the Research Triangle. The state's three largest, heavily Democratic counties-Wake, Mecklenburg, and Guilford-will each be split into three different congressional districts to dilute the power of communities of color and enhance the power of white rural areas.\n\nThe only tossup seat is held by a Black Democrat, G.K. Butterfield, who Republicans targeted by adding white voters to his eastern North Carolina district and removing Black ones, changing it from a seat Biden carried by nine points to one that leans Democratic by just two points. The district has long been protected by the VRA (the Supreme Court found that it had been illegally gerrymandered by Republicans in 2011) and diluting the Black vote to oust Butterfield \"would have never passed muster under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act,\" Riggs said. House Republicans added Butterfield to their 2022 target list after GOP victories in Virginia on Tuesday.\n\nThe congressional, state senate, and state house maps-all approved by the legislature on Thursday-each received an F for partisan fairness from the Princeton Gerrymandering Project, which said that all three maps were likely to decrease the number of districts where communities of color can elect their preferred candidates. The maps will go into effect immediately because North Carolina's Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper cannot veto them.\n\nThe biggest losses for communities of color are likely to be felt at the local level, where redistricting plans rarely face intense public scrutiny.\n\nIn 1989, Robert Reives Sr., working with the NAACP, helped file a lawsuit that led to him becoming the first Black county commissioner elected in Lee County, North Carolina, named after Confederate leader Robert E. Lee, 45 miles southwest of Raleigh.\n\nFor 30 years Reives has been a pillar of the community, awarded the state's highest honor for public service in December 2020, with a son serving in the state legislature. For most of that time he was the only Black member of the county commission.\n\nFor weeks this fall Lee County had been considering redistricting plans that preserved Black representation, so Reives was shocked when he walked into a commission meeting on October 4 and found a new plan sitting on his chair, requested by a GOP member of the commission with no public scrutiny or advance notice, that added nearly 700 voters from overwhelmingly Republican and rural parts of the county, leading white voters to outnumber Black ones in Reives' district for the first time since it was created.\n\n\"I immediately knew that it appeared to be gerrymandering to me,\" Reives told me. \"When I finally looked at the numbers, I knew right away this would not provide any support or advantage for me in district 1.\" Reives had always represented the center of Sanford, the county seat, but the new voters came from the deeply red countryside, which had little in common with his urban district. \"When you have a couple of miles or more and all you see are Republican signs and Trump flags, I don't get the feeling that my signs are going to matter in that area,\" he said.\n\nHe offered to compromise and accept half of the voters Republicans wanted to move in, but was rebuffed by the 4-3 GOP majority. The plan passed two weeks later. \"The end game is to try to put Mr. Reives out in the next election,\" Democratic Commissioner Cameron Sharpe said at a county commission meeting on October 18. \"It is glaringly evident. And I think it is a shame, it's morally and ethically wrong.\"\n\nIt took decades of organizing and litigation to elect Black officials in places like Lee County following the passage of the VRA in 1965, but without the law's strong protections, people like Reives could find their districts wiped out in the next election.\n\nWhereas before the Justice Department or a federal court would have had to approve new redistricting plans from the likes of Lee County and would have very likely rejected them if Black voting strength was diluted, under a weakened VRA voting rights organizations can only file litigation after the fact, in cases that take years to adjudicate while elections are held under discriminatory maps.\n\n\"There's not enough resources to cover every district that used to be covered under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act,\" says Riggs. \" We're going to see a huge loss of representation, particularly at the local level, in 2022 because there aren't enough voting rights attorneys to litigate all these cases.\"\n\nNorth Carolina was the epicenter of the fight over gerrymandering over the last decade, with its congressional and state legislative maps drawn by GOP gerrymandering guru Tom Hofeller, who passed away in 2018. Hofeller said he was instructed by North Carolina Republicans \"to minimize the number of districts in which Democrats would have an opportunity to elect a Democratic candidate.\" Democrats held a 7-6 advantage in North Carolina's congressional delegation even after the Tea Party wave of 2010, but the maps Hofeller drew in 2011 gave Republicans 10 of 13 districts after redistricting occurred.\n\nDistricts drawn by Hofeller that segregated Black voters into just two seats to dilute their voting strength statewide were struck down by the Supreme Court in 2017 as illegal racial gerrymandering . Hofeller then drew another 10-3 Republican map using political data instead of racial data. \"I propose that we draw the maps to give a partisan advantage to 10 Republicans and three Democrats, because I do not believe it's possible to draw a map with 11 Republicans and two Democrats,\" GOP state Rep. David Lewis, who oversaw the redistricting process, bluntly admitted. (Lewis pled guilty in 2020 to using donor funds for personal use.)\n\nHofeller's new maps were struck down in state court in 2019 as an illegal partisan gerrymander , meaning that elections were held in North Carolina under unconstitutional maps for nearly the entire decade. Now Republicans are doing the very thing-creating 10 or 11 districts for Republicans by weakening the voting strength of communities of color-that the courts told them repeatedly not to do during the past decade.\n\n\"They've made the determination that what worked for them in 2011 can work for them again in 2021, and without the constraints of the Voting Rights Act they feel essentially unbound,\" says former Obama administration attorney general Eric Holder, who founded the National Democratic Redistricting Committee in 2017 to challenge Republican gerrymandering efforts.\n\nRepublicans are hoping to get away with it this time by claiming they drew the maps \" race-blind \" and never considered the voting numbers of communities of color. This argument was pioneered by Texas Republicans , who passed congressional and state legislative maps last month that increased the number of districts where white voters are a majority of eligible voters and decreased the number of districts where communities of color are in the majority, even though whites comprise only 40 percent of Texas' population and 95 percent of population growth in the past decade came from communities of color.\n\n\"I've stated it, and I'll state it again-we drew these maps race blind,\" said Republican state Sen. Joan Huffman , who oversaw the redistricting process in the Texas state Senate.\n\nRepublicans in North Carolina adopted the same argument . \"I will say that we have not looked at any partisan data in drawing this map, nor have we looked at racial data,\" said North Carolina GOP state Sen. Ralph Hise, who drew the congressional and state senate maps.\n\nIn 2019, the Supreme Court-in a case challenging the gerrymandered congressional districts drawn by Hofeller-said that maps drawn for a partisan advantage cannot be challenged in federal court , but racial gerrymandering cases can still be heard, so the goal of GOP lawmakers seems to be to disclaim any use of race-while surgically limiting representation for communities of color-so their maps can't be struck down in court.\n\n\"They are fully aware that the people most negatively affected by the voter suppression bills they've passed and the gerrymandering they've engaged in are people of color,\" says Holder.\n\nRiggs said it's laughable that Republicans claim they never considered race when drawing new maps given how the districts drawn by Republicans in states like Texas and North Carolina entrench white GOP power at the expense of communities of color. It's also impossible to comply with the Voting Rights Act without considering how new maps affect minority voters. Riggs' group has already filed suit against North Carolina's legislature for failing to consider race.\n\nThis new form of extreme gerrymandering is exactly why voting rights advocates say Congress needs to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act that would restore the Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act that would ban partisan gerrymandering.\n\n\"We need the John Lewis Act now and we need the Freedom to Vote Act so folks can't just hide behind partisan gerrymandering to advance their racially discriminatory intent,\" says Riggs. \"It's such an emergency and the failure of Congress to act already is killing us.\"\n\nOf course, extreme gerrymandering isn't limited to states with a long history of discrimination. Ohio Republicans recently introduced a congressional map that would give them 86 percent of seats in a state Trump won with 53 percent of the vote, flagrantly ignoring a ballot initiative passed by voters in 2018 designed to create a fairer redistricting process . Wisconsin Republicans are set to pass a congressional map in the coming days that would give them 75 percent of seats in a state Biden won. (Democrats have also unveiled heavily gerrymandered maps in blue states like Illinois, but oversee the redistricting process in fewer places than Republicans and have ceded power to independent redistricting commissions in states like Colorado and Virginia.)\n\nGOP rushing to pass extreme gerrymandered US House maps:\n\n-Rs would hold 86% of seats in OH where Trump got 53%\n\n-71-78% of seats in NC where Trump got 49.9%\n\n-75% of seats in WI where Trump got 49%\n\n-65% of seats in TX where Trump got 52%\n\nDems running out of time to stop it\n\n- Ari Berman (@AriBerman) November 4, 2021\n\nWhile Democrats have yet to overcome four GOP filibusters to pass voting rights legislation and continue to squabble over Biden's economic bills, Republicans are passing skewed maps and undermining fair elections in a way that rigs the political system in their favor seemingly every day.\n\n\"The American experiment is at risk,\" says Holder. \"This is the biggest challenge to American democracy-the insurrection, the gerrymandering, the voter suppression, the attacks on professional election officials-all of this puts our democracy at risk to a degree we have not seen since the Civil War. That's how serious this is.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Trump Is Trying to Woo Black Voters by Saying What He Always Says\n\nJohn Bazemore/AP\n\nThe election is one year away, the impeachment inquiry is heating up, and Donald Trump wants those black votes. On Friday, the president went to Atlanta for the launch of Black Voices for Trump. The new grassroots coalition is an attempt by Trump's reelection campaign to win over more black voters than he did in 2016.\n\nGood luck with that.\n\nThough this was supposed to be a rally to announce a new black coalition, it was a standard Trump rally. Trump took shots at Nancy Pelosi and the Democratic Party. He called members of the press the \"fake news media.\" He touted all the things he sees as accomplishments for the African American community, like a lower unemployment rate and the First Step Act , a bill that curbs mandatory minimum sentences and allows inmates to petition for quicker release but has come under its own share of criticism. He also accused immigrants of taking jobs from black people. And of course he complained about the Russia investigation and the impeachment process.\n\nThe festivities in Atlanta got started early, with black Trump supporters lined up and decked out in their Blacks for Trump tees.\n\nThe Florida-based group Blacks for Trump traveled to Atlanta today to support @realDonaldTrump 's launch of the \"Black Voices for Trump\" coalition. pic.twitter.com/C2cejZS5zk\n\n- Nicquel Terry Ellis (@NTerryEllis) November 8, 2019\n\nThe shirts were obviously a big hit! (The women behind this white couple seem just as confused as the rest of us.)\n\nOh this \"Blacks For #Trump \" rally in #Atlanta is already off to a comedic start! 🤦🏾‍♂️😩 pic.twitter.com/g0qFZO7QwD\n\n- Isaac Hayes III (@IsaacHayes3) November 8, 2019\n\nAfter being introduced by Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson, Trump asked the crowd which term they preferred, \"black\" or \"African American.\" The crowd began chanting \"Blacks for Trump! Blacks for Trump!\" much to the president's delight. He also reminded the crowd, \"People forget, Abraham Lincoln was a Republican!\"\n\nIt's unclear how this will bring new black voters to his side. They care about the same things other progressive voters care about. They want climate action, anti-racist policies, and a fairer tax system. And those things are anathema to Trump.\n\nAnd despite the dozens of retweets of the Trump campaign's account from black supporters, the president is deeply unpopular in the black community. In 2016, Trump got 8 percent of the black vote. At the rally, he said African Americans were joining his side \"in record numbers,\" but his approval ratings among black voters hovers around the teens, depending on how far out he is from saying something racist on Twitter.\n\nIf you've been paying even a modicum of attention since Trump first walked onto the political stage, those low numbers aren't surprising. Trump launched his political career by propagating the lie that Barack Obama was a secret Muslim born in Kenya. He became one of the loudest birthers demanding that Obama provide his birth certificate and school records. In 2017, after white nationalists descended on Charlottesville, Virginia, and one killed Heather Heyer after plowing his car into a crowd of protesters, Trump said that there were \" very fine people \" on both sides. He also reportedly referred to Haiti and African countries as \"shithole countries.\" In 2019 alone, Trump suggested four brown and black congresswoman \"go back\" to their countries , despite the fact that three of the four were born in the United States; called Baltimore, which is part of the late Elijah Cummings' congressional district, \" rat infested \" after Cummings criticized the Department of Homeland Security for poor conditions in immigrant detention centers; and compared the impeachment inquiry process to lynching .\n\nIf Trump was serious about bringing new black voters into the fold, he'd have to offer them something different from his usual rants. Or maybe he's just hoping black people will simply forget the last three years.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "The 200-Year History of Using Voter Fraud Fears to Block Access to the Ballot\n\nRui Vieira/PA Wire/AP Images\n\nIt seemed inevitable after evidence of voting irregularities appeared in the contested race in North Carolina's 9th Congressional District: Republicans used the problems to push for tighter voting laws last month. Voting restrictions in the name of fraud prevention have been at the forefront of Donald Trump's presidency ever since he claimed in the wake of his election that millions of fraudulent votes had been cast against him and he created a commission to investigate voter fraud. (Never mind that the commission failed to document any evidence of widespread fraud, or that North Carolina's issues appeared to stem from impropriety on the part of the Republican candidate's campaign, not voters.)\n\nBut raising fears of fraud in order to make it harder for people-particularly people fitting certain demographic profiles-to vote didn't start with this administration, or even in the past 100 years. As Harvard University historian Alexander Keyssar lays out in his 2000 book, The Right to Vote: The Contested History of Democracy in the United States , the tactic dates back to the early decades of the 19th century. Throughout US history, politicians and activists ginned up stories about fraud in order to keep their opponents from the polls. \"Legislative debates were sprinkled heavily with tales of ballot box stuffing, miscounts, hordes of immigrants lined up to vote as the machine instructed, men trooping from precinct to precinct to vote early and often,\" he writes.\n\nThe most pervasive fraud that was actually occurring in the late 19th century was in the South, where African Americans were denied the right to vote through vigilante violence and ballot manipulation. \"We are a majority here,\" a black man from Georgia testified to the Senate in 1883, \"but you may vote till your eyes drop out or your tongue drops out, and you can't count your colored man in out of them boxes; there's a hole gets in the bottom of the boxes some way and lets out our votes.\" The unfolding scandal in North Carolina, where it appears African American voters were the victims, \"certainly fits with the long tradition with trying to suppress the black vote in the South,\" Keyssar tells Mother Jones .\n\nIn the late 19th century, white Southerners began to realize that the easiest way to disenfranchise African Americans was through legal means like poll taxes and literacy tests. Meanwhile, fear of widespread voter fraud prompted restrictions on voting around the country, often employed to hinder immigrants, minorities, and poor and working-class voters. Here's an incomplete timeline of using the specter of fraud to deny people the vote:\n\n1836: Pennsylvania passed its first voter registration law. The law applied only to Philadelphia, where it required assessors to go door-to-door to compile a list of eligible voters. To cast a ballot, a voter had to be on the list. \"Although the proclaimed goal of the law was to reduce fraud, opponents insisted that its real intent was to reduce the participation of the poor-who were frequently not home when the assessors came by and did not have 'big brass' nameplates on their doors,\" Keyssar writes.\n\n1866: California passed a restrictive registration requirement aimed at quelling fears about voter fraud committed by immigrants. Democrats considered it \"an act of hostility to the Democratic party.\" To register, naturalized citizens had to present to the county clerk their \"original, court-sealed naturalization papers,\" Keyssar explains. \"In the absence of such papers, an immigrant's eligibility could be established only through the testimony of two 'householders and legal voters' and by residence in the state for a full year, double the normal requirement.\" The deadline to register was three months before the general election.\n\n1866-1867: New Jersey Republicans erected a series of hurdles under the pretense of fighting fraud. Everyone who wished to cast a ballot had to register in person the Thursday before each general election; anyone could challenge the credentials of a would-be registrant; and anyone not on the list on Election Day could not vote. Democrats protested that the laws discriminated against the poor, who couldn't take time off work to register. These registration laws varied in the ensuing decades, with Democrats repealing them when in power and Republicans reinstating them upon taking control. Republicans also passed laws to close the polls at sunset, based on the assumption that illegal votes would be cast after dark. Democrats countered that these \"sunset laws\" blocked workers from voting.\n\nEarly 1880s: Chicago's elite, losing power to Democratic politicians, began to advocate reforms to \"preserve the purity of the ballot box,\" including a burdensome registration system. At the same time, they set out to discover evidence of fraud to boost their reform agenda. They hired investigators to monitor polling locations and offered a $300 reward to anyone who helped \"in the apprehension and conviction of anyone who voted illegally in Chicago in 1883.\" The allegedly illegal voters the effort produced were acquitted in court.\n\n1885: D espite a lack of evidence of fraud, Illinois enacted a new voter registration system drafted by the state's elites. Under these reforms, voters in some cities were required to register in person on the third or fourth Tuesday before a general election. Election clerks, accompanied by the police, would then conduct a house-by-house canvass of every would-be voter and create a \"suspect list\" of anyone potentially registered improperly. Anyone on this suspect list would not be eligible to vote unless he appeared on the Tuesday two weeks prior to a general election with convincing evidence of his eligibility. This entire process would be repeated every four years. The Chicago elites celebrated that \"the foundations for honest elections were now firmly laid.\"\n\n1911: New Jersey, in a Progressive Era effort to squash corruption, erected major hurdles to voter registration, but only in cities of more than 5,000 people. Whenever a voter moved or sat out an election, he had to re-register. Registration was available only four days per year, and the registration process required a prospective voter to list his occupation and the names of his spouse, parents, and landlord, as well as \"a satisfactory description of the dwelling in which he lived,\" as Keyssar describes it. Turnout plummeted, especially among African Americans and immigrants.\n\nMid-late-20th century: Voter purges and administrative barriers to registration persisted, contributing to chronically low turnout in the United States compared to other Western democracies. When voting rights advocates successfully pressed Congress to pass a bill to relax registration rules in 1992, former President George H.W. Bush vetoed it, calling the bill \"an open invitation to fraud and corruption.\"\n\n2010-present: Republicans who took control of state governments across the country after the 2010 elections passed a rash of restrictive voting laws as anti-fraud measures. These reforms included voter identification laws, restrictions on early voting, and requirements that people provide proof of citizenship to register. They have done little to stamp out in-person voter fraud, which is virtually nonexistent. But they do impede voters of color, the poor, the elderly, and young people from casting ballots. A federal appeals court found in 2016 that North Carolina's voter ID requirements \"target African Americans with almost surgical precision.\" A federal court in Texas ruled in 2017 that the state's voter ID law, passed under the pretense of fraud deterrence, purposefully discriminated against African Americans and Latinos.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Republicans Tried to Suppress the Black Vote in North Carolina. It's Not Working.\n\nJolanda Smith, a hair salon owner in Fayetteville, North Carolina, is helping Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan get out the vote. Erika Eichelberger\n\n\"The first question I ask my customers is: Are you registered?\" Jolanda Smith says.\n\nSmith runs a hair salon on the outskirts of Fayetteville, North Carolina. Her hair is dyed lavender and her arms are covered in heart and shooting-star tattoos. In the lead-up to the midterms, she's lending her storefront to Democratic Sen. Kay Hagan's reelection campaign. Smith passes out sample ballots and flyers and tells customers how to register and where their polling location is. Last Saturday morning, she was talking God and voting as she straightened a customer's hair.\n\n\"It's: Are you gonna vote, yes or no?\" she says, sectioning off a lock and pulling it through the iron. \"God gave us a choice, and the choices are always yes or no. It's not maybe. It's not, 'Let me think about it,' 'cause those are excuses...On down from choosing Christ to voting. You gonna vote? Yes or no?\"\n\nIN 2013, North Carolina Republicans , led by Hagan's opponent, state house speaker Thom Tillis, passed a far-reaching voting law that curtails early voting and eliminates same-day registration. The Justice Department sued North Carolina over the law, charging it was discriminatory and would depress minority turnout.\n\nHagan's campaign knows that black voter turnout could decide her fate-and, by extension, determine which party controls the Senate for the final two years of President Barack Obama's term. If African-Americans manage to turn out at presidential-year levels-if they're at least 21 percent of the electorate-Hagan will probably win, says Tom Jensen, director of the North Carolina-based polling firm Public Policy Polling.\n\nThat's why the Hagan campaign, and its coordinated get-out-the-vote organization Forward North Carolina-along with the NAACP, state Democrats, and get-out-the-vote outfits-launched unprecedented efforts this year to mobilize black voters.\n\nThose efforts are paying off. On the first day of early voting last week, 76-year-old Ruben Betts was sitting on the curb in a shopping center parking lot wearing an \"I just voted\" sticker on his sweater. The president reminded him to vote this year, he says: \"Obama sent me a letter.\" As of Thursday, 24 percent of early voters in North Carolina were African-American, according to records from the state board of elections. That's up from just 17 percent at the same point during the last midterm elections in 2010.\n\nThe Hagan field operation, which has 40 offices, 100 staffers, and 10,000 volunteers, is the largest that North Carolina has ever seen in a Senate race. By comparison, the get-out-the-vote campaign for North Carolina Secretary of State Elaine Marshall's failed Senate bid in 2010 was almost entirely run by volunteers. \"We had no money, I mean no money,\" says Thomas Mills, a Democratic political consultant who helped coordinate Marshall's field operation. \"And maybe five paid staffers. The difference in what they've got now-it's just not even same thing. There's no comparison.\"\n\nDemocrats have spent $1 million on ads aired on black radio stations. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee partnered with the Congressional Black Caucus this month to send black lawmakers on a bus tour through North Carolina and five other battleground states. And Hagan's campaign is collaborating extensively with black clergy across the state and roughly 150 black small business owners like Smith who are helping turn out voters this year.\n\nSmith says the main issue that convinces her customers to go to the polls is health insurance. (North Carolina didn't expand Medicaid, so about 500,000 poor North Carolinians are still without insurance.) Jobs top the list, too. Smith's shop sits on Murchison Road, one of the main drags leading out of Fayetteville. The further you drive from the town center, the less money there is-the storefronts become more faded, the sidewalks get weedier, the landscape grayer. \"It's hard to get a job even if you have a degree,\" she says.\n\nSmith adds that anger over the August shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, will also bring people in her community out on Tuesday. \"It was more than just him,\" she notes, referring to the police brutality she witnesses regularly in her community. \"You have some in the system that say, 'I'm gonna hide behind this badge and use it for injustice instead of justice'...To us it feels like it's racist.\"\n\nT-omnis Cox says he feels like a potential Michael Brown. A 23-year-old who works at a chicken plant in eastern North Carolina, he was hanging out in front of a corner liquor store in Goldsboro last Thursday evening. \"It's hard out here in the world,\" he says. \"Every day, we're ducking from cops, we're ducking from law.\" Cox says he's going to vote for Hagan because \"Republicans don't care about the poor.\"\n\nHagan's campaign has also reached out to African-American churches as a key component of its voter mobilization effort, urging pastors around the state to help with voter education and registration.\n\nThe Rev. Dumas Alexander Harshaw Jr. says his church in downtown Raleigh, First Baptist-which was founded by freed slaves-has always been political. This election cycle, the church has been helping voters register, and handing out sample ballots as well as guidelines on how and where to vote. Last Sunday, Harshaw invited Dr. Everett Ward, the president of St. Augustine's University, a historically black college in the city, to speak to the members of First Baptist about voting.\n\n\"We've seen this movie before,\" Ward tells the congregation, referring to the slew of policies Tillis and his fellow Republicans in the state Legislature have enacted since 2012 that disproportionately harm minorities. \"It had the same title in 1895, in 1958, in 1968: 'The South Shall Rise Again.'\" A few amens rise from the pews. If North Carolina sends Tillis to Washington, Ward continues, \"we will lose more opportunity for upward mobility, access to healthcare will disappear, access to higher education will disappear.\"\n\nSo go vote, he says. \"Throughout history...When our people faced discrimination and injustice, we answered the call.\"\n\n\"Will you go?\" Ward asks the congregation, and the chapel fills with \"Yes.\" \"Will you go?\" \"Yes.\"\n\nNot everyone needs to be convinced to exercise their civic duty. \"People died so I might have the right to vote,\" says Mary Bethel, who is lending her Fayetteville storefront to Hagan's ground campaign. Last Friday afternoon, she sat at her desk among stacks of papers, envelopes, Post-its and grandchild photos in her small tax shop on Murchison Road, wearing bright red lipstick and lightly smudged glasses. \"My parents voted til the day they died,\" she adds. \"I grew up in segregation. I vote every election.\"\n\nTillis' record as A leader of the unpopular state Legislature has made it easier for people like Smith and Ward to get black voters to the polls. \"Kay Hagan, to me she's wishy-washy, she's two-faced. But Tillis is an out-out crook,\" says Michael Curtis, a 65-year-old unemployed former construction worker who lives in Raleigh. Democrats haven't done much for Curtis-he's been out of a job since Obama was elected, and says he doesn't have health care-but he's still voting Hagan. Last year, Tillis voted against expanding Medicaid in North Carolina, which would have provided coverage to a half million uninsured North Carolinians. Tillis led a GOP push to cut funding for substance abuse treatment centers by 12 percent. In 2013, he and his fellow Republicans slashed unemployment benefits for 170,000 North Carolinians and eliminated the state's Earned Income Tax Credit, while cutting taxes for rich people. And Tillis backed the harsh voter suppression law , too.\n\nThese bills and others Tillis and fellow Republicans forced through after they took control of both the legislature and the governorship in 2012 led the NAACP's Rev. William Barber to launch the Moral Mondays movement in April 2013. For 74 straight weeks now, protesters have held demonstrations near the state capitol demanding a retreat from the state's sharp right turn.\n\nNow the NAACP is harnessing that anger to get voters to the polls in the most massive mobilization effort the group has ever made in a non-presidential year. Last Thursday, the first day of early voting in the state, the NAACP led 32 marches to the polls-more than in any previous midterm year. Barber's organization is also calling all of the 286,000 African-Americans who voted in 2012 and 2008 but didn't vote in 2010, helping register thousands of new voters , buying radio ads, and reaching out to churches. \"African-Americans need to vote because we're the ones who know the most about voter suppression,\" Barber told Mother Jones .\n\nIf Hagan loses, though, it won't be African-Americans' fault. It will be because too many centrist Democrats voted Republican, Barber says. There are 800,000 more registered Democrats than Republicans in North Carolina, many of whom are white. \"You don't lay the blame of this election on black people.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Inside the intense, person-by-person fight over the Black vote in a key swing state\n\nWATCH LIVE: Journalists and political leaders take part in the 2025 White House Correspondents' Dinner\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nMILWAUKEE - There was no better place to be on Juneteenth in the middle of a campaign that could turn on the Black vote in a pivotal swing state.\n\nIt was stiflingly hot, in the 90s, the heat intensified by dozens of open-air smokers and barbecues that radiated off the pavement. Still, tens of thousands of people of all ages, most of them Black, poured onto MLK Drive for a vibrant parade on Wednesday, then stayed at the adjoining rollicking festival for hours longer.\n\nKimberlee Foster, a volunteer for President Joe Biden's Wisconsin re-election campaign and a longtime Milwaukee resident, stood in the blazing sun with clipboard in hand and announced her main target: people who hadn't voted in the last one or two elections.\n\n\"The people who vote, they don't need us. That's like God don't need all those saints in church,\" Foster said. \"He needs sinners. When you bring in the sinners, you turn them into saints. So that's what we gonna see. We're going to see ones who don't vote. Talk to them about it.\"\n\nAnd that she did. Diving into the crowd again and again for hours, sweat beading on her face and on the people she approached, Foster snagged everyone she could - families, groups of friends, couples, a woman buying an impatient daughter an ice cream cone, a gray-haired man walking alone, a pair of friends enjoying hot roasted corn on the cob - to talk to them about voting for Biden. Then, one way or another, she'd sign them up.\n\nWhen she came upon the \"saints,\" she'd take down their personal information and coax them into organizing themselves.\n\nIn one instance, a college-age man said he had once headed a youth voter group and was trying to launch a new one. Foster gently put her hand behind his elbow, guiding him over to the campaign booth where a team of five to 10 Biden workers moved in and out through the day, and they took it from there.\n\nThe super-volunteer's efforts on this particular day exemplify how the Biden campaign is trying to lock down support of a Black electorate that, in national polls , is starting to show some interest in former President Donald Trump . And this city and state illustrate why it matters so much. While Biden won Wisconsin by less than 1 point in 2020, he actually did worse in many majority-Black Milwaukee neighborhoods than Hillary Clinton had in 2016, when she lost the state to Trump by less than a point.\n\nPersonal conversations like the ones Foster had on Juneteenth are a big part of the Biden campaign's efforts to build up more support. The campaign is specifically targeting Black neighborhoods in Milwaukee, using an organizing tool called the Reach app to map out low-propensity voters and zero in on Black voters who didn't cast ballots in 2022 or 2020.\n\nAfter several hours at the Juneteenth festival , one of the longest-running such events in the country, the Biden campaign said it had engaged with more than 100 people, from new sign-ups to those wanting yard signs and people asking for help registering to vote. It locked in dozens more who committed to take part in organizing events.\n\nConversations with nearly three dozen Black voters here suggested the biggest threat to Biden was not that they'd flee to Trump, with many flagging concerns about his policies. Instead, they raised the prospect of whether - like in 2020 - they just wouldn't show up at the polls. In interviews, they voiced a litany of complaints about their lives in recent years, like the cost of groceries, gas and rent and the persistence of crime.\n\nSeveral people were angry over what they described as the Biden administration's seemingly preferential treatment of migrants while they were struggling financially as working U.S. citizens and weren't getting the help they needed.\n\nMilwaukee resident Ezekiel Johnson, who said he supported Democrats in the past but was still undecided for November, complained that the Biden administration was spending too much money on outside causes.\n\n\"He's worried about what's happening in Ukraine. ... Every day it's another package of money for them,\" Johnson said. \"We need another package of money for us.\"\n\nFor some, the Democrats' organizing presence wasn't enough. Calvin Lee, a lobbyist who was hosting a booth for a not-for-profit organization, said that at a place like the festival, Biden volunteers should have been swarming the crowds.\n\n\"I really don't see the outreach from the Democratic Party. I'd like to see 20 to 50 Biden T-shirts out here today canvassing, handing out pamphlets,\" Lee said, looking around at the throngs of people walking by. \"Where's the real outreach?\"\n\nEven as Lee spoke, Foster was locked in another intense conversation with a Biden supporter who was signing up to help organize.\n\nEarlier, walking in the parade and then visiting festival booths, Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson proudly donned a Biden shirt, which he said clearly sent a message.\n\n\"I know there's a lot of hoopla and the Trump campaign is trying to say things hoping that they come true. But when I come and talk to actual people, actual Black men in this community, they say that they are voting for President Joe Biden - and proudly so,\" Johnson said.\n\nTrump has boasted that he's drawing Black voters from Biden, and in recent rallies he has increasingly tried to make a play for them.\n\nJohnson predicted Trump would be unable to edge into Biden's share of Black voters.\n\n\"He called the most diverse place in the state of Wisconsin - where the vast majority of African Americans live in this state - he called their home 'horrible,' and Joe Biden is making historic investments in our city,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"Enthusiasm to vote among Black voters is the smallest of any of the demographic groups that we look at,\" said Charles Franklin, the chief pollster of the Marquette Law School Poll.\n\nBlack registered voters are about 4% to 6% of the electorate in Wisconsin, and Franklin noted that the relatively small cohort makes it difficult to glean substantive takeaways from polling data.\n\n\"I just don't have enough data to be able to say with any confidence whether Trump really is appealing more to that subset of the Black community,\" Franklin said.\n\nBut when Black voters were asked \"How do you feel about these two candidates?\" according to Franklin, \"Biden is not doing as well as he did four years ago, and Trump is doing a little bit better. I think that's the legitimate warning sign for Biden.\"\n\nThe earlier warning sign for Biden came in 2020, when he won Wisconsin by about 20,000 votes . Clinton, who famously didn't visit Wisconsin during the general election campaign before she lost, won most Black-majority wards in Milwaukee by 1 to 4 points more than Biden did in those areas in 2020, according to data Franklin has collected.\n\nIn 2020, Democrats were supposed to host the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, but that was mostly scuttled because of Covid. While Biden visited the state, he didn't accept his nomination there - he did it instead in Delaware.\n\nBiden himself, as well as Vice President Kamala Harris and first lady Jill Biden, have frequented Wisconsin this year, which numerous people said they appreciated. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore is scheduled to visit Milwaukee this week.\n\nStanding in line at the massively popular Pop's BBQ food truck at the Juneteenth celebration, Milwaukee resident Diane Wynn said she was \"open to him\" when she was asked about Trump. She forgave him for news reports about his calling Milwaukee a \"horrible city,\" which Trump denied. She thought he was referring to crime, and she agreed with that assessment, saying criminals weren't spending enough time behind bars.\n\n\"At first, I was like 'hell no'\" at the thought of backing Trump, Wynn said. \"But maybe we need something different.\"\n\nWynn also complained about benefits flowing to migrants when Black communities were hurting.\n\n\"What are they doing for the middle class?\" she said.\n\nMilwaukee County Executive David Crowley said Democrats need to keep hammering away at messaging to the Black community. He and other Black leaders are convinced that if they just got more of Biden's policy accomplishments in front of people, the choice would then be obvious. That ranges from student loan forgiveness to help the administration has delivered to Black small businesses to low unemployment numbers, he said.\n\n\"There are going to be people who remember receiving that check from Donald Trump but may not understand that they're able to stay within their homes because of the Joe Biden administration,\" Crowley said. \"We can't put it all on the Biden administration and the federal government to tell the story. There are folks like myself, organizations, individuals and businesses that have benefited on the ground, and they are our trusted messengers.\n\n\"We have to do a much better job in general and presidential politics in making sure that we're lifting up those voices in our world,\" he said.\n\nStill, concerns about Trump ran deep. Milwaukee residents brought up what they saw as his economic failings in the area when he was in office. Many of those interviewed said he promoted racism and feared what kind of policies a second term could bring for Blacks.\n\nThough he was undecided, Milwaukee resident Ezekiel Johnson said he wasn't sure he could stomach Trump.\n\n\"He was mad last time he lost. He's a sore loser. He lost fair and square,\" Johnson said. He also brought up Trump's failed promise to bring Foxconn to Racine. \"That s--- was a bust,\" he said.\n\nDarren Reaves, a Navy veteran, said he was on the fence about voting for Trump - until recently.\n\n\"I have no other choice but to vote for Biden. He's not a felon,\" Reaves said.\n\nReaves said he liked that Trump might mix things up in Washington, but he doesn't like the message Trump sends. \"He's promoting racism. He's promoting dissension. He's promoting dislike. He's promoting 'my way or the highway.'\"\n\nStanding tall, a man with a white beard stopped briefly but wouldn't give his name. His vote would be for Biden, he said. Why? He followed a lifelong rule older folks instilled in him since he was a young boy.\n\nIn sizing up politicians, he said, he was always told to \"pick out the one who's not going to reinstate slavery.\" He tapped twice on a reporter's notebook and walked away.\n\nI am a politics reporter covering campaigns and issues affecting voters. I sometimes focus on Midwestern states and Nevada. Right now, I mostly report on the presidential race.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Byron Donalds of Florida and Wesley Hunt of Texas, along with former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson - here on Wednesday for a Black American Business Leader Roundtable.\n\nThe event, at Rocky's Barbershop, a Black-owned business in Atlanta, featured several local business owners, all of whom are men.\n\nAfter each surrogate touted Trump's accomplishments for Black voters to an audience primarily of reporters, Trump himself called in, repeating his often-criticized c laim that his felony convictions have boosted his support among Black Americans.\n\n\"Since that happened, the Black support, I think my representatives will tell you this, the Black support has gone through the roof,\" Trump said. \"I guess they equated to problems that they've had.\"\n\nThe Biden campaign was quick to pounce on what it framed as Trump's \"doubling down\" on a racist stereotype.\n\n\"This might come as news to Trump, but Black and Latino voters want nothing to do with his racist stereotypes, and they know better than to buy into his lazy, shameful attempts at 'outreach,'\" Biden campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said.\n\nAfter the event, Rocky Jones, the venue's owner, would not say whether either Trump or his Black surrogates' message was convincing enough to get his support this November.\n\n\"I am looking into it. I just want to hear both sides of the story, then I'll make my decision,\" Jones said. \"I just want to do what's right. I want to vote for the person that's going to help me and help the community.\"\n\nOn Wednesday evening, Donalds and Hunt are taking their \"Congress, Cognac and Cigars\" tour to Fairburn, roughly 20 miles south of Atlanta, after a previous stop in Philadelphia.\n\nThe intent of the event, according to organizers, is to facilitate \"a real conversation about the Black male vote, leadership and how they will impact the 2024 election.\"\n\nEfforts by Trump and his allies to pursue Black voters, with a focus on men, accelerated this month with the launch of his campaign's Black voter coalition group and a series of events to attract voters of color in Detroit and Philadelphia.\n\nThough Republicans remain hopeful that their efforts will translate into Trump's picking up a larger share of the Black vote in states like Georgia, some Democrats remain skeptical.\n\nAdrianne Shropshire, the executive director of BlackPAC, said focus groups conducted by the group of Black voters in battleground states have not suggested a significant increase in support for Trump and accused his campaign of creating that narrative \"out of thin air.\"\n\n\"It's for him to be able to create this story about how much Black voters love him and then at the end of the day, when Black voters actually do not show up for him, they can be outraged about voter fraud or whatever they're going to claim is the reason why he loses,\" Shropshire said.\n\nAtlanta-based Republican organizer Michaelah Montgomery, whose group, Conserve the Culture, has been working to boost Black support for Trump, disagreed, arguing outreach events by Trump are crucial and create \"community\" for newer Black conservatives who remain hesitant to voice their support for him.\n\n\"It's important for Black conservatives to know that they have a community. Unfortunately, a lot of Black people feel like if they are conservative or leaning conservative they have to be quiet about who they're supporting because it wouldn't align with societal norms.\"\n\nThe Atlanta outreach efforts are not entirely surprising: According to Georgia's secretary of state, Black voters are the second-largest voting bloc in the state, making up roughly 30% of Georgia's active voters .\n\nBut though Black voters in the state vote overwhelmingly for Democrats, pro-Biden organizers, too, are holding outreach events, aiming not to \"leave any Black vote on the table in November.\"\n\n\"It's one of the more outsized demographic groups, in terms of the power that Black voters will have, in deciding, again, not only who will be president, but also speaker of the House,\" said Quentin James, the founder and CEO of the Collective PAC, the largest political action committee supporting Black candidates in the country.\n\nThe group endorsed Biden alongside organizations representing Latino and Asian American voters when he visited the state in March.\n\nThe Collective PAC, alongside several other organizations, including 100 Black Men of America, plans to hold panels both before and after the debate Thursday that will feature Black political commentators, politicians and business owners speaking directly to voters \"about the real-world implications of the debate material covered.\"\n\nOn-site staffers will also be available to assist attendees who have not yet registered to vote, a critical component of the event.\n\n\"We estimate there're over 800,000 eligible yet not registered African Americans in Georgia,\" James said. \"So there's an opportunity to engage the folks who are not registered.\"\n\nMeanwhile, another progressive group, the New Georgia Project Action Fund, plans to launch its Black male relational organizing campaign during its debate watch party in Atlanta, aiming to engage specifically with a cohort of voters it says are often \"left out of the conversation.\"\n\n\"Black men are blamed after an election if the results didn't go the way people hoped they would go, and they are scrutinized for whether and how they show up,\" said Simran Jadavji, a spokesperson for the New Georgia Project Action Fund. \"But in the actual conversation, in the many, many months and years leading up to election cycles, they're not engaged in this way.\"\n\nPeople at the event, which is scheduled to take part at a cigar lounge, will be provided with various texts about issues organizers say are pertinent to Black voters, including affordable housing, job creation and wage increases. Should either Trump or Biden address those issues, the hope is that attendees will customize and send the texts to their respective networks.\n\n\"Us at the New Georgia Project Action Fund, we can only share so much information,\" Jadavji said. \"But if we have a team of 50 Black men that are then sharing within their networks, that's far more believable, trustworthy, and then invites a lot more dialogue over the next few months.\"\n\nAccording to NBC News exit polling data, Trump won 11% of Georgia's Black voters in 2020, slightly up from the 9% he picked up in 2016.\n\nI am a politics reporter covering breaking news for NBC News, based in Washington, D.C. I cover the latest actions by the Trump administration, Congress and both political parties. As a 2024 campaign embed, I covered President Joe Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, Sen.

Activate your online access\n\nThe silence of Black MAGA supporters in the face of Trump's and Vance's bigotry during the campaign has carried over to the second Trump era.\n\nRepresentative Byron Donalds stands in the crowd as Donald Trump speaks in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, October 19, 2024.\n\nThis article originally appeared at TomDispatch.com . To stay on top of important articles like these, sign up to receive the latest updates from TomDispatch.com .\n\nDuring the 2024 election campaign, candidate Donald Trump's most controversial rally occurred at New York's Madison Square Garden. A comedian on the program referred to the island of Puerto Rico-and by implication Puerto Ricans-as garbage. He and the Trump campaign were rightfully pilloried and called out for his disgusting bigotry.\n\nLittle notice was given, however, to another noxious racist moment at the same event. On Trump's playlist for the rally was the Confederate and white-nationalist anthem \" Dixie .\" Notably, that song was played as Trump loyalist and harsh defender Representative Byron Donalds (R-FL) was coming on stage . Donalds is African American and perhaps Trump's most visible Black sycophant. While Black social media and journalists crucified Trump and Donalds over the incident, for Black MAGA supporters, the episode was simply put in the memory hole.\n\nThey were muted as well when Trump and vice-presidential candidate J.D. Vance spread racist falsehoods about Haitians supposedly eating cats and dogs in Springfield, Ohio. They seemed to be the only people in the country who didn't hear what everyone else had heard-a fabrication of stunning proportions.\n\nThe silence of Black MAGA supporters in the face of Trump's and Vance's bigotry during the campaign has carried over to the second Trump era. Now that he's president again, their voices are being quelled as his white-power, autocratic government takes shape.\n\nThe president has spent almost every day of his second term in office so far raging against diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI), issuing executive orders of a white-nationalist flavor, attacking a federal workforce that's disproportionately people of color, and making it clear that rolling back civil rights and Black social and education advances is one of his top priorities. Nearly every move of his has involved nods to racist themes and aims. That includes his effort to defy the Constitution and try to eliminate birthright citizenship , his mass firings and funding freezes while he vanishes DEI programs across the federal government, his plan to deport millions of undocumented immigrants (of color), and even his take on the wildfires in Los Angeles and the Washington area airplane-helicopter disaster .\n\nTrump thinks of his racialized and racist perspective on such events as \" common sense .\" Consider that a shield for his bias against and antipathy to science and evidence, as well as his visceral inability to see Black people and other people of color in any position of authority and expertise outside of sports and entertainment.\n\nHis vitriol against the world's most marginalized and poor has led him to try to completely shut the door on illegal (and even legal) immigration-with a single exception. Recently, he spread his arms and opened America's visa gates to Afrikaners , the whites whom he (along with Elon Musk) has determined are an oppressed minority in South Africa. Falsely claiming that their lands have been seized by the South African government and that they face genocide, in an executive order he called them \" victims of unjust racial discrimination .\" He also wrote on social media , \"Any Farmer (with family!) from South Africa, seeking to flee that country for reasons of safety, will be invited into the United States of America with a rapid pathway to Citizenship.\" Perhaps it's a coincidence that Elon Musk, Trump's copresident, who traffics in racist themes about race and intelligence online, is South African Apartheid-era born.\n\nIt must be strongly emphasized that Trump's executive order and his multiple social posts on the subject are not only blatant lies but align with the work of South African and American white supremacists who have falsely charged that a \" genocide \" is indeed occurring there. And speaking of white supremacists, add to that list his decision to release the white supremacists and neo-Nazis who were among the mob that stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021 (with, of course, Trump's blessing and encouragement). With the stroke of a pen, he absolved violent and white-nationalist criminals who had carried signs supporting the Holocaust and yelled racist epithets at Black Capitol police officers.\n\nHis war against Black agency has been happily joined by his MAGA allies in Congress. Representative Andrew Clyde (R-GA), for example, threatened to cut off millions of dollars in aid to the District of Columbia unless Mayor Muriel Bowser removed street art that read \"Black Lives Matter\" and renamed the area adjacent to it (previously known as Black Lives Matter Plaza) Liberty Plaza. Clyde claimed that the art was a \" divisive slogan .\" It went unmentioned that, if he genuinely wanted to get rid of divisive racial symbols, he could start at home. According to the Equal Justice Institute, Clyde's state of Georgia is host to \" more than 160 monuments honoring the Confederacy .\"\n\nAll of this is part of Trump's lawless and corrupt war on democracy and the strategic divisiveness that is both his brand and his currency. The convicted-felon-in-chief's usurpation of power has been as shameless as it is brazen, as he attempts to impose a government that could be characterized as racially authoritarian. In fact, racism should really be considered the central characteristic of Trump 2.0.\n\nAnd what has been the response of Black Republican members of Congress to such behavior? Where is the pushback from his (once upon a time) only Black cabinet member, former HUD Secretary Ben Carson? Has there been any reaction from Snoop Dogg, Nelly, or other pro-Trump rappers who claim affinity with the Black grassroots? The answer, of course, is not a peep. Most have run for cover, pretending that Trump is not who he has always been: a serial racist attempting to reshape the nation into a far-right, antidemocratic, white, Christian-nationalist stronghold.\n\nSome of his prominent Black acolytes have, in fact, gone on the record opposing \"equity\" and DEI in general. Byron Donalds, for example, says he has issues with \"equity\" because it puts a person's demographic ahead of his \"actual qualifications.\" It should be noted that, during the 2024 campaign, Donalds, whom Trump was then supposedly considering as a vice-presidential candidate, stated that the Jim Crow segregation era hadn't actually been so bad because \"the Black family was together\" and \"Black people voted conservatively.\"\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nBooks & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins\n\nBut qualifications or even competency are not really the issue. As New York Times columnist Jamelle Bouie wrote , \"Donald Trump does not care about merit.\" It couldn't be plainer or simpler than that. In late February, with the encouragement and full support of Department of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Trump fired Gen. C.Q. Brown Jr. from his position as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. There is little doubt that Trump got rid of him because he was Black and had been outspoken on issues of race and inclusion. Hegseth accused him of having a \" woke agenda .\" Brown, a four-star general, is to be replaced by Dan Caine, who, you undoubtedly won't be shocked to learn, is white and a three-star general.\n\nOn the rare occasions when Black MAGA denizens have actually addressed the president's pathological drive to resegregate the country , it has been to protect him and his policies from criticism. The Black Conservative Federation (BCF), for example, issued a statement, riven with White House talking points, defending Trump's (probably illegal) federal funding freeze , even as it was being condemned broadly by so many, including some of his Republican allies. Echoing Trump, it stated without evidence that the freeze would do no harm to programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Medicare, and Social Security while ignoring the massive negative impact it was going to have on Head Start, Medicaid, and other programs. To the BCF's embarrassment, the president was forced to rescind the order 48 hours after it was issued.\n\nTheir one-sided loyalty to Trump knows no bounds. Last year, BCF created and presented him with the \"Champion of Black America\" award at their gala. And that was no joke. He gleefully accepted the award while making awkward racial remarks to the mostly white crowd. The BCF also held an inauguration event for him with tickets ranging in price from $5,000 to $100,000 dollars, which, according to the group, was soon sold out.\n\nThe BCF declared on its Facebook page that it is proud to celebrate Black History Month (BHM) and encourages everyone to \"celebrate the rich tapestry of contributions made by African Americans throughout history.\" Yet there was not one word addressing the cancellation of BHM events at numerous departments across the federal government following the orders of the nation's white-supremacist-in-chief to quash DEI and any programs that seemed related to it. The Defense Department issued a memo declaring \"identity months dead,\" while the Transportation Department gleefully announced that it \"will no longer participate in celebrations based on immutable traits or any other identity-based observances.\"\n\nFar-right political scientist and Trump booster Carol Swain, best known for the Islamophobic rant that forced her to leave her tenured position at Vanderbilt University, wrote a mumble-jumble article hailing his attack on DEI. Although like some other Black conservatives she benefited from affirmative action, she now wants to pretend that DEI is an evil distortion of civil rights. She advocates for the neutral language of \"nondiscrimination,\" \"equal opportunity,\" and \"integration,\" suggesting that they are acceptable conservative values unlike \"diversity,\" \"equity,\" and \"inclusion.\" She seems pathetically unaware that Trump has no love for civil rights, voting rights, or affirmative action.\n\nIt must be noted that Black MAGA is overwhelmingly out of sync with the Black community in general. In large numbers, African Americans support DEI, affirmative action, and other hard-won programs that provide opportunities historically denied thanks to racial prejudice and discrimination. Black opposition to Trump is not just due to the racist slander and bile he now aims at people of color, but also to a well-documented history of bigotry. His long record of housing discrimination and advocacy for voting suppression flies in the face of the Fair Housing Act and the Voting Rights Act of the 1960s, signature victories for the civil rights and Black power movements that Trump and his Black supporters now disparage.\n\nTrump garnered only single-digit support from Blacks in his 2016 and 2020 presidential campaigns. Despite an effort to scam Black voters with Trump-created Black groups and false claims of surging Black support, he won only 6 percent of the Black vote in 2016 and 8 percent in 2020.\n\nIn the 2024 election, Trump won between 13 percent and 16 percent of the Black vote. This was a rise from, but not a great leap above, that 8 percent (documented by the Pew Research Center) in his 2020 loss to Joe Biden.\n\nMore recent data shows Trump rapidly losing whatever Black support he had. A YouGov and the Economist poll in February found that only 24 percent of Black Americans approved of Trump's job performance so far, while about 69 percent disapproved. In that poll, white approval was 57 percent and Hispanic approval 40 percent.\n\nIn the new Trump administration, Black Republicans have essentially no perch from which to speak out (even if they wanted to). Trump has one African American in his cabinet , HUD Secretary Scott Turner, as was true with Ben Carson in his first term. Both were ghettoized at HUD. And Turner has recently bent the knee and essentially surrendered HUD to Elon Musk's rampaging \"Department\" of Government Efficiency. Turner, in fact, even formed a DOGE Task Force that will certainly lead to staff cuts at HUD (but no guarantee whatsoever of any savings). In the meantime, HUD canceled $4 million in DEI contracts.\n\nTrump also nominated former football star and disastrous Senate candidate Herschel Walker to be ambassador to the Bahamas. Walker, who had to be chaperoned to interviews during his 2020 Senate campaign by Senator Lindsey Graham and others due to his striking inability to make it through an interview without numerous gaffes, has no qualifications whatsoever to be an ambassador.\n\nWhile some of Trump's Black supporters have grumbled privately about being ostracized and marginalized, they dare not speak out publicly or demonstrate anything less than 100 percent fealty. And they are hardly the only Blacks suffering job losses because of Trump.\n\nHis goal to get rid of tens of thousands of federal workers will have an immediate impact on the economic and social health of the Black community. After all, African Americans constitute a disproportionate number of federal workers, a key area of employment that helped build the Black middle class. While African Americans constitute about 12.5 percent of the population, they are about 19 percent of the federal workforce. And being central to DEI, they are essentially guaranteed to be first on the chopping black.\n\nYet Black MAGA gathered for a Trump-led Black History Month celebration at the White House, clearly unphased by the irony of such a grim Saturday Night Live -style moment. Like his previous BHM events, it was, of course, mostly about Trump. Some of his favorite old and new Black sycophants were there, including far-right Christian activist and niece of Martin Luther King Jr. Alveda King, golfer Tiger Woods (rumored to be dating Trump's ex-daughter-in-law ), HUD Secretary Scott Turner, Senator Tim Scott, and Trump youth organizer C.J. Pearson.\n\nIn an interview, Pearson stated that \"President Trump's anti-DEI policies aren't promoting racism but what they are doing is manifesting the dream of the great Martin Luther King, Jr.: a nation where one isn't judged by the color of their skin but instead by the content of their character.\" Pearson was making this claim while, across the federal government, departments and agencies were canceling Black History Month celebrations and \"identity\" events.\n\nAs the crowd drank wine and ate snacks, neither Trump nor any of the attendees mentioned the elephant in the room: the president's savage anti-DEI campaign.\n\nUnless there is organized and mobilized political resistance, President Trump will continue to throw racist tantrums and engage in dangerous, even potentially disastrous, racist policies for the next three years and 10 months while Republicans, including Black MAGA types, stand by in a distinctly cowardly fashion. And count on one thing, as is likely to be true of so many other aspects of Donald Trump's policies: their capitulation will not age well.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

The GOP has fielded multiple Black nominees for statewide office and encouraged South Carolina Senator Tim Scott to run for president. Although these are mainly cynical attempts to peel away some Black support from Democrats, these developments do pose a threat to the party-but not for the reason many pundits think. For a party whose political power is based on stoking white fear and resentment, the trend is certainly notable at first blush. In just the past three years, Republicans have nominated Black candidates for vitally important contests: US Senate in Michigan (John James in 2020) and Georgia (Herschel Walker in 2022), and the party's standard-bearer in this year's Kentucky gubernatorial contest (Daniel Cameron). In 2021, Winsome Sears won her race for Virginia lieutenant governor. And now, on top of all that, Tim Scott has thrown his hat into the ring for the 2024 presidential race. Scott's candidacy has captured the attention of many reporters in the mainstream media. For example, The New York Times recently published a roundtable on the implications of his bid. But most of these analyses incorrectly diagnose what is happening, why it's happening, and what the true threat is to Democrats. New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg is a good example of this misunderstanding, writing in an op-ed last month that \"at a time when the Democratic Party is losing Black men, a Tim Scott nomination would be a nightmare for Joe Biden.\" It is important to set the record straight that Democrats are not, in fact, losing support from Black men even when the GOP is running Black candidates. A cursory glance at the results from their recent races affirms this fact: In both the Georgia and Michigan Senate races, the Democratic nominee secured 90 percent of the vote, even when, in Michigan , the Republican opponent was a Black man. All available electoral data continues to affirm that Black men are the second-most-Democratic demographic group in the country, second only to Black women. The confusion over the Black vote seems to be coming from the fact that the margin by which Democrats have won Black men shrank in the Trump era. While Trump lost by 69 percent among Black males in 2016, that margin fell to 60 percent in 2020. That shift, however, does not mean what reporters like Goldberg think it means. Black voters are not switching to the Republican Party. Republicans are just doing a better job of increasing voter turnout among infrequent voters. Reporters often apply this same faulty reasoning to Latino voters, which I wrote about last year . As I pointed out there, Trump's \"gains happened among voters usually on the sidelines of politics.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Current Issue View our current issue And therein lies the real challenge and difficulty for Democrats. The greatest threat to Biden's reelection is not that Black voters will throng the polling places to embrace Scott; It's that those infrequent voters will not vote at all. F or decades, Democrats have failed to resolve a fundamental dilemma: Black people are their most reliable and strongest supporters, but fear of alienating white voters mutes their full-throated support for Black equality. This ambivalence is most profound when it comes to addressing one of the most important issues of all-the racial wealth gap. The average white family in America has six times more wealth than the average Black family. This is, of course, the result of centuries of government-sanctioned and -enforced public policies, from slavery to sharecropping to redlining to racial restrictions in the GI Bill and New Deal. Despite this reality-even after the murder of George Floyd and many other innocent Black people-Democrats, who controlled both houses of Congress at the time, could not summon the courage or resolve to pass a bill that would simply study the issue of reparations. Biden doesn't need any congressional support to establish a Presidential Commission to examine reparations, but he has failed to take this basic step. With a new race looming, the challenge for Democrats will be inspiring and mobilizing Black voters. The default posture of the party will be to tiptoe through the policy landscape and unleash a fire hose of spending targeting white people to try to convince them that Democrats still care about them. From 2016 to 2020 , Democrats have devoted the lion's share of their election spending on communicating with white voters, at the expense of working to inspire Black ones. The GOP's flirtation with Black candidates is something that Democrats should absolutely take seriously, and they should be alert that Republicans, while cynical and shameless, are nonetheless tinkering with their electoral formula. The most effective response would be to intensify the fight for true racial equality and signal unequivocal support for the Black struggle for justice. In doing so, Democrats would reinforce the cornerstone of their winning coalition, at which time Republicans would return to their regularly scheduled programming of running white candidates who come from the tradition of voicing white resentment.\n\nFor a party whose political power is based on stoking white fear and resentment, the trend is certainly notable at first blush.

Scott's candidacy has captured the attention of many reporters in the mainstream media. For example, The New York Times recently published a roundtable on the implications of his bid. But most of these analyses incorrectly diagnose what is happening, why it's happening, and what the true threat is to Democrats. New York Times columnist Michelle Goldberg is a good example of this misunderstanding, writing in an op-ed last month that \"at a time when the Democratic Party is losing Black men, a Tim Scott nomination would be a nightmare for Joe Biden.\" It is important to set the record straight that Democrats are not, in fact, losing support from Black men even when the GOP is running Black candidates. A cursory glance at the results from their recent races affirms this fact: In both the Georgia and Michigan Senate races, the Democratic nominee secured 90 percent of the vote, even when, in Michigan , the Republican opponent was a Black man. All available electoral data continues to affirm that Black men are the second-most-Democratic demographic group in the country, second only to Black women. The confusion over the Black vote seems to be coming from the fact that the margin by which Democrats have won Black men shrank in the Trump era. While Trump lost by 69 percent among Black males in 2016, that margin fell to 60 percent in 2020. That shift, however, does not mean what reporters like Goldberg think it means. Black voters are not switching to the Republican Party. Republicans are just doing a better job of increasing voter turnout among infrequent voters. Reporters often apply this same faulty reasoning to Latino voters, which I wrote about last year .

The greatest threat to Biden's reelection is not that Black voters will throng the polling places to embrace Scott; It's that those infrequent voters will not vote at all. F or decades, Democrats have failed to resolve a fundamental dilemma: Black people are their most reliable and strongest supporters, but fear of alienating white voters mutes their full-throated support for Black equality. This ambivalence is most profound when it comes to addressing one of the most important issues of all-the racial wealth gap. The average white family in America has six times more wealth than the average Black family. This is, of course, the result of centuries of government-sanctioned and -enforced public policies, from slavery to sharecropping to redlining to racial restrictions in the GI Bill and New Deal. Despite this reality-even after the murder of George Floyd and many other innocent Black people-Democrats, who controlled both houses of Congress at the time, could not summon the courage or resolve to pass a bill that would simply study the issue of reparations. Biden doesn't need any congressional support to establish a Presidential Commission to examine reparations, but he has failed to take this basic step. With a new race looming, the challenge for Democrats will be inspiring and mobilizing Black voters. The default posture of the party will be to tiptoe through the policy landscape and unleash a fire hose of spending targeting white people to try to convince them that Democrats still care about them. From 2016 to 2020 , Democrats have devoted the lion's share of their election spending on communicating with white voters, at the expense of working to inspire Black ones. The GOP's flirtation with Black candidates is something that Democrats should absolutely take seriously, and they should be alert that Republicans, while cynical and shameless, are nonetheless tinkering with their electoral formula. The most effective response would be to intensify the fight for true racial equality and signal unequivocal support for the Black struggle for justice. In doing so, Democrats would reinforce the cornerstone of their winning coalition, at which time Republicans would return to their regularly scheduled programming of running white candidates who come from the tradition of voicing white resentment.\n\nScott's candidacy has captured the attention of many reporters in the mainstream media.

Yet the partisan battle for Black support has intensified during the Trump era. Polls and surveys showed that Donald Trump made small inroads with Black male voters in 2016, and chipped away further at the Democrats' historic advantage with that demographic in 2020. And now, in a narrow, hard-fought contest between Trump and African American nominee Kamala Harris, Democratic leaders and strategists have brought a fresh edge to the quest for Black male votes. Harris herself has downplayed the notion that any Black vote is the rightful sole possession of Democrats, instead stressing that it must be \"earned\"-but that's not the dominant strain of rhetoric coming from other party leaders. More and more, anxious Democrats are prone to speak and act as if Black men who do not support the Democratic Party are guilty of an act of racial betrayal. Take, as just one prominent recent example, the scolding that Barack Obama delivered to his Back male audience as he stumped for Harris in East Liberty, Penn. Speaking to a group of committed Harris supporters who were volunteering for her campaign, Obama oddly went out of his way to castigate Black men for hesitating to support a female presidential candidate. \"My understanding, based on reports I'm getting from campaigns and communities, is that we have not yet seen the same kinds of energy and turnout in all quarters of our neighborhoods and communities as we saw when I was running,\" Obama said. He went on to note that the problem \"seems to be more pronounced with the brothers.\" In an effort to reverse the decline of Black men's support for the Democratic Party, Harris recently released an \"Opportunity Agenda for Black Men.\" The plan would provide 1 million forgivable loans of up to $20,000 to Black entrepreneurs to start a business. Harris's program also includes education, training, and mentorship initiatives to help Black men secure \"good-paying\" jobs in high-demand sectors, including pathways to becoming teachers. Harris also advocates the legalization of recreational marijuana, thereby opening up new opportunities for Black Americans to succeed in the cannabis industry while eliminating at least one source of racialized over-policing. She also proposes to safeguard cryptocurrency investments for the roughly one-fifth of Black Americans who own crypto assets. As the grab-bag character of these proposals suggests, Harris's plan is less a full-blown agenda than an attempt to answer a question that our current politics cannot address directly: What should the federal government do for Black men? Any answer fails because there is no policy Harris can advance that only benefits Black people. (Indeed, it's far from clear how any of her proposals are specifically targeted to Black men, unless one perpetrates the stereotype that they are disproportionately heavy weed smokers.)

Again, look at the marijuana plank. Legalizing marijuana would undoubtedly help reduce arrests among Black offenders; however, the real problem here is the way Black Americans are policed at large-the legality of a given controlled substance plays a lamentably small role in the practice of police brutality or over-policing, as a former prosecutor like Harris well knows. Current Issue View our current issue Or take the education proposal. It's also a worthy goal to increase the number of Black men in education. Research shows that when Black students have a Black teacher, they earn higher test scores and are more likely to graduate from college. But here again, the deeper issue is structural: Black teachers have higher turnover rates than white teachers. (I know because I used to be one.) After Black teachers enter the profession, they often leave because of low pay, or because school administrators fail to support them, or value their contributions in the classroom. Harris's defense of crypto investments, meanwhile, is less virtuous on the merits. I have written for The Nation about the ways that the push to herd Black men into the cryptocurrency market exploits the well-worn social myth of Black self-help as the surest path to collective self-determination. As I noted then, the formula here is simple: \"Lure African Americans into the dream of wealth building, then pillage the wealth of unsuspecting Black investors on a still greater.... Because Black Americans have been denied the ability to build wealth through more stable and conventional channels, they are more likely to be drawn to cryptocurrency and other sketchy financial instruments billed as more accessible and democratic paths to investment wealth.\" Laid alongside the proposals to treat over-policing and education deficits in the Black community with surface-level and symbolic overtures, the crypto plank in Harris's agenda is a revealing lapse into long-standing bootstraps nostrums favored by neoliberal Democratic leaders. These scold-first postures run the gamut from Bill Clinton's cynical dressing down of Sistah Souljah in the 1992 campaign to Obama's own pet racial initiative, My Brother's Keeper, which revived the 1960s-era moral panic over the Black family's abiding dysfunctions as an incoherent response to the vigilante slaying of Trayvon Martin. In the absence of any viable political path forward permitting Black men to call out the genuine material deprivations behind their plight, they instead find themselves conscripted into roles as stock culture-war villains-or, at best, as wayward entrepreneurs requiring assistance in husbanding their investments in a financial sector that just happens to be the fastest-growing source of campaign donations . And so despite the belated assistance that Harris's agenda seeks to muster in remedying the Democrats' Black male voter problem, it's still the scolding reflex that stands out in highest relief. Back in East Liberty, Obama expanded on his sermon to \"the brothers,\" admonishing Black men for casting around for ready rationalizations for withholding their support from Harris. \"And you're coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses, I've got a problem with that,\" Obama said. \"Because part of it makes me think-and I'm speaking to [Black] men directly-part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.\" \"The women in our lives have been getting our backs this entire time,\" Obama continued. \"When we get in trouble and the system isn't working for us, they're the ones out there marching and protesting. And now, you're thinking about sitting out or supporting somebody who has a history of denigrating you, because you think that's a sign of strength, because that's what being a man is? Putting women down? That's not acceptable.\" A man in front of Obama said, \"I'm not.\" Obama replied, \"Cousin Pooky might.\" Indeed, some Black men are sexist; however, that sexism is not more pernicious than the sexism that exists among white men, nor is Black male sexism a particular brand of sexism that only exists in the Black community-we live in a sexist country that pollutes all men and violates all women. The rote admonitions that Obama has offered are actually rooted in the oldest mythology of Black male behavior: Any transgression committed by Black men is worse. This formula is applied in all sorts of setting to demonize Black men: Crime in general is bad, but \"Black-on-Black-crime\" is a pathology created by absent Black fathers and self-hating Black male youth that have no reverence for their race. A white Trump supporter is terrible, but the only thing worse than a white Trump supporter is a Black one. It's undeniably the case, as Democratic leaders insist, that Donald Trump's defeat is an urgent mandate. A second Trump presidency would be a stain on the United States and would perhaps irreparably damage its credibility as a functioning democracy. But if Democrats and Kamala Harris are truly serious about engaging Black men's support, they should short-circuit the sermonizing. Instead, they should meet Black men with the same compassion the party affords to their white male counterparts who have already gone over to Trump. Here , by way of instructive contrast, is Obama in 2018 talking about white male Trump supporters: Democracy demands that we're able also to get inside the reality of people who are different than us so we can understand their point of view. Maybe we can change their minds, but maybe they'll change ours. And you can't do this if you just out of hand disregard what your opponents have to say from the start. And you can't do it if you insist that those who aren't like you-because they are white, or because they are male-that somehow there's no way they can understand what I'm feeling, that somehow they lack standing to speak on certain matters. This is, to put it mildly, a pronounced departure from Obama's \"no excuses\" rhetoric that he deploys when speaking to Black men who are not even engaged in the behavior he is condemning. So what would it take to bring the Democrats' appeal to Black men into line with this same kind of reasoning? Here's a start, at least: Black men should refrain from supporting Trump because Trump is a rapist, a white supremacist who supports forced birth, and thinks the results of the Civil War were \" questionable .\" Black men should not vote for Trump because he menaces non-white communities, fomented a coup attempt to overturn the results of an election, and proposes suspending the Constitution and turning the military loose on his political opponents. There's at least the promise of genuine civic opportunity for Black men in that agenda, since it treats them like equal political subjects, and not a problem for neoliberal social engineers to solve.\n\nAnd now, in a narrow, hard-fought contest between Trump and African American nominee Kamala Harris, Democratic leaders and strategists have brought a fresh edge to the quest for Black male votes. Harris herself has downplayed the notion that any Black vote is the rightful sole possession of Democrats, instead stressing that it must be \"earned\"-but that's not the dominant strain of rhetoric coming from other party leaders.

These scold-first postures run the gamut from Bill Clinton's cynical dressing down of Sistah Souljah in the 1992 campaign to Obama's own pet racial initiative, My Brother's Keeper, which revived the 1960s-era moral panic over the Black family's abiding dysfunctions as an incoherent response to the vigilante slaying of Trayvon Martin.

And so despite the belated assistance that Harris's agenda seeks to muster in remedying the Democrats' Black male voter problem, it's still the scolding reflex that stands out in highest relief. Back in East Liberty, Obama expanded on his sermon to \"the brothers,\" admonishing Black men for casting around for ready rationalizations for withholding their support from Harris. \"And you're coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses, I've got a problem with that,\" Obama said. \"Because part of it makes me think-and I'm speaking to [Black] men directly-part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.\" \"The women in our lives have been getting our backs this entire time,\" Obama continued. \"When we get in trouble and the system isn't working for us, they're the ones out there marching and protesting. And now, you're thinking about sitting out or supporting somebody who has a history of denigrating you, because you think that's a sign of strength, because that's what being a man is? Putting women down? That's not acceptable.\" A man in front of Obama said, \"I'm not.\" Obama replied, \"Cousin Pooky might.\" Indeed, some Black men are sexist; however, that sexism is not more pernicious than the sexism that exists among white men, nor is Black male sexism a particular brand of sexism that only exists in the Black community-we live in a sexist country that pollutes all men and violates all women. The rote admonitions that Obama has offered are actually rooted in the oldest mythology of Black male behavior: Any transgression committed by Black men is worse. This formula is applied in all sorts of setting to demonize Black men: Crime in general is bad, but \"Black-on-Black-crime\" is a pathology created by absent Black fathers and self-hating Black male youth that have no reverence for their race. A white Trump supporter is terrible, but the only thing worse than a white Trump supporter is a Black one. It's undeniably the case, as Democratic leaders insist, that Donald Trump's defeat is an urgent mandate. A second Trump presidency would be a stain on the United States and would perhaps irreparably damage its credibility as a functioning democracy. But if Democrats and Kamala Harris are truly serious about engaging Black men's support, they should short-circuit the sermonizing. Instead, they should meet Black men with the same compassion the party affords to their white male counterparts who have already gone over to Trump. Here , by way of instructive contrast, is Obama in 2018 talking about white male Trump supporters: Democracy demands that we're able also to get inside the reality of people who are different than us so we can understand their point of view. Maybe we can change their minds, but maybe they'll change ours. And you can't do this if you just out of hand disregard what your opponents have to say from the start. And you can't do it if you insist that those who aren't like you-because they are white, or because they are male-that somehow there's no way they can understand what I'm feeling, that somehow they lack standing to speak on certain matters. This is, to put it mildly, a pronounced departure from Obama's \"no excuses\" rhetoric that he deploys when speaking to Black men who are not even engaged in the behavior he is condemning. So what would it take to bring the Democrats' appeal to Black men into line with this same kind of reasoning? Here's a start, at least: Black men should refrain from supporting Trump because Trump is a rapist, a white supremacist who supports forced birth, and thinks the results of the Civil War were \" questionable .\" Black men should not vote for Trump because he menaces non-white communities, fomented a coup attempt to overturn the results of an election, and proposes suspending the Constitution and turning the military loose on his political opponents. There's at least the promise of genuine civic opportunity for Black men in that agenda, since it treats them like equal political subjects, and not a problem for neoliberal social engineers to solve.\n\nIn an effort to reverse the decline of Black men's support for the Democratic Party, Harris recently released an \"Opportunity Agenda for Black Men.\" The plan would provide 1 million forgivable loans of up to $20,000 to Black entrepreneurs to start a business. Harris's program also includes education, training, and mentorship initiatives to help Black men secure \"good-paying\" jobs in high-demand sectors, including pathways to becoming teachers. Harris also advocates the legalization of recreational marijuana, thereby opening up new opportunities for Black Americans to succeed in the cannabis industry while eliminating at least one source of racialized over-policing. She also proposes to safeguard cryptocurrency investments for the roughly one-fifth of Black Americans who own crypto assets. As the grab-bag character of these proposals suggests, Harris's plan is less a full-blown agenda than an attempt to answer a question that our current politics cannot address directly: What should the federal government do for Black men? Any answer fails because there is no policy Harris can advance that only benefits Black people. (Indeed, it's far from clear how any of her proposals are specifically targeted to Black men, unless one perpetrates the stereotype that they are disproportionately heavy weed smokers.)

Again, look at the marijuana plank. Legalizing marijuana would undoubtedly help reduce arrests among Black offenders; however, the real problem here is the way Black Americans are policed at large-the legality of a given controlled substance plays a lamentably small role in the practice of police brutality or over-policing, as a former prosecutor like Harris well knows.

As I noted then, the formula here is simple: \"Lure African Americans into the dream of wealth building, then pillage the wealth of unsuspecting Black investors on a still greater.... Because Black Americans have been denied the ability to build wealth through more stable and conventional channels, they are more likely to be drawn to cryptocurrency and other sketchy financial instruments billed as more accessible and democratic paths to investment wealth.\" Laid alongside the proposals to treat over-policing and education deficits in the Black community with surface-level and symbolic overtures, the crypto plank in Harris's agenda is a revealing lapse into long-standing bootstraps nostrums favored by neoliberal Democratic leaders. These scold-first postures run the gamut from Bill Clinton's cynical dressing down of Sistah Souljah in the 1992 campaign to Obama's own pet racial initiative, My Brother's Keeper, which revived the 1960s-era moral panic over the Black family's abiding dysfunctions as an incoherent response to the vigilante slaying of Trayvon Martin. In the absence of any viable political path forward permitting Black men to call out the genuine material deprivations behind their plight, they instead find themselves conscripted into roles as stock culture-war villains-or, at best, as wayward entrepreneurs requiring assistance in husbanding their investments in a financial sector that just happens to be the fastest-growing source of campaign donations . And so despite the belated assistance that Harris's agenda seeks to muster in remedying the Democrats' Black male voter problem, it's still the scolding reflex that stands out in highest relief. Back in East Liberty, Obama expanded on his sermon to \"the brothers,\" admonishing Black men for casting around for ready rationalizations for withholding their support from Harris. \"And you're coming up with all kinds of reasons and excuses, I've got a problem with that,\" Obama said. \"Because part of it makes me think-and I'm speaking to [Black] men directly-part of it makes me think that, well, you just aren't feeling the idea of having a woman as president, and you're coming up with other alternatives and other reasons for that.\" \"The women in our lives have been getting our backs this entire time,\" Obama continued. \"When we get in trouble and the system isn't working for us, they're the ones out there marching and protesting. And now, you're thinking about sitting out or supporting somebody who has a history of denigrating you, because you think that's a sign of strength, because that's what being a man is? Putting women down? That's not acceptable.\" A man in front of Obama said, \"I'm not.\" Obama replied, \"Cousin Pooky might.\" Indeed, some Black men are sexist; however, that sexism is not more pernicious than the sexism that exists among white men, nor is Black male sexism a particular brand of sexism that only exists in the Black community-we live in a sexist country that pollutes all men and violates all women. The rote admonitions that Obama has offered are actually rooted in the oldest mythology of Black male behavior: Any transgression committed by Black men is worse. This formula is applied in all sorts of setting to demonize Black men: Crime in general is bad, but \"Black-on-Black-crime\" is a pathology created by absent Black fathers and self-hating Black male youth that have no reverence for their race. A white Trump supporter is terrible, but the only thing worse than a white Trump supporter is a Black one. It's undeniably the case, as Democratic leaders insist, that Donald Trump's defeat is an urgent mandate. A second Trump presidency would be a stain on the United States and would perhaps irreparably damage its credibility as a functioning democracy. But if Democrats and Kamala Harris are truly serious about engaging Black men's support, they should short-circuit the sermonizing. Instead, they should meet Black men with the same compassion the party affords to their white male counterparts who have already gone over to Trump. Here , by way of instructive contrast, is Obama in 2018 talking about white male Trump supporters: Democracy demands that we're able also to get inside the reality of people who are different than us so we can understand their point of view. Maybe we can change their minds, but maybe they'll change ours. And you can't do this if you just out of hand disregard what your opponents have to say from the start. And you can't do it if you insist that those who aren't like you-because they are white, or because they are male-that somehow there's no way they can understand what I'm feeling, that somehow they lack standing to speak on certain matters. This is, to put it mildly, a pronounced departure from Obama's \"no excuses\" rhetoric that he deploys when speaking to Black men who are not even engaged in the behavior he is condemning. So what would it take to bring the Democrats' appeal to Black men into line with this same kind of reasoning? Here's a start, at least: Black men should refrain from supporting Trump because Trump is a rapist, a white supremacist who supports forced birth, and thinks the results of the Civil War were \" questionable .\" Black men should not vote for Trump because he menaces non-white communities, fomented a coup attempt to overturn the results of an election, and proposes suspending the Constitution and turning the military loose on his political opponents.

To stay on top of important articles like these, sign up to receive the latest updates from TomDispatch.com .\n\nConsider Donald Trump to be in a racial bind when it comes to election 2024. After all, he needs Black voters to at least defect from Joe Biden in swing states, if not actually vote for him. Yet, more than ever, he also needs his white nationalist base to believe that a second Trump term will be even more racist than the first and he's been openly claiming that he'll address the ghost of anti-white racism. Not surprisingly, his evolving strategy for the Black vote has been high on empty symbolism and viral moments, but distinctly low on specific promised policy benefits for the Black community.\n\nMilkshakes and far-right policies are all the presumptive Republican presidential candidate has recently offered Blacks. Take his orchestrated photo op at a Chick-fil-A in Atlanta a preview of things to come. The event was organized by Black MAGA supporter and Republican operative Michaelah Montgomery, who recruited some young African Americans, probably students from nearby historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), to cheer for Trump when he entered the place. He proceeded to buy milkshakes for everyone. Montgomery herself gave Trump a picture-perfect hug and, to the glee of MAGAworld, stated , \"I don't care what the media tells you, Mr. Trump. We support you.\"\n\nNaturally, while there he made false claims about what he had done for Black folks while president. It wasn't quite a speech, but he more or less mumbled that he had great support in the area because \"I have done more for the people of Atlanta than any other president by far. I have done more for the black community than any other president since Abraham Lincoln and maybe including Abraham Lincoln, but since Abraham Lincoln. And it looks like our polling is very good in the state of Georgia overall. We are very happy about it. We have had-you see the support. It's been really something.\"\n\nNote to Trump: You had such great support in Georgia in 2021 that the GOP lost two Senate seats in run-off elections there (while you were trying to overthrow the government). And that was primarily because of the turnout of Black voters who, the previous November, had voted for President Biden and returned to vote Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock into office.\n\nWithout actually engaging the students at Chick-fil-A, and speaking in his usual broken fashion, Trump boasted : \"That's really nice. We took care of the-black colleges, university. They are taken care of. Biden did nothing for them. I did everything.\"\n\nNote to Trump: The Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education ( FUTURE ) Act you signed ensured that permanent funding for HBCUs would remain at essentially the same level as during the Obama administration (about $85 million). The Biden administration, on the other hand, has invested over $7 billion in HBCUs. That includes \"$3.6 billion for HBCUs through the American Rescue Plan and other COVID relief,\" \"$1.6 billion in capital finance debt relief for 45 public and private HBCUs,\" and \"$1.7 billion in grant funding to expand academic capacity and provide support for low-income students.\"\n\nMichaelah Montgomery is steeped in contemporary MAGA politics. She has ties to the Blexit Foundation, a group started by far-right provocateur and conspiracy theorist Candace Owens to sway African Americans from the Democratic Party. Montgomery states on her LinkedIn page that she was Blexit's city director for the Atlanta metro region. She is also the founder of Conserve the Culture, a group apparently devoted to converting young African American students to conservative, that is, Trumpublican, politics.\n\nIn interviews with the right-wing media, she made it appear that Trump had encountered a group of everyday young Black people at that Chick-fil-A who spontaneously expressed their love for him. In fact, it was a handpicked group that did not represent most HBCU students or the Black community more generally.\n\nIf she really thought Trump had developed significant popularity among Black students, why didn't she schedule him to speak at an HBCU? Montgomery later said : \"The media will definitely have you thinking that if [Trump] were to show up to our neighborhood...that an angry mob of some sort would form or a riot would ensue.\" She can pretend otherwise, but if Donald (\" the Black people like me \") Trump actually ever showed up to spew his usual lies to any HBCU audience or Black community in the nation, there would indeed be massive protests.\n\nWhile he claims he's had great relations with HBCU presidents, he only visited one of those schools during his presidency and it turned into a scandalous Trumpian event. In 2019, he gave a talk at Benedict College in South Carolina to crow about his criminal justice reform policies. However, Benedict students were asked to stay in their dorms, where they were essentially imprisoned for an hour and served lunch while Trump bloviated. The faculty, too, were requested to stay away. According to USA Today , only seven students were allowed to attend the event and they were not allowed to ask questions.\n\nTrump's Black supporters continue to propagate the false notion that he's going to make a historic breakthrough in voter support in the coming election. Polls are one thing, election results another. While his campaigns in 2016 and 2020 were wish-casting that he would get 15 percent to 20 percent of the Black vote, he only won 6 percent and 8 percent respectively.\n\nAnd it should be noted that Trump desperately wants to dump Black votes not cast for him. The Big Lie that he won in 2020 was premised on his contention that voting in Black-dominated cities was corrupt and that millions of votes should have been discounted. Accepting that \"reality\" is the price of admission to Trumpworld, whether at the Trump-colonized Republican National Committee or for any prospective vice-presidential candidate.\n\nAnd worse yet, his African American sycophants continue to drink the Kool-Aid. South Carolina Republican Senator Tim Scott humiliated himself recently on NBC's Meet the Press when he clumsily refused six (yes, six!) times to state that he would accept a Trump defeat in the fall. Repeatedly asked, he demonstrated that his desire to stay in Trump's good graces and potentially become his running mate took priority over the most basic stance for maintaining a constitutional democracy.\n\nIn the service of Trump, Scott also launched a video series , \"America's Starting Five,\" a weekly discussion between him and the other four Black Republicans in Congress, Representatives Burgess Owens (Utah), John James (Mich.), Wesley Hunt (Tex.), and Byron Donalds (Fla.). The goal: to convince Black voters that the GOP and Trump are the only way to go if African Americans want to get ahead.\n\nThe first episode, however, didn't focus on policy differences between the Democrats and Trump, but on two ill-advised and well-criticized statements by Joe Biden. In 2019, he said that \"poor kids are just as bright and talented as white kids,\" implying it was a given that white kids were bright and talented. He immediately recognized his mistake and tried to clean it up with gibberish. (\"Wealthy kids, black kids, Asian kids, no, I really mean it, but think how we think about it.\") In 2020, as he was finishing an interview with the popular Black radio host Charlamagne tha God, Biden said , \"Well I tell you what, if you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black.\" At the time, criticism flowed from across the political spectrum in the Black community, chastising the president for seemingly attempting to police Black racial identity.\n\nScott and the others used those statements to draw a conclusion about Biden's bigotry and then extend that critique to the Democratic Party. This required, of course, burying decades of Trump's racist statements and behavior in a memory hole that went deep into the center of the earth. It was an act of epic historical revisionism. They functionally erased the fact that he gave succor to white supremacists marching in Charlottesville , Virginia, in 2017, attacked voting rights, expressed a desire to shoot Black Lives Matter protesters, demanded that there be less immigrants from \"shithole\" nations and more from Norway, defamed black prosecutors, judges, and district attorneys with racist verbal attacks, insulted Harriet Tubman, and so much more during his presidency.\n\nYet consider Trump's first term nothing but an appetizer, should he be reelected. According to his campaign website, the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025, and Project 47, he will unleash a program of racial authoritarianism unseen since the worst days of slavery and Jim Crow segregation. And he'll be emboldened and enabled by a constitution filled with ambiguities and undemocratic provisions, by an increasingly reactionary Supreme Court he helped appoint, and by millions of his supporters (many of whom have shown a propensity for using violence to meet their idea of his agenda).\n\nTrump's second-term racial program is already emerging. He stated while president and recently reiterated that \"we will terminate every diversity, equity, and inclusion program across the entire federal government\" and end Biden's \"Marxist executive order that seeks to impose racist and woke sexual ideology across the federal government.\"\n\nBelieve him.\n\nAnd it won't just stop at the federal level or in the public sector. As The Guardian recently reported , MAGA forces are planning to go after all efforts at inclusion (whether related to racial, gender, religious, or sexual-orientation), including in the corporate sector and the non-profit world. Trump's former adviser Stephen Miller's America First Legal group and other far-right actors have already filed suits against Fearless Fund, a venture capital business founded by Black women; Hello Alice, which provides grants to small Black business owners; and the George Floyd Memorial scholarship program at Minneapolis's North Central University, among other initiatives. America First Legal has been on a hyper mission to end diversity efforts, all of which it perceives as harmful to white Americans.\n\nIn a broader context, Trump has stated , \"But if you look right now, there's absolutely a bias against white and that's a problem.\" First and foremost, Trump sees himself as a victim of racism by Black public authorities and has been signaling that he's all in on a campaign of overt white nationalism. It couldn't be clearer where he'll focus the resources of the White House and federal government should he return to power.\n\nAnd one thing is guaranteed: He'll have support for his actions. As USA Today noted , citing a CBS November poll, \"Most white voters supporting Trump believe that racial minorities are favored over white people.\" About 58 percent of Trump voters (as opposed to 9 percent of Biden ones) believe \"racial minorities\" are favored over \"white people.\"\n\nAnd his plans (as well as those of his GOP allies) to get back into office include not only voter suppression tactics like closing polling sites, ending early voting, and questioning mail-in or drop-box ballots, but attempting to employ an army of Election Day militias who will look for \"irregularities\" and \"illegal\" behavior. Is there any doubt where those 100,000 election watchers will be sent (or what they will look like)? And by the way, there has been stone-dead silence from Trump's Black supporters on the plan to send hardcore MAGA troops to Black and Latino communities in swing states.\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nJeet Heer\n\nElie Mystal\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nTrump has said to his Black backers, \"I'm being indicted for you, the Black population.\" That's his way of attempting to link his own misconduct and corruption to his conviction that the Black community is overwhelmingly filled with criminals. Even worse, he has insultingly compared himself to South African leader Nelson Mandela, one of the most famous prisoners in the world for nearly three decades. Of course, he knows absolutely nothing about Mandela or what sent him to prison, only that he was famous for it. Mandela became a global hero to tens of millions who fought for years for his freedom.\n\nYou undoubtedly won't be surprised to learn that, according to former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, The Donald had a remarkably low opinion of Mandela. Cohen wrote in Disloyal: A Memoir that, after Mandela died in 2013, Trump told him, \"Mandela f-ed the whole country up. Now it's a s-hole. F- Mandela. He was no leader.\"\n\nOf course, Trump knew little and could have cared less about Africa, or South Africa in particular. There is almost no record of him discussing or tweeting about South Africa. The one time he did, based on a news report by far-right commentator Tucker Carlson, he tweeted a white supremacist talking point, falsely claiming that there were \"large-scale killings\" of white farmers in that country. From former Klan leader David Duke to hard racist websites like The Daily Stormer , white supremacists naturally celebrated Trump's tweet.\n\nIn 2016, every white nationalist and supremacist in this country supported Donald Trump. In 2020-21, in the wake of the Charlottesville riots, immigration cruelties, and the January 6 insurrection, they supported him again. And now, as the 2024 election looms, and Trump fights \"anti-white\" racism, he has once more earned their love and their votes.\n\nSinger and activist John Legend who, along with his wife, Chrissy Teigen, has battled Trump for years, summed up the former president best. He said : \"He's done very little for us and he is at his core, truly, truly a racist.\"\n\nWelcome to the 2024 election season and a world in which Black MAGA is still MAGA to the core.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

In fact, the history of the suppression of Black voters is a first-rate horror story that as yet shows no sign of ending. While Democrats and progressives justifiably celebrated the humbling defeat of some of the most notorious election-denying Republican candidates in the 2022 midterms, the GOP campaign to quell and marginalize Black voters has only continued with an all-too-striking vigor. In 2023, attacks on voting rights are melding with the increasingly authoritarian thrust of a Republican Party ever more aligned with far-right extremists and outright white supremacists . It shouldn't be forgotten that the insurrection of January 6, 2021, at the Capitol in Washington was also an assault on minority voters. In the post-election weeks of 2020, insurrection-loving and disgraced President Donald Trump and his allies sought to discard votes in swing-state cities like Atlanta, Detroit, Las Vegas, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, and Phoenix. Those were all places with large Black, Latino, or Native American populations. It was no accident then that the overwhelmingly white mob at the Capitol didn't hesitate to hurl racist language, including the \"N\" word , at Black police officers as that mob invaded the building. For years, Republican lawmakers at the state level had proposed-and where possible implemented-voter-suppression laws and policies whose impacts were sharply felt in communities of color nationwide. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, \"At least 19 states passed 34 laws restricting access to voting,\" laws invariably generated by Republican legislators. These included bills to limit early voting, restrict voting by mail, and even deny the provision of water to voters waiting for hours in long lines, something almost universally experienced in Black and poor communities.

A recent example was Republican Wisconsin Elections Commissioner Robert Spindell, one of three GOP appointees on the six-person commission that oversees that state's elections. He openly bragged that the \"well thought out multi-faceted plan\" of the Republicans had resulted in a dramatic drop in Black voters in the 2022 midterm elections, including in Milwaukee, the state's largest city, which is about 40 percent African American. He wrote: \"We can be especially proud of the City of Milwaukee (80.2% Dem Vote) casting 37,000 less votes than cast in the 2018 election with the major reduction happening in the overwhelming Black and Hispanic areas.\" How Far Might Voter Suppression Go? You undoubtedly won't be surprised to learn that, rather than developing policies attractive to voters of color, the GOP and conservatives generally have chosen the path of voter suppression, intimidation, and gaming the system. And if anything, those attempts are still on the rise. In 2023, less than a month into the new year, according to The Guardian , Republicans across the country have proposed dozens of voter-suppression and election-administration-interference bills in multiple states. Republican state legislators in Texas alone filed 14 bills on January 10, including ones that would raise penalties for \"illegal\" voting, whether committed knowingly or not. More ominously, one Texas proposal would fund the creation of an election police force exclusively dedicated to catching those who violate voting or election laws. That unit would be similar to the draconian election-police unit created in Governor Ron DeSantis's Florida as part of what is functionally becoming a regime dedicated to a version of right-wing terror. Symbolically enough, for instance, Black ex-felons were disproportionately targeted by DeSantis . Although the campaign was launched with great fanfare, only a few generally confused ex-felons were arrested and most of them had been given misinformation by state officials about their eligibility to vote and were convinced that they had the right to do so. Current Issue View our current issue But DeSantis never really wanted to stop the virtually nonexistent crime of voter impersonation or fraud. His goal, and that of the GOP nationally, has been to strike fear into the hearts of potential non-Republican voters to ensure election victories for his party. In states like Alabama, Mississippi, and 20 others where the GOP controls both chambers of the state legislature and the governor's mansion, intimidating voter-tracking police squads could be the next play in an ongoing effort to undemocratically control elections. Such policing efforts would without question disproportionately target communities of color. While the expected midterm \"red wave\" of Republican victories didn't occur nationally in 2022, the same can't be said for the South. As documented by the Institute for Southern Studies' Facing South , the GOP actually outperformed expectations , expanding its hold on multiple state legislatures in the region. Prior to the election, analysts had predicted that the Republicans might gain 40 seats across the South; in fact, they gained at least 55. Not only did they take control of at least 25 state legislative chambers-the lone exception, Virginia's state senate where Democrats retained a two-seat majority-but they also built or maintained supermajorities in legislative chambers in Florida, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, and West Virginia. This means that even if a Democratic governor is in office, Republican legislators can pass extremist bills into law despite a gubernatorial veto. None of this is spontaneous, nor is it random. Tens of millions of dollars or more from super-rich conservative donors and right-wing foundations have poured into voter-suppression and election-manipulation efforts. Heritage Action for America, a conservative legislative-writing group linked to the Heritage Foundation, spent upwards of $24 million in 2021 and 2022 in key swing states to help Republicans write bills that would restrict voting, targeting Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, and Texas. Consider it anything but a coincidence that the language in voter-suppression bills in those states and elsewhere sounded eerily familiar. A The Guardian reported, at least 11 voter-suppression bills in at least eight states were due, in part or whole, to advocacy and organizing by Heritage Action. A New York Times investigation found that in Georgia, \"Of the 68 bills pertaining to voting, at least 23 had similar language or were firmly rooted in the principles laid out in the Heritage group's letter\" that offered outlines and details for how to limit voting access. Contemporary voter suppression efforts, however, go significantly beyond just trying to prevent people from voting or making it harder for them to do so. Credit that, at least in part, to the determination of so many Blacks, Latinos, and Native Americans to vote despite restrictions imposed by the states. Consequently, Republican legislators now seek to control-that is, manipulate-election administration, too. Their tactics include the harassment of election workers , far-right activists seeking positions as election officials, and various other potentially far-reaching legal maneuvers. In fact, in recent voting, attacks on election workers, officials, and volunteers have become so prevalent that a new national organization, the Election Officials Legal Defense Network (EOLDN), was formed to protect them. EOLDN provides attorneys and other kinds of assistance to such officials when they find themselves under attack. Meanwhile, a flood of far-right activists has applied for positions or volunteered to work on elections. Neo-fascist Steven Bannon and other extremist influencers have typically called for such activists to take over local election boards with the express purpose of helping Republicans and conservatives win power. Finally, GOP leaders in multiple states have been pushing an \" independent state legislature \" doctrine that argues such bodies have the ultimate power to determine election outcomes. They contend that governors, state supreme courts, and even the US Supreme Court have no jurisdiction over non-federal elections. Their fanciful and erroneous reading of Article 1, Section 4 and Article 2, Section 1 of the Constitution suggests that state legislatures can not only overturn the will of voters in a given election but select electors of their choice in a presidential contest, no matter the will of the voters. In past decisions, Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and the late Antonin Scalia indicated that they were at least open to such a reading. A firm decision on this matter may occur in that court's current session in the case of Moore v. Harper . Court watchers are split on whether the court's conservative majority might indeed embrace that \"doctrine\" in full, in part, or at all in ruling on that case later this year. Missed Chances Much of this dynamic of voter suppression is the result of the failure of congressional Democrats to carry two voting rights bills across the finish line. Black activists are all too aware that the Democrats blew the opportunity to pass such legislation during the last two years when they controlled both chambers of Congress, even if by the slimmest of margins in the Senate. The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act (JLVRAA) and the For the People Act (FtPA) were each game-changing bills that would, in many ways, have blunted the massive efforts of Republicans at the state level to institute voter restrictions and other policies that result in the disproportionate disenfranchisement of African Americans, Latinos, young people, and working-class voters generally, all of whom tend to vote Democratic. The JLVRAA would have restored the power of the Voting Rights Act to prevent the very passage of voter suppression laws taken away by the Supreme Court in 2013 in the case of Shelby County v. Holder . The FtPA would have banned partisan gerrymandering, expanded voting rights, and even supported statehood for Washington, D.C. Those bills were aimed specifically at countering the hundreds of voter-suppression proposals in Republican-controlled state legislatures. In its final report, the January 6 committee actually blew a chance to highlight the attacks on Black voting rights. That report's full-scale focus on the role of Donald Trump, who certainly was the key instigator of the insurrectionary events at the Capitol and its chief potential beneficiary, ended up obscuring the role of racism and white nationalism in the stop-the-steal movement that accompanied it and was so crucial to Republican election deniers. It should be remembered, though, that Trump's central argument and the biggest lie of all was that Black, Latino, and Native American votes should be thrown out in Atlanta, Detroit, Philadelphia, and other urban areas in states like Arizona and Nevada where he was rejected by overwhelming numbers. Unfortunately, the January 6 report didn't sufficiently identify white supremacy as a driver of the \"stop the steal\" movement. Despite the prominence of certain Black faces among the Trump camp, including conservative organizer Ali Alexander, Trump campaign aid Katrina Pierson, and former Georgia legislator Vernon Jones, January 6, in fact, represented the culmination of months of attacks on Black campaign workers, especially in Atlanta and Detroit. President Trump explicitly fired up white nationalists by name-checking and endangering individual African American election workers as spoilers of his alleged victory. The movement in some democratic states to follow Trump's autocratic playbook is now also metastasizing globally. In Brazil, on January 8, thousands of followers of the defeated far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro attacked government buildings in Brasília . Newly elected President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has had to confront a surging wave of election deniers in the early days of his administration. And it's important to note that Lula's voters were disproportionately from the north and northeastern regions of Brazil, areas with deep concentrations of Black and indigenous communities. In the United Kingdom, in 2022, the Conservative Party pushed through legislation that requires photo identification to vote in future elections beginning in May 2023. As with Republican legislation in Texas, student IDs will not suffice, creating a new obstacle for a constituency that tends to vote for the Labour Party. In a country where many working-class people don't have drivers' licenses and the state does not easily provide acceptable IDs, voter suppression is operative. A democracy agenda that recognizes the racial elements of voter suppression and election denial is sorely needed. At the federal level, President Biden and Congressional Democrats should prioritize keeping the issue alive, while forcing Republicans to divulge their undemocratic hand, until the Democrats (hopefully) fully take back Congress in 2024. At the state level, Democrats who have momentum from their victories in 2022 need to consolidate and strengthen voting-access laws and policies. In Michigan, for example, where the GOP had for years used its control of the state legislature to pass outlandish, racist laws that generated significant harm for Black communities, the recent Democratic sweep should mean a new voting day. Former President Trump and the rest of his crew, as well as state versions of the same, are sadly enough in a significant, if grim, American tradition. Isn't it time to focus more energy on how to stop their urge to suppress the Black vote?\n\nWhile Democrats and progressives justifiably celebrated the humbling defeat of some of the most notorious election-denying Republican candidates in the 2022 midterms, the GOP campaign to quell and marginalize Black voters has only continued with an all-too-striking vigor.

Although the campaign was launched with great fanfare, only a few generally confused ex-felons were arrested and most of them had been given misinformation by state officials about their eligibility to vote and were convinced that they had the right to do so. Current Issue View our current issue But DeSantis never really wanted to stop the virtually nonexistent crime of voter impersonation or fraud. His goal, and that of the GOP nationally, has been to strike fear into the hearts of potential non-Republican voters to ensure election victories for his party. In states like Alabama, Mississippi, and 20 others where the GOP controls both chambers of the state legislature and the governor's mansion, intimidating voter-tracking police squads could be the next play in an ongoing effort to undemocratically control elections. Such policing efforts would without question disproportionately target communities of color. While the expected midterm \"red wave\" of Republican victories didn't occur nationally in 2022, the same can't be said for the South. As documented by the Institute for Southern Studies' Facing South , the GOP actually outperformed expectations , expanding its hold on multiple state legislatures in the region. Prior to the election, analysts had predicted that the Republicans might gain 40 seats across the South; in fact, they gained at least 55. Not only did they take control of at least 25 state legislative chambers-the lone exception, Virginia's state senate where Democrats retained a two-seat majority-but they also built or maintained supermajorities in legislative chambers in Florida, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, and West Virginia. This means that even if a Democratic governor is in office, Republican legislators can pass extremist bills into law despite a gubernatorial veto. None of this is spontaneous, nor is it random. Tens of millions of dollars or more from super-rich conservative donors and right-wing foundations have poured into voter-suppression and election-manipulation efforts. Heritage Action for America, a conservative legislative-writing group linked to the Heritage Foundation, spent upwards of $24 million in 2021 and 2022 in key swing states to help Republicans write bills that would restrict voting, targeting Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, and Texas. Consider it anything but a coincidence that the language in voter-suppression bills in those states and elsewhere sounded eerily familiar. A The Guardian reported, at least 11 voter-suppression bills in at least eight states were due, in part or whole, to advocacy and organizing by Heritage Action. A New York Times investigation found that in Georgia, \"Of the 68 bills pertaining to voting, at least 23 had similar language or were firmly rooted in the principles laid out in the Heritage group's letter\" that offered outlines and details for how to limit voting access. Contemporary voter suppression efforts, however, go significantly beyond just trying to prevent people from voting or making it harder for them to do so. Credit that, at least in part, to the determination of so many Blacks, Latinos, and Native Americans to vote despite restrictions imposed by the states. Consequently, Republican legislators now seek to control-that is, manipulate-election administration, too. Their tactics include the harassment of election workers , far-right activists seeking positions as election officials, and various other potentially far-reaching legal maneuvers. In fact, in recent voting, attacks on election workers, officials, and volunteers have become so prevalent that a new national organization, the Election Officials Legal Defense Network (EOLDN), was formed to protect them. EOLDN provides attorneys and other kinds of assistance to such officials when they find themselves under attack. Meanwhile, a flood of far-right activists has applied for positions or volunteered to work on elections. Neo-fascist Steven Bannon and other extremist influencers have typically called for such activists to take over local election boards with the express purpose of helping Republicans and conservatives win power. Finally, GOP leaders in multiple states have been pushing an \" independent state legislature \" doctrine that argues such bodies have the ultimate power to determine election outcomes. They contend that governors, state supreme courts, and even the US Supreme Court have no jurisdiction over non-federal elections. Their fanciful and erroneous reading of Article 1, Section 4 and Article 2, Section 1 of the Constitution suggests that state legislatures can not only overturn the will of voters in a given election but select electors of their choice in a presidential contest, no matter the will of the voters. In past decisions, Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and the late Antonin Scalia indicated that they were at least open to such a reading. A firm decision on this matter may occur in that court's current session in the case of Moore v. Harper . Court watchers are split on whether the court's conservative majority might indeed embrace that \"doctrine\" in full, in part, or at all in ruling on that case later this year. Missed Chances Much of this dynamic of voter suppression is the result of the failure of congressional Democrats to carry two voting rights bills across the finish line. Black activists are all too aware that the Democrats blew the opportunity to pass such legislation during the last two years when they controlled both chambers of Congress, even if by the slimmest of margins in the Senate. The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act (JLVRAA) and the For the People Act (FtPA) were each game-changing bills that would, in many ways, have blunted the massive efforts of Republicans at the state level to institute voter restrictions and other policies that result in the disproportionate disenfranchisement of African Americans, Latinos, young people, and working-class voters generally, all of whom tend to vote Democratic. The JLVRAA would have restored the power of the Voting Rights Act to prevent the very passage of voter suppression laws taken away by the Supreme Court in 2013 in the case of Shelby County v. Holder . The FtPA would have banned partisan gerrymandering, expanded voting rights, and even supported statehood for Washington, D.C. Those bills were aimed specifically at countering the hundreds of voter-suppression proposals in Republican-controlled state legislatures. In its final report, the January 6 committee actually blew a chance to highlight the attacks on Black voting rights. That report's full-scale focus on the role of Donald Trump, who certainly was the key instigator of the insurrectionary events at the Capitol and its chief potential beneficiary, ended up obscuring the role of racism and white nationalism in the stop-the-steal movement that accompanied it and was so crucial to Republican election deniers. It should be remembered, though, that Trump's central argument and the biggest lie of all was that Black, Latino, and Native American votes should be thrown out in Atlanta, Detroit, Philadelphia, and other urban areas in states like Arizona and Nevada where he was rejected by overwhelming numbers. Unfortunately, the January 6 report didn't sufficiently identify white supremacy as a driver of the \"stop the steal\" movement. Despite the prominence of certain Black faces among the Trump camp, including conservative organizer Ali Alexander, Trump campaign aid Katrina Pierson, and former Georgia legislator Vernon Jones, January 6, in fact, represented the culmination of months of attacks on Black campaign workers, especially in Atlanta and Detroit. President Trump explicitly fired up white nationalists by name-checking and endangering individual African American election workers as spoilers of his alleged victory. The movement in some democratic states to follow Trump's autocratic playbook is now also metastasizing globally. In Brazil, on January 8, thousands of followers of the defeated far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro attacked government buildings in Brasília . Newly elected President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has had to confront a surging wave of election deniers in the early days of his administration. And it's important to note that Lula's voters were disproportionately from the north and northeastern regions of Brazil, areas with deep concentrations of Black and indigenous communities. In the United Kingdom, in 2022, the Conservative Party pushed through legislation that requires photo identification to vote in future elections beginning in May 2023. As with Republican legislation in Texas, student IDs will not suffice, creating a new obstacle for a constituency that tends to vote for the Labour Party. In a country where many working-class people don't have drivers' licenses and the state does not easily provide acceptable IDs, voter suppression is operative. A democracy agenda that recognizes the racial elements of voter suppression and election denial is sorely needed. At the federal level, President Biden and Congressional Democrats should prioritize keeping the issue alive, while forcing Republicans to divulge their undemocratic hand, until the Democrats (hopefully) fully take back Congress in 2024. At the state level, Democrats who have momentum from their victories in 2022 need to consolidate and strengthen voting-access laws and policies. In Michigan, for example, where the GOP had for years used its control of the state legislature to pass outlandish, racist laws that generated significant harm for Black communities, the recent Democratic sweep should mean a new voting day. Former President Trump and the rest of his crew, as well as state versions of the same, are sadly enough in a significant, if grim, American tradition. Isn't it time to focus more energy on how to stop their urge to suppress the Black vote?\n\nIt shouldn't be forgotten that the insurrection of January 6, 2021, at the Capitol in Washington was also an assault on minority voters. In the post-election weeks of 2020, insurrection-loving and disgraced President Donald Trump and his allies sought to discard votes in swing-state cities like Atlanta, Detroit, Las Vegas, Milwaukee, Philadelphia, and Phoenix. Those were all places with large Black, Latino, or Native American populations. It was no accident then that the overwhelmingly white mob at the Capitol didn't hesitate to hurl racist language, including the \"N\" word , at Black police officers as that mob invaded the building. For years, Republican lawmakers at the state level had proposed-and where possible implemented-voter-suppression laws and policies whose impacts were sharply felt in communities of color nationwide. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, \"At least 19 states passed 34 laws restricting access to voting,\" laws invariably generated by Republican legislators. These included bills to limit early voting, restrict voting by mail, and even deny the provision of water to voters waiting for hours in long lines, something almost universally experienced in Black and poor communities.

He openly bragged that the \"well thought out multi-faceted plan\" of the Republicans had resulted in a dramatic drop in Black voters in the 2022 midterm elections, including in Milwaukee, the state's largest city, which is about 40 percent African American. He wrote: \"We can be especially proud of the City of Milwaukee (80.2% Dem Vote) casting 37,000 less votes than cast in the 2018 election with the major reduction happening in the overwhelming Black and Hispanic areas.\" How Far Might Voter Suppression Go? You undoubtedly won't be surprised to learn that, rather than developing policies attractive to voters of color, the GOP and conservatives generally have chosen the path of voter suppression, intimidation, and gaming the system. And if anything, those attempts are still on the rise. In 2023, less than a month into the new year, according to The Guardian , Republicans across the country have proposed dozens of voter-suppression and election-administration-interference bills in multiple states. Republican state legislators in Texas alone filed 14 bills on January 10, including ones that would raise penalties for \"illegal\" voting, whether committed knowingly or not. More ominously, one Texas proposal would fund the creation of an election police force exclusively dedicated to catching those who violate voting or election laws. That unit would be similar to the draconian election-police unit created in Governor Ron DeSantis's Florida as part of what is functionally becoming a regime dedicated to a version of right-wing terror. Symbolically enough, for instance, Black ex-felons were disproportionately targeted by DeSantis .

And if anything, those attempts are still on the rise. In 2023, less than a month into the new year, according to The Guardian , Republicans across the country have proposed dozens of voter-suppression and election-administration-interference bills in multiple states. Republican state legislators in Texas alone filed 14 bills on January 10, including ones that would raise penalties for \"illegal\" voting, whether committed knowingly or not. More ominously, one Texas proposal would fund the creation of an election police force exclusively dedicated to catching those who violate voting or election laws. That unit would be similar to the draconian election-police unit created in Governor Ron DeSantis's Florida as part of what is functionally becoming a regime dedicated to a version of right-wing terror. Symbolically enough, for instance, Black ex-felons were disproportionately targeted by DeSantis . Although the campaign was launched with great fanfare, only a few generally confused ex-felons were arrested and most of them had been given misinformation by state officials about their eligibility to vote and were convinced that they had the right to do so. Current Issue View our current issue But DeSantis never really wanted to stop the virtually nonexistent crime of voter impersonation or fraud. His goal, and that of the GOP nationally, has been to strike fear into the hearts of potential non-Republican voters to ensure election victories for his party. In states like Alabama, Mississippi, and 20 others where the GOP controls both chambers of the state legislature and the governor's mansion, intimidating voter-tracking police squads could be the next play in an ongoing effort to undemocratically control elections. Such policing efforts would without question disproportionately target communities of color. While the expected midterm \"red wave\" of Republican victories didn't occur nationally in 2022, the same can't be said for the South. As documented by the Institute for Southern Studies' Facing South , the GOP actually outperformed expectations , expanding its hold on multiple state legislatures in the region. Prior to the election, analysts had predicted that the Republicans might gain 40 seats across the South; in fact, they gained at least 55. Not only did they take control of at least 25 state legislative chambers-the lone exception, Virginia's state senate where Democrats retained a two-seat majority-but they also built or maintained supermajorities in legislative chambers in Florida, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, and West Virginia. This means that even if a Democratic governor is in office, Republican legislators can pass extremist bills into law despite a gubernatorial veto. None of this is spontaneous, nor is it random. Tens of millions of dollars or more from super-rich conservative donors and right-wing foundations have poured into voter-suppression and election-manipulation efforts. Heritage Action for America, a conservative legislative-writing group linked to the Heritage Foundation, spent upwards of $24 million in 2021 and 2022 in key swing states to help Republicans write bills that would restrict voting, targeting Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, and Texas. Consider it anything but a coincidence that the language in voter-suppression bills in those states and elsewhere sounded eerily familiar. A The Guardian reported, at least 11 voter-suppression bills in at least eight states were due, in part or whole, to advocacy and organizing by Heritage Action. A New York Times investigation found that in Georgia, \"Of the 68 bills pertaining to voting, at least 23 had similar language or were firmly rooted in the principles laid out in the Heritage group's letter\" that offered outlines and details for how to limit voting access. Contemporary voter suppression efforts, however, go significantly beyond just trying to prevent people from voting or making it harder for them to do so. Credit that, at least in part, to the determination of so many Blacks, Latinos, and Native Americans to vote despite restrictions imposed by the states. Consequently, Republican legislators now seek to control-that is, manipulate-election administration, too. Their tactics include the harassment of election workers , far-right activists seeking positions as election officials, and various other potentially far-reaching legal maneuvers. In fact, in recent voting, attacks on election workers, officials, and volunteers have become so prevalent that a new national organization, the Election Officials Legal Defense Network (EOLDN), was formed to protect them. EOLDN provides attorneys and other kinds of assistance to such officials when they find themselves under attack. Meanwhile, a flood of far-right activists has applied for positions or volunteered to work on elections. Neo-fascist Steven Bannon and other extremist influencers have typically called for such activists to take over local election boards with the express purpose of helping Republicans and conservatives win power. Finally, GOP leaders in multiple states have been pushing an \" independent state legislature \" doctrine that argues such bodies have the ultimate power to determine election outcomes. They contend that governors, state supreme courts, and even the US Supreme Court have no jurisdiction over non-federal elections. Their fanciful and erroneous reading of Article 1, Section 4 and Article 2, Section 1 of the Constitution suggests that state legislatures can not only overturn the will of voters in a given election but select electors of their choice in a presidential contest, no matter the will of the voters. In past decisions, Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and the late Antonin Scalia indicated that they were at least open to such a reading. A firm decision on this matter may occur in that court's current session in the case of Moore v. Harper . Court watchers are split on whether the court's conservative majority might indeed embrace that \"doctrine\" in full, in part, or at all in ruling on that case later this year. Missed Chances Much of this dynamic of voter suppression is the result of the failure of congressional Democrats to carry two voting rights bills across the finish line. Black activists are all too aware that the Democrats blew the opportunity to pass such legislation during the last two years when they controlled both chambers of Congress, even if by the slimmest of margins in the Senate. The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act (JLVRAA) and the For the People Act (FtPA) were each game-changing bills that would, in many ways, have blunted the massive efforts of Republicans at the state level to institute voter restrictions and other policies that result in the disproportionate disenfranchisement of African Americans, Latinos, young people, and working-class voters generally, all of whom tend to vote Democratic. The JLVRAA would have restored the power of the Voting Rights Act to prevent the very passage of voter suppression laws taken away by the Supreme Court in 2013 in the case of Shelby County v. Holder . The FtPA would have banned partisan gerrymandering, expanded voting rights, and even supported statehood for Washington, D.C. Those bills were aimed specifically at countering the hundreds of voter-suppression proposals in Republican-controlled state legislatures. In its final report, the January 6 committee actually blew a chance to highlight the attacks on Black voting rights. That report's full-scale focus on the role of Donald Trump, who certainly was the key instigator of the insurrectionary events at the Capitol and its chief potential beneficiary, ended up obscuring the role of racism and white nationalism in the stop-the-steal movement that accompanied it and was so crucial to Republican election deniers. It should be remembered, though, that Trump's central argument and the biggest lie of all was that Black, Latino, and Native American votes should be thrown out in Atlanta, Detroit, Philadelphia, and other urban areas in states like Arizona and Nevada where he was rejected by overwhelming numbers. Unfortunately, the January 6 report didn't sufficiently identify white supremacy as a driver of the \"stop the steal\" movement. Despite the prominence of certain Black faces among the Trump camp, including conservative organizer Ali Alexander, Trump campaign aid Katrina Pierson, and former Georgia legislator Vernon Jones, January 6, in fact, represented the culmination of months of attacks on Black campaign workers, especially in Atlanta and Detroit. President Trump explicitly fired up white nationalists by name-checking and endangering individual African American election workers as spoilers of his alleged victory. The movement in some democratic states to follow Trump's autocratic playbook is now also metastasizing globally. In Brazil, on January 8, thousands of followers of the defeated far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro attacked government buildings in Brasília . Newly elected President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has had to confront a surging wave of election deniers in the early days of his administration. And it's important to note that Lula's voters were disproportionately from the north and northeastern regions of Brazil, areas with deep concentrations of Black and indigenous communities. In the United Kingdom, in 2022, the Conservative Party pushed through legislation that requires photo identification to vote in future elections beginning in May 2023. As with Republican legislation in Texas, student IDs will not suffice, creating a new obstacle for a constituency that tends to vote for the Labour Party. In a country where many working-class people don't have drivers' licenses and the state does not easily provide acceptable IDs, voter suppression is operative. A democracy agenda that recognizes the racial elements of voter suppression and election denial is sorely needed. At the federal level, President Biden and Congressional Democrats should prioritize keeping the issue alive, while forcing Republicans to divulge their undemocratic hand, until the Democrats (hopefully) fully take back Congress in 2024. At the state level, Democrats who have momentum from their victories in 2022 need to consolidate and strengthen voting-access laws and policies. In Michigan, for example, where the GOP had for years used its control of the state legislature to pass outlandish, racist laws that generated significant harm for Black communities, the recent Democratic sweep should mean a new voting day. Former President Trump and the rest of his crew, as well as state versions of the same, are sadly enough in a significant, if grim, American tradition.

Unfortunately, the January 6 report didn't sufficiently identify white supremacy as a driver of the \"stop the steal\" movement. Despite the prominence of certain Black faces among the Trump camp, including conservative organizer Ali Alexander, Trump campaign aid Katrina Pierson, and former Georgia legislator Vernon Jones, January 6, in fact, represented the culmination of months of attacks on Black campaign workers, especially in Atlanta and Detroit. President Trump explicitly fired up white nationalists by name-checking and endangering individual African American election workers as spoilers of his alleged victory. The movement in some democratic states to follow Trump's autocratic playbook is now also metastasizing globally. In Brazil, on January 8, thousands of followers of the defeated far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro attacked government buildings in Brasília . Newly elected President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has had to confront a surging wave of election deniers in the early days of his administration. And it's important to note that Lula's voters were disproportionately from the north and northeastern regions of Brazil, areas with deep concentrations of Black and indigenous communities. In the United Kingdom, in 2022, the Conservative Party pushed through legislation that requires photo identification to vote in future elections beginning in May 2023. As with Republican legislation in Texas, student IDs will not suffice, creating a new obstacle for a constituency that tends to vote for the Labour Party. In a country where many working-class people don't have drivers' licenses and the state does not easily provide acceptable IDs, voter suppression is operative. A democracy agenda that recognizes the racial elements of voter suppression and election denial is sorely needed. At the federal level, President Biden and Congressional Democrats should prioritize keeping the issue alive, while forcing Republicans to divulge their undemocratic hand, until the Democrats (hopefully) fully take back Congress in 2024. At the state level, Democrats who have momentum from their victories in 2022 need to consolidate and strengthen voting-access laws and policies. In Michigan, for example, where the GOP had for years used its control of the state legislature to pass outlandish, racist laws that generated significant harm for Black communities, the recent Democratic sweep should mean a new voting day. Former President Trump and the rest of his crew, as well as state versions of the same, are sadly enough in a significant, if grim, American tradition. Isn't it time to focus more energy on how to stop their urge to suppress the Black vote?\n\nIn states like Alabama, Mississippi, and 20 others where the GOP controls both chambers of the state legislature and the governor's mansion, intimidating voter-tracking police squads could be the next play in an ongoing effort to undemocratically control elections. Such policing efforts would without question disproportionately target communities of color. While the expected midterm \"red wave\" of Republican victories didn't occur nationally in 2022, the same can't be said for the South. As documented by the Institute for Southern Studies' Facing South , the GOP actually outperformed expectations , expanding its hold on multiple state legislatures in the region. Prior to the election, analysts had predicted that the Republicans might gain 40 seats across the South; in fact, they gained at least 55. Not only did they take control of at least 25 state legislative chambers-the lone exception, Virginia's state senate where Democrats retained a two-seat majority-but they also built or maintained supermajorities in legislative chambers in Florida, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, and West Virginia. This means that even if a Democratic governor is in office, Republican legislators can pass extremist bills into law despite a gubernatorial veto. None of this is spontaneous, nor is it random. Tens of millions of dollars or more from super-rich conservative donors and right-wing foundations have poured into voter-suppression and election-manipulation efforts. Heritage Action for America, a conservative legislative-writing group linked to the Heritage Foundation, spent upwards of $24 million in 2021 and 2022 in key swing states to help Republicans write bills that would restrict voting, targeting Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, and Texas. Consider it anything but a coincidence that the language in voter-suppression bills in those states and elsewhere sounded eerily familiar. A The Guardian reported, at least 11 voter-suppression bills in at least eight states were due, in part or whole, to advocacy and organizing by Heritage Action. A New York Times investigation found that in Georgia, \"Of the 68 bills pertaining to voting, at least 23 had similar language or were firmly rooted in the principles laid out in the Heritage group's letter\" that offered outlines and details for how to limit voting access. Contemporary voter suppression efforts, however, go significantly beyond just trying to prevent people from voting or making it harder for them to do so. Credit that, at least in part, to the determination of so many Blacks, Latinos, and Native Americans to vote despite restrictions imposed by the states. Consequently, Republican legislators now seek to control-that is, manipulate-election administration, too. Their tactics include the harassment of election workers , far-right activists seeking positions as election officials, and various other potentially far-reaching legal maneuvers. In fact, in recent voting, attacks on election workers, officials, and volunteers have become so prevalent that a new national organization, the Election Officials Legal Defense Network (EOLDN), was formed to protect them. EOLDN provides attorneys and other kinds of assistance to such officials when they find themselves under attack. Meanwhile, a flood of far-right activists has applied for positions or volunteered to work on elections. Neo-fascist Steven Bannon and other extremist influencers have typically called for such activists to take over local election boards with the express purpose of helping Republicans and conservatives win power. Finally, GOP leaders in multiple states have been pushing an \" independent state legislature \" doctrine that argues such bodies have the ultimate power to determine election outcomes. They contend that governors, state supreme courts, and even the US Supreme Court have no jurisdiction over non-federal elections. Their fanciful and erroneous reading of Article 1, Section 4 and Article 2, Section 1 of the Constitution suggests that state legislatures can not only overturn the will of voters in a given election but select electors of their choice in a presidential contest, no matter the will of the voters. In past decisions, Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and the late Antonin Scalia indicated that they were at least open to such a reading. A firm decision on this matter may occur in that court's current session in the case of Moore v. Harper . Court watchers are split on whether the court's conservative majority might indeed embrace that \"doctrine\" in full, in part, or at all in ruling on that case later this year. Missed Chances Much of this dynamic of voter suppression is the result of the failure of congressional Democrats to carry two voting rights bills across the finish line. Black activists are all too aware that the Democrats blew the opportunity to pass such legislation during the last two years when they controlled both chambers of Congress, even if by the slimmest of margins in the Senate. The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act (JLVRAA) and the For the People Act (FtPA) were each game-changing bills that would, in many ways, have blunted the massive efforts of Republicans at the state level to institute voter restrictions and other policies that result in the disproportionate disenfranchisement of African Americans, Latinos, young people, and working-class voters generally, all of whom tend to vote Democratic. The JLVRAA would have restored the power of the Voting Rights Act to prevent the very passage of voter suppression laws taken away by the Supreme Court in 2013 in the case of Shelby County v. Holder . The FtPA would have banned partisan gerrymandering, expanded voting rights, and even supported statehood for Washington, D.C. Those bills were aimed specifically at countering the hundreds of voter-suppression proposals in Republican-controlled state legislatures. In its final report, the January 6 committee actually blew a chance to highlight the attacks on Black voting rights.

That report's full-scale focus on the role of Donald Trump, who certainly was the key instigator of the insurrectionary events at the Capitol and its chief potential beneficiary, ended up obscuring the role of racism and white nationalism in the stop-the-steal movement that accompanied it and was so crucial to Republican election deniers. It should be remembered, though, that Trump's central argument and the biggest lie of all was that Black, Latino, and Native American votes should be thrown out in Atlanta, Detroit, Philadelphia, and other urban areas in states like Arizona and Nevada where he was rejected by overwhelming numbers. Unfortunately, the January 6 report didn't sufficiently identify white supremacy as a driver of the \"stop the steal\" movement. Despite the prominence of certain Black faces among the Trump camp, including conservative organizer Ali Alexander, Trump campaign aid Katrina Pierson, and former Georgia legislator Vernon Jones, January 6, in fact, represented the culmination of months of attacks on Black campaign workers, especially in Atlanta and Detroit. President Trump explicitly fired up white nationalists by name-checking and endangering individual African American election workers as spoilers of his alleged victory. The movement in some democratic states to follow Trump's autocratic playbook is now also metastasizing globally. In Brazil, on January 8, thousands of followers of the defeated far-right former president Jair Bolsonaro attacked government buildings in Brasília . Newly elected President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva has had to confront a surging wave of election deniers in the early days of his administration. And it's important to note that Lula's voters were disproportionately from the north and northeastern regions of Brazil, areas with deep concentrations of Black and indigenous communities. In the United Kingdom, in 2022, the Conservative Party pushed through legislation that requires photo identification to vote in future elections beginning in May 2023. As with Republican legislation in Texas, student IDs will not suffice, creating a new obstacle for a constituency that tends to vote for the Labour Party. In a country where many working-class people don't have drivers' licenses and the state does not easily provide acceptable IDs, voter suppression is operative. A democracy agenda that recognizes the racial elements of voter suppression and election denial is sorely needed. At the federal level, President Biden and Congressional Democrats should prioritize keeping the issue alive, while forcing Republicans to divulge their undemocratic hand, until the Democrats (hopefully) fully take back Congress in 2024. At the state level, Democrats who have momentum from their victories in 2022 need to consolidate and strengthen voting-access laws and policies. In Michigan, for example, where the GOP had for years used its control of the state legislature to pass outlandish, racist laws that generated significant harm for Black communities, the recent Democratic sweep should mean a new voting day. Former President Trump and the rest of his crew, as well as state versions of the same, are sadly enough in a significant, if grim, American tradition. Isn't it time to focus more energy on how to stop their urge to suppress the Black vote?\n\nMeanwhile, a flood of far-right activists has applied for positions or volunteered to work on elections. Neo-fascist Steven Bannon and other extremist influencers have typically called for such activists to take over local election boards with the express purpose of helping Republicans and conservatives win power. Finally, GOP leaders in multiple states have been pushing an \" independent state legislature \" doctrine that argues such bodies have the ultimate power to determine election outcomes. They contend that governors, state supreme courts, and even the US Supreme Court have no jurisdiction over non-federal elections. Their fanciful and erroneous reading of Article 1, Section 4 and Article 2, Section 1 of the Constitution suggests that state legislatures can not only overturn the will of voters in a given election but select electors of their choice in a presidential contest, no matter the will of the voters. In past decisions, Supreme Court Justices Clarence Thomas and the late Antonin Scalia indicated that they were at least open to such a reading. A firm decision on this matter may occur in that court's current session in the case of Moore v. Harper . Court watchers are split on whether the court's conservative majority might indeed embrace that \"doctrine\" in full, in part, or at all in ruling on that case later this year. Missed Chances Much of this dynamic of voter suppression is the result of the failure of congressional Democrats to carry two voting rights bills across the finish line. Black activists are all too aware that the Democrats blew the opportunity to pass such legislation during the last two years when they controlled both chambers of Congress, even if by the slimmest of margins in the Senate. The John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act (JLVRAA) and the For the People Act (FtPA) were each game-changing bills that would, in many ways, have blunted the massive efforts of Republicans at the state level to institute voter restrictions and other policies that result in the disproportionate disenfranchisement of African Americans, Latinos, young people, and working-class voters generally, all of whom tend to vote Democratic. The JLVRAA would have restored the power of the Voting Rights Act to prevent the very passage of voter suppression laws taken away by the Supreme Court in 2013 in the case of Shelby County v. Holder . The FtPA would have banned partisan gerrymandering, expanded voting rights, and even supported statehood for Washington, D.C.

In fact, Kamala Harris's historic candidacy has galvanized voters across the political spectrum to such an extent that nearly every state Barack Obama won in 2012 is within reach and winnable by Harris. But, surprisingly, you won't see much mention of this critical development on the electoral landscape.\n\nMost of those in the media don't properly appreciate the underlying trends and dynamics of this election because of their stubborn insistence on ignoring what is the most determinative set of relevant data that exists-the differences in political preferences of our country's respective racial groups. Since the advent of modern-day exit polling in 1976, the starkest difference among subsets of the nation's population can be seen in the voting choices of Black and white voters. Over the past 44 years , no Democratic nominee for president has ever received less than 83 percent of the Black vote, according to exit polls, and the majority of white voters have always sided with the Republican nominee (Jimmy Carter is the Democrat who has come the closest to winning the white vote, securing 48 percent of it in 1976 ).\n\nTo address this gap in the political analytical landscape, I worked with data scientist Dr. Julie Martinez Ortega two years ago to develop the New Majority Index (NMI), the only election resource that incorporates historical election data, polling results, and racial demographic data from the US Census. When elections are viewed through this lens, a clearer picture emerges of what's happening, and what's possible. For example, I wrote in 2022 how the NMI indicated that there were far more competitive House seats in play than most pundits believed in a year when nearly everyone was prognosticating a \"red wave\" of Republican House pickups . As the NMI suggested, that red wave never materialized, resulting in a mere pink puddle of just a handful of seats changing parties instead of the dozens that most were forecasting.\n\nI've updated and expanded the NMI model this election cycle to incorporate electoral and demographic data from presidential elections, in addition to congressional contests. In particular, I have added pertinent data points from the 2012 election-the last time there was a Black presidential nominee. Viewed through this prism, the 2024 map of competitive states is far larger than most in the media realize.\n\nAs was the case with Obama's candidacy, Harris has electrified the electorate, causing a surge of enthusiasm and excitement across the country, especially galvanizing people of color, and women of color in particular, who have demonstrated their excitement about the prospect of sending someone of their background and life experience to the White House.\n\nThe tidal wave of support began the very day Joe Biden withdrew from the race. On Sunday, July 21, more than 44,000 Black women joined a Zoom call to strategize and coordinate their efforts, raising $1.6 million in a matter of hours. That combination of technological and demographic revolutions was repeated throughout the week as hundreds of thousands people joined similar Zoom calls organized by and for Black men, Latinos, Asian Americans, white women, and even \"White Dudes for Harris.\" By the end of the week, the entire electoral landscape had been transformed, and Harris's position at the top of the ticket was secured.\n\nThe enthusiasm continued to manifest as Harris shattered fundraising records, bringing in $ 200 million in the first week of her campaign , a fundraising haul unmatched in the history of US politics. Almost immediately, the polls began to tighten, as previously divided Democrats (those who wanted Biden to stay in, those who wanted Harris instead, and those who wanted someone else entirely) consolidated their support behind the Harris-Walz ticket. Notably, that excitement promptly brought back into play relatively more recent \"purple\" battleground states such as Georgia and Arizona. In the first week of her candidacy, Harris traveled to Georgia, attracting the largest crowd of the campaign cycle in the Peach State as more than 10,000 people packed the arena.\n\nWhile much of the mainstream media has recognized that the full 2020 set of states are currently competitive, what most still don't see is that Harris's candidacy has brought back into play not just the 2020 states but also the 2012 states. The levels of excitement and energy among voters of color now make nearly all of the states won by Obama newly winnable by Democrats.\n\nThis rapidly emerging reality is affirmed by the New Majority Index and the latest polling data. The \"Obama coalition\"-what I call in my books \"the New American Majority\"-consists of the overwhelming majority of people of color aligning with a meaningful minority of white voters. The Democrats' \"formula\" for victory involves combining the necessary proportions of support from the country's respective racial groups.\n\nTwo dominant realities combine to illuminate the potential of Florida and North Carolina-Harris's current polling numbers among white voters and the lag in support from Black voters showing up in the polling data (that is, most polls are failing to capture the depth and breadth of Black voters' support for Harris).\n\nIn Florida in 2012, Obama won the state with the support of just 37 percent of the state's white voters. In North Carolina in 2008 (the year Obama won the state, before narrowly losing it in 2012), his white support was only 35 percent, according to the exit polls. The most recent polling data show Harris doing better among white voters than Obama did in Florida and North Carolina (39 percent in Florida and 37 percent in North Carolina, according to the latest polls).\n\nIn both states, despite increasing demographic diversity, white voters remain the largest sector of the electorate (59 percent of the eligible voters in Florida and 65 percent in North Carolina), so Harris's surpassing Obama's levels is extremely significant.\n\nWhat makes the electoral map look particularly promising for Harris is the reality that polls are undercounting Harris's Black support. That is, there is a lag between what they currently show in terms of Black voter preferences and what her support is most likely to be.\n\nThis lag is most pronounced in the latest New York Times /Siena College poll which shows Harris's support among Black voters at just 75 percent. No Democratic nominee has ever received less than 83 percent of the Black vote, so it's nonsensical to accept a number like 75 percent as accurate of what Harris's ultimate 2024 numbers will be. The qualitative and quantitative tea leaves all suggest that Harris will win more than 90 percent of the Black vote. According to Pew Research's rigorous statistical analysis , the Biden/Harris 2020 ticket received 92 percent percent of the Black vote. In the prior historical analog, Obama received 93 percent of the Black vote nationally, winning 95 percent of Black voters' support in Florida and North Carolina.\n\nIf Harris's support among Black voters continues to consolidate as it has over the past two months, then she stands a very strong chance of winning both states. In Florida, the critical constituency will be Latinos, and she needs to secure 60 percent of that community's votes to prevail. The latest polls show just 50 percent of Latinos backing Harris, but that number is likely low and lagging, as the September Pew survey shows that, nationally, 57 percent of Latinos back Harris.\n\nIn North Carolina, YouGov's August poll shows Harris meeting the Obama threshold of white support, but the number for Black voters is clearly incorrect at 75 percent. If the 37 percent of white voters' support holds, and the percentage of Black voters moves to the Obama level of 95 percent, then she will win that state. To be sure, in those states-and, indeed all states with large numbers of people of color-a major challenge will be overcoming the widespread voter-suppression measures that have proliferated in recent years.\n\nSomething profound, historic, and transformative is sweeping the nation. You see it in the faces of the people attending Harris rallies, the astounding number of dollars pouring into her campaign coffers, and the surge in voter registration and volunteers since she took control of the ticket. A race-conscious approach to analyzing the underlying data both affirms the significance of what is bubbling up across the country and points to the very real possibility that the electoral map is much larger than people realize. The entire set of Obama-won states is in play, and Kamala Harris could win even more states than many realize, including North Carolina and Florida.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts.

Black politicians have lined up in droves to endorse her, eager to prove their loyalty to the Clintons in the hopes that their faithfulness will be remembered and rewarded. Black pastors are opening their church doors, and the Clintons are making themselves comfortably at home once again, engaging effortlessly in all the usual rituals associated with \"courting the black vote,\" a pursuit that typically begins and ends with Democratic politicians making black people feel liked and taken seriously. Doing something concrete to improve the conditions under which most black people live is generally not required. Hillary is looking to gain momentum on the campaign trail as the primaries move out of Iowa and New Hampshire and into states like South Carolina, where large pockets of black voters can be found. According to some polls, she leads Bernie Sanders by as much as 60 percent among African Americans. It seems that we-black people-are her winning card, one that Hillary is eager to play. And it seems we're eager to get played. Again. The love affair between black folks and the Clintons has been going on for a long time. It began back in 1992, when Bill Clinton was running for president. He threw on some shades and played the saxophone on The Arsenio Hall Show . It seems silly in retrospect, but many of us fell for that. At a time when a popular slogan was \"It's a black thing, you wouldn't understand,\" Bill Clinton seemed to get us. When Toni Morrison dubbed him our first black president, we nodded our heads. We had our boy in the White House. Or at least we thought we did. Black voters have been remarkably loyal to the Clintons for more than 25 years. It's true that we eventually lined up behind Barack Obama in 2008, but it's a measure of the Clinton allure that Hillary led Obama among black voters until he started winning caucuses and primaries. Now Hillary is running again. This time she's facing a democratic socialist who promises a political revolution that will bring universal healthcare, a living wage, an end to rampant Wall Street greed, and the dismantling of the vast prison state-many of the same goals that Martin Luther King Jr. championed at the end of his life. Even so, black folks are sticking with the Clinton brand. What have the Clintons done to earn such devotion? Did they take extreme political risks to defend the rights of African Americans? Did they courageously stand up to right-wing demagoguery about black communities? Did they help usher in a new era of hope and prosperity for neighborhoods devastated by deindustrialization, globalization, and the disappearance of work? No. Quite the opposite. * * * When Bill Clinton ran for president in 1992, urban black communities across America were suffering from economic collapse. Hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs had vanished as factories moved overseas in search of cheaper labor, a new plantation. Globalization and deindustrialization affected workers of all colors but hit African Americans particularly hard. Unemployment rates among young black men had quadrupled as the rate of industrial employment plummeted. Crime rates spiked in inner-city communities that had been dependent on factory jobs, while hopelessness, despair, and crack addiction swept neighborhoods that had once been solidly working-class. Millions of black folks-many of whom had fled Jim Crow segregation in the South with the hope of obtaining decent work in Northern factories-were suddenly trapped in racially segregated, jobless ghettos.

In practice, however, he capitulated entirely to the right-wing backlash against the civil-rights movement and embraced former president Ronald Reagan's agenda on race, crime, welfare, and taxes-ultimately doing more harm to black communities than Reagan ever did. We should have seen it coming. Back then, Clinton was the standard-bearer for the New Democrats, a group that firmly believed the only way to win back the millions of white voters in the South who had defected to the Republican Party was to adopt the right-wing narrative that black communities ought to be disciplined with harsh punishment rather than coddled with welfare. Reagan had won the presidency by dog-whistling to poor and working-class whites with coded racial appeals: railing against \"welfare queens\" and criminal \"predators\" and condemning \"big government.\" Clinton aimed to win them back, vowing that he would never permit any Republican to be perceived as tougher on crime than he. Just weeks before the critical New Hampshire primary, Clinton proved his toughness by flying back to Arkansas to oversee the execution of Ricky Ray Rector, a mentally impaired black man who had so little conception of what was about to happen to him that he asked for the dessert from his last meal to be saved for him for later. After the execution, Clinton remarked, \"I can be nicked a lot, but no one can say I'm soft on crime.\" As president, Bill Clinton mastered the art of sending mixed cultural messages. Clinton mastered the art of sending mixed cultural messages, appealing to African Americans by belting out \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" in black churches, while at the same time signaling to poor and working-class whites that he was willing to be tougher on black communities than Republicans had been. Clinton was praised for his no-nonsense, pragmatic approach to racial politics. He won the election and appointed a racially diverse cabinet that \"looked like America.\" He won re-election four years later, and the American economy rebounded. Democrats cheered. The Democratic Party had been saved. The Clintons won. Guess who lost? * * * Bill Clinton presided over the largest increase in federal and state prison inmates of any president in American history. Clinton did not declare the War on Crime or the War on Drugs-those wars were declared before Reagan was elected and long before crack hit the streets-but he escalated it beyond what many conservatives had imagined possible. He supported the 100-to-1 sentencing disparity for crack versus powder cocaine, which produced staggering racial injustice in sentencing and boosted funding for drug-law enforcement. Clinton championed the idea of a federal \"three strikes\" law in his 1994 State of the Union address and, months later, signed a $30 billion crime bill that created dozens of new federal capital crimes, mandated life sentences for some three-time offenders, and authorized more than $16 billion for state prison grants and the expansion of police forces. The legislation was hailed by mainstream-media outlets as a victory for the Democrats, who \"were able to wrest the crime issue from the Republicans and make it their own.\" When Clinton left office in 2001, the United States had the highest rate of incarceration in the world. Human Rights Watch reported that in seven states, African Americans constituted 80 to 90 percent of all drug offenders sent to prison, even though they were no more likely than whites to use or sell illegal drugs. Prison admissions for drug offenses reached a level in 2000 for African Americans more than 26 times the level in 1983. All of the presidents since 1980 have contributed to mass incarceration, but as Equal Justice Initiative founder Bryan Stevenson recently observed, \"President Clinton's tenure was the worst.\" Some might argue that it's unfair to judge Hillary Clinton for the policies her husband championed years ago. But Hillary wasn't picking out china while she was first lady. She bravely broke the mold and redefined that job in ways no woman ever had before. She not only campaigned for Bill; she also wielded power and significant influence once he was elected, lobbying for legislation and other measures. That record, and her statements from that era, should be scrutinized. In her support for the 1994 crime bill, for example, she used racially coded rhetoric to cast black children as animals. \"They are not just gangs of kids anymore,\" she said. \"They are often the kinds of kids that are called 'super-predators.' No conscience, no empathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first we have to bring them to heel.\" Both Clintons now express regret over the crime bill, and Hillary says she supports criminal-justice reforms to undo some of the damage that was done by her husband's administration. But on the campaign trail, she continues to invoke the economy and country that Bill Clinton left behind as a legacy she would continue. So what exactly did the Clinton economy look like for black Americans? Taking a hard look at this recent past is about more than just a choice between two candidates. It's about whether the Democratic Party can finally reckon with what its policies have done to African-American communities, and whether it can redeem itself and rightly earn the loyalty of black voters. * * * An oft-repeated myth about the Clinton administration is that although it was overly tough on crime back in the 1990s, at least its policies were good for the economy and for black unemployment rates. The truth is more troubling. As unemployment rates sank to historically low levels for white Americans in the 1990s, the jobless rate among black men in their 20s who didn't have a college degree rose to its highest level ever. This increase in joblessness was propelled by the skyrocketing incarceration rate. Why is this not common knowledge? Because government statistics like poverty and unemployment rates do not include incarcerated people. As Harvard sociologist Bruce Western explains: \"Much of the optimism about declines in racial inequality and the power of the US model of economic growth is misplaced once we account for the invisible poor, behind the walls of America's prisons and jails.\" When Clinton left office in 2001, the true jobless rate for young, non-college-educated black men (including those behind bars) was 42 percent. This figure was never reported. Instead, the media claimed that unemployment rates for African Americans had fallen to record lows, neglecting to mention that this miracle was possible only because incarceration rates were now at record highs. Young black men weren't looking for work at high rates during the Clinton era because they were now behind bars-out of sight, out of mind, and no longer counted in poverty and unemployment statistics. To make matters worse, the federal safety net for poor families was torn to shreds by the Clinton administration in its effort to \"end welfare as we know it.\" In his 1996 State of the Union address, given during his re-election campaign, Clinton declared that \"the era of big government is over\" and immediately sought to prove it by dismantling the federal welfare system known as Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC). The welfare-reform legislation that he signed-which Hillary Clinton ardently supported then and characterized as a success as recently as 2008-replaced the federal safety net with a block grant to the states, imposed a five-year lifetime limit on welfare assistance, added work requirements, barred undocumented immigrants from licensed professions, and slashed overall public welfare funding by $54 billion (some was later restored). They are not just gangs of kids anymore...they are 'super-predators.' -Hillary Clinton, speaking in support of the 1994 crime bill Experts and pundits disagree about the true impact of welfare reform, but one thing seems clear: Extreme poverty doubled to 1.5 million in the decade and a half after the law was passed. What is extreme poverty? US households are considered to be in extreme poverty if they are surviving on cash incomes of no more than $2 per person per day in any given month. We tend to think of extreme poverty existing in Third World countries, but here in the United States, shocking numbers of people are struggling to survive on less money per month than many families spend in one evening dining out. Currently, the United States, the richest nation on the planet, has one of the highest child-poverty rates in the developed world. Despite claims that radical changes in crime and welfare policy were driven by a desire to end big government and save taxpayer dollars, the reality is that the Clinton administration didn't reduce the amount of money devoted to the management of the urban poor; it changed what the funds would be used for. Billions of dollars were slashed from public-housing and child-welfare budgets and transferred to the mass-incarceration machine. By 1996, the penal budget was twice the amount that had been allocated to food stamps. During Clinton's tenure, funding for public housing was slashed by $17 billion (a reduction of 61 percent), while funding for corrections was boosted by $19 billion (an increase of 171 percent), according to sociologist Loïc Wacquant \"effectively making the construction of prisons the nation's main housing program for the urban poor.\" Bill Clinton championed discriminatory laws against formerly incarcerated people that have kept millions of Americans locked in a cycle of poverty and desperation. The Clinton administration eliminated Pell grants for prisoners seeking higher education to prepare for their release, supported laws denying federal financial aid to students with drug convictions, and signed legislation imposing a lifetime ban on welfare and food stamps for anyone convicted of a felony drug offense-an exceptionally harsh provision given the racially biased drug war that was raging in inner cities. Perhaps most alarming, Clinton also made it easier for public-housing agencies to deny shelter to anyone with any sort of criminal history (even an arrest without conviction) and championed the \"one strike and you're out\" initiative, which meant that families could be evicted from public housing because one member (or a guest) had committed even a minor offense. People released from prison with no money, no job, and nowhere to go could no longer return home to their loved ones living in federally assisted housing without placing the entire family at risk of eviction. Purging \"the criminal element\" from public housing played well on the evening news, but no provisions were made for people and families as they were forced out on the street. By the end of Clinton's presidency, more than half of working-age African-American men in many large urban areas were saddled with criminal records and subject to legalized discrimination in employment, housing, access to education, and basic public benefits-relegated to a permanent second-class status eerily reminiscent of Jim Crow. It is difficult to overstate the damage that's been done. Generations have been lost to the prison system; countless families have been torn apart or rendered homeless; and a school-to-prison pipeline has been born that shuttles young people from their decrepit, underfunded schools to brand-new high-tech prisons. * * * It didn't have to be like this. As a nation, we had a choice. Rather than spending billions of dollars constructing a vast new penal system, those billions could have been spent putting young people to work in inner-city communities and investing in their schools so they might have some hope of making the transition from an industrial to a service-based economy. Constructive interventions would have been good not only for African Americans trapped in ghettos, but for blue-collar workers of all colors. At the very least, Democrats could have fought to prevent the further destruction of black communities rather than ratcheting up the wars declared on them. Of course, it can be said that it's unfair to criticize the Clintons for punishing black people so harshly, given that many black people were on board with the \"get tough\" movement too. It is absolutely true that black communities back then were in a state of crisis, and that many black activists and politicians were desperate to get violent offenders off the streets. What is often missed, however, is that most of those black activists and politicians weren't asking only for toughness. They were also demanding investment in their schools, better housing, jobs programs for young people, economic-stimulus packages, drug treatment on demand, and better access to healthcare. In the end, they wound up with police and prisons. To say that this was what black people wanted is misleading at best. By 1996, the penal budget was twice the amount that had been allocated to food stamps. To be fair, the Clintons now feel bad about how their politics and policies have worked out for black people. Bill says that he \"overshot the mark\" with his crime policies; and Hillary has put forth a plan to ban racial profiling, eliminate the sentencing disparities between crack and cocaine, and abolish private prisons, among other measures. But what about a larger agenda that would not just reverse some of the policies adopted during the Clinton era, but would rebuild the communities decimated by them? If you listen closely here, you'll notice that Hillary Clinton is still singing the same old tune in a slightly different key. She is arguing that we ought not be seduced by Bernie's rhetoric because we must be \"pragmatic,\" \"face political realities,\" and not get tempted to believe that we can fight for economic justice and win. When politicians start telling you that it is \"unrealistic\" to support candidates who want to build a movement for greater equality, fair wages, universal healthcare, and an end to corporate control of our political system, it's probably best to leave the room. This is not an endorsement for Bernie Sanders, who after all voted for the 1994 crime bill. I also tend to agree with Ta-Nehisi Coates that the way the Sanders campaign handled the question of reparations is one of many signs that Bernie doesn't quite get what's at stake in serious dialogues about racial justice. He was wrong to dismiss reparations as \"divisive,\" as though centuries of slavery, segregation, discrimination, ghettoization, and stigmatization aren't worthy of any specific acknowledgement or remedy. But recognizing that Bernie, like Hillary, has blurred vision when it comes to race is not the same thing as saying their views are equally problematic. Sanders opposed the 1996 welfare-reform law. He also opposed bank deregulation and the Iraq War, both of which Hillary supported, and both of which have proved disastrous. In short, there is such a thing as a lesser evil, and Hillary is not it. The biggest problem with Bernie, in the end, is that he's running as a Democrat-as a member of a political party that not only capitulated to right-wing demagoguery but is now owned and controlled by a relatively small number of millionaires and billionaires. Yes, Sanders has raised millions from small donors, but should he become president, he would also become part of what he has otherwise derided as \"the establishment.\" Even if Bernie's racial-justice views evolve, I hold little hope that a political revolution will occur within the Democratic Party without a sustained outside movement forcing truly transformational change. I am inclined to believe that it would be easier to build a new party than to save the Democratic Party from itself. LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS Email Of course, the idea of building a new political party terrifies most progressives, who understandably fear that it would open the door for a right-wing extremist to get elected.

Du Bois, the eminent scholar and co-founder of the NAACP, shocked many when he refused to play along with this game in the 1956 election, defending his refusal to vote on the grounds that \"there is but one evil party with two names, and it will be elected despite all I do or say.\" While the true losers and winners of this game are highly predictable, the game of lesser evils makes for great entertainment and can now be viewed 24 hours a day on cable-news networks. Hillary believes that she can win this game in 2016 because this time she's got us, the black vote, in her back pocket-her lucky card. She may be surprised to discover that the younger generation no longer wants to play her game. Or maybe not. Maybe we'll all continue to play along and pretend that we don't know how it will turn out in the end. Hopefully, one day, we'll muster the courage to join together in a revolutionary movement with people of all colors who believe that basic human rights and economic, racial, and gender justice are not unreasonable, pie-in-the-sky goals. After decades of getting played, the sleeping giant just might wake up, stretch its limbs, and tell both parties: Game over. Move aside. It's time to reshuffle this deck.\n\nHillary is looking to gain momentum on the campaign trail as the primaries move out of Iowa and New Hampshire and into states like South Carolina, where large pockets of black voters can be found. According to some polls, she leads Bernie Sanders by as much as 60 percent among African Americans. It seems that we-black people-are her winning card, one that Hillary is eager to play. And it seems we're eager to get played. Again. The love affair between black folks and the Clintons has been going on for a long time. It began back in 1992, when Bill Clinton was running for president. He threw on some shades and played the saxophone on The Arsenio Hall Show . It seems silly in retrospect, but many of us fell for that. At a time when a popular slogan was \"It's a black thing, you wouldn't understand,\" Bill Clinton seemed to get us. When Toni Morrison dubbed him our first black president, we nodded our heads. We had our boy in the White House. Or at least we thought we did. Black voters have been remarkably loyal to the Clintons for more than 25 years. It's true that we eventually lined up behind Barack Obama in 2008, but it's a measure of the Clinton allure that Hillary led Obama among black voters until he started winning caucuses and primaries. Now Hillary is running again. This time she's facing a democratic socialist who promises a political revolution that will bring universal healthcare, a living wage, an end to rampant Wall Street greed, and the dismantling of the vast prison state-many of the same goals that Martin Luther King Jr. championed at the end of his life. Even so, black folks are sticking with the Clinton brand. What have the Clintons done to earn such devotion? Did they take extreme political risks to defend the rights of African Americans? Did they courageously stand up to right-wing demagoguery about black communities? Did they help usher in a new era of hope and prosperity for neighborhoods devastated by deindustrialization, globalization, and the disappearance of work? No. Quite the opposite. * * * When Bill Clinton ran for president in 1992, urban black communities across America were suffering from economic collapse. Hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs had vanished as factories moved overseas in search of cheaper labor, a new plantation. Globalization and deindustrialization affected workers of all colors but hit African Americans particularly hard. Unemployment rates among young black men had quadrupled as the rate of industrial employment plummeted. Crime rates spiked in inner-city communities that had been dependent on factory jobs, while hopelessness, despair, and crack addiction swept neighborhoods that had once been solidly working-class. Millions of black folks-many of whom had fled Jim Crow segregation in the South with the hope of obtaining decent work in Northern factories-were suddenly trapped in racially segregated, jobless ghettos.

In practice, however, he capitulated entirely to the right-wing backlash against the civil-rights movement and embraced former president Ronald Reagan's agenda on race, crime, welfare, and taxes-ultimately doing more harm to black communities than Reagan ever did. We should have seen it coming. Back then, Clinton was the standard-bearer for the New Democrats, a group that firmly believed the only way to win back the millions of white voters in the South who had defected to the Republican Party was to adopt the right-wing narrative that black communities ought to be disciplined with harsh punishment rather than coddled with welfare. Reagan had won the presidency by dog-whistling to poor and working-class whites with coded racial appeals: railing against \"welfare queens\" and criminal \"predators\" and condemning \"big government.\" Clinton aimed to win them back, vowing that he would never permit any Republican to be perceived as tougher on crime than he. Just weeks before the critical New Hampshire primary, Clinton proved his toughness by flying back to Arkansas to oversee the execution of Ricky Ray Rector, a mentally impaired black man who had so little conception of what was about to happen to him that he asked for the dessert from his last meal to be saved for him for later. After the execution, Clinton remarked, \"I can be nicked a lot, but no one can say I'm soft on crime.\" As president, Bill Clinton mastered the art of sending mixed cultural messages. Clinton mastered the art of sending mixed cultural messages, appealing to African Americans by belting out \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" in black churches, while at the same time signaling to poor and working-class whites that he was willing to be tougher on black communities than Republicans had been. Clinton was praised for his no-nonsense, pragmatic approach to racial politics. He won the election and appointed a racially diverse cabinet that \"looked like America.\" He won re-election four years later, and the American economy rebounded. Democrats cheered. The Democratic Party had been saved. The Clintons won. Guess who lost? * * * Bill Clinton presided over the largest increase in federal and state prison inmates of any president in American history. Clinton did not declare the War on Crime or the War on Drugs-those wars were declared before Reagan was elected and long before crack hit the streets-but he escalated it beyond what many conservatives had imagined possible. He supported the 100-to-1 sentencing disparity for crack versus powder cocaine, which produced staggering racial injustice in sentencing and boosted funding for drug-law enforcement. Clinton championed the idea of a federal \"three strikes\" law in his 1994 State of the Union address and, months later, signed a $30 billion crime bill that created dozens of new federal capital crimes, mandated life sentences for some three-time offenders, and authorized more than $16 billion for state prison grants and the expansion of police forces. The legislation was hailed by mainstream-media outlets as a victory for the Democrats, who \"were able to wrest the crime issue from the Republicans and make it their own.\" When Clinton left office in 2001, the United States had the highest rate of incarceration in the world. Human Rights Watch reported that in seven states, African Americans constituted 80 to 90 percent of all drug offenders sent to prison, even though they were no more likely than whites to use or sell illegal drugs. Prison admissions for drug offenses reached a level in 2000 for African Americans more than 26 times the level in 1983. All of the presidents since 1980 have contributed to mass incarceration, but as Equal Justice Initiative founder Bryan Stevenson recently observed, \"President Clinton's tenure was the worst.\" Some might argue that it's unfair to judge Hillary Clinton for the policies her husband championed years ago. But Hillary wasn't picking out china while she was first lady. She bravely broke the mold and redefined that job in ways no woman ever had before. She not only campaigned for Bill; she also wielded power and significant influence once he was elected, lobbying for legislation and other measures. That record, and her statements from that era, should be scrutinized. In her support for the 1994 crime bill, for example, she used racially coded rhetoric to cast black children as animals. \"They are not just gangs of kids anymore,\" she said. \"They are often the kinds of kids that are called 'super-predators.' No conscience, no empathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first we have to bring them to heel.\" Both Clintons now express regret over the crime bill, and Hillary says she supports criminal-justice reforms to undo some of the damage that was done by her husband's administration. But on the campaign trail, she continues to invoke the economy and country that Bill Clinton left behind as a legacy she would continue. So what exactly did the Clinton economy look like for black Americans? Taking a hard look at this recent past is about more than just a choice between two candidates. It's about whether the Democratic Party can finally reckon with what its policies have done to African-American communities, and whether it can redeem itself and rightly earn the loyalty of black voters. * * * An oft-repeated myth about the Clinton administration is that although it was overly tough on crime back in the 1990s, at least its policies were good for the economy and for black unemployment rates. The truth is more troubling. As unemployment rates sank to historically low levels for white Americans in the 1990s, the jobless rate among black men in their 20s who didn't have a college degree rose to its highest level ever. This increase in joblessness was propelled by the skyrocketing incarceration rate. Why is this not common knowledge? Because government statistics like poverty and unemployment rates do not include incarcerated people. As Harvard sociologist Bruce Western explains: \"Much of the optimism about declines in racial inequality and the power of the US model of economic growth is misplaced once we account for the invisible poor, behind the walls of America's prisons and jails.\" When Clinton left office in 2001, the true jobless rate for young, non-college-educated black men (including those behind bars) was 42 percent. This figure was never reported. Instead, the media claimed that unemployment rates for African Americans had fallen to record lows, neglecting to mention that this miracle was possible only because incarceration rates were now at record highs. Young black men weren't looking for work at high rates during the Clinton era because they were now behind bars-out of sight, out of mind, and no longer counted in poverty and unemployment statistics. To make matters worse, the federal safety net for poor families was torn to shreds by the Clinton administration in its effort to \"end welfare as we know it.\" In his 1996 State of the Union address, given during his re-election campaign, Clinton declared that \"the era of big government is over\" and immediately sought to prove it by dismantling the federal welfare system known as Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC). The welfare-reform legislation that he signed-which Hillary Clinton ardently supported then and characterized as a success as recently as 2008-replaced the federal safety net with a block grant to the states, imposed a five-year lifetime limit on welfare assistance, added work requirements, barred undocumented immigrants from licensed professions, and slashed overall public welfare funding by $54 billion (some was later restored). They are not just gangs of kids anymore...they are 'super-predators.' -Hillary Clinton, speaking in support of the 1994 crime bill Experts and pundits disagree about the true impact of welfare reform, but one thing seems clear: Extreme poverty doubled to 1.5 million in the decade and a half after the law was passed. What is extreme poverty? US households are considered to be in extreme poverty if they are surviving on cash incomes of no more than $2 per person per day in any given month. We tend to think of extreme poverty existing in Third World countries, but here in the United States, shocking numbers of people are struggling to survive on less money per month than many families spend in one evening dining out. Currently, the United States, the richest nation on the planet, has one of the highest child-poverty rates in the developed world. Despite claims that radical changes in crime and welfare policy were driven by a desire to end big government and save taxpayer dollars, the reality is that the Clinton administration didn't reduce the amount of money devoted to the management of the urban poor; it changed what the funds would be used for. Billions of dollars were slashed from public-housing and child-welfare budgets and transferred to the mass-incarceration machine. By 1996, the penal budget was twice the amount that had been allocated to food stamps. During Clinton's tenure, funding for public housing was slashed by $17 billion (a reduction of 61 percent), while funding for corrections was boosted by $19 billion (an increase of 171 percent), according to sociologist Loïc Wacquant \"effectively making the construction of prisons the nation's main housing program for the urban poor.\" Bill Clinton championed discriminatory laws against formerly incarcerated people that have kept millions of Americans locked in a cycle of poverty and desperation. The Clinton administration eliminated Pell grants for prisoners seeking higher education to prepare for their release, supported laws denying federal financial aid to students with drug convictions, and signed legislation imposing a lifetime ban on welfare and food stamps for anyone convicted of a felony drug offense-an exceptionally harsh provision given the racially biased drug war that was raging in inner cities. Perhaps most alarming, Clinton also made it easier for public-housing agencies to deny shelter to anyone with any sort of criminal history (even an arrest without conviction) and championed the \"one strike and you're out\" initiative, which meant that families could be evicted from public housing because one member (or a guest) had committed even a minor offense. People released from prison with no money, no job, and nowhere to go could no longer return home to their loved ones living in federally assisted housing without placing the entire family at risk of eviction. Purging \"the criminal element\" from public housing played well on the evening news, but no provisions were made for people and families as they were forced out on the street. By the end of Clinton's presidency, more than half of working-age African-American men in many large urban areas were saddled with criminal records and subject to legalized discrimination in employment, housing, access to education, and basic public benefits-relegated to a permanent second-class status eerily reminiscent of Jim Crow. It is difficult to overstate the damage that's been done. Generations have been lost to the prison system; countless families have been torn apart or rendered homeless; and a school-to-prison pipeline has been born that shuttles young people from their decrepit, underfunded schools to brand-new high-tech prisons. * * * It didn't have to be like this. As a nation, we had a choice. Rather than spending billions of dollars constructing a vast new penal system, those billions could have been spent putting young people to work in inner-city communities and investing in their schools so they might have some hope of making the transition from an industrial to a service-based economy. Constructive interventions would have been good not only for African Americans trapped in ghettos, but for blue-collar workers of all colors. At the very least, Democrats could have fought to prevent the further destruction of black communities rather than ratcheting up the wars declared on them. Of course, it can be said that it's unfair to criticize the Clintons for punishing black people so harshly, given that many black people were on board with the \"get tough\" movement too. It is absolutely true that black communities back then were in a state of crisis, and that many black activists and politicians were desperate to get violent offenders off the streets. What is often missed, however, is that most of those black activists and politicians weren't asking only for toughness. They were also demanding investment in their schools, better housing, jobs programs for young people, economic-stimulus packages, drug treatment on demand, and better access to healthcare. In the end, they wound up with police and prisons. To say that this was what black people wanted is misleading at best. By 1996, the penal budget was twice the amount that had been allocated to food stamps. To be fair, the Clintons now feel bad about how their politics and policies have worked out for black people. Bill says that he \"overshot the mark\" with his crime policies; and Hillary has put forth a plan to ban racial profiling, eliminate the sentencing disparities between crack and cocaine, and abolish private prisons, among other measures. But what about a larger agenda that would not just reverse some of the policies adopted during the Clinton era, but would rebuild the communities decimated by them? If you listen closely here, you'll notice that Hillary Clinton is still singing the same old tune in a slightly different key. She is arguing that we ought not be seduced by Bernie's rhetoric because we must be \"pragmatic,\" \"face political realities,\" and not get tempted to believe that we can fight for economic justice and win. When politicians start telling you that it is \"unrealistic\" to support candidates who want to build a movement for greater equality, fair wages, universal healthcare, and an end to corporate control of our political system, it's probably best to leave the room. This is not an endorsement for Bernie Sanders, who after all voted for the 1994 crime bill. I also tend to agree with Ta-Nehisi Coates that the way the Sanders campaign handled the question of reparations is one of many signs that Bernie doesn't quite get what's at stake in serious dialogues about racial justice. He was wrong to dismiss reparations as \"divisive,\" as though centuries of slavery, segregation, discrimination, ghettoization, and stigmatization aren't worthy of any specific acknowledgement or remedy. But recognizing that Bernie, like Hillary, has blurred vision when it comes to race is not the same thing as saying their views are equally problematic. Sanders opposed the 1996 welfare-reform law. He also opposed bank deregulation and the Iraq War, both of which Hillary supported, and both of which have proved disastrous. In short, there is such a thing as a lesser evil, and Hillary is not it. The biggest problem with Bernie, in the end, is that he's running as a Democrat-as a member of a political party that not only capitulated to right-wing demagoguery but is now owned and controlled by a relatively small number of millionaires and billionaires. Yes, Sanders has raised millions from small donors, but should he become president, he would also become part of what he has otherwise derided as \"the establishment.\" Even if Bernie's racial-justice views evolve, I hold little hope that a political revolution will occur within the Democratic Party without a sustained outside movement forcing truly transformational change. I am inclined to believe that it would be easier to build a new party than to save the Democratic Party from itself. LIKE THIS?

Rather than spending billions of dollars constructing a vast new penal system, those billions could have been spent putting young people to work in inner-city communities and investing in their schools so they might have some hope of making the transition from an industrial to a service-based economy. Constructive interventions would have been good not only for African Americans trapped in ghettos, but for blue-collar workers of all colors. At the very least, Democrats could have fought to prevent the further destruction of black communities rather than ratcheting up the wars declared on them. Of course, it can be said that it's unfair to criticize the Clintons for punishing black people so harshly, given that many black people were on board with the \"get tough\" movement too. It is absolutely true that black communities back then were in a state of crisis, and that many black activists and politicians were desperate to get violent offenders off the streets. What is often missed, however, is that most of those black activists and politicians weren't asking only for toughness. They were also demanding investment in their schools, better housing, jobs programs for young people, economic-stimulus packages, drug treatment on demand, and better access to healthcare. In the end, they wound up with police and prisons. To say that this was what black people wanted is misleading at best. By 1996, the penal budget was twice the amount that had been allocated to food stamps. To be fair, the Clintons now feel bad about how their politics and policies have worked out for black people. Bill says that he \"overshot the mark\" with his crime policies; and Hillary has put forth a plan to ban racial profiling, eliminate the sentencing disparities between crack and cocaine, and abolish private prisons, among other measures. But what about a larger agenda that would not just reverse some of the policies adopted during the Clinton era, but would rebuild the communities decimated by them? If you listen closely here, you'll notice that Hillary Clinton is still singing the same old tune in a slightly different key. She is arguing that we ought not be seduced by Bernie's rhetoric because we must be \"pragmatic,\" \"face political realities,\" and not get tempted to believe that we can fight for economic justice and win. When politicians start telling you that it is \"unrealistic\" to support candidates who want to build a movement for greater equality, fair wages, universal healthcare, and an end to corporate control of our political system, it's probably best to leave the room. This is not an endorsement for Bernie Sanders, who after all voted for the 1994 crime bill. I also tend to agree with Ta-Nehisi Coates that the way the Sanders campaign handled the question of reparations is one of many signs that Bernie doesn't quite get what's at stake in serious dialogues about racial justice. He was wrong to dismiss reparations as \"divisive,\" as though centuries of slavery, segregation, discrimination, ghettoization, and stigmatization aren't worthy of any specific acknowledgement or remedy. But recognizing that Bernie, like Hillary, has blurred vision when it comes to race is not the same thing as saying their views are equally problematic. Sanders opposed the 1996 welfare-reform law. He also opposed bank deregulation and the Iraq War, both of which Hillary supported, and both of which have proved disastrous. In short, there is such a thing as a lesser evil, and Hillary is not it. The biggest problem with Bernie, in the end, is that he's running as a Democrat-as a member of a political party that not only capitulated to right-wing demagoguery but is now owned and controlled by a relatively small number of millionaires and billionaires. Yes, Sanders has raised millions from small donors, but should he become president, he would also become part of what he has otherwise derided as \"the establishment.\" Even if Bernie's racial-justice views evolve, I hold little hope that a political revolution will occur within the Democratic Party without a sustained outside movement forcing truly transformational change. I am inclined to believe that it would be easier to build a new party than to save the Democratic Party from itself. LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS Email Of course, the idea of building a new political party terrifies most progressives, who understandably fear that it would open the door for a right-wing extremist to get elected. So we play the game of lesser evils. This game has gone on for decades. W.E.B. Du Bois, the eminent scholar and co-founder of the NAACP, shocked many when he refused to play along with this game in the 1956 election, defending his refusal to vote on the grounds that \"there is but one evil party with two names, and it will be elected despite all I do or say.\" While the true losers and winners of this game are highly predictable, the game of lesser evils makes for great entertainment and can now be viewed 24 hours a day on cable-news networks. Hillary believes that she can win this game in 2016 because this time she's got us, the black vote, in her back pocket-her lucky card. She may be surprised to discover that the younger generation no longer wants to play her game. Or maybe not. Maybe we'll all continue to play along and pretend that we don't know how it will turn out in the end. Hopefully, one day, we'll muster the courage to join together in a revolutionary movement with people of all colors who believe that basic human rights and economic, racial, and gender justice are not unreasonable, pie-in-the-sky goals. After decades of getting played, the sleeping giant just might wake up, stretch its limbs, and tell both parties: Game over. Move aside. It's time to reshuffle this deck.\n\nThe love affair between black folks and the Clintons has been going on for a long time. It began back in 1992, when Bill Clinton was running for president. He threw on some shades and played the saxophone on The Arsenio Hall Show . It seems silly in retrospect, but many of us fell for that. At a time when a popular slogan was \"It's a black thing, you wouldn't understand,\" Bill Clinton seemed to get us. When Toni Morrison dubbed him our first black president, we nodded our heads. We had our boy in the White House. Or at least we thought we did. Black voters have been remarkably loyal to the Clintons for more than 25 years. It's true that we eventually lined up behind Barack Obama in 2008, but it's a measure of the Clinton allure that Hillary led Obama among black voters until he started winning caucuses and primaries. Now Hillary is running again. This time she's facing a democratic socialist who promises a political revolution that will bring universal healthcare, a living wage, an end to rampant Wall Street greed, and the dismantling of the vast prison state-many of the same goals that Martin Luther King Jr. championed at the end of his life. Even so, black folks are sticking with the Clinton brand. What have the Clintons done to earn such devotion? Did they take extreme political risks to defend the rights of African Americans? Did they courageously stand up to right-wing demagoguery about black communities? Did they help usher in a new era of hope and prosperity for neighborhoods devastated by deindustrialization, globalization, and the disappearance of work? No. Quite the opposite. * * * When Bill Clinton ran for president in 1992, urban black communities across America were suffering from economic collapse. Hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs had vanished as factories moved overseas in search of cheaper labor, a new plantation. Globalization and deindustrialization affected workers of all colors but hit African Americans particularly hard. Unemployment rates among young black men had quadrupled as the rate of industrial employment plummeted. Crime rates spiked in inner-city communities that had been dependent on factory jobs, while hopelessness, despair, and crack addiction swept neighborhoods that had once been solidly working-class. Millions of black folks-many of whom had fled Jim Crow segregation in the South with the hope of obtaining decent work in Northern factories-were suddenly trapped in racially segregated, jobless ghettos.

In practice, however, he capitulated entirely to the right-wing backlash against the civil-rights movement and embraced former president Ronald Reagan's agenda on race, crime, welfare, and taxes-ultimately doing more harm to black communities than Reagan ever did. We should have seen it coming. Back then, Clinton was the standard-bearer for the New Democrats, a group that firmly believed the only way to win back the millions of white voters in the South who had defected to the Republican Party was to adopt the right-wing narrative that black communities ought to be disciplined with harsh punishment rather than coddled with welfare. Reagan had won the presidency by dog-whistling to poor and working-class whites with coded racial appeals: railing against \"welfare queens\" and criminal \"predators\" and condemning \"big government.\" Clinton aimed to win them back, vowing that he would never permit any Republican to be perceived as tougher on crime than he. Just weeks before the critical New Hampshire primary, Clinton proved his toughness by flying back to Arkansas to oversee the execution of Ricky Ray Rector, a mentally impaired black man who had so little conception of what was about to happen to him that he asked for the dessert from his last meal to be saved for him for later. After the execution, Clinton remarked, \"I can be nicked a lot, but no one can say I'm soft on crime.\" As president, Bill Clinton mastered the art of sending mixed cultural messages. Clinton mastered the art of sending mixed cultural messages, appealing to African Americans by belting out \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" in black churches, while at the same time signaling to poor and working-class whites that he was willing to be tougher on black communities than Republicans had been. Clinton was praised for his no-nonsense, pragmatic approach to racial politics. He won the election and appointed a racially diverse cabinet that \"looked like America.\" He won re-election four years later, and the American economy rebounded. Democrats cheered. The Democratic Party had been saved. The Clintons won. Guess who lost? * * * Bill Clinton presided over the largest increase in federal and state prison inmates of any president in American history. Clinton did not declare the War on Crime or the War on Drugs-those wars were declared before Reagan was elected and long before crack hit the streets-but he escalated it beyond what many conservatives had imagined possible. He supported the 100-to-1 sentencing disparity for crack versus powder cocaine, which produced staggering racial injustice in sentencing and boosted funding for drug-law enforcement. Clinton championed the idea of a federal \"three strikes\" law in his 1994 State of the Union address and, months later, signed a $30 billion crime bill that created dozens of new federal capital crimes, mandated life sentences for some three-time offenders, and authorized more than $16 billion for state prison grants and the expansion of police forces. The legislation was hailed by mainstream-media outlets as a victory for the Democrats, who \"were able to wrest the crime issue from the Republicans and make it their own.\" When Clinton left office in 2001, the United States had the highest rate of incarceration in the world. Human Rights Watch reported that in seven states, African Americans constituted 80 to 90 percent of all drug offenders sent to prison, even though they were no more likely than whites to use or sell illegal drugs. Prison admissions for drug offenses reached a level in 2000 for African Americans more than 26 times the level in 1983. All of the presidents since 1980 have contributed to mass incarceration, but as Equal Justice Initiative founder Bryan Stevenson recently observed, \"President Clinton's tenure was the worst.\" Some might argue that it's unfair to judge Hillary Clinton for the policies her husband championed years ago. But Hillary wasn't picking out china while she was first lady. She bravely broke the mold and redefined that job in ways no woman ever had before. She not only campaigned for Bill; she also wielded power and significant influence once he was elected, lobbying for legislation and other measures. That record, and her statements from that era, should be scrutinized. In her support for the 1994 crime bill, for example, she used racially coded rhetoric to cast black children as animals. \"They are not just gangs of kids anymore,\" she said. \"They are often the kinds of kids that are called 'super-predators.' No conscience, no empathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first we have to bring them to heel.\" Both Clintons now express regret over the crime bill, and Hillary says she supports criminal-justice reforms to undo some of the damage that was done by her husband's administration. But on the campaign trail, she continues to invoke the economy and country that Bill Clinton left behind as a legacy she would continue. So what exactly did the Clinton economy look like for black Americans? Taking a hard look at this recent past is about more than just a choice between two candidates. It's about whether the Democratic Party can finally reckon with what its policies have done to African-American communities, and whether it can redeem itself and rightly earn the loyalty of black voters. * * * An oft-repeated myth about the Clinton administration is that although it was overly tough on crime back in the 1990s, at least its policies were good for the economy and for black unemployment rates. The truth is more troubling. As unemployment rates sank to historically low levels for white Americans in the 1990s, the jobless rate among black men in their 20s who didn't have a college degree rose to its highest level ever. This increase in joblessness was propelled by the skyrocketing incarceration rate. Why is this not common knowledge? Because government statistics like poverty and unemployment rates do not include incarcerated people. As Harvard sociologist Bruce Western explains: \"Much of the optimism about declines in racial inequality and the power of the US model of economic growth is misplaced once we account for the invisible poor, behind the walls of America's prisons and jails.\" When Clinton left office in 2001, the true jobless rate for young, non-college-educated black men (including those behind bars) was 42 percent. This figure was never reported. Instead, the media claimed that unemployment rates for African Americans had fallen to record lows, neglecting to mention that this miracle was possible only because incarceration rates were now at record highs. Young black men weren't looking for work at high rates during the Clinton era because they were now behind bars-out of sight, out of mind, and no longer counted in poverty and unemployment statistics. To make matters worse, the federal safety net for poor families was torn to shreds by the Clinton administration in its effort to \"end welfare as we know it.\" In his 1996 State of the Union address, given during his re-election campaign, Clinton declared that \"the era of big government is over\" and immediately sought to prove it by dismantling the federal welfare system known as Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC). The welfare-reform legislation that he signed-which Hillary Clinton ardently supported then and characterized as a success as recently as 2008-replaced the federal safety net with a block grant to the states, imposed a five-year lifetime limit on welfare assistance, added work requirements, barred undocumented immigrants from licensed professions, and slashed overall public welfare funding by $54 billion (some was later restored). They are not just gangs of kids anymore...they are 'super-predators.' -Hillary Clinton, speaking in support of the 1994 crime bill Experts and pundits disagree about the true impact of welfare reform, but one thing seems clear: Extreme poverty doubled to 1.5 million in the decade and a half after the law was passed. What is extreme poverty? US households are considered to be in extreme poverty if they are surviving on cash incomes of no more than $2 per person per day in any given month. We tend to think of extreme poverty existing in Third World countries, but here in the United States, shocking numbers of people are struggling to survive on less money per month than many families spend in one evening dining out. Currently, the United States, the richest nation on the planet, has one of the highest child-poverty rates in the developed world. Despite claims that radical changes in crime and welfare policy were driven by a desire to end big government and save taxpayer dollars, the reality is that the Clinton administration didn't reduce the amount of money devoted to the management of the urban poor; it changed what the funds would be used for. Billions of dollars were slashed from public-housing and child-welfare budgets and transferred to the mass-incarceration machine. By 1996, the penal budget was twice the amount that had been allocated to food stamps. During Clinton's tenure, funding for public housing was slashed by $17 billion (a reduction of 61 percent), while funding for corrections was boosted by $19 billion (an increase of 171 percent), according to sociologist Loïc Wacquant \"effectively making the construction of prisons the nation's main housing program for the urban poor.\" Bill Clinton championed discriminatory laws against formerly incarcerated people that have kept millions of Americans locked in a cycle of poverty and desperation. The Clinton administration eliminated Pell grants for prisoners seeking higher education to prepare for their release, supported laws denying federal financial aid to students with drug convictions, and signed legislation imposing a lifetime ban on welfare and food stamps for anyone convicted of a felony drug offense-an exceptionally harsh provision given the racially biased drug war that was raging in inner cities. Perhaps most alarming, Clinton also made it easier for public-housing agencies to deny shelter to anyone with any sort of criminal history (even an arrest without conviction) and championed the \"one strike and you're out\" initiative, which meant that families could be evicted from public housing because one member (or a guest) had committed even a minor offense. People released from prison with no money, no job, and nowhere to go could no longer return home to their loved ones living in federally assisted housing without placing the entire family at risk of eviction. Purging \"the criminal element\" from public housing played well on the evening news, but no provisions were made for people and families as they were forced out on the street. By the end of Clinton's presidency, more than half of working-age African-American men in many large urban areas were saddled with criminal records and subject to legalized discrimination in employment, housing, access to education, and basic public benefits-relegated to a permanent second-class status eerily reminiscent of Jim Crow. It is difficult to overstate the damage that's been done. Generations have been lost to the prison system; countless families have been torn apart or rendered homeless; and a school-to-prison pipeline has been born that shuttles young people from their decrepit, underfunded schools to brand-new high-tech prisons. * * * It didn't have to be like this. As a nation, we had a choice. Rather than spending billions of dollars constructing a vast new penal system, those billions could have been spent putting young people to work in inner-city communities and investing in their schools so they might have some hope of making the transition from an industrial to a service-based economy.

They are not just gangs of kids anymore...they are 'super-predators.' -Hillary Clinton, speaking in support of the 1994 crime bill Experts and pundits disagree about the true impact of welfare reform, but one thing seems clear: Extreme poverty doubled to 1.5 million in the decade and a half after the law was passed. What is extreme poverty? US households are considered to be in extreme poverty if they are surviving on cash incomes of no more than $2 per person per day in any given month. We tend to think of extreme poverty existing in Third World countries, but here in the United States, shocking numbers of people are struggling to survive on less money per month than many families spend in one evening dining out. Currently, the United States, the richest nation on the planet, has one of the highest child-poverty rates in the developed world. Despite claims that radical changes in crime and welfare policy were driven by a desire to end big government and save taxpayer dollars, the reality is that the Clinton administration didn't reduce the amount of money devoted to the management of the urban poor; it changed what the funds would be used for. Billions of dollars were slashed from public-housing and child-welfare budgets and transferred to the mass-incarceration machine. By 1996, the penal budget was twice the amount that had been allocated to food stamps. During Clinton's tenure, funding for public housing was slashed by $17 billion (a reduction of 61 percent), while funding for corrections was boosted by $19 billion (an increase of 171 percent), according to sociologist Loïc Wacquant \"effectively making the construction of prisons the nation's main housing program for the urban poor.\" Bill Clinton championed discriminatory laws against formerly incarcerated people that have kept millions of Americans locked in a cycle of poverty and desperation. The Clinton administration eliminated Pell grants for prisoners seeking higher education to prepare for their release, supported laws denying federal financial aid to students with drug convictions, and signed legislation imposing a lifetime ban on welfare and food stamps for anyone convicted of a felony drug offense-an exceptionally harsh provision given the racially biased drug war that was raging in inner cities. Perhaps most alarming, Clinton also made it easier for public-housing agencies to deny shelter to anyone with any sort of criminal history (even an arrest without conviction) and championed the \"one strike and you're out\" initiative, which meant that families could be evicted from public housing because one member (or a guest) had committed even a minor offense. People released from prison with no money, no job, and nowhere to go could no longer return home to their loved ones living in federally assisted housing without placing the entire family at risk of eviction. Purging \"the criminal element\" from public housing played well on the evening news, but no provisions were made for people and families as they were forced out on the street. By the end of Clinton's presidency, more than half of working-age African-American men in many large urban areas were saddled with criminal records and subject to legalized discrimination in employment, housing, access to education, and basic public benefits-relegated to a permanent second-class status eerily reminiscent of Jim Crow. It is difficult to overstate the damage that's been done. Generations have been lost to the prison system; countless families have been torn apart or rendered homeless; and a school-to-prison pipeline has been born that shuttles young people from their decrepit, underfunded schools to brand-new high-tech prisons. * * * It didn't have to be like this. As a nation, we had a choice. Rather than spending billions of dollars constructing a vast new penal system, those billions could have been spent putting young people to work in inner-city communities and investing in their schools so they might have some hope of making the transition from an industrial to a service-based economy. Constructive interventions would have been good not only for African Americans trapped in ghettos, but for blue-collar workers of all colors. At the very least, Democrats could have fought to prevent the further destruction of black communities rather than ratcheting up the wars declared on them. Of course, it can be said that it's unfair to criticize the Clintons for punishing black people so harshly, given that many black people were on board with the \"get tough\" movement too. It is absolutely true that black communities back then were in a state of crisis, and that many black activists and politicians were desperate to get violent offenders off the streets. What is often missed, however, is that most of those black activists and politicians weren't asking only for toughness. They were also demanding investment in their schools, better housing, jobs programs for young people, economic-stimulus packages, drug treatment on demand, and better access to healthcare. In the end, they wound up with police and prisons. To say that this was what black people wanted is misleading at best. By 1996, the penal budget was twice the amount that had been allocated to food stamps. To be fair, the Clintons now feel bad about how their politics and policies have worked out for black people. Bill says that he \"overshot the mark\" with his crime policies; and Hillary has put forth a plan to ban racial profiling, eliminate the sentencing disparities between crack and cocaine, and abolish private prisons, among other measures. But what about a larger agenda that would not just reverse some of the policies adopted during the Clinton era, but would rebuild the communities decimated by them? If you listen closely here, you'll notice that Hillary Clinton is still singing the same old tune in a slightly different key. She is arguing that we ought not be seduced by Bernie's rhetoric because we must be \"pragmatic,\" \"face political realities,\" and not get tempted to believe that we can fight for economic justice and win. When politicians start telling you that it is \"unrealistic\" to support candidates who want to build a movement for greater equality, fair wages, universal healthcare, and an end to corporate control of our political system, it's probably best to leave the room. This is not an endorsement for Bernie Sanders, who after all voted for the 1994 crime bill. I also tend to agree with Ta-Nehisi Coates that the way the Sanders campaign handled the question of reparations is one of many signs that Bernie doesn't quite get what's at stake in serious dialogues about racial justice. He was wrong to dismiss reparations as \"divisive,\" as though centuries of slavery, segregation, discrimination, ghettoization, and stigmatization aren't worthy of any specific acknowledgement or remedy. But recognizing that Bernie, like Hillary, has blurred vision when it comes to race is not the same thing as saying their views are equally problematic. Sanders opposed the 1996 welfare-reform law. He also opposed bank deregulation and the Iraq War, both of which Hillary supported, and both of which have proved disastrous. In short, there is such a thing as a lesser evil, and Hillary is not it. The biggest problem with Bernie, in the end, is that he's running as a Democrat-as a member of a political party that not only capitulated to right-wing demagoguery but is now owned and controlled by a relatively small number of millionaires and billionaires. Yes, Sanders has raised millions from small donors, but should he become president, he would also become part of what he has otherwise derided as \"the establishment.\" Even if Bernie's racial-justice views evolve, I hold little hope that a political revolution will occur within the Democratic Party without a sustained outside movement forcing truly transformational change. I am inclined to believe that it would be easier to build a new party than to save the Democratic Party from itself. LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS Email Of course, the idea of building a new political party terrifies most progressives, who understandably fear that it would open the door for a right-wing extremist to get elected. So we play the game of lesser evils. This game has gone on for decades. W.E.B. Du Bois, the eminent scholar and co-founder of the NAACP, shocked many when he refused to play along with this game in the 1956 election, defending his refusal to vote on the grounds that \"there is but one evil party with two names, and it will be elected despite all I do or say.\" While the true losers and winners of this game are highly predictable, the game of lesser evils makes for great entertainment and can now be viewed 24 hours a day on cable-news networks. Hillary believes that she can win this game in 2016 because this time she's got us, the black vote, in her back pocket-her lucky card. She may be surprised to discover that the younger generation no longer wants to play her game. Or maybe not. Maybe we'll all continue to play along and pretend that we don't know how it will turn out in the end. Hopefully, one day, we'll muster the courage to join together in a revolutionary movement with people of all colors who believe that basic human rights and economic, racial, and gender justice are not unreasonable, pie-in-the-sky goals. After decades of getting played, the sleeping giant just might wake up, stretch its limbs, and tell both parties: Game over. Move aside. It's time to reshuffle this deck.\n\nWhat have the Clintons done to earn such devotion? Did they take extreme political risks to defend the rights of African Americans? Did they courageously stand up to right-wing demagoguery about black communities? Did they help usher in a new era of hope and prosperity for neighborhoods devastated by deindustrialization, globalization, and the disappearance of work? No. Quite the opposite. * * * When Bill Clinton ran for president in 1992, urban black communities across America were suffering from economic collapse. Hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs had vanished as factories moved overseas in search of cheaper labor, a new plantation. Globalization and deindustrialization affected workers of all colors but hit African Americans particularly hard. Unemployment rates among young black men had quadrupled as the rate of industrial employment plummeted. Crime rates spiked in inner-city communities that had been dependent on factory jobs, while hopelessness, despair, and crack addiction swept neighborhoods that had once been solidly working-class. Millions of black folks-many of whom had fled Jim Crow segregation in the South with the hope of obtaining decent work in Northern factories-were suddenly trapped in racially segregated, jobless ghettos.

In practice, however, he capitulated entirely to the right-wing backlash against the civil-rights movement and embraced former president Ronald Reagan's agenda on race, crime, welfare, and taxes-ultimately doing more harm to black communities than Reagan ever did. We should have seen it coming. Back then, Clinton was the standard-bearer for the New Democrats, a group that firmly believed the only way to win back the millions of white voters in the South who had defected to the Republican Party was to adopt the right-wing narrative that black communities ought to be disciplined with harsh punishment rather than coddled with welfare. Reagan had won the presidency by dog-whistling to poor and working-class whites with coded racial appeals: railing against \"welfare queens\" and criminal \"predators\" and condemning \"big government.\" Clinton aimed to win them back, vowing that he would never permit any Republican to be perceived as tougher on crime than he. Just weeks before the critical New Hampshire primary, Clinton proved his toughness by flying back to Arkansas to oversee the execution of Ricky Ray Rector, a mentally impaired black man who had so little conception of what was about to happen to him that he asked for the dessert from his last meal to be saved for him for later. After the execution, Clinton remarked, \"I can be nicked a lot, but no one can say I'm soft on crime.\" As president, Bill Clinton mastered the art of sending mixed cultural messages. Clinton mastered the art of sending mixed cultural messages, appealing to African Americans by belting out \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" in black churches, while at the same time signaling to poor and working-class whites that he was willing to be tougher on black communities than Republicans had been. Clinton was praised for his no-nonsense, pragmatic approach to racial politics. He won the election and appointed a racially diverse cabinet that \"looked like America.\" He won re-election four years later, and the American economy rebounded. Democrats cheered. The Democratic Party had been saved. The Clintons won. Guess who lost? * * * Bill Clinton presided over the largest increase in federal and state prison inmates of any president in American history. Clinton did not declare the War on Crime or the War on Drugs-those wars were declared before Reagan was elected and long before crack hit the streets-but he escalated it beyond what many conservatives had imagined possible. He supported the 100-to-1 sentencing disparity for crack versus powder cocaine, which produced staggering racial injustice in sentencing and boosted funding for drug-law enforcement. Clinton championed the idea of a federal \"three strikes\" law in his 1994 State of the Union address and, months later, signed a $30 billion crime bill that created dozens of new federal capital crimes, mandated life sentences for some three-time offenders, and authorized more than $16 billion for state prison grants and the expansion of police forces. The legislation was hailed by mainstream-media outlets as a victory for the Democrats, who \"were able to wrest the crime issue from the Republicans and make it their own.\" When Clinton left office in 2001, the United States had the highest rate of incarceration in the world. Human Rights Watch reported that in seven states, African Americans constituted 80 to 90 percent of all drug offenders sent to prison, even though they were no more likely than whites to use or sell illegal drugs. Prison admissions for drug offenses reached a level in 2000 for African Americans more than 26 times the level in 1983. All of the presidents since 1980 have contributed to mass incarceration, but as Equal Justice Initiative founder Bryan Stevenson recently observed, \"President Clinton's tenure was the worst.\" Some might argue that it's unfair to judge Hillary Clinton for the policies her husband championed years ago. But Hillary wasn't picking out china while she was first lady. She bravely broke the mold and redefined that job in ways no woman ever had before. She not only campaigned for Bill; she also wielded power and significant influence once he was elected, lobbying for legislation and other measures. That record, and her statements from that era, should be scrutinized. In her support for the 1994 crime bill, for example, she used racially coded rhetoric to cast black children as animals. \"They are not just gangs of kids anymore,\" she said. \"They are often the kinds of kids that are called 'super-predators.' No conscience, no empathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first we have to bring them to heel.\" Both Clintons now express regret over the crime bill, and Hillary says she supports criminal-justice reforms to undo some of the damage that was done by her husband's administration. But on the campaign trail, she continues to invoke the economy and country that Bill Clinton left behind as a legacy she would continue. So what exactly did the Clinton economy look like for black Americans? Taking a hard look at this recent past is about more than just a choice between two candidates. It's about whether the Democratic Party can finally reckon with what its policies have done to African-American communities, and whether it can redeem itself and rightly earn the loyalty of black voters. * * * An oft-repeated myth about the Clinton administration is that although it was overly tough on crime back in the 1990s, at least its policies were good for the economy and for black unemployment rates. The truth is more troubling. As unemployment rates sank to historically low levels for white Americans in the 1990s, the jobless rate among black men in their 20s who didn't have a college degree rose to its highest level ever. This increase in joblessness was propelled by the skyrocketing incarceration rate. Why is this not common knowledge? Because government statistics like poverty and unemployment rates do not include incarcerated people. As Harvard sociologist Bruce Western explains: \"Much of the optimism about declines in racial inequality and the power of the US model of economic growth is misplaced once we account for the invisible poor, behind the walls of America's prisons and jails.\" When Clinton left office in 2001, the true jobless rate for young, non-college-educated black men (including those behind bars) was 42 percent. This figure was never reported. Instead, the media claimed that unemployment rates for African Americans had fallen to record lows, neglecting to mention that this miracle was possible only because incarceration rates were now at record highs. Young black men weren't looking for work at high rates during the Clinton era because they were now behind bars-out of sight, out of mind, and no longer counted in poverty and unemployment statistics. To make matters worse, the federal safety net for poor families was torn to shreds by the Clinton administration in its effort to \"end welfare as we know it.\" In his 1996 State of the Union address, given during his re-election campaign, Clinton declared that \"the era of big government is over\" and immediately sought to prove it by dismantling the federal welfare system known as Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC).

As Harvard sociologist Bruce Western explains: \"Much of the optimism about declines in racial inequality and the power of the US model of economic growth is misplaced once we account for the invisible poor, behind the walls of America's prisons and jails.\" When Clinton left office in 2001, the true jobless rate for young, non-college-educated black men (including those behind bars) was 42 percent. This figure was never reported. Instead, the media claimed that unemployment rates for African Americans had fallen to record lows, neglecting to mention that this miracle was possible only because incarceration rates were now at record highs. Young black men weren't looking for work at high rates during the Clinton era because they were now behind bars-out of sight, out of mind, and no longer counted in poverty and unemployment statistics. To make matters worse, the federal safety net for poor families was torn to shreds by the Clinton administration in its effort to \"end welfare as we know it.\" In his 1996 State of the Union address, given during his re-election campaign, Clinton declared that \"the era of big government is over\" and immediately sought to prove it by dismantling the federal welfare system known as Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC). The welfare-reform legislation that he signed-which Hillary Clinton ardently supported then and characterized as a success as recently as 2008-replaced the federal safety net with a block grant to the states, imposed a five-year lifetime limit on welfare assistance, added work requirements, barred undocumented immigrants from licensed professions, and slashed overall public welfare funding by $54 billion (some was later restored). They are not just gangs of kids anymore...they are 'super-predators.' -Hillary Clinton, speaking in support of the 1994 crime bill Experts and pundits disagree about the true impact of welfare reform, but one thing seems clear: Extreme poverty doubled to 1.5 million in the decade and a half after the law was passed. What is extreme poverty? US households are considered to be in extreme poverty if they are surviving on cash incomes of no more than $2 per person per day in any given month. We tend to think of extreme poverty existing in Third World countries, but here in the United States, shocking numbers of people are struggling to survive on less money per month than many families spend in one evening dining out. Currently, the United States, the richest nation on the planet, has one of the highest child-poverty rates in the developed world. Despite claims that radical changes in crime and welfare policy were driven by a desire to end big government and save taxpayer dollars, the reality is that the Clinton administration didn't reduce the amount of money devoted to the management of the urban poor; it changed what the funds would be used for. Billions of dollars were slashed from public-housing and child-welfare budgets and transferred to the mass-incarceration machine. By 1996, the penal budget was twice the amount that had been allocated to food stamps. During Clinton's tenure, funding for public housing was slashed by $17 billion (a reduction of 61 percent), while funding for corrections was boosted by $19 billion (an increase of 171 percent), according to sociologist Loïc Wacquant \"effectively making the construction of prisons the nation's main housing program for the urban poor.\" Bill Clinton championed discriminatory laws against formerly incarcerated people that have kept millions of Americans locked in a cycle of poverty and desperation. The Clinton administration eliminated Pell grants for prisoners seeking higher education to prepare for their release, supported laws denying federal financial aid to students with drug convictions, and signed legislation imposing a lifetime ban on welfare and food stamps for anyone convicted of a felony drug offense-an exceptionally harsh provision given the racially biased drug war that was raging in inner cities. Perhaps most alarming, Clinton also made it easier for public-housing agencies to deny shelter to anyone with any sort of criminal history (even an arrest without conviction) and championed the \"one strike and you're out\" initiative, which meant that families could be evicted from public housing because one member (or a guest) had committed even a minor offense. People released from prison with no money, no job, and nowhere to go could no longer return home to their loved ones living in federally assisted housing without placing the entire family at risk of eviction. Purging \"the criminal element\" from public housing played well on the evening news, but no provisions were made for people and families as they were forced out on the street. By the end of Clinton's presidency, more than half of working-age African-American men in many large urban areas were saddled with criminal records and subject to legalized discrimination in employment, housing, access to education, and basic public benefits-relegated to a permanent second-class status eerily reminiscent of Jim Crow. It is difficult to overstate the damage that's been done. Generations have been lost to the prison system; countless families have been torn apart or rendered homeless; and a school-to-prison pipeline has been born that shuttles young people from their decrepit, underfunded schools to brand-new high-tech prisons. * * * It didn't have to be like this. As a nation, we had a choice. Rather than spending billions of dollars constructing a vast new penal system, those billions could have been spent putting young people to work in inner-city communities and investing in their schools so they might have some hope of making the transition from an industrial to a service-based economy. Constructive interventions would have been good not only for African Americans trapped in ghettos, but for blue-collar workers of all colors. At the very least, Democrats could have fought to prevent the further destruction of black communities rather than ratcheting up the wars declared on them. Of course, it can be said that it's unfair to criticize the Clintons for punishing black people so harshly, given that many black people were on board with the \"get tough\" movement too. It is absolutely true that black communities back then were in a state of crisis, and that many black activists and politicians were desperate to get violent offenders off the streets. What is often missed, however, is that most of those black activists and politicians weren't asking only for toughness. They were also demanding investment in their schools, better housing, jobs programs for young people, economic-stimulus packages, drug treatment on demand, and better access to healthcare. In the end, they wound up with police and prisons. To say that this was what black people wanted is misleading at best. By 1996, the penal budget was twice the amount that had been allocated to food stamps. To be fair, the Clintons now feel bad about how their politics and policies have worked out for black people. Bill says that he \"overshot the mark\" with his crime policies; and Hillary has put forth a plan to ban racial profiling, eliminate the sentencing disparities between crack and cocaine, and abolish private prisons, among other measures. But what about a larger agenda that would not just reverse some of the policies adopted during the Clinton era, but would rebuild the communities decimated by them? If you listen closely here, you'll notice that Hillary Clinton is still singing the same old tune in a slightly different key. She is arguing that we ought not be seduced by Bernie's rhetoric because we must be \"pragmatic,\" \"face political realities,\" and not get tempted to believe that we can fight for economic justice and win. When politicians start telling you that it is \"unrealistic\" to support candidates who want to build a movement for greater equality, fair wages, universal healthcare, and an end to corporate control of our political system, it's probably best to leave the room. This is not an endorsement for Bernie Sanders, who after all voted for the 1994 crime bill. I also tend to agree with Ta-Nehisi Coates that the way the Sanders campaign handled the question of reparations is one of many signs that Bernie doesn't quite get what's at stake in serious dialogues about racial justice. He was wrong to dismiss reparations as \"divisive,\" as though centuries of slavery, segregation, discrimination, ghettoization, and stigmatization aren't worthy of any specific acknowledgement or remedy. But recognizing that Bernie, like Hillary, has blurred vision when it comes to race is not the same thing as saying their views are equally problematic. Sanders opposed the 1996 welfare-reform law. He also opposed bank deregulation and the Iraq War, both of which Hillary supported, and both of which have proved disastrous. In short, there is such a thing as a lesser evil, and Hillary is not it. The biggest problem with Bernie, in the end, is that he's running as a Democrat-as a member of a political party that not only capitulated to right-wing demagoguery but is now owned and controlled by a relatively small number of millionaires and billionaires. Yes, Sanders has raised millions from small donors, but should he become president, he would also become part of what he has otherwise derided as \"the establishment.\" Even if Bernie's racial-justice views evolve, I hold little hope that a political revolution will occur within the Democratic Party without a sustained outside movement forcing truly transformational change. I am inclined to believe that it would be easier to build a new party than to save the Democratic Party from itself. LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS Email Of course, the idea of building a new political party terrifies most progressives, who understandably fear that it would open the door for a right-wing extremist to get elected. So we play the game of lesser evils. This game has gone on for decades. W.E.B. Du Bois, the eminent scholar and co-founder of the NAACP, shocked many when he refused to play along with this game in the 1956 election, defending his refusal to vote on the grounds that \"there is but one evil party with two names, and it will be elected despite all I do or say.\" While the true losers and winners of this game are highly predictable, the game of lesser evils makes for great entertainment and can now be viewed 24 hours a day on cable-news networks. Hillary believes that she can win this game in 2016 because this time she's got us, the black vote, in her back pocket-her lucky card. She may be surprised to discover that the younger generation no longer wants to play her game. Or maybe not. Maybe we'll all continue to play along and pretend that we don't know how it will turn out in the end. Hopefully, one day, we'll muster the courage to join together in a revolutionary movement with people of all colors who believe that basic human rights and economic, racial, and gender justice are not unreasonable, pie-in-the-sky goals. After decades of getting played, the sleeping giant just might wake up, stretch its limbs, and tell both parties: Game over. Move aside. It's time to reshuffle this deck.\n\n* * * When Bill Clinton ran for president in 1992, urban black communities across America were suffering from economic collapse. Hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs had vanished as factories moved overseas in search of cheaper labor, a new plantation. Globalization and deindustrialization affected workers of all colors but hit African Americans particularly hard. Unemployment rates among young black men had quadrupled as the rate of industrial employment plummeted. Crime rates spiked in inner-city communities that had been dependent on factory jobs, while hopelessness, despair, and crack addiction swept neighborhoods that had once been solidly working-class. Millions of black folks-many of whom had fled Jim Crow segregation in the South with the hope of obtaining decent work in Northern factories-were suddenly trapped in racially segregated, jobless ghettos.

In practice, however, he capitulated entirely to the right-wing backlash against the civil-rights movement and embraced former president Ronald Reagan's agenda on race, crime, welfare, and taxes-ultimately doing more harm to black communities than Reagan ever did. We should have seen it coming. Back then, Clinton was the standard-bearer for the New Democrats, a group that firmly believed the only way to win back the millions of white voters in the South who had defected to the Republican Party was to adopt the right-wing narrative that black communities ought to be disciplined with harsh punishment rather than coddled with welfare. Reagan had won the presidency by dog-whistling to poor and working-class whites with coded racial appeals: railing against \"welfare queens\" and criminal \"predators\" and condemning \"big government.\" Clinton aimed to win them back, vowing that he would never permit any Republican to be perceived as tougher on crime than he. Just weeks before the critical New Hampshire primary, Clinton proved his toughness by flying back to Arkansas to oversee the execution of Ricky Ray Rector, a mentally impaired black man who had so little conception of what was about to happen to him that he asked for the dessert from his last meal to be saved for him for later. After the execution, Clinton remarked, \"I can be nicked a lot, but no one can say I'm soft on crime.\" As president, Bill Clinton mastered the art of sending mixed cultural messages. Clinton mastered the art of sending mixed cultural messages, appealing to African Americans by belting out \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" in black churches, while at the same time signaling to poor and working-class whites that he was willing to be tougher on black communities than Republicans had been. Clinton was praised for his no-nonsense, pragmatic approach to racial politics. He won the election and appointed a racially diverse cabinet that \"looked like America.\" He won re-election four years later, and the American economy rebounded. Democrats cheered. The Democratic Party had been saved. The Clintons won. Guess who lost? * * * Bill Clinton presided over the largest increase in federal and state prison inmates of any president in American history. Clinton did not declare the War on Crime or the War on Drugs-those wars were declared before Reagan was elected and long before crack hit the streets-but he escalated it beyond what many conservatives had imagined possible. He supported the 100-to-1 sentencing disparity for crack versus powder cocaine, which produced staggering racial injustice in sentencing and boosted funding for drug-law enforcement. Clinton championed the idea of a federal \"three strikes\" law in his 1994 State of the Union address and, months later, signed a $30 billion crime bill that created dozens of new federal capital crimes, mandated life sentences for some three-time offenders, and authorized more than $16 billion for state prison grants and the expansion of police forces. The legislation was hailed by mainstream-media outlets as a victory for the Democrats, who \"were able to wrest the crime issue from the Republicans and make it their own.\" When Clinton left office in 2001, the United States had the highest rate of incarceration in the world. Human Rights Watch reported that in seven states, African Americans constituted 80 to 90 percent of all drug offenders sent to prison, even though they were no more likely than whites to use or sell illegal drugs. Prison admissions for drug offenses reached a level in 2000 for African Americans more than 26 times the level in 1983. All of the presidents since 1980 have contributed to mass incarceration, but as Equal Justice Initiative founder Bryan Stevenson recently observed, \"President Clinton's tenure was the worst.\" Some might argue that it's unfair to judge Hillary Clinton for the policies her husband championed years ago. But Hillary wasn't picking out china while she was first lady. She bravely broke the mold and redefined that job in ways no woman ever had before. She not only campaigned for Bill; she also wielded power and significant influence once he was elected, lobbying for legislation and other measures. That record, and her statements from that era, should be scrutinized. In her support for the 1994 crime bill, for example, she used racially coded rhetoric to cast black children as animals. \"They are not just gangs of kids anymore,\" she said. \"They are often the kinds of kids that are called 'super-predators.' No conscience, no empathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first we have to bring them to heel.\" Both Clintons now express regret over the crime bill, and Hillary says she supports criminal-justice reforms to undo some of the damage that was done by her husband's administration. But on the campaign trail, she continues to invoke the economy and country that Bill Clinton left behind as a legacy she would continue. So what exactly did the Clinton economy look like for black Americans? Taking a hard look at this recent past is about more than just a choice between two candidates. It's about whether the Democratic Party can finally reckon with what its policies have done to African-American communities, and whether it can redeem itself and rightly earn the loyalty of black voters. * * * An oft-repeated myth about the Clinton administration is that although it was overly tough on crime back in the 1990s, at least its policies were good for the economy and for black unemployment rates. The truth is more troubling. As unemployment rates sank to historically low levels for white Americans in the 1990s, the jobless rate among black men in their 20s who didn't have a college degree rose to its highest level ever. This increase in joblessness was propelled by the skyrocketing incarceration rate. Why is this not common knowledge? Because government statistics like poverty and unemployment rates do not include incarcerated people. As Harvard sociologist Bruce Western explains: \"Much of the optimism about declines in racial inequality and the power of the US model of economic growth is misplaced once we account for the invisible poor, behind the walls of America's prisons and jails.\" When Clinton left office in 2001, the true jobless rate for young, non-college-educated black men (including those behind bars) was 42 percent.

As unemployment rates sank to historically low levels for white Americans in the 1990s, the jobless rate among black men in their 20s who didn't have a college degree rose to its highest level ever. This increase in joblessness was propelled by the skyrocketing incarceration rate. Why is this not common knowledge? Because government statistics like poverty and unemployment rates do not include incarcerated people. As Harvard sociologist Bruce Western explains: \"Much of the optimism about declines in racial inequality and the power of the US model of economic growth is misplaced once we account for the invisible poor, behind the walls of America's prisons and jails.\" When Clinton left office in 2001, the true jobless rate for young, non-college-educated black men (including those behind bars) was 42 percent. This figure was never reported. Instead, the media claimed that unemployment rates for African Americans had fallen to record lows, neglecting to mention that this miracle was possible only because incarceration rates were now at record highs. Young black men weren't looking for work at high rates during the Clinton era because they were now behind bars-out of sight, out of mind, and no longer counted in poverty and unemployment statistics. To make matters worse, the federal safety net for poor families was torn to shreds by the Clinton administration in its effort to \"end welfare as we know it.\" In his 1996 State of the Union address, given during his re-election campaign, Clinton declared that \"the era of big government is over\" and immediately sought to prove it by dismantling the federal welfare system known as Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC). The welfare-reform legislation that he signed-which Hillary Clinton ardently supported then and characterized as a success as recently as 2008-replaced the federal safety net with a block grant to the states, imposed a five-year lifetime limit on welfare assistance, added work requirements, barred undocumented immigrants from licensed professions, and slashed overall public welfare funding by $54 billion (some was later restored). They are not just gangs of kids anymore...they are 'super-predators.' -Hillary Clinton, speaking in support of the 1994 crime bill Experts and pundits disagree about the true impact of welfare reform, but one thing seems clear: Extreme poverty doubled to 1.5 million in the decade and a half after the law was passed. What is extreme poverty? US households are considered to be in extreme poverty if they are surviving on cash incomes of no more than $2 per person per day in any given month. We tend to think of extreme poverty existing in Third World countries, but here in the United States, shocking numbers of people are struggling to survive on less money per month than many families spend in one evening dining out. Currently, the United States, the richest nation on the planet, has one of the highest child-poverty rates in the developed world. Despite claims that radical changes in crime and welfare policy were driven by a desire to end big government and save taxpayer dollars, the reality is that the Clinton administration didn't reduce the amount of money devoted to the management of the urban poor; it changed what the funds would be used for. Billions of dollars were slashed from public-housing and child-welfare budgets and transferred to the mass-incarceration machine. By 1996, the penal budget was twice the amount that had been allocated to food stamps. During Clinton's tenure, funding for public housing was slashed by $17 billion (a reduction of 61 percent), while funding for corrections was boosted by $19 billion (an increase of 171 percent), according to sociologist Loïc Wacquant \"effectively making the construction of prisons the nation's main housing program for the urban poor.\" Bill Clinton championed discriminatory laws against formerly incarcerated people that have kept millions of Americans locked in a cycle of poverty and desperation. The Clinton administration eliminated Pell grants for prisoners seeking higher education to prepare for their release, supported laws denying federal financial aid to students with drug convictions, and signed legislation imposing a lifetime ban on welfare and food stamps for anyone convicted of a felony drug offense-an exceptionally harsh provision given the racially biased drug war that was raging in inner cities. Perhaps most alarming, Clinton also made it easier for public-housing agencies to deny shelter to anyone with any sort of criminal history (even an arrest without conviction) and championed the \"one strike and you're out\" initiative, which meant that families could be evicted from public housing because one member (or a guest) had committed even a minor offense. People released from prison with no money, no job, and nowhere to go could no longer return home to their loved ones living in federally assisted housing without placing the entire family at risk of eviction. Purging \"the criminal element\" from public housing played well on the evening news, but no provisions were made for people and families as they were forced out on the street. By the end of Clinton's presidency, more than half of working-age African-American men in many large urban areas were saddled with criminal records and subject to legalized discrimination in employment, housing, access to education, and basic public benefits-relegated to a permanent second-class status eerily reminiscent of Jim Crow. It is difficult to overstate the damage that's been done. Generations have been lost to the prison system; countless families have been torn apart or rendered homeless; and a school-to-prison pipeline has been born that shuttles young people from their decrepit, underfunded schools to brand-new high-tech prisons. * * * It didn't have to be like this. As a nation, we had a choice. Rather than spending billions of dollars constructing a vast new penal system, those billions could have been spent putting young people to work in inner-city communities and investing in their schools so they might have some hope of making the transition from an industrial to a service-based economy. Constructive interventions would have been good not only for African Americans trapped in ghettos, but for blue-collar workers of all colors. At the very least, Democrats could have fought to prevent the further destruction of black communities rather than ratcheting up the wars declared on them. Of course, it can be said that it's unfair to criticize the Clintons for punishing black people so harshly, given that many black people were on board with the \"get tough\" movement too. It is absolutely true that black communities back then were in a state of crisis, and that many black activists and politicians were desperate to get violent offenders off the streets. What is often missed, however, is that most of those black activists and politicians weren't asking only for toughness. They were also demanding investment in their schools, better housing, jobs programs for young people, economic-stimulus packages, drug treatment on demand, and better access to healthcare. In the end, they wound up with police and prisons. To say that this was what black people wanted is misleading at best. By 1996, the penal budget was twice the amount that had been allocated to food stamps. To be fair, the Clintons now feel bad about how their politics and policies have worked out for black people. Bill says that he \"overshot the mark\" with his crime policies; and Hillary has put forth a plan to ban racial profiling, eliminate the sentencing disparities between crack and cocaine, and abolish private prisons, among other measures. But what about a larger agenda that would not just reverse some of the policies adopted during the Clinton era, but would rebuild the communities decimated by them? If you listen closely here, you'll notice that Hillary Clinton is still singing the same old tune in a slightly different key. She is arguing that we ought not be seduced by Bernie's rhetoric because we must be \"pragmatic,\" \"face political realities,\" and not get tempted to believe that we can fight for economic justice and win. When politicians start telling you that it is \"unrealistic\" to support candidates who want to build a movement for greater equality, fair wages, universal healthcare, and an end to corporate control of our political system, it's probably best to leave the room. This is not an endorsement for Bernie Sanders, who after all voted for the 1994 crime bill. I also tend to agree with Ta-Nehisi Coates that the way the Sanders campaign handled the question of reparations is one of many signs that Bernie doesn't quite get what's at stake in serious dialogues about racial justice. He was wrong to dismiss reparations as \"divisive,\" as though centuries of slavery, segregation, discrimination, ghettoization, and stigmatization aren't worthy of any specific acknowledgement or remedy. But recognizing that Bernie, like Hillary, has blurred vision when it comes to race is not the same thing as saying their views are equally problematic. Sanders opposed the 1996 welfare-reform law. He also opposed bank deregulation and the Iraq War, both of which Hillary supported, and both of which have proved disastrous. In short, there is such a thing as a lesser evil, and Hillary is not it. The biggest problem with Bernie, in the end, is that he's running as a Democrat-as a member of a political party that not only capitulated to right-wing demagoguery but is now owned and controlled by a relatively small number of millionaires and billionaires. Yes, Sanders has raised millions from small donors, but should he become president, he would also become part of what he has otherwise derided as \"the establishment.\" Even if Bernie's racial-justice views evolve, I hold little hope that a political revolution will occur within the Democratic Party without a sustained outside movement forcing truly transformational change. I am inclined to believe that it would be easier to build a new party than to save the Democratic Party from itself. LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS Email Of course, the idea of building a new political party terrifies most progressives, who understandably fear that it would open the door for a right-wing extremist to get elected. So we play the game of lesser evils. This game has gone on for decades. W.E.B. Du Bois, the eminent scholar and co-founder of the NAACP, shocked many when he refused to play along with this game in the 1956 election, defending his refusal to vote on the grounds that \"there is but one evil party with two names, and it will be elected despite all I do or say.\" While the true losers and winners of this game are highly predictable, the game of lesser evils makes for great entertainment and can now be viewed 24 hours a day on cable-news networks. Hillary believes that she can win this game in 2016 because this time she's got us, the black vote, in her back pocket-her lucky card. She may be surprised to discover that the younger generation no longer wants to play her game. Or maybe not. Maybe we'll all continue to play along and pretend that we don't know how it will turn out in the end. Hopefully, one day, we'll muster the courage to join together in a revolutionary movement with people of all colors who believe that basic human rights and economic, racial, and gender justice are not unreasonable, pie-in-the-sky goals. After decades of getting played, the sleeping giant just might wake up, stretch its limbs, and tell both parties: Game over. Move aside. It's time to reshuffle this deck.\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nFeature / James North\n\nElie Mystal\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nFeature / James North\n\nElie Mystal\n\nElie Mystal\n\nOn the campaign trail, Bill Clinton made the economy his top priority and argued persuasively that conservatives were using race to divide the nation and divert attention from the failed economy. In practice, however, he capitulated entirely to the right-wing backlash against the civil-rights movement and embraced former president Ronald Reagan's agenda on race, crime, welfare, and taxes-ultimately doing more harm to black communities than Reagan ever did. We should have seen it coming. Back then, Clinton was the standard-bearer for the New Democrats, a group that firmly believed the only way to win back the millions of white voters in the South who had defected to the Republican Party was to adopt the right-wing narrative that black communities ought to be disciplined with harsh punishment rather than coddled with welfare. Reagan had won the presidency by dog-whistling to poor and working-class whites with coded racial appeals: railing against \"welfare queens\" and criminal \"predators\" and condemning \"big government.\" Clinton aimed to win them back, vowing that he would never permit any Republican to be perceived as tougher on crime than he. Just weeks before the critical New Hampshire primary, Clinton proved his toughness by flying back to Arkansas to oversee the execution of Ricky Ray Rector, a mentally impaired black man who had so little conception of what was about to happen to him that he asked for the dessert from his last meal to be saved for him for later. After the execution, Clinton remarked, \"I can be nicked a lot, but no one can say I'm soft on crime.\" As president, Bill Clinton mastered the art of sending mixed cultural messages. Clinton mastered the art of sending mixed cultural messages, appealing to African Americans by belting out \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" in black churches, while at the same time signaling to poor and working-class whites that he was willing to be tougher on black communities than Republicans had been. Clinton was praised for his no-nonsense, pragmatic approach to racial politics. He won the election and appointed a racially diverse cabinet that \"looked like America.\" He won re-election four years later, and the American economy rebounded. Democrats cheered. The Democratic Party had been saved. The Clintons won. Guess who lost? * * * Bill Clinton presided over the largest increase in federal and state prison inmates of any president in American history. Clinton did not declare the War on Crime or the War on Drugs-those wars were declared before Reagan was elected and long before crack hit the streets-but he escalated it beyond what many conservatives had imagined possible. He supported the 100-to-1 sentencing disparity for crack versus powder cocaine, which produced staggering racial injustice in sentencing and boosted funding for drug-law enforcement. Clinton championed the idea of a federal \"three strikes\" law in his 1994 State of the Union address and, months later, signed a $30 billion crime bill that created dozens of new federal capital crimes, mandated life sentences for some three-time offenders, and authorized more than $16 billion for state prison grants and the expansion of police forces. The legislation was hailed by mainstream-media outlets as a victory for the Democrats, who \"were able to wrest the crime issue from the Republicans and make it their own.\" When Clinton left office in 2001, the United States had the highest rate of incarceration in the world. Human Rights Watch reported that in seven states, African Americans constituted 80 to 90 percent of all drug offenders sent to prison, even though they were no more likely than whites to use or sell illegal drugs. Prison admissions for drug offenses reached a level in 2000 for African Americans more than 26 times the level in 1983. All of the presidents since 1980 have contributed to mass incarceration, but as Equal Justice Initiative founder Bryan Stevenson recently observed, \"President Clinton's tenure was the worst.\" Some might argue that it's unfair to judge Hillary Clinton for the policies her husband championed years ago. But Hillary wasn't picking out china while she was first lady. She bravely broke the mold and redefined that job in ways no woman ever had before. She not only campaigned for Bill; she also wielded power and significant influence once he was elected, lobbying for legislation and other measures. That record, and her statements from that era, should be scrutinized. In her support for the 1994 crime bill, for example, she used racially coded rhetoric to cast black children as animals. \"They are not just gangs of kids anymore,\" she said. \"They are often the kinds of kids that are called 'super-predators.' No conscience, no empathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first we have to bring them to heel.\" Both Clintons now express regret over the crime bill, and Hillary says she supports criminal-justice reforms to undo some of the damage that was done by her husband's administration. But on the campaign trail, she continues to invoke the economy and country that Bill Clinton left behind as a legacy she would continue. So what exactly did the Clinton economy look like for black Americans? Taking a hard look at this recent past is about more than just a choice between two candidates. It's about whether the Democratic Party can finally reckon with what its policies have done to African-American communities, and whether it can redeem itself and rightly earn the loyalty of black voters. * * * An oft-repeated myth about the Clinton administration is that although it was overly tough on crime back in the 1990s, at least its policies were good for the economy and for black unemployment rates.

Billions of dollars were slashed from public-housing and child-welfare budgets and transferred to the mass-incarceration machine. By 1996, the penal budget was twice the amount that had been allocated to food stamps. During Clinton's tenure, funding for public housing was slashed by $17 billion (a reduction of 61 percent), while funding for corrections was boosted by $19 billion (an increase of 171 percent), according to sociologist Loïc Wacquant \"effectively making the construction of prisons the nation's main housing program for the urban poor.\" Bill Clinton championed discriminatory laws against formerly incarcerated people that have kept millions of Americans locked in a cycle of poverty and desperation. The Clinton administration eliminated Pell grants for prisoners seeking higher education to prepare for their release, supported laws denying federal financial aid to students with drug convictions, and signed legislation imposing a lifetime ban on welfare and food stamps for anyone convicted of a felony drug offense-an exceptionally harsh provision given the racially biased drug war that was raging in inner cities. Perhaps most alarming, Clinton also made it easier for public-housing agencies to deny shelter to anyone with any sort of criminal history (even an arrest without conviction) and championed the \"one strike and you're out\" initiative, which meant that families could be evicted from public housing because one member (or a guest) had committed even a minor offense. People released from prison with no money, no job, and nowhere to go could no longer return home to their loved ones living in federally assisted housing without placing the entire family at risk of eviction. Purging \"the criminal element\" from public housing played well on the evening news, but no provisions were made for people and families as they were forced out on the street. By the end of Clinton's presidency, more than half of working-age African-American men in many large urban areas were saddled with criminal records and subject to legalized discrimination in employment, housing, access to education, and basic public benefits-relegated to a permanent second-class status eerily reminiscent of Jim Crow. It is difficult to overstate the damage that's been done. Generations have been lost to the prison system; countless families have been torn apart or rendered homeless; and a school-to-prison pipeline has been born that shuttles young people from their decrepit, underfunded schools to brand-new high-tech prisons. * * * It didn't have to be like this. As a nation, we had a choice. Rather than spending billions of dollars constructing a vast new penal system, those billions could have been spent putting young people to work in inner-city communities and investing in their schools so they might have some hope of making the transition from an industrial to a service-based economy. Constructive interventions would have been good not only for African Americans trapped in ghettos, but for blue-collar workers of all colors. At the very least, Democrats could have fought to prevent the further destruction of black communities rather than ratcheting up the wars declared on them. Of course, it can be said that it's unfair to criticize the Clintons for punishing black people so harshly, given that many black people were on board with the \"get tough\" movement too. It is absolutely true that black communities back then were in a state of crisis, and that many black activists and politicians were desperate to get violent offenders off the streets. What is often missed, however, is that most of those black activists and politicians weren't asking only for toughness. They were also demanding investment in their schools, better housing, jobs programs for young people, economic-stimulus packages, drug treatment on demand, and better access to healthcare. In the end, they wound up with police and prisons. To say that this was what black people wanted is misleading at best. By 1996, the penal budget was twice the amount that had been allocated to food stamps. To be fair, the Clintons now feel bad about how their politics and policies have worked out for black people. Bill says that he \"overshot the mark\" with his crime policies; and Hillary has put forth a plan to ban racial profiling, eliminate the sentencing disparities between crack and cocaine, and abolish private prisons, among other measures. But what about a larger agenda that would not just reverse some of the policies adopted during the Clinton era, but would rebuild the communities decimated by them? If you listen closely here, you'll notice that Hillary Clinton is still singing the same old tune in a slightly different key. She is arguing that we ought not be seduced by Bernie's rhetoric because we must be \"pragmatic,\" \"face political realities,\" and not get tempted to believe that we can fight for economic justice and win. When politicians start telling you that it is \"unrealistic\" to support candidates who want to build a movement for greater equality, fair wages, universal healthcare, and an end to corporate control of our political system, it's probably best to leave the room. This is not an endorsement for Bernie Sanders, who after all voted for the 1994 crime bill. I also tend to agree with Ta-Nehisi Coates that the way the Sanders campaign handled the question of reparations is one of many signs that Bernie doesn't quite get what's at stake in serious dialogues about racial justice. He was wrong to dismiss reparations as \"divisive,\" as though centuries of slavery, segregation, discrimination, ghettoization, and stigmatization aren't worthy of any specific acknowledgement or remedy. But recognizing that Bernie, like Hillary, has blurred vision when it comes to race is not the same thing as saying their views are equally problematic. Sanders opposed the 1996 welfare-reform law. He also opposed bank deregulation and the Iraq War, both of which Hillary supported, and both of which have proved disastrous. In short, there is such a thing as a lesser evil, and Hillary is not it. The biggest problem with Bernie, in the end, is that he's running as a Democrat-as a member of a political party that not only capitulated to right-wing demagoguery but is now owned and controlled by a relatively small number of millionaires and billionaires. Yes, Sanders has raised millions from small donors, but should he become president, he would also become part of what he has otherwise derided as \"the establishment.\" Even if Bernie's racial-justice views evolve, I hold little hope that a political revolution will occur within the Democratic Party without a sustained outside movement forcing truly transformational change. I am inclined to believe that it would be easier to build a new party than to save the Democratic Party from itself. LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS Email Of course, the idea of building a new political party terrifies most progressives, who understandably fear that it would open the door for a right-wing extremist to get elected. So we play the game of lesser evils. This game has gone on for decades. W.E.B. Du Bois, the eminent scholar and co-founder of the NAACP, shocked many when he refused to play along with this game in the 1956 election, defending his refusal to vote on the grounds that \"there is but one evil party with two names, and it will be elected despite all I do or say.\" While the true losers and winners of this game are highly predictable, the game of lesser evils makes for great entertainment and can now be viewed 24 hours a day on cable-news networks. Hillary believes that she can win this game in 2016 because this time she's got us, the black vote, in her back pocket-her lucky card. She may be surprised to discover that the younger generation no longer wants to play her game. Or maybe not. Maybe we'll all continue to play along and pretend that we don't know how it will turn out in the end. Hopefully, one day, we'll muster the courage to join together in a revolutionary movement with people of all colors who believe that basic human rights and economic, racial, and gender justice are not unreasonable, pie-in-the-sky goals. After decades of getting played, the sleeping giant just might wake up, stretch its limbs, and tell both parties: Game over. Move aside. It's time to reshuffle this deck.\n\nJust weeks before the critical New Hampshire primary, Clinton proved his toughness by flying back to Arkansas to oversee the execution of Ricky Ray Rector, a mentally impaired black man who had so little conception of what was about to happen to him that he asked for the dessert from his last meal to be saved for him for later. After the execution, Clinton remarked, \"I can be nicked a lot, but no one can say I'm soft on crime.\" As president, Bill Clinton mastered the art of sending mixed cultural messages. Clinton mastered the art of sending mixed cultural messages, appealing to African Americans by belting out \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" in black churches, while at the same time signaling to poor and working-class whites that he was willing to be tougher on black communities than Republicans had been. Clinton was praised for his no-nonsense, pragmatic approach to racial politics. He won the election and appointed a racially diverse cabinet that \"looked like America.\" He won re-election four years later, and the American economy rebounded. Democrats cheered. The Democratic Party had been saved. The Clintons won. Guess who lost? * * * Bill Clinton presided over the largest increase in federal and state prison inmates of any president in American history. Clinton did not declare the War on Crime or the War on Drugs-those wars were declared before Reagan was elected and long before crack hit the streets-but he escalated it beyond what many conservatives had imagined possible. He supported the 100-to-1 sentencing disparity for crack versus powder cocaine, which produced staggering racial injustice in sentencing and boosted funding for drug-law enforcement. Clinton championed the idea of a federal \"three strikes\" law in his 1994 State of the Union address and, months later, signed a $30 billion crime bill that created dozens of new federal capital crimes, mandated life sentences for some three-time offenders, and authorized more than $16 billion for state prison grants and the expansion of police forces. The legislation was hailed by mainstream-media outlets as a victory for the Democrats, who \"were able to wrest the crime issue from the Republicans and make it their own.\" When Clinton left office in 2001, the United States had the highest rate of incarceration in the world. Human Rights Watch reported that in seven states, African Americans constituted 80 to 90 percent of all drug offenders sent to prison, even though they were no more likely than whites to use or sell illegal drugs. Prison admissions for drug offenses reached a level in 2000 for African Americans more than 26 times the level in 1983. All of the presidents since 1980 have contributed to mass incarceration, but as Equal Justice Initiative founder Bryan Stevenson recently observed, \"President Clinton's tenure was the worst.\" Some might argue that it's unfair to judge Hillary Clinton for the policies her husband championed years ago. But Hillary wasn't picking out china while she was first lady. She bravely broke the mold and redefined that job in ways no woman ever had before. She not only campaigned for Bill; she also wielded power and significant influence once he was elected, lobbying for legislation and other measures. That record, and her statements from that era, should be scrutinized. In her support for the 1994 crime bill, for example, she used racially coded rhetoric to cast black children as animals. \"They are not just gangs of kids anymore,\" she said. \"They are often the kinds of kids that are called 'super-predators.' No conscience, no empathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first we have to bring them to heel.\" Both Clintons now express regret over the crime bill, and Hillary says she supports criminal-justice reforms to undo some of the damage that was done by her husband's administration. But on the campaign trail, she continues to invoke the economy and country that Bill Clinton left behind as a legacy she would continue. So what exactly did the Clinton economy look like for black Americans? Taking a hard look at this recent past is about more than just a choice between two candidates. It's about whether the Democratic Party can finally reckon with what its policies have done to African-American communities, and whether it can redeem itself and rightly earn the loyalty of black voters. * * * An oft-repeated myth about the Clinton administration is that although it was overly tough on crime back in the 1990s, at least its policies were good for the economy and for black unemployment rates. The truth is more troubling. As unemployment rates sank to historically low levels for white Americans in the 1990s, the jobless rate among black men in their 20s who didn't have a college degree rose to its highest level ever. This increase in joblessness was propelled by the skyrocketing incarceration rate. Why is this not common knowledge? Because government statistics like poverty and unemployment rates do not include incarcerated people. As Harvard sociologist Bruce Western explains: \"Much of the optimism about declines in racial inequality and the power of the US model of economic growth is misplaced once we account for the invisible poor, behind the walls of America's prisons and jails.\" When Clinton left office in 2001, the true jobless rate for young, non-college-educated black men (including those behind bars) was 42 percent. This figure was never reported. Instead, the media claimed that unemployment rates for African Americans had fallen to record lows, neglecting to mention that this miracle was possible only because incarceration rates were now at record highs. Young black men weren't looking for work at high rates during the Clinton era because they were now behind bars-out of sight, out of mind, and no longer counted in poverty and unemployment statistics. To make matters worse, the federal safety net for poor families was torn to shreds by the Clinton administration in its effort to \"end welfare as we know it.\" In his 1996 State of the Union address, given during his re-election campaign, Clinton declared that \"the era of big government is over\" and immediately sought to prove it by dismantling the federal welfare system known as Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC). The welfare-reform legislation that he signed-which Hillary Clinton ardently supported then and characterized as a success as recently as 2008-replaced the federal safety net with a block grant to the states, imposed a five-year lifetime limit on welfare assistance, added work requirements, barred undocumented immigrants from licensed professions, and slashed overall public welfare funding by $54 billion (some was later restored). They are not just gangs of kids anymore...they are 'super-predators.' -Hillary Clinton, speaking in support of the 1994 crime bill Experts and pundits disagree about the true impact of welfare reform, but one thing seems clear: Extreme poverty doubled to 1.5 million in the decade and a half after the law was passed. What is extreme poverty? US households are considered to be in extreme poverty if they are surviving on cash incomes of no more than $2 per person per day in any given month. We tend to think of extreme poverty existing in Third World countries, but here in the United States, shocking numbers of people are struggling to survive on less money per month than many families spend in one evening dining out. Currently, the United States, the richest nation on the planet, has one of the highest child-poverty rates in the developed world. Despite claims that radical changes in crime and welfare policy were driven by a desire to end big government and save taxpayer dollars, the reality is that the Clinton administration didn't reduce the amount of money devoted to the management of the urban poor; it changed what the funds would be used for.

It's time to reshuffle this deck.\n\nClinton was praised for his no-nonsense, pragmatic approach to racial politics. He won the election and appointed a racially diverse cabinet that \"looked like America.\" He won re-election four years later, and the American economy rebounded. Democrats cheered. The Democratic Party had been saved. The Clintons won. Guess who lost? * * * Bill Clinton presided over the largest increase in federal and state prison inmates of any president in American history. Clinton did not declare the War on Crime or the War on Drugs-those wars were declared before Reagan was elected and long before crack hit the streets-but he escalated it beyond what many conservatives had imagined possible. He supported the 100-to-1 sentencing disparity for crack versus powder cocaine, which produced staggering racial injustice in sentencing and boosted funding for drug-law enforcement. Clinton championed the idea of a federal \"three strikes\" law in his 1994 State of the Union address and, months later, signed a $30 billion crime bill that created dozens of new federal capital crimes, mandated life sentences for some three-time offenders, and authorized more than $16 billion for state prison grants and the expansion of police forces. The legislation was hailed by mainstream-media outlets as a victory for the Democrats, who \"were able to wrest the crime issue from the Republicans and make it their own.\" When Clinton left office in 2001, the United States had the highest rate of incarceration in the world. Human Rights Watch reported that in seven states, African Americans constituted 80 to 90 percent of all drug offenders sent to prison, even though they were no more likely than whites to use or sell illegal drugs. Prison admissions for drug offenses reached a level in 2000 for African Americans more than 26 times the level in 1983. All of the presidents since 1980 have contributed to mass incarceration, but as Equal Justice Initiative founder Bryan Stevenson recently observed, \"President Clinton's tenure was the worst.\" Some might argue that it's unfair to judge Hillary Clinton for the policies her husband championed years ago. But Hillary wasn't picking out china while she was first lady. She bravely broke the mold and redefined that job in ways no woman ever had before. She not only campaigned for Bill; she also wielded power and significant influence once he was elected, lobbying for legislation and other measures. That record, and her statements from that era, should be scrutinized. In her support for the 1994 crime bill, for example, she used racially coded rhetoric to cast black children as animals. \"They are not just gangs of kids anymore,\" she said. \"They are often the kinds of kids that are called 'super-predators.' No conscience, no empathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first we have to bring them to heel.\" Both Clintons now express regret over the crime bill, and Hillary says she supports criminal-justice reforms to undo some of the damage that was done by her husband's administration. But on the campaign trail, she continues to invoke the economy and country that Bill Clinton left behind as a legacy she would continue. So what exactly did the Clinton economy look like for black Americans? Taking a hard look at this recent past is about more than just a choice between two candidates. It's about whether the Democratic Party can finally reckon with what its policies have done to African-American communities, and whether it can redeem itself and rightly earn the loyalty of black voters. * * * An oft-repeated myth about the Clinton administration is that although it was overly tough on crime back in the 1990s, at least its policies were good for the economy and for black unemployment rates. The truth is more troubling. As unemployment rates sank to historically low levels for white Americans in the 1990s, the jobless rate among black men in their 20s who didn't have a college degree rose to its highest level ever. This increase in joblessness was propelled by the skyrocketing incarceration rate. Why is this not common knowledge? Because government statistics like poverty and unemployment rates do not include incarcerated people. As Harvard sociologist Bruce Western explains: \"Much of the optimism about declines in racial inequality and the power of the US model of economic growth is misplaced once we account for the invisible poor, behind the walls of America's prisons and jails.\" When Clinton left office in 2001, the true jobless rate for young, non-college-educated black men (including those behind bars) was 42 percent. This figure was never reported. Instead, the media claimed that unemployment rates for African Americans had fallen to record lows, neglecting to mention that this miracle was possible only because incarceration rates were now at record highs. Young black men weren't looking for work at high rates during the Clinton era because they were now behind bars-out of sight, out of mind, and no longer counted in poverty and unemployment statistics. To make matters worse, the federal safety net for poor families was torn to shreds by the Clinton administration in its effort to \"end welfare as we know it.\" In his 1996 State of the Union address, given during his re-election campaign, Clinton declared that \"the era of big government is over\" and immediately sought to prove it by dismantling the federal welfare system known as Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC). The welfare-reform legislation that he signed-which Hillary Clinton ardently supported then and characterized as a success as recently as 2008-replaced the federal safety net with a block grant to the states, imposed a five-year lifetime limit on welfare assistance, added work requirements, barred undocumented immigrants from licensed professions, and slashed overall public welfare funding by $54 billion (some was later restored). They are not just gangs of kids anymore...they are 'super-predators.' -Hillary Clinton, speaking in support of the 1994 crime bill Experts and pundits disagree about the true impact of welfare reform, but one thing seems clear: Extreme poverty doubled to 1.5 million in the decade and a half after the law was passed. What is extreme poverty? US households are considered to be in extreme poverty if they are surviving on cash incomes of no more than $2 per person per day in any given month. We tend to think of extreme poverty existing in Third World countries, but here in the United States, shocking numbers of people are struggling to survive on less money per month than many families spend in one evening dining out. Currently, the United States, the richest nation on the planet, has one of the highest child-poverty rates in the developed world. Despite claims that radical changes in crime and welfare policy were driven by a desire to end big government and save taxpayer dollars, the reality is that the Clinton administration didn't reduce the amount of money devoted to the management of the urban poor; it changed what the funds would be used for. Billions of dollars were slashed from public-housing and child-welfare budgets and transferred to the mass-incarceration machine. By 1996, the penal budget was twice the amount that had been allocated to food stamps. During Clinton's tenure, funding for public housing was slashed by $17 billion (a reduction of 61 percent), while funding for corrections was boosted by $19 billion (an increase of 171 percent), according to sociologist Loïc Wacquant \"effectively making the construction of prisons the nation's main housing program for the urban poor.\" Bill Clinton championed discriminatory laws against formerly incarcerated people that have kept millions of Americans locked in a cycle of poverty and desperation. The Clinton administration eliminated Pell grants for prisoners seeking higher education to prepare for their release, supported laws denying federal financial aid to students with drug convictions, and signed legislation imposing a lifetime ban on welfare and food stamps for anyone convicted of a felony drug offense-an exceptionally harsh provision given the racially biased drug war that was raging in inner cities. Perhaps most alarming, Clinton also made it easier for public-housing agencies to deny shelter to anyone with any sort of criminal history (even an arrest without conviction) and championed the \"one strike and you're out\" initiative, which meant that families could be evicted from public housing because one member (or a guest) had committed even a minor offense. People released from prison with no money, no job, and nowhere to go could no longer return home to their loved ones living in federally assisted housing without placing the entire family at risk of eviction. Purging \"the criminal element\" from public housing played well on the evening news, but no provisions were made for people and families as they were forced out on the street. By the end of Clinton's presidency, more than half of working-age African-American men in many large urban areas were saddled with criminal records and subject to legalized discrimination in employment, housing, access to education, and basic public benefits-relegated to a permanent second-class status eerily reminiscent of Jim Crow. It is difficult to overstate the damage that's been done. Generations have been lost to the prison system; countless families have been torn apart or rendered homeless; and a school-to-prison pipeline has been born that shuttles young people from their decrepit, underfunded schools to brand-new high-tech prisons. * * * It didn't have to be like this. As a nation, we had a choice. Rather than spending billions of dollars constructing a vast new penal system, those billions could have been spent putting young people to work in inner-city communities and investing in their schools so they might have some hope of making the transition from an industrial to a service-based economy. Constructive interventions would have been good not only for African Americans trapped in ghettos, but for blue-collar workers of all colors. At the very least, Democrats could have fought to prevent the further destruction of black communities rather than ratcheting up the wars declared on them. Of course, it can be said that it's unfair to criticize the Clintons for punishing black people so harshly, given that many black people were on board with the \"get tough\" movement too. It is absolutely true that black communities back then were in a state of crisis, and that many black activists and politicians were desperate to get violent offenders off the streets. What is often missed, however, is that most of those black activists and politicians weren't asking only for toughness. They were also demanding investment in their schools, better housing, jobs programs for young people, economic-stimulus packages, drug treatment on demand, and better access to healthcare. In the end, they wound up with police and prisons. To say that this was what black people wanted is misleading at best. By 1996, the penal budget was twice the amount that had been allocated to food stamps. To be fair, the Clintons now feel bad about how their politics and policies have worked out for black people. Bill says that he \"overshot the mark\" with his crime policies; and Hillary has put forth a plan to ban racial profiling, eliminate the sentencing disparities between crack and cocaine, and abolish private prisons, among other measures. But what about a larger agenda that would not just reverse some of the policies adopted during the Clinton era, but would rebuild the communities decimated by them? If you listen closely here, you'll notice that Hillary Clinton is still singing the same old tune in a slightly different key. She is arguing that we ought not be seduced by Bernie's rhetoric because we must be \"pragmatic,\" \"face political realities,\" and not get tempted to believe that we can fight for economic justice and win. When politicians start telling you that it is \"unrealistic\" to support candidates who want to build a movement for greater equality, fair wages, universal healthcare, and an end to corporate control of our political system, it's probably best to leave the room. This is not an endorsement for Bernie Sanders, who after all voted for the 1994 crime bill. I also tend to agree with Ta-Nehisi Coates that the way the Sanders campaign handled the question of reparations is one of many signs that Bernie doesn't quite get what's at stake in serious dialogues about racial justice. He was wrong to dismiss reparations as \"divisive,\" as though centuries of slavery, segregation, discrimination, ghettoization, and stigmatization aren't worthy of any specific acknowledgement or remedy. But recognizing that Bernie, like Hillary, has blurred vision when it comes to race is not the same thing as saying their views are equally problematic. Sanders opposed the 1996 welfare-reform law. He also opposed bank deregulation and the Iraq War, both of which Hillary supported, and both of which have proved disastrous. In short, there is such a thing as a lesser evil, and Hillary is not it.

Young black men weren't looking for work at high rates during the Clinton era because they were now behind bars-out of sight, out of mind, and no longer counted in poverty and unemployment statistics. To make matters worse, the federal safety net for poor families was torn to shreds by the Clinton administration in its effort to \"end welfare as we know it.\" In his 1996 State of the Union address, given during his re-election campaign, Clinton declared that \"the era of big government is over\" and immediately sought to prove it by dismantling the federal welfare system known as Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC). The welfare-reform legislation that he signed-which Hillary Clinton ardently supported then and characterized as a success as recently as 2008-replaced the federal safety net with a block grant to the states, imposed a five-year lifetime limit on welfare assistance, added work requirements, barred undocumented immigrants from licensed professions, and slashed overall public welfare funding by $54 billion (some was later restored). They are not just gangs of kids anymore...they are 'super-predators.' -Hillary Clinton, speaking in support of the 1994 crime bill Experts and pundits disagree about the true impact of welfare reform, but one thing seems clear: Extreme poverty doubled to 1.5 million in the decade and a half after the law was passed. What is extreme poverty? US households are considered to be in extreme poverty if they are surviving on cash incomes of no more than $2 per person per day in any given month. We tend to think of extreme poverty existing in Third World countries, but here in the United States, shocking numbers of people are struggling to survive on less money per month than many families spend in one evening dining out. Currently, the United States, the richest nation on the planet, has one of the highest child-poverty rates in the developed world. Despite claims that radical changes in crime and welfare policy were driven by a desire to end big government and save taxpayer dollars, the reality is that the Clinton administration didn't reduce the amount of money devoted to the management of the urban poor; it changed what the funds would be used for. Billions of dollars were slashed from public-housing and child-welfare budgets and transferred to the mass-incarceration machine. By 1996, the penal budget was twice the amount that had been allocated to food stamps. During Clinton's tenure, funding for public housing was slashed by $17 billion (a reduction of 61 percent), while funding for corrections was boosted by $19 billion (an increase of 171 percent), according to sociologist Loïc Wacquant \"effectively making the construction of prisons the nation's main housing program for the urban poor.\" Bill Clinton championed discriminatory laws against formerly incarcerated people that have kept millions of Americans locked in a cycle of poverty and desperation. The Clinton administration eliminated Pell grants for prisoners seeking higher education to prepare for their release, supported laws denying federal financial aid to students with drug convictions, and signed legislation imposing a lifetime ban on welfare and food stamps for anyone convicted of a felony drug offense-an exceptionally harsh provision given the racially biased drug war that was raging in inner cities. Perhaps most alarming, Clinton also made it easier for public-housing agencies to deny shelter to anyone with any sort of criminal history (even an arrest without conviction) and championed the \"one strike and you're out\" initiative, which meant that families could be evicted from public housing because one member (or a guest) had committed even a minor offense. People released from prison with no money, no job, and nowhere to go could no longer return home to their loved ones living in federally assisted housing without placing the entire family at risk of eviction. Purging \"the criminal element\" from public housing played well on the evening news, but no provisions were made for people and families as they were forced out on the street. By the end of Clinton's presidency, more than half of working-age African-American men in many large urban areas were saddled with criminal records and subject to legalized discrimination in employment, housing, access to education, and basic public benefits-relegated to a permanent second-class status eerily reminiscent of Jim Crow. It is difficult to overstate the damage that's been done. Generations have been lost to the prison system; countless families have been torn apart or rendered homeless; and a school-to-prison pipeline has been born that shuttles young people from their decrepit, underfunded schools to brand-new high-tech prisons. * * * It didn't have to be like this. As a nation, we had a choice. Rather than spending billions of dollars constructing a vast new penal system, those billions could have been spent putting young people to work in inner-city communities and investing in their schools so they might have some hope of making the transition from an industrial to a service-based economy. Constructive interventions would have been good not only for African Americans trapped in ghettos, but for blue-collar workers of all colors. At the very least, Democrats could have fought to prevent the further destruction of black communities rather than ratcheting up the wars declared on them. Of course, it can be said that it's unfair to criticize the Clintons for punishing black people so harshly, given that many black people were on board with the \"get tough\" movement too. It is absolutely true that black communities back then were in a state of crisis, and that many black activists and politicians were desperate to get violent offenders off the streets. What is often missed, however, is that most of those black activists and politicians weren't asking only for toughness. They were also demanding investment in their schools, better housing, jobs programs for young people, economic-stimulus packages, drug treatment on demand, and better access to healthcare. In the end, they wound up with police and prisons. To say that this was what black people wanted is misleading at best. By 1996, the penal budget was twice the amount that had been allocated to food stamps. To be fair, the Clintons now feel bad about how their politics and policies have worked out for black people. Bill says that he \"overshot the mark\" with his crime policies; and Hillary has put forth a plan to ban racial profiling, eliminate the sentencing disparities between crack and cocaine, and abolish private prisons, among other measures. But what about a larger agenda that would not just reverse some of the policies adopted during the Clinton era, but would rebuild the communities decimated by them? If you listen closely here, you'll notice that Hillary Clinton is still singing the same old tune in a slightly different key. She is arguing that we ought not be seduced by Bernie's rhetoric because we must be \"pragmatic,\" \"face political realities,\" and not get tempted to believe that we can fight for economic justice and win. When politicians start telling you that it is \"unrealistic\" to support candidates who want to build a movement for greater equality, fair wages, universal healthcare, and an end to corporate control of our political system, it's probably best to leave the room. This is not an endorsement for Bernie Sanders, who after all voted for the 1994 crime bill. I also tend to agree with Ta-Nehisi Coates that the way the Sanders campaign handled the question of reparations is one of many signs that Bernie doesn't quite get what's at stake in serious dialogues about racial justice. He was wrong to dismiss reparations as \"divisive,\" as though centuries of slavery, segregation, discrimination, ghettoization, and stigmatization aren't worthy of any specific acknowledgement or remedy. But recognizing that Bernie, like Hillary, has blurred vision when it comes to race is not the same thing as saying their views are equally problematic. Sanders opposed the 1996 welfare-reform law. He also opposed bank deregulation and the Iraq War, both of which Hillary supported, and both of which have proved disastrous. In short, there is such a thing as a lesser evil, and Hillary is not it. The biggest problem with Bernie, in the end, is that he's running as a Democrat-as a member of a political party that not only capitulated to right-wing demagoguery but is now owned and controlled by a relatively small number of millionaires and billionaires. Yes, Sanders has raised millions from small donors, but should he become president, he would also become part of what he has otherwise derided as \"the establishment.\" Even if Bernie's racial-justice views evolve, I hold little hope that a political revolution will occur within the Democratic Party without a sustained outside movement forcing truly transformational change. I am inclined to believe that it would be easier to build a new party than to save the Democratic Party from itself. LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS Email Of course, the idea of building a new political party terrifies most progressives, who understandably fear that it would open the door for a right-wing extremist to get elected. So we play the game of lesser evils. This game has gone on for decades. W.E.B. Du Bois, the eminent scholar and co-founder of the NAACP, shocked many when he refused to play along with this game in the 1956 election, defending his refusal to vote on the grounds that \"there is but one evil party with two names, and it will be elected despite all I do or say.\" While the true losers and winners of this game are highly predictable, the game of lesser evils makes for great entertainment and can now be viewed 24 hours a day on cable-news networks. Hillary believes that she can win this game in 2016 because this time she's got us, the black vote, in her back pocket-her lucky card. She may be surprised to discover that the younger generation no longer wants to play her game. Or maybe not. Maybe we'll all continue to play along and pretend that we don't know how it will turn out in the end. Hopefully, one day, we'll muster the courage to join together in a revolutionary movement with people of all colors who believe that basic human rights and economic, racial, and gender justice are not unreasonable, pie-in-the-sky goals. After decades of getting played, the sleeping giant just might wake up, stretch its limbs, and tell both parties: Game over. Move aside. It's time to reshuffle this deck.\n\nClinton championed the idea of a federal \"three strikes\" law in his 1994 State of the Union address and, months later, signed a $30 billion crime bill that created dozens of new federal capital crimes, mandated life sentences for some three-time offenders, and authorized more than $16 billion for state prison grants and the expansion of police forces. The legislation was hailed by mainstream-media outlets as a victory for the Democrats, who \"were able to wrest the crime issue from the Republicans and make it their own.\" When Clinton left office in 2001, the United States had the highest rate of incarceration in the world. Human Rights Watch reported that in seven states, African Americans constituted 80 to 90 percent of all drug offenders sent to prison, even though they were no more likely than whites to use or sell illegal drugs. Prison admissions for drug offenses reached a level in 2000 for African Americans more than 26 times the level in 1983. All of the presidents since 1980 have contributed to mass incarceration, but as Equal Justice Initiative founder Bryan Stevenson recently observed, \"President Clinton's tenure was the worst.\" Some might argue that it's unfair to judge Hillary Clinton for the policies her husband championed years ago. But Hillary wasn't picking out china while she was first lady. She bravely broke the mold and redefined that job in ways no woman ever had before. She not only campaigned for Bill; she also wielded power and significant influence once he was elected, lobbying for legislation and other measures. That record, and her statements from that era, should be scrutinized. In her support for the 1994 crime bill, for example, she used racially coded rhetoric to cast black children as animals. \"They are not just gangs of kids anymore,\" she said. \"They are often the kinds of kids that are called 'super-predators.' No conscience, no empathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first we have to bring them to heel.\" Both Clintons now express regret over the crime bill, and Hillary says she supports criminal-justice reforms to undo some of the damage that was done by her husband's administration. But on the campaign trail, she continues to invoke the economy and country that Bill Clinton left behind as a legacy she would continue. So what exactly did the Clinton economy look like for black Americans? Taking a hard look at this recent past is about more than just a choice between two candidates. It's about whether the Democratic Party can finally reckon with what its policies have done to African-American communities, and whether it can redeem itself and rightly earn the loyalty of black voters. * * * An oft-repeated myth about the Clinton administration is that although it was overly tough on crime back in the 1990s, at least its policies were good for the economy and for black unemployment rates. The truth is more troubling. As unemployment rates sank to historically low levels for white Americans in the 1990s, the jobless rate among black men in their 20s who didn't have a college degree rose to its highest level ever. This increase in joblessness was propelled by the skyrocketing incarceration rate. Why is this not common knowledge? Because government statistics like poverty and unemployment rates do not include incarcerated people. As Harvard sociologist Bruce Western explains: \"Much of the optimism about declines in racial inequality and the power of the US model of economic growth is misplaced once we account for the invisible poor, behind the walls of America's prisons and jails.\" When Clinton left office in 2001, the true jobless rate for young, non-college-educated black men (including those behind bars) was 42 percent. This figure was never reported. Instead, the media claimed that unemployment rates for African Americans had fallen to record lows, neglecting to mention that this miracle was possible only because incarceration rates were now at record highs. Young black men weren't looking for work at high rates during the Clinton era because they were now behind bars-out of sight, out of mind, and no longer counted in poverty and unemployment statistics.

Du Bois, the eminent scholar and co-founder of the NAACP, shocked many when he refused to play along with this game in the 1956 election, defending his refusal to vote on the grounds that \"there is but one evil party with two names, and it will be elected despite all I do or say.\" While the true losers and winners of this game are highly predictable, the game of lesser evils makes for great entertainment and can now be viewed 24 hours a day on cable-news networks. Hillary believes that she can win this game in 2016 because this time she's got us, the black vote, in her back pocket-her lucky card. She may be surprised to discover that the younger generation no longer wants to play her game. Or maybe not. Maybe we'll all continue to play along and pretend that we don't know how it will turn out in the end. Hopefully, one day, we'll muster the courage to join together in a revolutionary movement with people of all colors who believe that basic human rights and economic, racial, and gender justice are not unreasonable, pie-in-the-sky goals. After decades of getting played, the sleeping giant just might wake up, stretch its limbs, and tell both parties: Game over. Move aside. It's time to reshuffle this deck.\n\nSome might argue that it's unfair to judge Hillary Clinton for the policies her husband championed years ago. But Hillary wasn't picking out china while she was first lady. She bravely broke the mold and redefined that job in ways no woman ever had before. She not only campaigned for Bill; she also wielded power and significant influence once he was elected, lobbying for legislation and other measures. That record, and her statements from that era, should be scrutinized. In her support for the 1994 crime bill, for example, she used racially coded rhetoric to cast black children as animals. \"They are not just gangs of kids anymore,\" she said. \"They are often the kinds of kids that are called 'super-predators.' No conscience, no empathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first we have to bring them to heel.\" Both Clintons now express regret over the crime bill, and Hillary says she supports criminal-justice reforms to undo some of the damage that was done by her husband's administration. But on the campaign trail, she continues to invoke the economy and country that Bill Clinton left behind as a legacy she would continue. So what exactly did the Clinton economy look like for black Americans? Taking a hard look at this recent past is about more than just a choice between two candidates. It's about whether the Democratic Party can finally reckon with what its policies have done to African-American communities, and whether it can redeem itself and rightly earn the loyalty of black voters. * * * An oft-repeated myth about the Clinton administration is that although it was overly tough on crime back in the 1990s, at least its policies were good for the economy and for black unemployment rates. The truth is more troubling. As unemployment rates sank to historically low levels for white Americans in the 1990s, the jobless rate among black men in their 20s who didn't have a college degree rose to its highest level ever. This increase in joblessness was propelled by the skyrocketing incarceration rate. Why is this not common knowledge? Because government statistics like poverty and unemployment rates do not include incarcerated people. As Harvard sociologist Bruce Western explains: \"Much of the optimism about declines in racial inequality and the power of the US model of economic growth is misplaced once we account for the invisible poor, behind the walls of America's prisons and jails.\" When Clinton left office in 2001, the true jobless rate for young, non-college-educated black men (including those behind bars) was 42 percent. This figure was never reported. Instead, the media claimed that unemployment rates for African Americans had fallen to record lows, neglecting to mention that this miracle was possible only because incarceration rates were now at record highs. Young black men weren't looking for work at high rates during the Clinton era because they were now behind bars-out of sight, out of mind, and no longer counted in poverty and unemployment statistics. To make matters worse, the federal safety net for poor families was torn to shreds by the Clinton administration in its effort to \"end welfare as we know it.\" In his 1996 State of the Union address, given during his re-election campaign, Clinton declared that \"the era of big government is over\" and immediately sought to prove it by dismantling the federal welfare system known as Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC). The welfare-reform legislation that he signed-which Hillary Clinton ardently supported then and characterized as a success as recently as 2008-replaced the federal safety net with a block grant to the states, imposed a five-year lifetime limit on welfare assistance, added work requirements, barred undocumented immigrants from licensed professions, and slashed overall public welfare funding by $54 billion (some was later restored). They are not just gangs of kids anymore...they are 'super-predators.' -Hillary Clinton, speaking in support of the 1994 crime bill Experts and pundits disagree about the true impact of welfare reform, but one thing seems clear: Extreme poverty doubled to 1.5 million in the decade and a half after the law was passed. What is extreme poverty? US households are considered to be in extreme poverty if they are surviving on cash incomes of no more than $2 per person per day in any given month. We tend to think of extreme poverty existing in Third World countries, but here in the United States, shocking numbers of people are struggling to survive on less money per month than many families spend in one evening dining out. Currently, the United States, the richest nation on the planet, has one of the highest child-poverty rates in the developed world. Despite claims that radical changes in crime and welfare policy were driven by a desire to end big government and save taxpayer dollars, the reality is that the Clinton administration didn't reduce the amount of money devoted to the management of the urban poor; it changed what the funds would be used for. Billions of dollars were slashed from public-housing and child-welfare budgets and transferred to the mass-incarceration machine. By 1996, the penal budget was twice the amount that had been allocated to food stamps. During Clinton's tenure, funding for public housing was slashed by $17 billion (a reduction of 61 percent), while funding for corrections was boosted by $19 billion (an increase of 171 percent), according to sociologist Loïc Wacquant \"effectively making the construction of prisons the nation's main housing program for the urban poor.\" Bill Clinton championed discriminatory laws against formerly incarcerated people that have kept millions of Americans locked in a cycle of poverty and desperation. The Clinton administration eliminated Pell grants for prisoners seeking higher education to prepare for their release, supported laws denying federal financial aid to students with drug convictions, and signed legislation imposing a lifetime ban on welfare and food stamps for anyone convicted of a felony drug offense-an exceptionally harsh provision given the racially biased drug war that was raging in inner cities. Perhaps most alarming, Clinton also made it easier for public-housing agencies to deny shelter to anyone with any sort of criminal history (even an arrest without conviction) and championed the \"one strike and you're out\" initiative, which meant that families could be evicted from public housing because one member (or a guest) had committed even a minor offense. People released from prison with no money, no job, and nowhere to go could no longer return home to their loved ones living in federally assisted housing without placing the entire family at risk of eviction. Purging \"the criminal element\" from public housing played well on the evening news, but no provisions were made for people and families as they were forced out on the street. By the end of Clinton's presidency, more than half of working-age African-American men in many large urban areas were saddled with criminal records and subject to legalized discrimination in employment, housing, access to education, and basic public benefits-relegated to a permanent second-class status eerily reminiscent of Jim Crow. It is difficult to overstate the damage that's been done. Generations have been lost to the prison system; countless families have been torn apart or rendered homeless; and a school-to-prison pipeline has been born that shuttles young people from their decrepit, underfunded schools to brand-new high-tech prisons. * * * It didn't have to be like this. As a nation, we had a choice. Rather than spending billions of dollars constructing a vast new penal system, those billions could have been spent putting young people to work in inner-city communities and investing in their schools so they might have some hope of making the transition from an industrial to a service-based economy. Constructive interventions would have been good not only for African Americans trapped in ghettos, but for blue-collar workers of all colors. At the very least, Democrats could have fought to prevent the further destruction of black communities rather than ratcheting up the wars declared on them. Of course, it can be said that it's unfair to criticize the Clintons for punishing black people so harshly, given that many black people were on board with the \"get tough\" movement too. It is absolutely true that black communities back then were in a state of crisis, and that many black activists and politicians were desperate to get violent offenders off the streets. What is often missed, however, is that most of those black activists and politicians weren't asking only for toughness. They were also demanding investment in their schools, better housing, jobs programs for young people, economic-stimulus packages, drug treatment on demand, and better access to healthcare. In the end, they wound up with police and prisons. To say that this was what black people wanted is misleading at best. By 1996, the penal budget was twice the amount that had been allocated to food stamps. To be fair, the Clintons now feel bad about how their politics and policies have worked out for black people. Bill says that he \"overshot the mark\" with his crime policies; and Hillary has put forth a plan to ban racial profiling, eliminate the sentencing disparities between crack and cocaine, and abolish private prisons, among other measures. But what about a larger agenda that would not just reverse some of the policies adopted during the Clinton era, but would rebuild the communities decimated by them? If you listen closely here, you'll notice that Hillary Clinton is still singing the same old tune in a slightly different key. She is arguing that we ought not be seduced by Bernie's rhetoric because we must be \"pragmatic,\" \"face political realities,\" and not get tempted to believe that we can fight for economic justice and win. When politicians start telling you that it is \"unrealistic\" to support candidates who want to build a movement for greater equality, fair wages, universal healthcare, and an end to corporate control of our political system, it's probably best to leave the room. This is not an endorsement for Bernie Sanders, who after all voted for the 1994 crime bill. I also tend to agree with Ta-Nehisi Coates that the way the Sanders campaign handled the question of reparations is one of many signs that Bernie doesn't quite get what's at stake in serious dialogues about racial justice. He was wrong to dismiss reparations as \"divisive,\" as though centuries of slavery, segregation, discrimination, ghettoization, and stigmatization aren't worthy of any specific acknowledgement or remedy. But recognizing that Bernie, like Hillary, has blurred vision when it comes to race is not the same thing as saying their views are equally problematic. Sanders opposed the 1996 welfare-reform law. He also opposed bank deregulation and the Iraq War, both of which Hillary supported, and both of which have proved disastrous. In short, there is such a thing as a lesser evil, and Hillary is not it. The biggest problem with Bernie, in the end, is that he's running as a Democrat-as a member of a political party that not only capitulated to right-wing demagoguery but is now owned and controlled by a relatively small number of millionaires and billionaires. Yes, Sanders has raised millions from small donors, but should he become president, he would also become part of what he has otherwise derided as \"the establishment.\" Even if Bernie's racial-justice views evolve, I hold little hope that a political revolution will occur within the Democratic Party without a sustained outside movement forcing truly transformational change. I am inclined to believe that it would be easier to build a new party than to save the Democratic Party from itself. LIKE THIS?

Du Bois, the eminent scholar and co-founder of the NAACP, shocked many when he refused to play along with this game in the 1956 election, defending his refusal to vote on the grounds that \"there is but one evil party with two names, and it will be elected despite all I do or say.\" While the true losers and winners of this game are highly predictable, the game of lesser evils makes for great entertainment and can now be viewed 24 hours a day on cable-news networks. Hillary believes that she can win this game in 2016 because this time she's got us, the black vote, in her back pocket-her lucky card. She may be surprised to discover that the younger generation no longer wants to play her game. Or maybe not. Maybe we'll all continue to play along and pretend that we don't know how it will turn out in the end. Hopefully, one day, we'll muster the courage to join together in a revolutionary movement with people of all colors who believe that basic human rights and economic, racial, and gender justice are not unreasonable, pie-in-the-sky goals. After decades of getting played, the sleeping giant just might wake up, stretch its limbs, and tell both parties: Game over. Move aside. It's time to reshuffle this deck.\n\nAn oft-repeated myth about the Clinton administration is that although it was overly tough on crime back in the 1990s, at least its policies were good for the economy and for black unemployment rates. The truth is more troubling. As unemployment rates sank to historically low levels for white Americans in the 1990s, the jobless rate among black men in their 20s who didn't have a college degree rose to its highest level ever. This increase in joblessness was propelled by the skyrocketing incarceration rate. Why is this not common knowledge? Because government statistics like poverty and unemployment rates do not include incarcerated people. As Harvard sociologist Bruce Western explains: \"Much of the optimism about declines in racial inequality and the power of the US model of economic growth is misplaced once we account for the invisible poor, behind the walls of America's prisons and jails.\" When Clinton left office in 2001, the true jobless rate for young, non-college-educated black men (including those behind bars) was 42 percent. This figure was never reported. Instead, the media claimed that unemployment rates for African Americans had fallen to record lows, neglecting to mention that this miracle was possible only because incarceration rates were now at record highs. Young black men weren't looking for work at high rates during the Clinton era because they were now behind bars-out of sight, out of mind, and no longer counted in poverty and unemployment statistics. To make matters worse, the federal safety net for poor families was torn to shreds by the Clinton administration in its effort to \"end welfare as we know it.\" In his 1996 State of the Union address, given during his re-election campaign, Clinton declared that \"the era of big government is over\" and immediately sought to prove it by dismantling the federal welfare system known as Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC). The welfare-reform legislation that he signed-which Hillary Clinton ardently supported then and characterized as a success as recently as 2008-replaced the federal safety net with a block grant to the states, imposed a five-year lifetime limit on welfare assistance, added work requirements, barred undocumented immigrants from licensed professions, and slashed overall public welfare funding by $54 billion (some was later restored). They are not just gangs of kids anymore...they are 'super-predators.' -Hillary Clinton, speaking in support of the 1994 crime bill Experts and pundits disagree about the true impact of welfare reform, but one thing seems clear: Extreme poverty doubled to 1.5 million in the decade and a half after the law was passed. What is extreme poverty? US households are considered to be in extreme poverty if they are surviving on cash incomes of no more than $2 per person per day in any given month. We tend to think of extreme poverty existing in Third World countries, but here in the United States, shocking numbers of people are struggling to survive on less money per month than many families spend in one evening dining out. Currently, the United States, the richest nation on the planet, has one of the highest child-poverty rates in the developed world. Despite claims that radical changes in crime and welfare policy were driven by a desire to end big government and save taxpayer dollars, the reality is that the Clinton administration didn't reduce the amount of money devoted to the management of the urban poor; it changed what the funds would be used for. Billions of dollars were slashed from public-housing and child-welfare budgets and transferred to the mass-incarceration machine. By 1996, the penal budget was twice the amount that had been allocated to food stamps. During Clinton's tenure, funding for public housing was slashed by $17 billion (a reduction of 61 percent), while funding for corrections was boosted by $19 billion (an increase of 171 percent), according to sociologist Loïc Wacquant \"effectively making the construction of prisons the nation's main housing program for the urban poor.\" Bill Clinton championed discriminatory laws against formerly incarcerated people that have kept millions of Americans locked in a cycle of poverty and desperation. The Clinton administration eliminated Pell grants for prisoners seeking higher education to prepare for their release, supported laws denying federal financial aid to students with drug convictions, and signed legislation imposing a lifetime ban on welfare and food stamps for anyone convicted of a felony drug offense-an exceptionally harsh provision given the racially biased drug war that was raging in inner cities. Perhaps most alarming, Clinton also made it easier for public-housing agencies to deny shelter to anyone with any sort of criminal history (even an arrest without conviction) and championed the \"one strike and you're out\" initiative, which meant that families could be evicted from public housing because one member (or a guest) had committed even a minor offense. People released from prison with no money, no job, and nowhere to go could no longer return home to their loved ones living in federally assisted housing without placing the entire family at risk of eviction. Purging \"the criminal element\" from public housing played well on the evening news, but no provisions were made for people and families as they were forced out on the street. By the end of Clinton's presidency, more than half of working-age African-American men in many large urban areas were saddled with criminal records and subject to legalized discrimination in employment, housing, access to education, and basic public benefits-relegated to a permanent second-class status eerily reminiscent of Jim Crow. It is difficult to overstate the damage that's been done. Generations have been lost to the prison system; countless families have been torn apart or rendered homeless; and a school-to-prison pipeline has been born that shuttles young people from their decrepit, underfunded schools to brand-new high-tech prisons. * * * It didn't have to be like this. As a nation, we had a choice. Rather than spending billions of dollars constructing a vast new penal system, those billions could have been spent putting young people to work in inner-city communities and investing in their schools so they might have some hope of making the transition from an industrial to a service-based economy. Constructive interventions would have been good not only for African Americans trapped in ghettos, but for blue-collar workers of all colors. At the very least, Democrats could have fought to prevent the further destruction of black communities rather than ratcheting up the wars declared on them. Of course, it can be said that it's unfair to criticize the Clintons for punishing black people so harshly, given that many black people were on board with the \"get tough\" movement too. It is absolutely true that black communities back then were in a state of crisis, and that many black activists and politicians were desperate to get violent offenders off the streets. What is often missed, however, is that most of those black activists and politicians weren't asking only for toughness. They were also demanding investment in their schools, better housing, jobs programs for young people, economic-stimulus packages, drug treatment on demand, and better access to healthcare. In the end, they wound up with police and prisons. To say that this was what black people wanted is misleading at best. By 1996, the penal budget was twice the amount that had been allocated to food stamps. To be fair, the Clintons now feel bad about how their politics and policies have worked out for black people. Bill says that he \"overshot the mark\" with his crime policies; and Hillary has put forth a plan to ban racial profiling, eliminate the sentencing disparities between crack and cocaine, and abolish private prisons, among other measures. But what about a larger agenda that would not just reverse some of the policies adopted during the Clinton era, but would rebuild the communities decimated by them? If you listen closely here, you'll notice that Hillary Clinton is still singing the same old tune in a slightly different key. She is arguing that we ought not be seduced by Bernie's rhetoric because we must be \"pragmatic,\" \"face political realities,\" and not get tempted to believe that we can fight for economic justice and win. When politicians start telling you that it is \"unrealistic\" to support candidates who want to build a movement for greater equality, fair wages, universal healthcare, and an end to corporate control of our political system, it's probably best to leave the room. This is not an endorsement for Bernie Sanders, who after all voted for the 1994 crime bill. I also tend to agree with Ta-Nehisi Coates that the way the Sanders campaign handled the question of reparations is one of many signs that Bernie doesn't quite get what's at stake in serious dialogues about racial justice. He was wrong to dismiss reparations as \"divisive,\" as though centuries of slavery, segregation, discrimination, ghettoization, and stigmatization aren't worthy of any specific acknowledgement or remedy. But recognizing that Bernie, like Hillary, has blurred vision when it comes to race is not the same thing as saying their views are equally problematic. Sanders opposed the 1996 welfare-reform law. He also opposed bank deregulation and the Iraq War, both of which Hillary supported, and both of which have proved disastrous. In short, there is such a thing as a lesser evil, and Hillary is not it. The biggest problem with Bernie, in the end, is that he's running as a Democrat-as a member of a political party that not only capitulated to right-wing demagoguery but is now owned and controlled by a relatively small number of millionaires and billionaires. Yes, Sanders has raised millions from small donors, but should he become president, he would also become part of what he has otherwise derided as \"the establishment.\" Even if Bernie's racial-justice views evolve, I hold little hope that a political revolution will occur within the Democratic Party without a sustained outside movement forcing truly transformational change. I am inclined to believe that it would be easier to build a new party than to save the Democratic Party from itself. LIKE THIS?

By the end of Clinton's presidency, more than half of working-age African-American men in many large urban areas were saddled with criminal records and subject to legalized discrimination in employment, housing, access to education, and basic public benefits-relegated to a permanent second-class status eerily reminiscent of Jim Crow. It is difficult to overstate the damage that's been done. Generations have been lost to the prison system; countless families have been torn apart or rendered homeless; and a school-to-prison pipeline has been born that shuttles young people from their decrepit, underfunded schools to brand-new high-tech prisons. * * * It didn't have to be like this. As a nation, we had a choice. Rather than spending billions of dollars constructing a vast new penal system, those billions could have been spent putting young people to work in inner-city communities and investing in their schools so they might have some hope of making the transition from an industrial to a service-based economy. Constructive interventions would have been good not only for African Americans trapped in ghettos, but for blue-collar workers of all colors. At the very least, Democrats could have fought to prevent the further destruction of black communities rather than ratcheting up the wars declared on them. Of course, it can be said that it's unfair to criticize the Clintons for punishing black people so harshly, given that many black people were on board with the \"get tough\" movement too. It is absolutely true that black communities back then were in a state of crisis, and that many black activists and politicians were desperate to get violent offenders off the streets. What is often missed, however, is that most of those black activists and politicians weren't asking only for toughness. They were also demanding investment in their schools, better housing, jobs programs for young people, economic-stimulus packages, drug treatment on demand, and better access to healthcare. In the end, they wound up with police and prisons. To say that this was what black people wanted is misleading at best. By 1996, the penal budget was twice the amount that had been allocated to food stamps. To be fair, the Clintons now feel bad about how their politics and policies have worked out for black people. Bill says that he \"overshot the mark\" with his crime policies; and Hillary has put forth a plan to ban racial profiling, eliminate the sentencing disparities between crack and cocaine, and abolish private prisons, among other measures. But what about a larger agenda that would not just reverse some of the policies adopted during the Clinton era, but would rebuild the communities decimated by them? If you listen closely here, you'll notice that Hillary Clinton is still singing the same old tune in a slightly different key. She is arguing that we ought not be seduced by Bernie's rhetoric because we must be \"pragmatic,\" \"face political realities,\" and not get tempted to believe that we can fight for economic justice and win. When politicians start telling you that it is \"unrealistic\" to support candidates who want to build a movement for greater equality, fair wages, universal healthcare, and an end to corporate control of our political system, it's probably best to leave the room. This is not an endorsement for Bernie Sanders, who after all voted for the 1994 crime bill. I also tend to agree with Ta-Nehisi Coates that the way the Sanders campaign handled the question of reparations is one of many signs that Bernie doesn't quite get what's at stake in serious dialogues about racial justice. He was wrong to dismiss reparations as \"divisive,\" as though centuries of slavery, segregation, discrimination, ghettoization, and stigmatization aren't worthy of any specific acknowledgement or remedy. But recognizing that Bernie, like Hillary, has blurred vision when it comes to race is not the same thing as saying their views are equally problematic. Sanders opposed the 1996 welfare-reform law. He also opposed bank deregulation and the Iraq War, both of which Hillary supported, and both of which have proved disastrous. In short, there is such a thing as a lesser evil, and Hillary is not it. The biggest problem with Bernie, in the end, is that he's running as a Democrat-as a member of a political party that not only capitulated to right-wing demagoguery but is now owned and controlled by a relatively small number of millionaires and billionaires. Yes, Sanders has raised millions from small donors, but should he become president, he would also become part of what he has otherwise derided as \"the establishment.\" Even if Bernie's racial-justice views evolve, I hold little hope that a political revolution will occur within the Democratic Party without a sustained outside movement forcing truly transformational change. I am inclined to believe that it would be easier to build a new party than to save the Democratic Party from itself. LIKE THIS? GET MORE OF OUR BEST REPORTING AND ANALYSIS Email Of course, the idea of building a new political party terrifies most progressives, who understandably fear that it would open the door for a right-wing extremist to get elected. So we play the game of lesser evils. This game has gone on for decades. W.E.B. Du Bois, the eminent scholar and co-founder of the NAACP, shocked many when he refused to play along with this game in the 1956 election, defending his refusal to vote on the grounds that \"there is but one evil party with two names, and it will be elected despite all I do or say.\" While the true losers and winners of this game are highly predictable, the game of lesser evils makes for great entertainment and can now be viewed 24 hours a day on cable-news networks. Hillary believes that she can win this game in 2016 because this time she's got us, the black vote, in her back pocket-her lucky card. She may be surprised to discover that the younger generation no longer wants to play her game. Or maybe not. Maybe we'll all continue to play along and pretend that we don't know how it will turn out in the end. Hopefully, one day, we'll muster the courage to join together in a revolutionary movement with people of all colors who believe that basic human rights and economic, racial, and gender justice are not unreasonable, pie-in-the-sky goals. After decades of getting played, the sleeping giant just might wake up, stretch its limbs, and tell both parties: Game over. Move aside. It's time to reshuffle this deck.\n\nDespite claims that radical changes in crime and welfare policy were driven by a desire to end big government and save taxpayer dollars, the reality is that the Clinton administration didn't reduce the amount of money devoted to the management of the urban poor; it changed what the funds would be used for. Billions of dollars were slashed from public-housing and child-welfare budgets and transferred to the mass-incarceration machine. By 1996, the penal budget was twice the amount that had been allocated to food stamps. During Clinton's tenure, funding for public housing was slashed by $17 billion (a reduction of 61 percent), while funding for corrections was boosted by $19 billion (an increase of 171 percent), according to sociologist Loïc Wacquant \"effectively making the construction of prisons the nation's main housing program for the urban poor.\" Bill Clinton championed discriminatory laws against formerly incarcerated people that have kept millions of Americans locked in a cycle of poverty and desperation. The Clinton administration eliminated Pell grants for prisoners seeking higher education to prepare for their release, supported laws denying federal financial aid to students with drug convictions, and signed legislation imposing a lifetime ban on welfare and food stamps for anyone convicted of a felony drug offense-an exceptionally harsh provision given the racially biased drug war that was raging in inner cities. Perhaps most alarming, Clinton also made it easier for public-housing agencies to deny shelter to anyone with any sort of criminal history (even an arrest without conviction) and championed the \"one strike and you're out\" initiative, which meant that families could be evicted from public housing because one member (or a guest) had committed even a minor offense. People released from prison with no money, no job, and nowhere to go could no longer return home to their loved ones living in federally assisted housing without placing the entire family at risk of eviction.

It is absolutely true that black communities back then were in a state of crisis, and that many black activists and politicians were desperate to get violent offenders off the streets. What is often missed, however, is that most of those black activists and politicians weren't asking only for toughness. They were also demanding investment in their schools, better housing, jobs programs for young people, economic-stimulus packages, drug treatment on demand, and better access to healthcare. In the end, they wound up with police and prisons. To say that this was what black people wanted is misleading at best. By 1996, the penal budget was twice the amount that had been allocated to food stamps. To be fair, the Clintons now feel bad about how their politics and policies have worked out for black people. Bill says that he \"overshot the mark\" with his crime policies; and Hillary has put forth a plan to ban racial profiling, eliminate the sentencing disparities between crack and cocaine, and abolish private prisons, among other measures. But what about a larger agenda that would not just reverse some of the policies adopted during the Clinton era, but would rebuild the communities decimated by them? If you listen closely here, you'll notice that Hillary Clinton is still singing the same old tune in a slightly different key. She is arguing that we ought not be seduced by Bernie's rhetoric because we must be \"pragmatic,\" \"face political realities,\" and not get tempted to believe that we can fight for economic justice and win. When politicians start telling you that it is \"unrealistic\" to support candidates who want to build a movement for greater equality, fair wages, universal healthcare, and an end to corporate control of our political system, it's probably best to leave the room. This is not an endorsement for Bernie Sanders, who after all voted for the 1994 crime bill. I also tend to agree with Ta-Nehisi Coates that the way the Sanders campaign handled the question of reparations is one of many signs that Bernie doesn't quite get what's at stake in serious dialogues about racial justice. He was wrong to dismiss reparations as \"divisive,\" as though centuries of slavery, segregation, discrimination, ghettoization, and stigmatization aren't worthy of any specific acknowledgement or remedy. But recognizing that Bernie, like Hillary, has blurred vision when it comes to race is not the same thing as saying their views are equally problematic. Sanders opposed the 1996 welfare-reform law. He also opposed bank deregulation and the Iraq War, both of which Hillary supported, and both of which have proved disastrous. In short, there is such a thing as a lesser evil, and Hillary is not it. The biggest problem with Bernie, in the end, is that he's running as a Democrat-as a member of a political party that not only capitulated to right-wing demagoguery but is now owned and controlled by a relatively small number of millionaires and billionaires. Yes, Sanders has raised millions from small donors, but should he become president, he would also become part of what he has otherwise derided as \"the establishment.\" Even if Bernie's racial-justice views evolve, I hold little hope that a political revolution will occur within the Democratic Party without a sustained outside movement forcing truly transformational change. I am inclined to believe that it would be easier to build a new party than to save the Democratic Party from itself. LIKE THIS?

So we play the game of lesser evils. This game has gone on for decades. W.E.B. Du Bois, the eminent scholar and co-founder of the NAACP, shocked many when he refused to play along with this game in the 1956 election, defending his refusal to vote on the grounds that \"there is but one evil party with two names, and it will be elected despite all I do or say.\" While the true losers and winners of this game are highly predictable, the game of lesser evils makes for great entertainment and can now be viewed 24 hours a day on cable-news networks. Hillary believes that she can win this game in 2016 because this time she's got us, the black vote, in her back pocket-her lucky card. She may be surprised to discover that the younger generation no longer wants to play her game. Or maybe not. Maybe we'll all continue to play along and pretend that we don't know how it will turn out in the end. Hopefully, one day, we'll muster the courage to join together in a revolutionary movement with people of all colors who believe that basic human rights and economic, racial, and gender justice are not unreasonable, pie-in-the-sky goals. After decades of getting played, the sleeping giant just might wake up, stretch its limbs, and tell both parties: Game over. Move aside. It's time to reshuffle this deck.\n\nIt didn't have to be like this. As a nation, we had a choice. Rather than spending billions of dollars constructing a vast new penal system, those billions could have been spent putting young people to work in inner-city communities and investing in their schools so they might have some hope of making the transition from an industrial to a service-based economy. Constructive interventions would have been good not only for African Americans trapped in ghettos, but for blue-collar workers of all colors.

And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

He beat his next closest competitor, Bernie Sanders, by almost 30 points. In the first state where the African American vote has been a consequential force, Biden's consistent strength among black folks took the day: He won 61 percent of African American voters, according to exit polling. Many people, including the Biden campaign, will tell you that Biden's strong showing is an indication of his \"electability\" in a general election. Biden has been running as the \"safe\" choice to take on Trump. African Americans, especially those in the South, who have the most to lose with the reelection of a bigot who courts the favor of white supremacists, would seem to agree. Biden has led in the polling among black people since he set foot in this race. It's reasonable to ask why. Biden has spent most of the campaign stepping on rakes and losing himself in foggy memories of times gone by. His debate performances have been listless. His speeches and town halls have been heavy on empathy but horrifying on factual accuracy. The reality of Biden feels considerably less safe than the idea of Biden. In fact, it has been Biden's apparent weakness that is primarily responsible for making Mike Bloomberg think he can swoop in and buy the nomination. Biden's actual history and policy record also makes him a weird choice to be the leader among African American voters. Biden has gone to great lengths to claim credit for the successes of the Obama administration-to the point where I'm starting to wonder what Obama did all day while Biden was busy making things happen. Biden claims to have been \"there\" for everything that's been done by Democrats for the past 40 years. But only the good parts! The now reviled 1994 crime bill, which Biden wrote; his shameful treatment of Anita Hill during the Clarence Thomas confirmation hearings; his opposition to busing and friendliness with segregationists-all of that is part of his record too. But none of it has hurt him. If Kamala Harris had benefited from this kind of selective memory when it comes to policy, this entire race might be different. Biden's strength among African Americans in South Carolina was not universal. Black people are not a monolith, and the exit polling showed a split that has become familiar during this primary. Bernie Sanders narrowly beat Joe Biden among black voters under 30. And Bernie didn't even have to \"back that azz up\" to get it. But Biden won a sweeping 75 percent of black voters over 60.

The argument would be offensive if it weren't also so dumb. Older black voters in South Carolina have a lifetime of education and experience dealing with the most persistent threat to their safety and rights in this country: white people. My read of the South Carolina vote is that black people know exactly what they're doing, and why. Joe Biden is the indictment older black folks have issued against white America. His support is buttressed by chunks of the black community who have determined that most white people are selfish and cannot be trusted to do the right thing. They believe if you make white people choose between their money and their morality-between candidates like Sanders or Elizabeth Warren (who somehow finished fifth in South Carolina, behind Pete Buttigieg) and candidates like Biden and Michael Bloomberg-they will choose their money every time and twice on Election Day. The New York Times interviewed a 39-year-old African American voter in South Carolina. I found his analysis instructive. He told the Times : \"Black voters know white voters better than white voters know themselves.... So yeah, we'll back Biden, because we know who white America will vote for in the general election in a way they may not tell a pollster or the media.\" This debate about what white America is really prepared to do has been the most vital one in the black community since the start of the primary. It transcends policy, \"likeability,\" or even \"electability\" at least as the media seems to use the term. It goes to the core of what black people think white people are willing to do, plotted against what we know they are capable of. The Root 's politics editor, Dr. Jason Johnson , put it like this to me in one of our text debates on this crucial matter: \"Voting for Bernie Sanders requires that black people believe that white people will do something they've never done: willingly and openly share the economic bounty of the United States.\" He's not wrong, and what's more, older black voters in South Carolina know he's not wrong. Black people are ready for an economically progressive candidate. But they've tried that before and been rebuffed. African American voters in South Carolina have gone with the eventual Democratic nominee in every primary over the past 32 years, except on two occasions. And those two exceptions are notable. In 1988, during a campaign where Joe Biden would have to drop out because of a plagiarism scandal, native South Carolinian Jesse Jackson easily won the state , crushing eventual nominee Michael Dukakis. Jackson would go on to win 92 percent of the black vote over the course of the 1988 primary, which is a higher percentage than Barack Obama won in 2008. So maybe that's an anomaly. But the other exception to black South Carolinian foresight was in 2004. That was the year former North Carolina senator John Edwards narrowly defeated eventual nominee John Kerry among black voters, and that was in a primary in which Reverend Al Sharpton was on the ballot and pulled in 17 percent of the black vote. People forget this now because of his personal failings, but Edwards ran a campaign grounded in an unapologetically anti-poverty message. Moreover, the 2004 Democratic primary transpired in the face of one of the worst presidents black people had encountered in at least a few years, George W. Bush. But in an election that felt every bit as critically important as this one-and if those left to die on the rooftops of New Orleans could speak, they'd tell you that 2004 was as important as this one-black people in South Carolina went with the economic progressive of that time. Nationally, Kerry did end up winning the black vote, but only with 56 percent support, a lower percentage than any other nominee over the past 32 years except Dukakis. More from Mystal Sonia Sotomayor Just Issued a Serious Warning About the Supreme Court Elie Mystal FDR Got Everything that Trump Does Not About Thanksgiving John Nichols If We Don't Reform the Supreme Court, Nothing Else Will Matter Elie Mystal So when you ask older black people what the white electorate, Democratic or Republican, are capable of, they remember. They remember that this country has spent the better part of 40 years lauding the racially destructive policies of Ronald Reagan. They remember that actual progressive choices, like Jackson and Edwards, were rejected by white Democrats. They remember that white people failed to turn on George W. Bush, despite his legacy of incompetence and torture, and instead reelected him. They remember that the majority of white people did not vote for the first black president, spent eight years attacking his every move, and then replaced him with the most small-minded bigot they could find, rejecting an immensely qualified white woman in the process. Learning these lessons about what white people will do is part of growing up black in this country. Many young black people start out assuming that white people are better than they've shown, that the stories of past white failures are things white people have learned from. I have small children and I certainly want them to believe that they will encounter better, more reliable white people in their life than I have encountered in my own. I want them to believe in coalitions, and in allies. But I'm also aging. The hope I try to impart to my kids sometimes feels fraudulent, like I'm raising them for a world I no longer believe will exist. Eventually, I'll be old enough and strong enough to do for my children what so many black parents have to do: rip the innocence from them and teach them how things really are. Older black people know white people. They've suffered because of them more than anybody else. In the first primary of 2020 in which black people had a voice, the message I heard from the elders was \"Vote for Biden, because white people gonna white.\" I'm, at best, one last election away from fully agreeing with them.\n\nMany people, including the Biden campaign, will tell you that Biden's strong showing is an indication of his \"electability\" in a general election.

The argument would be offensive if it weren't also so dumb. Older black voters in South Carolina have a lifetime of education and experience dealing with the most persistent threat to their safety and rights in this country: white people. My read of the South Carolina vote is that black people know exactly what they're doing, and why. Joe Biden is the indictment older black folks have issued against white America. His support is buttressed by chunks of the black community who have determined that most white people are selfish and cannot be trusted to do the right thing. They believe if you make white people choose between their money and their morality-between candidates like Sanders or Elizabeth Warren (who somehow finished fifth in South Carolina, behind Pete Buttigieg) and candidates like Biden and Michael Bloomberg-they will choose their money every time and twice on Election Day. The New York Times interviewed a 39-year-old African American voter in South Carolina. I found his analysis instructive. He told the Times : \"Black voters know white voters better than white voters know themselves.... So yeah, we'll back Biden, because we know who white America will vote for in the general election in a way they may not tell a pollster or the media.\" This debate about what white America is really prepared to do has been the most vital one in the black community since the start of the primary. It transcends policy, \"likeability,\" or even \"electability\" at least as the media seems to use the term. It goes to the core of what black people think white people are willing to do, plotted against what we know they are capable of. The Root 's politics editor, Dr. Jason Johnson , put it like this to me in one of our text debates on this crucial matter: \"Voting for Bernie Sanders requires that black people believe that white people will do something they've never done: willingly and openly share the economic bounty of the United States.\" He's not wrong, and what's more, older black voters in South Carolina know he's not wrong. Black people are ready for an economically progressive candidate. But they've tried that before and been rebuffed. African American voters in South Carolina have gone with the eventual Democratic nominee in every primary over the past 32 years, except on two occasions. And those two exceptions are notable. In 1988, during a campaign where Joe Biden would have to drop out because of a plagiarism scandal, native South Carolinian Jesse Jackson easily won the state , crushing eventual nominee Michael Dukakis. Jackson would go on to win 92 percent of the black vote over the course of the 1988 primary, which is a higher percentage than Barack Obama won in 2008. So maybe that's an anomaly. But the other exception to black South Carolinian foresight was in 2004. That was the year former North Carolina senator John Edwards narrowly defeated eventual nominee John Kerry among black voters, and that was in a primary in which Reverend Al Sharpton was on the ballot and pulled in 17 percent of the black vote. People forget this now because of his personal failings, but Edwards ran a campaign grounded in an unapologetically anti-poverty message. Moreover, the 2004 Democratic primary transpired in the face of one of the worst presidents black people had encountered in at least a few years, George W. Bush. But in an election that felt every bit as critically important as this one-and if those left to die on the rooftops of New Orleans could speak, they'd tell you that 2004 was as important as this one-black people in South Carolina went with the economic progressive of that time. Nationally, Kerry did end up winning the black vote, but only with 56 percent support, a lower percentage than any other nominee over the past 32 years except Dukakis. More from Mystal Sonia Sotomayor Just Issued a Serious Warning About the Supreme Court Elie Mystal FDR Got Everything that Trump Does Not About Thanksgiving John Nichols If We Don't Reform the Supreme Court, Nothing Else Will Matter Elie Mystal So when you ask older black people what the white electorate, Democratic or Republican, are capable of, they remember. They remember that this country has spent the better part of 40 years lauding the racially destructive policies of Ronald Reagan. They remember that actual progressive choices, like Jackson and Edwards, were rejected by white Democrats. They remember that white people failed to turn on George W. Bush, despite his legacy of incompetence and torture, and instead reelected him. They remember that the majority of white people did not vote for the first black president, spent eight years attacking his every move, and then replaced him with the most small-minded bigot they could find, rejecting an immensely qualified white woman in the process. Learning these lessons about what white people will do is part of growing up black in this country. Many young black people start out assuming that white people are better than they've shown, that the stories of past white failures are things white people have learned from. I have small children and I certainly want them to believe that they will encounter better, more reliable white people in their life than I have encountered in my own. I want them to believe in coalitions, and in allies. But I'm also aging. The hope I try to impart to my kids sometimes feels fraudulent, like I'm raising them for a world I no longer believe will exist. Eventually, I'll be old enough and strong enough to do for my children what so many black parents have to do: rip the innocence from them and teach them how things really are. Older black people know white people. They've suffered because of them more than anybody else. In the first primary of 2020 in which black people had a voice, the message I heard from the elders was \"Vote for Biden, because white people gonna white.\" I'm, at best, one last election away from fully agreeing with them.\n\nBiden's strength among African Americans in South Carolina was not universal. Black people are not a monolith, and the exit polling showed a split that has become familiar during this primary. Bernie Sanders narrowly beat Joe Biden among black voters under 30. And Bernie didn't even have to \"back that azz up\" to get it. But Biden won a sweeping 75 percent of black voters over 60. Current Issue View our current issue What explains that?

That was the year former North Carolina senator John Edwards narrowly defeated eventual nominee John Kerry among black voters, and that was in a primary in which Reverend Al Sharpton was on the ballot and pulled in 17 percent of the black vote. People forget this now because of his personal failings, but Edwards ran a campaign grounded in an unapologetically anti-poverty message. Moreover, the 2004 Democratic primary transpired in the face of one of the worst presidents black people had encountered in at least a few years, George W. Bush. But in an election that felt every bit as critically important as this one-and if those left to die on the rooftops of New Orleans could speak, they'd tell you that 2004 was as important as this one-black people in South Carolina went with the economic progressive of that time. Nationally, Kerry did end up winning the black vote, but only with 56 percent support, a lower percentage than any other nominee over the past 32 years except Dukakis.

They remember that this country has spent the better part of 40 years lauding the racially destructive policies of Ronald Reagan. They remember that actual progressive choices, like Jackson and Edwards, were rejected by white Democrats. They remember that white people failed to turn on George W. Bush, despite his legacy of incompetence and torture, and instead reelected him. They remember that the majority of white people did not vote for the first black president, spent eight years attacking his every move, and then replaced him with the most small-minded bigot they could find, rejecting an immensely qualified white woman in the process. Learning these lessons about what white people will do is part of growing up black in this country. Many young black people start out assuming that white people are better than they've shown, that the stories of past white failures are things white people have learned from. I have small children and I certainly want them to believe that they will encounter better, more reliable white people in their life than I have encountered in my own. I want them to believe in coalitions, and in allies. But I'm also aging. The hope I try to impart to my kids sometimes feels fraudulent, like I'm raising them for a world I no longer believe will exist. Eventually, I'll be old enough and strong enough to do for my children what so many black parents have to do: rip the innocence from them and teach them how things really are. Older black people know white people. They've suffered because of them more than anybody else. In the first primary of 2020 in which black people had a voice, the message I heard from the elders was \"Vote for Biden, because white people gonna white.\" I'm, at best, one last election away from fully agreeing with them.\n\nThis debate about what white America is really prepared to do has been the most vital one in the black community since the start of the primary. It transcends policy, \"likeability,\" or even \"electability\" at least as the media seems to use the term. It goes to the core of what black people think white people are willing to do, plotted against what we know they are capable of. The Root 's politics editor, Dr. Jason Johnson , put it like this to me in one of our text debates on this crucial matter: \"Voting for Bernie Sanders requires that black people believe that white people will do something they've never done: willingly and openly share the economic bounty of the United States.\" He's not wrong, and what's more, older black voters in South Carolina know he's not wrong. Black people are ready for an economically progressive candidate. But they've tried that before and been rebuffed. African American voters in South Carolina have gone with the eventual Democratic nominee in every primary over the past 32 years, except on two occasions. And those two exceptions are notable. In 1988, during a campaign where Joe Biden would have to drop out because of a plagiarism scandal, native South Carolinian Jesse Jackson easily won the state , crushing eventual nominee Michael Dukakis. Jackson would go on to win 92 percent of the black vote over the course of the 1988 primary, which is a higher percentage than Barack Obama won in 2008. So maybe that's an anomaly.

      "text": "How the Black Vote Became a Monolith\n\nBy Theodore R. Johnson\n\nWith posters by Kennedy Prints\n\nIn the autumn of 2008, just a few weeks after my 33rd birthday, I cast a ballot for the first time. Up to that point, serving in the military seemed like more than sufficient civic engagement and provided a ready excuse for voluntarily opting out of several elections. By the time Barack Obama won the Democratic primary, I was an officer who'd spent more than a decade in the Navy and not a second in a voting booth. This apathy does not run in the blood. My parents are products of the civil rights era and the Jim Crow South, and as such religiously exercised their hard-won right to vote. In my formative years, the basic disposition of the house politics pressed together progressive demands for racial equality with the Black conservatism of marathon church services that stretched deep into Southern Sunday afternoons. We differed in degree on any number of issues, but elections were where our politics really diverged. Like much of Black America, my mother is a lifelong Democrat, staying true even as the party vacillated in and out of her good graces. My father is a somewhat perfunctory Republican, an heirloom affiliation inherited from Black Americans' early-20th-century preference for the party of Lincoln and consecrated in the familial name carried by my grandfather, father and me: Theodore Roosevelt Johnson.\n\nBut in November 2008, all three of us checked the box for Obama, our votes helping deliver North Carolina to a Democratic presidential nominee for only the second time in 40 years. My father had crossed party lines once before, in 1984, when Jesse Jackson ran for president. Jackson's business-size Afro, jet black mustache and Carolina preacher's staccato cadence transformed the typically all-white affair of presidential contests. \"If a Black man had the opportunity to sit in the Oval Office,\" my father told me years later, \"I wasn't going to sit on the sidelines.\"\n\nTo hear more audio stories from publishers like The New York Times, download Audm for iPhone or Android .\n\nJackson championed a policy agenda nowhere close to my father's conservatism. But his rationale for supporting Jackson hinged on a basic proposition, informed by generations of Black experience in America: The thousands of lesser decisions made in rooms of power can matter far more for racial equality than campaign promises and platforms. Senator Kamala Harris crisply captured this sentiment while campaigning last year, declaring a simple truth : \"It matters who's in those rooms.\" My rationale for voting for the first time was much like my father's two decades earlier. I was not going to stand idly by if there was a chance to put a Black man in those rooms.\n\nOn the surface, my family's choices may seem unremarkable. As David Carlin wrote in the Catholic magazine Crisis, weeks before the 2008 election: \"Of course, Black voters would vote overwhelmingly for any Democratic presidential candidate, not just Obama. But they will very probably vote even more overwhelmingly for Obama.\" More pernicious are the caricatures of Black Americans as self-absorbed and unthinking voters. When Colin Powell, George W. Bush's first secretary of state, announced that he would be endorsing Obama, the conservative media personality Rush Limbaugh criticized him for choosing race over \"the nation and its welfare\" and several years later suggested Powell would vote for Obama again because \"melanin is thicker than water.\" The conservative pundit Pat Buchanan, the Georgia state representative Vernon Jones and others have recently resurfaced the old and ugly allegation that Black people are trapped on the Democratic \"plantation,\" dociles practicing a politics of grievance and gratuity that makes them beholden to the party.\n\nNear-unanimity is undeniably a persistent feature of Black voting behavior. From 1964 to 2008, according to a report by the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, an average of 88 percent of Black votes went to the Democratic Party's presidential nominees, a number that increased to 93 percent in the last three presidential elections. And yet, as my family experience demonstrates, a monolithic Black electorate does not mean uniform Black politics.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

The legacy of the last eight years is complicated.\n\nDonald J. Trump has been talking up his economic record for Black voters. The legacy of the last eight years is complicated.\n\nA central question in the presidential election is which of the past two administrations did more to improve the lives of Black workers. Credit... Al Drago/Bloomberg\n\nSupported by\n\nBy Jordyn Holman and Jeanna Smialek\n\nThe 2024 election could be won or lost on the strength of the Black vote, which could in turn be won or lost based on the strength of the American economy. So it is no surprise that candidates are paying a lot of attention - and lip service - to which of the past two administrations did more to improve the lives of Black workers.\n\nFormer President Donald J. Trump, the Republican candidate, makes big claims about the gains Black workers made under his watch, saying that he had the \"lowest African American unemployment rate\" and \"the lowest African American poverty rate ever recorded.\" But those measures improved even more under the Biden administration, with joblessness touching a record low and poverty falling even further .\n\n\"Currently, Black workers are doing better than they were in 2019,\" said Valerie Wilson, a labor economist whose work focuses on racial disparities at the liberal-leaning advocacy organization EPI Action.\n\nThat may sound like an unambiguous victory for Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, especially when paired with a recent increase in homeownership rates for Black families and the fact that the Black unemployment rate dipped in September.\n\nBut even with those notable wins, the economy has not been uniformly good for all Black Americans. Rapid inflation has been tough on many families, chipping away at solid wage growth. Although the labor market for Black workers was the strongest ever recorded for much of 2022 and 2023, the long shadow of big price increases may be keeping people from feeling like they are getting ahead.\n\nIn fact, nearly three in four Black respondents rated the economy as fair or poor, a recent New York Times/Siena College poll of Black likely voters found. And that is notable, because Black voters do tend to prioritize economic issues - not just for themselves, but also for the overall welfare of Black people - when they are thinking about whether and how to vote.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

So we convened a very special Thanksgiving focus group to try and understand why.\n\nCredit...\n\nSupported by\n\nHosted by Astead W. Herndon\n\nProduced by Anna Foley and Elisa Gutierrez\n\nPhotographs by Akilah Townsend\n\nReporting from Flossmoor, Ill.\n\ntranscript\n\nThis transcript was created using speech recognition software. While it has been reviewed by human transcribers, it may contain errors. Please review the episode audio before quoting from this transcript and email transcripts@nytimes.com with any questions.\n\nNot to pick favorites, but Thanksgiving has always been my favorite holiday. So when I thought about the show this week, there was only one place I knew it could be -\n\nHi, Mom.\n\nHey!\n\nHi.\n\nHome.\n\nHey!\n\nMom, this is Alisa. This is Anna.\n\nHi.\n\nThey're our producers on \"The Run-Up.\"\n\nHi.\n\nAnd we're so excited -\n\nSo nice to meet you. Come on in.\n\nHi. Thank you so much.\n\nI wanted to come home with my colleagues and microphones in tow to do the one thing you're not traditionally supposed to do on Thanksgiving - talk politics at the dinner table. Specifically, I wanted to ask my family and friends about one political question that's recently been all over the news - the changing relationship between Black voters and the Democratic Party.\n\nThe numbers are staggering. In a new poll of battleground states, from Siena College and The New York Times, 22 of Black voters said they would support Donald Trump over Joe Biden in a hypothetical rematch in 2024. That's compared to the 8 percent Trump carried nationally in 2020.\n\nNow it's just one poll, but it comes after the 2022 midterms, where Black turnout was one of the Democrats' weakest points. And anecdotally, it tracks with what I see in my own life, as Black people I grew up with, especially younger Black people and Black men, feel less and less tied to the Democratic Party. Some are more open to voting for Republicans or not voting at all. So I decided to conduct a little focus group -\n\nHi, everyone.\n\n- with a group of Black voters I know very well.\n\nWhat's the food?\n\nWell, the food is turkey. We have smothered chicken, which is a traditional kind of a thing, smothered chicken with mashed potatoes.\n\nMy mom and sisters prepared a feast.\n\nAnd we also have a beef roast.\n\nLow key. Very low key.\n\nYeah, yeah, just a little something slight, just a little turkey.\n\n- and a homemade dessert buffet for my sister, Angelica.\n\nNow I could take the pound cake, and the ginger molasses I'm curious about.\n\nYou have your eye on that?\n\nYeah.\n\nLet's pray for the food. Lord, we thank -\n\nOnce my father blessed the food -\n\nThank you, Lord, for Astead, \"The Run-Up.\" Thank you for all of the family, friends, who are here tonight. I pray you'll bless the food, sanctify it and purify for the nourishment of our bodies.\n\n- he turned the night over to me -\n\nAnd keep them in Jesus's name. Amen.\n\nAmen.\n\n- to play a role I was familiar with. Yes, a reporter, but also the family instigator, to ask a question that no one poll can answer - are Black voters really souring on Democrats? And if so, why? From \"The New York Times,\" I'm Astead Herndon. This is \"The Run-Up.\"\n\nWe do a traditional thanks here at Thanksgiving. We're grateful to God for another year. And I want to take two minutes, and you could just shout out one word or one sentence of what you're thankful for because I know everybody in this room, this year, something has occurred in your lives that you are thankful for. So I'm going to start us off, and I'm going to take the generic one - I'm thankful for life. Thankful for life. Thankful that I am seeing another year.\n\nAbout 30 people showed up to this dinner -\n\nI'm thankful to be 70.\n\nAmen.\n\n[CLAPPING]\n\n- some friends, family, and people I've known forever through my dad's church.\n\nI'm thankful for growth, growing and expanding.\n\nI'm thankful for my right mind. Yeah.\n\nI grew up in the Southwest suburbs of Chicago, in a town called Flossmoor, around a lot of Black families that were pretty similar to my own.\n\nI'm thankful for life health, strength, all of the above.\n\nMiddle class, college-educated parents, Black people who had left the city in search of something better. And not too far from my house, my dad started a church, Hallelujah Temple.\n\nI got one. I'm thankful for peace.\n\nIt's a smaller congregation that's much less uniform in terms of class and education, but it was always politically active. And it's where I learned to talk about politics and ask questions about what people believe and why.\n\nI'm thankful to see everybody here. I mean, it's really amazing to see this collection of people. And it really matters to me that you all are represented in what we're doing about the election because this is a show that's about giving dignity to people. And I think that's a value that you all taught me. So thank you.\n\nMost of the people here have been voting for Democrats their entire lives. And some people remember a time when Black people couldn't vote at all. So I hope they could put this political moment in its necessary perspective.\n\nYou're good?\n\nYes.\n\nSo as folks grabbed their dinner, I sat down at the dining room table.\n\nThese weren't from a box.\n\nBut they both kind of melt in your mouth, too, though.\n\nYes, it does.\n\nMy plan was to divide people into groups that corresponded with divisions that we saw within the poll. I started with a group of older Black folks, people who represented a demographic that helped put Biden into office and that has largely stuck by him. So while these folks are historically reliable Democratic voters, I thought they could still help us provide important context to what's been happening that's led to this point.\n\nWould you all consider yourselves Democrats?\n\nYes.\n\nI do.\n\nWhy do you think Black people have voted for Democrats in historically such high numbers?\n\nWell, I think one reason, it seems like - and this is only my opinion - when you look at the Republican, it seems like they were in such a different bracket than what we were in.\n\nIn what way?\n\nFinancially. It seemed like they were always on the top, and Democrat doesn't mean that we're on the bottom, though. But they just seem like they always seem so much higher than the Democrats.\n\nIt seemed like Republicans care more about richer people.\n\nYeah, and they are more concerned about staying rich and we staying where we are, you know? It doesn't seem like they ever want us to get to the plateau that we meet where they're at.\n\nI think also, in the Democratic Party, they have opened their arms to the point where maybe Black folks feel that it's all inclusion. Although we might not agree with everything that the Democratic Party stands for, they don't discriminate against homosexuals or if you're poor or if you do have money. It's more of a social thing whereas when you talk about the Republican parties, it's about self.\n\nAnd so it's like, how much more can I get? It was the haves and have nots. And so with Democrats, it was always - it was a hope. I think about Jesse Jackson. Keep hope alive, you know. And so the Democratic Party has always been, for Black folk, the possibility of doing something, if you will.\n\nFor you all, like when you think about your time as a Democrat, what's the times the party has made you the most proud?\n\nObama.\n\nObama.\n\nObama. And I think we all pulled together. That was the time that you really saw all of us as a race pull together to get him in.\n\nAnd we should be clear. Like, we're in Chicago. I mean, this was a place where it was specifically happening. What did it feel like in 2008 when that was happening? Do you remember how it felt for you?\n\nIt was like we were in control. We had power, you know?\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd when we go back to the civil rights movement, then we saw a fulfillment of all they had worked for.\n\nThat's what it felt like.\n\nYes, all they had worked for, you know.\n\nI remember you and I being the only ones at the church that thought he could win.\n\nPut that on the record. I was right early, y'all.\n\nI can remember you and I arguing with your parents. Because they were like, it's not going to happen. The Black man - it's not going to happen.\n\nI was like, I simply think it might.\n\nAnd we were the only two saying, oh, he's going to win. He's going to win. And so I had to put that out there on the record.\n\nI appreciate that, brother Reggie.\n\nI believed he was going to win. I mean, because everybody was pulling everybody to go to the poll. This was the biggest turnout that we have ever - they said they were taking people off the street, you know, you got to go vote.\n\nI'm wondering, with Trump's election and the four years that came after that, did it cause you to think differently about the Obama years before that? Or were those separate events?\n\nThey were separate.\n\nThose are separate?\n\nI think it was separate.\n\nIn 2016, one of the reasons it did happen is because you saw a big dropoff in some Black turnout from 2012 to 2016. Even the last recent midterms - one of the low points for the Democrats in what was otherwise a pretty good year was that Black people don't seem to have the same relationship with the Democratic Party. Do you think the relationship between Black people and Democrats are changing? Or as Democrats, do you think maybe that's just one cycle or another, but this is a kind of connection that will last?\n\nI think it's about the generation that's doing the voting or not voting. You know, and then you have to remember, we were there, most of us, during the '70s and the '60s, you know. And we were there, watching all about the marches and everything. And they don't really know about that. It's not being taught in school.\n\nYou think the dropoff in Democrats might be a generational thing?\n\nYes.\n\nIf there was an issue that matters to you that you want Democrats to deliver on, what is it?\n\nWell, you have, of course, the economy, which they're looking out for. And you have crime. And really -\n\nYou feel like they're looking out for that?\n\nHmm. Well, I think that's the frustration. Most of them, they advocate for these particular issues. But the problem is, you just don't see much of any change, any results. So that's what turns off a lot of people from politics.\n\nThey just give up, because the parents, even though they vote, it seems like their vote is not making a difference. So that's the struggle there. So sometimes it's about pushing your agenda, letting people know what you're doing.\n\nBecause you have another voice on the other side. Basically, they're screaming, saying the Democrats are not doing anything. And they scream real loud. And of course, the louder they scream, that's the voice we hear.\n\nAnd ultimately, a lot of people believe that. So the Democrats really have to do a better job of basically vocalizing what they're doing, showing the results. But to answer your question, yes, I believe they're making an effort. But everybody at this table knows it's almost impossible to get anything done in Congress.\n\nYes.\n\nAnd that's where the fight is, and that's what it is basically - a fight. And if you don't have the patience to endure the fight, you give up. But I think we have to encourage. You talk about generation. Encourage the next generation to stay in the fight.\n\nYes.\n\nOne of the things that comes up as we talk to people is they feel less and less interested in politics. Do you feel people backing away from the fight? It does feel like some of that is in the air.\n\nI mean, I won't call names, but you talk to certain young people, and they didn't even vote. I say, how do you not vote in the presidential election?\n\nI'm an election judge, and I've been one for years. And I could physically see where the turnout was, like, null and void, you know. And that was both for young people and the older people. They were not coming out to vote.\n\nYeah. A question I had was, do you feel proud to be a Democrat? Do you feel proud to be an American?\n\n[INTERPOSING VOICES]\n\nI've been all over the world, man. I can tell you, this is the best thing going - American. Is everything great here? No. Could things be better? Yes. The seniors, they price-gouging on the medicine, and the rich are getting richer. It's like, how much money do you need?\n\nDo I feel proud to be a Democrat? I wish I could be an independent, you know. But we really don't have representation in this region with independents. So I have to go other - I can never be a Republican, especially now, because of anybody that supported Trump and all the foolishness and lies that he told - it's no matter what your message is.\n\nLike, even everybody on the ticket right now that's running - you all supported him. And he lied openly, and you believed the lie, and you supported him and you backed him. So for me, you can never get anything from me because of that.\n\nAnd so I can't say - I'm not going to say lesser of two evils, but I will not - because of people died for me to have this right, I have to vote. You know, and so Democrat is the closest I can go.\n\nRight. Right.\n\nY'all, thank you so much. We're going to talk to some more folks, but I really appreciate it. Thank you so much.\n\nWhat they're getting at - a sense that younger Black voters have been turning away from Biden and the Democrats - that's supported in the data. In that New York Times-Siena poll, Biden support among nonwhite voters under 45 plummeted. a group that he carried by nearly 40 points in 2020, he now led by just six.\n\nThis erosion is one of the biggest reasons Biden's numbers look so bad right now. And it's giving hope to Republicans that they can win a greater share of Black voters in 2024. So just as people were going back for seconds -\n\nI know Astead from school, I guess.\n\nI know Astead from the church, but it's like family, you know.\n\nKind of grew up together. His father is one of my mentors. Yes, sir.\n\nI gathered a group of younger Black people at the same dining room table. Would you all consider yourselves Democrats?\n\nYes.\n\nHave you always considered yourself Democrats?\n\nYes.\n\nI'll ask this question, the same question I asked the older generation before y'all. Why do you think Black people vote in such numbers for the Democratic Party? It's unique. Like, among demographic groups in America, nobody votes for one party in this big of a number. Why do you think Black people vote for Democrats so consistently?\n\nI think it's what you're taught, kind of, within your family, that this is what you are. And so you don't go any way different from it. So you're like, my mom was a Democrat, so I'm going to be that, without really looking into the facts and finding out for yourself what you really want to be.\n\nI do agree with Danielle. This is, like, the household is Democrat. But also, there's a thought that Black people are not Republicans. It's just the bottom line.\n\nAnd Republicans as for the rich people. And you have all of those tags along with being a Republican. And it's all about money and not service.\n\nThis came up in the last one, too, and I thought it was really interesting. Because sometimes you see Black folks say, I think people vote for Democrats because Republicans are racist. But that's not what the explanation you gave or the people last time. It was that it's there for rich people.\n\nYeah.\n\nYou think it's much more of a class thing than it is a race thing.\n\nYeah, it's beneficial to the higher class, those with more money.\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nI think the Democratic Party focuses more on our interests, the rights of the Constitution. Because we didn't always have rights, so the Democratic Party seems to focus more with our interests.\n\nYou're saying there's an understanding that Black people can lose rights, and there's something about the Democrats that seem like they're at least safeguarding some of it. OK. And I think this is a thing I specifically wanted to focus on with this group. In the last one, we really talked about, the arc of civil rights movements through Obama and how they feel that sense of pride.\n\nAnd I kind of want to think about post-Obama, and like, how has that been, in terms of shifting a relationship - or has it shifted in the relationship with Democrats? I think about that high point of 2008, the hope, for younger folks, especially - do you also feel like that?\n\nI know I've been let down by Obama. Do you hear me?\n\nI've been heavily -\n\nWhy? Why?\n\nI feel as though he could have did more for us. I feel as though he - specifically Chicagoans. That's where he comes from. After seeing Trump and all that he did, it was like, man, Obama, you could have did the same thing. You could have been rogue, too, before your people.\n\nAnd the fact that he did not do it, or even spoke towards doing it. It was disheartening, and it affected a lot of the mentees that I got trying to push them to vote, to even vote anymore.\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nLike, the young people that I'm trying to push to start back voting was upset at the movement of Obama, so they stopped voting altogether. They lost faith in the political system.\n\nThere is a kind of unspoken thing about Obama era - I think it's kind of especially true in Chicago - that it wasn't meeting some of expectations. But it's especially spoken in this group, and it's not spoken in the last group, right? They speak about just the dignity of him in office, about the power of having a Black family in that place. What I hear differently from younger people is a \"OK, what else?\"\n\nAnd that's what I want to hear from you. What is the else? Democrats talk about Blackness a lot more. They talk about race a lot more. That's not - it's not clear to me that that's what people want, but is it? I don't know. But they definitely say the words more.\n\nI mean, if you're not, like, pandering and talking about hot sauce in your bag, you know -\n\nI think if you're being, like, real and genuine, I think people can pick up on it. It's like, yes, you want to know that your interest is heard, but then I don't - kind of like maybe Biden - I think that was a lot of people's gripe, that he was kind of just maybe pandering. And then, when he was in office, it was like, OK, I got your vote, but then went somewhere else.\n\nI mean, it's talked about more, which is fine. You know, and so now, the issue is before us. But we're still taking a lot of L's in a lot of areas with violence, police, even education. So it's - yeah, we're talking about it. But then what?\n\nBecause in this case, we're still on the losing end, if not in a worse state than before when it wasn't talked about. Because now that it's talked about, we're losing some of the ground that civil rights movement gained for us. So I just think that talking about it - yeah, it's good, but now what?\n\nAs a followup to the first question I asked about why do you think Black people vote for Democrats in such numbers, do you think that's changing? I mean, do you think the relationship between the Black people and the party is changing?\n\nThe sad part about it is - yes, even though my job - like, these younger - like, so you have more Black people that are owning their own businesses. They're entrepreneurs. And so the benefit that they're seeing is that, oh, it's helping me financially. And so -\n\nTo vote Republican.\n\nYes. And so you know, what have they done for me? The Republican Party can give me these tax cuts and give me this and give me that. It boils down to those type of issues. And then, they look at the Democratic party, and they're like, well, Biden - I mean, look at this. We got all these immigrants. He ain't doing this. He ain't doing that. But it's always the plus for the Republican side, because it's benefiting them tangibly.\n\nMy fear is that a lot of young Democrats are leaning towards Republican, because of the financial gain that they got during the pandemic, of course. And yeah, those checks, thank you. But my fear is the blindfold to what really is happening like affirmative action - no one's saying anything about that.\n\n10 years from now, we're going to feel that. You're going to see that in these jobs. You're going to see all of that. But if we don't say anything about that now, that will be a problem.\n\nNot to harp on the affirmative action thing, but I think it kind of goes to your point, though, too, and explaining. Because that changed through the Supreme Court. So like, you kind of have to educate, like, the young people as well, like, that process, so then they're not once again disappointed in our Demo -\n\nRight, or student loans, right? Knocked down by the Supreme Court, but there's a lot of people holding it against Biden - that he didn't make student loans go away, right?\n\nBut - and Biden, like, he kind of ran on that, but I think maybe that's how he got a lot of the millennials. We're like, oh, student loans, but then we, all of us, like, didn't understand, OK, it could get blocked. And what power does he really have? And then, so a lot of people are disappointed with Biden because of that. They're like, if he runs again, I still have tons of student loan debt. So he's not getting my vote.\n\nYeah.\n\nOur generation - and not everybody in this room, but we are more so about self, and what is it going to do for me. And so when they're looking at these candidates, it's really like, how do I benefit this? Instead of what Chris said - thinking about 10 years from now, how this will affect us, we're thinking about how this is going to affect me right now. And right now, it feels good, because I got money in my pocket. But now, here we are three years later, and prices for gas and milk are $20. So we didn't think about how this would affect us later on. We just thought, oh, this feels good now.\n\nJoe Biden is 80 years old. He's running for re-election. I get that - I get the options of the choice. I'm saying, how do you feel about that?\n\nI don't know. Not \"I don't know.\" It makes me think about, if something were to happen, then who am I looking at as next in line? And so then, it's like, you know. So it brings it to reality, the role of the vice president -\n\nIt's a good question, y'all. Like -\n\nThe interesting thing for me is, I had this whole plan, right? I had this plan of, OK, Biden can beat Trump. Biden will run for one term. And then, Kamala would be next in line. And it didn't happen that way. Kamala didn't - Kamala didn't -\n\nKamala didn't.\n\nShe did. That's it. That's it.\n\nPeriod.\n\nEverything is this real uncomfortable laugh at the end of every statement, and it just - part of it - part of it is that she wasn't used correctly, and part of it is who she is.\n\nBut you thought Biden would be one term, and he was setting up the next generation.\n\n- setting up the next generation. I was not prepared for -\n\nTo be back here.\n\n- to be back here. I was not prepared for that.\n\n- almost like an impossible thought. We would never see Biden and Trump again.\n\nEver.\n\nThat just - we never -\n\nJust, we just kind of thought we needed Biden for that moment, that he was our best shot of beating Trump.\n\nSpecific to progressives, like, we think of the Bernies of the world. You think of national progressive leaders. They've really struggled to win over Black people. What is it about progressive politics that has somehow, at least at the top levels, not fully mixed with Black communities?\n\nI think because a lot of Black people are religious. And that's where a lot of -\n\nWhat do you mean? Say, be more specific. Like, what do you mean?\n\nOK, let's say women who want to have abortion. Progressive believes that that's what you can do. But there are a lot of Black people that don't believe - \"That's wrong. The Bible says that's wrong.\"\n\nBut you're taking away the power to choose. God didn't even do that to you. So for you to take away their power to choose, you're just as wrong as them. You're being God to them.\n\nYou know, we're in the same boat with this perspective, especially when you get to abortion. And it's like people are absolutely shocked to believe that I am saying that the woman should have a choice. Like, it's like can you be saved and say this? Absolutely.\n\nBecause to your point, Chris, we all have choice. Now, I'm not saying I believe in it. I'm not saying that I think it's right. But you got a choice to make.\n\nIf it's Trump versus Biden again, do you know how you would vote?\n\nIt's OK.\n\nSo, so how I will vote - right now, in this, I am very, very torn. I cannot vote for Trump - I cannot - and face tomorrow and wake up and feel like I'm a person, a human. I can't do that.\n\nBut also, voting for Biden - it also brings concern to my life as well. That's my thing.\n\nBiden.\n\nYeah, absolutely, Biden.\n\nI'm going with Biden. I'm with Chris. I cannot do Trump.\n\nI would go for Biden as well.\n\nI probably would not vote for either.\n\nOoh, you're not going to vote, sis?\n\nI don't want either one, so it's like -\n\nIt's worse not to vote at all.\n\nBut it's like, am I going to vote for someone who I absolutely don't want, and then vote for someone who I really don't want either?\n\nSo what's the alternative? [INTERPOSING VOICES]\n\nThey are, but it won't be because of me. [LAUGHS]\n\nBut let's - so it's going to be because of a plethora of youths.\n\nDo you feel like you're a Democrat more because of what Democrats do, or more because of what Republicans do?\n\nOoh.\n\nMore because of what Republicans do.\n\n[INTERPOSING VOICES]\n\nSomeone write that down.\n\nBut yeah, that's a good one. Probably more because of what Republicans do. And I don't line up with that.\n\nI would say because of what Democrats do.\n\nYeah.\n\nYeah.\n\nThat's the closest we'll get to pride.\n\nMore after the break.\n\nAt this point in the evening, the turkey was picked clean. People were loading up on Angelica's bounty of desserts. And at least in a typical year, it was the time of night when the board games would come out, or my mom would challenge me to a game of Parcheesi.\n\nBut this year, I was up to something. And before everyone left, I wanted to have two more discussions about Black voters in 2024 to explore another division that's clear in the polling data -\n\nSo we're doing a gender split as our last combo. So the men are going to stick around here, and then we're going to have Black women in the other room.\n\n- gender.\n\nWhile there's significant dropoff between young and old Black voters in terms of political engagement, what truly alarms national Democrats is the current trend line when it comes to Black men specifically. And that poll of battleground states 27 percent of Black men supported Donald Trump, an incredibly high number for a Republican primary candidate.\n\nAnd considering Trump's struggles with traditional swing voters like moderates and independents, his ability to appeal to groups that don't typically vote Republican, like Black men, matters a ton. So I wanted to gather the Black men in the house and have an honest discussion about what might be behind those numbers and whether they think they'll hold.\n\nHand-raise if you consider yourself a Democrat. So that's about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 out of the nine of us. Would you consider yourself a Republican? 1 - would you consider yourself an independent?\n\nI think depending on the issue.\n\nDepending on the issue. OK, so we got two. For you, Darrell, you said you're a Republican. Have you always been a Republican?\n\nAlways.\n\nWhat makes you a Republican? What made you a Republican?\n\nLike, generally, I think those things vary by state. For us, you know what I'm saying? Why would I vote against myself? And in my community, and where I'm from, the Republican Party does a lot for Black people and a lot for business.\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nIndiana.\n\nSo it's a state that has Republicans in power, has had Republicans in power for a long time. You're saying that leads you to be more interested in voting for Republicans.\n\nAbsolutely. Why would I vote against myself or vote against my interest?\n\nOne of the reasons we wanted to convene this group specifically is, when you look at polling data right now, there some fear among Democrats that this could be an election where there's a bigger dropoff among Black men specifically when it comes to Democrats. I'm curious, what do you think it is? What's the connection? Why are Black men more open to Republicans, do you think, than Black women?\n\nThe financial mobility. The Republican Party preaches somewhat of this concept of \"strap up your bootstraps\" and kind of will your own way and to make your own way as far as financially. The financial mobility that they say that's out there - I think that appeals to more men, and disenfranchised, that want to take another step financially within their community.\n\nSo you're telling me that I can be a businessowner and you can give me the steps to be there. I can be more efficient. I can have more economic wealth in my own community. That is appealing to some people. I think that's kind of a reason that might be appealing to them. Well, another thing is that I honestly feel that the Democratic Party has forgotten about the Black male.\n\nIn what way?\n\nWhat I mean by that is that one of the major demographics that we have is our African-American women. They're amazing. They're very strong. They come out to the polls.\n\nBut as African-American men, sometimes we get left. Like, our needs, our desires, our wants are not always in account. We kind of get pushed to the side. I think sometimes that might be something that men are looking at, that our needs are not being taken care of. Like, our matters are not being resolved.\n\nI mean, Democrats say, in nearly every speech now, Black women are the bedrocks of democracy, or there needs to be specific focus on them as the anchors of the party. I mean, I heard you say that you think that sometimes the downstream of that can feel like Black men are absent. Do the rest of you all feel like Black men are -\n\nWhy are we looking for the Democratic party or any kind of party to give you validation? Why do you need these - you a man, bro. If you want to feel a certain way or you want to do something in your community, if you want to make money, then you should do it.\n\n[INAUDIBLE] just want to be spoken to, though, right? Like, that's not unique to Black men. Right? That's not unique to one specific group. Voters want politicians to speak to those concerns.\n\nThat's what I'm saying. That's the point of being politicians. My job is to make money so that I could buy my way of what I want. I don't want to ask you or you to tell me what I think. I want to pay you to speak for what I think.\n\nYeah. Go ahead, Chris.\n\nI also wanted to tag on to a lot of Black men. Democrats do not cater to men, because the squeaky wheel get the oil. We don't talk often. We don't speak up. We don't say anything.\n\nWomen say - they - I'm a woman. I can't get this raise. They speak up. So of course, they're going to cater to who's going to speak up. And the number ratio towards women versus men is, who would you spend more of your money to cater towards? You're going to cater towards the women.\n\nThere's also been a big change in how the Democratic Party talks about gender and sexuality and other issues over the last five, six years, right? A MeToo movement has completely upended language around gender and gender roles. Embrace of LGBTQ rights, about transgender identity, has changed the way the party talks about certain issues. Do you think that has shifted the party's relationship with Black men?\n\nYes. It has. This reality of it, especially in inner cities - we have a lot of people that can't pull themselves up, whatever the circumstances are. So we have a lot of Black men that are essentially zombies in their neighborhoods. And so with a lack of wisdom or knowledge to get to that point, they're not even in the picture.\n\nAnd then, some that are in the picture - they feel that they're left out, because the reality of it is when you look at the homosexual movement or LGBTQ or however you want to put it, the reality of it is, they get more equity than Black men in some cases. But part of that is because of the movement that they have and that base. And so their base make noise.\n\nAnd so if we collectively got together perhaps, we can make that noise. But unfortunately, sometimes we can't get together for whatever reason. You know, it's like 10 churches on one street in the same neighborhood. And collectively, we can't work together to do God's mission.\n\nYou know, I think the zombie point is interesting. That makes me think about, obviously, joblessness, criminal justice. If there was a specific issue that you think matters most to Black men, what would you think that is? It's a mass generalization, I know.\n\nTrust me, I know. What I'm saying is, if we could think, what would you think about if there was an issue that someone could speak to that you think would resonate?\n\nEconomic empowerment would be one of the primary things, but also spiritual enlightenment. And when I say that, I'm speaking specifically to coming to a knowledge of who we are, what our design is based upon the biblical understanding of truth and manhood. Because manhood - I do think we have to fight for manhood.\n\nBecause it's being pulled away and redefined by all these different groups. And I do believe that Black men, we have to take our voice back and not be passive, and be more deliberate - and particularly Christian Black men - being very deliberate about discipleship, but also economic empowerment. I think those two things are critical for us.\n\nWell, let me ask then about the current figures. Right? One about Trump and specific to his appeal, or lack of appeal, maybe, to Black men. But Trump is someone who has done more outreach to Black men specifically, whether that be First Step Act and kind of criminal justice reform openness, whether that be hitting up every rapper who's ever lived.\n\nBut I mean, the man talks more explicitly about Black men than any Republican I've ever known.\n\nAnd he's getting a response for it, too.\n\nDo you feel like that?\n\nA lot of stuff that a lot of Black men may be going towards Trump now is because what he said he did. His word was his bond. And that's a lot of men's value. What he said he would do - Obama ran because he was Black and saying all this Black stuff. But when he took office, oh, he can't do that no more.\n\nThis is spicy, Chris.\n\nHe's president. But you ran from that, and you got - you won because of that. But when you got there, you couldn't do that.\n\nSo what did he say that he was going to do that he actually - he did?\n\nWho?\n\nTrump, that didn't -\n\nBuild the wall.\n\nLike that's a good thing?\n\nNo, I ain't saying it was a good thing. That's not the point.\n\nIt's not actually about the value judgment of what he did. It's the fact that it's a person willing to do what they say they do.\n\nAnd I want to add just one more point. I want to add this one more point. Under Trump's administration, I found a whole lot of Black men starting businesses.\n\nYeah, but you understand that had nothing to do with Trump. That had nothing - that had nothing - that had nothing to do with Trump. But that's Republican - whenever there's a Republican in charge, they make it easy. They get rid of the regulations. That's always - it's always.\n\n[ARGUING]\n\nIt's just -\n\nYou got to give him the credit.\n\n- if Obama did -\n\nAbsolutely. Twice?\n\nNo.\n\nOnly the first time?\n\n(LAUGHING) We ain't voted yet, [INAUDIBLE] only the first time.\n\nDid you vote for him, George?\n\nNo.\n\nOne thing we haven't talked about is kind of wars, globally, that's kind of, in the last month, has really taken up a bunch of the space. And one of the ways it's really affecting domestic politics is Joe Biden is going to ask Congress for close to $100 billion for Ukraine for Israel. And a place that you see him having trouble kind of pitching that is among Black communities. Right?\n\nLike, that there is less support sometimes for that amount of money going abroad. Quickly, I'm curious - Black men and Black people have been a very domestic-focused electorate, right? How, with what is happening globally right now - how does that - does that impact the way you think about next year's election? And what do you think about the prospect of how much money America spends to countries abroad? Because people like Donald Trump are going to make that America First - that's going to be one of those arguments that he's laying out.\n\nIt should be.\n\nI agree. It should be.\n\n- the war is not abroad, not America First?\n\nThat's a fine answer. I can see you're saying. I'm saying - I'm saying -\n\nSo right now, you're talking about allocating hundreds of millions of dollars to Ukraine and Israel. And yet, you have all these folk coming across the border, and you go right there, right down the street to Chicago, where you have people in the police departments and all that.\n\nAnd unfortunately, sometimes our government, whether it's Democrat or Republican, we don't take care of home base. We have a lot of places how they can put those funds and help folk out, you know. But right now, the focus is over there. And I think you can do - you can multitask. Unfortunately, we're not.\n\nI encourage us to take the stance of the airlines. Put your mask on first, and then go and help somebody else put their mask on. Because here's the deal. If you don't put your - we will not survive.\n\nAnd we pay all this money to all these people. It's going to be $25 per [INAUDIBLE]. And who is that going to affect the most?\n\nWe don't create any -\n\nIt's going to affect Black people most.\n\nOK, let's get back to Biden, though.\n\nWhat's the word on Biden?\n\nHe's too old.\n\nAnd we talk about the negatives of Trump often, but we don't talk about the negatives of Biden. In a world of today's politics where most policies are written by think tanks and groups of people, Biden handwrote a policy that resulted in more Black people being locked up than ever in the history of America. I mean, just -\n\nFor Donald Trump to succeed next year, specifically when we talk about Black men, he basically needs, like, 1 out of 4, 25 percent of Black men who will vote, to vote for him. Do you think that's possible?\n\nYes.\n\nI'm hoping they lock him up.\n\nI'm not going to lie. I think the [INAUDIBLE] going to slide in there. [LAUGHS]\n\n- still be president from prison.\n\nYeah. I think he's going to be - I think it's doable, but I don't think he's going to get the ticket. I really don't.\n\nYes, I think he can get 25 percent.\n\n[INTERPOSING VOICES]\n\nFirst question - just work with me that he's the nominee. Just let's assume he's the nominee.\n\nYes, assuming -\n\nAssuming he's the nominee, do you think that Trump can win 1 out of 4 Black men?\n\nYes, there's two factors. One is the economic factor, in terms of him pushing for entrepreneurial and all those types of things. The other thing is that he's dealing with straight men. He's not pushing the gay agenda openly. And that's another elephant in the room when it comes to brothers, you know. And so he has two things working for him that will appeal to 1 out of 4.\n\nThat is the elephant in the room. Trump's ability to appeal to some Black male voters isn't just about Trump. It's also about masculinity itself and the ways that changing norms around gender and sexuality are reshaping the political landscape.\n\nEarlier in the week, I told my mom I wanted to focus on this in my conversations. And she pointed out that to only seek the perspective of Black men without talking to Black women would be a real oversight. And I agree, and not just because you should always listen to your mother.\n\nSo while I was speaking to the group of men in the dining room -\n\nI'm just going to be free-roaming with the mic, so I'm going to try to come up -\n\nMy colleague, Elisa, spoke to a group of about 15 Black women, including my mom and sisters, about their own political power -\n\nWe carry the weight of a lot. And politicians know it, right? That if we're voting, we're turning the tides. Oftentimes, we're that extra whatever percentage that will take that particular candidate over the top to win.\n\n- the way that responsibility can be a burden -\n\nAlthough men are still having a difficult time voting. Yeah. That, yeah. But we've come - it just seems like we're still fumbling, and not us fumbling, but the same issues are before us. And so Black women have had to shoulder that. And I don't think that we shoulder it like we're shouldering it. I just think we do it. We just do what we do. And that's all.\n\n- and their view on the question we've been asking everyone all night.\n\nWe're as particularly interested, too, in Black men who decide to vote for Trump. And I guess what do you all think is the appeal there? Do you get it? Do you - do you not get it? What do you think is the reason that they're -\n\nYou know, you have the Black men who makes it, who's the CEO, who's successful. And then, the things that Trump stands for financially benefits them. So then that's the Black man that's voting for Trump. The Black man that hasn't experienced -\n\nI don't think that's the only Black man that's voting for Trump at all.\n\nThat's one of them. You can go ahead.\n\nI think - so if you say uneducated, because uneducated - I think that's the thing. That's it, right? That when you think about the lived experience with women and men, there was a burdening. There was a shouldering that we had to do. But we got education, right?\n\nWe - also think once we talk about the fairness of this country, in my approximation, I think that the problem is, we believed the gendered lie that a man would be up here and that women do what they do. And I think that maybe we propped up the belief that as a man, you would have certain advantages, maybe, and that hasn't happened for Black men.\n\nAnd I do think that it's created a question of, what do I do in this moment? And you know, Trump is very demonstrative against women in a way that affirms manhood, right? And so again, if you're feeling like you're discarded and nothing's working for you, that's going to appeal that language, right? It's really going to appeal to you.\n\nBut I think the more insidious part of it is that, you know, I think it really is the juxtaposition of the life. Like, you women had it. You're making money. You're doing all things that I could never do. Right?\n\nAnd so I know that on the higher end, but I think when anyone white or Black makes money, they want that tax break. I have not met a CEO who don't want a tax break. Right?\n\nSo I don't know if we could just put it on just Black men who make money. But I think that when you mitigate and talk about - take away education, take away just privileges, and that's working, right? Those are things that we're able to do as women in a way that just hasn't happened in an equitable sense, right? So it's literally the competition of things.\n\nAnd I think - I think Black men, when we - Black mothers - we maybe gave wrong lessons to the children. Because I think it's this idea that I was - as a man, I was supposed to have this. This is what I was owed. This is what I was due.\n\nIs that what your mother told you?\n\nOne of the things that you'll hear him say all the time, him being Trump, is even if he has all his different litigation issues, he'll say they're coming after me. And they're coming - no, and not just that they will. By way of coming after me, they are coming after you. When they attack me, they're attacking you.\n\nThat definitely maybe pulls on the desires of becoming for some Black men. And if this man is saying, this powerful man is saying, I've got you, I understand that they have not been there for you, and I - and you see how they're attacking me, that's how they're attacking you, and I'm going to stop them from attacking me. And that'll also stop them from attacking you. I'm always scared to say it, but less educated, but if you are not astute, if you're not educating yourself, then what he says becomes golden.\n\nYeah. I think even just on a simpler level, like, when he ran on make America great again, I think not just on race and gender, that whole slogan to me was almost like, people wanting to get their, like, so-called power back. And so then, as a Black woman, it's like, race-wise, what do you mean make America great again? Like, what time period are you talking about? Because in the '50s, I don't want to go - for me.\n\nAnd then, even for men, like you were saying, like, we now have done so much. And so like, if you are the man who's like, actually, I thought I supposed to be in a different place, and I see my woman counterpart, I'm trying to make America great again to reverse the tide and get my power back.\n\nSo I hear, like, that it seems like, in this case, why you see Black men voting for Trump is that it comes from a place of self-interest, of wanting to - from your perspective, and choosing the thing that they think is going to best benefit them. I guess I'm wondering who you all see as the strongest advocates for Black women.\n\nFor Black women?\n\nNo one.\n\nRight.\n\nOurselves! We are our greatest advocates.\n\nBlack women are advocates for themselves.\n\n[INTERPOSING VOICES]\n\nBecause we talked about, like - I'm going to butcher her name - Kamala. We talked about her, and I think people thought something more of her, and I don't - I don't know if Black women saw that with her. I don't have the answer to that. But I wonder, like, when we talk about that, if we saw her, like, in this.\n\n- because she had that pearls and gym shoes thing, and you saw all women from sororities coming together with their pearls in their chucks. And they were like, oh, we've got someone that looks like us in there again, and they were hoping - like we said with Obama, they were expecting her to do so much.\n\nAnd we've seen nothing. And so now, it's like, who speaks for us? I think people were thinking that she would be it. And that's why we voted. So I honestly think she helped him pull that thing.\n\nBecause there was no way without it. And so now that we don't have what we expected, it's kind of like, OK, well, there goes that. What's next?\n\nYeah.\n\nWell, I think that when we talk about men, whether Black or white, I think that the thought of Kamala Harris being the president, it's easy to see why it's - that Black men could be going towards Trump.\n\nYeah.\n\nBecause the thought, even when we deal with Biden and his age, and the thought is, OK, if something does happen, then this is going to be our president. I think that thought will drive many men, Black or white.\n\nAt this point, I walked over from the dining room to listen to what was being said. I also wanted to know what they thought of the question I posed to the group of men.\n\nSo next year, and next year, for Trump to basically achieve his Black male goals, he needs to win 1 out of 4.\n\nOh.\n\nReally?\n\n1 out of 4 - if he wins 25 percent to 30 percent of Black men, it'll be the highest rate of any Republican in modern history. Do you think he could win 1 out of 4 Black men?\n\nYes.\n\nYes, at this moment.\n\nYes. We have a lot of praying to do.\n\n[INDISTINCT CONVERSATION]\n\nSoon after that conversation, we ended the night. People started grabbing leftovers, packing them in tinfoil, and saying goodbye, with laughter and hugs. I hadn't seen some of these people in a long time.\n\nAnd over the next couple of days, I heard from several of them, who told me that they felt grateful to be part of the experience. I felt thankful for them, their willingness to play ball with my questions, their candor, for celebrating my favorite holiday a little early.\n\nI was saying, can you take us through this? Take us through what you made.\n\nOh, my goodness.\n\nAnd of course, for giving Angelica an excuse -\n\nI have Christmas pinwheel, coconut macaroons -\n\n- to bake 13 different desserts.\n\n- fruit-filled shortbread, regular shortbread, pumpkin macaroons, cinnamon shortbread, lemon poppy seed shortbread, pound cake ginger molasses cookies, chocolate chip cookies, Oreo cheesecake, which is going to be like the triumph, and pecan brittle. Did I say walnut brownie?\n\nNo.\n\nOK. [LAUGHS]\n\nJust something slight. You know?\n\nThat's \"The Run-Up\" for Thursday, November 23, 2023. And now, the run-down -\n\n[APPLAUSE]\n\nSo this is how you guys get to play - is if you like something, go ahead. You applaud. All that. We do not boo here. We do not boo. If you don't like something, let the silence do a heavy lifting. OK?\n\nLast Friday in Des Moines, Ron DeSantis, Nikki Haley, and Vivek Ramaswamy pitched themselves to evangelicals - an important voting bloc in the upcoming Iowa caucus.\n\nSo beyond the talking points, is there a conviction moment for any of you or each of you about, this is what drove my commitment to the sanctity of human life?\n\nHosted by the family leader, a prominent evangelical organization, the GOP presidential hopefuls all set together and answered personal questions about family, marriage, and abortion.\n\nWe did invite the former President to be here as well. And it's OK. You guys know how that goes with Thanksgiving, right? Sometimes some guests don't show up. So -\n\nDonald Trump, who holds a near 50-point lead in the polls, did not attend. On Monday, Joe Biden, already the oldest sitting US president, celebrated his 81st birthday.\n\nAnd finally, to bake all of her desserts, my sister Angelica used 26 sticks of butter and 30 eggs. There are seven weeks in four days until the Iowa caucuses and 348 days until the general election.\n\nWe'll see you next week.\n\n\"The Run-Up\" is reported by me, Astead Herndon, and produced by Elisa Gutierrez, Caitlin O'Keefe, and Anna Foley.

That's just the bottom line. And Republicans are for the rich people.\"\n\nPashal Mabry\n\n\"We vote because that's what we're supposed to do. But then when you see the numbers, it's almost disheartening. It's like we're once again like the bedrock having to put the weight on, and I want everybody to do it.\"\n\nShanell Bowden\n\nMr. Trump carried 8 percent of the Black vote in 2020.\n\nIt is just one poll, of course, but it follows the 2022 midterm elections, in which turnout among Black voters was one of the weakest points for the Democrats.\n\n\"I feel like the Democratic Party needs to train young people, educate them on this whole process.

We're not afraid to learn.\"\n\nChristopher Hodges\n\n\"Unfortunately, sometimes our government, whether it's Democrat or Republican, we don't take care of home base.\"\n\nReginald Robinson\n\nSo what is really going on? How worried should Democrats be about the erosion of support among Black voters?\n\n\"The Run-Up\" is in a particularly good position to try and answer those questions. We convened a focus group - a very special, one-time only focus group in the childhood home of Astead W. Herndon, who hosts \"The Run-Up.\"\n\nFor the wide-ranging discussion, he gathered family members, parishioners from his father's church, community members and people he grew up with, all of whom largely leaned Democratic, but were clear about the ways in which the party had let them down.\n\nThe conversations were anchored in questions about Black voters and the Democratic Party, but also covered the apparent appeal of Mr. Trump to Black men specifically.\n\nIt was a special focus group in another way, too.

      "text": "Black Men Are Waiting for a Democratic Party That Delivers for Them\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nGuest Essay\n\nBy Charles Coleman Jr.\n\nMr. Coleman is a civil rights lawyer, a former prosecutor and a co-host of the MSNBC special \"Black Men in America: The Road to 2024.\"\n\nBlack men today face a unique reality that warrants consideration: Under nearly any relevant index for measuring the quality of American life - how far we get in school , our finances when compared with those of our white counterparts, and how long we will live - Black men consistently rank last or near last. There is not a Black man alive in this country right now who has ever seen Black male unemployment equal to or less than that of his white counterparts.\n\nThis is true even more acutely for a 34-year-old Black man born in 1990 who may have voted in every presidential election since his 18th birthday, saw the election of a Black president and spent more of his adult life with Democrats in the Oval Office than Republicans.\n\nHow could we not be asking ourselves: Come November, which candidate can help us change course?\n\nHistory might suggest that Kamala Harris's campaign for commander in chief would be met with near unflinching support from much of the Democratic faithful - women, Black, Latino and college-educated voters . Pew Center data estimates that from 1994 through 2019, both Black and Latino registered voters have consistently identified as Democrats at rates higher than white voters. Yet in a moment where political allegiances of the past would seem to carry the day, Democrats are increasingly challenged in maintaining their stronghold among Black male voters.\n\nBlack men's reconsideration of the Democratic Party is the worst kept secret of the progressive left. Black voters who aren't Democrats still may be a small minority, but with the speed and reach of the internet these voices are increasingly amplified at levels exceeding what many ever thought was possible. Regardless of the outcome of the November election, Democrats cannot afford to dismiss this as tomorrow's problem. The margin for victory will be tight on either side, and even in a world where Ms. Harris is victorious, this issue is not going away or shrinking in its significance.\n\nIn many respects, Democrats have themselves to blame for this disturbing trend by not controlling what has been in their power to control. While Republicans seemed to ignore the Black vote entirely, Democrats failed to prioritize policies that would have spoken directly to Black voters.\n\nFor example, there is no reason that the expiring portions of the Voting Rights Act should have been left to the Supreme Court to begin gutting with Shelby County v. Holder when Democratic legislators had decades to codify many of its tenets. Likewise, a commitment to police reform would have meant that once the George Floyd police reform act died in Senate committee because of Republican stonewalling, Democrats should have remained dogged in their pursuit of these much-needed changes to police conduct.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Trump take the stage in Atlanta on Thursday, their battle to engage Black voters has reached a fever pitch.\n\nSurrogates, officials and organizers from both parties held a flurry of events in Atlanta barbershops, community centers and labor halls this week, using the backdrop of the early matchup between the two presidential candidates to encourage a crucial voting bloc in the heart of a key battleground state to turn back out in November.\n\nTheir efforts come as Black voters, long considered Democrats' most loyal constituency, have voiced increasing frustrations with Mr. Biden and his party over the last several months. Some Black voters have suggested that they would support Mr. Trump in November or not vote at all.\n\nBut even as the Trump campaign aims to take advantage of the bloc's softening support for Mr. Biden, it faces challenges in growing its grass-roots Black support and embracing policy positions that are popular with a broad enough swath of Black voters, particularly those who have supported Democrats in the past. Some of the challenges that the G.O.P. faces in fracturing Mr. Biden's coalition were on display at these events.\n\nA Republican-led discussion at a Black-owned barbershop on Wednesday in Atlanta quickly devolved as panelists vacillated among obscure policy suggestions, cultural grievances and at times ahistoric conjectures about Black Americans. One panelist referred to the trans-Atlantic slave trade as an \"experience\" and said that older generations of Black voters have generated \"narratives that were divisive.\"\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Jelani Cobb , a New Yorker staff writer and historian, points out that the four Democratic front-runners, all of whom are white, may struggle to get the turnout they need. Cobb tells David Remnick that Joe Biden 's strong lead may begin to fall after his weak showing among largely white voters in Iowa; Pete Buttigieg has very low support among South Carolina voters, and even faces opposition from black constituents in his home town of South Bend, Indiana. But Bernie Sanders , Cobb says, seems to have made inroads with younger black voters, at least, since 2016.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "How Democratic Candidates Win the African-American Vote\n\nSouth Carolina will be the third state to vote for a Democratic nominee in 2020, but the first with a largely black electorate-more than sixty per cent of primary voters there are expected to be African-American. On Monday, Quinnipiac University released a poll of the state, which matched other polls released this year. Joe Biden held a large lead over all; Elizabeth Warren , considered the other front-runner, was at eight per cent among black voters; and Pete Buttigieg , the mayor of South Bend, who was bolted into a lead in Iowa, registered zero per cent of the black vote. The split, which has been replicated in other polls, shows the degree to which Democratic candidates other than Biden have struggled to appeal to African-American voters-who, for decades, have been the Party's most loyal constituency. (Last week, Deval Patrick, the former governor of Massachusetts, became the third black candidate to join the field, after Senators Kamala Harris and Cory Booker , neither of whom has broken through with black voters.)\n\nTo discuss the role of black voters in the Democratic Party, I recently spoke by phone with Fredrick Harris, a professor of political science at Columbia University, who has written extensively about African-American politics. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed the roots of Buttigieg's struggles with black voters, the meaning of a Democratic field without many Southern candidates, and what Obama's legacy means for black Presidential candidates going forward.\n\nThere has been a lot of discussion about how older African-American voters have shown a preference for Joe Biden and younger African-American voters are more up for grabs. Do you think the candidates are or are not competing for African-American voters in this primary in similar ways to the past several Democratic primaries?\n\nThere have been candidates who have been competing for the African-American vote. They just haven't been successful. You have to keep in mind there are two black candidates that are still not quite dead, particularly Senator Harris. And I think she tried to use some of the same tropes and the same strategy as Barack Obama did in 2008, but it's not sticking. So, if you take out the black candidates who are not viable, I think there are candidates who have been trying to cultivate the black vote. Elizabeth Warren has. She's been going to South Carolina. She's been holding meetings with groups of African-American voters. And so, in fact, I think it's a good thing that the black vote is not concentrated around one particular candidate.\n\nWhy do you think the Harris and Booker campaigns haven't really succeeded this far?\n\nThis relates maybe more to Harris than Booker, but this point I'm about to make applies to both. I think the anti-Trump sentiment is so strong among African-Americans that they're really thinking pragmatically, and that pragmatism has got them to be far more supportive of Biden than they probably would be in a previous election. There is the obvious reason that he was Obama's Vice-President and, at least in the polls, is the candidate who consistently seems that he can beat Trump. And so they're pushing aside, for a moment, the case of Senator Booker and Senator Harris.\n\nThe other thing is that-how can I put this-there is a core of black voters who are just not going for the okey-doke again. And what I mean is that this idea of having some sort of symbolic black Presidency has been done, and so they're asking hard questions about policy. What has been their record around issues that are important to them? I think, for Senator Harris, it's been the current hard criminal-justice record that's in many ways tripped her up, in addition to her not being very clear on some positions and going back and forth. We'll see what happens with Mayor Bloomberg, who only yesterday went before a congregation at a black church in Brooklyn and said, \"I'm sorry about my record on stop-and-frisk.\" We haven't heard any apology like that from Senator Harris on her record. She stood by it or she's kept silent on it.\n\nAnd so here we are, in the aftermath of the Black Lives Matter movement, where criminal-justice reform is a very important, salient issue among many black voters. And the black woman candidate doesn't have a record that reflects the reform that's needed. So, again, the thing is pragmatism and beating Trump, and the second thing with Senator Harris is her record on reform. For Booker, I suspect some sort of message of all of us coming together-this Martin Luther King-esque view about the need for black, white, and all people to come together for the common good-just doesn't fit well in this moment that we are in in American history.\n\nI know you've written critically about the Obama Presidency, or what the Obama years actually delivered for people of color. It seems like what you're saying is that even though there is this immense respect for Obama, there is also this idea that voting for an African-American candidate just because they're African-American, if they're not going to deliver on certain things, is kind of-\n\nIn the past, I think. It is a thing of the past, at least at this moment. We're not that far away from President Obama's two terms, and there are people who have seen that the only racial and ethnic group that has not rebounded from the Great Recession, particularly in terms of net worth, have been African-Americans, and this occurred under a so-called black Presidency. So, because of that, I think people are asking harder questions about policy issues.\n\nJust to go back to Biden, do you see the support that he's getting from African-Americans, especially the ones over fifty, as being as much about pragmatism as it is about warm feelings toward him for serving as Obama's Vice-President for eight years?\n\nI think it's a combination. He wouldn't have been a viable candidate, I don't think, in 2016. I really do think that it's because he seems to be the person who can beat Trump. And it helps, too, that he worked in Obama's Administration. At least, those are the anecdotal things I hear among older black voters. I'm trying to think back about other Democratic primaries. People have forgotten that Bill Clinton was thought to be the first black President. And I could hear people say, including some of my relatives in Georgia, \"Wouldn't it be great to see Bill Clinton back in the White House by voting for Hillary?\" And then Barack Obama rose up.\n\nBut you have to remember he only saw the black vote coalesce around him after his victory in Iowa. Before then, he didn't have the majority of the black vote. African-Americans are the most loyal constituency in the Democratic Party; they're more Democratic than any other racial or ethnic group in the country. And so that loyalty informs the way they think about political candidates. And, when I speak here about that loyalty, I'm thinking of middle-aged and older African-American voters. And so, because of that, I think their political preferences tend to be pretty pragmatic. And I think that's been historical.\n\nI think that fits a little bit into what you're saying about 2008, because once Obama won in Iowa and in all these states, it was sort of like, \"Oh, maybe this guy actually is the pragmatic choice, too.\"\n\nOnce Obama got-how can I put this-validation from white voters, black voters felt comfortable in switching from Hillary to Obama. Which means then that if, by some chance, Kamala Harris or even Booker wins in Iowa, then you may see shifting there. But, even then, I still suspect people are going to be raising issues about their records.\n\nFor how long has it been assumed that African-Americans would deliver votes for the people considered the more pragmatic or even establishment part of the Party?\n\nThe late political scientist Hanes Walton wrote series of books where he made an argument about white Southerners who were Democrats, like Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton, and even L.B.J. in 1964-that black voters, half of the Democratic electorate or more in the South, felt much more a sense of kinship with those white candidates. And they tended to support those candidates in primary elections. So Jimmy Carter wasn't necessarily the establishment candidate, nor was Bill Clinton in 1992, but they did very well with black voters. Carter got the endorsement of Coretta Scott King, Andrew Young, the civil-rights élites in Atlanta. John Edwards won in South Carolina in 2004, too. So there's that argument, the native-son-candidacy theory of black voting behavior.\n\nWhy do you think that is? Is it that Jimmy Carter or Bill Clinton has a pragmatic streak, or are from states with large African-American populations and have shown they can win white voters, too?\n\nIt's pragmatic. It's also the \"candidates that we know\" sort of thing. It goes back to what V. O. Key, who, in his famous book on Southern politics, referred to as \"friends and neighbors.\" I mean, I know Barack Obama is a great orator, but, even to this day, I cannot think of any President who could speak with the comfort of Bill Clinton in some Baptist church in the South or even outside of the South. He had a personal connection to a lot of black voters.\n\nThere was a book, a year or two after Clinton's Presidency, \" Bill Clinton and Black America ,\" with these interesting anecdotes about why black people felt that Bill Clinton was the first black President. It's because of this cultural connection they felt they had with him. He ate the same food that we did, listened to the same music. He knew us. He embraced us. And, in fact, some even said that the reason why the Republicans were going after Bill Clinton is because he liked or embraced African-Americans so much. Jimmy Carter had some conservative policies that rankled black leaders at the time. But there was this sense that he very much had a cultural connection, and particularly there was this religious evangelicalism that would also be familiar and appeal to black voters.\n\nThe qualities you're describing don't really fit any of the candidates that we have in the race now, black or white.\n\nThat may be part of the problem.\n\nI guess one reason for that is there are so few Democratic governors in the South, although I know one just did win in Louisiana. It would seem to suggest a problem for Democrats, in the sense that the candidates who could really inspire black voters may not be the types that are going to win the nomination of a Party that is much more Northern, much more liberal. It's a different profile than what you're talking about.\n\nYeah. It is a different profile of candidate. And I would even argue that the reason why Obama was able to craft that in 2008, particularly in South Carolina, was not just by the force of his personality but because of Michelle Obama, who had the roots from the South Side of Chicago to the American South, and went before black women voters there particularly to say to them, \"I understand your fear of voting for black candidates.\" She tapped into their anxiety-she knew the language. She was a Southern surrogate from the South Side of Chicago.\n\nIf you look at polls, Warren has some support among African-American voters under forty-five or so, but it's still pretty low. Buttigieg is getting zero per cent among black voters in various polls. Beyond what you're saying about the type of candidates that historically have appealed more to African-American voters, do you have some sense about why these two candidates specifically might be struggling with black voters?\n\nFor the same reason why Kerry and the same reason why Bernie struggled last time and is struggling now. They don't know them. They don't have any reference point or a cultural connection like with the type of candidate I talked about in the past. The black vote is still rooted in the South. There are candidates who are not on the circuit at the N.A.A.C.P. national conventions, or attending this Congressional Black Caucus weekend or speaking regularly at a Baptist church in Alabama and Mississippi. They just don't know these people. I mean \"don't know them\" in the sense that they don't have enough information to make sense about what their commitment really is to the African-American community. And, even though things are changing, I think it does go back to this \"friends and neighbors\" view of politics among black voters. It's a part of how you stand on political issues, but it is based on what your connections are to black communities prior to running for public office.\n\nIs there a way in which you think Sanders or Warren or Buttigieg, with more exposure, could have some potential upside or political strength with black voters?\n\nYou mean in the general election?\n\nYeah.\n\nEven though it didn't matter, black voters came out during the Reagan years, even though they were disappointed by the native-son candidacy of Jesse Jackson. They're going to come out because the animus against President Trump is so high that they will vote for any Democratic candidate in large numbers.\n\nI was wondering if you have any concern that turnout won't come close to matching what it did in the Obama years.\n\nIt won't. For the first time, black turnout surpassed white turnout in 2012. I do think it will depend on some degree of enthusiasm about the candidate. But I think the Party didn't do enough last time around to put money into mobilizing these voters. I think that was a crucial mistake by Senator Clinton. And so I think there are two sides to this: how motivated people are going to be, and what kind of resources the Party's going to put in place in order to get these voters out to vote.\n\nStacey Abrams as a Vice-Presidential candidate-that's a part of the equation, too, that we haven't discussed. I think the Vice-Presidential candidate is going to be an important factor, because if it's a person like Stacey Abrams-who does have the \"friends and neighbors\" sensibility, who, after her loss in Georgia, has become a national celebrity in the Democratic Party and loved by many black voters-that could make the difference.\n\nAfrican-Americans Democrats are, according to polls, more skeptical of gay marriage than other Democratic constituencies, and there has been some speculation that that could be hurting Pete Buttigieg. Do you give credence to that, and do you think that will be somewhat of a problem for him winning over black voters either at some point in the primary or later in the general election?\n\nI think with Buttigieg the problem is that black voters don't know him. To me, he's just like Warren and Bernie in the sense that they just don't know who he is. And the thing is, you're absolutely right, black voters, particularly those who are regular churchgoers, tend to be opposed to gay marriage and supportive of other conservative, values-oriented beliefs. But the economic factors or civil-rights issues always trump those social issues. And so the thing about that is that if it's a candidate who's viable, who speaks to the interests and needs of the black community . . . For instance, if Buttigieg had a record in South Bend that was more positive to black voters, perhaps he would get a different response. He doesn't have the social ties to those communities.\n\nIt seems like what you're saying is that, if a candidate who did have these social ties and was speaking to the community was gay, you don't think it would then be a particular political problem.\n\nNot on a national level. If there was a candidate for governor of Mississippi, certainly it would be. So, yeah, context means a lot here. They didn't punish Obama because he was supportive of gay-rights issues, right? There was no mass exodus.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "A Florida Demographic That Could Swing the Election\n\nToward the end of the 2016 Presidential campaign, a political canvasser working in the predominantly Black community of Newtown, in Sarasota, Florida, engaged a young man in conversation. \"Why should I register to vote?\" the man said. \"Ain't nothing happened for me in the past eight years.\" Barack Obama's two terms were followed by a historic decline in voter turnout among Black people, and Donald Trump carried Florida by 112,911 votes.\n\nFast-forward to 2020, on a Sunday afternoon in Newtown, where Biden/Harris signs dotted the porches of small cinder-block houses. Five men sat on a bench, their casual demeanor betraying no awareness that they are viewed as a key variable in the election, and are a demographic that Trump is courting, with claims that he's making the criminal-justice system more equitable.\n\nThe men on the bench all served time in prison. One of them, heavyset, with an armful of tattoos, did twenty-nine years. He had voted early, and would say only that he had not voted for Trump: \"The way he talked to people, the way he talked to the news representatives, when he talks to Blacks . . .\" His buddies nodded. \"But, if he loses, it won't be because Biden was better, but because they don't like Trump.\"\n\nConvicted felons in Florida who have completed their sentences can vote, under the state's Amendment 4, but only after five to seven years and the payment of all back fines.\n\nA recent Hill-Harris poll of Florida voters found that thirteen per cent of Black respondents planned to vote for Trump. (In 2016, Trump won only eight per cent of the Black vote in Florida, according to an exit poll conducted by NBC.) The President's gains among Black voters can likely be attributed specifically to Black men. In September, a Nationscape survey of likely voters found that, although at least eighty-seven per cent of Black women planned to vote for Biden, only seventy-six per cent of Black men planned to do so. (According to Gallup, Trump's approval rating among Black men is also eight points higher than it is among Black women.) Jim Messina, who ran President Obama's reëlection campaign, told this magazine, last week, \"If Biden can win Florida early on Election Night, it's over.\"\n\nA few blocks away, a dreadlocked man in his thirties was tidying up a sidewalk café that he owns. He hasn't been out of prison long enough to be able to vote, but he said he wouldn't vote even if he could. He has views, though. \"I like Donald Trump,\" he said. \"He is now pushing people with power out. Like Jeffrey Epstein.\" He didn't elaborate on how he believed Epstein had been brought to justice. He thinks that Trump is being unfairly criticized about his taxes. \"He paid some money, something like seven hundred and fifty dollars,\" he said. \"He was a businessman, and, when you learn about business, you learn about what not to do.\" He went on, \"I mean, the Amazon guy didn't pay nothing, and he made billions.\"\n\nSeveral doors down, another man was working on some electrical wiring at a landmark house. He also has not been out of prison long enough to be able to vote, but he said that, if he could, he wouldn't choose Trump. About the Democratic candidates, he said, \"They should be reversed. Harris on the top.\"\n\nOver at the Salvation Army Center for Worship, a man named John Battle was taking a break from a service. Inside, several dozen other people, mostly former addicts and men who had been incarcerated, sat close together, without masks. Brought up in orphanages, Battle was a football star in high school, but in his twenties he ended up on the streets, and then in prison. Now forty-six, he has been out for only a few months, so he can't vote, either. Among his friends, he said, \"a lot like Donald Trump because he is straightforward. They believe the other guy is about raising taxes and taking away Social Security, and a lot of them are on it, and a lot get disability.\"\n\nAs for the way the government treats Black people, he said, \"They are always putting a 'pause' on things. Even with the stimulus. I got out on May 7th and filed for it, and I was told because I was in prison I can't get it yet. And white guys I know filed in June and July and immediately got their checks. And when I called I was told, 'There is nothing we can do.' \"\n\nEdward James III is a thirty-year-old community organizer and teacher at the Visible Men Academy, a school near Sarasota for Black and Hispanic boys, many with fathers who are incarcerated. He is unhappy that so few of the Black men he talks to are supporting Biden. \"I do understand where people are coming from when they say their lives had not changed under President Obama,\" he said. \"If you've been caught in a cycle of generational poverty and you've never really been anywhere. You're still poor. You're still having run-ins with the police. You're still seeing violence. You're still seeing death. You're still seeing drugs, right?\" He went on, \"If your everyday life is focussed on: How do I keep my lights on? How do I send money to my brother in prison? How do I make sure my daughter is not sexually assaulted by the man down the street? You're not thinking about things at the federal level. I get where they're coming from, but it's very misguided.\"\n\nTrump, he continued, is \"preying on Black people the same way he preys on poor, uneducated white people. He preys on their racism and tries to get them to vote against their own interests. Now, I haven't heard many Black men say they're voting for President Trump, but I will say there's not that much excitement for Biden.\" For some, he said, \"I think he's just flat-out uninspiring. A lot of people put their trust and dreams in Obama, and their lives have not changed.\" He got a dreamy look in his eyes. \"But still-Barack Obama! Once you've had filet mignon, everything else is like chopped liver.\" ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Clinton, Sanders, and the Myth of a Monolithic \"Black Vote\"\n\nMany believe that Bernie Sanders will lose the Democratic primary to Hillary Clinton in part because he cannot galvanize \"the black vote.\" Writing for The Nation on February 28th, Joan Walsh declared, \"When the history of the 2016 presidential primary is written, if Hillary Clinton is the party's nominee, it will show that Senator Bernie Sanders's campaign effectively ended in South Carolina.\" Why? Because Clinton learned, from 2008, to treat the state \"as a proxy for the black Democratic primary vote.\" That year, after she lost the state badly to Barack Obama, \"her campaign hemorrhaged African-American support\" and never recovered. This year, Walsh posits, that is more or less Sanders's problem.\n\nSanders's struggle with black voters in the state came into clear focus at a meet-and-greet, on February 13th, with the Sanders supporter Erica Garner-the twenty-five-year-old daughter of Eric Garner, who died after being choked by a police officer-at Jackie's, a soul-food restaurant in one of North Charleston's black neighborhoods. I arrived before Garner and found fifteen Sanders supporters, nearly all of whom were white, chatting animatedly among themselves and picking at Jackie's famous macaroni and cheese. Black customers who walked past the table on their way to the ordering counter cocked their heads and furrowed their brows in confusion-what were all these white people doing here? The intention of the gathering, surely, was to drum up support in the black community for Sanders, but the scene turned out to be a bleak harbinger of primary day-a giant win for Clinton that confirmed her long-established black support.\n\nWhen black men were enfranchised, in 1870, with the Fifteenth Amendment, the group became a voting bloc known as \"the negro vote,\" Vincent Hutchings, a political scientist at the University of Michigan, told me. Almost a century later, the term morphed into \"the black vote\" as the word \"negro\" became gauche in the country's liberal corners. The idea of the black vote persists among pundits, journalists, pollsters, and politically engaged dinner-party attendees to describe the electoral preferences of millions of voters. Once loyal to the party of Lincoln, blacks shifted their support almost completely to the Democratic Party with the passage of the Civil Rights Act, in 1964. But if you look at state-by-state numbers for this year's Democratic contest, \"the black vote\" appears more complicated. So far, Sanders has not won a majority of black voters in any contest with a large African-American population. But he has done much better with black voters in Midwestern states and with younger black voters across the country. These variances are one reason to start to unravel the myth of a monolithic black vote.\n\nIn the South, black voters overwhelmingly went for Clinton, but it's also the case that voters of every race cast more ballots for Clinton than they did for Sanders. In South Carolina , Clinton won eighty-six per cent of the black vote and fifty-four per cent of the white vote. In Georgia , she nabbed eighty-five per cent of the black vote and fifty-eight per cent of the white vote. \"Clinton just did better in the South,\" Harry Enten, a political writer and analyst for FiveThirtyEight, said. One reason why her black support may have been particularly strong in the region is that partisan politics in the South have a strong racial element. Hutchings noted that, in general, \"black people and white people in the South have never belonged to the same political party since emancipation.\" Before 1948, to the extent that blacks were able to vote, they largely voted Republican, and whites voted Democratic. When Democrats shifted to embrace civil rights after the Second World War, Southern whites briefly broke away from the Party to form the short-lived segregationist Dixiecrats. \"Because of sharp racial divisions in the South-sharper than they are in the Midwest-blacks have a firm recognition that the Democratic Party is identified with their group, just as whites do with the Republican Party,\" Hutchings said. Blacks in the South may have a harder time supporting an avowed socialist from Vermont, who only recently embraced the Democratic Party, in part because their identification with the Party brand historically has reigned supreme.\n\nThe Midwestern Democratic Party of the early twentieth century was \"less wedded to segregationist sentiments,\" Hutchings said, simply because \"there were far fewer blacks in this region.\" This may mean that, to this day, Northern black voters are more flexible in their allegiances. Sanders has won the white vote in almost every Midwestern state, and he has also won a larger share of black voters there than in the South: about thirty per cent in Illinois, Michigan, and Ohio. \"It's my sisters and brothers who have had their manufacturing jobs taken and pensions cut, who have a perpetual cycle of low wages,\" Nina Turner, a former Ohio state senator and Sanders supporter, said of the black Midwesterners who have been voting for Sanders. \"I heard it from the white middle class, too,\" who have also been living through the decline of the steel and auto industries, Turner added. \"A white working-class man has the same concerns as a black working-class man.\"\n\nGeography is not the only variable peeling away \"the black vote.\" As of March, forty-three per cent of black Democratic voters under the age of thirty had supported Sanders in this election cycle, according to Leah Wright Rigueur, a professor of public policy at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, who wrote for the Times about the significance of this faction. \"There's a group of young black men and women for whom Bernie Sanders's message of inequality resonated,\" Rigueur wrote. \"They were willing to excuse his clumsiness on matters of race because of his more radical assessment of American political power.\" Rigueur's argument on young black support for Sanders echoes Turner's on Midwestern black support for him.\n\nUltimately, the idea of a black vote is getting in the way of a more accurate understanding of where significantly different segments of the population are headed, and obscuring what black people have long known: that black identity is always malleable, and can be fractured as well. While Erica Garner may have failed to convince large numbers of black voters in South Carolina, Turner, a black native daughter of the Midwest, was part of a successful effort to rally many to the candidate in Michigan. The black political establishment, while still a juggernaut, is slowly being challenged. It happened with Barack Obama, who ran for President in 2008 with, at first, little black-establishment support. And it has happened again, to a lesser extent, in 2016, with a Jewish socialist from Vermont.\n\nFor Turner, Sanders's appeal to Midwestern voters crystallized at a forum on racial justice last month, at the Olivet Institutional Baptist Church, in Cleveland. \"That was the largest concentration of African-Americans he spoke to,\" she told me over the phone, unable to contain the excitement in her voice. \"He was able to say, 'I was arrested as a twenty-one-year-old at the University of Chicago.' And 'I was probably the only candidate in this race arrested for civil rights.' You heard the 'Amens' and 'You better preach, Mr. Sanders.' \"\n\nClinton, for one, has not been taking the support of black voters for granted in the next major primary contest. On Tuesday, the former New York senator visited Medgar Evers College, a predominantly black school in Crown Heights, Brooklyn. She was flanked by black women, among them Chirlane McCray, the First Lady of New York City, who said, \"Hillary does not just talk the talk. She walks the walk, right? So who do we need? Hillary.\" If \"the black vote\" were guaranteed, Clinton wouldn't be wasting her time courting it.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "How Did the Democrats End Up Here?\n\nEarly in last week's Democratic Presidential debate, in Las Vegas, just before it began to seem as if Michael Bloomberg 's cutman might rush onto the stage during a commercial break, carrying a spit bucket and an ice pack, the former mayor of New York made an observation about the candidates. \"If we took off this panel everybody that was wrong on criminal justice sometime in their careers,\" he said, \"there'd be nobody else up here.\"\n\nHe was almost right. A crude way of summarizing the remaining viable contenders in the Democratic field is to note that voters have a choice of: a former mayor who championed stop-and-frisk practices that targeted African-American and Latino men; another former mayor , who fired a black police chief after he recorded phone calls in which senior white officers made racist comments; a former prosecutor who may have helped send a wrongfully accused black teen-ager to prison; a former Vice-President who co-wrote the 1994 crime bill; a democratic socialist who voted for and defended that bill; or Senator Elizabeth Warren , who has held office only since 2013, and has no comparable stain on her record. Individual politicians often face liabilities with particular segments of the electorate. It's unusual, though, for so many in one field to be susceptible on such a similar theme; a now entirely white Democratic slate is being asked to explain past positions on criminal-justice issues, and, specifically, the effects of those positions on people of color.\n\nHow did the Democrats end up here? Part of the problem dates to the 1994 crime bill , which Joe Biden spearheaded, as the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and President Bill Clinton signed into law. The bill was a response to alarming rates of violent crime-and to Republicans' accusations that Democrats were soft on the issue. It included an assault-weapons ban and the Violence Against Women Act, but it also imposed harsh federal sentences and mandatory \"three strikes\" rules. Even so, no one in the Democratic leadership then could have predicted that criminal-justice reform would factor quite as it has in current politics. Hillary Clinton held public office from 2001 to 2013, but it wasn't until 2016 that she was called out for a remark she had made in 1996, about \"superpredators,\" saying that \"we have to bring them to heel.\" Before this election, Biden was rarely challenged on his role in the crime bill. The problem isn't just the bill but the cultural devastation of mass incarceration that it seemed to engender, and that cloud has hung over the Party, creating vulnerabilities even for younger, more progressive, and nonwhite Democrats. Senator Kamala Harris 's 2020 campaign was hounded by concerns regarding her years as a prosecutor, and Senator Cory Booker dropped out before questions were widely raised about oversight of the Newark Police Department during his tenure as mayor.\n\nIn an unimaginable irony-it seems that nearly all our current ironies were unimaginable not long ago-the situation has provided an opportunity for Donald Trump . The President frequently appears challenged by the English language, but he is fluent in cynicism. In 2016, he both proclaimed that he was the \"law and order\" candidate and asked African-Americans, \"What do you have to lose?\" In fact, almost a million fewer African-Americans voted that year than in 2012. Some portion of that drop reflected the fact that it was the first election in eight years without a black candidate at the top of the ticket; another part may be attributed to voter-suppression tactics. But it also stemmed from a perception that Hillary Clinton was no different, or at least no better, than Trump on matters of race-and that perception was driven by concerns about criminal justice. In 2016, Trump won just eight per cent of the black vote, but he got a surprising thirteen per cent of the black male vote.\n\nIt is pedestrian, at this point, to note that there were differences between Trump and Clinton. Big ones. Trump's racial cynicism reached a zenith with his signing, in December, 2018, of the First Step Act , which sets out to redress the disparities of federal sentencing guidelines. But he is no reformer. He pushed his first Attorney General, Jeff Sessions , to crack down on low-level drug offenders. Sessions also instructed U.S. Attorneys to seek the death penalty in some drug cases, and halted programs that sought to reform chronically troubled police departments.\n\nNonetheless, Trump is courting the black vote. He regularly touts a record low unemployment rate among African-Americans (while declining to point out that it is sixty-seven per cent higher than the national average). In September, he told leaders from historically black colleges and universities that his commitment to them was \"bigger and better and stronger than any Administration by far.\" In October, he hosted a photo-ready gathering of black conservatives at the White House. At this year's State of the Union address, he introduced people of color who were recipients of his beneficence-schoolchildren, veterans, a single mother-even as he slipped a Presidential Medal of Freedom to Rush Limbaugh . Most pointedly, his campaign aired an ad during the Super Bowl that featured Alice Marie Johnson, a black woman who had served twenty-two years of a life term for a nonviolent drug offense, before Trump commuted her sentence, at the behest of Kim Kardashian .\n\nHe still has a ways to go. Last month, the Washington Post reported that eighty-three per cent of African-Americans believe that Trump is a racist, and sixty-five per cent think that this is \"a bad time\" to be black in America. His strategy, though, seems designed to persuade black voters not so much that he is better than they thought but that the Democratic nominee will be worse. (Given the latest news reports, we can expect this reasoning to feature in Russian social-media disinformation campaigns, as it did in 2016.) The no-difference argument will still be false, regardless of who the Democrats' eventual nominee is, on every issue-criminal justice, health care, education, gun control, immigration, climate change-that disproportionately affects people of color. And no Democrat will ask Hollywood to bring back movies like the racist classic \"Gone with the Wind,\" as Trump did at a rally last week.\n\nIt is undeniable that Trump stokes the fury of voters who support him; less recognized is his clear hope to induce despair in those who do not. The imperative for Democrats is to defeat not only Trump but also the cynicism that abides him. One calculation for his reëlection isn't how many African-Americans will vote for him. It's how many will be dissuaded from voting at all. ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Getting Out the Black Vote in Alabama\n\nLarry and Laurie are an elderly white couple who live in Montgomery,\nAlabama. He's a lawyer, she's a doctor. (They asked that I not use their\nlast names.) Over the past few weeks, they've been helping Doug Jones\nget out the vote in mostly black neighborhoods in their home city.\nJones, the Democrat facing Roy Moore, the Republican candidate, in\nTuesday's unusually competitive special election to fill Jeff Sessions's\nformer Senate seat, told me on Friday that he has more than fifteen thousand volunteers around the state. Of\nAlabama's major metropolises, Montgomery, where Moore's controversial\nFoundation for Moral Law is based and where Sarah Palin rallied support for the Republican in September, appears to have the Jones campaign's smallest footprint.\nOn Sunday, after church, Larry and Laurie drove their Subaru Outback\naround Haardt Estates, a middle-class neighborhood on the south side\nwith ranch-style homes dating back to the nineteen-fifties. Wreaths\ndecorated their doors; snow was still visible in patches of\nafternoon shade. \"This was an all-white neighborhood, decades ago,\"\nLarry told me. \"With fair-housing laws, all of a sudden a couple blacks\nmoved in and all the whites moved and the prices plummeted. These folks\nhere now got great buys.\"\n\nIn 2011, Alabama passed a law requiring that voters present a photo I.D. at the polls. The law took effect in 2014, and, in 2015, the Alabama\nN.A.A.C.P. and Greater Birmingham Ministries, a multi-faith nonprofit, filed a lawsuit ,\narguing that the legislation is discriminatory. That same year, Alabama\nclosed driver's-license bureaus in eight of the ten counties with \" the highest percentage of non-white registered voters .\"\nAccording to the N.A.A.C.P., as of March, more than a hundred thousand\nregistered voters in Alabama could not vote because they did not have the proper I.D .\nMost of those voters were black or Latino. (The lawsuit is scheduled to\ngo to trial early next year.) Meanwhile, as a new article in Mother Jones notes , Alabama's chief elections official, the Republican John Merrill, has\nsaid that voting should not be easy to do. \"As long as I'm secretary of\nstate of Alabama, you're going to have to show some initiative to become\na registered voter in this state,\" he told a documentary filmmaker last year.\n\nIn Haardt Estates, Larry and Laurie pulled over and got out to knock on\nsome doors. Laurie rubbed her hands together for warmth beneath a\nlong-leaf pine. \"People always said, 'It'll snow in Alabama before you\nelect a Democrat to the senate.' Well, it snowed.\" She pulled out her\nphone and tapped an app called MiniVAN ,\nwhich sends lists of voters-names, ages, addresses, and their likely\nvoting preference-to canvassers in the field. \"The Democratic Party in\nAlabama is essentially nonfunctional,\" she said. \"So the campaign put\nthis together. They have the technology.\"\n\nLarry and Laurie were forty stops in when they arrived at an old\nfriend's home. \"Dolores!\" they exclaimed, as a retired lawyer walked\noutside. Dolores told her friends that she'd had three signs stolen so\nfar-that was the only reason there wasn't one in the yard. This was\nhappening to her neighbors, too, she said. But she seemed optimistic\nabout the vote. \"I didn't make it to church today, but I understand our\nbishop gave an impassioned speech about Doug,\" she said. \"The\nprogressive Democrats will be out. Everybody on this block is good.\" She\nwaved, heading back inside. \"We just need to turn some of those\nRepublicans.\"\n\nAt the next stop, a reverend in a collared University of Alabama\nfootball T-shirt said he didn't \"do signs,\" but that Jones already had\nhis vote. As Larry and Laurie headed to the next house, a young woman in\na car slowed down, then stopped and rolled down her window. \"Gimme one\nof them signs to put in my yard!\" she yelled. Laurie asked how many.\nAfter turning down her music, the woman said, \"Stick whatever you want\nto in my yard.\"\n\nThe next two houses wanted signs, too. \"We understand it's a bubble,\"\nLaurie said. \"We've been given a list of 'likely democratic voters.' But\nit's encouraging to have really nice, energetic comments.\" About a third\nof the self-described Jones supporters they spoke with took signs. \"One\nman told me he was reluctant to put a yard sign out 'for security\nreasons,' \" Larry said. \"It reminded me of the extent of cultural\nintimidation that still occurs. To support white supremacy, there was a\nclosed society that intimidated folks with another view: run them out of\nthe South or lynch them. We've still got a very narrow view of what\nproper political discourse is here. We don't have a vigorous, open\npolitical debate.\" He added, \"Several people mentioned today that they\ndidn't want to show their neighbors how they were voting.\"\n\n\"One man looked both ways, to make sure no one was listening, and then\nsaid, 'I'm gonna vote for him, but I don't want a sign,' \" Laurie said.\nAccording to campaign records, this man's neighbors were also registered\nDemocrats.\n\nMost of the people whom Larry and Laurie had spoken to over the past few\nweeks knew who Jones was. If they didn't, Larry and Laurie found that it\nwas more effective to say that John Lewis supports Jones than to say\nthat Jones is a Democrat. \"Lewis was the clincher,\" Larry said.\nIssue-wise, voters most often wanted to know about Jones's position on\nhealth care. Only a few volunteered an opinion of Moore. (One called him \" that pedophile .\")\n\nLater in the evening, I attended a party a few miles away in Cloverdale,\nan upper-middle-class neighborhood where a fairly diverse crowd of Jones\nsupporters gathered over cocktails. Among them was a\nninety-nine-year-old Alabamian named Henrietta MacGuire. She looked back\non nearly a century of local politics. \"Alabama never loses an\nopportunity to lose an opportunity,\" she said. \"This is one of the\nlowest points I've seen, with Roy Moore's candidacy. Even for Alabama,\nit's a low point.\" MacGuire went on, \"What is so depressing is that the\nperception the country has of this state, all of the clichés, are made\nto seem exactly correct: anti-intellectual, racist, all of it. But there\nare also lots of people here who are well-educated, well-read, widely\ntravelled, liberal. They're always kind of pushed aside and the only\nthing that comes forth is the stereotypes, the Roy Moores.\"\n\nThe party had a throwback, salon-like quality, with doctors, lawyers,\nteachers, historians and others revelling in a historic moment. Jones is\nnot favored to win, but, the party's guests knew, he has a real chance . A retired preservationist named Ellen Mertins, who has lived in\nMontgomery her whole life, listed the three things she's been most\nconcerned about of late: the Senate race, climate change, and \"giving\nvitamins to Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\" She'd been canvassing and making phone\ncalls, too. \"I'm a historian and I look at the long view, but it's hard\nnot to be a little excited right now,\" she said.\n\nNearby, Lynn Boyd looked contemplative. Boyd teaches counselor education\nat Troy University. \"I vote in every election,\" Boyd said. She went on,\n\"This is the first real chance we've had in a long, long time. It'd be a\ngut punch if Jones lost. Not as bad as Hillary losing to Trump-I don't\nhave that much anxiety in my chest-but it would be a punch.\" Jones,\nshe said, is \"speaking about education, building the military, health\ncare. Issues that are relevant to me.\"\n\nShawn Stewart worked the bar. \"Even if it snows, I'm going to vote on\nTuesday,\" she told me. Unlike the party's guests, she was not excited about either candidate, though she, too, had decided to vote for Jones. \"It doesn't look like much of a choice to me,\" she said, adding, \"It's Russian roulette, just take a chance. But I'm voting in this one.\"\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Joe Biden's South Carolina Win, Black Voters, and the Democrats' Way Forward\n\nWhen Representative Jim Clyburn stepped onto the stage at Trident Technical College, in North Charleston, last Wednesday, to endorse Joe Biden in South Carolina's Democratic Presidential primary, he wasn't simply throwing his influence as the highest-ranking African-American member of Congress behind his longtime ally, he was offering an answer to a question that has bedevilled the Palmetto State and, for that matter, the entire Democratic Party since it began fielding would-be successors to Donald Trump . How much, everyone seemed to wonder, of the old order still stands? The ascent to front-runner status of Senator Bernie Sanders , an uppercase Independent and a lowercase socialist, and the concomitant notion of \"Berning down\" the institutional centrism of the Democratic Party, which favored Hillary Clinton four years ago, has raised serious, maybe even existential, questions about the future direction of the Party. In the three previous Democratic contests  this year, the best that the moderate wing of the Party had achieved was a chaotic, inconclusive draw in Iowa, where Pete Buttigieg , whose appeal among African-American voters had fluctuated between tiny and minuscule, proved unusually popular in school-gymnasium  and church-basement caucus spots across the state. All of this is to say that a lot of people had a lot of reasons to pay close attention to what Clyburn had to say last week. And he said a lot.\n\nEmily Clyburn, who had been married to the congressman for fifty-eight years-they met when they were students and got arrested at the same civil-rights protest-died in September. The veneer of seniority and gravitas that accompanies Clyburn was burnished by an additional layer of public sympathy, which is why it meant something that he framed his endorsement of Biden not only in terms of his own relationship with the former Vice-President but also in the context of his late wife's regard for him. \"We often talked about the leadership of this country,\" Clyburn said. \"And there's nobody who Emily loved as a leader in this country more than she loved Joe Biden.\"\n\nYet Clyburn's endorsement is only one factor in what happened in South Carolina, where Biden won forty-eight per cent of the vote on Saturday. That result came in the context of questions about how much sway the Democratic leadership and the traditional brokers of black support hold in the current era, particularly in a state like South Carolina, where the Democratic electorate is sixty per cent African-American. Twelve years ago, the last time there was a competitive primary in the state, the Party establishment and some traditional black leaders, including members of the clergy, lined up early behind Hillary Clinton. Barack Obama, relying on his background as a community organizer, did an end-run around the establishment, garnering support from grassroots community figures and building a parallel network that, in the end, gave him a twenty-nine-point margin of victory over Clinton (and nearly forty points over John Edwards, the former senator from North Carolina who is a South Carolinian by birth).\n\nThe possibility that a similar rejection of an establishment candidate might occur this year was not far from the minds of people I spoke to in Charleston. Anton Gunn, a former state representative who ran Obama's 2008 primary campaign in South Carolina, told me, ahead of the vote, \"I would not be surprised to see some elected official endorse one candidate, and his entire district vote for someone else.\" Jaime Harrison, an African-American Democrat who is running to unseat Senator Lindsey Graham this November and chaired the South Carolina Democratic Party from 2013 through 2017, said, \"I think, compared to the last time around, there were many more people who were undecided very late in this election, compared to what I saw in '16, or compared to 2008.\" But Harrison, who also served as an aide to Clyburn from 2003 to 2008, added that the congressman is \"the only person that has significant sway\" in the state in terms of influencing voters, \"and that's because he's just so well-respected across that state.\"\n\nThe race between Harrison and Graham is a window into how closely South Carolina's politics have been wired into national concerns. In 2017, Graham's approval rating among South Carolina Republicans was below fifty per cent. Two years later, he had a seventy-four-per-cent approval rating among the same voters, a rise widely attributed to his close embrace of Donald Trump. That pivot also generated antipathy from Democrats and voters far outside South Carolina, which is one reason that Harrison was able to raise more than three million dollars last quarter, a record for a Democratic Senate challenger in South Carolina. When Trump arrived in North Charleston to hold a rally the night before the primary-in which he basically live-trolled the entire slate of Democrats vying to replace him-both Graham and Tim Scott, the state's junior senator (and one of the three current African-American members of that chamber), were seated prominently near the front.\n\nMeanwhile, polls had shown Sanders eating into Biden's support among black voters. Outside the Charleston Charter School, in the North Central neighborhood, I spoke to a man named Christopher President. (Me: \"Like President of the United States?\" Him: \"Not like this President. Maybe like the one we had four years ago.\") When I asked him whom he'd voted for, he replied, \"Crazy Bernie,\" but then made sure I understood where he was coming from, adding, \"I don't mean crazy in a bad way.\" He was appropriating Donald Trump's insult for the current Democratic front-runner. \"I believe, if he gets into the seat, he'd do everything he said he'd do,\" President said. He echoed what other Sanders supporters in and around the city told me. Trump, for his part, has welcomed a challenge from Sanders. South Carolina has an open primary, and, on Friday night, Trump instructed the Republican faithful in South Carolina to vote for Sanders. This meant that Trump was telling people to help a man he has called a threat to the American way of life win the Democratic nomination. Even if that was because Trump thinks he can more easily beat Sanders, such a cynical message is likely to have troubled some Republicans.\n\nFurther complicating matters, Tom Steyer's campaign had also set up shop in South Carolina, hoping that it could ignite a movement there. Steyer and his wife had embedded in the state and engaged in the kind of retail politicking that other campaigns couldn't afford in terms of time, and certainly not in terms of money. Gunn told me that the prevailing wisdom was that Steyer would more like to take votes from Biden than he would from Sanders.\n\nThe Biden campaign limped into Columbia hemorrhaging cash, and, after failing to win any of the previous contests, was not able to fully leverage the black support in South Carolina that had turned Barack Obama into a front-runner in 2008. It is said that nothing succeeds like success, but it's equally true that nothing loses like loss. Twelve years ago, Obama's victory in Iowa generated a cascade of support in South Carolina. Black voters, observing his ability to cross over with white voters, reasoned that a vote for him would not be just an exercise in racial symbolism. Biden faced the opposite dilemma: after coming in fourth in Iowa, fifth in New Hampshire, and second in Nevada, the worry was that black voters in South Carolina would begin seeing his campaign as a dead letter. Gunn had put together a focus group of black women-\"If I talk to ten or fifteen black women and they don't like you, you ain't got no shot,\" he said-but he saw no real pattern of preference for a candidate, even heading into the last week of the campaign. Even Clyburn, as he gave his endorsement to Biden, noted that he had encountered many young African-Americans who were undecided about whom to vote for in the days ahead of the election.\n\nBut, on Wednesday night, CNN held a town-hall event with the candidates at the Memminger Auditorium, in Charleston, which is about eight blocks away from Emanuel A.M.E. Church, where, in 2015, nine congregants at Bible study were shot and killed by a white supremacist . In the audience on Wednesday was the Reverend Anthony Thompson, whose wife, Myra, had been among the victims. His devotion to her even in death has been notable; he tends a church garden dedicated to her and occasionally still speaks of her in the present tense. Thompson asked Biden about his faith and what role it would play in making decisions for the country. Biden, who met Thompson after the murders and occasionally calls to check on him, responded in the context of his own experiences with grief.  \"Reverend, I kinda know what it's like to lose family,\" Biden said. He reminded Thompson that, after he and Obama had attended the funeral service for Clementa Pinckney, the pastor and state senator killed in the church, he'd returned that Sunday to attend service. \"I'd just lost my son,\" he said. \"I wanted some hope.\" He pointed to his awe that the family members forgave the white supremacist who had killed their loved ones,  then quoted Kierkegaard: \"Faith sees best in the dark.\" Biden concluded by saying that Thompson and the other family members were to thank for finally getting the Confederate flag removed from the state capitol in South Carolina, a line that brought the crowd in the auditorium to its feet.\n\nIt was a notable moment to observe on television, but a galvanic one in person, as Marjory Wentworth, a poet and professor at the College of Charleston, told me. \"It felt like there was no one in the room besides Joe Biden and Anthony Thompson,\" she said. On the trail, Biden has sometimes seemed as if he's lost the pop on his fastball; the moment reminded the audience of who he is, and it highlighted the contrast between him-a man who has endured enough grief to understand it like a native tongue-and Trump, a man who, speaking in North Charleston two nights later, claimed that fears of the coronavirus are driven by the Democrats' \"new hoax.\"\n\nThe results in South Carolina appear clarifying, at least superficially. Despite the many seeming contingencies and questions about Biden's viability there, the black vote broke for him late in the race, at some sixty per cent, and early analysis suggests that Clyburn's endorsement was a big reason why.  And, even with crossover Republicans going for Sanders-a small group , despite Trump's exhortations-Biden received more than twice as many votes as the Vermont senator, who came in second, with nineteen per cent. After all the campaigning, candidates tend to treat each state's results as if they were the credits in a mediocre movie-they leave before they're over. Last week, when Sanders won the Nevada caucuses, he delivered his victory speech from Texas, where he was laying groundwork for Super Tuesday. But Biden stayed in Columbia on Saturday night. He bounded onto the stage with the vigor of a younger man and thanked Clyburn for lifting \"me and this campaign on his shoulders,\" an unusually appreciative and deferential statement for a man taking a victory lap. He looked at Clyburn the way a boxer looks at his trainer after winning a round.\n\nAnother lesson, perhaps, to be learned from Tom Steyer's moribund performance is that money is many things, but it is not all things, a point that may hold significance for Michael Bloomberg in Tuesday's elections. Both Steyer and Pete Buttigieg suspended their campaigns in the wake of poor performances on Saturday, as, on Monday, did Senator Amy Klobuchar. She announced that she will endorse Biden; the Times reported that Buttigieg would, too. Yet it is not entirely clear that what happened in South Carolina will translate elsewhere. Biden is receiving a large boost in cash and morale, but there are precious few figures like Jim Clyburn elsewhere in the country. (The apparent effect of his endorsement spawned a wave of suggestions on social media and elsewhere that Obama should endorse Biden ahead of Super Tuesday, a suggestion that Obama quickly shot down .) Whatever else Biden gets in his quest for the nomination, he'll mostly have to win under his own steam.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Suppression of the Black Vote Is No Relic\n\nAt several points during this campaign, Barack Obama has urged voters to support Hillary Clinton not because of her long experience, or because of his estimation that Donald Trump is \"uniquely unqualified\" for the Presidency, but in order to preserve his own legacy. He said this most explicitly at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's annual dinner, in September, where he implored African-Americans to back the Democratic candidate.\n\n\"After we have achieved historic turnout in 2008 and 2012, especially in the African-American community, I will consider it a personal insult-an insult to my legacy-if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election,\" Obama said. \"You want to give me a good send-off? Go vote.\"\n\nObama's two Presidential campaigns were defined in part by the black voters they brought to the polls. In both 2008 and 2012, African-American women voted at a higher rate than any other demographic group in the country. In recent months, Obama has been asking those voters to preserve the work of his Administration: Trump has promised to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the Iran deal. But, aside from his desire to protect those policies, by appealing to black voters to go to the polls he was also asking them to counter a new effort to suppress the black vote, which grew in strength during his Presidency.\n\nOn November 5, 2008, the morning after Obama's election, the Wall Street Journal published an editorial noting that \"a man of mixed race has now reached the pinnacle of U.S. power only two generations since the end of Jim Crow.\" To the Journal , this was \"a tribute to American opportunity,\" and proof that egalitarianism had triumphed in the United States. \"One promise of his victory is that perhaps we can put to rest the myth of racism as a barrier to achievement in this splendid country,\" the editors wrote. \"Mr. Obama has a special obligation to help do so.\"\n\nThroughout the campaign in 2008, Obama alternately laughed off and rejected the idea that his campaign could or would allow the country to transcend its history of racism. In a speech on race, given in response to reports about the inflammatory sermons of his longtime pastor, Jeremiah Wright, he remarked that, \"contrary to the claims of some of my critics, black and white, I have never been so naïve as to believe that we can get beyond our racial division in a single election cycle, or with a single candidacy-particularly a candidacy as imperfect as my own.\"\n\nYet the idea that Obama's candidacy represented \"racial reconciliation on the cheap,\" as he put it in that speech, persisted into his Presidency. A version of the Journal's argument appeared in Shelby County v. Holder, the Supreme Court decision that, in 2013, gutted the Voting Rights Act.\n\nIn the majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts held that the act's \"special provisions\" for monitoring the electoral laws of states with histories of racial discrimination against black voters were a relic of the nineteen-sixties. During arguments, Justice Roberts asked Donald Verrilli, Jr., the Solicitor General, whether the Obama Administration believed that \"the citizens of the South are more racist than the citizens of the North.\"\n\nWhat Justice Roberts's question implied was that the election of a black President to a second term surely served as evidence that the Voting Rights Act, which was passed when there were no black elected officials in statewide or congressional office in the South, had served its purpose. Justice Antonin Scalia went further, referring to the act as \"the perpetuation of a racial entitlement.\" Another interpretation of Roberts's question, however, is that it's roughly akin to citing declining numbers of drunk drivers as evidence that laws criminalizing the behavior had served their purpose and could now be relaxed.\n\nThe most transparent evidence that relaxing the rules does not improve compliance is the fact that, in 2016, there are nearly nine hundred fewer polling places in states previously covered by the Voting Rights Act than there were for the 2012 election. Moreover, African-American advocacy groups have to keep fending off new efforts to suppress voting. On Friday, a federal judge in North Carolina threw out an attempt to have nearly four thousand individuals, many of them African-Americans, struck from the voting rolls in Beaufort, Moore, and Cumberland counties. The move came in response to a lawsuit filed by the N.A.A.C.P. In July, federal judges struck down a North Carolina voter-I.D. law that targeted black voters with \"surgical precision.\" On Sunday, the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense Fund tweeted a reminder that the Voting Rights Act \"prohibits any attempt to 'intimidate, threaten, or coerce' \" prospective voters.\n\nAt the time of the Shelby decision, observers pointed out that the Supreme Court contention that the Voting Rights Act unfairly presumed racism among white Southerners was as much a justification for expanding the law as it was for dismantling it. In short, if access to the ballot is no longer a uniquely Southern concern, that might be because the problem has become more widespread. Consider the fact that the biggest proponent of voter intimidation is not a Mississippi sheriff trawling registration rolls for black people but a real-estate developer born and raised in Queens.\n\nTrumpism has expanded the challenges to African-American voters. Late last month, the Pennsylvania G.O.P. filed a suit alleging that the state laws that restricted poll watchers to the county in which they were registered was unconstitutional. If it had been successful, the suit would have facilitated poll watchers from across the state converging upon areas where they suspect, with little evidence, that election fraud may take place. On Friday, a federal judge ruled against the Party, calling their suit an \"extraordinary remedy\" to the potential problem.\n\nIt nonetheless remains that the most fraught election in modern American history is also one in which access to the vote is most tenuous and imperilled. The irony of this state of affairs is that past progress may become an obstacle to moving forward-and, indeed, may become the basis for us heedlessly, recklessly moving backward.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "The First Question for Democrats to Answer About the Election: What Happened?\n\nJust four days after the election, Democratic politicians and activists are still coming to terms with a result that bitterly disappointed many of them, despite Joe Biden's victory in the Presidential race. In a heated private conference call on Thursday, centrist and progressive members of the House Democratic caucus jostled over who or what was to blame for the Party's unexpectedly weak showing in congressional races . (With a number of contests still to be called, the G.O.P. has already made a net gain of five seats .) At the local level, there is also a lot of sparring over why the Party failed in its bid to gain control of legislatures in a number of big states, including Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Texas.\n\nThe first step in any political inquest is to figure out exactly what happened. The Democrats' struggles in local and statewide races will take more time to unpack, but there are data already available about the race at the top of the ticket that can offer some insight into what happened in 2020. Even here, however, there isn't much agreement. The nationwide exit poll that Edison Research carries out for a consortium of media companies indicated that Trump got fifty-seven per cent of the white vote, the same number that he got in 2016, but also did better than expected among minority voters, particularly Hispanics. Some Democratic activists have questioned the poll findings, however. \"Are these exit polls real?\" Ezra Levin, the co-founder of Indivisible, a grassroots progressive organization, asked on Twitter. When I messaged Levin and asked for his interpretation of the election results, he replied, \"We just don't have enough info yet to really say what happened. I have no idea if most of the quick takes out there right now are right or wrong, but nobody really does yet.\"\n\nFollow the latest results from the 2020 race .\n\nLevin isn't the only person querying the exit poll, which was conducted outside of polling centers across the country (and by telephone in an effort to reach people who voted early or by mail). Partly because of the challenge in obtaining representative samples, and for other reasons, some academic experts on voting trends are also highly skeptical of the network exit poll. \"I think all of their estimates are pretty suspect,\" Ruy Teixeira, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, told me on Friday. Citing an example, Teixeira pointed out that, although other estimates have suggested that at least seventy per cent of the 2020 electorate was white, the exit poll came up with a figure of sixty-five per cent. \"Not on this planet, not in this election,\" Teixeira said.\n\nA longtime student of psephology, Teixeira is a co-author of the influential book \" The Emerging Democratic Majority ,\" from 2002. More recently, he and some co-authors have produced a series of detailed studies of the U.S. electorate, which are called \"States of Change,\" and which utilize data from a number of different sources, including the Census Bureau, the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, and actual election returns down to the county level. Rather than relying on the exit poll to analyze what went down in this election, Teixeira said that he preferred to look at the findings of a different survey, the A.P. VoteCast , which questioned more than a hundred thousand voters in all fifty states during the week leading up to November 3rd. To see how 2020 compared to 2016, Teixeira then compared the A.P. VoteCast findings to the analyses of the 2016 election by the \"States of Change\" project. Although this comparison isn't an apples-to-apples one, it does provide an alternative way of looking at the election results and identifying their key features. \"It's not great, but it's probably the best we have at the moment,\" Teixeira said.\n\nIn some ways, this exercise produces similar results to a simple comparison of the exit polls from 2016 and 2020. Both methods confirm that Trump's voters are overwhelmingly white and predominantly male. The two methods also indicate that, relative to Hillary Clinton's performance four years ago, Biden made up substantial ground among seniors and white voters without a bachelor's degree-two groups that Trump carried by large margins in 2016. The two methods also show Trump getting roughly a third of the Latino vote nationwide. However, Teixeira's methodology produces quantitatively different results, and it fails to confirm the widely publicized exit-poll finding that Trump attracted a lot more Black voters this year than he did four years ago. \"I am very unpersuaded that the Democrats' margin among Black voters went down a lot,\" Teixeira said. \"I think it was probably relatively stable.\"\n\nAnother big difference between Teixeira's analysis and the media narrative taking hold in the past few days is the emphasis that he places on Biden's ability to limit his losses among whites without a college degree, a group central to Trump's base. For decades, this group made up the majority of the electorate, and, this year, it still accounted for more than two-fifths of it, Teixeira and his colleagues reckon. In 2016, Trump beat Clinton by a whopping thirty-two percentage points in this demographic, according to estimates contained in the latest \"States of Change\" report. This year, Trump's margin over Biden in this group was twenty-five points, the A.P. VoteCast found. To be sure, that was another big victory for Trump. But it represented a seven-point shift to the Democratic candidate relative to 2016, and Teixeira argues that this was a key factor-perhaps the key factor-that laid the groundwork for Biden's victory in the Electoral College. \"The theory that Biden would win, to a great extent, because he could reduce the white, non-college deficit turned out to be true,\" Teixeira said. \"He just didn't win by as much as people wanted. Plus, people have trouble getting their minds around the fact that to go from minus thirty-two to minus twenty-five is just as good as going from plus seven to plus fourteen. And if the former group is bigger, it is actually better.\"\n\nTurning to college-educated whites, Teixeira's method suggests that Biden didn't actually make up much ground in this demographic, despite all the attention that has been paid to suburban voters. By contrast, the Edison exit poll indicated that Biden turned Clinton's three-point deficit among these voters from 2016 into a tie with Trump, at forty-nine per cent. Teixeira's figures do suggest that the white college demographic was important in some key states, such as Michigan, where Biden improved Clinton's margin by fourteen points. On a nationwide basis, however, the exit poll and Teixeira's analysis both indicate that the shift in this white college demographic was smaller than the shift in the white non-college one. \"The biggest swing in the Democrats' direction was not among white college voters, it was among white non-college voters,\" Teixeira said.\n\nThe fact that Biden outperformed Clinton among older Americans, who are particularly vulnerable to COVID -19, appears to be another key element in his victory. This is evident in the exit-poll data, which indicate that the former Vice-President reduced Trump's 2016 margin of seven points to three points among voters aged sixty-five and over, who make up more than a fifth of the electorate. It's even more stark in Teixeira's comparison. His \"States of Change\" data suggest that Trump carried the senior demographic by fifteen points in 2016-a much bigger margin than the exit poll suggested. For 2020, the A.P. VoteCast survey agrees with the Edison exit poll that Trump led Biden by three points among seniors. So, going by Teixeira's methodology, there was a hefty shift of twelve points relative to 2016. That jibes with some of the polling done during the campaign, which I wrote about as far back as June . But for Democrats it raises questions about 2024. Assuming that the pandemic is long gone by then, it would seem reasonable to suppose that some of the senior vote might shift back to a Republican Presidential candidate. Which means that Biden, or whoever the Democratic candidate is, would need to make the margin up elsewhere.\n\nThe gains that Trump posted among Hispanic voters are another pressing concern for the Democrats. According to the Edison exit poll, thirty-two per cent of Latinos voted for Trump nationwide, compared to twenty-eight per cent in 2016. The A.P. VoteCast survey estimate of the Trump vote among Latinos is even higher-thirty-five per cent. If you compare this figure to the \"States of Change\" estimates, you find that Trump reduced his deficit in the Latino demographic from thirty-seven points in 2016 to twenty-eight points this year. With Latinos now making about a seventh of the electorate, the largest minority group, this is a big shift. And, according to Teixeira's analysis, it wasn't confined to Cubans in Florida, or even to the whole of Florida and parts of Texas. It was evident in places like Arizona and Nevada, too. According to the \"States of Change\" estimates for the 2016 election, Clinton's winning margin among Hispanics in these two states was thirty-three points and twenty-two points, respectively. This year, according to the findings of A.P. VoteCast, Biden's margins were twenty one points and ten points. In other words, there were double-digit shifts to Trump in both states.\n\nFinally, back to Black voters, who make up about twelve per cent of the electorate. According to the exit poll, Trump raised his share of the Black vote from eight per cent in 2016 to twelve per cent this year-and to eighteen per cent among Black men. Not surprisingly, given Trump's racial incitements and the derogatory comments that he has repeatedly made about Black politicians and journalists, these findings have received a lot of attention-but Teixeira's analysis contradicts them. Based on \"States of Change\" data, he and his co-authors estimate the Black vote for Trump in 2016 to have been nine per cent, and the A.P. VoteCast puts the figure for 2020 year at eight per cent.\n\nIf these two figures are accurate, there is no \"Trump bump\" in the Black vote to explain. In both of the last two elections, he received the support of fewer than one in ten African-Americans. But Teixeira would readily admit that this is only a provisional finding, as are the others he relayed to me. He said that he is looking forward to getting access to more definitive data in a month or two, including some based on voter files and precinct-level voting figures. \"More data is needed, as always,\" he said. The Democratic Party doesn't have time to wait. Its inquest has already begun.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "The Plan to Build a Capital for Black Capitalism\n\nIn the fall of 1968, Jet , the Black weekly magazine, devoted a special issue to the upcoming election. On the cover was a cheerful headline: \" HOW BLACK VOTE CAN ELECT NEXT PRESIDENT. \" Inside, the editors were less upbeat, reproaching the candidates for not doing more to \"woo actively\" the Black vote. In an effort to do some last-minute wooing, both of the major candidates had taken out two-page advertisements in the issue. Hubert Humphrey, the Democrat, was popular with Black voters, and sought to remind readers of something he felt they should already know. \"Vote for Hubert Humphrey and you'll help elect the right man President,\" his advertisement said. \"Don't vote and you'll help elect the wrong one.\" The \"wrong one\"- Richard Nixon , the Republican contender-had a more specific pitch. His ad showed a Black man in a letterman sweater, beneath the exhortation \"This time, vote like Homer Pitts' whole world depended on it.\" Pitts, it seemed, was a fictional college student facing an uncertain future. And there was a Presidential candidate who wanted to help him:\n\nA vote for Richard Nixon for President is a vote for a man who wants Homer to have the chance to own his own business. Richard Nixon believes strongly in black capitalism. Because black capitalism is black power in the best sense of the word. . . . It's the key to the black man's fight for equality-for a piece of the action.\n\nThis was the heart of Nixon's outreach to Black voters in 1968: \"Black capitalism,\" an ideal of independence that promised to unite militants and moderates, Black nationalists and white centrists. This sales pitch does not seem to have been a big success. Although Nixon won, narrowly, polls and voting data suggest that Black voters went predominantly for Humphrey. And yet the notion of \"Black capitalism\" gained influence, prompting an ongoing debate about what it meant, and whether it represented progress. The Black Panther Party often denounced capitalism, and Bobby Seale, who helped found the group, wrote in 1970 that Black capitalism was part of the problem. \"We do not fight exploitative capitalism with black capitalism,\" he declared. \"We fight capitalism with basic socialism.\" But the next year another founding Panther, Huey P. Newton, wrote that Black capitalism could contribute to liberation, and that rejecting it was \"a counterrevolutionary position.\" To many Black people, \"Black capitalism\" had come to mean \"Black control\" of local neighborhoods, local industry. How could any Black Panther be opposed to that?\n\nArguments about Black capitalism were often rather theoretical. But there was one place in America where a group of pioneers tried to build a community devoted to it, upholding both Nixonian free enterprise and Black self-determination. The place was Soul City, a settlement in rural North Carolina, near the Virginia border, which was founded in 1969, and which is the subject of a new book by Thomas Healy, a law professor and a former journalist. In \" Soul City ,\" he explains how this experiment in Black capitalism was tried, and also how it failed. It is no spoiler to acknowledge this failure at the outset; Healy's subtitle refers to Soul City as \"the Lost Dream of an American Utopia.\" The modern story of race in America might be told quite differently if there really were, as there was once meant to be, a prosperous Black mini-metropolis of fifty-five thousand people in North Carolina, serving as a beacon for activists and entrepreneurs everywhere. If Soul City had succeeded, perhaps its founder would be enshrined alongside Martin Luther King, Jr. , and Malcolm X in the pantheon of Black uplift.\n\nThat founder was Floyd McKissick, a lawyer who had risen through the ranks to become the leader of the Congress of Racial Equality, or CORE , which he helped transform into a militant alternative to more cautious civil-rights organizations like the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. He left CORE, it seems, not so much because he wanted to make money as because he felt that the best way to help Black people in America was to help some of them make money. Healy argues that McKissick's dream of a new Black homeland in rural North Carolina could have come true, if not for the backlash it inspired. \"It was going to be a beautiful place to live,\" one of the earliest residents said.\n\nHealy is one of many who have described Soul City as a would-be utopia, but McKissick viewed himself as a realist and a wised-up dealmaker. Like many Black capitalists throughout history, he had been frustrated by the slow pace and limited success of governmental reforms. \"Unless the Black Man attains economic independence,\" he wrote, \"any 'political independence' will be an illusion.\" As he discovered, these two forms of independence can be hard to disentangle. The demise of Soul City effectively ended McKissick's time as a national public figure, but the lure of Black economic independence never faded. Last year, following the protests for racial justice, many organizations and corporations launched initiatives to support Black-owned businesses; Facebook urged users to \"#BuyBlack for the holidays.\" The idea hasn't changed much since Nixon's time: to see that every Homer Pitts gets his \"piece of the action.\" As an ideal, Black capitalism has endured. But how does it work?\n\nMcKissick had once been an accomplished integrationist. After being turned away from the University of North Carolina's law school, which barred Black students, he became one of the plaintiffs in a case brought by the N.A.A.C.P., which won a court order in 1951 that obliged U.N.C. to admit McKissick and change its policies. (Once there, McKissick did some impromptu activism at the segregated swimming pool, jumping in fully dressed and declaring, \"It's integrated now!\") In 1959, two of his children enrolled at a previously all-white public school in Durham. And in 1966, as the newly installed national director of CORE , he joined the March Against Fear, a walking protest through Tennessee and Mississippi, alongside King and a younger radical, Stokely Carmichael. In this magazine, Renata Adler reported that McKissick initially \"mediated\" between King and his followers, who called for \"freedom now,\" and Carmichael's group, who chanted, \"Black power!\" The march helped propel \"Black power\" into the public consciousness, and it may have helped radicalize McKissick, who was with the group in Canton, Mississippi, when it was teargassed by state troopers. That night, McKissick made it clear that he was siding with Carmichael. \"They don't call it white power,\" he said, referring to the teargassers and their allies. \"They just call it power . I'm committed to non-violence, but I say what we need is to get us some black power.\"\n\nCORE had been founded, in 1942, to fight segregation; McKissick gave it a more assertively Black identity. Not long before the march, he had moved its headquarters from lower Manhattan to Harlem, and the next year CORE expunged the word \"multiracial\" from its official self-description, effectively sidelining its white members. (A Times editorial suggested that the change betokened a policy of \"segregation in reverse.\") McKissick emerges in Healy's book as a shrewd but slightly mysterious figure, propelled by a complicated combination of strategy, pride, and conviction. On April 4, 1968, he was in Cleveland, promoting an ambitious effort to get white business owners to build factories in the city's \"ghetto\" neighborhoods; the idea was that once the factories had recouped their initial investments the Black workers could assume ownership. The same day, in Memphis, King was assassinated, and McKissick responded with anger and a hint of fatalism. \"Nonviolence is a dead philosophy,\" he told the Times , \"and it was not the black people that killed it.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nAt the time, McKissick was seen as a candidate to succeed King as the preëminent voice of Black America, but McKissick realized that there could never be another leader of Black America-it was hard enough being the leader of CORE , which was riven by arguments over tactics and ideology. And so, a few months after King's death, McKissick left the group to start McKissick Enterprises, which promised to invest in everything from restaurants to book publishing. In a brochure announcing the new venture, McKissick said that his focus was \"the development of Black Economic Power,\" which he called the \"last chance to save the Republic.\" No more marching, and no more pleading-it was time to build.\n\nWithin months, McKissick Enterprises decided that it would build a city. This was not an unusual ambition; in fact, McKissick's genius was to bring together two trends then ascendant. There was a vogue for master-planned communities, sometimes known as \"new towns,\" such as Reston, Virginia, founded in 1964, and Columbia, Maryland, founded in 1967. And there was a continuing determination to transform the so-called \"ghettos\"-neighborhoods that were widely thought to be not just a reflection of Black poverty but a cause of it. McKissick proposed to rescue Black people from the economic stasis of ghettos by creating a new town designed by and for Black people. Whenever he was challenged, as he often was, McKissick stipulated that his community would be \"open to all races.\" But the name Soul City reflected the Black identity that was, for McKissick, one of its most important selling points. He was a stern and effective presence on television, with a skeptical squint and a crooked smile that could be even more skeptical than the squint. During one of his innumerable media appearances, he promised that Soul City would be \"a place where Black people can come, and know they're wanted.\"\n\nThe appeal of Soul City was a chance to start anew. McKissick didn't see the community as an extension of the long history of Black settlements in America; the whole idea was to build something where just about nothing existed, so as not to be influenced by whatever it was that made many Black neighborhoods inimical to prosperity. McKissick found a plot of eighteen hundred acres of undeveloped land, available for three hundred and ninety thousand dollars-a good price, although it was evidently about three hundred and eighty-seven thousand dollars more than McKissick Enterprises had on hand. Chase Bank agreed to loan McKissick half the purchase price, and the seller agreed to accept it as a down payment. In late February, 1969, McKissick closed the deal.\n\nThe story of Soul City has been told a number of times over the years, and few of the tellers have failed to notice the central irony: McKissick's experiment in Black independence depended on the benevolence of white government officials. As McKissick was launching his company, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968, which directed the government to finance \"the development of new communities.\" By the time McKissick bought his land, a new President had been inaugurated, and much of the history of Soul City involves McKissick doggedly attempting to shake money loose from the Nixon Administration. Dozens of construction workers took up residence in trailers on the property, but prospective employers weren't eager to move to Soul City without prospective employees, and vice versa. \"Three years of my life have gone into this project,\" McKissick wrote, at one point, to a sympathetic government official. \"I am sure my creditors within the next ten days will be on the attack unless McKissick Enterprises secures additional funds.\" In his effort to get free from white control, and from political wrangling, McKissick wound up more ensnarled in these things than ever.\n\nThe modern argument over Black capitalism began much earlier. In 1895, a Black educator named Booker T. Washington gave a speech in Atlanta calling for Black people to embrace life in the South, despite all its hardships. \"It is in the South that the Negro is given a man's chance in the commercial world,\" Washington said. He promised his Black listeners that they could prosper through hard work, and promised white listeners that Black people would not immediately demand full rights or full integration. \"In all things that are purely social we can be as separate as the fingers,\" Washington said, \"yet one as the hand in all things essential to mutual progress.\" The speech transformed Washington into a celebrity, although plenty of Black leaders disagreed with it, none more eloquently than W. E. B. Du Bois, who gave the speech a derisive nickname (\"The Atlanta Compromise\"), and argued that it was \"utterly impossible, under modern competitive methods, for workingmen and property-owners to defend their rights and exist without the right of suffrage.\" If Black people were to be effective capitalists, they had to become full citizens first.\n\nA couple of decades later, Du Bois reconsidered. In 1934, in a series of columns in The Crisis , the official publication of the N.A.A.C.P., he argued that \"thinking colored people of the United States\" were too preoccupied with integration. He suggested that, in the face of prejudice and violence, Black people should use the power of the market to liberate themselves. \"The great step ahead today is for the American Negro to accomplish his economic emancipation through voluntary determined cooperative effort,\" he wrote. He extolled the value of Black churches, colleges, and newspapers, and charged that the N.A.A.C.P. had lost sight of its historic support for \"Negro business enterprise.\"\n\nThis argument got Du Bois cancelled, in the literal sense: under pressure, he resigned from the N.A.A.C.P. and discontinued his column, despite the fact that he was the founding editor of The Crisis , and a co-founder of the N.A.A.C.P. itself. In the Pittsburgh Courier , a leading Black newspaper, Du Bois's change of heart was headline news: \" RACE STUNNED AS FORMER CHAMPION OF EQUAL RIGHTS ASSUMES PACIFIST ATTITUDE .\" In fact, the columns did not seem especially pacific. Du Bois wrote with enthusiasm about all the things Black people could do without white help. And his final dispatch for The Crisis, published in June, was an extraordinary cry of anguish and defiance:\n\nNegroes are not wanted. . . . What can we do about it? We cannot use force. We cannot enforce law, even if we get it on the statute books. So long as overwhelming public opinion sanctions and justifies and defends color segregation, we are helpless, and without remedy. . . . We have got to renounce a program that always involves humiliating self-stultifying scrambling to crawl somewhere where we are not wanted; where we crouch panting like a whipped dog. We have got to stop this and learn that on such a program they cannot build manhood. No, by God, stand erect in a mud-puddle and tell the white world to go to hell, rather than lick boots in a parlor.\n\nThe cause of Black capitalism has often been championed not by successful entrepreneurs but by leaders who wanted to \"tell the white world to go to hell,\" even if they didn't agree about where they wanted the Black world to go. In 1916, a Jamaican crusader named Marcus Garvey arrived in the United States and set about building an international movement for Black liberation. To fund his shipping company, the Black Star Line, he issued hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of shares, using the proceeds to buy three steamships, none of which turned out to be particularly seaworthy. Investors lost their money, and Garvey was convicted of fraud, but he was widely revered for his grand parades, and for his vision of a world where Black people could do without white people. He often urged Black Americans to resettle in Africa, a continent that he himself never visited.\n\nElijah Muhammad, the leader of the Nation of Islam, promoted a similar mixture of Black nationalism and Black capitalism, telling his followers, \"Build your own homes, schools, hospitals, and factories.\" Precisely because he trusted white people so little-he taught that they were devils-Muhammad warned Black people not to expect much from them, reproaching King and other civil-rights leaders for their dangerous naïveté. \"Get away from that childish way of thinking that the white man forever owes it to you to provide for you the necessities of life,\" Muhammad wrote, in 1965. He counselled his readers to buy farmland and start businesses instead.\n\nNixon was not wrong to discern in this tradition a conservative impulse. Compared with King, who had called for billions of dollars of federal aid for \"the Negro community,\" many Black-power advocates seemed to be making less expensive demands. In April, 1968, Nixon gave a radio address in which he claimed that some of the \"militant\" Black activists were on his side, or ought to be. He praised those who abandoned \"welfarist\" rhetoric in order to extol the importance of \"ownership\" and \"self-respect.\" And he called for a \"new approach\" that would be grounded in \"Black capitalism.\" The speech helped popularize the term, and it attracted the attention of a number of Black leaders, including McKissick, who met with Nixon the next month. McKissick didn't endorse Nixon in 1968, but he wrote a series of cautiously optimistic columns in the Amsterdam News , a Black weekly newspaper, saying that he expected Nixon to \"make many changes for the good of Black People.\" He also issued a warning: \"If Nixon talks Black Capitalism, he must deliver.\"\n\nTwo years after buying the land, McKissick finally moved to North Carolina, with his wife, Evelyn, and his teen-age daughter, Charmaine. They had been living in Harlem, and McKissick still carried himself like a big-city power broker, even when he was living in a construction trailer parked next to a cornfield. A few years later, driving from Soul City to the local airport, he was involved in a serious car accident. Charmaine tells Healy that, when she went to see her father in the hospital, he feigned outrage over what the first responders had done to his Yves Saint Laurent outfit. \"Doodlebug, they fucked up my suit,\" he told her.\n\nHealy's book provides only brief glimpses of McKissick's personality-just enough to convey the impression that his grand project brought him more sorrow than joy. From the start, Soul City attracted plenty of media coverage, much of it critical. (From the Baltimore Sun: \"The chasm dividing the present dream from the future reality could hardly be greater if Mr. McKissick intended to build this city on the moon.\") But its existence, even in a preliminary form, was a tangible example of Black capitalism under Nixon, and so in late 1971, when McKissick had trouble getting loans from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, he wrote to a friend in the Administration that he was prepared to switch sides from Democrat to Republican, and to publicly back Nixon's 1972 reëlection campaign. The offer was accepted, and McKissick became an enthusiastic Nixon surrogate, giving the keynote address at a lively gathering of Black Nixon supporters who included Betty Shabazz, the widow of Malcolm X, and the jazz musician Lionel Hampton, who performed an original composition, \"We Need Nixon.\" The song seems to have been less memorable than McKissick's speech, in which he compared the Democratic Party to a \"sugar tit,\" a baby's pacifier that offered temporary succor but no nutrition. \"I've tasted a little bit of cream and a little bit of milk,\" McKissick said. \"There's food in the land-it's goodbye old sugar tit!\"\n\nNot long afterward, McKissick secured a pair of government grants for Soul City: half a million dollars toward the construction of an industrial park, and a million toward a health-care center. In July, 1972, the federal government agreed to guarantee fourteen million dollars of Soul City's debt, for infrastructure improvements, like road paving and electrification, meant to lure businesses. Healy suggests that McKissick deserved these grants, but he also concedes that McKissick was selling his political loyalty, at the same moment that the Nixon Administration was looking to buy some.\n\nMcKissick was not mentioned in the Senate's 1974 Watergate report, but it documented the existence of what was known within the White House as the Responsiveness Program. One memo, from 1972, called for \"incentives for Black individuals, firms, and organizations whose support will have a multiplier effect on Black vote support for the President.\" Another hailed the existence of \"an excellent group of visible Blacks\" who had received funding as part of the program. During the 1972 campaign, McKissick was indeed unusually \"visible.\" He gave speeches on the importance of liberating Black voters from Democratic \"captivity,\" and the Nixon campaign published an advertisement featuring Soul City: \"Democrats endorsed it. Republicans supported it. That's Action.\" After Nixon was reëlected, George H. W. Bush, who was then in charge of the Republican National Committee, suggested that McKissick was helping to change the image of the G.O.P.\n\nLink copied\n\nEven with the President on its side, though, Soul City faced extraordinary political opposition. Newspaper articles noted that, despite lots of federal money, the town still hadn't sprung to life; the Government Accountability Office hunted for corruption and impropriety, though it found nothing worse than occasional incompetence. Matters weren't helped when, in 1972, a former Democrat named Jesse Helms won a North Carolina race for the U.S. Senate-as a Republican, although with no help from McKissick, who declined to endorse a candidate. Helms was known for his hostility to the civil-rights movement, and he told McKissick, \"I do not favor the expenditure of taxpayers' funds for the project known as 'Soul City.' \"\n\nIt isn't clear that McKissick was wasting taxpayer money, but the idea was hard to refute, especially when Soul City consisted mainly of a health clinic, a few shops, a cluster of trailers, and some upgraded utilities. McKissick's support for Nixon wasn't much of an asset after Nixon's resignation, and his Republicanism, however nominal, was even less helpful after the election, in 1976, of Jimmy Carter, a Democrat who was sympathetic to civil rights but not particularly interested in Soul City. At one point, McKissick even considered changing the name, which he loved, as a way of making his town more appealing to white corporations and tenants. (A report commissioned by HUD had found that the name had \"a negative connotation\" for white people.) HUD finally foreclosed on the property in May, 1980, leaving McKissick Enterprises with a small fraction of the land and some mortgages to pay. He rejoined the Democratic Party and lived quietly as a trial lawyer and, after a late-in-life divinity degree, a preacher; he died from lung cancer, in 1991, aged sixty-nine. Today, in the former future home of Soul City, there is not much to see besides a medium-security prison-a planned community but in no sense a utopia.\n\nOne of the people who helped plan Soul City was a young Black architect named Harvey Gantt, who later became the mayor of Charlotte, and who twice ran for the Senate as a Democrat against Helms, unsuccessfully. Talking to Healy, Gantt says that when he thinks of Soul City he sometimes wonders, \"Why did I think that was going to succeed?\" In defense of McKissick's vision, Healy points out that Soul City was not unusually troubled: HUD funded thirteen new towns, only one of which endures today-the Woodlands, a majority-white outlying suburb of Houston. It is impossible to disprove the contention that, with sufficient government investment, Soul City might have thrived. (With sufficient support, just about any settlement might succeed.) But the promise of Black capitalism was a promise of independence, a promise that Black people could run their own businesses and make their own rules. What McKissick learned was that, for a Black leader in nineteen-seventies America, begging Republicans for money was not necessarily more rewarding, or less humiliating, than begging Democrats for money. One can imagine a world in which a Black planned community in North Carolina would be met with widespread enthusiasm and generous federal funding. But in that world many other government programs might look much more feasible, too, and McKissick might not have had cause to complain about the \"sugar tit\" of the Democratic Party. In that world, he might not have felt moved to create a new city at all.\n\nThere is a paradox at the heart of \"Black capitalism,\" two words that pull in opposite directions, toward both community-mindedness and individual striving. When Du Bois proposed \"economic emancipation through voluntary determined cooperative effort,\" a slogan not designed with placards in mind, he was simultaneously embracing the private sector and urging it to be more public-spirited. And, of course, Soul City, even in theory, turned out to be something less than an archetype of Black capitalism. Because the settlement relied on HUD funding, it was prohibited from discriminating against any potential resident. In other words, McKissick could not accurately say that his city would be unambiguously capitalist, or unambiguously Black.\n\nAside from Soul City, Nixon's major Black-capitalist initiative was the creation, in 1969, of the Office of Minority Business Enterprise, which is now known as the Minority Business Development Agency, and which functions as a kind of internal lobbying group. (In December, the incoming Biden Administration said that it was going to direct the M.B.D.A. to \"coordinate all federal offices to reduce barriers to procurement for underrepresented groups, including all types of minority-owned businesses.\") The modesty of Nixon's efforts to support Black capitalism made the term itself sound rather cynical, especially once his various schemes had been exposed.\n\nBut the entrepreneurial spirit Nixon identified really did exist-there was a reason that, in 1968, \"Black capitalism\" seemed like an appealing political slogan. It was a time when many corporations were scrambling to appear supportive of social change, and many activists were trying to decide what to make of them. In a recent book titled \"Franchise,\" the historian Marcia Chatelain chronicles how McDonald's reacted to protests and urban unrest in the nineteen-sixties: by recruiting Black franchisees, who in 1972 came together to found the National Black McDonald's Operators Association. It still exists, and calls itself \"the largest organization of established African American entrepreneurs in the world.\" If Black capitalism works, then this is how: not through high-profile government initiatives but through trade groups that most people have never heard of-Black capitalists quietly helping one another make money.\n\nOne of the oddest things about Black capitalism is that its major proponents have generally emerged from the world of activism, not of capitalism. Madam C. J. Walker, who built an empire of beauty products in the nineteen-tens, was among the most celebrated Black entrepreneurs of the twentieth century and a strong supporter of civil rights, but she did not generally speak the language of Black capitalism. If \"Black capitalist\" described her life, it did not necessarily describe her ideology. George and Joan Johnson were the founders of Johnson Products, the first Black-owned company to be listed on the American Stock Exchange (in 1971), but they, too, seemed more interested in practicing Black capitalism than in preaching it. Even apparently sympathetic politicians have often declined to wave the banner of Black capitalism. \"Black capitalism is not our panacea,\" Maynard Jackson, the vice-mayor of Atlanta, declared at a National Urban League conference in 1970. Three years later, he was elected the city's first Black mayor, and he helped establish Atlanta as a Black business hub-the real Soul City, you might say. And some community groups, like the Harlem Commonwealth Council, prospered by helping draw businesses to preëxisting Black communities. By contrast, the avowed Black capitalists have sometimes produced more inspiration than enrichment. Floyd McKissick once wrote that Marcus Garvey, despite his \"financial failure,\" had done a lot for \"Black pride and cohesiveness.\" Healy writes a similar encomium to McKissick near the end of his book, lauding his \"vision and courage.\" He dreamed big, and he went bust. Perhaps that, too, is Black capitalism.\n\nWhat is the alternative? Last summer, amid the protests for racial justice, sharp criticism of capitalism was common. But so were efforts to celebrate and support Black businesses, and demands for corporations to promote more Black executives. Some activists criticized \"white capitalism,\" a crafty formulation that McKissick probably would have appreciated, because it leaves open the possibility that non -white capitalism deserves support. At the same time, President Trump made a Nixonian pitch to Black voters, reminding them how well they had done under his Administration, at least until the pandemic.\n\nPaeans to Black capitalism are everywhere, even though the term has fallen out of favor. In 1971, Huey Newton argued that Black capitalists were more trustworthy than white capitalists, not because they were nobler but because they were weaker and poorer, and therefore had to be more accountable. \"If he wants to succeed in his enterprise,\" Newton wrote, \"the Black capitalist must turn to the community because he depends on them to make his profits.\" This formulation helps explain why ambitious Black capitalists have tended not to espouse Black capitalism: they know that in order to prosper they may have to grow less dependent on the Black community and more tightly integrated into the broader economy. Half a century after Nixon's campaign promise, it is still unclear how much the federal government can do to foster Black business ownership; in the world of entrepreneurship, as elsewhere, racial disparities have survived many attempted remedies. But there seems to be broad agreement that we should celebrate the achievements of Black entrepreneurs and executives, no matter which communities they serve. This, after all, is the promise of capitalism, and often the reality: it makes us less separate, while also making us less equal. The world it creates does not resemble a utopia-unless, of course, you compare it with the world that came before. ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "The Necessary Vote\n\nOn the morning of Nov. 7, Nicolas O'Rourke was sitting in his home office in Philadelphia trying to get some work done. As the organizing director for the Pennsylvania Working Families Party was catching up on emails, with his noise-canceling AirPods placed snugly in his ears, he heard a rapid succession of thumps coming from the kitchen. His wife, the source of the ruckus, bolted down the hall to his office to tell him the reason: Pennsylvania had just been called for Joe Biden, flipping the state from red to blue and sealing Biden's victory in the 2020 election.\n\nFour years before, O'Rourke stayed up on election night to watch the results come in, then broke the news of Donald Trump's win to his wife the next morning. She'd wept at the news. This time, O'Rourke said, \"I felt the tension in my own chest just open up.\"\n\nBiden hadn't been O'Rourke's preferred candidate for the Democratic nomination, but the Pennsylvania Working Families Party, under O'Rourke's direction, had been working hard at a task that eventually brought about a change in administration. He said the group convinced more than 30,000 Philadelphians to commit to vote early or by mail, then followed up to make sure they actually did; its Vote Today PA program reached more than 101,000 voters to discuss early voting, and registered 2,916 people.\n\n\"Regardless of what you may feel about Joe Biden, in that moment, put him aside. This has been some dark four years,\" said O'Rourke. \"I think you feel that in your body, like, wow, we just shifted something.\"\n\nIn the first wave of election analysis, based on early returns and uncorrected exit polls, much of the credit for Biden's victory went to white suburban voters who had turned away from Trump or had turned out extra enthusiastically for Biden. Increased turnout among Black voters-whose decline in turnout from 2012 to 2016 had been blamed, unconvincingly , for contributing to Hillary Clinton's narrow Electoral College loss-was treated as unremarkable in an election with record-breaking overall numbers of votes cast; the New York Times' Upshot desk argued that even as Biden flipped Georgia from red to blue, Black voters' share of the state's electorate had declined .\n\nBut the specifics of that Georgia analysis, and the larger story of how Biden's victory took place, look different now. As slowly counted big-city votes accumulated and Biden's popular vote total surpassed 80 million-with margins in crucial swing states like Pennsylvania too large to be seriously endangered by Trump's frantic campaign of lawsuits-it has become clearer and clearer that the winning campaign was borne along on a robust infrastructure built by Black organizers and other organizers of color .\n\nIn interviews with Slate, Black organizers around the country describe a 2020 campaign that called for extraordinary mobilization-one capable of adapting to a life-threatening pandemic and accumulated voter suppression measures. Their efforts drew not just on the electoral frustrations of the past four years but on the greater movement against injustice that took over the streets in the spring and summer. As part of that broader, deeper activity, organizers say, they intend to press the party and the new administration to invest in Black communities at the local, state, and federal levels. Meaningful engagement between activists and regular voters made a difference, but the party needs to make a case for why such engagement should be maintained and expanded on its behalf.\n\n\"If they want to be a party that can win, this is a blueprint on how you win,\" said Cliff Albright, the co-founder of Black Voters Matter.\n\nGroups that animate Black voters are treating Biden's success as a direct result of their work. Thousands of volunteers executed extensive text and phone banking campaigns that reached millions of people. Election protection efforts ensured the folks who voted in person felt safe doing so. On-site volunteers made themselves available to answer questions about the voting process.\n\nMore specifically, the Poor People's Campaign contacted more than 3 million poor and low-wealth voters in this election. The Advancement Project focused on expanding political education, training young people to be spokespersons for causes of their choice, and promoting turnout for down-ballot races such as sheriff and district attorney. And Black Voters Matter orchestrated \"the kinds of events that you wound up eventually seeing the Biden campaign doing,\" said Albright.\n\nBlack Voters Matter caravans led voters to polling places, while organizers set up events in parking lots and planned socially distanced tailgates. The group also hosted drive-in movie screenings about issues around voting, scheduled virtual town halls, and executed a 38-day bus tour across 12 states. The final days of the tour were spent driving across Georgia, where their most robust program is housed, spending considerable amounts of time in counties-including Dougherty, Chatham, and Clayton-where mail-in ballots handed Biden a definitive statewide lead.\n\nAll of this happened in the midst of a coronavirus outbreak that has been disproportionately fatal to Black people, and which disrupted the usual means of voting and prevented Democratic campaigns from canvassing door-to-door. \"We had to find a way to keep up the same kind of excitement that we would [have] normally,\" said Albright.\n\nThe long-standing story of the Democratic Party's engagement with Black communities is about expectations. The party counts on Black voters to turn out for the Democrats in droves on Election Day-even if the presidential candidate hasn't visited the state or the House candidate has assumed the base will remain theirs even though they don't live in the district full time . The party has relied on the Black community's historically rooted sense of duty to vote, as well as a widespread desire to reduce harm, in order to secure wins despite a stunning lack of investment in said community. This includes down-ballot races, particularly those in red states where Democrats have essentially ceded districts to the GOP.\n\nThis reliability can leave the Black electorate in a bind. When Democrats lose, as in 2016, postmortems say that Black voters didn't come through for them. When Democrats win, though, swing voters usually get the credit. The incoming Biden administration has promised to have the Black community's back, but organizers have learned to expect politicians to lose interest in their most loyal voters in between elections.\n\nFor a multiracial coalition party like the Democrats, the Black vote can't ever be sufficient on its own to win a presidential election. But for Biden, energetic Black turnout was necessary. Regardless of how the intra-analyst dispute over Georgia's vote-share numbers is resolved, Biden won the state by less than 13,000 votes, which represents a tiny fraction of the increased Black turnout. In the absence of those Black voters, Trump would have carried Georgia.\n\n\"The reality is that Black voters consistently show up and deliver in crucial elections, pulling overall Democrat support, and anchoring turnout,\" Adrianne Shropshire, the executive director of BlackPAC, wrote in an email. \"Even in the face of blatant voter suppression-before Election Day, on Election Day, and even during the post-election vote counting-and sustained disinformation and propaganda campaigns, Black voters rallied and found a way to cast their ballots.\"\n\nThe Republican Party, for its part, has made it clear how it views the importance of the Black vote. Rudy Giuliani's desperate legal campaign to overturn the presidential result largely ignored the suburban surge for Biden to focus on demanding that hundreds of thousands of votes from majority Black jurisdictions be thrown out. \"It changes the result of the election in Michigan, if you take out Wayne County,\" Giuliani argued at a press conference on Thursday.\n\nThe debate over the relative contributions of Black voters and white suburban ones fails to reflect the systemic barriers designed to reduce Black vote share. It's a distraction from the question of who \"the power players are,\" said Jamira Burley, a New York-based activist who works on political strategies.\n\n\"It's easier to encourage white folks who have access to institutional power-whether we're talking about the voting booth or we're talking about housing or we're talking about representation within other institutions-for them to see how their power plays in the grand scheme of things,\" said Burley. \"But when you're talking about Black folks who not only are going to face discrimination in the ability to access the vote, they [also] haven't seen in many ways how fighting through those barriers are beneficial to their community.\"\n\nWhile the external barriers that prevent Black access to the ballot box are known, the internal battles are less discussed. Centuries of voter disenfranchisement have fueled legitimate fears about the risks of voting and whether to trust that one's ballot will be counted. This year, long lines, a commonplace suppression tactic, came with the additional worry of exposure to the coronavirus. During this year's primaries, thousands of Black voters reported that they did not receive an absentee ballot , and in some states , these ballots are more likely to be rejected. And the Trump administration's attempts to undermine the U.S. Postal Service didn't assuage this trepidation.\n\nThese shenanigans, according to Burley, could have driven turnout down in 2020, were intensive organizing not in place to counteract them.\n\nWhen Black Voters Matter heard concerns about mail voting in their voter outreach conversations, they were accommodating of people's fears and talked it through with them. If a voter couldn't be convinced to mail in their ballot, the Black Voters Matter team would walk them through the early voting process in their state. And if that wasn't an option, they would talk through preparations for voting on Election Day. The result was historic levels of turnout.\n\n\"We've got a fundamental belief that if you want folks to take action, if you want folks to respond to you, you've got to be in relationship with them,\" Albright said. \"And show that you hear them and affirm their lived experience. So when people tell us that they have concerns about the vote by mail process or about voting in general, we can't just gloss that over.\"\n\n\"You have to meet folks where they are,\" he said.\n\nMeeting voters where they were was of equal importance to Kendra Brooks, a Working Families Party member on the Philadelphia City Council. Her strategy for engaging Black voters began during her 2019 campaign for council when she focused on potential voters who didn't feel as if their ballot mattered because they believed the system to be rigged.\n\n\"A lot of people felt that. That's why people don't vote,\" said Brooks. \" 'I'm going to elect another person who's going to come into my community, and think they know better than I do, and make all these promises, and don't deliver-year after year.' That's how we ended up where we are now.\"\n\n\"I had to tell them, if I win this election that's proof that every vote matters,\" she continued. \"And now that you know your vote matters, I need you to show up again in 2020.\"\n\nIn that election, and in this one, her team prioritized voter education and highlighted her plans to address the specific issues the community cared about: housing, education, and inequitable access to medical care. Such work was necessary to combat the apathy sparked by lack of appreciation of Black voters by the Democrats. By doing this, Brooks won her election.\n\n\"When you're playing on the margins,\" said O'Rourke, \"you need to know what the marginalized people want to see happen for them and for their communities, [and] what they expect from their elected officials.\"\n\nBiden was not the first choice for people hoping to see the political system transformed. But his status as the consensus \"Well, he's better than Trump\" candidate gave organizers a chance to rally Black voters who were disillusioned with the electoral process.\n\n\"In many of the conversations that I was able to have with Black folks who realized that Biden was not their No. 1 candidate, they showed up because he represented a moral ground that they were trying to establish by voting against Donald Trump,\" said Burley.\n\nSince the beginning of his presidency, Trump and his administration preoccupied themselves with committing human rights violations and upending civil rights protections. An onslaught of nefarious and targeted attacks on queer folks have focused, primarily, on repealing protections afforded to transgender people . An immigration ban targeting Muslim countries preceded a cruel family separation policy that was instituted in 2018, leading to children being split from their parents and forced to live in abhorrent conditions . He refused to punish China for its human rights violations against the Uighur people because he didn't want to damage trade talks. His refusal to initiate a comprehensive federal pandemic response has allowed the novel coronavirus to run unchecked , which has led to more than 260,000 deaths-disproportionately of Black Americans, the same demographic that has borne the brunt of crackdowns on protests and the bolstering of the police.\n\nThe ledger persists and so does the pushback against it. Political change has rested on the shoulders of those willing to make good trouble for as long as America has existed. Numerous movements-such as the Women's March, the Sunrise Movement, the March for Our Lives, Demand Justice, the Yellowhammer Fund-sprang up in response to the sweeping human rights injustices posed by the administration. And the groups that existed prior deftly shifted their infrastructure toward getting Black voters to the polls. Over the summer, after the death of George Floyd, a wave of anti-racism protests swept the country and brought more people along for the ride.\n\nTo centrists, that energy was not necessarily a good thing. Despite Biden's success at the top of the ticket, the election left the Democrats with a badly diminished House majority and needing a sweep of the Georgia runoffs to break Republicans' hold on the Senate. Disappointed Democratic moderates quickly settled on the claim that calls to \"defund the police\" had been a detriment to the movement and undermined the campaigns of moderate Democratic candidates.\n\n\"Politicians and pundits who blame Democratic losses on the call for 'Medicare for All' and defunding the police are wrong,\" said the Rev. William Barber, co-chair of the Poor People's Campaign. \"The top of the ticket won in every area of the country by running on [a minimum wage of] $15 an hour, health care expansion, and addressing systemic racism. All Democrats should have been running on these three things, at least.\n\n\"Some Democrats lost because they are not expanding their language, vision, or voice to reach poor and low-wealth voters who now represent almost 30 percent of the electorate,\" he continued, adding that Democrats should center their agendas around addressing the issues that pain their constituents.\n\nAlbright was more direct: \"Be a better candidate.\"\n\n\"The thought that issues like defund or any other racial justice issue scared off people flies in the face of what we saw,\" said Albright. \"If it was so hurtful for the moderates, then how did Joe Biden win some of those same states where those moderates lost? So that's a question that they got to deal with. At the end of the day, no matter how you peel it back, it's going to boil down to the same thing: If you lost your race as a moderate, then you needed to be a better moderate.\"\n\nThe numbers back up the idea that the problems for moderates were the moderates' own inability to generate excitement, rather than fallout from a vigorous national racial-justice campaign. Ninety-two percent of those who voted for Biden said racial inequality was an issue of concern to them, ranking it higher than any other issue considered in the 2020 exit polling.\n\n\"My question would be: What movement are these centrists referring to?\" said Brooks. \"Because where I live, if you talk to young people in my neighborhood, they are very clear that we need to completely rethink how we are policing our neighborhoods. And the young people in my neighborhood could be the future of the Democratic Party-if the Democratic Party stops alienating young voters of color.\"\n\nIn the same districts where some of these moderates lost, a progressive won another race. In Democratic Rep. Joe Cunningham's South Carolina district, a progressive candidate for sheriff beat out a 32-year incumbent. In Georgia, a progressive district attorney secured a win in Savannah. Over in Brunswick, the district attorney who was initially assigned to the case of Ahmaud Arbery, whose death helped fuel the summer's uprising, lost their bid for reelection . Despite what centrists claim, energy from the movement has created victories.\n\nWhat Black organizers and voters want in return is straightforward: investment in the neighborhoods they mobilized and insurance that the issues those communities care about will be addressed by the Biden administration-including restoring and expanding voting rights, alleviating student loan debt, addressing disparate health outcomes, and delivering COVID-19 relief that specifically responds to the disproportionate impact of the virus on Black communities. The Democrats could sidestep their deference to moderate legislation and pass transformative policing policies, provide health care for all, and fully fund public education.\n\nIt's the bare minimum the party could offer.\n\n\"For a long time, the Democratic Party has taken Black voters for granted because we've always had to choose the lesser of two evils,\" said Brooks. \"Over the past five years, there has been a new wave in the movement for Black liberation-and that movement is demanding more for Black people. We are demanding that our communities are resourced, our people have the right to live, that we have access to full employment and affordable accessible housing and the highest quality schools, that we have clean air and a Green New Deal that employs millions of people.\"\n\n\"When Black people have communities that thrive,\" said Brooks, \"all people will thrive.\"\n\nThe desires and requests from the most reliable voters in the Democratic coalition are within the realm of possibility. But organizers warn that Black voters are already wary of a party that doesn't reliably deliver for them, and if the Democrats skirt their responsibility to come through after this campaign, the base may be even more reluctant in the future. Still, no matter if the Democrats keep their promises or not, the organizers who have always had the community's interests at heart will continue to do the work. Black folks take care of one another when institutions won't. No administration changes that for the people on the ground.\n\n\"If they don't step up more, then we are going to expand what we do,\" said Albright. \"One way or another ... we are going to support our communities in building power. And either the Democratic Party can learn from it, and try to replicate the strategies that we use, or they can just keep doing what they're doing-in which case they're gonna have to get out of the way.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Why Biden's Gaza Policy Is Alienating Black Voters\n\nThis article was originally featured in Foreign Policy, the magazine of global politics and ideas. For news, expert analysis, and background on the conflict, read FP's latest coverage of the Israel-Hamas war .﻿\n\nFor decades, despite the diverse politics of the Black community, addressing Black voters' concerns with racial and economic domestic issues was enough to solidify the Black American vote behind the Democratic Party. But this is changing. President Joe Biden's reluctance to call for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war-which has resulted in the deaths of more than 28,000 people in Gaza, over 150 strikes on U.S. troops in the Middle East, and in recent weeks the deaths of three Black service members in Jordan-is leading more and more Black voters to question their support for the president.\n\nIn the beginning of January, in an attempt to boost political morale among his most loyal constituency, Biden made an appearance at the Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina-where nine Black Americans were gunned down by a white supremacist shooter in 2015. At this sacred site, it was fitting that Biden spoke about domestic issues such as racism and political violence. Unfortunately, Biden's foreign-policy woes followed him to the pulpit, where he was interrupted by protesters demanding a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nChurches like Mother Emanuel AME play a key role in shaping the voting decisions of the larger Black community. More and more members of the clergy are speaking out from the pulpit against Biden's support for Israel. A recent New York Times article revealed that over the past several months more than 1,000 Black pastors-ranging from conservative Southern Baptist churches to progressive nondenominational congregations in the Midwest and Northeast-have called for an end to Israel's offensive operations in Gaza as well as the release of all hostages held by Hamas. As in other parts of the American public , much of the momentum behind Black faith leaders' calls for a cease-fire is coming from younger congregants.\n\nTHE GROWING DISCONTENTMENT with Biden's handling of the conflict was in some ways foreseeable. A Carnegie Endowment for International Peace survey of Black American opinion on the conflict conducted in October 2023, long before the death toll in Gaza had mounted, already revealed that 95 percent of Black Americans rejected the idea of \"unwavering support\" for Israel. Furthermore, while most Black Americans (65 percent) did not feel any worse about Biden in this early period of the conflict, Black Americans under the age of 30 were 33 percent more likely to report feeling worse about the president compared to the rest of respondents.\n\nAs one pastor in the swing state of Georgia stated, \"It's going to be very hard to persuade our people to go back to the polls and vote for Biden.\" This comes on the heels of polling that reveals that Black voters' approval rating for Biden in recent months is down nearly 20 percentage points. It is more and more difficult to view the mounting number of civilian deaths and worsening humanitarian crisis in Gaza as being in line with the human rights commitments Biden ran on in 2020.\n\nThe dip in enthusiasm for Biden is in part related to a feeling of Black-Palestinian solidarity among some of these disaffected Black voters. For others, lackluster support for Biden could also be a function of a limited appetite for yet another U.S. entanglement in the Middle East. For instance, the same Carnegie survey revealed that a quarter (24 percent) of Black respondents felt that the United States should not be involved in the Israel-Palestine conflict and that only 33 percent would be willing to send troops to the region if Israel is attacked by a neighboring state.\n\nIt is fair to assume that the death of three Black service members in a drone attack near the Syria-Jordan border will conjure strong feelings about Biden's Middle East posture and the perennial human and material costs placed upon the Black American community in wartime.\n\nBlack American news outlets such as the Amsterdam News , the Root , and Black Enterprise were quick to note that the three service members killed were Black. On social media outlets such as X, many Black Americans are now wondering what the strategic purpose was for those soldiers being stationed there in the first place, and if Biden will be able to prevent more deaths of U.S. troops in an area where the United States is not actively at war.\n\nHigh rates of Black American military service , alongside the recent memory of the post-9/11 wars (which carried a price tag of $8 trillion ), will weigh heavily on the minds of Black voters as they grapple with economic and racial issues domestically. If a community in which so many people have close relatives on active duty comes to believe that Biden's Middle East policy has led to increased attacks on U.S. troops (a point numerous pundits have come to argue), it is likely that this will influence Black voters-many of whom have historically shown high levels of reticence toward the use of force abroad and see parallels to their own historic struggle for civil rights.\n\nAS ELECTION SEASON APPROACHES, the Biden administration's well-timed appearances at fish fries, churches, historically Black colleges and universities, and Black sorority and fraternity events will not be enough to secure the Black vote-as it did in 2020. This is especially true if the humanitarian crisis in Gaza continues to deteriorate before November.\n\nRecent statements by Black members of Biden's Cabinet, such as Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, speaking out against Israel's handling of military operations in Gaza can be understood as an attempt to address those troubled by the worsening humanitarian situation in the region and to salvage Biden's reputation as a champion of human rights, a key component of his platform in the 2020 election. However, such statements will be for naught if members of the Black community do not see a change in Middle East policy.\n\nSince the turn of the century, Black American public opinion on U.S. military engagements has often foreshadowed broader public discontentment with poor foreign-policy decisions. For instance, Black Americans were among the earliest and most vocal groups raising concerns about the 2003 Iraq war-now widely viewed as ill-fated. Unfortunately, foreign-policy experts have sometimes been slow to listen to Black American opinion on Washington's role in the world. If Biden is going to succeed in securing a second term, now is the time to do so.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The South Runs the Country\n\nSlate is hosting a weekly election live show, In the Know, every Monday at 1 p.m. on YouTube and Facebook. On Sept. 28, Slate staff writer Julia Craven talked to LaTosha Brown, the co-founder of Black Voters Matter. The two discussed BVM's voter outreach efforts, the importance of animating Black voters, and why the South has the most impact on American policy.\n\nPart of their conversation, edited and condensed for clarity, can be read below.\n\nNext Tuesday, Mark Joseph Stern will interview Leah Litman, assistant professor of law at the University of Michigan and co-host of the podcast Strict Scrutiny . We hope to see you there! In the meantime, you can watch the most recent episode where Noreen Malone chats with Cecile Richards, women's rights activist and former president of Planned Parenthood.\n\nJulia Craven: What is the importance of the South? Because I think the South is fascinating for a number of reasons as far as voting goes, but why is it important to focus on the South, outside of the fact that that is where most Black people in the country live?\n\nLaTosha Brown: I'm telling everybody who's watching this right now, welcome to the South, because guess who's setting policy for this country right now? It is the South. Who runs the Senate right now ? Let's talk about who is the majority leader in the Senate right now. Let's talk about Lindsey Graham and Mitch McConnell, who are both from the South.\n\nYou can be as blue as you want to be in California, you can be as blue as you want to be and progressive as you want to be in New York, but right now the policy priorities for this nation are being led by senators of the South, who set up a system where they have an enormous amount of power. They've taken on the Southern Strategy, which was to create this whole notion of agitating white fear, also to marginalize, to racialize the elections, and to marginalize the power of the Black vote. That is a quintessential blueprint from the Southern Strategy. It's been expanded to America.\n\nThe South is literally directing, running, making the priorities for this entire nation. And so, when we think about what is a financial center in America, we think about Wall Street, right? If I say, \"Well, where is the policy center?\" people will say D.C. When I say, \"Where is the entertainment center?\" people will say Hollywood. \"When I say white patriarchal racism,\" structurally the capital of that has been in the South. So, if this country is to be progressive to move forward? As goes the South, goes the nation. If we have not learned that in any critical moment in time, we should know it now. It was not by accident that Trump's very first rally, when he decided to run for office, was in Mobile, Alabama. I'm raising that because we have to also see how there have been bad actors and there have been racist Republicans who are rooted in the South who are now actually running the policy in this entire country. So the reason why you should care about the South is because the South is making decisions for each of you.\n\nA daily email update of the stories you need to read right now.\n\nHow would you advise people who hear that? Because we know that people have the misconception that racism only exists down South. How would you advise people to take the South more seriously in terms of politics and that they consider the Southern Strategy whenever they're thinking about these things, but don't brush off the racism that occurs in the rest of the country?\n\nRacism is equally distributed in this country. So while there are [Southerners] in political power that use race as a vehicle, fundamentally we've got to be honest about structural racism, from the very foundations of this country, has existed and continues to exist. Which is why we saw uprisings and we saw protests not just in Southern states. We saw it in all 50 states because racism exists in all 50 states.\n\nWhen we're having a conversation around the South, there's a couple of things we can look at. One, the South is usually very instructive. My partner, Cliff Albright, always talks about the \"Petri dish\" and always talks about how a lot of what we see happen all around the country sometimes is first tested in the South. And then you start seeing those same kinds of laws pop up all over the country-from voter ID to the closing of polling sites, all those things. And it's important because I think that that strategy that was a part of the Southern Strategy has now been adopted as a national strategy for the Republican Party, and that impacts all of us.\n\nAlso, if we can look at the South in terms of being instructive around voter suppression, we can also look at the South as being instructive around how do you resist and how do people organize. I remember in 2017 in Alabama, in the Doug Jones race, that Senate seat was held by the Republican Party, which had been deeply disconnected and actually, quite frankly, had been aggressively working against the Black community, particularly to suppress our vote, for over 20 years. Here it is in this race where Black women and the organizing of Black women came in and made a difference. I'm raising that because I think that it's important that we don't just keep saying this state is blue or this state is red. The South is only red until it ain't.\n\nThere are organizations and groups that are doing work in the South that, if they are supported, if they're invested in-we also have to tell the story of resistance, not just the story of suppression.\n\nI'm glad you mentioned 2017 in Alabama, because I was certainly going to ask you about that. And I'm also glad that you brought up Black women. I interviewed Errin Haines a couple months ago, and one thing she said was that when a Black woman votes, it's not just her going to the polls, she's bringing her church with her, she's bringing her cousins, she's bringing her kids. She's bringing her community with her. And so I also just wanted to get your thoughts on that because I thought it was a very well-put way to describe how I've always seen Black women interact with voting.\n\nAbsolutely. The other piece, too, is I think that Black women have a unique experience in this country, that we literally stand at the intersection of what I think are the biggest sins of this country, racism and sexism. We literally sit squarely at the intersection of racism and sexism. And even in the midst of that, we've been able to be on the vanguard of change and pushing for change and democracy in this territory, even when others didn't stand with us.\n\nI can go back to the women's suffrage movement. It grew out of the abolitionist movement, which folks don't know. A lot of the abolitionists were the ones that were the founders of this conversation around suffrage. And so, from the women's suffrage movement, you had our white women counterparts who we stood with, and we fought for suffrage because we knew that to extend the right to vote for any of us actually advances democracy for all of us. However, even though we stood on the vanguard, we did not receive our right to vote until 50 years later.\n\nWe showed up consistently, but it has been around how we strengthen democracy. And we continue to show up. Not only do we bring our families and our communities to the table, and consistently engage in the process-we also have been thought leaders around this. We've got a 100-year track history of speaking against sexism, of speaking against racism, of literally working to push democracy.\n\nPart of it is a culture with Black women in the Black community. We understand what is critical and what is at stake, which is why we show up more than any other constituency in this country. Black women have been on the vanguard, and I do believe that is because there's a unique space we occupy. And we've had to learn how to navigate against those who wouldn't even recognize our humanity, against those who sought to marginalize us.\n\nWe had the courage and demonstrated the courage to step into the space of power because that's all we had. We had each other, and we had to organize and stand into that power. So that's why I think Black women are critical in this.\n\nWe have been consistent.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "There's a Lot of Fighting Over Why Harris Lost. But Everyone Seems to Want to Avoid This Explanation.\n\nWatching Kamala Harris run for president against Donald Trump felt like watching the world's most difficult game of Frogger : His dogged commitment to irrationality and ugliness-and the loyalty it inspired in his followers-was the incessant traffic of cars and river logs that the Harris campaign had to duck and dodge to avoid. We knew that it would take strategy, organization, and financial support to make it to the other side intact. Harris had all those things, despite the fact that she entered the race at the eleventh hour, as if she were (proverbially) starting the game on her last life. Still, in the wee hours of Wednesday morning, news broke that Harris had become froggy roadkill. And the loss was so stunning, it felt like Game Over for the long-held dream of so many. The sad truth is: It feels pretty clear that we just lost our only chance at ever having a Black woman as president.\n\nForget competent and qualified (our electorate certainly has); no woman was ever as primed to win the big prize as the sitting vice president. It's not just that she is comparatively more sane than her opponent, not to mention less offensive and willing to charm voters by going on podcasts like Call Her Daddy . It's not just that she lacked the 1990s political baggage that plagued Hillary Clinton's campaign. It's not just that she was running against an unhinged demagogue who infamously already presided over this nation during a uniquely chaotic time in American history that ended with a devastating pandemic-which he completely mishandled, becoming one of the world's leading sources of dangerous health-related misinformation. I could go on, but it wouldn't matter. It didn't matter. When faced with the options of chaos, greed, and anger or relative common sense-the kind wielded by a competent, qualified Black woman-voters overwhelmingly chose the former. It wasn't the fascism-loving guy who spurred an insurrection whom they couldn't trust. It was the Black woman.\n\nOne of Harris' biggest weapons in this race was her membership in Alpha Kappa Alpha, the sorority she pledged as a student at historically Black college Howard University, a particularly tenacious Black community that moves mountains, breaks barriers, and looks good doing it. It's sage Black wisdom that the devil works hard, but AKAs work harder. Harris' experience and political savvy, formed by one of the most influential of the \"Divine Nine\" Black sororities and fraternities governed by the National Pan-Hellenic Council, is a large part of why many Black constituents felt confident that Harris could be the one to pull this off.\n\nThe ladies of Alpha Kappa Alpha have a different ethos than the rest of the Divine Nine. More than any other historically Black sorority, AKAs are focused on increasing and preserving Black \"social stature\" (as it is worded in their five basic tenets ). There's a lot under the tip of that iceberg: Most historically Black Greek organizations have purpose statements that include a focus on \"economic growth.\" But AKA's reference to \"social stature\" is slightly different. It's not just about leadership, status, wealth, or power. It is also about appearance, politeness, and respectability. And historically, for Black people, that involves making oneself or one's presence adjacent to whiteness.\n\nEtiquette and presentability are a performance for anyone, but they are concepts created and defined by white people in this country. For many upwardly mobile Black Americans, getting white approval is still necessary for success. Thus, it's unsurprising that AKAs have a long-standing reputation for having predominantly lighter-skinned women in their ranks, for showcasing silk-pressed hairstyles over natural curls. The double-edged sword of achieving powerful social status as a marginalized person in American society is the assimilation necessary to accomplish it. Rest assured, no one fit that bill more than Kamala Harris.\n\nTo put it bluntly: If Harris was considered too Black to be our first Black female president, then, welp! I suppose there goes that dream. She looked the part, in pantsuits and pearls (a signature AKA sorority accessory). She acted the part: Even in college, she was known as C 3 , for being calm, cool, and collected . She refused to make her identity as a Black, South Asian American central to the campaign, after seeing what running on identity had done for Clinton just eight years earlier. And while maintaining an extremely controlled image, Harris was also wildly qualified, having served as a vice president, U.S. senator, and attorney general of California.\n\nAnd if s ecuring the Black vote and Black capital was the only thing Harris needed for this campaign, she would have achieved it in a business day. Within 24 hours of her endorsement as the Democratic presidential candidate, Black women fundraised an unprecedented number of campaign dollars and broke Zoom capacity records and began to push huge get-out-the-vote efforts . Much of this was led by sorority and fraternity members of the Divine Nine, and to call the Divine Nine \"organized\" is an understatement. Organizing is not only what they are best at, it is what they trade in.\n\nBut taking a page from the white collegiates and utilizing our own secret societies wasn't enough to convince the rest of the populace in just 107 short days. Harris-backed not just by powerful Black institutions with money and status and the will to get shit done, but by celebrities, party leaders, Democrats, lapsed Republicans, and an ungodly amount of campaign cash-fell short.\n\nThere has already been much infighting over what lost Harris the election, about demographics and trust in the system, about running an uninspiring platform against a fascist one, about the economy and inflation resentment. But the deepest truth cannot get lost in all of that: Unfortunately, this country will always default to its original tenets of racism and misogyny in the face of fear, frustration, or just plain dissatisfaction. It has never been more unclear what unified Democratic opposition to Trumpism should look like, but there is one very clear reality looking at us straight in the face. If Harris, the closest woman we had to a bridge between the Black and white vote, couldn't win in 2024, maybe no Black woman can.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Brian Kemp's Bid for Governor Depends on Erasing the Black Vote in Georgia\n\nOn Thursday evening, the election board of Randolph County, Georgia, met to discuss a startling proposal to eliminate three-fourths of the county's polling places months before the November election. A rural, impoverished, and predominantly black county, Randolph has just nine polling locations, all of which were open during the May primaries and July runoffs . The election board may soon shut down seven of them, including one in a precinct where about 97 percent of voters are black. Its plan would compel residents, many of whom have no car or access to public transit, to travel as much as 30 miles round trip to reach the nearest polling place.\n\nBecause of its history of racist voting laws, Randolph County was once required to seek federal permission before altering its election procedures. But after the Supreme Court gutted this oversight in 2013, the county was freed to crack down on the franchise. It is no coincidence that its election board chose this moment to shutter most of its polls: In November, the popular Democrat Stacey Abrams will compete for the governorship against Republican Brian Kemp, the current Georgia secretary of state. Kemp, who has devoted his time in office to a ruthless campaign of voter suppression, called upon Randolph County to abandon the plan when it spurred widespread outrage. That being said, the key figure in the Randolph County controversy is a Kemp ally who was handpicked by the secretary of state to close polls throughout Georgia.\n\nTo understand the brazen attack on black suffrage now occurring in Randolph County, it's important to remember that Georgia is in the midst of a seismic demographic shift. As whites cease to be the majority in more and more counties, Republicans have clung to power by disenfranchising minority voters. Kemp's opposition to the Randolph County plan marks the first time that he has adopted an affirmatively pro-suffrage stance. During his nearly eight years as secretary of state, Kemp engaged in mass voter purges , removing hundreds of thousands of voters from the rolls. State officials appear to have singled out black voters in targeted purges.\n\nKemp also canceled or suspended 35,000 voter registrations using Exact Match, a version of Kris Kobach's notorious Crosscheck program that compares registrants' information with motor vehicle and Social Security databases. If a single letter, space, or hyphen did not match the database information, the voter application was rejected. Black voters were eight times more likely than whites to have their registrations halted due to Exact Match.\n\nPerhaps most egregiously, Kemp launched an investigation into Abrams' efforts to register more minority voters despite no evidence of fraud. He used the probe to harass and intimidate voting rights advocates. Later, he refused to register 40,000 would-be voters who had signed up through the drive. Speaking to Republicans behind closed doors, Kemp explained the stakes: \"Registering all these minority voters that are out there ... if they can do that, they can win these elections.\" During Kemp's tenure, Georgia's population has increased substantially-yet the number of registered voters has actually gone down .\n\nIt should come as no surprise, then, that Kemp seems to have played a major role in the Randolph County poll closures. At the meeting on Thursday night, the election board revealed that the move had been encouraged by Mike Malone, an associate of Kemp's. Malone, who attended the meeting, explained that Kemp-who now claims that the poll closures are a bad idea-had asked him to go around the state and \"recommend polling place closures\" to various counties. Ten Georgia counties have already taken Malone's suggestions and closed polling places. All of those counties have large black populations.\n\nMalone has claimed that he chose which polls to close by gauging their compliance with the Americans With Disabilities Act. Rather than target certain communities, he merely advised election boards to shutter polling places that are not ADA compliant. Notably, many of these locations are government buildings that should already comply with ADA regulations. (Several polling places selected for closure in Randolph County, for instance, are fire stations.) But rather than direct counties to fix whatever ADA problems they might have, Malone simply suggested these locations be scrapped.\n\nAt Thursday's meeting, a county resident also asked Malone whether he had considered finding alternative polling places, like churches, that might be ADA compliant. Malone shot back that he was \"not hired to find alternatives.\" Another resident asked how much he was being paid for his consultant work. He refused to answer.\n\nSean J. Young, legal director of the Georgia chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, told me on Friday that he found Malone's answers disturbing.\n\n\"The purpose of this 'consultancy' is not to explore the best ways to serve the voters with polling places that are up to code,\" Young said. \"It's to shut down polling places. This alleged concern with ADA compliance is a total sham.\"\n\nYoung has already threatened to sue the county if it moves forward with Malone's plan, alleging that the poll closures would violate a remaining provision of the Voting Rights Act as well as the 14 th and 15 th amendments. He told me that the Georgia ACLU is \"demanding that the secretary of state immediately rescind his sponsorship\" of Malone and \"equip the counties to reverse the damage that he has already caused\" in other counties. Most importantly, though, he believes the Randolph County election board-which, thanks to a resignation, has just two members-\"needs to immediately reject this proposal.\" A vote is now scheduled for Aug. 24, though the board mulled postponing that vote at Thursday's meeting.\n\nKemp's decision to oppose Malone's proposal , a move he announced via a spokeswoman on Thursday night, represents a marked turn away from his policies of the past. (Abrams also denounced the plan, in much stronger language .) The secretary of state has not, however, disavowed Malone or his handiwork in 10 other counties with similarly diverse demographics. Kemp seems to have perceived the immense backlash spurred by early reports of the Randolph County closures and recognized that the scheme is indefensible.\n\nBut Kemp doesn't need to continue shuttering polling places to disenfranchise minority voters in November. He has spent eight years purging black voters from the rolls and canceling their registrations. Last-minute chicanery may be helpful to Kemp, but it probably isn't worth the publicity nightmare. It's possible he's already suppressed enough to votes to win himself four years in the governor's mansion, a perch he'd doubtless use to continue his erosion of democracy in Georgia.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Democrats Have a Latino Problem\n\nIf the Democratic Party is to regain control of Congress or win back the White House, it will need the support of women and minorities. Almost 7 out of 10 women who are registered to vote disapprove of Donald Trump's performance in office. The black vote will surely favor the Democratic Party as well. Only 10 percent of black voters support Trump. Then, there is the Hispanic vote. It would seem reasonable to assume that after three uninterrupted years of demonizing, ostracizing, and persecuting the country's Hispanic immigrants, Trump and his nativist enablers would have hell to pay with Latinos at the ballot box, come November and beyond. Trouble is, they might not. Hispanic voters have become a maddening puzzle for the Democratic Party.\n\n2016 was supposed to be the year America's great demographic \"sleeping giant\" would finally awake, shaken out of its slumber by Trump's rhetoric. Some predicted a massive \"We have arrived\" moment that would include a surge in voter registration and a dramatic increase in turnout at the polls. A \"Latino wave,\" an overoptimistic colleague told me, would come ashore and prove that Hispanic voters truly held the key to the White House.\n\nOn Election Day, the wave was merely a splash. There were certainly stories of accomplishment, like the Latino vote in Colorado and Nevada , but Hispanics did not reject Trump in the resounding, almost absolute way that, say, black Americans did . According to exit polls, Trump won 29 percent of the Hispanic vote, outperforming Mitt Romney's tally by 2 points.\n\nTwo things have happened since then. First, Trump's attacks on Hispanics immigrants have reached an astounding degree of cruelty. He has used the individual cases of gang members to demonize the wider population of hardworking immigrants who lead peaceful, unassuming lives in this country. He has turned the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency into a fearsome deportation machine . He has ended protection for Dreamers and separated immigrant families at the border. He has given men like Stephen Miller and Jeff Sessions free rein to execute their punitive fantasies.\n\nLatinos have not responded in kind. While Trump was enacting his anti-immigrant agenda, Latino voters seemed to have slowly warmed up to the president. In last week's NPR/PBS/Marist poll , 41 percent of Hispanics approved of Trump's performance (black Americans? 12 percent).  This is no outlier. Another recent poll put Trump's approval among Latinos at 35 percent. An average of both would put Trump-again, an overtly nativist president-within about 10 points of Barack Obama's 49 percent approval among Hispanic at roughly the same time in his presidency.\n\nThis does not mean Donald Trump is a popular president among Hispanics. He is not. But he is not repudiated, either, not by a mile. In a recent interview with Vox , University of Southern California professor Roberto Suro explained that while Latino voters \"hold negative views toward Trump,\" they do so \"by a much smaller margin than Democrats overall.\" Suro suggests that Latinos more closely resemble independent voters rather than \"a steadfast Democratic constituency.\" The polls, says Suro, also dispute \"the presumption that Trump's immigration policies have alienated large numbers of Latinos.\"\n\nThe fact that Donald Trump is viewed in a relatively favorable light by as many as 1 in 4 Hispanic voters should be alarming for Democrats, but it's not even their biggest problem. That would be turnout.\n\nLatino voters make up about 12 percent of the American electorate, with more than 27 million eligible voters. Those numbers will continue to grow in the coming years. The question is whether Hispanic turnout will increase as well. So far, it doesn't look promising. In California, the state with the country's largest Latino population, Hispanic turnout in this year's early summer primaries improved in numbers that might, at first, seem significant. A study led by Hispanic vote expert Matt Barreto found double digit increases in some areas of Southern California, impressive if not for the original variable: Latino turnout during the 2014 midterms in California sat at a dismal 12 percent. At a national level, Hispanics have consistently registered lower turnouts that white, black, or Asian voters. As a matter of fact, more eligible Hispanic voters have decided to stay home rather than vote in every election since 1996. To make matters potentially worse, more than 40 percent of potential Hispanic voters are millennials, another dispirited demographic.\n\nHispanic apathy toward voting is no laughing matter for the Democrats, but it should be even less so for the Latino community itself. I have heard many explanations for it over the years. Perhaps, some say, Hispanics simply shun civic engagement or lack political education. Others say Latinos have deep misgivings about the democratic process after having seen it fail in their countries of origin. None of the explanations satisfy me. Most of them, frankly, anger me. Whatever the reason for its depressing lethargy may be, the Hispanic electorate must unshackle itself, even if, in extremis, it means favoring a man whose sole project has been to question the right of millions of immigrants to belong in the United States.\n\nWhatever their preference, Latinos must vote, now. The place of our entire community within the fabric of American life depends on it.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "What It's Like for a Voting Rights Activist to Finally See Georgia in Play\n\nAs Election Day agonizingly came to a close Tuesday night, Joe Biden seemed within grasp of being the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the state of Georgia since Bill Clinton in 1992.\n\nBiden trailed President Donald Trump by less than a percentage point as of Wednesday night, with more than 90,000 absentee votes reportedly remaining to be counted in some of the state's most highly populated-and Democratic-friendly-counties.\n\nThat Georgia, long rock-solid for Republicans, remains in play is a testament to the state's growing and diversifying population, but also to the work of organizers like Nse Ufot, CEO of the New Georgia Project.\n\nThe New Georgia Project was founded by Stacey Abrams in 2013. Years before she ran for governor and became a party superstar, Abrams launched the organization with the aim of remaking the state's electorate into one that would mirror its population. Georgia has a long history of voter suppression, and Abrams' goal was to register at least 120,000 minority voters across the state by the 2014 midterm elections. She fell short that year, but the organization has remained active ever since, claiming to have registered about 500,000 voters across the state.\n\nAt the same time, Georgia has been systematically reducing polling locations, mostly under the watch of then-Secretary of State Brian Kemp, who went on to defeat Abrams for governor in 2018. Those closures have created disproportionately longer lines in Black communities that often discourage people from casting their votes.\n\nOn Wednesday, I spoke by phone with Ufot during a brief break in an exhausting week. With results still hanging in the balance, Ufot, who joined the New Georgia Project in 2014, told me about her hopes for turning Georgia blue, how the state has continued to suppress votes, and what it will take for the rest of the South to follow Georgia's promising lead.\n\nJoel Anderson: So, it's 3:30 p.m. Eastern time. What does the rest of your day look like?\n\nNse Ufot: We're basically going to go knock on Black folks' doors and tell them that we know something about their ballot that they might not know and that we need them to sign an affidavit and do something about it. Those are not necessarily easy conversations to have, and we're going to have another training tonight, just a briefing about how we're about to be democracy ninjas. Like, \"Here's your 50 people. I need you to come back with their affidavits.\" Or, \"I need you to confirm that they've signed their affidavit and they sent it to their county board of elections.\" Because some of it is as simple as they forgot to sign the outside of the envelope on their absentee ballot. And those are easy cures, those are easy fixes. But people don't know that that's why their ballot is being rejected.\n\nHow many houses do you guys have to go to?\n\nI can, with confidence, say we're looking at a universe of 3,000. ... I feel like people are trying to be helpful, but they're not. There's a guy on the internet telling people that there's 40,000 rejected ballots in DeKalb County.\n\nI've seen that!\n\nYeah. And it's going viral. And it's not helpful. It's more like 3,000.\n\nSo what happens is some of those ballots, some of the 40,000, are people who sent back their absentee ballot and didn't get confirmation that it was received. So they showed up to vote in person. And so their ballot was canceled.\n\nI know that people mean well. But we need to have quality information that people can rely on out there, and that ain't it.\n\nA daily email update of the stories you need to read right now.\n\nDisinformation is disinformation no matter where it comes from.\n\nYeah, 100 percent. And again, we are always on high alert for disinformation from bad actors, both foreign and domestic, but every now and then we are reminded that friendly fire is still fire. You still got shot.\n\nYou still have hope that those 3,000 votes are going to get counted and go into this tally? Are you not at all concerned that time is running out?\n\nI'm 1,000 percent concerned that time is running out. I believe we have until Friday at 7. But we also aren't going to leave it all in the field, you know? Two or 3 million phone conversations, 2 million text messages, a million doors in the middle of a pandemic. We've been running around the country telling people about the opportunity in Georgia for six years. I'm not going to pull up short with these two days left before the ballot deadline.\n\nThe results are still up in the air, but does this feel at all cathartic that Georgia is finally in play?\n\nI mean, I watched way too much Charlie Brown as a kid to answer that. Republicans have Lucy'd me way too many times. So I will say that, again, I'm not taking our foot off the gas until Jan. 20.\n\nSo you don't feel confident, then?\n\nIt's not that I don't feel confident. It's just that ... people lie, you know? And they have stolen elections. The entire country, the entire world watched the governor's race be stolen in 2018, and there have been no consequences. Brian Kemp is our governor.\n\nListen, people were so pumped and pleased with the [NBA's Atlanta] Hawks because they made their arena available for a polling location. That's where they're counting Fulton County's ballots. A brand new stadium ... and a pipe burst?\n\nYeah.\n\nSo, it's not that I'm not confident. It's just that I'm going to chop wood, I'm going to carry water until we see this thing all the way through.\n\nEven if you lose, even if you're Charlie Brown and you miss that kick, it doesn't invalidate your theory of the potential of the electorate, does it?\n\nNo, not at all. In fact, I would say that, if we lost, it is an additional proof point that Black voters and voters of color are so essential to Georgia's electoral outcomes that the folks who are in control of our elections infrastructure are doing everything to mute or neutralize the impact of their vote. That is how key the Black vote is to any electoral outcome in Georgia.\n\nSo the numbers that you're seeing are not even necessarily representative of what the potential is?\n\nSo, example: I woke up on Tuesday and found out that the place that I'd been voting for 20 years, that I wasn't supposed to vote there on Election Day.\n\nWow.\n\nWe still don't have the final tally, but Fulton and DeKalb counties, two of the largest and two of the Blackest counties in the state of Georgia, right now are up to 75 polling locations that were changed within 24 hours of the polls opening on Election Day.\n\nAgain, I'm a super sophisticated voter. I'm a strategist, I do this, I think about this all day, and I was able to shift and pivot. The reason that I found out about it is because there was almost a fistfight at my polling location.\n\nNow, it also gives you a sense of the kind of neighborhood that I live in, because voters showed up who had been voting there for multiple cycles and were told that they were in the wrong location, that their polling location had been moved. People were like, \"What?\"\n\nWhen you showed up, what did they say the reason was that your polling location had changed all of a sudden?\n\nWell, they, being the poll workers, have no idea. They have no idea. We are still making that inquiry. Everything that I've gotten has been sort of bullshit. The idea is that their projections were off, that they needed more polling locations than they thought, or they needed less polling locations than they thought. We've gotten both answers.\n\nSo, what did we have to do? We took to our social media. We went to Kinko's and to any printing shop that would have us. We printed out these giant sandwich board signs for volunteers to wear that said, \"Your polling location has been changed. Go here.\" That work was happening at 9 a.m. on Election Day.\n\n[There were also] lots of misinformation campaigns targeting grassroots organizations, saying that we aren't allowed to do what they call \" line warming .\" We weren't allowed to give water, give snacks, portable cellphone charges, chairs, etc., because that would somehow be considered compensation, like something of value in exchange for their vote. Not true. Not at all. We've been doing this work for ages. The ACLU, the NAACP, tons of organizations have been doing this work forever. But they got ahold of a handful of journalists, planted that seed in the public sphere, and there were some overzealous election workers that were telling folks that we couldn't be there. We had to move our food trucks, etc.\n\nWhen you have that sort of situation, do you guys just retreat and regroup?\n\nYeah, exactly, because we don't want to be a distraction. We don't want to encourage law enforcement to have any more interaction with voters than they have to.\n\nWhat we coach our volunteers and staff to do is to retreat, call us, and then shift if necessary, sometimes bringing in a \"supervisor,\" which is sometimes just another volunteer.\n\nI think a lot of people know about voter suppression. It can be a huge hurdle for a candidate to overcome. But it doesn't always come up when people talk about campaign failures.\n\nI think we do ourselves a disservice when we aren't radically honest about what it takes to win. I wish that somebody would've told me all of the things, which I mean, part of it is people just didn't know the extent to how nasty it got and how aggressive they are with voter suppression. I feel like it's my responsibility to be honest about the hurdles that need to be cleared and the challenges that are ahead, but what I also know about the psychology of it is that it can be demotivational. People will be like, \"Fuck it, well, why bother? They're going to steal it anyway.\"\n\nRight.\n\nThere's a fine line that we walk in being honest about what it takes to win, but while not discouraging or dismaying people, because honestly, that's also one of the sort of aims of disinformation. Black men were not going for Trump in crazy numbers. That narrative would not die. There's all kinds of trolling and everybody's wringing their hands, \"Oh no, Trump might get 30 percent of the black male vote.\" No . They were pushing that narrative.\n\nWe now know that Trump did better with white voters. We should've done more to invest in protecting the integrity of the vote, investing in Black voters, investing in young voters, because just pointing out how awful Trump is has not worked.\n\nObviously, suppression is larger than one person, but is a lot of what you're seeing in Georgia the result of Brian Kemp's attack on the integrity of the elections?\n\nI think it absolutely goes beyond that. I've been quoted before saying this, but the Confederacy and the civil rights movement both have claim to Georgia's past. Right now, what we are all living through and witnessing is a fight for Georgia's future. It feels like the entire sort of conservative, Southern, white dude establishment is losing its grip, its outside influence. I mean, he didn't win, but we were talking about [Senate candidate] Mike Espy in Mississippi, and Adrian Perkins in Louisiana, Raphael Warnock in Georgia , Jaime Harrison in South Carolina. Obviously, there's still a way to go, but the fact that they made it through primaries, Southern Democratic primaries, the fact that they were real contenders, the fact that Jaime Harrison is in a world where he outspent Lindsey Graham.\n\nI think this is a reaction to the browning of America, the browning of the South, the idea that Black Democrats are becoming more progressive or that there are more progressive voices. Because, I mean, if we're being honest, there was a conservative streak, or at least a moderate streak, amongst Black Southern Democrats, and there was some gentlemen's agreement and a lot of negotiations between white Republicans and Black Dems in the South. The whole system is being challenged, is being interrogated, you know? And I think that that is what is at play, not just Brian Kemp being really good at voter suppression.\n\nIt's unclear what the final result will be in Georgia. But there have been losses in other Southern states. It seems like people get especially disappointed when the South lets them down. What message are you passing on so people don't give up on the South?\n\nThat this is real. That it might not seem like it to them, but it's real. This is an opportunity for us to get smarter, for us to regroup, to know where the opportunities are, because I feel like, yeah, Texas in '20 was a long shot. I know that, you know that, but that we should allow ourselves to dream, right? That we should allow ourselves to hope. There's no way that Texas is going to flip if we can't even conceive it in our minds, if we can't even hope for it.\n\nLike Georgia is in the position ... and look at me talking like Georgia's been a swing state forever, right? [ laughs ] But Georgia's been in this position because of demographics and investment and organizing, right? And so there's definitely organizing that's happening. But the investment in Texas hasn't happened for very long, right? The demographics are coming along and they're doing what they're supposed to do, but that takes time.\n\nStacey Abrams deserves a lot of credit for this too, right?\n\nAbsolutely. Stacey almost gave America its first Black woman governor, right? And while I feel like I am an extraordinary organizer, my platform, my stage is in the spreadsheets, in the data, and in Black church basements and housing projects across the state-Stacey got Joe Biden and the DNC to take Georgia seriously, to invest. And so, I mean, while I feel like the work that I do is central and important to this change, I know we wouldn't be in the position that we're in without her leadership and her vision and her relationships. Yeah, she deserves a lot of credit.\n\nThis conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Trump's Outreach to Black Voters Isn't About Black Voters\n\nTimothy A. Clary/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe tail end of August finds Donald Trump making yet another pivot. He's fired one campaign manager and hired another; he's gestured toward contrition for his behavior and muddied his language on immigration, pledging a \" fair \" process for mass deportation. And he's begun to court black voters using an unconventional message.\n\n\"What do you have to lose,\" said Trump , making his pitch to black Americans at a recent rally in Dimondale, Michigan, a city that's less than 1 percent black (and named, incidentally, for a failed New York City real estate mogul ). \"You're living in poverty. Your schools are no good. You have no jobs. Fifty-eight percent of your youth is unemployed. What the hell do you have to lose?\" He continued: \"I will produce. I will produce the inner cities and I will produce for the African Americans. And the Democrats will not produce. All they've done is taken advantage of your vote. ... If you keep voting for the same people, you'll get exactly the same result.\"\n\nIn a re-election bid four years from now, Trump added, \"I guarantee you that I will get over 95 percent of the African-American vote. I promise you. Because I will produce.\"\n\nIt almost goes without saying that the facts here are wrong. Yes, blacks face major obstacles to upward mobility, among them structural poverty and unemployment driven by deep segregation and ongoing discrimination in job and housing markets. At the same time, most black adults are employed, most blacks aren't poor, most black children attend decent schools, and-barring an unimaginable shift in the political landscape-most black voters (upward of 95 percent) will oppose Donald Trump in the general election.\n\nBut as with his rhetorical moves on immigration, the content of Trump's message is less important and less interesting than the audience he's trying to reach. Hint: He's not trying to win over black voters. If that were true, Trump would have made this pitch at a black church or any other space where black Americans are in wide attendance. And while Trump has an uncanny ability to convince himself of virtually anything, he must know that he stands little chance of winning even a sliver of the black vote, which has turned decisively against his candidacy.\n\nNo, the point here-and the overall goal of this latest \"pivot\"-is to salvage Trump's standing with college-educated whites, who have turned decisively against the alleged billionaire for his outright bigotry and general buffoonery.\n\nTrump does best among white men without a college degree, but the simple fact of this election is that there aren't enough of them to win a national election. If 99 percent of white, non-college-educated men turned out to vote in November, according to demographer William Frey , Trump would still lose the popular vote by more than 1 million ballots given his deep deficits with every other demographic group.\n\nTrump needs to do something, and nonwhite voters are already too far gone for the real estate mogul to make up lost ground. (Trump is on pace to lose black voters by the largest margin in modern American history, surpassing even Barry Goldwater's catastrophic performance in the 1964 presidential election.) Enter Kellyanne Conway, part of the latest round of political operatives to hitch their fate to Trump's aspirations. Last week, Conway-who backed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz in the Republican primaries-supplanted Paul Manafort as manager for the Trump campaign. And in short order, she has worked to tame the worst of Trump's behavior.\n\nThe goal is straightforward: If Trump seems more normal and less erratic, then he could begin to win those white college-educated voters who are critical to victory in states like Colorado, Florida, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. For Team Trump, it's a simple equation. If those voters are turned off by his racist rhetoric, then he could address their fears by loudly reaching out to black voters. It's an old strategy, meant to assure a critical set of Republican-leaning voters that they aren't backing a bigot.\n\nConway herself gave away the game in a Sunday interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos. \"I live in a white community. I'm white. I was very moved by his comment,\" said Conway, when asked about the all-white venue for Trump's comments and the extent to which they sustain the idea that most black Americans live in poverty. Likewise, on Monday, Republican National Committee spokesperson Sean Spicer pointed to Trump's belated adherence to anti-discrimination laws as evidence of black outreach, something that wouldn't win a single black voter to Trump's side, but might assuage some white ones.\n\nIf Trump were an ounce more disciplined, this might work. Most Americans key into the election after Labor Day, and Trump stands a chance of convincing some that he's a broad-minded businessman with a steady hand. But Trump's reckless combativeness is part of his person-it's not a persona. He's incapable of sticking to a strategy, as evidenced by his gratuitous Monday-morning swipes at the hosts of MSNBC's Morning Joe , Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski. Worse for Conway (and perhaps those Republicans still hopeful he will change), Trump has a real affinity for the white nationalists and other provocateurs who surround his campaign. A Trump who hires the executive director of Breitbart (a virtual hub for online racists) and whose first ad for the general election is anti-immigrant demagoguery is not a Trump interested in being respectable.\n\nYes, Trump is aiming some rhetoric at the center of American politics. Yes, he's doing \"outreach.\" But don't mistake this for some kind of \"pivot.\" There is no pivot . Trump has one move for this election, and he is going to keep playing it and playing it until he loses.\n\nRead more Slate coverage of the 2016 campaign.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nAn expert on Black voting explains what's really happening with Black support for Donald Trump.\n\nby Jonquilyn Hill\n\nOn an unseasonably warm October afternoon, I did something I've done just about every fall since 2009: I made my way to Howard University's (HU) campus to celebrate homecoming. It's an event that's reached almost hagiographic status: name-checked in rap songs and even launching modeling careers .\n\nThe energy in October at my alma mater is always frenetic: You see students and alumni dressed their best, babies in strollers on the yard wearing HU onesies, and friends who have stayed connected across decades gathering once more at what's lovingly referred to as the Mecca . This year, the excitement in the air was even more palpable. For lack of better phrasing, the vibe was different. On one hand, the obvious culprit was that the university was celebrating its 100th homecoming. On the other hand, that difference may have something to do with the fact that the school's most famous alumna (at least right now) could soon become arguably the most powerful person in the world.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris wasn't on campus - she has spent part of her fall at the homecomings of historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) in swing states and not bright blue DC - but you wouldn't know that looking around. Howard does not have a political affiliation, but vendors gathered outside the entrance to the football game hawking bucket hats with Harris's name on them; her sorority sisters wore T-shirts with her face embroidered in pink and green; people fanned themselves with Harris/Walz fans while R&B singers entertained the crowd; and children in HU gear played in a bouncy house as their parents looked on. Despite its nonpartisan stance, the university is where Harris plans to be the night of the election, in a way creating a homecoming all her own.\n\nIn short, Howard is not a place with large numbers of Donald Trump supporters.\n\nBut Black voters are not a monolith, and the student body at Howard - one of the nation's most prestigious universities - is not a representative sample of all Black voters. Indeed, some polls suggest that Black voters may be supporting Trump in higher numbers than in either of his previous two runs - a shift that some observers believe will be large enough to mark a \" racial realignment \" in American politics.\n\nStill, the polls paint a murky picture. A recent NAACP survey found Black men were backing off their support for Trump and coming toward Harris in the final stretch before the election.\n\nSome experts are skeptical that, after the election, the \"racial realignment\" will materialize. Enter Andra Gillespie, a political scientist and associate professor at Emory University who specializes in Black political participation. \"The story of the cycle may very well be that people are overhyping the extent of Black defections away from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party,\" she says.\n\nShe points her finger at polling - or rather, the lack thereof - for Black voters specifically. While there has been plenty of polling with enough respondents to get a clear picture of the electorate, Gillespie argues that the numbers of Black voters within those samples don't provide a clear enough picture of Black voters. I spoke with Gillespie in October about the number of votes Trump may get from Black voters, and how even getting just 80 percent of the Black vote worries Democrats. We also talked about the roles education and age play within this segment of the electorate, and whether we're seeing shifts based on those factors.\n\nBelow is an excerpt of our conversation, edited for length and clarity.\n\nThere's been a lot of talk about the Harris campaign's struggles with Black voters lately. Can you lay out what that struggle looks like? Are we talking about Black people leaving the Democratic Party en masse?\n\nNo. The first problem has been making a lot of conjectures based on sample sizes that have huge margins of error. So you're looking at very noisy data. This started when Joe Biden was still the Democratic nominee for president. We forget that the number that comes out in surveys is the midpoint of a range of multiples. That's why surveys are always plus or minus.\n\nThere was some evidence of [Black support] softening. We don't know - because [Biden] dropped out of the race - whether or not people would have solidified their support for Donald Trump. Joe Biden was likely going to perform somewhere in the neighborhood of what he had done before and the numbers that you were getting, especially in the winter and early spring were suggesting that Donald Trump could get 30 percent of the African American vote. If your margin of error is minus 10, that means that that number could, in real life, be as low as 20 percent, which would suggest a gain.\n\nI'm thinking back to the Obama years, and 20 percent would be a lot.\n\nTwenty percent would be a lot since nobody's come close or even in the high teens since Gerald Ford and Richard Nixon. So yeah, it would be unprecedented. But that's what 100 people were saying or 150 people, or sometimes 200 people were saying in a survey in March or in February.\n\nI want to be very clear: Donald Trump could actually improve his share of African American voters. I'm not saying that that's impossible. But what's a more likely scenario is that he makes a marginal gain.\n\nLooking at the numbers from the New York Times/Siena College poll that came out [recently], Trump's numbers are in what I would call the normal range for a Republican candidate. What everybody was concerned about was the fact that Kamala Harris is pulling in below 80 percent on that poll. The upper bound of the margin of error would put that number into the low 80s, which would still be underperforming. But she still has three weeks from an election.\n\nEighty percent of any demographic sounds like a lot of voters, but it's framed as a problem for the Harris campaign.\n\nIt's a problem for the campaign because Black people make up the base of the Democratic Party; it becomes a problem when she's reliant on them turning out voting almost unanimously for her and in high numbers and in key battleground states.\n\nIn a state like Georgia, for instance, most white people are Republicans. Black people make up more than half of the Democratic Party in the state of Georgia. If they have anemic turnout or start to vote for the Republican or other candidates in the race, there just aren't many other votes that she can pick up. For a state like Georgia to be competitive, you've got to perform at historical averages, which means she needs to be doing 90 percent or better. And she needs Black turnout to be proportional to their actual numbers in the electorate: 30 percent of voters.\n\nYou also have to care about it in the Blue Wall states, because even though Black people don't make up as large a proportion of the population when you're talking about margins, that could easily be 10,000, 20,000, or 50,000 votes.\n\nI want to get into one of the narratives we've seen this election cycle, and that's this flip in the parties when it comes to education. One of the narratives that we see emerging is that Democrats are now the party of those with college degrees - your lawyers, your doctors; and Republicans are more the party of the working class - your blue-collar workers, maybe without a college degree. How do you see that playing out among Black voters?\n\nI think one thing that should be noted is 2016 was the year that pundits discovered that working-class white voters were Republican. That trend actually started a long time ago. I've seen graphs that chart this back to the mid-1970s, where you can see a decline in the number of non-college-educated white voters who are voting Democratic in elections. People just discovered it because Donald Trump ran on a populist platform, but he wasn't doing anything revolutionary or new there at all.\n\nSo yes, we now accept that education correlates with party identification, and voting behavior with college-educated voters being more likely to vote Democratic these days. If you go back and you look at that New York Times/Siena College poll , and you look at the breakdown in terms of support for Harris and Trump based on college education, you don't see much of a difference in terms of support among Black voters.\n\nThere are more conservative Black people who are still identifying as Democrats than Republicans, and the reason why is because of race. People who have a strong racial identity, people who perceive that the Democratic Party is the better party to handle issues related to race and civil rights. My friend, Tasha Philpot at the University of Texas, has noted that Black people aren't necessarily putting the same weight or emphasis on social conservatism in the same way that white people might.\n\nIf education is not this predictor for who Black people will vote for, is it a predictor of if they will vote or not?\n\nIf we're looking at support for Harris, there's only a percentage point difference [between Black voters with and without a bachelor's degree]. I see differences in age - that's actually not that unusual.\n\nWe expect that younger people have weaker partisan attachments because they're new to the electoral process. Older age cohorts, the oldest Black Americans uniformly, have made up their minds. I think part of the push on HBCU campuses is to get a group of young Black voters who are probably the most likely to show up because they're the most resourced to be convinced to support Kamala Harris and to convince their friends to do that as well.\n\nThe idea that they're not strong Democrats could be a harbinger of things to come, but it's going to take me 20 years to figure out what these folks are doing when they're in their late 30s before I would be willing to say, \"We're witnessing a realignment of Black voters away from the party.\" But I think that there's still the question of who's actually going to show up.\n\nI think it's interesting because you mentioned that the Harris campaign is on this HBCU tour. They're going to your Spelmans, your Morehouses, to talk to these young voters who are most likely to be resourced and most likely to show up to the polls. Every election year we hear the phrase \"Black people are not a monolith\" and that's always been true. But I think of W.E.B. DuBois and this idea of the Talented Tenth - that one of the jobs of the Black elite is to achieve racial progress. But that leaves out the other 90 percent of Black people. How have we seen this dynamic between education, class, and politics play out through the years?\n\nI think it's important to keep in mind DuBois repudiated the idea of the Talented Tenth . Part of the reason why college students in general are more resourced is, by being in college, they are picking up skills that are actually going to help them navigate civics.\n\nAs they get older, their education is going to prepare them for jobs that might actually give them more flexibility to be able to vote easier than others who might have shift work where their schedule is predetermined for them. All of those things accumulate and matter in terms of predicting a person's likelihood of turning out to vote.\n\nAlso, colleges end up reducing the costs of voter registration and voting. If you are on a college campus where your office of student life has put out voter registration materials so that all you have to do is basically pick one up as you're walking out of a cafeteria, that's a lot easier than somebody who is living in an apartment downtown who then has to go to a county board of elections.\n\nDo we know why Trump has been able to peel away some of these Black voters? What are the factors there?\n\nI am skeptical of how effective he has actually been, and we'll see how those numbers play out on Election Day. I would not be surprised at a marginal gain of a percentage point or two, but he was never getting the 30 percent that he claimed to get. If I think about those marginal gains, there have been outreach efforts to African American men the Republican Party has been engaged in for a long period of time that actually predates Donald Trump.\n\nThe message that Trump has used to try to reach out - which has usually been worded in a really offensive way - actually harkens back to a strategy that Richard Nixon used to try to reach out to Black voters. Keep in mind, Richard Nixon didn't do that badly, relatively speaking, among Black voters, despite the Southern Strategy, and it was because he used this strategy called Black Capitalism. He wanted to appeal to Black voters by talking about how Republican policies were more conducive to entrepreneurship and economic prosperity. And when you heard Donald Trump four years ago, trying to talk about his Platinum Plan - which, arguably, he may have ripped off from Ice Cube - that's a play toward Black capitalism.\n\n[Trump] in particular has benefited from having been in the public eye, having been sort of like the name-check for financial success . It's not surprising that there's some people who would ascribe very positive traits to him and to his presidency.\n\nHow do you see all of this playing out and evolving beyond 2024? What will you be looking out for in the years to come when it comes to the Black electorate?\n\nI think that we are still kind of in a post-1964 paradigm, where Black people are going to be overwhelmingly Democratic in their voting orientation. I expect that the ratio is going to still be somewhere in the neighborhood of about nine to one in favor of Democrats, give or take a couple of points.\n\nLet's say that Republicans incrementally gain two to three percentage points per election cycle among Black voters. Then 20 years from now I might say, \"Black people have been engaging in a secular realignment away from the Democratic Party and what we see is Republicans becoming more competitive over time.\" If that happens and we start to point to the trend line, then we are going to start to go back to 2020 and 2024 and see that as the beginning of the shift. But if we are in the beginning of the shift - I don't know that yet. It's way too early for me to say that. I think the thing that will make it change is not Donald Trump.\n\nThe lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat - and a closer look at where they should go next.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nWith disinformation and economic promises, Trump lobbied hard for the Black vote in the final days of the campaign.\n\nby Sean Collins\n\nOne of the surprises in the election is that President Donald Trump actually improved his standing with Black voters over four years ago.\n\nAccording to AP VoteCast , Trump won 8 percent of the Black vote, about a 2 percentage-point gain on his 2016 numbers (using the 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Study , or CCES, a national survey of more than 50,000 confirmed voters, as a point of comparison).\n\nAnd he may have done even better than 2 percentage points. If you compare the CCES numbers to the results of 2020 exit polls by Edison Research , Trump actually improved by 4 percentage points.\n\nA clearer picture will emerge in the years to come. Confirming whom poll respondents actually voted for takes time - for instance, a Pew Research Center study on the 2016 election's demographic breakdowns of verified voters was published not months after that contest, but in August 2018. AP and Edison pollsters are still adjusting the weighting on their data to ensure it's as accurate as possible, but here's what we know right now:\n\nThe election is still very close, and his gains with Black voters may not be enough to win Trump the presidency , but it is certainly enough to make Democrats wonder about their strategy with Black voters - particularly Black men.\n\nThere had been some warning signs.\n\nAhead of the election, polls showed Trump making inroads with Black voters, particularly younger voters and men. A survey taken by the Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape in late September and early October found that 21 percent of Black voters ages 18 to 44 supported Trump, while an October New York Times/Siena College national poll found that 11 percent of Black men backed Trump. Both results were in line with those of other polls , which generally found overall Black support for Trump to be around 10 percent.\n\nTrump pushed hard to win over Black voters in the final days of the race. His first appearance following his hospitalization for Covid-19 was an address to Black and Latinx voters given from the White House, during which he said, \"Black and Latino Americans are rejecting the radical socialist left, and they're embracing our pro-jobs, pro-worker, pro-police - we want law and order, we have to have law and order - and pro-American agenda.\"\n\nAnd he continued to make this case on the trail, promising to bring Black unemployment down to its historic pre-coronavirus lows, as well as making the case that Biden does not have the safety or best interests of the Black community in mind.\n\nTrump has repeatedly - and falsely - said that \"Joe Biden called Black Youth SUPER PREDATORS\" (a term used by former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, not Biden ), and aired ads that featured remarks Biden made during an interview with The Breakfast Club's Charlamagne tha God , in which the former vice president said, \"If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't Black.\"\n\nWhile some Black Trump supporters seemed to have been swayed by the president's rhetoric - a Black Michigan man voting for Trump told the New York Times he believed the president would make neighborhoods safer, for instance - the most salient points Trump made appear to be economic ones.\n\nAtionza Smith, a Biden supporter and co-founder of the activist group Revolutionaries Demanding Justice, told me that in her experience, Black Trump supporters \"like how he's improved employment ... they're kind of basically looking at things on a business level and not necessarily an ethics level.\"\n\nAnd that has been the case with a number of prominent Black Trump supporters.\n\nRapper 50 Cent, who has vacillated in his support of Trump, noted he was a fan of the president's tax policies, criticizing Biden's tax plan - which would raise taxes on those making more than $400,000 per year - and writing on Instagram , \"Yeah, i don't want to be 20cent.\"\n\nBut while 50 Cent has a fortune valued at $110 million , the median wealth and income for a Black family in 2019 was just $24,100 and $46,073, respectively.\n\n50 Cent would be hurt by Biden's tax plan , which stands little chance of passing if Republicans hold the Senate ; most Black Americans would not. But there is more to Trump's economic pitch than lower taxes. D'Angelo Crosby, an undecided voter who ultimately went for Biden, noted his father mentioned he had never made so much money as he had during the past four years, and that Black Trump supporters he'd spoken with had a similar message.\n\nCrosby said people have told him, \"It was like, 'Well, I got a higher pay rate, the highest I've ever been paid before. So I definitely think I want to stick with this president, because my money's looking a little better.'\"\n\nAs the Economic Policy Institute's Valerie Wilson has explained, wages for all ethnic groups have risen since the beginning of the Great Recession; Black wages rose the least, by 6.3 percent. Those increases began before Trump was president and were driven largely by rising minimum wages at the state and local levels , as well as a more competitive labor market .\n\nBut Trump has been able to capitalize on these increases in part due to his brand - before he became a politician, he worked to convince people that if they followed him, monetary success would come.\n\n\"People don't realize that before President Trump became president, the Black community loved President Trump,\" comedian and Black Trump supporter Terrence K. Williams told the Washington Post . \"Everybody wanted to be like President Trump, because he was a successful businessman.\"\n\nTrump's self-help books and Trump University classes promised that anyone could be like him, even if they were not born wealthy as he was. By emphasizing rising wages, formerly low unemployment , and his \" Platinum Plan for Black Americans ,\" he made the case to Black Americans that their financial aspirations were not out of reach - as long as he won a second term.\n\nThis case was reinforced by Trump's prominent Black surrogates, including rapper Lil Wayne, who wrote on social media after meeting Trump, \"The platinum plan is going to give the community real ownership. [Trump] listened to what we had to say today and assured he will and can get it done.\"\n\nEconomic promises are front and center in the \"Platinum Plan.\" It starts with a commitment to \"uplift Black communities across the country through a $500 billion investment.\" That money, the Trump campaign promised, would fund 3 million new Black jobs, 500,000 new Black businesses, increased Black homeownership, and new opportunities for Black churches to receive federal dollars.\n\nHow Trump might get a Congress that has struggled to pass a $500 billion pandemic stimulus package - particularly Senate Republicans, who have again starting claiming that they worry about adding to the national debt - to pass a half-trillion-dollar aid package for Black Americans was not included in the plan. But that lack of specificity never appeared to concern many of Trump's Black supporters.\n\n\"We've been voting for Democrats for 50 and 60 years and no progress,\" Marco Bisbee, a Black man the New York Times spoke with at a Trump rally in Michigan, said. \"Y'all had eight years of a Black man as president - he ain't give you what you need.\"\n\nKevin Jones, the first vice chair of North Carolina's Nash County Democratic Party, said Trump's promise to give Black Americans the tools they need to build themselves a better life speaks to something deeply ingrained in many Black Americans - particularly those who live in the South, as he does.\n\n\"Nobody believes in bootstrapping more than Black people in the South,\" Jones said.\n\nTrump promised to facilitate that bootstrapping, and his allies have suggested that opportunity awaits all those willing to take it. Weeks ahead of the election, for instance, Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner said the president had many \"solutions\" to Black Americans' problems, adding that the only thing that would hold Black people back is if Trump \"want[ed] them to be successful more than they want to be successful.\"\n\nKushner's comments were rightly condemned as racist, but the message they contained may have resonated with those who believe in bootstrapping and view success as a matter of grit, effort, vision, and hard work.\n\nAdherence to that view - coupled with other voting trends he'd observed in North Carolina - had Jones worried about a Trump victory, which as of this writing looks to be in doubt, though the race is still too close to call.\n\n\"In my 32 years of life, some of the most conservative people I've met are Black people,\" Jones told me ahead of the election. \"I think there are way more Black people who vote for Trump than the national media or national narrative will let on.\"\n\nWe don't have an exact figure, but we do now know more Black people voted for Trump in 2020 than did last time - and though Jones's worst fears don't appear to have come to pass, Trump managed to eke out gains that will likely be concerning to Democrats.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nBiden said African Americans would power a victory in South Carolina, and they did - he received 61 percent of the black vote.\n\nby Anya van Wagtendonk\n\nThroughout his campaign for South Carolina, former Vice President Joe Biden has repeatedly stated that his appeal among black voters meant he would win that primary.\n\nExit poll data from Saturday's contest now shows his confidence to be justified.\n\nBiden won the South Carolina primary handily, with almost half of all votes. And he led by even more among African American voters, winning 61 percent of the black vote, placing him 44 percentage points ahead of his competitors for that key demographic, according to an exit poll from the Washington Post. His closest competitor among black voters, Sen. Bernie Sanders, received just 17 percent of that vote.\n\nBiden, of course, had some advantages Sanders does not. He was boosted by being a known quantity, particularly to older black voters, thanks to a long career in the senate and his role as vice president to Barack Obama. He also clinched a key endorsement from Rep. Jim Clyburn, a prominent black Democrat and South Carolina kingmaker, in the final days of the primary race.\n\nBut even outside of the state, Biden has consistently polled the highest among black voters, and pointed to that support as evidence of why, despite poor showings in Iowa and New Hampshire, his campaign would bounce back once the race reached states with diverse populations.\n\n\"I want you all to think of a number: 99.9 percent,\" he told supporters in South Carolina as his fifth-place finish in New Hampshire was unfolding. \"That's the percentage of African American voters who have not yet had a chance to vote in America.\"\n\nAnd indeed, he followed up that loss in New Hampshire with a second-place finish in Nevada, powered in part by the fact that he won among black voters in that state. And that result set the stage for his significant win in South Carolina, a state where the Democratic electorate is more than 60 percent black.\n\nBut, of course, black voters are not a monolith , and one group of black voters in particular turned to a different candidate. The South Carolina primary's second-place finisher, Sanders, picked up just 17 percent of black voters according to the Post's polling, but, notably won - albeit by 2 percentage points - among black voters under 30, according to an NBC News exit poll .\n\nSome young black activists have pointed to Biden's support for the 1994 crime bill and recent bumbling moments about forced busing as reasons for not supporting him. As Vox's Li Zhou has reported:\n\nYounger black voters who spoke with Vox have emphasized that they are interested in more ambitious policies than the ones Biden has championed. Many older black voters also cited Biden's work alongside former President Barack Obama as a major asset, though younger voters did not weigh these efforts as strongly.\n\n\"I think there's a generational gap between younger African Americans and older African Americans,\" South Carolina state Rep. Kambrell Garvin, a Warren surrogate, previously told Vox. \"Younger African Americans like Joe Biden, but a lot of us aren't supportive of Joe Biden, because we want a change in policies. We aren't looking to tinker around the edges.\"\n\nMeanwhile, former South Bend, Indiana Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar have both struggled to make any inroads among black voters , a difficulty exemplified first in Nevada , and again in South Carolina .\n\nCandidates who consistently rate poorly among black voters - a group that comprises 20 percent of the national Democratic electorate - are going to struggle to achieve the kind of coalition needed to compete nationally. That's especially significant going into Super Tuesday, when more diverse states, including California, Texas, North Carolina, and Virginia, will cast their ballots.\n\nAs Zhou wrote, \"South Carolina is the first big test of the amount of backing candidates can rally from black voters.\" Biden has passed that test, as he'd said he would.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nBlack women delegates opened up about the thorniest challenges ahead.\n\nby Miranda Kennedy and Noel King\n\nBy now, you've probably heard the message loud and clear from Democrats: This election is all about unity.\n\nThe Today, Explained podcast team has been at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this week, and inside and outside the perimeter of the United Center, Democrats are buzzing with exuberance and relief: They now believe they have a real shot at winning the White House in 2024, and the party's toughest issues are not a welcome topic of conversation.\n\nTonight, after accepting the party's nomination earlier in the week from the campaign trail, Kamala Harris will appear in Chicago to close out the convention, carrying the mantle of the \"renewed sense of hope\" that Michelle Obama - and the rest of the Democratic Party - have bestowed upon her.\n\nFirst, though, Today, Explained sat down with three Black women delegates for Harris to ask about the thorniest challenges, from Gaza policy to identity politics, that Democrats will face in these next 11 weeks before Election Day.\n\nThe delegates are:\n\nAll three committed to cast their votes for Harris and consider it their role to support and defend Democratic Party policies. But we picked at the party's scabs a little bit and found that even the most faithful Democrats were willing to acknowledge that Black voters and nonvoters are no longer the assured bloc of support they have been for decades and that the Israel-Palestine conflict has caused a worrisome fissure between the official party and young progressives. Here's what they had to say. You can hear more of the discussion here on Today, Explained.\n\nAmericans' disapproval of Israeli military actions in Gaza eased this summer, but 48 percent still disapprove, according to a Gallup poll conducted in June. This week, thousands of protesters, mostly keffiyeh -clad and young, were waiting for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris - or \"Genocide Joe and Killer Kamala,\" to them - in Chicago. On Monday, they gathered at Union Park and marched along a circuitous route outside the convention center to demand that the US end aid to Israel. They will march the same route Thursday ahead of Harris's acceptance speech.\n\nIt's a live issue for many voters, but especially people like Hala Ayala, who is of Lebanese descent.\n\nAyala points out that Harris called for an \"immediate ceasefire\" back in March, and told us she'd met Harris and felt seen on the issue of Gaza. \"I took that authentically because that's who she is, and I took that as there's more work to be done,\" she said.\n\nThe issue of Gaza is also fraught for Gen Z politician Mo Jenkins. Nearly 50 percent of Democrats or Democratic-leaning young adults under 30 say they sympathize more with Palestinians than Israelis, according to Pew.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nHistorian Leah Wright Rigueur explains why Republicans consistently fail to attract Black voters.\n\nby Ezra Klein\n\nThe Republican Party began losing the Black vote around 1936. Since then, Republicans have commissioned reports, hired consultants, and spent huge sums of campaign dollars trying to win back Black voters. The project continues today: This year's Republican National Convention presented a lineup of speakers far more diverse than the Republican Party itself, making the case for the \"Party of Lincoln.\" A third of African Americans, after all, self-identify as \"conservative.\" And yet, no Republican presidential candidate has won more than 15 percent of the Black vote since 1964 (many have received well under 10 percent ).\n\nLeah Wright Rigueur is a historian and public policy scholar at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government and the author of The Loneliness of the Black Republican , a remarkable study of the distinctive ideologies woven through the Black conservative and Black Republican traditions. The book traces the history of why Black voters left the GOP and what the Republican Party has tried to do - and what it has refused to do - to win them back.\n\nRigueur has also spent the past decade teaching classes on racial protests, riots, and how they shaped American politics in the 20th century. We discuss the historical analogues for today's protest movement, what's different now than in 1968, the complex relationship between protesters and electoral politics, how these movements can lead to both lasting change and white backlash, and more on The Ezra Klein Show .\n\nAn edited excerpt from our conversation follows. The full conversation can be heard on The Ezra Klein Show .\n\nI wanted to start with the report Ralph Bunche wrote for the Republican Party way back when. Tell me the context of that report and what it recommended.\n\nAt the time, Ralph Bunche is a political scientist, a professor at Howard University. He goes on later to be a career diplomat and wins the Nobel Peace Prize in the 1950s. So he's a revered figure in Black politics, but also in American politics, particularly in American statesmanship and statecraft. And here he is in the 1940s working with the Republican Party - not out of any kind of affinity for the Republican Party, but more so out of concern for the idea of two-party politics and where Black people fit within that two-party political system.\n\nHe'd been really upset about the New Deal. He felt like the New Deal hadn't gone far enough for Black people and that there had been elements of the New Deal that had essentially been racist. So when the Republican Party reaches out to Ralph Bunche to do some consulting work, asking how to get Black voters to come back into the Republican fold, Bunche agrees. But he agrees only on the condition that when he finishes his final report on this that the report be published in its entirety. And that's really where things start to get interesting.\n\nAs some context here, I think people believe that the racial realignment happened around the Civil Rights Act. But for Black voters, it started happening earlier. You point out that Black voters were heavily Republican before the New Deal and then they began to swing Democratic after it. So what happened there? And how does it lead to the Republican Party asking Bunche for his help?\n\nThere's this idea that African Americans leave the Republican Party in the 1960s. To some extent that is true, but the really interesting thing here is that African Americans leave the Republican Party, the party of Lincoln, in droves in 1936 during Roosevelt's second election. And they leave because of the economic impact of the New Deal.\n\nThey actually experience the policies, the plans, the procedures, the programs of the New Deal in ways that affect their day-to-day lives. That allows them to overlook that history of discrimination of the Democratic Party and the persistent segregationists that are within the Democratic Party. On top of that, Black voters really are affected by the civil rights activism of Eleanor Roosevelt. And you see a watershed movement.\n\nThe Republican Party notices this almost immediately. They start up all different kinds of efforts on how to get Black voters back. In 1939, they reach out to Ralph Bunche because they say, \"We have to be able to compete with the New Deal and with the Roosevelt administration. We're bleeding voters.\" You know, Black voters are still affiliating as Republicans, but they're not voting Republican anymore. So how do we change this?\n\nAnd what does Bunche recommend?\n\nRalph Bunche gives them this comprehensive report [on] where the New Deal has failed. He essentially says the New Deal hasn't gone far enough - that the New Deal has had discriminatory practices and policies ingrained even in some of its most effective programs. But he also says the Republican Party has not done enough - that the Republican Party should be going further in its policies, and they can no longer rely on the \"spirit of Abraham Lincoln\" freeing the slaves to move Black voters.\n\nSo he argues in favor of all kinds of policy changes. He says you need to be more effective on health care and calls for universal health care. He says you need to be more effective on Social Security relief, finance, agriculture, labor - all of these different areas. He says there is room for the Republican Party to make inroads among Black voters by speaking to the very issues and needs that Black voters want. He's also very explicit about the need for these programs and policies to be economic.\n\nWhen the Republican Party gets this report initially, they widely praise it. They said this exactly what we need. But Bunche put in a caveat saying either you publish the report in full or you don't publish it at all. So when the Republican Party comes back and says they only want to publish the parts where he attacks the New Deal, Bunche says no: You have to publish the entire thing or not at all.\n\nSo they end up not publishing it at all, but bits and pieces end up being leaked to the press, particularly the Black press and the Black media. It comes to be known, particularly as Bunche is making the rounds, talking about the fact that the Republican Party has a blueprint for how to move African Americans back into the party but they're unwilling to do it.\n\nI love this story because it seems to me that it's been the same question for a long time now: The Republican Party wants to win back Black voters, but what they would like is for there to be an easier way to do it than to have to change their policy agenda to meet the actual economic and social needs of Black voters. They keep looking for a message or an orientation or a messenger. But every time somebody comes to them and says, look, African Americans have a very high uninsurance rate, you need a better idea for what to do about that than the Democrats have, they say no, we want some other way of addressing this.\n\nAbsolutely. I think there are a couple takeaways from that Ralph Bunche report. The first is that he says you cannot run with both hare and hound, meaning that the Republican Party has to decide whether it wants to court, say, the dissident white vote of the Democratic Party and rely on racial antagonisms on the backs of Black people - or do you really want Black voters? You cannot seduce both. And in the case of Black voters, economic policy in particular is really, really important.\n\nIn the 1970s, we see McNeill and Associates, which is a Black Republican consulting group consulting with the RNC, say virtually the same thing that Ralph Bunche has said in 1939 and 1940. They say we have to find a way to make these ideas palatable or attractive to Black people because right now, Black voters are making a pragmatic vote even in cases where they don't like Democrats - even in cases where they might be more aligned religiously, spiritually, what have you, with the Republican Party.\n\nThey will not choose the Republican Party because, one, they believe Republicans are racist and racially antagonistic, and two, there are no [Republican] policies that they see affecting their day-to-day lives for the better.\n\nIt's the two things that go hand in hand. And all too often we see that Republicans recognize this, but they're unwilling to make either one of those kind of significant structural changes in order to actually get a significant proportion of the Black vote.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Lockhart\n\nBlack voters are getting a significant amount of attention these days.\n\nIn many ways, it's a welcome development: After years of helping Democrats secure crucial election victories, black voters are being recognized as an influential voting bloc. This was perhaps most notable in 2008 and 2012, where their increased turnout helped deliver the White House to Barack Obama, the nation's first black president.\n\nBut black voters had been wielding their power even before this, in situations like the 1984 Democratic primary , where the support of black voters single-handedly turned Jesse Jackson into a contender, or the 1992 primaries, which saw black voters help Bill Clinton secure the party's nomination. Since the 1990s, black voters have largely backed the candidate that has gone on to win the Democratic nomination, cementing the group's status as powerful players in presidential politics.\n\nBut that does not mean black voters are a monolith.\n\nIn other words, there isn't a single black vote. There are many. A seemingly monolithic black electorate often coalesces only after individual black voters make decisions based on a nuanced set of political calculations.\n\n\"Black voters today are behaving in a very smart and strategic way that they've always behaved in, but no one ever really lets us be smart,\" says Keneshia Grant, an assistant professor of political science at Howard University. \"Black voters get viewed as sheep who are being told where to go, and I think that's wrong and the data shows that this is wrong.\"\n\nBlack voters, much like other voters in the electorate, have varying ideologies. Some are more conservative than others . Some are far more progressive. And there other splits as well, along lines of age, gender, income, and geography. This has always been the case, and yet, it is rarely discussed in mainstream political conversations about courting black voters.\n\nIt's an important reality, though, and could become particularly significant in the current election cycle. While prior elections have shown a united black vote, over the past few months black political journalists, strategists, and academics have made the argument that the 2020 race is incredibly fluid . With so many candidates in play, black voters could potentially spread their vote across multiple candidates in early-primary and caucus states, or push their support to a different candidate than former Vice President Joe Biden, the current frontrunner.\n\nIn fact, a lot of black voters (like voters more broadly) have said they are open to switching to a different candidate or are undecided about who to support, and the next few months of campaigning could be especially important for any campaign hoping to attract as many black voters as possible. Candidates need to do more than black outreach, though: They also must show a clear understanding of black voters, their needs, and their concerns.\n\n\"Based on the different demographics of the black electorate, you do have some people making different choices about who their top candidate is or who their second choice is,\" Adrianne Shropshire, the executive director of BlackPAC, a group focused on increasing black political power, tells Vox. \"That is what is most distinctive about the black vote now. It isn't exactly going en masse to one place.\"\n\nTo understand what's at stake when it comes to winning black voters in 2020, it's helpful to understand how this group has voted in previous elections. A 2019 analysis from NBC News offers one of the most comprehensive histories of black voting behavior for the nine competitive national Democratic primaries that have occurred since exit polling began in the 1970s.\n\nThat project found that black voters have become an increasingly important share of the Democratic Party, going from a bloc that drew national attention as it flexed its muscle during the 1984 and 1988 presidential campaigns of civil rights activist Jesse Jackson - forcing concessions and promises from the Democratic Party in the process - to a group that 20 years later helped Barack Obama gain the electoral advantage necessary for him to clinch the 2008 Democratic nomination.\n\nIn what is perhaps more predicative to the 2020 election, though, the NBC News project showed that black voters have become powerful because of how they vote, with this demographic often rallying around a single candidate as the primary voting continues - but not always before. Securing a high margin of votes from black people can make it easier for candidates to win decisive victories in states with high black populations, helping to tip the nomination toward them.\n\nTake, for example, the aforementioned 2008 Democratic presidential primary. While then-Sen. Barack Obama's success over Hillary Clinton is often remembered - as is the fact that black voters began to overwhelmingly support him after the Iowa Caucus - what often isn't as readily acknowledged is that for months before this, there had been a noticeable split in the black voters backing him and the black voters who weren't. Early in the contest, Obama was supported mainly by younger black voters , as older voters and many black politicians backed Clinton, pointing to her established history in the black community, her work during her husband's presidential administration, and for some, their belief that Obama wasn't well-known enough to be electable .\n\nBut when a majority of this group flipped to Obama in 2008, they helped him advance further, propelling him to a win in South Carolina weeks later. Obama also won every primary held in a state where blacks were more than 20 percent of the population , and in some states, he managed to win over as much as 90 percent of black voters.\n\nThat primary offers a lot of lessons. For one, it shows that the margin of victory for a candidate among black voters matters almost as much as the victory itself, meaning that it's in a candidate's best interest to push their support among black voters as high as it can possibly go. The 2008 primary also provides one example of how black voting power has worked in recent elections: showing how a presumed frontrunner who was banking on black support (Clinton), and actually did have a lot of support from specific groups of black voters and the black political class, saw much of her lead evaporate after a different candidate proved they could also get votes from different portions of the electorate.\n\nAnd after the primary, the 2008 general election also showed that black voters responded well to continued engagement and outreach later in the election cycle, with their turnout reaching historic levels in 2008 and 2012 .\n\nBut if 2008 showed how black voters could help turn a candidate from an underdog to a presidential nominee, eight years later, in 2016, black voters showed how withholding their votes could keep a candidate's chances as a longshot.\n\nIn this cycle, Clinton, again the presumed frontrunner, faced off against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. However, this time, Clinton's lead with black voters held, helping her win the nomination. But there were fractures among black voters that were often overlooked or dismissed in discussions of the contest: a large chunk of young black voters, much as they had for Obama, broke for Sanders early and stayed with him through the primary, and also played a key role in Sanders winning in Michigan . But what differed this time is the fact that Sanders was unable to pull many older black voters to his side.\n\nThe story of black voters in 2016 has largely focused less on the primary than on the general election, with news reports in the immediate days after the November election focusing on how black turnout declined compared to 2008 and 2012. But when it comes to actually understanding differences among black voters, the 2016 primary matters: It shows some important differences among black voters that have only grown more pronounced in 2019.\n\nIn 2016, the differences between Sanders and Clinton supporters weren't just a matter of a younger voter/older voter split or a geographic one. Clinton also did better with black women than black men and attracted more support from more moderate black voters looking to maintain the gains of the Obama era rather than adopt an agenda of radical change. On the other hand, she also got less support from young black progressives looking for a jolt to the system, many of whom criticized Clinton's record on issues like racial justice.\n\nThis reveals some important divides in how black voters settled on her candidacy and shows that while the majority of black voters may have backed Clinton, there were many different reasons and motivations behind why they did (and in some cases did not). More importantly, the way these divides intersect and diverge is critical to understanding the behavior of the black electorate now. Elections may have shown that black voters often become an electoral monolith, but they are far from being an ideological one.\n\n\"Black America is no more monolithic than any other group,\" Theodore Johnson, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice who studies African American politics and black voter behavior patterns, told Vox. \"Whatever the spectrum is for ideology and politics, black voters are scattered all along that spectrum just like any other racial group.\"\n\nIn the 2020 election cycle, it's likely that we will see high black turnout and enthusiasm. Many black voters will mobilize for a number of reasons: a desire to oust Trump , an interest in a new anti-racist policy agenda in the White House, and a hope for change on the issues affecting their daily lives and communities.\n\n\"Black voters want to back the candidate who is going to win, and in the Trump era, that also means backing the person most likely to push Trump out of office,\" Johnson says.\n\nWith the start of primary voting still a few months away, we can't definitively say who will benefit from this. Currently, polling shows former Vice President Joe Biden having a large lead among black voters , beating his competitors by double digits with this group. Biden is banking on black support, and his team has increasingly indicated that it sees the majority-black South Carolina primary, which will happen on February 29, as critical to his chances of winning the nomination . According to an October poll from Winthrop University , for now, his plan is solid: 46 percent of black voters in South Carolina say he's the most likely candidate to get their support.\n\n\"The black folks support Biden, next to Jesus right now, that's where he is,\" Dot Scott, head of Charleston's NAACP chapter, told Vox's Li Zhou recently , pointing to Biden's deep ties to black communities in the state and his role as Barack Obama's vice president.\n\nWhen the primary began earlier this year, some experts thought things would turn out differently. \"I went into [this election cycle] thinking that this would be a cycle where we would see black voters' political diversity at play,\" Johnson told me. He noted that last winter and spring, the field seemed to be wide open and full of relatively unknown candidates of different ages, racial backgrounds, genders, and political ideologies, potentially leaving black voters to spread out across multiple candidates.\n\nBut that changed once a particular candidate entered the race. \"As soon as Biden jumped in, it sort of ruined the calculus,\" Johnson says of the former vice president's leap to the top of the polls this spring, a position he has maintained (with some stumbles ) in the months since. \"He's such a known quantity.\"\n\nAs I wrote in June , there are a lot of reasons why some black voters started lining up behind Biden early. Some black voters say their support makes sense given their pragmatism, and they believe that Biden is the only \"electable\" candidate who will be supported by more moderate white voters and some conservatives unwilling to vote for Trump. Other black voters place a lot of importance on Biden's role as Obama's vice president and support him due to that history. And some black voters believe that Biden is actually the best policy choice, that his incremental approach to civil rights and call for a return to \"normalcy\" is the right one in this particular moment. There are voters who believe more than one of these things and others who believe all three.\n\n\"There is an aspect of this that is about who can put up the fight that is going to be required to take Trump down,\" Shropshire tells me. \"And some black people know that part of Biden's narrative is that he's a fighter and that he fought for Obama. And that is not insignificant.\"\n\nSome of these arguments have been pushed frequently by the Biden campaign, which has repeatedly emphasized the former vice president's connection to black voters, particularly the older, more moderate voters who regularly turn out for elections. \"They have a sense of who my character is and who I am - warts and all,\" Biden told a group of black reporters in August.\n\nPolling also shows that this group is supporting Biden strongly. An October poll from Morning Consult, for example, found that Biden has 48 percent support among black voters aged 45-54, 53 percent among those aged 55-64, and 56 percent among those 65 and older.\n\nBiden is also quick to remind voters of his role in the Obama administration, which also likely plays a role in these numbers. \"The Biden campaign has been masterful at messaging Biden as the 'great friend and ally of Barack Obama,' who Obama loved so much and chose as his vice president,\" Grant, the Howard University professor, says. \"To the extent that black people are saying that they support Joe Biden, I think that they are supporting who they think has the highest likelihood of being competitive in a general election and their opinion of Barack Obama.\"\n\nHowever, she adds, \"I don't think they like Biden as an independent person who's running and has policies they are enamored with.\"\n\nThis latter point is telling: Given criticism of the former vice president's record on some issues and arguments that he isn't strong enough on matters of racial justice to be the best pick for black voters, there could be an opening for a different candidate to pull support from Biden in the coming months. But that candidate, and anyone else looking to shrink Biden's lead with black voters, needs to be working to make inroads with them now.\n\nWhile Biden might have the majority of the black vote now, his support can't really be taken for granted. Just look what happened to Clinton.\n\nGenerally speaking, at this point, someone defined as a \"black Biden voter\" looks very similar to those who strongly backed Clinton in the early months of the 2008 primary: they're more likely to be older, are more closely aligned with the Democratic Party, and in Biden's case are more interested in returning to a stable state of affairs after Trump than voting for a change agent.\n\nAnd while all of this is currently working in Biden's favor, it isn't a completely sure thing that this will permanently be the case. After all, much like in 2008, many of these voters could still move if they believe another candidate stands a better chance of winning the primary. As Angela Geter, the Democratic Party chair in South Carolina's Spartanburg County, told Vox earlier this month , \"Nobody has it in the bag. Everybody needs to put in the work.\"\n\nIn fact, recent reporting from the New York Times has highlighted that some of the splits among black voters seen in recent elections are already highly noticeable in the current primary contest. Older black women and men, for example, are far more sold on Biden than their younger counterparts, a trend consistent with the 2008 and 2016 primary cycles. A September Essence poll found that black women aged 18-34 ranked Biden fourth, putting him behind Sanders, Harris, and Warren. Older black women, however, ranked Biden first, supporting him in high enough numbers to make him the overall leader in the poll.\n\nAnd while October polling shows that roughly 40 percent of African American respondents support Biden right now, his numbers with black voters under 45 are lower than that. The aforementioned Morning Consult poll, for example, finds that just 32 percent of black voters ages 35-44 support Biden. For the youngest bloc of voters, aged 18-29, this number falls to 29 percent.\n\nThe figures match with what experts tracking black voters of different ages have seen. Those who are not Biden supporters are more likely to be (but aren't exclusively) younger and are often further to the left in their ideology. When they look at Biden, they see not stability but a candidate whose call to return to the Obama era is insufficient to deal with the current political reality - a reality that differs in many ways from what Obama himself faced while in office.\n\nThere are also questions about how Biden would navigate a political landscape that has been further shaped by a surge in activism among the black Left and a growing desire for antiracism among some white liberals . And as Vox's Ezra Klein wrote in September , the fact that Biden differs from the 44th president in terms of style, politics, and demographics means that he \"will not be able to pursue an Obama-like campaign or run an Obama-like administration,\" something that goes against his efforts to present himself as a natural continuation of the Obama presidency.\n\nThere have also a been series of issues on the campaign trail - including Biden's opposition to using busing for school desegregation in the 1970s , his support for the 1994 crime bil l, and his many recent unforced errors when discussing race and policy - that are a large part of the reason why many younger black voters say they're looking to take their votes elsewhere. Some of them are trying to convince their elders to do the same .\n\nMany of these Biden skeptics would likely fall into the roughly 20 percent of respondents who told the Black Census Project earlier this year that the Democratic Party is taking African Americans for granted. And these voters want their chosen candidate to have a clear vision for how they plan to fight racism and aid the black voters who help deliver the nomination and, they hope, the presidency.\n\nPerhaps recognizing this, some candidates trailing Biden with black voters have fought to make inroads with specific groups separate from the often older and typically more moderate black voters Biden is currently leaning on.\n\nSanders, for example, has worked to build on the connections he established in 2016 with younger progressive black voters and he has also worked on outreach to other black voters attracted to his calls for a political revolution.\n\nHarris has targeted black women , who are among the most consistent black voters. In the wake of critiques from some African Americans that a black woman can't win against the current president, she has also been more proactive than other candidates in going after Trump.\n\nBooker, the only other black candidate, has noticeably struggled to find an exact lane with black voters. But he has focused on highlighting a message of hope and justice while speaking with mannerisms of the black church, suggesting that for now at least, he is likely looking to peel voters from any of the other candidates.\n\nOther candidates have largely used issue agendas and discussions of racial justice, be they platforms focused on specific issues like police violence and reform (Julián Castro) or larger \"black agenda\" platforms addressing a number of issues comprehensively (Pete Buttigieg) when making appeals to black voters.\n\nIn another primary cycle, these pitches - and the fact that the Democrats have the most diverse primary field in history - might have been more persuasive to black voters. But right now, many these candidates, and especially the candidates of color, haven't really risen to the top of the list for many black voters.\n\nThe candidate who currently faces the biggest pressure to reach black voters - and also stands to make the biggest gain with black voters as of now - is Warren, who has seen her level of national support among black voters increase several points in recent months but has not done well enough yet to catch Biden. In the coming months, her efforts to make inroads might face additional hurdles among some groups of black voters who value familiarity and name recognition.\n\nWarren's strategy has largely revolved around using her policy proposals - from her plan to provide support to historically black colleges and universities and black students struggling with student loan debt to her plans for black women worried about maternal and infant mortality - to highlight various ways that racial injustice has affected black Americans' quality of life. And as she works to cut into Biden's lead in South Carolina, Warren is also trying to build connections with black community leaders in an effort to grow her base of support.\n\nThose efforts are being watched closely by black voters, and they could become extremely important in the coming months. \"She's playing the long game - black voter outreach isn't something where you do it well for a month and then see voters swing,\" says Johnson. \"But if Biden stumbles, she's there to pick up all of that support because she's putting in the work now.\"\n\nOf course, all of this talk about black voters and the differences between them overlooks something else about black voters a few months before the first primary contests: A lot of them are still undecided about who they will vote for. In fact, some polls show that this undecided group is arguably bigger than the voters who have sided with any of the candidates in the field.\n\nAn August poll from Pew , for example, found that while Biden held the lead among black voters, 45 percent of black voters polled weren't currently supporting a candidate. The more recent Winthrop University poll found that while 46 percent of likely black voters in South Carolina currently support Biden, 44 percent of black respondents said they might change their mind about who they are supporting and 9 percent said they don't know yet who they are voting for. Just 41 percent said they were very sure about their vote.\n\nLooking at the specific groups of black voters candidates are courting - like young voters and black women - a lot of them remain undecided, too. In June, the University of Chicago's GenForward Survey found that 24 percent of young black respondents aged 18-36 said they would support someone not currently in the primary race. In September, the aforementioned Essence poll found that roughly one-quarter of the black women it contacted were undecided.\n\nThis suggests that black voters are carefully weighing their options and are looking at multiple candidates or, in the cases of other black voters dissatisfied with the options, are deciding if they will vote at all. And coming after years of black political strategists arguing that the Democratic Party needs to do a better job of engaging with black voters beyond eleventh-hour calls for them to get out the vote on Election Day, what happens in the coming months could be especially important to convincing some black voters that they should turn out next November.\n\n\"The party is going to have to get the people who haven't been participating to participate,\" Grant says, noting that some undecided or infrequent black voters \"will support the person who went and got them.\"\n\nHow candidates go and get voters will depend on their outreach. Polls of black voters have shown that there are multiple priorities for different groups, including issues like health care, education, climate change, racism, and criminal justice. Who black voters, individually, will ultimately vote for is far from settled. Their process of determining who to support can't be reduced to simple statements about a universal \"black vote.\"\n\n\"It would be a misjudgment for people to think that any of these numbers are baked,\" says Shropshire. \"There's just so much time left.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nAuthor and professor Chryl Laird on whether the presumptive Democratic nominee is taking black voters for granted.\n\nby Fabiola Cineas\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden is no stranger to the political gaffe . And on Friday, he stepped in it once again.\n\nAfter putting it off for months, Biden finally sat down for an interview on \"The Breakfast Club,\" a radio show that's earned a place in the black cultural canon for its buzzy, confrontational interviews of entertainers and political leaders. While the 18-minute interview with host Charlamagne Tha God was tense overall, it wasn't until its final moments that Biden uttered the sentence that would set social media aflame : \"If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black.\"\n\nThe backlash was swift, with critics claiming that Biden overstepped, a sign that he's taking the black vote for granted. Others came to the presumptive Democratic nominee's defense, arguing that the offhand comment was \"in jest.\" Biden himself later went on to express regret: \"I was much too cavalier. [...] I shouldn't have been such a wise guy,\" he said during a virtual meeting with an organization that advocates for black economic empowerment.\n\nBiden's latest comments add to his portfolio of blunders and off-the-cuff remarks that have led people to question his commitment to the black community. Last year, when he invoked tender memories of working with segregationist senators to make a moot point about civility, leaders like Sen. Cory Booker criticized Biden and urged him to apologize. It also took Biden nearly 30 years to acknowledge his failings in the handling of Anita Hill's testimony .\n\nAt the core of Biden's latest comments are questions concerning the black community's solidarity politics: Why do black people vote Democrat if the party, and its presumptive nominee, seem to take the black vote for granted? And will comments like these ultimately matter to black people come November?\n\nChryl Laird, assistant professor of government at Bowdoin College and co-author of the book Steadfast Democrats: How Social Forces Shape Black Political Behavior , says supporting the Democratic Party is an entrenched norm for black people. And yet while Biden's statement isn't technically \"wrong,\" it's problematic because he, as a white person, cannot be a norm enforcer for the black community.\n\nLaird explains to Vox how Biden's comments might impact black voter turnout in the general election. Our interview has been edited and condensed.\n\nLet's talk about the recent \"The Breakfast Club\" interview when Joe Biden, unprompted, said, \"If you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black.\" What was your initial reaction to his statement?\n\nI face-palmed just thinking about it because Biden is notorious for saying out-of-pocket statements, especially with respect to race. Even with all of the ties to Obama, he's made statements related to race around the Anita Hill situation and around segregationists. So I was not that stunningly surprised by it as much as I was like, \"You need to think about what you say before you say it!\" I think he is someone who appeals to black voters, as we saw in the primary . He has support, but he needs to be careful because the support he's gotten shouldn't just be assumed. And he doesn't need to speak to African Americans in a way that isn't understanding of their politics. It came off like he didn't necessarily have respect for it. It comes off as patronizing.\n\nIn watching the full interview, did you feel there was an overall casual tone or carelessness on Biden's part? And let's break down \"you ain't black.\" What's the problem with him saying that?\n\nThe statement itself was sort of in jest, as others have said. But even in jest, you are an older white man; you are a white person, period, who is speaking on identity politics outside of your own group. You are not black, so placing yourself in that position as some arbiter of blackness makes you an interloper. This is an intra-group, within-group politics.\n\nIf I recall the full interview, in the lead up to the Biden statement, there was discussion about black politics and the election. The interview had already been a little tense between the two of them and \"The Breakfast Club\" is notorious for controversial interviews. I don't know how much prep [Biden] had going into it. There's a casualness to it that's appropriate to this setting since he's trying to appeal to an audience that is young, Gen Z, or millennial voters who are African American or Latino and listen to the show. He's trying to appeal to a base of individuals whose support he did not get in the primaries.\n\nIf he were trying to appeal to older voters, who'd be listening to something like a Steve Harvey or Tom Joyner [radio show], there would be a different decorum. Same with if he were in a black church or traditional black institution. In this case, you should come with some casualness because being a stick in the mud is not going to appeal in that space. But also don't let your guard down in the casualness that you take, because you are still a nonblack individual being invited into a black space and given a pulpit to speak to individuals that you need to work on your appeal with.\n\nFor me, something about Biden's statement is reminiscent of Trump's 2016 unscripted campaign trail appeal to black voters: \"What do you have to lose?\" Is that a fair comparison to make?\n\nIt's interesting. I feel like they're both in a similar space. They seem to be telling black people what they should do politically. It comes off as paternalistic, like black people need guidance on what they should do. As my co-author Ismail K. White and I write in Steadfast Democrats , we have frustrations with the literature on race, ethnicity, and politics because there's been this idea that African Americans don't have agency. For one, very little of the literature typically focuses primarily on African American political behavior. And even when blacks are the focus, it should be about giving them an agency and some consideration with respect to the constraints they find themselves in politically. Black people have to navigate a system literally not designed to include them. They've been added into a system that never had them in mind in the first place. So how do you politic in that? How do you engage the structure? And that is just not respected as much as we would want it to be. It assumes an ability of blacks to not understand what they should be considering.\n\nAnd it's not even that what Joe Biden said was wrong. But I think for Trump's statement \"What do you have to lose?\" he actually is wrong, in a lot of ways, in saying that. It assumes there aren't a bunch of reasons that black people wouldn't align with the Republican Party. I think Trump sees himself in isolation, like not within the context of Republican Party history.\n\nSo how is what Joe Biden said not inherently wrong?\n\nBiden is in a situation where he is speaking to the phenomenon that Ismail and I speak to. We argue that partisanship and racial identity for African Americans are very intertwined. In some ways, we've even said, \"to be black is to be Democrat.\"\n\nDemocratic partisanship is such an understood norm of the community, and it's being done that way for a reason. It is through this constrained space that African Americans are in politics - where they're trying to be a voice in a system that is majority-based and they are a minority group on a numerical dimension. So how do you do that? Black people have recognized that what you can do is work together in this structure as a group and throw our weight to the party and candidates that we think represent our group's interests the best.\n\nWe know what our group interests are, and we maintain it by basically calling out the people who seem to not understand the norm, like blacks who decide to be Republican. And it's not that we aren't politically diverse: There are conservative blacks, liberal blacks, progressive blacks, moderate blacks; there are blacks who are socially conservative and economically conservative. There is a lot of political diversity, a lot more than people realize. But we still vote Democrat.\n\nAfrican Americans are extraordinarily aware of the system. They're aware of what they are doing, and they are doing so with such a high level of recognition of the challenges this creates. It's such a strange thing for people to understand. It just doesn't sit with how we have been told politics is supposed to work because it's a group-based politics. And, it doesn't involve white people!\n\nThat's the other part of it - the way we maintain it and build a collective identity around it. How we invoke ways to call out others. And we don't care when people on the outside comment on the way we do it. Black people still do what they do. We still call Kanye West a sell-out, if we think he's a sell-out. And people refer to [black Republican Sen.] Tim Scott that way. Tim Scott came out and said he was saddened [by Biden's comment], as did other black Republicans. After that, black people were like, \"Yeah, whatever,\" because that's how the norm works.\n\nYou talk about there being a spectrum of black Democratic voters. So I'm curious what you think the impact of Biden's statement will be on black progressives, for example. And, two weeks from now, will people remember this or even care?\n\nSeveral years ago, I wrote an article titled \" Black Like Me: How Political Communication Changes Racial Group Identification and Its Implications .\" In that article, I talk about notions of blackness and black identity around this concept of linked fate. I stratify blacks into different groupings - those who are \"chronically included\" (which consists of the highly educated blacks and those with high socioeconomic status who are always at the top of the black agenda or can define the agenda); then there are blacks in the middle, and I call them \"moveable blacks\" mainly because they are encompassing a large set of African Americans, but they're not in this chronically included set.\n\nI feel like the highly educated blacks are going to be the ones who remember this down the line. [ Laughs ] A lot of the black progressives, a lot of upper middle class blacks whose blackness has been questioned and challenged, will remember. Their blackness has been challenged because they are engaging in a lot of spaces, they are highly educated; they're at predominantly white institutions. This hit something within them where they felt like the diversity of the black community and their views are looked down upon or overlooked by the party. Many of those individuals are the progressives and even activists working with grassroots organizations.\n\nBut for large swaths of black people, I don't think this is even on their radar. And even if it is on their radar, they're like, \"Yeah, but it's not wrong.\" And maybe they're bothered that a white person said it, which is valid.\n\nSo what does this mean for voter turnout in November? This isn't the first time Biden has had to walk back comments related to race. Does his ongoing record of this mean he's actively turning away black voters despite what's at stake in the general election?\n\nWhat he needs to be careful with is that those chronically included blacks have access to media outlets. They are in prominent positions, so they can keep this going and keep coming back to it. For the campaign, their attempt to deal with it was to have [Biden's senior adviser] Symone Sanders, who's black, and others try to pivot the way that it was being interpreted. They tried to say he's on Charlamagne's show in the first place, so that displays his commitment to the community. That's what Biden needs to lean into - his commitment to black interests and black communities for those who are in that progressive realm.\n\nAnd he may not get a lot of those voters. He honestly doesn't necessarily need to get that numerically because of just how strong some of the moveable blacks and the other black individuals will be. Younger people who also comprise that progressive set sadly do not turn out in the highest numbers. So that might not be a space where he really needs to make significant inroads. But he definitely doesn't want to piss them off either. I also think it would help if he just announced a VP that was a black woman already. That would be good! [ Laughs ] And Amy Klobuchar's name has been floating around. They need to end that conversation because now they've just stepped in it.\n\nFor this election, there's obviously a choice between Biden and Trump, since they're the major candidates. But there's also a decision between Biden and abstention, a decision to just not turn out. Turnout is the challenge that the party is dealing with. Ismail and I also write about how we don't like the way that people talk about black turnout. They say black turnout went down in 2016 - no, it went back to normal levels. We had the pickup because a black president got elected in 2008 and 2012, which is an anomaly. We need to see the data that way. When it came down in 2016, it went back down to 2004 levels, and that's where black people have stayed. If they're planning on turnout being higher and they're trying to get to Obama levels, I think many things will be motivating to black voters, like getting Trump out of office and now coronavirus.\n\nThis all fits into the broader conversation that Democrats take the black vote for granted. Similarly, we don't see leaders on the right enacting enduring policy that creates real prosperity for the black community. So what's a message you have for black people on how to maintain a sense of dignity and direction as we make voting decisions in a framework that constrains us?\n\nBlack individuals, even the chronically included people (and I am a member of said bougie contingent - I have a PhD; I work at a private liberal arts college; I live in Maine), all of us, shouldn't be ashamed of what we do politically. There's a way in which the concern about the white gaze or what white people think of us starts to become very concerning. I think that's a lot of what we saw on Friday. People were very bothered by a notion that white people are seeing us and this is how they're going to think about us, and that Biden clearly believes this and others are going to look at us and not think we are diverse. I say don't worry about it. I think what we have in strength and power politically is the fact that we do have strength and power politically. It speaks to why Biden even has to apologize. It speaks to the power of what it did in the primaries.\n\nBlack people are making very difficult political decisions in a very constrained space. Many blacks are risk averse because government is slow and clunky. Change doesn't happen overnight. Bernie Sanders's campaign was struggling with this. They were making it sound like they were going to change the world in two presidential terms and black people, especially older blacks in the South, were looking at him like, \"I don't know you. It's never happened. That's not a thing. No one can do that. Give me something more realistic.\" And you see what they did in South Carolina [by voting for Biden in the primary]. Everyone seemed shook, but that was expected. It is a strategic and very informed decision.\n\nI think black people have to be more politically aware than anyone else because of where we are situated in society. We are lucky enough, unlike other communities like American Indian populations, to have the numbers to leverage power, and it's nothing to be ashamed of. I think sometimes people feel shame about it. It makes them feel like sometimes we are collectively \"on the Democratic Plantation\" and that we \"don't have minds of our own or free thoughts.\"\n\nBlack people are thinking; they aren't just blindly making decisions. And even if they don't articulate it the way we are - we are lucky enough to have gone to college, gotten degrees, and have the time, resources, and linguistics to talk about these things - that's okay. If other black people are saying, \"I'm voting for this person because black people are like, 'this is what we do,'\" I don't know how that's any different from any other type of group politics. People are just confused by it manifesting for blacks. We do it for the parties - that's party politics and what all politics is. And people are trying to pretend like it's not.\n\nRight now in the pandemic, there are anti-lockdown people and anti-vaxxers collectively organizing under an identity and behaving in certain ways based on that. I think black people should feel unabashed in what we do. We are doing it, and we are brilliant. And the fact that Biden even has to pay attention to this, and that Trump's campaign has picked up on it, is a signal to how important the black vote is to both campaigns.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nPolls show a tight race. But there are other figures that can help explain where this campaign is headed.\n\nby Nicole Narea\n\nVice President Kamala Harris has pulled slightly ahead in national polls against former President Donald Trump. Still, the race is pretty tight, and it looks like it will remain that way until Election Day.\n\nDespite polling errors that overestimated Democrats' performance in the popular vote in 2016 and 2020, head-to-head polls are still the best signal of what the election outcome will be - though it's important to keep in mind that no single poll will be exactly right, and that some polls have better methodologies than others.\n\nBut head-to-head polling isn't the only way to gauge the state of play. Other election indicators - ranging from approval ratings and sentiments among key groups of voters to economic measures and campaign spending - all provide crucial context about where the electorate and this campaign are headed.\n\nHere are some factors beyond topline numbers that we think are especially crucial to help you gain a fuller understanding of the race.\n\nPresident Joe Biden may have stepped aside from the Democratic nomination, but that doesn't mean he's irrelevant: Biden's approval rating is a proxy for how voters feel about his administration - one whose record Harris has for the most part defended.\n\nIt would be a worrying sign for Harris if that number - which already made Biden historically unpopular before he dropped out - stagnates or goes down before the election.\n\nThat \"would be a negative verdict on the incumbent administration, which she is part of,\" said Kyle Kondik , managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball, a nonpartisan political analysis newsletter, at the University of Virginia Center for Politics. \"I wouldn't take that as predictive on its own, but I do think the president's approval rating still merits watching, even though he's not a candidate anymore.\"\n\nHarris has so far managed to both take credit for Biden's popular policies and decouple herself from his most unpopular policies. Her approval rating is about 42 percent, up from about 38 percent when Biden dropped out on July 21, according to FiveThirtyEight's polling average . Biden, on the other hand, so far hasn't gotten the kind of boost that many people thought he might after dropping out: His approval rating is only up about 2 percentage points to 41 percent.\n\nThat number could be a liability for Harris because \"Republicans are gonna do their damage to connect all of the unpopular things with Biden to Harris,\" Kondik said. \"It's just the question of whether it works or not. I don't think it's worked yet.\"\n\nFor nine years now, more Americans have viewed Trump more unfavorably than favorably. But Trump's favorability is also rising notably, suggesting that he has expanded his appeal.\n\nThat may be because the memory of his first term, when he was incredibly unpopular , has faded somewhat in the public's consciousness. What voters may remember fondly is that the economy was doing well under his presidency until the pandemic hit. Other voters may just like that he's not Harris or Biden.\n\n\"I think to some degree, independents have less of a negative association with him now that he's out of office and has been for a while, and they weren't really happy with the Biden administration,\" said Lakshya Jain , a partner at the political forecasting firm Split Ticket.\n\nTrump has maintained a strong base of support among Republicans, leveraging the numerous indictments against him to make the case that he has been targeted as an anti-establishment candidate. He's also made overtures to moderates, including by somewhat dialing back the restrictive Republican stance on abortion.\n\nAt the same time, however, it would be wrong to say that Trump is popular.\n\n\"I wouldn't say he's cracked through a massive ceiling on favorability, because his negatives are still [high],\" Jain said. Indeed, they're currently more than 10 percentage points higher on average than his favorability ratings.\n\nWhether these unfavorable numbers move as the campaign kicks into high gear in the fall and people get reacquainted with the former president remains to be seen. If they rise, that could signal trouble for Trump on Election Day.\n\nPolls in battleground states suggest that Harris and Trump are practically in a dead heat. That means even the few percent of voters who remain undecided could tip the scales one way or the other. Keeping an eye on these voters will be key to understanding what to expect in each of the swing states.\n\nThat said, it's hard to assess what way they're leaning: Because there are so few undecided voters, pollsters often can't get an accurate read on how they're feeling. Demographically, they tend to be a bit younger and more diverse than the rest of the electorate, and they also tend to skew a bit more female. All of that would \"suggest that Kamala Harris would have more upside with them,\" said David Wasserman , senior editor and elections analyst at the Cook Political Report.\n\nBut that doesn't mean Democrats should assume they now have an edge in swing states. These undecided voters also exhibit traits that might make them lean toward Trump. Wasserman said they are more distrustful of institutions and government, tend to work blue-collar jobs, have less than a four-year college degree, have broad dissatisfaction with the two-party system, and believe that the Biden administration has mishandled the economy.\n\n\"These are cross-pressured voters who may not turn out to vote at all at the end of the day, but that is a group that we're watching closely,\" Wasserman said.\n\nHarris has shown the potential to improve with groups of voters who Biden had struggled with and are projected to play a key role in the election - like independents, Hispanic voters, and infrequent voters.\n\nThat last group was of particular concern for Biden. When he was the nominee, some strategists suggested that higher turnout would hurt Democrats because infrequent voters were less likely to support him .\n\n\"There was an overwhelming sentiment among infrequent voters that Biden would not be able to fulfill his responsibilities for a second term, and for the first half of the year, Democrats were publicly in denial about that,\" Wasserman said.\n\nBut among registered voters who did not vote in 2020, Harris improved by 9 percentage points in New York Times/Siena College polls conducted before and after Biden dropped out , suggesting that she has narrowed Trump's advantage with that group. That growth suggests she has appeal with voters who aren't hardcore partisans - and that she might have further opportunities for growth.\n\nAny significant movement among Black and Latino voters toward Trump is also notable and could prove decisive in certain swing states. In 2020, Trump made gains with Latinos not just in Florida and Texas, but also in Pennsylvania . Black voters will play a key role in Georgia, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, and some of them appear to be moving toward Trump .\n\n\"It's lower-propensity Black voters who are open to voting for Trump, and they are not guaranteed to show up. But even so, if Trump wins 15 percent of the Black vote, that would likely be enough to tip Georgia and Michigan and Pennsylvania to the Republican column,\" Wasserman said. \"That means that Kamala Harris has to make it up somewhere else, and that's hard.\"\n\nTo still win after losing those three states , Harris would likely need to sweep the rest of the swing states and pick up a large state that Democrats have struggled in, like North Carolina.\n\nThat said, Kondik said that he is skeptical any shift among Black voters would be large, and that polling errors might be overstating the extent to which Black voters are supporting Trump. \"I think that's a mirage,\" he said.\n\nIf there's a single issue most likely to determine the election, it's probably the economy, which is at or near the top of issues that voters prioritize across multiple polls . The economy is also worth watching because it has previously had electoral significance.\n\nA key variable in Sabato's Crystal Ball's election forecasting model is economic growth leading up to an election: specifically, second-quarter percent change in gross domestic product (GDP), the total value of goods and services produced in the US.\n\nThat change has \"proven to be historically electorally important,\" Kondik said. Sabato's didn't use it in their 2020 model because the pandemic contributed to a big downturn in economic growth that would have suggested Trump would lose in a landslide, which seemed unlikely - and indeed, he ended up losing what was a tight race.\n\nBut there's no reason to believe that this year is similarly exceptional.\n\n\"If there's a big crash, the incumbent party almost always suffers some sort of penalty. This is kind of what doomed John McCain in 2008,\" Jain said.\n\nThe Federal Reserve started raising interest rates in mid-2022, increasing borrowing costs and dampening consumer confidence in the economy through much of this year. The Fed's goal was to get high inflation under control; now that inflation has cooled, the Fed is expected to finally cut rates again in September .\n\nA rate cut might not be a complete game-changer for Harris, especially since \"a lot of the effect of the economy on the election is already 'baked in' at this late date\" in that most people have already made up their minds about the Biden administration's performance on the issue, said John Sides , political science professor at Vanderbilt University.\n\nHowever, it might give her more ammunition to fight off Republican attacks on Biden's economic record. Not only would it provide some immediate relief to homeowners and homebuyers by bringing down mortgage interest rates, it would also signal that the Fed is willing to step in to help workers in a tougher job market . A rate cut would ease financial pressure on businesses that kept them from hiring as much as they were during the pandemic.\n\nTrump has blamed Harris and Biden for high inflation and household debt and promised to reinstate \" the best economy in the history of our country ,\" which he falsely claimed was during his first term. (His term saw an annual average of between 2 and 3 percent GDP growth , not counting the pandemic economy of 2020, while yearly GDP growth averaged nearly 5 percent in the 1960s .) That has proved persuasive among the majority of voters who prefer him to Harris on the issue, but Harris has also closed that gap somewhat. Harris has argued that she and Biden inherited an economic mess from Trump and have largely managed to clean it up: inflation is down, growth has remained relatively strong , and the labor market is still on solid footing despite a recent downturn in job growth, all without triggering a recession. However, it's not clear how effective that argument is among consumers who are still struggling with higher prices and more debt.\n\n\"In general, I think a rate cut would be a bit of welcome 'good news' for the Harris campaign that might help weaken the Trump campaign's economic argument,\" Sides said.\n\nThe amount of dollars spent in presidential elections by each party isn't necessarily predictive of election outcomes. Piles of cash can't compensate for poor spending decisions or bad candidates. And there are diminishing returns on ad spending.\n\nBut the difference in party spending in major battleground states can reveal something about which party has momentum where, and how competitive they perceive that state to be, Jain said. If one party is being outspent by the other in a particular state, that can indicate one of two things: either they think they already have it in the bag and don't need to spend more, or they've backed off because it doesn't seem winnable and are focusing their resources elsewhere. As of now, Republicans are being outspent in a few battlegrounds where Trump is not polling as well as Harris (though it's very close).\n\nBeyond the major battlegrounds, it's also important to pay attention to spending aimed at expanding the map for either Republicans or Democrats. Any money spent outside Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Georgia, and Nebraska (which allocates three of its five electoral votes to whichever candidate wins the vote in its three electoral districts) might signal as much. Notably, it seems that both parties are planning to spend fairly heavily in states including Texas and Florida this fall.\n\nThat would suggest that Democrats see some path to victory in those traditionally Republican states that isn't immediately obvious to observers lacking their internal polling, that they feel secure enough in other key states to spend money on long shots, or that they feel they have enough money to force the GOP to \"waste\" money on states that should be safe for them.\n\n\"I'm really curious to see if there's any heavy television spending in states other than the big seven, plus Nebraska,\" Kondik said. \"If money is spent in any other place, I'll be interested in that. So, Republicans go on TV in Minneapolis, St. Paul, or Democrats go on TV this fall in Miami.\" Such moves might indicate a party is feeling bullish about expanding the map.\n\nThe lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat - and a closer look at where they should go next.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nHere's why the state's congressional maps were just struck down - again.\n\nby Fabiola Cineas\n\nThe latest battle in the redistricting wars took another turn this week: On Tuesday, a panel of judges struck down Alabama's latest congressional map since it did not follow a court order to comply with the Voting Rights Act.\n\nThe court's decision is the latest in a war over a redistricting plan that could change the balance of power in the US House. The state had originally drawn a map in 2021 that denied Black voters the opportunity to elect a candidate of their choice in almost all of the districts, despite the fact that Black people make up 27 percent of the state's voting-age population. In June, the Supreme Court , in Allen v. Milligan , upheld a trial court ruling striking down the map.\n\nThen Alabama tried again - with a map that, like the 2021 version, still had only one district with a Black majority. According to the judges, Alabama was brazen in its attempt to move forward with the map: \"The law requires the creation of an additional district that affords Black Alabamians, like everyone else, a fair and reasonable opportunity to elect candidates of their choice. The 2023 Plan plainly fails to do so.\" The federal court has ordered a special master to draw three new potential maps to include two districts where Black voters can get the chance to elect candidates of their choice. The court will approve a new map in October.\n\nSimilar fights over congressional and legislative maps are playing out in states including Texas and Georgia. Alabama has already announced its plan to appeal the ruling.\n\nI talked to Michael Li, counsel at the Brennan Center, an organization that tracks voting rights laws and violations, about what is next in the war and what it all means for next year's elections and voters nationwide.\n\nWhy did a panel of three federal judges strike down Alabama's latest congressional redistricting plan?\n\nAlabama gave a middle finger to an earlier ruling of the district court and of the Supreme Court, which ordered it to create a second Black congressional district. Alabama failed to do that and admitted that it failed to do that. What Alabama did is reminiscent of George Wallace standing at the door of the schoolhouse back in the 1960s. The federal court's order was very clear that Alabama needed to create a second district that was either majority black or something quite close to it. Instead, Alabama drew one district to be 40 percent Black and said, \"Well, it's close enough.\" The reality is, given how racially polarized voting is in Alabama, a 40 percent Black district just is not Black enough to give Black voters a chance to win elections.\n\nThe state admitted that, arguing that Black voters win elections and said that was the best the state could do. In the opinion of the three-judge panel, they said it's clear the state didn't even try. Most of the time, states do kind of try by saying something like Black voters win five out of 10 elections, something like that, but Alabama didn't even try.\n\nThe law at the center of this is the Voting Rights Act, specifically Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. What does the law state and how exactly does Alabama's plan violate it?\n\nSection 2 of the VRA requires maps to be redrawn if voting in a state or jurisdiction is so racially polarized that minority voters can't win elections under the maps as they're drawn, but a reasonably configured alternative map would give them that ability.\n\nAlabama is a prime example. In Alabama, white voters overwhelmingly prefer Republican candidates; Black voters overwhelmingly prefer Democratic candidates. That polarization is even more extreme when there's a Black candidate on the ballot. And under those circumstances, it's very easy, whether intentionally or not, to have lines drawn in a way that dilute the vote of minority voters, in this case Black voters. It's easy also to draw many different alternative versions of a district and keep Black voters more together and give them a fair shot at winning an election. That could be a majority Black district or it could be in a district that is just plurality Black.\n\nThat's what the Voting Rights Act does, but there are places in the country where it doesn't apply. It's not a rule that Black voters need to vote in Black districts, Latino voters need to vote in Latino districts, or that Asian voters need to be in Asian districts. The law really responds to whether there is racially polarized voting in a state such that the way that maps are drawn prevents minority voters from reaching political success.\n\nThere are parts of the country where Black voters, even if they're 25 percent of the population, can successfully form coalitions with white voters, with Latino voters, with Asian voters, because the politics are less racialized. That's California, for example.\n\nBut in the South, even 60 years after the Voting Rights Act, people just get very different preferred candidates and that's true even in the Democratic primary. Black voters in the Democratic primary and white voters in the Democratic primary often prefer very different candidates. Voting is just polarized.\n\nAnd what has been the effect of these illegal redistricting plans?\n\nAs the district court found in Alabama, the remedy for a violation has to be effective. It has to give Black voters a fair and reasonable shot at winning an election, not a guarantee, but a fair, reasonable shot. So if you're in a district that is 40 percent Black in the Black belt of Alabama, given the rates of racially polarized voting, Black-preferred candidates were losing every single election by fairly wide margins in many cases. That's an unfortunate function of racialized politics.\n\nAlabama has already said it's appealing this decision to the US Supreme Court and hopes the court will pause the decision, even though the court has already looked at this case. Do you think the court will hear this case again and undo its rulings?\n\nAlabama hasn't really raised any new arguments. It's just rehashing arguments, so I am highly skeptical and very doubtful that the Supreme Court will take this case. I'm even more skeptical that the Supreme Court will stay the ruling. I think what's next is the map will be redrawn by a special master, the court will adopt a map by early October. I think there will be a second appeal. I think the state will appeal the court-drawn map, saying that the court's roadmap somehow violates this or that provision of the Constitution. I think that is the case to watch, potentially. But, right now, the focus is on the state's map. I think the state is very eager to shift the focus to the court's map and say that the court's map is somehow deficient and try to get SCOTUS to block the court's map, which then would leave the state's map in place.\n\nIt feels like time is of the essence here, with primaries coming up. Alabama needs the map for the primary and to be able to reassign voters, print ballots, etc.\n\nYeah, a lot of this is about playing for that state. It's ultimately necessarily about winning. It's about playing for a state that gets you past the next election. With everything on the line, in terms of control of the US House, if they can use that illegal map for 2024 and beyond, I think Republicans are saying we'll take that.\n\nBut the court is also very mindful of how much time you need in advance of a primary. They plan to have a map in place by early October, which is what the state has said it needs. There's a little bit of leeway.\n\nI'd like to talk a little more about the Alabama map. Alabama has seven congressional voting districts. With how Republicans have it drawn, what does this look like on the ground?\n\nYou're right. Alabama has seven congressional districts, and right now, Black voters are able to elect their preferred candidate only in one district. And that's in the seventh, which is heavily Black. Meanwhile, Black voters, especially in the Black Belt region of the state, especially on the eastern side of the state, are divided among multiple congressional districts. And the Black percentage in the rest of the districts is below 30 percent and in some cases only 17 percent. And because the black percentage in these districts is so low, Black voters are politically ineffective. Whereas if you simply reunited Black Belt communities, they'd be effective.\n\nIt makes sense to reconnect Black Belt communities because of a lot of things beyond race. It's a region that has a 400-year history. Across the region, they grow the same crops, they have similar levels of poverty, they have similar needs for representation. The number of people with untreated diabetes or the number of people who are uninsured. If you look at almost any map of the United States that shows differences by county, you can see the Black Belt in Alabama, including if you look at the number of people without a high school degree or the number of people with a college degree or the number of people who get audited by the IRS. The Black Belt has a higher percentage of people who get audited by the IRS.\n\nEven the soil is different in Alabama. The soil of the Black Belt is black because it's where the prehistoric shoreline was. It ended up being very rich soil, which is why people brought slaves there to grow and pick the cotton. So it's not just race. It's a region that stands out in many ways. Everyone knows which counties are in the Black Belt and which are not. The Black Belt is a social, cultural, and economic region that right now is divided among multiple districts, and if you kept them together, not only would you create Black political opportunity, but you would give that region better representation.\n\nRepublicans chose to disregard the court's order and keep the illegal map in place. Ultimately, is this just about trying to control the balance of power in the House?\n\nYes. And to prevent Black people from getting an additional seat at the table. People are very reluctant to give that up.\n\nAlabama's moves are so aggressive and it's hard to make sense of them if you're looking at it from a legal strategy standpoint. It makes more sense looking at it from the standpoint of politics. They're trying to keep control of the House, and this seat will play a big role in that. Speaker McCarthy called down there as they were voting on this map and reminded people that he has a really slim majority. He personally made calls to try to get people to pass an illegal map.\n\nWhy does it feel like these redistricting legal battles are just ongoing and maybe even here to stay?\n\nIt's partially a function of the fact that in America we largely leave redistricting to politicians and politicians oftentimes have other aims, whether it is preserving their own seat or making sure that their party stays in power or targeting political opponents. Whereas in other countries they have more politically neutral ways of drawing maps. In England, there's a boundary condition. In Canada, they have what they call redistribution commissions that redraw districts and they're either career civil servants or other sorts of neutral people. In the US, we have left it as a political process. Now, if you look at states like California, that have adopted independent commissions, those states tend to be much more successful in drawing maps that either aren't challenged legally or where the legal challenges are quickly dismissed because the maps are fair.\n\nAnd so there is a model even within our own country of how you can do this without having so much litigation. For 16 years now, we've drawn maps and litigated about maps. It often means that you don't get final maps until the middle of the decade or sometimes even later.\n\nI think it's become even slower, though, because courts have not been as willing to move fast or rulings get put on hold pending appeal in a way that they didn't before. People think that equity resides with the state and it really should reside with voters who have been found to be discriminated against.\n\nSimilar battles are playing out in places including Texas, Louisiana, South Carolina. How do you think this latest ruling might affect outcomes there?\n\nThe opinion that is key is the Supreme Court's decision upholding the first decision of the panel. There were a lot of questions about how robustly the Supreme Court would interpret section two of the Voting Rights Act going forward. The answer we got in June was very robustly.\n\nThat has put a lot of wind under the sails of advocates bringing cases in states like Georgia and Louisiana under the Voting Rights Act. After the Supreme Court threw out Roe v. Wade last term, a lot of people felt that lots of precedents were on the chopping block, including the Thornburg v. Gingles case , which serves as a basis for how we use Section 2 in redistricting cases. It turns out that the Supreme Court about as strongly as you could hope for said this is the way that you should do it. So we now know what we're supposed to do. So what you see in states like Alabama and Louisiana is a lot of scrambling because I think they thought they were going to win. And now they're sort of scrambling trying to figure out how to try to win. And as you see in Alabama, they haven't quite figured out anything that looks remotely plausible. They're just making the same arguments that they lost on before. It's more like how a 4-year-old would argue and not how you'd expect a state to argue.\n\nWhy do you think the conservative supermajority isn't going in the direction that these states are hoping for them to go?\n\nI think it's in part because the plaintiffs in the case really established a very solid record about the ways that Black political power is diluted in Alabama and how comparatively easy it would be to remedy it just by drawing a slightly different map. The plaintiffs litigated it well, but it might also be that Alabama is a textbook case of how you apply Section 2. If Section 2 doesn't apply in the Black Belt of Alabama, it doesn't apply anywhere. I think people are watching to see whether the Supreme Court is willing to robustly interpret Section 2 when it comes to claims, say, in the suburbs of southern cities where the demographics are much more complicated or the voting patterns are a little bit more complicated.\n\nI don't think anyone thinks we are out of the woods with the Court. In Alabama, the racially polarized voting is so stark and it's even more stark in the rural areas. In those places, white voters overwhelmingly vote Republican. Black voters overwhelmingly vote Democratic, and you have slightly different patterns in some of the suburbs and cities where you have other kinds of people. You have Latinos and Asians sort of mixed in there. So how do you account for those?\n\nWhat makes this moment different?\n\nThere are open disputes about maps pending in about nine states. That really is quite unprecedented. There are VRA claims but also partisan gerrymandering claims in states like Utah and New Mexico and elsewhere. I don't think in, say, 2013 we had nearly as much litigation around the country over maps as we do this decade. It's been more confined in part because now people can bring partisan gerrymandering claims to state court and in part because people are bringing race-based claims in the South in places where they didn't before. In the last decade, nobody tried to get a second Black district in Alabama. Nobody tried to get a second Black district in Louisiana. And now people are bringing those claims.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\n2020 Democratic candidates who aren't Biden still have time to make inroads with black voters.\n\nby P.R. Lockhart\n\nBlack voters are getting a significant amount of attention these days.\n\nIn many ways, it's a welcome development: After years of helping Democrats secure crucial election victories, black voters are being recognized as an influential voting bloc. This was perhaps most notable in 2008 and 2012, where their increased turnout helped deliver the White House to Barack Obama, the nation's first black president.\n\nBut black voters had been wielding their power even before this, in situations like the 1984 Democratic primary , where the support of black voters single-handedly turned Jesse Jackson into a contender, or the 1992 primaries, which saw black voters help Bill Clinton secure the party's nomination. Since the 1990s, black voters have largely backed the candidate that has gone on to win the Democratic nomination, cementing the group's status as powerful players in presidential politics.\n\nBut that does not mean black voters are a monolith.\n\nIn other words, there isn't a single black vote. There are many. A seemingly monolithic black electorate often coalesces only after individual black voters make decisions based on a nuanced set of political calculations.\n\n\"Black voters today are behaving in a very smart and strategic way that they've always behaved in, but no one ever really lets us be smart,\" says Keneshia Grant, an assistant professor of political science at Howard University. \"Black voters get viewed as sheep who are being told where to go, and I think that's wrong and the data shows that this is wrong.\"\n\nBlack voters, much like other voters in the electorate, have varying ideologies. Some are more conservative than others . Some are far more progressive. And there other splits as well, along lines of age, gender, income, and geography. This has always been the case, and yet, it is rarely discussed in mainstream political conversations about courting black voters.\n\nIt's an important reality, though, and could become particularly significant in the current election cycle. While prior elections have shown a united black vote, over the past few months black political journalists, strategists, and academics have made the argument that the 2020 race is incredibly fluid . With so many candidates in play, black voters could potentially spread their vote across multiple candidates in early-primary and caucus states, or push their support to a different candidate than former Vice President Joe Biden, the current frontrunner.\n\nIn fact, a lot of black voters (like voters more broadly) have said they are open to switching to a different candidate or are undecided about who to support, and the next few months of campaigning could be especially important for any campaign hoping to attract as many black voters as possible. Candidates need to do more than black outreach, though: They also must show a clear understanding of black voters, their needs, and their concerns.\n\n\"Based on the different demographics of the black electorate, you do have some people making different choices about who their top candidate is or who their second choice is,\" Adrianne Shropshire, the executive director of BlackPAC, a group focused on increasing black political power, tells Vox. \"That is what is most distinctive about the black vote now. It isn't exactly going en masse to one place.\"\n\nTo understand what's at stake when it comes to winning black voters in 2020, it's helpful to understand how this group has voted in previous elections. A 2019 analysis from NBC News offers one of the most comprehensive histories of black voting behavior for the nine competitive national Democratic primaries that have occurred since exit polling began in the 1970s.\n\nThat project found that black voters have become an increasingly important share of the Democratic Party, going from a bloc that drew national attention as it flexed its muscle during the 1984 and 1988 presidential campaigns of civil rights activist Jesse Jackson - forcing concessions and promises from the Democratic Party in the process - to a group that 20 years later helped Barack Obama gain the electoral advantage necessary for him to clinch the 2008 Democratic nomination.\n\nIn what is perhaps more predicative to the 2020 election, though, the NBC News project showed that black voters have become powerful because of how they vote, with this demographic often rallying around a single candidate as the primary voting continues - but not always before. Securing a high margin of votes from black people can make it easier for candidates to win decisive victories in states with high black populations, helping to tip the nomination toward them.\n\nTake, for example, the aforementioned 2008 Democratic presidential primary. While then-Sen. Barack Obama's success over Hillary Clinton is often remembered - as is the fact that black voters began to overwhelmingly support him after the Iowa Caucus - what often isn't as readily acknowledged is that for months before this, there had been a noticeable split in the black voters backing him and the black voters who weren't. Early in the contest, Obama was supported mainly by younger black voters , as older voters and many black politicians backed Clinton, pointing to her established history in the black community, her work during her husband's presidential administration, and for some, their belief that Obama wasn't well-known enough to be electable .\n\nBut when a majority of this group flipped to Obama in 2008, they helped him advance further, propelling him to a win in South Carolina weeks later. Obama also won every primary held in a state where blacks were more than 20 percent of the population , and in some states, he managed to win over as much as 90 percent of black voters.\n\nThat primary offers a lot of lessons. For one, it shows that the margin of victory for a candidate among black voters matters almost as much as the victory itself, meaning that it's in a candidate's best interest to push their support among black voters as high as it can possibly go. The 2008 primary also provides one example of how black voting power has worked in recent elections: showing how a presumed frontrunner who was banking on black support (Clinton), and actually did have a lot of support from specific groups of black voters and the black political class, saw much of her lead evaporate after a different candidate proved they could also get votes from different portions of the electorate.\n\nAnd after the primary, the 2008 general election also showed that black voters responded well to continued engagement and outreach later in the election cycle, with their turnout reaching historic levels in 2008 and 2012 .\n\nBut if 2008 showed how black voters could help turn a candidate from an underdog to a presidential nominee, eight years later, in 2016, black voters showed how withholding their votes could keep a candidate's chances as a longshot.\n\nIn this cycle, Clinton, again the presumed frontrunner, faced off against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. However, this time, Clinton's lead with black voters held, helping her win the nomination. But there were fractures among black voters that were often overlooked or dismissed in discussions of the contest: a large chunk of young black voters, much as they had for Obama, broke for Sanders early and stayed with him through the primary, and also played a key role in Sanders winning in Michigan . But what differed this time is the fact that Sanders was unable to pull many older black voters to his side.\n\nThe story of black voters in 2016 has largely focused less on the primary than on the general election, with news reports in the immediate days after the November election focusing on how black turnout declined compared to 2008 and 2012. But when it comes to actually understanding differences among black voters, the 2016 primary matters: It shows some important differences among black voters that have only grown more pronounced in 2019.\n\nIn 2016, the differences between Sanders and Clinton supporters weren't just a matter of a younger voter/older voter split or a geographic one. Clinton also did better with black women than black men and attracted more support from more moderate black voters looking to maintain the gains of the Obama era rather than adopt an agenda of radical change. On the other hand, she also got less support from young black progressives looking for a jolt to the system, many of whom criticized Clinton's record on issues like racial justice.\n\nThis reveals some important divides in how black voters settled on her candidacy and shows that while the majority of black voters may have backed Clinton, there were many different reasons and motivations behind why they did (and in some cases did not). More importantly, the way these divides intersect and diverge is critical to understanding the behavior of the black electorate now. Elections may have shown that black voters often become an electoral monolith, but they are far from being an ideological one.\n\n\"Black America is no more monolithic than any other group,\" Theodore Johnson, a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice who studies African American politics and black voter behavior patterns, told Vox. \"Whatever the spectrum is for ideology and politics, black voters are scattered all along that spectrum just like any other racial group.\"\n\nIn the 2020 election cycle, it's likely that we will see high black turnout and enthusiasm. Many black voters will mobilize for a number of reasons: a desire to oust Trump , an interest in a new anti-racist policy agenda in the White House, and a hope for change on the issues affecting their daily lives and communities.\n\n\"Black voters want to back the candidate who is going to win, and in the Trump era, that also means backing the person most likely to push Trump out of office,\" Johnson says.\n\nWith the start of primary voting still a few months away, we can't definitively say who will benefit from this. Currently, polling shows former Vice President Joe Biden having a large lead among black voters , beating his competitors by double digits with this group. Biden is banking on black support, and his team has increasingly indicated that it sees the majority-black South Carolina primary, which will happen on February 29, as critical to his chances of winning the nomination . According to an October poll from Winthrop University , for now, his plan is solid: 46 percent of black voters in South Carolina say he's the most likely candidate to get their support.\n\n\"The black folks support Biden, next to Jesus right now, that's where he is,\" Dot Scott, head of Charleston's NAACP chapter, told Vox's Li Zhou recently , pointing to Biden's deep ties to black communities in the state and his role as Barack Obama's vice president.\n\nWhen the primary began earlier this year, some experts thought things would turn out differently. \"I went into [this election cycle] thinking that this would be a cycle where we would see black voters' political diversity at play,\" Johnson told me. He noted that last winter and spring, the field seemed to be wide open and full of relatively unknown candidates of different ages, racial backgrounds, genders, and political ideologies, potentially leaving black voters to spread out across multiple candidates.\n\nBut that changed once a particular candidate entered the race. \"As soon as Biden jumped in, it sort of ruined the calculus,\" Johnson says of the former vice president's leap to the top of the polls this spring, a position he has maintained (with some stumbles ) in the months since. \"He's such a known quantity.\"\n\nAs I wrote in June , there are a lot of reasons why some black voters started lining up behind Biden early. Some black voters say their support makes sense given their pragmatism, and they believe that Biden is the only \"electable\" candidate who will be supported by more moderate white voters and some conservatives unwilling to vote for Trump. Other black voters place a lot of importance on Biden's role as Obama's vice president and support him due to that history. And some black voters believe that Biden is actually the best policy choice, that his incremental approach to civil rights and call for a return to \"normalcy\" is the right one in this particular moment. There are voters who believe more than one of these things and others who believe all three.\n\n\"There is an aspect of this that is about who can put up the fight that is going to be required to take Trump down,\" Shropshire tells me. \"And some black people know that part of Biden's narrative is that he's a fighter and that he fought for Obama. And that is not insignificant.\"\n\nSome of these arguments have been pushed frequently by the Biden campaign, which has repeatedly emphasized the former vice president's connection to black voters, particularly the older, more moderate voters who regularly turn out for elections. \"They have a sense of who my character is and who I am - warts and all,\" Biden told a group of black reporters in August.\n\nPolling also shows that this group is supporting Biden strongly. An October poll from Morning Consult, for example, found that Biden has 48 percent support among black voters aged 45-54, 53 percent among those aged 55-64, and 56 percent among those 65 and older.\n\nBiden is also quick to remind voters of his role in the Obama administration, which also likely plays a role in these numbers. \"The Biden campaign has been masterful at messaging Biden as the 'great friend and ally of Barack Obama,' who Obama loved so much and chose as his vice president,\" Grant, the Howard University professor, says. \"To the extent that black people are saying that they support Joe Biden, I think that they are supporting who they think has the highest likelihood of being competitive in a general election and their opinion of Barack Obama.\"\n\nHowever, she adds, \"I don't think they like Biden as an independent person who's running and has policies they are enamored with.\"\n\nThis latter point is telling: Given criticism of the former vice president's record on some issues and arguments that he isn't strong enough on matters of racial justice to be the best pick for black voters, there could be an opening for a different candidate to pull support from Biden in the coming months. But that candidate, and anyone else looking to shrink Biden's lead with black voters, needs to be working to make inroads with them now.\n\nWhile Biden might have the majority of the black vote now, his support can't really be taken for granted. Just look what happened to Clinton.\n\nGenerally speaking, at this point, someone defined as a \"black Biden voter\" looks very similar to those who strongly backed Clinton in the early months of the 2008 primary: they're more likely to be older, are more closely aligned with the Democratic Party, and in Biden's case are more interested in returning to a stable state of affairs after Trump than voting for a change agent.\n\nAnd while all of this is currently working in Biden's favor, it isn't a completely sure thing that this will permanently be the case. After all, much like in 2008, many of these voters could still move if they believe another candidate stands a better chance of winning the primary. As Angela Geter, the Democratic Party chair in South Carolina's Spartanburg County, told Vox earlier this month , \"Nobody has it in the bag. Everybody needs to put in the work.\"\n\nIn fact, recent reporting from the New York Times has highlighted that some of the splits among black voters seen in recent elections are already highly noticeable in the current primary contest. Older black women and men, for example, are far more sold on Biden than their younger counterparts, a trend consistent with the 2008 and 2016 primary cycles. A September Essence poll found that black women aged 18-34 ranked Biden fourth, putting him behind Sanders, Harris, and Warren. Older black women, however, ranked Biden first, supporting him in high enough numbers to make him the overall leader in the poll.\n\nAnd while October polling shows that roughly 40 percent of African American respondents support Biden right now, his numbers with black voters under 45 are lower than that. The aforementioned Morning Consult poll, for example, finds that just 32 percent of black voters ages 35-44 support Biden. For the youngest bloc of voters, aged 18-29, this number falls to 29 percent.\n\nThe figures match with what experts tracking black voters of different ages have seen. Those who are not Biden supporters are more likely to be (but aren't exclusively) younger and are often further to the left in their ideology. When they look at Biden, they see not stability but a candidate whose call to return to the Obama era is insufficient to deal with the current political reality - a reality that differs in many ways from what Obama himself faced while in office.\n\nThere are also questions about how Biden would navigate a political landscape that has been further shaped by a surge in activism among the black Left and a growing desire for antiracism among some white liberals . And as Vox's Ezra Klein wrote in September , the fact that Biden differs from the 44th president in terms of style, politics, and demographics means that he \"will not be able to pursue an Obama-like campaign or run an Obama-like administration,\" something that goes against his efforts to present himself as a natural continuation of the Obama presidency.\n\nThere have also a been series of issues on the campaign trail - including Biden's opposition to using busing for school desegregation in the 1970s , his support for the 1994 crime bil l, and his many recent unforced errors when discussing race and policy - that are a large part of the reason why many younger black voters say they're looking to take their votes elsewhere. Some of them are trying to convince their elders to do the same .\n\nMany of these Biden skeptics would likely fall into the roughly 20 percent of respondents who told the Black Census Project earlier this year that the Democratic Party is taking African Americans for granted. And these voters want their chosen candidate to have a clear vision for how they plan to fight racism and aid the black voters who help deliver the nomination and, they hope, the presidency.\n\nPerhaps recognizing this, some candidates trailing Biden with black voters have fought to make inroads with specific groups separate from the often older and typically more moderate black voters Biden is currently leaning on.\n\nSanders, for example, has worked to build on the connections he established in 2016 with younger progressive black voters and he has also worked on outreach to other black voters attracted to his calls for a political revolution.\n\nHarris has targeted black women , who are among the most consistent black voters. In the wake of critiques from some African Americans that a black woman can't win against the current president, she has also been more proactive than other candidates in going after Trump.\n\nBooker, the only other black candidate, has noticeably struggled to find an exact lane with black voters. But he has focused on highlighting a message of hope and justice while speaking with mannerisms of the black church, suggesting that for now at least, he is likely looking to peel voters from any of the other candidates.\n\nOther candidates have largely used issue agendas and discussions of racial justice, be they platforms focused on specific issues like police violence and reform (Julián Castro) or larger \"black agenda\" platforms addressing a number of issues comprehensively (Pete Buttigieg) when making appeals to black voters.\n\nIn another primary cycle, these pitches - and the fact that the Democrats have the most diverse primary field in history - might have been more persuasive to black voters. But right now, many these candidates, and especially the candidates of color, haven't really risen to the top of the list for many black voters.\n\nThe candidate who currently faces the biggest pressure to reach black voters - and also stands to make the biggest gain with black voters as of now - is Warren, who has seen her level of national support among black voters increase several points in recent months but has not done well enough yet to catch Biden. In the coming months, her efforts to make inroads might face additional hurdles among some groups of black voters who value familiarity and name recognition.\n\nWarren's strategy has largely revolved around using her policy proposals - from her plan to provide support to historically black colleges and universities and black students struggling with student loan debt to her plans for black women worried about maternal and infant mortality - to highlight various ways that racial injustice has affected black Americans' quality of life. And as she works to cut into Biden's lead in South Carolina, Warren is also trying to build connections with black community leaders in an effort to grow her base of support.\n\nThose efforts are being watched closely by black voters, and they could become extremely important in the coming months. \"She's playing the long game - black voter outreach isn't something where you do it well for a month and then see voters swing,\" says Johnson. \"But if Biden stumbles, she's there to pick up all of that support because she's putting in the work now.\"\n\nOf course, all of this talk about black voters and the differences between them overlooks something else about black voters a few months before the first primary contests: A lot of them are still undecided about who they will vote for. In fact, some polls show that this undecided group is arguably bigger than the voters who have sided with any of the candidates in the field.\n\nAn August poll from Pew , for example, found that while Biden held the lead among black voters, 45 percent of black voters polled weren't currently supporting a candidate. The more recent Winthrop University poll found that while 46 percent of likely black voters in South Carolina currently support Biden, 44 percent of black respondents said they might change their mind about who they are supporting and 9 percent said they don't know yet who they are voting for. Just 41 percent said they were very sure about their vote.\n\nLooking at the specific groups of black voters candidates are courting - like young voters and black women - a lot of them remain undecided, too. In June, the University of Chicago's GenForward Survey found that 24 percent of young black respondents aged 18-36 said they would support someone not currently in the primary race. In September, the aforementioned Essence poll found that roughly one-quarter of the black women it contacted were undecided.\n\nThis suggests that black voters are carefully weighing their options and are looking at multiple candidates or, in the cases of other black voters dissatisfied with the options, are deciding if they will vote at all. And coming after years of black political strategists arguing that the Democratic Party needs to do a better job of engaging with black voters beyond eleventh-hour calls for them to get out the vote on Election Day, what happens in the coming months could be especially important to convincing some black voters that they should turn out next November.\n\n\"The party is going to have to get the people who haven't been participating to participate,\" Grant says, noting that some undecided or infrequent black voters \"will support the person who went and got them.\"\n\nHow candidates go and get voters will depend on their outreach. Polls of black voters have shown that there are multiple priorities for different groups, including issues like health care, education, climate change, racism, and criminal justice. Who black voters, individually, will ultimately vote for is far from settled. Their process of determining who to support can't be reduced to simple statements about a universal \"black vote.\"\n\n\"It would be a misjudgment for people to think that any of these numbers are baked,\" says Shropshire. \"There's just so much time left.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

      "text": "Black and Arab American voters could swing Michigan's 2024 election\n\nOur third deep dive into polling and other data in the seven swing states.\n\nThe entire nation will vote on the next president of the United States this fall, but the election will likely come down to seven key swing states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada , North Carolina , Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. With the outsized importance of these states, it's worth taking a closer look at the data we have in each of them - not just where the presidential race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump stands today, but also each candidate's path to victory and what issues could tip the election. Third in our series is the Great Lakes State, Michigan.\n\nMichigan's status as a presidential swing state is a somewhat new phenomenon. While Republicans have frequently won state and local offices over the last few decades, the state only recently became a true battleground at the presidential level. From 1992 to 2012, Democratic presidential candidates consistently won Michigan by around 5 to 10 percentage points. But in 2016, Trump flipped the state , winning by a razor-thin margin of 0.2 points.\n\nMichigan Democrats have fared quite well since then, winning every statewide office twice and flipping the state legislature along with multiple U.S. House seats. In 2020, President Joe Biden won the state by 3 points, his largest margin among the core seven swing states that year . But Republicans are still gunning hard for the state's 15 electoral votes, and the 2024 data shows they have a realistic chance of winning them this year.\n\nHarris currently leads Trump by about 2 points in 538's presidential polling average of the race.* That's an inversion of where the race stood before Biden dropped out, however, when Trump was leading by a little over 2 points.\n\nBlack voters make up about 13 percent of Michigan's electorate, and in 2020, 92 percent supported Biden, according to exit polls . But so far in 2024, Harris seems to be running way behind that benchmark. An average of polls conducted in Michigan since Sept. 4 shows the Democratic share of the Black electorate dropping by a precipitous 21 points on margin since 2020.** That would be a truly seismic shift in Michigan politics, but there are reasons to believe those numbers may not fully materialize come Election Day.\n\nIn 2022, national polls estimated a huge drop in Democratic support among Black voters - but the decline ended up being only a couple of points . Indeed, in Michigan's governor's race, the 2022 Democratic share of the Black vote mostly held steady from 2020, either rising or falling a couple of points, depending on the estimate .\n\nEvery year is different, and polling errors from one cycle don't necessarily carry over to the next . So we can't say with any certainty that the same phenomenon is happening again this cycle ... but we can speculate. A 21-point shift on margin among Black voters would be a political earthquake in Michigan, and as of now, the likelier explanation is probably something closer to 2022, when polls struggled to capture a full picture of the Black electorate.\n\nRecent polls also show a large drop in Democratic support among young voters. An average of polls conducted in the state over the last month shows Democratic support among 18- to 29-year-olds declining by 13 points on margin from 2020.\n\nYoung voters are key to any Democratic victory, but especially so in Michigan, which had the highest youth turnout in the nation in the 2022 midterms. College students in particular are sure to play a pivotal role in both the presidential election and in key U.S. House races across the state. While polls sometimes have a hard time capturing a representative sample of young voters, after a year marked by intense student protests over the Biden administration's handling of the war between Israel and Hamas, Democrats have their work cut out for them to claw back support among the demographic.\n\nAnd young voters aren't the only key demographic in Michigan that has been upended by the war in Gaza. Arab Americans make up about 4 percent of the state population (the highest share of any state in the country), and many prominent Arab American leaders in the state have harshly criticized the Biden administration's response to the conflict. These critiques helped galvanize the Uncommitted Movement, which encouraged votes against Biden in the Democratic presidential primary earlier this year. And since becoming the Democratic nominee, Harris has been dogged by pro-Palestinian activists in Michigan, with protestors interrupting an August rally in Detroit.\n\nIn 2020, Arab Americans nationwide leaned heavily toward Democrats . But according to a new national poll conducted by John Zogby Strategies for the Arab American Institute, that advantage isn't likely to continue this year. Trump and Harris are about tied in the low 40s in the survey of Arab American voters, a far cry from the 24-point advantage that Biden had in 2020. While support for Trump among the demographic has grown about 7 percent since 2020, much of the change comes from collapsing Democratic support, which has dropped by 18 percent since 2020.\n\nPart of that could be because GOP policies on Israel are even less appealing to many anti-war activists than the Democrats', so many disenchanted Arab American voters may choose to either stay home on Election Day or vote for a third-party candidate rather than mark their ballots for Trump. Indeed, third-party candidates are pulling 12 percent of the vote among Arab Americans nationally in the Zogby poll, much higher than the 3 percent they received among the demographic in 2020 and far more than we've seen in polls of the general population . This was a national survey, not specific to Michigan, but given the state's competitiveness, any Democratic decline among this group of voters could still help the GOP's chances.\n\nThe most important issues to Michiganders this election are in some ways the opposite of what you might expect. Of course, the economy dominates Michigan voters' concerns in the same way it does nationwide . But an issue like abortion, which appeared to have been mostly settled in the state, still ranks high in voters' minds, on par with voters nationally. Meanwhile, an issue like the war between Israel and Hamas, which is especially important in Michigan, may not be as singularly motivating as expected.\n\nMichigan was one of the first states in the country to legalize abortion after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Voters in 2022 passed Proposition 3 , a constitutional amendment that guaranteed the right to an abortion up until fetal viability. The year after that, the state legislature expanded reproductive rights even further , making Michigan one of the most protected states for abortion rights in the Midwest.\n\nAfter this dramatic expansion of abortion rights in the state, some signs indicated that Michiganders would be less motivated by the issue in 2024 than voters in other states. But new polling shows that abortion is still one of the top issues for Michigan voters. In The New York Times/Siena College's latest poll of the state , 16 percent of registered voters said that abortion was the most important issue in determining their vote in November, the second-most frequent response behind the economy.\n\nThat figure mirrors a recent nationwide poll from the same pollster that showed 14 percent of voters listing abortion as the most important issue. National and state-level polling from Emerson College also shows abortion mattering to Michiganders roughly as much as it does to voters nationwide.\n\nThat's probably welcome news to Democrats in the state, who are trying to capitalize on the issue by warning that the state's new abortion protections could be steamrolled by a national abortion ban if the GOP wins control of Congress. But some Michigan Republicans remain skeptical that the issue will end up motivating many voters in the state come Election Day, given the network of protections already in place.\n\nBut while abortion ranks higher in importance among Michiganders than some expected, another issue that has rocked state politics in the last year is barely registering among voters' top priorities.\n\nAs I wrote earlier, the war in Gaza has been a mobilizing issue for many Michiganders, particularly Arab Americans and young voters. But less than 1 percent of respondents in The New York Times/Siena College Michigan survey said that \"the Middle East/Israel/Palestinians\" was most important to their vote.\n\nThat certainly doesn't mean that less than 1 percent of the state's residents care about the topic (the survey only asked what the most important issue was for respondents), but it does indicate that the war may not be top-of-mind for Michigan voters as a whole in the way that many observers predicted - in line with what we've seen nationally , including among younger voters .\n\nThe presidential race isn't the only close contest in Michigan this year - the state is hosting competitive fights for a U.S. Senate seat, two U.S. House seats and control of the state House.\n\nIn the state's U.S. Senate race, Rep. Elissa Slotkin is hoping to keep the seat in Democratic hands following the retirement of Sen. Debbie Stabenow. She faces former Rep. Mike Rogers, a Republican who used to represent much of the same Lansing-area turf that Slotkin now holds, following the state's redistricting . 538's polling average of the race shows Slotkin with a lead of about 5 points.\n\nWhile the state's U.S. Senate seat may be a harder win, Republicans are trying to at least capture a few of Michigan's U.S. House districts. In the 7th District, the GOP is hoping to capitalize on Slotkin's departure from the House by boosting former state Sen. Tom Barrett, who lost to Slotkin in 2022. Barrett seems to have an advantage in the polls over his Democratic rival, former state Sen. Curtis Hertel Jr., though two of the three publicly released polls of the race were internals from the Barrett campaign.\n\nIn the 8th District, former Trump administration official Paul Junge is locked in a close race with Democratic state Sen. Kristen McDonald Rivet to replace retiring Democratic Rep. Dan Kildee. Junge is a twice-failed candidate for Congress but has outraised McDonald Rivet. No matter who wins, it will be the first time in almost 50 years that a member of the Kildee family has not held Michigan's Flint-based district.\n\nFurther down the ballot, Democrats in the state legislature are hoping they can hold on to control of the state House of Representatives after winning the chamber by the narrowest of margins in 2022. As of August, Democratic state House candidates had outraised their Republican counterparts by about $4 million , giving them a massive cash advantage in a set of races that often fly under the radar. But Democrats are playing defense in more districts than the GOP is; Republicans only need to flip two seats to win control of the chamber and end the Democratic trifecta that has governed the state for the past two years.\n\n*All numbers in this article are as of Oct. 3 at 2 p.m. Eastern.\n\n**Based on polls of likely and registered voters only (if a poll included results among both populations, we used likely voters).

      "text": "'The View' on how the black community's vote will determine 2020 Dem candidate after South Carolina results\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden was victorious in the South Carolina primary.\n\nAfter several shifts in the Democratic race for the 2020 presidential nomination this past weekend, \"The View\" co-hosts discussed the importance of the black community's vote and its impact on the election.\n\nFormer South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and billionaire businessman Tom Steyer both suspended their campaigns. Churchgoers at the historic Brown Chapel AME Church in Selma, Alabama, dismissed Former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg during a campaign stop. And, after an endorsement from South Carolina's Rep. Jim Clyburn , former Vice President Joe Biden went on to win the state's primaries with 39 delegates, catapulting him into second place among the other candidates.\n\nAfter \"The View\" co-host Whoopi Goldberg mentioned that Biden's win would give \"him a lot of momentum going into Super Tuesday,\" co-host Sunny Hostin spoke to the influence that the black vote has on choosing a Democratic nominee.\n\n\"Once again, black voters show that they are the heart and soul of the Democratic party - the most reliable voters in the Democratic party - and they showed out for him in large numbers,\" Hostin said. \"I don't think you can underestimate Clyburn's endorsement of Biden.\"\n\n\"There has to be some retooling for the campaign,\" Hostin continued. \"But [Biden] certainly goes into Super Tuesday with the momentum that I think he has needed for so long to sort of recapture, again, the soul of our country. I'm just very, very happy that he's where he is right now.\"\n\nGuest co-host Ana Navarro said Biden's win \"changes the entire narrative\" of the race to the White House.\n\n\"The African American vote showed up for him because Joe Biden has showed up for the African American vote for years,\" Navarro said.\n\n\"People running for office need to learn and understand that you don't just show up to the church the Sunday before election and expect to get the vote,\" Navarro continued, referring to churchgoers who turned their backs to Bloomberg as he spoke to them at the Brown Chapel AME Church. \"It takes years of developing a relationship, of having reliability, of being able to confide in each other, of knowing that you're there.\"\n\n\"The question for many Democrats is not just the difference between socialism and a more traditional Democratic candidate. It's if you're going to gamble with the African American vote, which I think everyone can agree is vital to winning the White House,\" co-host Meghan McCain said of Biden's South Carolina win. \"It's between Bernie and Biden right now. There's no other two people in the race. It is gonna be an absolute cage match going into Super Tuesday.\"\n\nFourteen states and American Samoa will head to the polls on Tuesday, giving candidates a chance to win 1,344 of the 1,991 delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination.\n\nMcCain said she thinks Texas will be a large deciding factor in the day's voting.\n\n\"Bernie, actually, is really seriously in play in Texas. California is more than likely going to go to Bernie,\" McCain said.\n\nSaying that \"black voters are key\" in North Carolina, Hostin predicted that Biden will win there, but said she wasn't as certain in other states.\n\n\"I'm not so sure about California, but Texas hasn't always been friendly to Sanders,\" she said. \"He lost Texas to Clinton because, again, of that minority vote.\"\n\n\"[Bernie Sanders] does very well with hispanic voters,\" McCain responded, making a distinction that \"there's a difference between Latino voters and Hispanic voters.\"\n\n\"It's a huge difference between the Hispanic population in Texas and the Latino vote in Florida,\" she said. \"There's a huge delineation between people that have had family members that have fled from Castro and people who have come from Latin America, and there does seem to be a huge fracture between these two voting boxes with Bernie going forward.\"\n\nThe co-hosts also spoke about the churchgoers who protested Bloomberg's campaign appearance Sunday.\n\n\"This was really damning for Mike Bloomberg,\" McCain said. \"I want to know what Mike Bloomberg's path is if he doesn't get any delegates in Super Tuesday, which it's looking like he won't.\"\n\nHostin shared a warning to politicians who follow in Bloomberg's footsteps.\n\n\"I caution these politicians: Stop trying to show up at the black church on a Sunday when you never been at the black church before,\" she said. \"You've got to be there for the community. Don't try to go to the black church. You can't just show up and not really be invested in the community from day one. You can't do it.\"\n\n\"I want his money to show up, because he's done a lot of good things with his money particularly in the last few years since leaving [office as mayor],\" Navarro said. \"Mike, maybe not for president, but we'll take your cash.\"\n\nDespite his historic run for president, one of Buttigieg's political shortcomings was his lack of support from black voters . And with minority voters making up nearly a third of the electorate, that could have called Buttigieg's viability into question.\n\n\"He made it easier for LGBTQ people to live their truth, showed that you can be gay - be who you are - and still run for president and run for big things and not have to hide your identity,\" Navarro said.\n\n\"He talked about faith very openly,\" Navarro continued. \"The way he was getting ahead was not by dividing people into groups... It was about bringing people together.\"\n\n\"What I really liked about him was that he was interested in what could be done better,\" Goldberg said. \"Whoever is running, I always want to feel like they're running for the heart of the country and not the heart of the party.\"\n\n\"So wherever we end up,\" Goldberg continued, \"feet should be held to the fire so that the people are actually getting more bang for their buck than we've gotten in the last several years.\"\n\nEvery episode of ABC's award-winning talk show \"The View\" is now available as a podcast!
