      "text": "How the manosphere found its way into the Black community\n\nIn the summer of 2023, I read that YouTube had demonetized a podcast called \"Fresh & Fit,\" meaning that the show could no longer earn ad revenue.\n\nWhile YouTube didn't point to an inciting incident, the podcast had recently come under fire for hosting white supremacist Nick Fuentes. During the episode , Fuentes had called women \"baby machines\" and denied the existence of the Holocaust.\n\nUntil then, I hadn't heard of \"Fresh & Fit.\" But once I learned that the hosts were two young Black men, Myron Gaines and Walter Weekes , I wanted to learn more about what they were saying on their show - and how they said it.\n\nThe show is part of the \"manosphere\" : online places where men have conversations for, with and about men. Journalists and scholars generally describe younger white men as the most common audiences for manosphere influencers.\n\nAs a researcher of male-dominated spaces , I wondered: Were Gaines and Weekes specifically trying to target Black male followers? And, if so, how were they pulling this off?\n\nAs I listened to their episodes, I started noticing something interesting - the two hosts regularly used language to appeal to Black men. They spoke in the parlance of social justice movements, but applied it, in a twisted way, to justify misogyny and male superiority.\n\nI study male subcultures such as gaming and the military to see the types of rhetoric and behaviors that get rewarded and which kinds of topics are avoided.\n\nThere's the widespread belief that men don't express their feelings well or have a hard time being vulnerable.\n\nThe manosphere purports to upend that notion . On podcasts, YouTube series and discussion boards, men get into the weeds about their lives, their relationships and the challenges they face.\n\nSome have argued that these interviews, posts and threads can be healthy and productive . But the manosphere generally evokes controversial internet personalities such as Andrew Tate and Jordan Peterson , who have become notorious for their misogynistic and homophobic tirades. Tate doesn't just say outrageous stuff - he's been charged with sex trafficking and is awaiting trial in Romania.\n\nTo Tate and Peterson, being a better man isn't about learning to be more vulnerable. Instead, they argue that straight men have become marginalized in a society that's gotten too soft, too effeminate and too politically correct. In their view, men need to embrace their traditional roles as protectors, providers and producers.\n\nResearch has shown that young men in particular are receptive to these ideas . Of course, young Black men make up some of this cohort. But they rarely get mentioned in critiques of the manosphere.\n\n\"Fresh & Fit\" bills itself as a discussion on men's fitness, fashion and mental health.\n\nGaines is author of the book \" Why Women Deserve Less ,\" in which he writes, \"Women are benefiting unfairly at nearly every man's expense.\"\n\nWeekes is a business mogul who firmly believes in meritocracy; he credits his success to his own hard work, a point he eagerly reiterates on a number of episodes.\n\nThe show normally involves commentary from the hosts about current events, and they'll often feature guests ranging from CrossFit coaches and gym owners to more controversial interviewees like Fuentes and conservative political commentator Candace Owens .\n\nThe YouTube shows are wildly popular, with some episodes garnering hundreds of thousands of views.\n\nThere's also a spinoff, \"Fresh & Fit After Hours,\" which tends to include panels of young women. During these conversations, the women - who usually work in fields such as modeling, sex work or professional dance - often find themselves put on the spot by the hosts, who ask them to speak on behalf of all women.\n\nI listened to 40 randomly selected episodes of the main show and 25 of the \"After Hours\" show, and the conversations veered into explorations of gender differences and debates about why men are better than women. All of these elements fall under what sociolinguist Scott Kiesling calls \"masculine linguistic practices\" - the ways in which men express their masculinity in conversation with one another.\n\nEach episode is replete with misogyny. On one, Gaines encourages listeners to not go to Miami - not because it's too expensive or it's too hot, but because the women in South Beach think they're \"better than you.\" On another, when talking about what men are looking for in a partner, he notes, \"When we look for security in y'all, it's security in making sure the kid is ours. And a woman that has a promiscuous past might continue that trend in the future.\"\n\nGaines and Weekes do give a platform to women - but it's to women who echo the hosts' warped theories on gender.\n\nIn several of the \"Fresh & Fit After Hours\" episodes I watched, the hosts booked female guests who often admitted that they are status-conscious opportunists - that they want to be taken care of, that they expect men to give them gifts, and that they should be treated \"like a lady.\"\n\nIn one episode of \"After Hours,\" when a guest says she wishes men could approach her without being overly flirtatious, Gaines is quick to undermine her: Surely she gets approached by men every day. But are they all flirtatious?\n\nThen he throws out another question: How many of the men she ended up dating hadn't flirted with her?\n\nShe holds up her hand in the shape of a zero.\n\nWatching \"Fresh & Fit\" also showed me how the hosts sought to specifically appeal to Black viewers and listeners.\n\nI think it's important to note that although Black men are highly susceptible to being seen as a collective group, they aren't a monolith. Many Black men hold conservative views . Instances of homophobia, misogyny and transphobia are as common among Black Americans as they are among white Americans.\n\nIn other words, there isn't any sort of cultural insulation that would protect Black men from negative messages in the manosphere, and the hosts subtly use language and imagery common to Black culture to inculcate Black listeners to their views.\n\nGaines and Weekes invariably slip in and out of African American Vernacular English, which conveys not only authenticity but also forges a connection with Black listeners .\n\nAdditionally, a common theme is the degree to which men are being \"kept down.\" In the context of their show, \"kept down\" refers to the ways in which women constrain them. But in Black culture, the phrase is commonly used to talk about the ways in which the dominant white culture forces them to behave or act a certain way .\n\nCriminal law scholar Paul Butler refers to the impact of those stereotypes about Black men as \" black male exceptionalism .\"\n\nTo Butler, commonly repeated statistics about Black men - their higher incarceration rates, worse education outcomes and lower employment rates - reinforce the idea of Black men as an \" endangered species .\" My upcoming research expands on this, exploring how the internalization of this exceptionalism can be a self-fulfilling prophecy.\n\nThe darker corners of the manosphere stoke beliefs about disenfranchisement and discrimination against men. So it's worth pointing out that these messages can easily resonate among minority men, too.\n\nIf they listen to Gaines and Weekes, they'll come away from the episodes thinking that it isn't just racism keeping them down: It's women, too.\n\nSteven Dashiell , Assistant Research Professor, Morgan State University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "text": "Why It Was So Easy For Rachel Dolezal to Slip Into Black Skin\n\nSo let's talk about Rachel Dolezal. You may already know the basics of Dolezal's case: she's the 37-year-old head of the NAACP chapter in Spokane, Washington; a professor of Africana studies at Eastern Washington University; and-here's where it gets kinda bananas-a white woman who has been passing as a black woman for years.\n\nWe know this not because of any misstep Dolezal made-she was essentially flawless in executing her ruse-but because her biological parents, from whom she's been estranged for years, decided to go on television and announce it. Dolezal, as it turns out, isn't actually African American at all, but German, Czech and Swedish, with a hint of Native American in there somewhere. In other words, the Rachel Dolezal story is a lot like Black Like Me , brought to actual 2015 life.\n\nThe whole thing might be a non-story if our long and twisted history of passing, which has roots that can be traced back to our country's very foundation, weren't understood to operate in only one direction. Some very fair black people, as a refuge from racism and persecution, have passed for a long time. Theophilus John McKee lived as a white man for four decades before his blackness was uncovered in 1948. This discovery may have helped kill him, considering he died of heart failure around five months after word got out. Writer Anatole Broyard only revealed his years of passing to his children on his deathbed. James Meredith had to have the National Guard protect him when he integrated Ole Miss in 1962, but the joke was on those dumb racists: Harry S. Murphy (who briefly passed for white and enrolled in the school from 1945-'46) had already attended the college undetected.\n\nBut Dolezal confounds our understanding of how passing is supposed to work. How many white people, given anonymity, would take the opportunity to become black? For the most part, even peddlers of the most bullshit \"post-racial\" and \"colorblind\" philosophies would opt to remain white, if they answered honestly. White privilege is a precious commodity.\n\nWhich is why Dolezal fascinates us. She flipped the script, and instead was committed to being black, going to great pains to make it so. This is a woman who attended Howard University, a historically black college, on full scholarship to earn her MFA. (Though new reports suggest she hadn't yet begun passing during her time there.) Her art, if her blog offers any insight into her larger body of work, is almost singularly focused on representations of blackness and messages of anti-racism.\n\nI don't doubt that Dolezal loved her black ex-husband (you would have to love someone to forgive them for writing you this love song ), but their marriage definitely fit neatly with the rest of the package. She adopted her African-American brothers, who had originally been adopted by her parents, and began calling them her sons. She kept up her tan unfailingly. And as Kara Brown noted at Jezebel , she must've spent a small fortune making her hair into a flawless version of every natural hairstyle known to black womanhood.\n\nAnd it worked, at least for a few years. Dolezal, like Black Like Me 's John Howard Griffin, couldn't change her blue eyes, but it actually didn't matter. She presented as a convincing fair-skinned African-American woman because there are plenty of bonafide black Americans who look like Dolezal. Our nation's legacy of slave rape, of hidden miscegenation that produced babies who looked an awful lot like the master, of secret relationships that ended with black men strung from trees-you know, the things so many of us like to pretend never happened just because we have a black president-all of these things have yielded African Americans of every hue and skin tone. Dolezal knew that racism requires whiteness be fragile, rendering anything that deviates even slightly from white-that falls under the one drop rule -non-white. Turning black was easy, a skin she could slip into, because the signage of blackness is so easily acquired. White supremacy couldn't maintain itself without exclusivity. A deep tan and a perm (and on a few occasions, locs and braids) was enough to get herself pitched out of the most elite club.\n\nDolezal has spent the last few years performing blackness, a role to which she was welcomed by unknowing members of the black community. (If black privilege or even reverse racism were real, entry would have eluded her.) Ask anyone who believes in respectability politics-the absurd idea that if (mostly) black people would just do the work of being whiter, racism would disappear-if that magic trick would work for the majority of African Americans.\n\nOr better yet, ask any black millionaire if racism has ceased to exist. You cannot \"whiten up\" because real whiteness is only for white people in this country. A key part of our history of passing for white is that it could get you killed; it was a very high-risk, high-yield investment. Playing at being white, gaming the system to take advantage of privilege that was meant to be off limits to you, was tremendously dangerous. To make extra certain that no people with even one drop of black blood were able to access that privilege, a number of states passed laws narrowing the definition of whiteness, including the Virginia Racial Integrity Act in 1924. The effects of those laws are still with us today. I am a \"light-skinned\" black woman and I guarantee you, were I to suddenly declare myself white tomorrow, an awful lot of (white) people would have serious problems with the idea, and possibly consider me insane.\n\nWhich is why this notion of transracialism, a made-up term that's surfaced in the wake of Dolezal's story, is so ridiculous. Social media is currently full of attempts to equate Dolezal's situation with that of Caitlyn Jenner. Conservatives, who never bought into this whole \"trans\" thing anyway, have wondered aloud (mostly to be provocative) why, if Caitlyn Jenner is a woman, Rachel Dolezal can't be black. But Caitlyn Jenner didn't just become a woman; as a trans person, she has been a woman for as long as she can remember. She's finally taken the step of having her exterior self correlate with who she always knew she was inside. Rachel Dolezal, until some number of years ago, was white: a person who identified as white, with a strong appreciation for blackness and black culture. But you cannot translate a love of a culture into a completely revamped identity. To pretend that one can merely snap her fingers and become black is silly.\n\nNot to mention audacious. And a sign of privilege itself. How ballsy is it not only to pretend to be black, but to wield it as part of what makes you ideal to head up your local NAACP? (For the record, the NAACP is an interracial organization; Dolezal could have held the position without the whole performance.) There's been a lot of writing on cultural appropriation and cooptation over the last few years, but Dolezal's story is a version of both that sounds so outlandish on its face it would be funny if the whole thing weren't so troubling. You cannot just make someone else's oppression your own because you are a passionate ally (that's actually doing the ally thing all wrong).\n\nPart of what led to the investigation of Dolezal's background were her repeated claims of racial har assment over the years. I would never, ever wish that anyone be subjected to racism, but I will say that I deeply and sincerely hope Dolezal didn't make up those claims to bolster her claims to black authenticity. That would do a tremendous disservice to us all, especially those of us who live with the real, unchosen-and often disbelieved-consequences of racism.\n\nI believe Rachel Dolezal started off as a white woman who had a deep and real interest in African-American arts and culture, in social justice, in being a principled adherent to the tenets of civil rights. And then something went off the rails. I cannot speak to the ruptures that seem to have occurred alongside her decision to \"become black\"-her refusal to speak to her family, and her continued insistence that she wants nothing to with them. For all any of us know, they could be wonderful parents who have done nothing wrong, or monsters with a daughter who made a terribly misguided attempt to escape her past. I do not know Dolezal's mental state, and I'm pretty sure the publications I've seen speculating about it should probably just stop it right there.\n\nBut what we can say is that Dolezal's advocacy for black people and black culture didn't have to be done from within black skin. And the assumption that it could be so easily forged, that she could speak to the experience of life as a black person (and here I mean literally; Dolezal often lectured on this stuff as if it were taken from her own background) without ever actually having had it, is offensive. And ironically, able to do less good. The sad reality of race in this country is that many white people tend to listen to and believe other white people more on matters of race and anti-racism than they do people of color. Rachel Dolezal would actually be a more effective voice against racism in her own white, privileged skin.\n\nI'm not sure what Rachel Dolezal's next steps are, but hopefully, they involve becoming herself again, and sharing the ideals she seems to believe in, which so many people could benefit from learning about. Only this time, as her real, authentic self."

      "text": "White America Is Oblivious to the Truth About Black Poverty\n\nThere's been a fascinating debate over the past few weeks between Ta-Nehisi Coates from the Atlantic and New York magazine's Jonathan Chait regarding the language President Obama employs in addressing African-American communities. Obama's been criticized by Coates and other supporters for using rhetoric that reinforces the belief shared by many on the right, that personal initiative and hard work is sufficient to overcome the obstacles confronting many young black men despite the continued existence of institutional racism in education, employment, healthcare, criminal justice and civic participation (to name a few).\n\nChait replied with, \"I agree that racial discrimination persists, but I don't believe this fact abnegates the possibility that a culture of poverty exists as well.\" Chait believes President Obama is uniquely suited to speak to black people about changing self-destructive behavior:\n\nBut Coates is committing a fallacy by assuming that Obama's exhortations to the black community amount to a belief that personal responsibility accounts for a major share of the blame. A person worries about the things that he can control. ....Obama's habit of speaking about this issue primarily to black audiences is Obama seizing upon his role as the most famous and admired African American in the world to urge positive habits and behavior.\n\nIn the most recent volley of exchanges, Chait takes Coates to task for ascribing views to him he does not hold. The column is titled: Ta-Nehisi Coates Disagrees With 'Jonathan Chait,' and So Do I . Chait states clearly he does not equate black culture with a \"culture of poverty\" as do Bill O'Reilly and many on the right, but he does see a link between persistent poverty and culture.\n\nSo let me explain what I do think. The culture of poverty is not solely or even primarily a black problem. It is a problem arising from concentrated poverty, and - as a result of both historic and ongoing racism - concentrated poverty disproportionately afflicts African-American communities. Obama understands that he commands prestige that can make him an inspirational figure in say, poor black neighborhoods in Chicago that he lacks in, say, poor white towns in West Virginia. As I've said, I understand Coates' practical objections to this tactic.\n\nThe reaction I've seen online to this debate suggests a lot of readers on both sides investing a great deal of broader meanings into it - identity, authenticity, yet another endless iteration of the meta question of How We Talk About Race. I have no interest in playing a role in that drama. What interests me is a real and vital public-policy debate over the relationship between culture and poverty.\n\nIn Chait's view, understanding the relationship between culture and poverty is essential to developing effective anti-poverty programs. He seems to view Coates' negation of this relationship as an example of aggressive misreading of his intentions and that of other white liberals rooted in racial hostility. Ultimately, he complains Coates negates the steady progress of U.S. race relations and the steady improvement in conditions and circumstances for the majority of African Americans.\n\nCoates and I disagree about racial progress in America. Coates sees the Americas' racial history as a story of continuity of white supremacy. I see the sequence (I'd call it a progression, but that term would load the argument in my favor) that began with chattel slavery and has led to the Obama administration as a story of halting, painful, non-continuous, but clear improvement. Coates associates himself with a quote from Malcolm X: \"You don't stick a knife in a man's back nine inches, and then pull it out six inches and say you're making progress.\"\n\nThe analogy defines out of existence the very possibility of steady progress. People who subscribe to this way of thinking won't agree with measures that reduce but fail to eliminate racial discrimination, or those that reduce but fail to eliminate poverty, or reduce but fail to eliminate medical deprivation.\n\nJonathan Chait is right about one thing-this is an ongoing and somewhat circular debate of limited utility, at least within the present frame. There are valid arguments to be made that persistent poverty leads to persistent deficits that impact health, well-being and lifestyle in ways that can continue across generations, yet the percentage of poor people who generally fall into this category is fairly small.\n\nThe majority of those classified as poor in the U.S. are people who work but don't make enough money to support themselves or their children, or they are people who have worked in the past but now find themselves permanently excluded from the workforce. The oft-cited statistic of female-headed households living in poverty-31%-is as much a result of the economic disadvantage women still face in the workforce and lack of affordable childcare as it is a reflection of their poor life choices. The \"culture of poverty\" can't be used to explain why 25% of Hispanics are living in poverty, despite exhibiting the work ethic and family cohesion associated by whites with \"middle-class\" success. And yet conservatives and liberals alike continue to focus on the subset of people who are the \"persistently poor\" as representative of the whole.\n\nSo who are these people? Contrary to Paul Ryan's admittedly inarticulate assertion, the locus of persistent poverty is not in our \"inner cities.\" The large majority-85.3%-of persistent-poverty counties are nonmetropolitan. Persistent poverty also demonstrates a strong regional pattern, with nearly 84% of persistent-poverty counties in the South comprising more than one-fifth of all counties in the region. Whether black, white or indigenous, the majority of poor Americans live in rural communities away from large cities. Most live in the southern region, in states whose leaders are committed to cutting assistance for the poor, keeping wages low, denying access to healthcare and empowering corporate extraction of natural resources. These facts are not new; they are consistent with trends that have endured for well over a century.\n\nI agree with Ta-Nehisi Coates. Conservatives and liberals alike prefer to focus on perceived deficits in black and brown people than on structural racism and the concepts of white supremacy that undergird it as the principal reasons for disparate conditions and outcomes for many blacks and Hispanics. White privilege means not having to think about the many ways the lives of those who are classified as white are enhanced and protected by the subjugation and exclusion of racial minorities. White privilege provides white ethnics escape from the stigma of poverty. As historian Nell Irvin Painter aptly distinguishes, \"Not all black people are poor, but among the people in America defined by race, black people tend to be the poorest.\"\n\nSimilarly, the link between poverty and criminality is dubious at best. The vast majority of poor people do not engage in criminal activity despite our tendency to label more and more things crimes. Lack of opportunity breeds disillusionment, which leads to disorder, a conclusion reached more than four decades ago by the Kerner Commission charged with investigating the causes of urban rebellions in the summer of 1967:\n\nAlthough Negro men worked as hard as the immigrants, they were unable to support their families. The entrepreneurial opportunities had vanished. As a result of slavery and long periods of unemployment, the Negro family structure had become matriarchal; the males played a secondary and marginal family role-one which offered little compensation for their hard and unrewarding labor. Above all, segregation denied Negroes access to good jobs and the opportunity to leave the ghetto. For them, the future seemed to lead only to a dead end.\n\nToday, whites tend to exaggerate how well and quickly they escaped from poverty. The fact is that immigrants who came from rural backgrounds, as many Negroes do, are only now, after three generations, finally beginning to move into the middle class.\n\nBy contrast, Negroes began concentrating in the city less than two generations ago, and under much less favorable conditions. Although some Negroes have escaped poverty, few have been able to escape the urban ghetto. Pervasive unemployment and underemployment are the most persistent and serious grievances in minority areas. They are inextricably linked to the problem of civil disorder.\n\nWhat white Americans have never fully understood but what the Negro can never forget-is that white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto. White institutions created it, white institutions maintain it, and white society condones it.\n\nTherein lies the essential dilemma beneath this debate. What should be the focus of attention and reform efforts: changing the behavior of people trapped in cycles of poverty and marginalization, or changing the economic, social and political institutions that sustain the racial and economic status quo? The bootstrap approach advocated by President Obama and majority of the elite community seems to accept the intractable nature of white privilege and keeps the burden on poor communities of color to continuing absorbing the harms of institutional racism while white Americans continue the slow work of transforming their racial attitudes.\n\nWhat Chait's liberal analysis of American racism fails to acknowledge is racism was created to achieve an economic purpose. Anglo-Americans didn't start out as racists, they became racists in order to justify their chosen economic system, which relied on the exploitation of enslaved black labor. The principal motive for racism was and still is, profit.\n\nOne of the many things that infuriates black people, at least it does me, is the obliviousness of white Americans to the ways they project onto black people the pathological and violent behavior they have engaged in and seem to have collectively whitewashed from their memories. In the almost 400 years that African people have been in this country we've been subjected to continuous murder, rape, brutality, dehumanization and mob terror at the hands of whites (lynching ended a century ago only to be replaced by extra-judicial police killings) and yet the contemporary narrative is that whites are justified in their fear of blacks, especially black men. Seriously? Modern policing is based on this premise-one that whites rarely question and have trouble understanding as a source of black rage.\n\nOn the subject of pathology, there is a huge disparity between what white America did and what it remembers it did. Here's a quick refresher that we can't forget and you must remember:\n\nI don't know any instances in American history where thousands of black people gathered to watch the ritualistic killing of a white person as spectator sport.\n\nLest you say, those are isolated events from the past and the majority of white people are not like that anymore, I call your attention to a recent report demonstrating a substantial gap in support for the death penalty, with whites much more in favor than blacks or Hispanics. According to a recent Pew Research poll overall support for the death penalty is 55%. Among whites, however, support for the death penalty jumps to 63%, compared to 40% for Hispanics and 36% for blacks. Slate's Jamelle Bouie argues persuasively that white support for the death penalty is rooted in its history as a tool for whites to control and protect themselves from blacks. He connects the past to the present with the results of another recent study:\n\nIn 2007, two researchers tried to gauge racial differences on capital punishment and assess how blacks and whites responded to arguments against the practice. Their core findings with black Americans weren't a surprise-in general, blacks were receptive to any argument against the death penalty.\n\nTheir findings with whites, on the other hand, were disturbing. Not only were whites immune to persuasion on the death penalty, but when researchers told them of the racial disparity-that blacks faced unfair treatment-many increased their support.\n\nWhite privilege permits people to ignore the reflection of their own pathologies in others."

      "text": "How to Explain Cultural Appropriation to Anyone Who Just Doesn't Get It\n\nIn sections of the media concerned with representation and social justice, it seems we can barely endure a week without a newsworthy incident about \"cultural appropriation.\" While examples of cultural appropriation can be found in just about any cultural facet or artifact, the true complexity of cultural appropriation is often not fully appreciated or sufficiently articulated.\n\nCultural appropriation involves the use of one culture's elements by a group or individual who does not belong to that culture. However, this definition is lacking because such an interaction may be labeled simply as cultural exchange. And that argument would be difficult to defeat because first, who \"owns\" a culture? And second, borrowing from one culture and lending to another has been the way of the world since human society began, according to recorded history and anthropologists.\n\nSo what makes cultural exchange different from cultural appropriation? As with most points of cultural contention, the difference is power. In particular, the power of the privileged to borrow and normalize a cultural element of another group, while the appropriated group is often demonized and excluded because of that very cultural element.\n\nA recent example of cultural appropriation is when non-black people wear black hairstyles (that is, hairstyles associated with global black culture). From cornrows and Senegalese twists to Bantu knots and dreadlocks, which are all rooted in the African diaspora and many of which have been a part of African cultures' heritage for centuries, black hairstyles in the current culture have been deemed \"fashionable\" by white or white-passing celebrities, from the Kardashians to the recent Fashion Week brouhaha in which Marc Jacobs used mainly white models styled in dreadlocks for a show, and only apologized after significant backlash .\n\nCommon retorts to accusations of cultural appropriation include the argument that any hairstyle can be worn by anyone. In the case of Marc Jacobs, another defense of cultural appropriation put forth is that black women also copy Eurocentric hairdos. The latter argument is ahistorical and archaic given that black women globally are subjected to European standards of beauty, and assimilation has been the mode of surviving and thriving in white-dominated spaces. The former argument, on its face, appears harmless. But in truth, it ignores the racial dynamics at work where black women are not only discredited or overlooked for wearing black/African hairdos, they are sometimes even deemed unprofessional and \"ugly,\" from the workplace to the social culture, whereas these hairstyles become \"normalized\" and even fashionable when white spaces and white people \"borrow\" them. This is power. This is cultural appropriation.\n\nAnother recent incident of what happens when power and privilege are ignored in borrowing cultural elements occurred earlier this month when the food magazine Bon AppÃ©tit posted a video titled, \"Pho Is the New Ramen,\" with a suggestion, \"This is how you should be eating pho,\" from a white chef who developed his own pho rendition.\n\nAgain, it was perfectly fine for the chef to do so, but to convolute popular Asian dishes by suggesting one has become the new other inadvertently presents Asian food (and consequently, culture) as a monolith. Moreover, to condescendingly suggest that pho, which hails from Vietnam, has not been eaten the right way until it has been assimilated into a hip, Western food by those with the power and privilege to do so is exactly the sort of interaction that turns cultural exchange into cultural appropriation. Many Asian Americans and particularly those of Vietnamese descent were livid, and Bon AppÃ©tit eventually removed the video and issued an apology .\n\nAs a Nigerian, I could easily empathize. A few years ago when the popular English chef Jamie Oliver came out with his own recipe for Jollof rice, a West African dish that West Africans themselves debate who makes it the best, many all over the diaspora took to the internet to reject it and let him know, thanks, but no thanks. If Jollof is to be the international sensation it ought to be, it will not be Jamie Oliver who makes it so. (Also, as a Nigerian, I never miss an opportunity to state a truth: Nigerian Jollof is the best. End of story.)\n\nFor those speaking from positions of power, the idea of cultural appropriation may be seen as an affront against their historical liberty to participate in cultures freely-a liberty that has often resulted in everything from cultural annihilation and loss to colonization. That history occurred the way it did has set us up for a cultural moment in which exchange between cultures cannot be viewed as simply occurring in a vacuum, devoid of politics, power, and group advantages and disadvantages. This fact is certainly lost on novelist Lionel Shriver, who recently gave one of the most culturally tone-deaf speeches at the Brisbane Festival.\n\nShriver's words were nothing short of uneducated, lacking in empathy, and an intentional misappropriation of the concept. In her address, Shriver commented, \"I hope that the concept of cultural appropriation is a passing fad,\" and went on to wear a sombrero, while staking out her claim to do so, and discussing how fiction writers are entitled to imagine the lives of others. Her arguments suggest that awareness and cognizance of cultural appropriation would mean that fiction writers lose this right. A striking example she used is Little Bee , a novel about a 14-year-old Nigerian girl by Chris Cleave, a white male British author.\n\nThere are historical problems with people from the West imagining and reimagining the \"other.\" When westerners write about others, they are often unable to do so without immense prejudice, and without an appreciation of the diverse stories these people have to tell. To ignore all the ways in which Cleave has the privilege to write about the fictional lives of Nigerian girls when many Nigerian authors may not be able to do so is to ignore several realities: the publishing world's diversity problem , Cleave's juxtaposition to a culture in which he has little to no relationship, and the relationship between Britain and Nigeria, which is forever tainted with the brush of colonialism.\n\nShriver, like so many others, misses the point of cultural appropriation. A sombrero is a cultural artifact of a culture she does not belong to, and without understanding it carefully and approaching it cautiously, she can misuse this artifact to archaically represent or misrepresent a culture. (It's often done; see any American city on Cinco de Mayo.) But what Shriver and others miss is not only the power they hold in their interactions of cultural exchange; it is that many Mexicans have been demonized for these artifacts, and an entire nation of people is symbolized only by that artifact because of the power of those from privileged cultures to exchange in such a manner.\n\nFor those who care about culture-experiencing it, commenting on it, writing about it-cultural appropriation is no passing fad. It is the concept that gives a label to the experience of being from a culture that has been disabused of its power by other cultures who now seek to borrow from it, at no cost, and with no reverence for history. If it's cultural exchange you want, it's up to you to make every effort to learn as much as possible about a people's history and its artifacts. If you participate fully and graciously in another culture, to call it cultural exchange means you are aware of your distance from and relationship to it. And if you choose to borrow, hopefully you do so in such a way as to revere the culture and its people, and amplify the beauty of that culture, with an honest understanding too of their shortcomings, but most importantly, ensuring that members of that culture are seen, heard and appreciated. That's the difference between cultural appropriation-\"borrowing,\" or even stealing, from another culture-and cultural exchange, a more reciprocal and fair transaction."

      "text": "Not All Black Intellectuals Think Alike\n\nThe following article first appeared in The Nation magazine. For more great content from the Nation, sign up for their email newsletters here.\n\nRalph Ellison's Invisible Man opens with a battle royal. The  novel's nameless black male protagonist is asked to recite his high  school  commencement speech touting submission and racial humility for  the white citizens of his segregated town. When he arrives at the venue,  he finds that the white men have arranged for him and other young black  men to don boxing gloves and blindfolds and viciously fight one another  for the entertainment of the white hosts. They even require the boys to  scramble on an electrified mat for gold coins-which later turn out to  be brass. Bruised and bloodied, the narrator is then required to deliver  his speech to the men, who mockingly ignore his elocution. At the end  of the night the same men award him a scholarship to the state college  for Negroes.\n\nThis scene has been playing in a mental loop for me since I  participated in the mini-tempest that exploded in the academic teapot in  the aftermath of Chris Hedges's Truthdig interview with  Professor Cornel West, who stingingly criticized President Obama's  economic and social policies and painted the president as cowardly and  out of touch with black culture. In my response to West on my blog at  TheNation.com, I observed how West's sense of betrayal is clearly more  personal than ideological and as such \"gave insight into the delicate  ego of the self-appointed black leadership that has been largely  supplanted in recent years.\" All of this prompted more discussion,  criticism and attacks-from those organized in defense of West and from  those supportive of the president.\n\nThe debate about President Obama is not uncomfortable. If anything,  arguments about the qualities of Obama's leadership, his commitment to  issues with a disproportionate impact on black people and the psychic  and social effect of his presidency on black communities constitute a  robust, potentially fruitful, sometimes personal, always interesting  discussion that has been going on among African-American academics for  years. We've written critical articles, gathered conflicting data,  argued unflaggingly on e-mail and rolled our eyes at one another at  conferences. Sometimes we've even changed our opinions, moderated our  viewpoints and thanked one another for new information. But, as is often  the case with the work of academics, no one really noticed.\n\nUntil last week-that's when the sudden attention of major media  outlets exposed this ongoing debate to a penetrating white gaze that  still finds the idea of black political disagreement a noteworthy and  entertaining curiosity. In the middle of the ensuing furor, it felt like  I had joined Ellison's narrator on the electrified mat, scrambling for  fake gold coins.\n\nI felt it when MSNBC's Ed Schultz invited Professor West and me to  appear on his show and then asked if West's critique and my response  were evidence of \"trouble\" in black communities. I sensed it when I read  Hedges's rebuttal screed about \"liberal sellouts.\" I detected it in the  tone of many white reporters, radio hosts and bloggers who seemed more  than a little gleeful to watch as the black professors bloodied  themselves and the black president in what must appear to be a  blindfolded, boxing-gloved free-for-all.\n\nI vigorously object to the oft-repeated sentiment that  African-Americans should avoid public disagreements and settle matters  internally to present a united front. It's clear from the history of  black organizing that this strategy is particularly disempowering for  black women, black youth, black gay men and lesbians, and others who  have fewer internal community resources to ensure that their concerns  are represented in a broader racial agenda. Failing to air the dirty  laundry has historically meant that these groups are left washing it  with their own hands.\n\nCitizenship in a democratic system rests on the ability to freely and  openly choose, criticize and depose one's leaders. This must obtain  whether those leaders are elected or self-appointed. It cannot be  contingent on whether the critiques are accurate or false, empirical or  ideological, well or poorly made. Citizenship is voice. West exercised  his voice, and I mine. But the history and persistence of racial  inequality and white privilege in America means that the exercise of  voice for black citizens is fraught with the dangers of surveillance.  It's yet another challenge of being black and exercising citizenship in  the United States. Even as we articulate our grievances, black citizens  are haunted by that \"peculiar sensation\" that W.E.B. Du Bois described  as \"always looking at one's self through the eyes of others, of  measuring one's soul by the tape of a world that looks on in amused  contempt and pity.\"\n\nWhatever the accuracy or erroneousness of West's remarks, there was  little new in them. Arguments about the corporate control of American  politics, the ascendance of Wall Street over Main Street and the  imperial impulse of American foreign policy have been the standard  talking points of the left for more than a decade. What fascinated the  press were the salacious tidbits offered by West that suggested  black-on-black infighting. My response and those that followed added to  the impression that black intellectuals were engaged in a battle royal.  As in Ellison's opening scene, it is the fight, not the speech, that is  the main attraction. That African-Americans strenuously disagree among  ourselves about goals and strategies is an ancient historical truth that  is masked by our nominal partisan similarities. But the intense media  attention over West's critique of President Obama can be understood only  by the repeated refusal by mainstream media and broader American  political culture to adequately grasp the heterogeneity of black  thought."

      "text": "Debunking the Big Lie Right-Wingers Use to Justify Black Poverty and Unemployment\n\nIn April, the Oklahoma legislature passed a constitutional amendment that would do away with affirmative action policies in the Sooner State. Sally Kern, a state rep vying for the coveted title of Most Extreme Lawmaker in America, explained her rationale for supporting the amendment, saying (among a slew of nutty things) that \"it's character that ought to count, not whether you're white or black... it should be your willingness to say, 'I'm going to become everything I can become.'\"\n\nKern suggested that blacks simply don't work as hard as whites. \"I've taught school,\" she said, \"and I saw a lot of people of color who didn't study hard because they said the government would take care of them.\"\n\nKern was simply advancing one of the most enduring and pernicious untruths in America's political economy. It holds that poverty - in general, but especially within communities of color - doesn't result from purely economic factors. Rather, the poor are where they find themselves as a consequence of some deep-seated cultural flaws that keep them from achieving success. They're held back, the story goes, by what is known alternatively as a \"culture of poverty,\" or a \"culture of dependence.\" It's a popular fable for the right, as it absolves the political establishment for public policies that harm the working class and the poor.\n\nIt's also thoroughly and demonstrably untrue, flying in the face of decades of serious research findings.\n\nIt's a myth that should be put to rest by the economic experience of the African American community over the past 20 years. Because what Kern and other adherents of the \"culture of poverty\" thesis can't explain is why blacks' economic fortunes advanced so dramatically during the 1990s, retreated again during the Bush years and then were completely devastated in the financial crash of 2008.\n\nIn order to buy the cultural story, one would have to believe that African Americans adopted a \"culture of success\" during the Clinton years, mysteriously abandoned it for a \"culture of failure\" under Bush and finally settled on a \"culture of poverty\" shortly after Lehman Brothers crashed.\n\nThat's obviously nonsense. It was exogenous economic factors and changes in public policies, not manifestations of \"black culture,\" that resulted in those widely varied outcomes.\n\nThe Clinton Boom, the Bush Bust and the Great Black Depression\n\nDuring the Clinton years, African Americans saw the greatest economic advances in memory. Over the course of the 1990s, millions of black families joined the middle class. With a booming economy and Clintonian policies like the Earned Income Tax Credit, which pulled millions of low-income families out of desperation, the poverty rate among African Americans hit its lowest point in U.S. history in 2000. Black poverty fell by more than 10 percentage points between 1993 and 2000, and poverty among African American children dropped by an unprecedented 10.7 percentage points in five years (from 41.9 percent in 1995 to 31.2 percent in 2000).\n\nBut a little-known fact is that even before the recession hit in 2008, blacks had already taken a huge step back economically during the 2000s. By 2007, African Americans had already lost all of those gains from the 1990s. That year, sociologist Algernon Austin wrote, \"On all major economic indicators-income, wages, employment, and poverty-African Americans were worse off in 2007 than they were in 2000.\"\n\nAlthough the Great Recession obviously hit everyone hard, it didn't cause everyone equal pain. In 2007, the difference between white and black unemployment rates fell to the lowest point in years: just 3 percentage points. Yet as the economy fell into recession, that gap quickly grew again, and by April 2009 it had doubled, reaching a 13-year high. As the economy began to turn around in 2009, African Americans didn't see much recovery; median household income rose 7 percent for white families and only 1 percent for blacks.\n\nToday, with the national unemployment rate at around 9 percent, black joblessness stands at over 16 percent. This week, the New York Times reported that in 2009, the \"median wealth of whites [was] 20 times that of black households,\" a difference that represents \"the largest [racial] wealth disparities in the 25 years that the [Census] bureau has been collecting the data.\"\n\nAgain, while economic swings this significant can be explained by economic changes and different public policies, it's simply impossible to fit them into a cultural narrative.\n\nThe Culture of Poverty: Nonsense Since the Beginning\n\nIn my book, The Fifteen Biggest Lies About the Economy , I look at the origins of the \"culture of poverty,\" as well as the large body of data refuting its existence. The term was first coined in sociologist Oscar Lewis's 1961 book, The Children of Sanchez. Lewis, who had studied poverty in small Mexican communities, asserted that they shared a set of common cultural attributes. Although he had only studied small samples, he concluded that the same attributes were universal among poor people.\n\nEducation scholar Paul Gorski noted that after the publication of Oscar Lewis' book, \"Researchers around the world tested the culture of poverty concept empirically.\" Fifty years of studies have revealed a number of observations about the causes of poverty, but, as Gorski noted, \"On this they all agree: There is no such thing as a culture of poverty. Differences in values and behaviors among poor people are just as great as those between\" the rich and poor. \"The culture of poverty concept,\" he added, \"is constructed from a collection of smaller stereotypes which, however false, seem to have crept into mainstream thinking as unquestioned fact.\"\n\nGorski did an exhaustive literature review on the culture of poverty meme. Are poor people lazier than their wealthier counterparts? Do they have a poor work ethic that keeps them from pulling themselves up by their bootstraps? Quite the opposite is true. A 2002 study by the Economic Policy Institute found that among working adults, poorer people actually put in more hours than wealthier ones did. As Gorski noted, \"The severe shortage of living-wage jobs means that many poor adults must work two, three, or four jobs.\"\n\nThere are quite a bit of data suggesting that kids whose parents are heavily involved in their schooling do better than those whose parents aren't. But are poor people less interested in participating in their kids' schooling, as the culture of poverty myth suggests? No. Several studies have found that rich and poor parents have the same attitudes about education. Poor parents do in fact spend less time going to school events and volunteering in their children's classrooms, but that's not a matter of culture. As Gorski wrote, it's because \"they are more likely to work multiple jobs, to work evenings, to have jobs without paid leave, and to be unable to afford child care and public transportation.\"\n\nAre poor people more likely to use drugs and alcohol? Gorski noted that the research shows that drug use in the United States \"is equally distributed across poor, middle class, and wealthy communities,\" but that \"alcohol abuse is far more prevalent among wealthy people than among poor people.\"\n\nPerhaps the most pervasive narrative is that poor people, and black people especially, don't cherish traditional institutions like marriage. It's self-evident that having one breadwinner instead of two (or one breadwinner and one parent to raise the kids) is an economic disadvantage, and any number of studies have found that single-parent households (especially single-mother families) are more likely to be poor. But the culture of poverty narrative confuses correlation with causation.\n\nJust as people with little money hold the same attitudes about education as those with big bucks do, Jean Hardisty, the author of Marriage as a Cure for Poverty: A Bogus Formula for Women, cites a number of studies showing that \"a large percentage of single low-income mothers would like to be married at some time. They seek marriages that are financially stable, with a loving, supportive husband.\" Poor women have the same dreams as everyone else: they \"often aspire to a romantic notion of marriage and family that features a white picket fence in the suburbs.\" Low economic status leads to fewer marriages, not the other way around.\n\nIn 1998, the Fragile Families Study looked at 3,700 low-income unmarried couples in 20 U.S. cities. The authors found that nine in 10 of the couples living together wanted to tie the knot, but only 15 percent had actually done so by the end of the one-year study period.\n\nAnd here's a key finding: for every dollar that a man's hourly wages increased, the odds that he'd get hitched by the end of the year rose by 5 percent. Men earning more than $25,000 during the year had twice the marriage rates of those making less than $25,000.\n\nWriting up the findings for the Nation , Sharon Lerner noted that poverty \"also seems to make people feel less entitled to marry.\" As one father in the survey put it, marriage means \"not living from check to check.\" Thus, since he was still scraping bottom, he wasn't ready for it. \"There's an identity associated with marriage that they don't feel they can achieve,\" [Princeton sociology professor Sara] McLanahan, one of the study's authors, says of her interviewees. (Ironically, romantic ideas about weddings-the limos, cakes and gowns of bridal magazines-seem to stand in the way of marriage in this context - many couples in the study said they were holding off until they could afford a lavish wedding bash.)\n\nThe Great Black Depression\n\nEarlier this week, I wrote about the crushing economic depression now afflicting the African American community . Those who buy into the culture of poverty mythology would no doubt explain that reality away as a manifestation of blacks' supposedly flawed work ethic. When jobs are hard to come by, only the most persistent people - those willing to acquire new skills or knock on door after door and face rejection after rejection - are going to wind up being employed.\n\nSo let's look again at the evidence. AARP did a study of working people over 45 years of age ( PDF ), and found that \"African Americans surveyed were more likely than the general population to be proactive about jobs and career training.\"\n\nThey took steps such as training to keep skills up-to-date (30% versus 25%), attending a job fair (18% versus 7%), and looked for a new job (24% versus 17%) in the past year at rates higher than the general sample. A sizeable share also indicated that they plan to engage in these behaviors. More African Americans relative to the general population plan to take training (38% versus 33%), look for a new job (27% versus 24%), attend a job fair (26% versus 11%), use the internet for job-related activities (30% versus 23%), and start their own business (13% versus 7%).\n\nThe unemployment rate for African Americans between 45-64 years of age stands at 10.8 percent; the rate for whites of the same age is just 6.4 percent. Older black workers have the drive, and report putting in more effort to land jobs or start businesses than their white counterparts - they embrace a \"culture of success\" -- yet their unemployment rate remains 40 percent higher.\n\nThat's because the \"culture\" provides a very poor explanation for economic outcomes - especially compared with real-world, social and economic factors like the fact that predominantly black schools get 18 percent less funding per student than white schools, black families have just one-twentieth of the accumulated wealth to pay for college or start a new business than whites making the same income and the impact of a large chunk of the black population getting caught up in a racist drug war and carrying a prison record as a result. And, yes, it's still also in part a result of good, old-fashioned racial discrimination ."

      "text": "Mimicry Is Not Solidarity: Rachel Dolezal and the Creation of Antiracist White Identity\n\nIn a country where being black increases your likelihood of being unemployed, poor, rejected for a bank loan, suspected of wrongdoing and profiled as a criminal, being arrested or even shot by police, the mind boggles at Rachel Dolezal's decision some years ago to begin posing as an African American. Yes perhaps blackness helps when you're looking for a job in an Africana Studies department, selling your own African American portraiture art, or hoping to head up the local NAACP branch-all of which appear to have been the case for Dolezal-but generally speaking, adopting blackness as a personal identity and a substitute for one's actual whiteness is not exactly the path of least resistance in America.\n\nCognizant of the rarity with which white folks have tried to pass as black over the years, many have chimed in suggesting the personal, familial and even psychological issues that may lie at the heart of her deceptions. It strikes me that there is an important, largely overlooked and quite likely explanation for Dolezal's duplicity, and one that has real implications for white people seeking to work in solidarity with people of color, whether in the BlackLivesMatter movement, Moral Mondays in North Carolina, or any other component of the modern civil rights and antiracism struggle. It is one I hadn't really thought much about until I read something yesterday, a comment from one of her adopted black brothers, to the effect that while Dolezal was a graduate student at Howard, she felt as though she \"hadn't been treated very well,\" at least in part because she was never fully accepted. She was the white girl from Montana who painted black life onto canvas at a venerable and unapologetically black institution.\n\nNow, on the one hand, good for her I suppose in not interpreting her lack of full acceptance by the folks at Howard as some kind of \"reverse racism.\" At least she didn't take it there, which is probably where some would have ended up. Yet it appears she may have taken it somewhere just as problematic, if less obviously so, and however much better intended the detour.\n\nAllyship involves, at its best, working with people of color, rather than trying to speak for them. I suspect Dolezal discovered at Howard that it isn't enough to love black culture and profess one's solidarity with the movement for black equality; that indeed, black people don't automatically trust white people just because we say we're down; that proving oneself takes time, and that the process is messy as hell, and filled with wrong turns and mistakes and betrayals and apologies and a healthy dose of pain. I suspect she didn't have the patience for the messiness, but armed with righteous indignation at the society around her, and perhaps the one in which she had been raised out west, she opted to cut out the middle man. To hell with white allyship (or as my friends and colleagues Lisa Albrecht and Jesse Villalobos are calling it, \"followership\"), to hell with working with others; rather, she opted to simply become black, to speak for and as those others. Perhaps it was her way of obtaining the authenticity to which she felt entitled because of her sensibilities, and which she felt had been denied her by those whose approval she sought.\n\nIt is a more extreme version, to be sure, but of a piece with those white folks who think dabbling in eastern religion makes them more spiritual, that donning beads and dreamcatchers in their rear-view mirrors makes them indigenous, or that blaring the loudest, brashest hip-hop beats in their stale suburbs renders them hard and street and real, in some way that isn't possible within the confines of white normativity.\n\nI am quite sure that in her mind, her intentions were good; that rejecting whiteness, not merely in the political sense but even in herself was a righteous, perhaps even revolutionary act. But it was neither. It is revolutionary for real black people to rise up against whiteness because they possess a deep and abiding sense of the risk involved in doing so, not from having read about it, but because it is etched in their DNA, in the cell memory passed to them by their ancestors. For black people to challenge whiteness and the horrific consequences of white supremacy is to demand my people shall live, even if I must die.\n\n\\For white people, the revolutionary act is not blacking up and pretending to share that historical memory; rather, it is demanding that despite one's whiteness, one places humanity above skin and the conceits of race, to say that my people will live even as white supremacy must die. It is to remain white and yet challenge what that means in society by striving to change that society every day. Conversely, a white person who has lived as an African American since only slightly before the advent of the Obama administration is effectively seven years old in black years, and even then less weathered by what that means than any actual black seven-year old in this country. A mimic perhaps, possibly even a good one, but a mimic nonetheless. And mimicry is not solidarity.\n\nMost disturbing of all, there was another path, however much Dolezal showed no interest in treading it. Whether intended or not, by negating the history (and even the apparent possibility) of real white antiracist solidarity, Dolezal ultimately provided a slap in the face to that history by saying it wasn't good enough for her to join. That the tradition of John Brown, of John Fee, of the Grimke sisters, of Anne and Carl Braden and Bob and Dottie Zellner, to name a few, wasn't a meaningful enough heritage for her to claim. She wasn't willing to pay her dues, to follow the lead of people of color. She didn't want to do the hard and messy work, struggling with other white people and challenging them, which is what SNCC told us white folks to do in 1967, and what Malcolm had already said shortly before his death. She wanted to be done with white people altogether, to immerse herself in blackness, yet, as a white person, she knew she could never do that fully. And so, instead, this.\n\nThere is a lesson here, for those of us who are white and care deeply about racial equity, justice and liberation: authentic antiracist white identity is what we must cultivate. We cannot shed our skin, nor our privileges like an outdated overcoat. They are not accessories to be donned or not as one pleases, but rather, persistent reminders of the society that is not yet real, which is why we must work with people of color to overturn the system that bestows those privileges. But the key word here is with people of color, not as them. We must be willing to do the difficult work of finding a different way to live in this skin.\n\nThat is the crucible of whiteness for us, and it is more than enough for us to bear, and exactly as much as we must. We need not pretend to the burdens of others in order to get busy making our whiteness, though still visible, no longer relevant to our place in the world."

      "text": "More than 60 years later, Langston Hughes' 'Black Nativity' is still a pillar of African American theater\n\nStudents at Jackson State University in Mississippi present their annual production of 'Black Nativity' in 2017. Charles A. Smith/Jackson State University/Historically Black Colleges & Universities via Getty Images\n\nDuring the end of every calendar year, a particular holiday performance pops up in African American communities and cultural centers across the nation. \"Black Nativity\" is a cherished cultural tradition to some and completely unknown to others.\n\nOne wonderful yet confounding thing about this show is that depending on where you see it, you will see significantly different productions - from Intiman Theatre in Seattle to Penumbra Theatre in St. Paul or the National Center of Afro-American Artists in Boston.\n\nThis might seem counterintuitive, but it is exactly what was intended by the author: Langston Hughes.\n\nHughes, a noted although still underappreciated writer , is often associated with the Harlem Renaissance just after World War I, which spurred the growth of jazz. This era - when he penned some of his most famous poems, such as \" The Negro Speaks of Rivers \" - was the first African American arts movement since Emancipation.\n\nBut Hughes is one of a handful of artists whose work spanned both the Harlem Renaissance and the Black Arts Movement of the 1960s and '70s, which partnered with the modern Civil Rights Movement. In 1961, when Hughes created \"Black Nativity,\" the Black Arts Movement was still in its infancy, but its early ethos was in the air.\n\nBack in the 1920s, civil rights leader W.E.B. DuBois developed the Krigwa Players , a group that originated in Harlem but had satellite organizations in Cleveland, Baltimore, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. The objectives of the Krigwa Players, published in the NAACP's Crisis magazine, were that African American communities create art \"for us,\" \"by us,\" \"about us\" and \"near us.\" As Black consciousness grew and evolved in the 1960s , however, Black artists wanted to go beyond that criteria. They wanted to place African American life in all corners of existence, including ideas that were imposed on Black culture and transforming them to empower Black people.\n\nHughes' desire to write \"Black Nativity\" was his attempt to reclaim the story of Jesus' birth for African Americans - to show the son of God, the ultimate salvation, emerging from the Black community. American notions of Jesus were almost always depicted as white, with just a few exceptions . Hughes' play, on the other hand, called for an entirely Black cast, including the mother and father of Jesus.\n\nMoving people from the margins of a story to the center can prompt artists to find more creative forms. What Hughes developed was less like a simple, straightforward narrative and more like jazz, with improvisation at its center.\n\nThe playwright wanted to make a production with elasticity: a ritual with a basic frame, but plenty of flexibility. Hughes started to experiment with this ritual form in his 1938 play \" Don't You Want to Be Free ?\" performed by the Harlem Suitcase Theater. The play used African American history as a frame, calling to unite poor Black and white people to fight the exploitation of the rich.\n\n\"Black Nativity,\" originally titled \"Wasn't That a Mighty Day,\" is rooted in gospel music. The 27 songs in the original text serve as a sonic framing tool. It was to have a large choir - 160 singers strong, in the first production - as well as a narrator, and two dancers to embody Mary and Joseph. The script calls for \"no set (only a platform of various levels,) a star and a place for a manger.\"\n\nHughes was an appreciator of modern dance and enlisted two of the best to hold the roles of Joseph and Mary: Alvin Ailey and Carmen de Lavallade . Yes, that Alvin Ailey, who went on to found one of the country's most famous dance ensembles.\n\nBy all accounts, the dances that Ailey and de Lavallade constructed were brilliant - but were never seen by the public. The pair quit the show last-minute and were replaced by new dancers who could not use their choreography.\n\nMy former professor, the late George Houston Bass , was once Hughes' secretary. Bass told me that Ailey and de Lavallade left in dispute over the title, which Hughes wanted to change to \"Black Nativity.\"\n\nAiley and de Lavallade, however, thought that \"Wasn't That a Might Day\" was more inclusive. The dancers felt the show told the story of Jesus, and there was no need to focus on the emphasis on race - not entirely different from debates today. Should we emphasize that Barack Obama was a Black president, or a president who happened to be Black?\n\nI directed \"Black Nativity\" for Penumbra Theatre for a few years, starting in 2008, partnering with the Twin Cities' TU Dance company .\n\nLou Bellamy, the founder and artistic director of the theater, told me there were audience members who came back every year. It was a tradition for many families originally from the Twin Cities to come from the four corners of the earth to see \"Black Nativity \" and visit their relatives - in that order of importance.\n\nHe went on to tell me that the audiences liked when we tweaked the show, but we had to keep the frame - including many of the gospel classics from the original, such as \"Go Tell It On the Mountain.\"\n\nIn the original text of the play, the narrator told the story of Joseph traveling to Bethlehem with his pregnant wife, because Emperor Caesar Augustus had required that everyone be taxed . It starts with Mary and Joseph looking for a room.\n\nIn my version, the interior narrative centers on an upper-middle-class Black family that is visited by a stranger who helps them find the true meaning of Christmas. Mary and Joseph are a truly extended part of the family who show up with the stranger and need a place for the holidays. They are not left to a manger, but brought into a home - prompting the audience to reexamine how to welcome the Lord into their homes and hearts.\n\nBellamy, the artistic director, also said that I had a responsibility to the theater's bottom line. He pulled out a spreadsheet and showed me the proceeds of the previous year's mounting. I believe Bellamy's quote to me was, \"I don't care if you put the devil in the middle of it. We have to make this number.\"\n\nFinancially, Hughes' ritual play has become fuel for African American cultural institutions to maintain themselves. Penumbra, for example, has been an anchor in the Rondo neighborhood of St. Paul for almost half a century. \"Black Nativity\" is also an anchor for the National Center of Afro-American Artists , which has produced its own version since 1968; Karamu House in Cleveland; the Black Theatre Troupe in Phoenix; and many more.\n\nThe flexibility of this play and the resilience of these institutions is why \"Black Nativity\" is still here - and will stay for a long time. Hughes' vision allows for African American theaters as old as Karamu House, the nation's oldest, or the newest playhouse today to make their own \"Joy to the World.\"\n\nDominic Taylor , Acting Chair of Theater, School of Theater, Film and Television, University of California, Los Angeles\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "text": "Why Do Companies Like Dove Keep Missing the Mark on Culturally Insensitive Ads?\n\nIn early October, when Dove released an ad that was at the very least culturally insensitive , outrage from white people and people of color alike ensued. The ad showed women from a variety of ethnicities changing clothes to represent getting clean with Dove body wash. But the depiction of a black model removing her shirt seemingly equated becoming clean with becoming white. It's unclear what Dove hoped to accomplish with this ad, but the flood of responses led to a public apology and removal of the ad .\n\nThis is not the first time in recent history that Dove, along with other large-scale agencies for beauty products and other commodities, has released ads that insulted or downright ostracized black women or communities of color.\n\nA few months ago, Shea Moisture, which provides products tailored to black skin and hair , released an ad that caused backlash. The advertisement, which featured all-white or very light-skinned, loose-haired black women, alienated the company's target customers. Shea Moisture gained its widespread success by providing affordable products for black women who have coarse and kinky natural hair. It didn't take long for the criticism and product boycotts to trigger an apology from Shea Moisture, but for many, their loyalty to the brand was severed.\n\nEarlier in 2017, Pepsi made a mockery of police and community relations after releasing an ad that made agreement between the opposed views seem as simple as sharing a soda. The oversimplification of the Black Lives Matter movement left many infuriated.\n\nAnd more recently, in late October, Santher, a Brazilian toilet paper company took the racist-ad cake for using the slogan \" Black is Beautiful ,\" a phrase that became popular in the late '60s to early '70s to celebrate black empowerment in the face of European beauty standards. But Santher used the phrase to market the debut of its new black toilet paper. For many, this message literally represented wiping one's backside with black empowerment and beauty.\n\n2017 isn't the first year we have seen these and similar marketing campaigns in the news quarterly, if not more often. Many consumers have abandoned product lines they have used for years due to the mismanaged opportunity to appeal to customers of color.\n\nProduct boycotts and decreases in offending companies' revenue are becoming more common as black Americans seek to let their dollars do the talking. But in the meantime, many stand by wondering what could have possibly provoked well-known companies to produce campaigns that demonstrate so little concern for cultural sensitivity.\n\n\"We currently live in a very racially charged climate, and I am a firm believer that if you don't understand the importance of creating quality content without offending others now, you never will,\" said Stephanie Caudle, founder of Black Girl Group , a micro-job site that connects African-American women freelancers to companies that are struggling to create content for African-American audiences.\n\nIt doesn't take long to figure out the source of the issue. The reason so few companies produce materials with culturally sensitive displays is because companies aren't really very diverse. A look at the higher ranks of marketing at many of the top companies reveals very few black marketing executives. The last few years have shown us that black Americans-women in particular-are a driving force in regard to both purchasing power and trendsetting. But because they are often underrepresented or not represented at all within the upper echelons of these agencies, materials continue to be produced that don't acknowledge these facts.\n\nCaudle, who has worked in marketing and advertising for over 10 years, believes the recent marketing snafus were more insensitive than offensive, and that they reflect shallow attempts at industry diversification-and the data supports her on the latter.\n\nThe AdColor Partnership Guide notes:\n\n\"According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, of the 582,000 Americans employed in advertising and communications in 2014, less than half are women, 6.6% are black or African-American, 5.7% are Asian and 10.5% are Hispanic.\"\n\nThere are fewer than 100 black female executives in advertising , PR and related industries in the U.S.\n\nThe lack of diversity in the industry makes responsible content difficult to achieve, and it can only be remedied by changing the numbers.\n\n\"Given some of the horrible mishaps [as mentioned above], companies are in desperate need of more diversity at their tables, and I am here to bring it. African Americans only make up 5 percent of advertising professionals, and if we don't have more African Americans working for these major companies creating the campaigns seeking to 'appeal' to African American audiences, they are going to continue to get it wrong,\" Caudle continues.\n\nLack of diversity is an issue that comes up on all sides of the industry. Simone Pratt, senior brand strategist at Saatchi & Saatchi Wellness, has been on the agency side of advertising for 20 years. In that time, she has seen many of the perils black women face in marketing. And while she has been on the 'other' side of the table, she's experienced many of the issues black women share in other industries.\n\n\"There is always the conundrum of being one of the only black women at a table, and if you are passionate or push back, you feel you may be viewed as the 'angry black woman,'\" explained Pratt. \"I have been told to 'calm down' when I am passionately expressing my views... A man or man of color would never be told that.\"\n\nCaudle has had similar experiences in how companies perceive her as a black woman. \"As a black woman in marketing, I often feel as if I have to scale back my passion in fear of being deemed aggressive. I have often been in rooms and the moment I become vocal is the moment people tell me that I need to 'scale it back'.\"\n\nThe collective knowledge of black women is often ignored or suppressed in the need to assimilate. When black women are lucky enough to be 'at the table,' they're often discouraged from full engagement. The prejudices and bias that come with being one of few black faces in a crowd have an effect on the delivery of ideas by black women. Pratt says she doesn't talk the same way she did in the past for fear of being labeled. \"Now I am at a general market agency, and often the only black person and black woman in the room. I feel I want to be heard and carefully choose my words so the room hears me and not... through the lens of their unconscious or conscious bias,\" she said.\n\nThe climate of the advertising industry can be emotionally taxing on black women. Pratt says she spends a lot of time having to correct others who use insensitive language. \"I work in an industry where being 'hip' is table stakes. So people push the envelope with language,\" she says. \"I have been in meetings where people say that something unorganized is 'ghetto' or use very colloquial language... and call it 'brand planning dirty.' All these examples I have called people out and create awareness of what is offensive.\"\n\nPratt also brought up a perspective many hadn't previously considered-that many organizations are well aware of the offensiveness of their brand and may intentionally ruffle feathers for wide-scale attention. She refers to agencies that intentionally produce provocative and appropriative material with no desire to understand the culture as \"brand blackface.\" After becoming fed up with companies that take this shallow approach, Pratt began calling brands and agencies out on Twitter for their offenses.\n\n\"There are a lot of agencies that create work for provocation sake or appropriate from our culture. I came up with the term [brand blackface] because similar to blackface in vaudeville, some brands are inauthentic in their borrowing from our culture not for celebratory purposes but for a laugh. Like all the brands who used 'fleek' and it did not match their brand DNA (i.e., iHop ),\" she explained.\n\nOverlooking the cultural significance of terms and images can be hurtful to communities of color. Furthermore, it's particularly essential to acknowledge their influence on children's identity development. Children are affected and influenced by the images they see in the media. Over the last few decades, various studies have shown how advertising can lead to lower self-esteem in kids. Historical research like the famed \" Doll Test \" first conducted by Kenneth and Mamie Clark has shown how children learn to associate lighter-skinned dolls with beauty and positive attributes, and darker dolls with negative concepts. This experiment has been recreated several times in the last few decades and the findings are heartbreakingly similar.\n\nIrresponsible attempts to connect with the black community perpetuate this tradition.\n\n\"When people of color are not celebrated and seen as authentic, fully dimensional beings, we have the doll experiment being done recently and having the same results as in the 1940s,\" Pratt said. \"Commercials are reflective and a microcosm of our culture and lives. They are only 30-60 seconds, but they are a two-way conversation with brands, and they build relationships with us.\"\n\nCaudle shares a similar perspective when emphasizing how perceptions in marketing can influence widescale public perceptions of communities of color. \"At the end of the day, marketing/advertising contributes to some of the systemic racism issues we have in America thanks to programming, and if marketing efforts continue to lack diversity, the perception of communities of color will continue to be either skewed or one-sided.\"\n\nBy 2020, black buying power is projected to reach $1.4 trillion and is well on the path to being the largest racial minority consumer market . Companies that choose not to prioritize the needs of the community will be the ones to come up short. In 2016, Nielsen released a report called \" Increasingly Affluent, Educated and Diverse: African-American Consumers \" that discussed the widescale purchasing power in the black community. The demographic's increased education and finances are among the reasons black Americans have become a must-watch force for companies. If you spend a moment thinking of the most popular hairstyles, verbiage and attire, they typically have some level of origination from black culture. Research has indicated that black youth have an unprecedented capacity for trendsetting and drawing in the attention of other minority youth.\n\nIncreased exploration of the levels of diversity in companies is prompting agencies to do more to recruit women of color-and that's great. But as corporate America does its best to change the demographics, it's important to hire black women for the right reasons. \"Before stepping into new roles, you have to be sure that these companies are really intentional about their recruitment and not just recruiting women of color because it sounds or looks good,\" said Caudle.\n\nBoth hiring and targeted messages have to be authentically tailored for the black community. In a piece by Janie Boschma for the Atlantic, Cheryl Pearson-McNeil , coauthor of the report and Nielsen's senior vice president for strategic community alliances and consumer engagement, had the following to say about the importance of effective customer engagements: \"[T]hose ads have to be culturally relevant and nuanced. Hiring a black model for the sake of diversity isn't going to cut it without also incorporating smart messaging through a broader engagement strategy.\"\n\nThe lack of black Americans-women in particular-involved in the decision-making process will have significant effects on companies' ability to convert sales and understand key markets. But more importantly, misguided efforts to reach the black community pose the risk of negative messaging for developing minds of all races. Through diversification, the marketing industry can gain integrity and make steps toward the future. Black women are more than willing to do the work it takes to make an impact. Now it's up to companies to make the change."

      "text": "Don't Forget The Contributions of  Black History Giant Hubert Harrison\n\nHubert H. Harrison (1883-1927) is one of the truly important figures of 20th-century history. A brilliant writer, orator, educator, critic and political activist, he was described by the historian Joel A. Rogers, in World's Great Men of Color as \"the foremost Afro-American intellect of his time.\" This extraordinary praise came amid chapters on Booker T. Washington, W.E.B. Du Bois, William Monroe Trotter and Marcus Garvey.\n\nRogers adds that, \"No one worked more seriously and indefatigably to enlighten\" others and \"none of the Afro-American leaders of his time had a saner and more effective program.\" Labor and civil rights leader A. Philip Randolph described Harrison as \"the father of Harlem Radicalism.\" Harrison's friend and pallbearer, Arthur Schomburg, fully aware of his popularity, eulogized to the thousands attending Harrison's Harlem funeral that he was also \"ahead of his time.\"\n\nBorn in St. Croix, Danish West Indies, on April 27, 1883, to a Bajan mother and a Crucian father, Harrison arrived in New York as a 17-year-old orphan in 1900. He made his mark in the United States by struggling against class and racial oppression, by helping to create a remarkably rich and vibrant intellectual life among African Americans and by working for the enlightened development of those he affectionately referred to as \"the common people.\"\n\nHe consistently emphasized the need for working-class people to develop class-consciousness; for \"Negroes\" to develop race consciousness, self-reliance and self-respect; and for all those he reached to challenge white supremacy and develop an internationalist spirit and modern, scientific, critical and independent thought as a means toward liberation.\n\nA self-described \"radical internationalist,\" Harrison was well-versed in history and events in Africa, the Caribbean, Asia, the Mideast, the Americas and Europe and he wrote voluminously and lectured indoors and out (as a pioneering soapbox orator) on these topics. More than any other political leader of his era, he combined class-consciousness and anti-white supremacist race consciousness in a coherent political radicalism.\n\nHarrison opposed capitalism and imperialism and maintained that white supremacy was central to capitalist rule in the United States. He emphasized that \"politically, the Negro is the touchstone of the modern democratic idea\"; that \"as long as the Color Line exists, all the perfumed protestations of Democracy on the part of the white race\" were \"downright lying\" and \"the cant of 'Democracy'\" was \"intended as dust in the eyes of white voters\"; that true democracy and equality for \"Negroes\" implied \"a revolution ... startling even to think of,\" and that \"capitalist imperialism which mercilessly exploits the darker races for its own financial purposes is the enemy which we must combine to fight.\"\n\nWorking from this theoretical framework, he was active with a wide variety of movements and organizations and played signal roles in the development of what were, up to that time, the largest class radical movement (socialism) and the largest race radical movement (the \"New Negro\"/Garvey movement) in U.S. history. His ideas on the centrality of the struggle against white supremacy anticipated the profound transformative power of the Civil Rights/Black Liberation struggles of the 1960s and his thoughts on democracy offer penetrating insights on the limitations and potential of America in the 21st century.\n\nHarrison served as the foremost black organizer, agitator and theoretician in the Socialist Party of New York during its 1912 heyday. He founded the first organization (the Liberty League) and the first newspaper (the Voice ) of the militant, World War I-era \"New Negro\" movement; edited The New Negro: A Monthly Magazine of a Different Sort (\"intended as an organ of the international consciousness of the darker races-especially of the Negro race\") in 1919; wrote When Africa Awakes: The \"Inside Story\" of the Stirrings and Strivings of the New Negro in the Western World in 1920; and he served as the editor of the Negro World and principal radical influence on the Garvey movement during its radical high point in 1920.\n\nHis views on race and class profoundly influenced a generation of \"New Negro\" militants including the class radical A. Philip Randolph and the race radical Marcus Garvey. Considered more race conscious than Randolph and more class conscious than Garvey, Harrison is the key link in the ideological unity of the two great trends of the Black Liberation Movement-the labor and civil rights trend associated with Martin Luther King, Jr., and the race and nationalist trend associated with Malcolm X. (Randolph and Garvey were, respectively, the direct links to King marching on Washington, with Randolph at his side, and to Malcolm-whose father was a Garveyite preacher and whose mother wrote for the Negro World-speaking militantly and proudly on street corners in Harlem.)\n\nHarrison, howevever, was not only a political radical. Rogers described him as an \"intellectual giant and freelance educator,\" whose contributions were wide-ranging, innovative and influential. He was an immensely skilled and popular orator and educator who spoke and/or read six languages; a highly praised journalist, critic and book reviewer (who reportedly started \"the first regular book-review section known to Negro newspaperdom\"); a pioneer black activist in the freethought and birth control movements; and a bibliophile and library builder and popularizer who was an officer on the committee that helped develop the 135th Street Public Library into what has become known as the internationally famous Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture.\n\nPeople are encouraged to spread the word about Hubert Harrison and to keep alive the struggles and memory of this giant of black history."

(Photo by Amy Harris/Invision/AP, File)\n\nNEW ORLEANS (AP) - For 30 years, the Essence Festival of Culture has brought together people from all walks of life and from around the world to connect through conversation, shared experiences and, of course, music.\n\nThe nation's largest annual celebration of Black culture ended Sunday with musical performances by Janet Jackson and a special tribute to Frankie Beverly & Maze, the soul band that closed the event for the festival's first 15 years. Beverly, now 77, has said he is stepping away from performing live, and the group has been on a farewell tour.\n\nOthers performing included Victoria Monét , Teedra Moses, Tank and the Bangas, Dawn Richard, SWV, Jagged Edge, Bilal and Anthony Hamilton.\n\nBarkue Tubman-Zawolo, chief of staff, talent and diasporic engagement for Essence Ventures, told The Associated Press the festival helps connect the global Black community.\n\n\"Historically, as Black people, sometimes we're not sure where our heritage comes from,\" Tubman-Zawolo said. \"America is just one place. But within America there's a melting pot of different Black cultures: Africa, Latin, Europe, the Caribbean. Understanding that allows our power to be even greater.\"\n\nTubman-Zawolo said those connections could be seen throughout this year's Film Festival, held at the city's convention center, where fans heard from storytellers from Nigeria, Ghana and the Caribbean \"who are targeting our stories about us, for us, globally. \"\n\nShe noted similar connections through the Food and Wine stage, where discussions highlighted Caribbean and African cuisine; the Soko Market Place, where vendors from all over the world shared their craft; and on the Caesars Superdome stage, which spotlighted Caribbean and African artists including Machel Montano of Trinidad.\n\n\"All of that occurred over four days,\" Tubman-Zawolo said. \"But the beauty of it is, it doesn't stay here. (Fans) take it with them.\"\n\nNew Orleans Mayor Latoya Cantrell said this year's \"We Love Us\" theme was appropriate.\n\n\"This whole 'We Love Us' theme brought us together to build communities,\" she said.\n\nThe festival's impact on the city and state has surpassed $300 million, with more than 500,000 people visiting since 1994.\n\nEssence started the festival as a way to celebrate 25 years of the magazine's history.\n\n\"The locals are being incorporated in a manner that we can see and touch and feel and smell.

Hank Johnson, a Democratic sponsor of federal legislation that would protect artists from having their lyrics and creative expression used against them in court.\n\nThe Georgia congressman spoke in support of the legislation to the thousands who attended a Rolling Loud hip-hop music festival in Miami late last month. Johnson and fellow Democrat Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York sponsored the Restoring Artistic Protection Act, or RAP Act, to ensure that lyrics aren't the only evidence supporting a criminal case. Similar legislation in a handful of states would require prosecutors to prove a defendant's lyrics aren't figurative, exaggeration or out-right fictional.\n\nA study by University of Georgia law professor Andrea Dennis, who co-authored the 2019 book \"Rap on Trial: Race, Lyrics and Guilt in America,\" found roughly 500 criminal trial cases dating to the late 1980s in which rap lyrics were successfully used as evidence. Dennis and other advocates believe the cases, brought against mostly Black defendants, have led to unjust incarceration.\n\nSome have pointed to the criminal street gang conspiracy case, brought under Georgia's criminal racketeering law, against Atlanta rapper Young Thug and over two dozen purported affiliates of the rapper's Young Stoner Life record label. In 2022, Fulton County prosecutors included lyrics from the rapper, referencing drugs and violence, as evidence of an \"overt act in furtherance of a (gang) conspiracy.\"\n\nYoung Thug, whose legal name is Jeffrey Williams, co-wrote the Childish Gambino hit \"This is America,\" which is a commentary on violence and systemic racism in the U.S. The song made history in 2019 as the first hip-hop track to win the song of the year Grammy - and it was parodied by global artists to speak to corruption and injustice in Nigeria, Malaysia and Australia.\n\n__\n\n\"Cops give a damn about a negro/Pull the trigger, kill a n---, he's a hero.\" - Tupac, \"Changes,\" 1992\n\n__\n\nAs hip-hop and rap music grew into a force in American culture, its pioneers used it as a medium to speak to their personal realities. In 1982, in the song \"The Message,\" Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five decried stark poverty and disinvestment that seemed especially concentrated in Black communities. A decade later, Tupac Shakur railed against police brutality in the song \"Changes.\"\n\nIn 2016, following the fatal police shootings of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, rap music and protest were almost inextricably linked. It was rare then to attend a demonstration and not hear Kendrick Lamar's 2015 song \"Alright,\" a celebration of triumph over adversity in the face of systemic oppression and injustice.\n\n\"All Black creative expression is political because Black life is political,\" said Timothy Welbeck, the director of the Center for Anti-Racism at Temple University in Philadelphia.\n\nWelbeck, who is also an independent rap artist and teaches courses on hip-hop in Temple's Africology and African American Studies Department, said rap music's accessibility is what makes the genre so popular and so impactful.\n\n\"It makes sense that social movements would gravitate towards hip-hop, as a culture and rap music as a medium of expression,\" he said. \"And it also makes sense that rappers would position themselves in these movements, in part, because rappers are coming out of the communities that are experiencing the need to protest.\"\n\nIn an Associated Press interview earlier this year, Chuck D of Public Enemy said he sees hip-hop as a catalyst for the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\n\"(BLM is) a collective where people felt the same way,\" he said. \"It spoke politically to the injustice regarding George Floyd and was a spark that connected around the world. Hip-hop has done the same thing. Hip-hop ties human beings for their similarities and knocks the differences to the side. It's a movement.\"\n\nFollowing worldwide protests over Floyd's 2020 murder by police in Minneapolis, his brother Terrence Floyd joined an effort to fuse rap, gospel and spirituals on an album of protest songs . A former church drummer, Floyd said he wanted to use the music to affect change in his brother's name.\n\n__\n\n\"I'm at the preacher's door/My knees gettin' weak and my gun might blow/But we gon' be alright.\" - Kendrick Lamar, \"Alright,\" 2015\n\n__\n\nAnd then there's hip-hop's global influence on protest, resistance and political dissent. From the Arab Spring and the Palestinian freedom fight to feminism and class struggles, rap music is a popular medium for calls to action, as well as call-outs of despots and colonizers.\n\nRap music videos produced by artists in African, Europe, Asia and South America often include beatboxers, breakdancers, graffiti and other elements of hip-hop.\n\nIn 2016, on a visit to Vietnam during a historic tour of Asia, former President Barack Obama answered questions about human rights and free expression across the continent. One question came from Suboi, a female rapper known as Vietnam's \"Queen of Hip-Hop\" who said she struggled against the Vietnamese stereotype that rap music isn't a proper expression for Asian women.\n\n\"Let's be honest, sometimes art is dangerous and that's why governments sometimes get nervous about art,\" Obama said. \"But one of the things that I truly believe is that if you try to suppress the arts, then I think you're suppressing the deepest dreams and aspirations of a people.\"\n\nCivil rights leader Rev. Al Sharpton, who turned 18 as hip-hop really took off out of his native New York, said rap music fueled the movement that has shaped much of his public life. At age 68, he believes hip-hop culture tilled the ground for the election of the first Black American president in 2008.\n\n\"I didn't come out of the 'We Shall Overcome' generation,\" Sharpton said. \"I came out of Fight the Power, Public Enemy.\"\n\nHe added: \"Hip-hop took the chains off us and said, 'No, we're gonna say it our way, anyway.' ... It was that freedom. It was that raw, non-watered down kind of expression. We understood that rage and anger, even though we expressed it in different ways.\"\n\n__\n\nAP writer Jonathan Landrum in Los Angeles contributed.\n\n__ Aaron Morrison is a New York-based member of the AP's Race and Ethnicity team.

(Jae Kim via AP)\n\nBANGKOK (AP) - Chinese American rapper Bohan Phoenix has straddled both countries in his career. Working with Chinese rappers like the popular Higher Brothers, he has always interspersed English song lyrics with a catchy Chinese chorus.\n\nFar from the flex-heavy culture of rap songs in the Top 40, his latest album \"Make You Proud\" is a heartfelt, bilingual exploration of the musician's life. In it, Phoenix hits back at the haters who say his Chinese isn't good, and speaks of his own naivety in the commercialized space that is the music industry, and what he's most known for: the dual strands of his Chinese and American lives.\n\nThe album was a personal challenge, Phoenix said. He's most proud of its eponymous first song, in which he raps about his average grades in China and moving to the U.S. at age 11, over a repeating series of piano chords.\n\n\"When I was posting on Douyin and Chinese social media, people were like ... 'his Chinese sounds weird,'\" he said in an interview with The Associated Press. The comments got to him. \"It just got to a point where I was like, I do feel like it's time to challenge myself as an artist.\"\n\nOnce he decided to take the challenge, the rhymes came naturally. His lyrics are different from Chinese rappers who try to compete in the complexity of their rhymes, often using chengyu, four-character literary proverbs. It's straightforward, though critics say the vocabulary is simple, at the level of a third-grader.\n\nPhoenix said he's happy with the result, \"I had never been able to tell my story so clearly in Chinese before,\" he said.\n\nFor an artist who started rapping in English, Chinese was at first just an ornamentation in his music. But as he got older, Phoenix says he felt more compelled to use Chinese and being more in touch with his mother tongue. When he moved back to China in 2017, he said he \"couldn't soundcheck without someone's help, because I just didn't know how to say certain equipment on stage.\"\n\nHis album also touches on politics, though Phoenix says he has never thought of himself or his work as political. Yet its release comes a year after China lifted strict COVID-19 lockdowns, during which passenger flights were reduced and pandemic border controls kept families separated. Phoenix himself couldn't get a visa to go back and see his family for three years.\n\nHis music touches on the rise of rap in China as well as the pointed questions raised when Black Lives Matter protests burst out nationwide in the U.S. after the May 2020 murder of George Floyd, who was Black, by a white police officer. On his latest album, \"Love for you,\" Phoenix apologizes to Higher Brothers for saying they were not speaking in support of Black Lives Matter.\n\nDuring that period, Phoenix said he saw a lack of \"accountability\" from the Asian rapping community, and \"as Asian rappers who made a boatload of money from Black culture, it was only right that we showed up and donated to the cause.\"\n\nPhoenix had called out 88Rising, a label that features Asian hip-hop artists, as well as Higher Brothers and Vava, some of the biggest names in the Chinese rapping sphere. The label later announced a donation of $60,000 in support of funds against racial inequality.\n\nPhoenix's criticism led to a rift with Higher Brothers that hasn't healed. The group told Bohan he should have reached out privately instead of writing about it online. They also said they didn't understand the situation in the U.S.\n\nBack in the U.S. during the pandemic, Phoenix donated money and marched in the streets. He also served as a moderator for a panel about Asian American support for Black Lives Matter. \"Everything felt really urgent,\" he said of the time.\n\nPolitics and racism again reared its head during a sharp tick in anti-Asian hate crimes in the U.S., and very visible attacks on elderly Asian Americans in major cities like New York and San Francisco.\n\nPhoenix said he immediately thought of his mother, and worried about her getting attacked in New York. He released a song called \"but I still love you\" as part of a campaign #HateIsAVirus, which features people of different ethnicities dancing and singing together. Again, he spoke of Black and Asian solidarity, and of seeing everyone as human first.\n\n\"I know I look nothing like you, but I hope that you still love me,\" the crowd sings in the chorus of the song.\n\nPhoenix is clear on why he does what he does.\n\n\"But my need for music isn't about money or fast cars, when I have nothing, it gives me confidence and joy,\" he raps in \"Love For You.\"\n\nFor now, Phoenix is focused on his work in China, in part because he wants to spend time with his grandfather. He still shuttles between the U.S. and China, and is one of the few artists who perform and attract audiences in both countries. He appears as confident in Harlem as he is in Chengdu.\n\nPhoenix is due to join the next season of a popular hip-hop competition show, Rap of China, which has brought rap to the mainstream, in the spring.\n\nTo him, China represents possibility.\n\n\"For me I'm confident in my music to be in the States, but being in China ... I have always thought, Oh man, what would it be like to be in New York when hip-hop just got started?\" he said. \"To me, China kind of feels like that. It feels like the wild, wild West.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(Photo by Amy Harris/Invision/AP, File)\n\nNEW ORLEANS (AP) - For 30 years, the Essence Festival of Culture has brought together people from all walks of life and from around the world to connect through conversation, shared experiences and, of course, music.\n\nThe nation's largest annual celebration of Black culture ended Sunday with musical performances by Janet Jackson and a special tribute to Frankie Beverly & Maze, the soul band that closed the event for the festival's first 15 years. Beverly, now 77, has said he is stepping away from performing live, and the group has been on a farewell tour.\n\nOthers performing included Victoria Monét , Teedra Moses, Tank and the Bangas, Dawn Richard, SWV, Jagged Edge, Bilal and Anthony Hamilton.\n\nBarkue Tubman-Zawolo, chief of staff, talent and diasporic engagement for Essence Ventures, told The Associated Press the festival helps connect the global Black community.\n\n\"Historically, as Black people, sometimes we're not sure where our heritage comes from,\" Tubman-Zawolo said. \"America is just one place. But within America there's a melting pot of different Black cultures: Africa, Latin, Europe, the Caribbean. Understanding that allows our power to be even greater.\"\n\nTubman-Zawolo said those connections could be seen throughout this year's Film Festival, held at the city's convention center, where fans heard from storytellers from Nigeria, Ghana and the Caribbean \"who are targeting our stories about us, for us, globally. \"\n\nShe noted similar connections through the Food and Wine stage, where discussions highlighted Caribbean and African cuisine; the Soko Market Place, where vendors from all over the world shared their craft; and on the Caesars Superdome stage, which spotlighted Caribbean and African artists including Machel Montano of Trinidad.\n\n\"All of that occurred over four days,\" Tubman-Zawolo said. \"But the beauty of it is, it doesn't stay here. (Fans) take it with them.\"\n\nNew Orleans Mayor Latoya Cantrell said this year's \"We Love Us\" theme was appropriate.\n\n\"This whole 'We Love Us' theme brought us together to build communities,\" she said.\n\nThe festival's impact on the city and state has surpassed $300 million, with more than 500,000 people visiting since 1994.\n\nEssence started the festival as a way to celebrate 25 years of the magazine's history.\n\n\"The locals are being incorporated in a manner that we can see and touch and feel and smell. That has been a part of the evolution of Essence,\" Cantrell said.\n\nThe event's current contract ends in 2026, but Essence Ventures CEO Caroline Wanga has said the festival's \"forever home\" is New Orleans.\n\n\"That's what we believe as well,\" Cantrell said. \"We have a foundation that's been laid over 30 years. The city is always ready and prepared to host this event and more. I think staying in New Orleans is the best fit and best marriage, the best partnership.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(Photo by Amy Harris/Invision/AP, File)\n\nNEW ORLEANS (AP) - For 30 years, the Essence Festival of Culture has brought together people from all walks of life and from around the world to connect through conversation, shared experiences and, of course, music.\n\nThe nation's largest annual celebration of Black culture ended Sunday with musical performances by Janet Jackson and a special tribute to Frankie Beverly & Maze, the soul band that closed the event for the festival's first 15 years. Beverly, now 77, has said he is stepping away from performing live, and the group has been on a farewell tour.\n\nOthers performing included Victoria Monét , Teedra Moses, Tank and the Bangas, Dawn Richard, SWV, Jagged Edge, Bilal and Anthony Hamilton.\n\nBarkue Tubman-Zawolo, chief of staff, talent and diasporic engagement for Essence Ventures, told The Associated Press the festival helps connect the global Black community.\n\n\"Historically, as Black people, sometimes we're not sure where our heritage comes from,\" Tubman-Zawolo said. \"America is just one place. But within America there's a melting pot of different Black cultures: Africa, Latin, Europe, the Caribbean. Understanding that allows our power to be even greater.\"\n\nTubman-Zawolo said those connections could be seen throughout this year's Film Festival, held at the city's convention center, where fans heard from storytellers from Nigeria, Ghana and the Caribbean \"who are targeting our stories about us, for us, globally. \"\n\nShe noted similar connections through the Food and Wine stage, where discussions highlighted Caribbean and African cuisine; the Soko Market Place, where vendors from all over the world shared their craft; and on the Caesars Superdome stage, which spotlighted Caribbean and African artists including Machel Montano of Trinidad.\n\n\"All of that occurred over four days,\" Tubman-Zawolo said. \"But the beauty of it is, it doesn't stay here. (Fans) take it with them.\"\n\nNew Orleans Mayor Latoya Cantrell said this year's \"We Love Us\" theme was appropriate.\n\n\"This whole 'We Love Us' theme brought us together to build communities,\" she said.\n\nThe festival's impact on the city and state has surpassed $300 million, with more than 500,000 people visiting since 1994.\n\nEssence started the festival as a way to celebrate 25 years of the magazine's history.\n\n\"The locals are being incorporated in a manner that we can see and touch and feel and smell. That has been a part of the evolution of Essence,\" Cantrell said.\n\nThe event's current contract ends in 2026, but Essence Ventures CEO Caroline Wanga has said the festival's \"forever home\" is New Orleans.\n\n\"That's what we believe as well,\" Cantrell said. \"We have a foundation that's been laid over 30 years. The city is always ready and prepared to host this event and more. I think staying in New Orleans is the best fit and best marriage, the best partnership.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Kevin Hagen)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - There was a huge choir that veered from stirring, soaring gospel, then spit verses from Cardi B and sang lines from Queen Latifah's \"U.N.I.T.Y.\"; a spoken word artist who reminded the audience that rock 'n' roll was born because of a black, queer woman ; and a stunning collection of clothes that ran the gamut from casual chic to red carpet gowns, all modeled by black or brown faces.\n\n\"Sister,\" Pyer Moss' latest production for New York Fashion Week, was a brilliant, irreverent and joyous celebration of black culture, specifically black women - a show where even the colorful, eye-catching garments proved to be just part of the story its designer, Kerby Jean-Raymond, masterfully weaved together on Sunday night.\n\n\"The whole thing is really to recognize our worth, and us as black people, what we've contributed to what pop society is in America,\" Jean-Raymond told The Associated Press after his show ended a little before midnight. \"What I aim to do is to make disenfranchised people, black people, with this series and minorities and women, know and understand how important they are to this thing called America right now.\"\n\nThe first sign that the Pyer Moss was going to be something out of the ordinary was its location: Miles from Manhattan, the upstart fashion house held court on Flatbush Avenue, at the Kings Theatre, a venue sitting in one of the more culturally rich black neighborhoods in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nOnce inside the ornate and refurbished venue, a runway was fashioned in front of the stage, and in between stood a piano - another hint that clothes would be merely part of the story Jean-Raymond planned to tell.\n\nWhat followed was a production that borrowed from black music, the black church and other aspects of the culture to pay loving tribute to what African Americans have achieved. Before the show began, spoken word artist Casey Gerald noted the grim anniversary currently being marked worldwide - 400 years since the first enslaved Africans arrived in the United States.\n\nBut instead of sorrow, Gerald emphasized freedom and noted \"we have come here to say we ain't gonna grieve no more . we have come tonight to say you can't hurt us no more.\"\n\nWith that, The Pyer Moss Tabernacle Drip Choir Drenched in the Blood took to the stage and began to sing. Dressed in formal black against a white backdrop, it was the perfect complement to the designs that would grace the runway. Looks included a flowing white tunic with red trim and matching white pants; a brilliant yellow-gold gown with long, billowing sleeves, a skirt that flared at the bottom and a cut-out back; matching men's and women's leather outfits that recalled cowboy chic; and brilliant artwork emblazoned on casual outfits (\"Stranger Things\" star Caleb McLaughlin was one of the models, and wore one of the outfits from the new Reebok by Pyer Moss collection).\n\nAs captivating as the clothes were, they were hard to compete with the choir, which started slow and majestic, with a gospel song, then morphed to deliver snippets of popular works of contemporary black singers, from Anita Baker to Whitney Houston to Missy Elliott: the audience roared as the choir began to rap Elliott's \"The Rain,\" and cheered when it later segued to Cardi B's \"Money,\" and erupted as it went into Adina Howard's \"Freak Like Me.\"\n\nJean-Raymond beamed about his choir afterward, and noted that he had wanted to have more than 100 members, but \"the stage structure couldn't hold all of our swag.\"\n\nJean-Raymond said he chose the songs to pay tribute to the contributions of black women in culture, specifically music. He noted the often overlooked Sister Rosetta Tharpe, who is considered by many to be the rightful creator of rock 'n' roll.\n\n\"And I feel like black women are often erased from things, and I wanted to do this specifically for black women,\" he said.\n\nIt may have been specifically for black women, but the entire audience - which included celebrities ranging from Fantasia to former NBA star Chris Bosh, former NFL star Victor Cruz and actress girlfriend Karrueche Tran, and singer Normani - erupted in applause as it was ending.\n\nIn the end, it was far more than a fashion show, which is what Jean-Raymond - who declared fashion shows boring and elitist - hoped to achieve.\n\n\"I look at this as an art project, and I think the success of it is bringing people closer to me than trying to assimilate into whatever else people are doing,\" he said.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File)\n\nNEW ORLEANS (AP) - Black culture, in all its glory, will be on display over the 4th of July holiday weekend in New Orleans as thousands converge on the city for the in-person return of the Essence Festival of Culture.\n\nThe multiday event begins with a Thursday performance by comedian Kevin Hart in the Smoothie King Center, followed by ticketed concerts at the Louisiana Superdome Friday through Sunday. First-time headliner, rapper Nicki Minaj, performs Friday along with another first-timer, country singer Mickey Guyton. Music icon Janet Jackson, who took the stage in 2010 and 2018, is the featured artist on Saturday and fan favorite, 80s R&B group New Edition, will close the event on Sunday. Other artists scheduled to perform include Jazmine Sullivan, City Girls, Summer Walker, The Roots, The Isley Brothers, Method Man, Tems, Patti LaBelle and Stephanie Mills.\n\nIn addition, free experiences are being offered inside the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center including a tech summit, an opportunity for men called \"In His Zone,\" a marketplace highlighting local vendors, a food and wine experience, a beauty carnival, and the ever-popular gospel celebration.\n\nOrganizers encourage all participants - whether in-person or virtual - to download the festival's app and register through EssenceFestival.com. In addition, in-person participants are required to show proof of a COVID-19 vaccination even though that requirement was dropped in March by the city since the pandemic had eased.\n\nFestival organizers have said \"vaccination is for everyone's protection\" and proof of such is needed for admission.\n\nThe festival, much like others the city is known for, has been on an in-person hiatus since 2020 because of the virus outbreak but was held virtually in 2020 and 2021. Before that, it had been held in New Orleans every year except in 2006 when it moved to Houston while the Superdome was being repaired following Hurricane Katrina.\n\nThis year's theme is \"It's The Black Joy For Me\" and the 2022 festival will be the brand's first to offer a live component and the option to connect virtually.\n\n\"As the nation's largest festival by per day attendance, the Essence Festival of Culture is a staple that celebrates community and empowers equity,\" Essence CEO Caroline Wanga said in a statement. \"We are excited to welcome the family back to New Orleans and thrilled to connect with more of our diasporic family through new digital experiences.\"\n\nErika J. Bennett, chief marketing officer for Essence Ventures, said she's looking forward to what she describes as a \"reunion\" that has attracted more than 500,000 visitors to its events in past years.\n\n\"We know the festival is an opportunity for people, all over the world, to come together, to unite a culture, whether that's through fashion or music or food or all the wonderful other ways we express ourselves. Particularly after some really hard years of not being together, our theme of Black joy, really resonates,\" Bennett said.\n\nBennett said their digital experience opens access globally and has attracted more than 100 million online views.\n\nEssence, in its 27th year, started in 1995 as a one-time salute to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Essence magazine and was known as \"a party with a purpose\" with an original mission to give back to the community through free seminars designed to enrich women's lives. It has since evolved into the world's largest celebration of Black women, culture and community, organizers have said.\n\nBennett said Essence Ventures, the parent company of Essence, supports economic equity for people of color and works to ensure that through all of its brands as part of its purpose.\n\n\"It's important for us to support and uplift a city that's embraced us for so many years,\" she said. \"Through our marketplace and through Essence Eats, we have been able to generate a $2 billion economic impact, over nearly 30 years, to the City of New Orleans. And that is a bigger part, a deeper part of our overall mission.\"\n\nThe city did not immediately respond to an email seeking details about the city's current contract with the festival. The current contract runs through 2024. Discussions are currently being held regarding a contract extension, said John F. Lawson, deputy press secretary for Mayor LaToya Cantrell's administration.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

      "text": "The Source of Black Poverty Isn't Black Culture, It's American Culture\n\nAmericans don't want to imagine that our racist history is actually an ongoing, racist reality.\n\nAmericans don't want to imagine that our racist history is actually an ongoing, racist reality. We like to look at racism as a thing that has gotten better (if not gone away completely) and that the way black Americans are treated in society is actually colorblind. So, if forced to pick between the idea that our country's structures and systems are biased toward white people or the idea that black communities are flawed, many pick the latter. Some doing so, of course, because they're racist.\n\nThe past week has seen an extended and thoughtful debate between New York 's Jonathan Chait and The Atlantic 's Ta-Nehisi Coates over whether cultural forces within the black community are to blame for its enduring poverty. (Links to the various points of the debate are at right.) It began after Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan referred to a culture in the inner city where \"generations of men\" are \"not even thinking about working\" - remarks broadly seen as racially controversial. Coates' first post largely took aim at President Obama's similar remarks putting blame for poverty on black culture. Chait, responding, indicated that many other Democrats agreed with Obama's position (as distinct from Ryan's). Over three more posts, the argument grew more refined, as I'll outline.\n\nHere is what is beyond dispute: In 2012, 35 percent of blacks lived in poverty , compared to 13 percent of whites. In 1970, those rates were 33.6 percent and 10 percent , respectively. Poverty in the black community is higher, and has been consistently.\n\nThere exist three options for that persistence, if we assume that culture might play a role.\n\nThis distinction isn't simply rhetorical. If there are cultural forces at play, one of those three things must be true. What's more, the political implications of each are different. If the black culture explanation is correct, it suggests that admonishments against the behavior of black Americans - the sort of thing that Coates has consistently objected to - are a proper response to entrenched poverty. If there's a culture of poverty, there needs to be a broader cultural realignment among all poor people, one that's not limited to the black community. If there are no internal cultural forces at play, then the \"racism exists\" explanation becomes more significant.\n\nPut more simply, there are three options for why black people continue to experience higher levels of poverty: it's in part black people's fault, it's in part poor people's fault, and it's society's fault. The best answer, without question, is the latter.\n\nLet's say, for the sake of argument, that the problem lies with the second option, that there is something about being poor that results in future generations being poor.\n\nIf this culture exists, what are its components? Ryan's remarks offer one view: it involves \"men not working and just generations of men not even thinking about working or learning the value and the culture of work, and so there is a real culture problem here that has to be dealt with.\" Or, put more crassly, parents who have been out of work take refuge in the welfare state, living on food stamps and government services, and their children learn that this is a viable means of survival.\n\nLast November, the National Bureau of Economic Research published a study suggesting that the children of people who receive government benefits are more likely themselves to receive such benefits. \"[W]hen a parent is allowed [benefits], their adult child's participation over the next five years increases by 6 percentage points,\" its summary reads. \"This effect grows over time, rising to 12 percentage points after ten years.\" (The conservative National Review embraced the argument, unsurprisingly.)\n\nThe study - conducted by looking at Norwegian, not American, benefits usage - found a relationship. But the noticeable uptick in the likelihood of children signing up for benefits programs was to the effect of being 1-in-16 or 1-in-8 more likely to do so. That's hardly a suggestion there is necessarily or even probably a transfer of the inclination to avoid work over generations.\n\nThere simply isn't a strong argument to be made that identifies attributes of enduring poverty from attributes common to the black community. Chait never presents one clearly.\n\nIn fact, in his most recent response to Chait, Coates argues that his opponent confuses the first and second options, conflating black culture with the culture of poverty. Here is what Chait wrote, in the closest approximation of a definition of that culture, and citing a paper linked in this essay by Jamelle Bouie .\n\nCoates' point, in part, is that Chait is pointing to things that are primarily specific to communities of color as being representative of the culture of poverty at large. But, further, that blurring that line tends to happen more when the \"roots of poverty\" being identified are more rampant in the black community.\n\nPerhaps another assumption is in order. Let's assume instead that the black culture option is the correct explanation. That pathology actually is something reserved for black people.\n\nBut again: What are the components of that culture? Paul Ryan got in trouble because he implied that the problem was, in short, laziness. Coates frames it loosely in similar terms - \"black people are less responsible, less moral, or less upstanding\" - which Chait quickly steps away from, preferring the gauzy expression \"cultural norms that inhibited economic success.\" The paper cited by Chait indicates a number of very specific behaviorisms and attitudes, some of which he notes, but it also downplays the idea of \"culture\" as an organizing force.\n\nThe clean overlap with longstanding anti-black stereotypes embodied in the Ryan argument and in Coates' formulation is the problem. It's what got Ryan in trouble. And it's why, from the outset, the black culture formulation should be considered suspect.\n\nIn his most recent post, Coates makes an exhaustive argument demonstrating the lengthy history of racist policies and programs that existed to help white Americans at the expense of black Americans. Chait presents the evolutionary repeal of programs explicitly targeting blacks as progress - the end of slavery, the end of Jim Crow. Coates presents it as refinement, as a softening and blurring of the approach society takes toward putting the interest of whites over blacks. It's the Lee Atwater-ization of institutional racism, manifested on the front page of The New York Times - on the same day that Coates published that essay - in the form of expanded voting restrictions that would keep more black (Democratic) voters from getting to the polls.\n\nBelieving that black culture is primarily at fault means believing that black cultural attitudes are why the black unemployment rate has always been at least 50 percent higher than white unemployment. It likely means assuming that vague, hard-to-identify and complex cultural attitudes are responsible for most of the things on this bulleted list : flat wages, higher rates of arrest for possession of marijuana, higher rates of incarceration, a greater likelihood of being arrested at school, a lower likelihood of being accepted to top-tier colleges. When The Wire noted that black preschoolers are more likely to be expelled from their preschool programs, multiple people wrote in to blame the black culture of single parenthood. It was blamed on black culture.\n\nIs black culture why this 2003 study found that job applicants \"with white-sounding names are 50 percent more likely to get called for an initial interview than applicants with African-American-sounding names\"? American history demonstrates countless examples of racist obstruction of black economic success. Ongoing examples show countless ways in which black Americans are still obstructed in the same way.\n\nIn his essay, linked to by Chait, Jamelle Bouie makes the point that certain aspects of behavior might influence certain aspects of the fight against poverty. But he then makes a critical ancillary point: that the addressing the systemic problems that obviously block black success - like the intentional neglect of poor urban communities - should happen regardless. \"'Culture' might explain the reluctance of individual households and families to leave\" those communities, he writes, \"but it's of limited utility when it comes to the broad phenomenon. In that case, the starting point should be the fact that African Americans deal with a unique set of durable circumstances that have festered and worsened over the last forty years.\" The dominant white culture articulated by Coates and that neglected those communities is the more obvious problem.\n\nIs this so impossible to imagine? America was born with sin and keeps sinning. No matter how fervent your belief in the perfection of the American ideal, you've certainly met enough Americans to know that the ideal may not always be met. Racism is the simplest answer and racism, of all theories, is the one with a robust evidentiary trail.\n\nFinally, consider this: The poverty level in the Hispanic community was 33 percent in 2012. In 1970, the figure was 24.3 percent. Poverty is entrenched in the Hispanic community. Do we blame black culture? Latino culture? Maybe we should consider that Coates is right, and admit that America needs to fix itself before it starts trying to fix the cultures it has spent a long time breaking."

      "text": "Black Pathology and the Closing of the Progressive Mind\n\nHow Jonathan Chait and other Obama-era liberals misunderstand the role of white supremacy in America's history and present\n\nAmong opinion writers, Jonathan Chait is outranked in my esteem only by Hendrik Hertzberg. This lovely takedown of Robert Johnson is a classic of the genre, one I studied incessantly when I was sharpening my own sword. The sharpening never ends. With that in mind, it is a pleasure to engage Chait in the discussion over President Obama, racism, culture, and personal responsibility. It's good to debate a writer of such clarity-even when that clarity has failed him.\n\nOn y va.\n\nChait argues that I've conflated Paul Ryan's view of black poverty with Barack Obama's. He is correct. I should have spent more time disentangling these two notions, and illuminating their common roots-the notion that black culture is part of the problem. I have tried to do this disentangling in the past . I am sorry I did not do it in this instance and will attempt to do so now.\n\nArguing that poor black people are not \"holding up their end of the bargain,\" or that they are in need of moral instruction is an old and dubious tradition in America. There is a conservative and a liberal rendition of this tradition. The conservative version eliminates white supremacy as a factor and leaves the question of the culture's origin ominously unanswered. This version can never be regarded seriously. Life is short. Black life is shorter.\n\nOn y va.\n\nThe liberal version of the cultural argument points to \"a tangle of pathologies\" haunting black America born of oppression. This argument-which Barack Obama embraces-is more sincere, honest, and seductive. Chait helpfully summarizes:\n\nThe argument is that structural conditions shape culture, and culture, in turn, can take on a life of its own independent of the forces that created it. It would be bizarre to imagine that centuries of slavery, followed by systematic terrorism, segregation, discrimination, a legacy wealth gap, and so on did not leave a cultural residue that itself became an impediment to success.\n\nThe \"structural conditions\" Chait outlines above can be summed up under the phrase \"white supremacy.\" I have spent the past two days searching for an era when black culture could be said to be \"independent\" of white supremacy. I have not found one. Certainly the antebellum period, when one third of all enslaved black people found themselves on the auction block, is not such an era. And surely we would not consider postbellum America, when freedpeople were regularly subjected to terrorism, to be such an era.\n\nWe certainly do not find such a period during the Roosevelt-Truman era, when this country erected a racist social safety net, leaving the NAACP to quip that the New Deal was \"like a sieve with holes just big enough for the majority of Negroes to fall through.\" Nor do we find it during the 1940s, '50s and '60s, when African-Americans-as a matter of federal policy-were largely excluded from the legitimate housing market. Nor during the 1980s when we began the erection of a prison-industrial complex so vast that black males now comprise 8 percent of the world's entire incarcerated population .\n\nAnd we do not find an era free of white supremacy in our times either, when the rising number of arrests for marijuana are mostly borne by African-Americans; when segregation drives a foreclosure crisis that helped expand the wealth gap ; when big banks busy themselves baiting black people with \"wealth-building seminars\" and instead offering \"ghetto loans\" for \"mud people\"; when studies find that black low-wage applicants with no criminal record \"fared no better than a white applicant just released from prison\"; when, even after controlling for neighborhoods and crime rates, my son finds himself more likely to be stopped and frisked. Chait's theory of independent black cultural pathologies sounds reasonable. But it can't actually be demonstrated in the American record, and thus has no applicability.\n\nWhat about the idea that white supremacy necessarily \"bred a cultural residue that itself became an impediment to success\"? Chait believes that it's \"bizarre\" to think otherwise. I think it's bizarre that he doesn't bother to see if his argument is actually true. Oppression might well produce a culture of failure. It might also produce a warrior spirit and a deep commitment to attaining the very things which had been so often withheld from you. There is no need for theorizing. The answers are knowable.\n\nThere certainly is no era more oppressive for black people than their 250 years of enslavement in this country. Slavery encompassed not just forced labor, but a ban on black literacy, the vending of black children, the regular rape of black women, and the lack of legal standing for black marriage. Like Chait, 19th-century Northern white reformers coming South after the Civil War expected to find \" a cultural residue that itself became an impediment to success.\"\n\nIn his masterful history, Reconstruction , the historian Eric Foner recounts the experience of the progressives who came to the South as teachers in black schools. The reformers \"had little previous contact with blacks\" and their views were largely cribbed from Uncle Tom's Cabin . They thus believed blacks to be culturally degraded and lacking in family instincts, prone to lie and steal, and generally opposed to self-reliance:\n\nFew Northerners involved in black education could rise above the conviction that slavery had produced a \"degraded\" people, in dire need of instruction in frugality, temperance, honesty, and the dignity of labor ... In classrooms, alphabet drills and multiplication tables alternated with exhortations to piety, cleanliness, and punctuality.\n\nIn short, white progressives coming South expected to find a black community suffering the effects of not just oppression but its \"cultural residue.\"\n\nHere is what they actually found:\n\nDuring the Civil War, John Eaton, who, like many whites, believed that slavery had destroyed the sense of family obligation , was astonished by the eagerness with which former slaves in contraband camps legalized their marriage bonds. The same pattern was repeated when the Freedmen's Bureau and state governments made it possible to register and solemnize slave unions. Many families, in addition, adopted the children of deceased relatives and friends, rather than see them apprenticed to white masters or placed in Freedmen's Bureau orphanages.\n\nBy 1870, a large majority of blacks lived in two-parent family households, a fact that can be gleaned from the manuscript census returns but also \"quite incidentally\" from the Congressional Ku Klux Klan hearings, which recorded countless instances of victims assaulted in their homes, \"the husband and wife in bed, and ... their little children beside them.\"\n\nThe point here is rich and repeated in American history-it was not \"cultural residue\" that threatened black marriages. It was white terrorism, white rapacity, and white violence. And the commitment among freedpeople to marriage mirrored a larger commitment to the reconstitution of family, itself necessary because of systemic white violence.\n\n\"In their eyes,\" wrote an official from the Freedmen's Bureau, in 1865. \"T he work of emancipation was incomplete until the families which had been dispersed by slavery were reunited.\"\n\nWhite people at the time noted a sudden need in black people to travel far and wide. \"The Negroes,\" reports one observer, \"are literally crazy about traveling.\" Why were the Negroes \"literally crazy about traveling?\" Part of it was the sheer joy of mobility granted by emancipation. But there was something more: \"Of all the motivations for black mobility,\" writes Foner, \"none was more poignant than the effort to reunite families separated during slavery.\"\n\nThis effort continued as late the onset of the 20th century, when you could still find newspapers running ads like this:\n\nDuring the year 1849, Thomas Sample carried away from this city, as his slaves, our daughter, Polly, and son .... We will give $100 each for them to any person who will assist them ... to get to Nashville, or get word to us of their whereabouts.\n\nNor had the centuries-long effort to destroy black curiosity and thirst for education yielded much effect :\n\nPerhaps the most striking illustration of the freedmen's quest for self-improvement was their seemingly unquenchable thirst for education .... The desire for learning led parents to migrate to towns and cities in search of education for their children, and plantation workers to make the establishment of a school-house \"an absolute condition\" of signing labor contracts ...\n\nContemporaries could not but note the contrast between white families seemingly indifferent to education and blacks who \"toil and strive, labour and endure in order that their children 'may have a schooling'.\" As one Northern educator remarked: \"Is it not significant that after the lapse of one hundred and forty-four years since the settlement [of Beaufort, North Carolina], the Freedmen are building the first public school-house ever erected here.\"\n\n\"All in all,\" Foner concludes, \"the months following the end of the Civil War were a period of remarkable accomplishment for Southern blacks.\" This is not especially remarkable, if you consider the time. Education, for instance, was not merely a status marker. Literacy was protection against having your land stolen or being otherwise cheated. Perhaps more importantly, it gave access to the Bible. The cultural fruits of oppression are rarely predictable merely through theorycraft. Who would predicted that oppression would make black people hungrier for education than their white peers? Who could predict the blues?\n\nAnd culture is not exclusive. African-American are Americans, and have been Americans longer than virtually any other group of white Americans. There is no reason to suppose that enslavement cut African-Americans off from a broader cultural values. More likely African-Americans contributed to the creation and maintenance of those values.\n\nThe African-Americans who endured enslavement were subject to two and half centuries of degradation and humiliation. Slavery lasted twice as long as Jim Crow and was more repressive. If you were going to see evidence of a \"cultural residue\" which impeded success you would see it there. Instead you find black people desperate to reconstitute their families, desperate to marry, and desperate to be educated. Progressives who advocate the 19th-century line must specifically name the \"cultural residue\" that afflicts black people, and then offer evidence of it. Favoring abstract thought experiments over research will not cut it.\n\nNor will pretending that old debates are somehow new. For some reason there is an entrenched belief among many liberals and conservatives that discussions of American racism should begin somewhere between the Moynihan Report and the Detroit riots. Thus Chait dates our dispute to the fights in the '70s between liberals. In fact, we are carrying on an argument that is at least a century older.\n\nThe passage of time is important because it allows us to assess how those arguments have faired. I contend that my arguments have been borne out, and the arguments of progressives like Chait and the president of the United States have not. Either Booker T. Washington was correct when he urged black people to forgo politics in favor eliminating \" the criminal and loafing element of our people\" or he wasn't. Either W.E.B. Du Bois was correct when he claimed that correcting \"the immorality, crime and laziness among the Negroes\" should be the \"first and primary\" goal or he was not. The track record of progressive moral reform in the black community is knowable.\n\nAnd it's not just knowable from Eric Foner. It can be gleaned from reading the entire Moynihan Report-not just the \"tangle of pathologies\" section-and then comparing it with Herb Gutman's The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom. It can be gleaned from Isabel Wilkerson's history of the Great Migration, The Warmth of Other Suns. One of the most important threads in this book is Wilkerson dismantling of the liberal theory of cultural degradation.\n\nI want to conclude by examining one important element of Chait's argument-the role of the president of the United States who also happens to be a black man:\n\nIf I'm watching a basketball game in which the officials are systematically favoring one team over another (let's call them Team A and Team Duke) as an analyst, the officiating bias may be my central concern. But if I'm coaching Team A, I'd tell my players to ignore the biased officiating. Indeed, I'd be concerned the bias would either discourage them or make them lash out, and would urge them to overcome it. That's not the same as denying bias. It's a sensible practice of encouraging people to concentrate on the things they can control.\n\nObama's habit of speaking about this issue primarily to black audiences is Obama seizing upon his role as the most famous and admired African-American in the world to urge positive habits and behavior.\n\nChait's metaphor is incorrect. Barack Obama isn't the coach of \"Team Negro,\" he is the commissioner of the league. Team Negro is very proud that someone who served on our staff has risen (for the first time in history!) to be commissioner. And Team Negro, which since the dawn of the league has endured biased officiating and whose every game is away, hopes that the commissioner's tenure among them has given him insight into the league's problems. But Team Negro is not-and should not be-confused about the commissioner's primary role.\n\n\"I'm not the president of black America,\" Barack Obama has said. \"I'm the president of the United States of America.\"\n\nPrecisely.\n\nAnd the president of the United States is not just an enactor of policy for today, he is the titular representative of his country's heritage and legacy. In regards to black people, America's heritage is kleptocracy-the stealing and selling of other people's children, the robbery of the fruits of black labor, the pillaging of black property, the taxing of black citizens for schools they can not attend, for pools in which they can not swim, for libraries that bar them, for universities that exclude them, for police who do not protect them, for the marking of whole communities as beyond the protection of the state and thus subject to the purview of outlaws and predators.\n\nThe bearer of this unfortunate heritage feebly urging \"positive habits and behavior\" while his country imprisons some ungodly number of black men may well be greeted with applause in some quarters. It must never be so among those of us whose love of James Baldwin is true, whose love of Ida B. Wells is true, whose love of Harriet Tubman and our ancestors who fought for the right of family is true. In that fight America has rarely been our ally. Very often it has been our nemesis.\n\nObama-era progressives view white supremacy as something awful that happened in the past and the historical vestiges of which still afflict black people today. They believe we need policies-though not race-specific policies-that address the affliction. I view white supremacy as one of the central organizing forces in American life, whose vestiges and practices afflicted black people in the past, continue to afflict black people today, and will likely afflict black people until this country passes into the dust.\n\nThere is no evidence that black people are less responsible, less moral, or less upstanding in their dealings with America nor with themselves. But there is overwhelming evidence that America is irresponsible, immoral, and unconscionable in its dealings with black people and with itself. Urging African-Americans to become superhuman is great advice if you are concerned with creating extraordinary individuals. It is terrible advice if you are concerned with creating an equitable society. The black freedom struggle is not about raising a race of hyper-moral super-humans. It is about all people garnering the right to live like the normal humans they are."

      "text": "The Problem With Being Black, Cont.\n\nThomas Chatterton Williams offered the following response to Dwayne's post from last week. I think people who've been around this blog for awhile can guess where I come down on this--a quick archive search will familiarize you really quickly. Moreover, having talked with many of you for some time, I know where you sit. Behave yourselves. Acting like an ass only gives people an excuse to ignore your logic.\n\nHere's Thomas:\n\nOscar Wilde once quipped that he never read a book he was going to review, \"because it prejudices you so.\" Dwayne Betts must be buried in Wilde these days because he certainly hasn't cracked my memoir, Losing My Cool . Were he to have read the book, however, his guest post last week about my ideas with regard to blackness would surely have been different--perhaps not approving, but at the very least informed. And this, I think, would have benefited the readers of this blog, who responded with interest and intensity to his post and what they were led to believe were my thoughts. Unfortunately, what could have been a serious, open and rewarding conversation about the direction of contemporary black culture (is it misguided or on the right path?) and the relationship between artist and audience (can there be great art without great audiences or is that beside the point?) was instead reduced to a game of telephone.\n\nMr. Betts is a moving and, I think, earnest writer, but he is far from a careful reader or thorough critic. His post begins as a commentary on my book (as he understands it not by reading it but by hearing me discuss it on NPR) and turns into a critique of an essay that I wrote two years ago for the magazine n+1. For some reason, he conflates the subjects of the book and the essay, which, though related, are really not the same. In response, I will address the two separately.\n\nMr. Betts writes with regard to the NPR interview (and by way of that, with regard to my book):\n\n\"The troubling thing about being black is that in the end there is always someone willing to hold your blackness accountable for your failures. For most, this kind of thinking unwittingly sets up a dichotomy or reinforces a dichotomy of blackness and whiteness. So for me, listening to Williams I felt that for him if hip hop = blackness, than [sic] his father's love = whiteness .\"\n\nThe view that he attributes to me, however, is precisely the opposite of my own. In fact, the guiding thread through all of my work up to this point could faithfully be rendered as something like: blackness ≠ reason for failure; blackness ≠ hip-hop; a father's love/scholarship/great art ≠ whiteness. I go to lengths to make this clear.\n\nIn Losing My Cool , I argue repeatedly that it is a terrible lie, which has been foisted on us and sold to us for decades now, that hip-hop culture equals black culture, that being authentically black means keeping it real. My argument in the book is not an interrogation of blackness, which is to say race, it is an interrogation of the black street culture that is overwhelmingly glorified and worshiped throughout black America in the hip-hop era, which is something else entirely.\n\nBut putting the book aside, even in his treatment of my short essay, which, presumably, he has read, he's missed some important shades of meaning, isolating and stripping statements of their context. The essay, which was occasioned by Arnold Rampersad's wonderful biography of Ralph Ellison, sets out to explore Ellison's lifelong obsession with debunking the racist idea that the black experience was somehow an inferior one. In discussing this, it must first be remembered that as far back as W.E.B. Du Bois and Booker T. Washington, there has been a divisive debate within the black community about what exactly it ought to mean to be black in the United States of America. On one hand (Washington's), there is a deep-seated tradition of anti-intellectualism and pragmatism; on the other hand (Du Bois's), there is a distinguished minority tradition of cultivation through cultural education and achievement at the highest level. Ellison was very much a descendant of Du Bois.\n\nWith that said, Mr. Betts takes issue with the following sentence of mine: \"Because the terrible truth is that black America has never--not even during the Harlem Renaissance--produced a whole class of mature cultural elites working and consuming at the very highest standards.\" To which he responds:\n\nWilliams' article takes its title, \"What Do We Who Are Slaves And Black Have To Do With Art,\" from Dubois 1926 NAACP speech, Criteria of Negro Art. I read the article wondering if I'd been witnessing and reading the same tradition of black literature and culture as Williams. John Edgar Wideman, Yusef Komunyakaa, Rita Dove, Richard Wright, Paul Laurence Dunbar, John Coltrane, Thelonius Monk, Dizzy Gillepsie, Charlie Parker, Miles Davis--these folks don't get mentioned at all.\n\nMy argument, however, has been oversimplified to the point of distortion. I wrote that sentence not because I hate black people and prefer white people. I wrote it, on the contrary, because I have read enough about American history to realize--as W.E.B. Du himself pointed out--that given the brutalities of slavery, reconstruction, Jim Crow, structural and institutional racism, and a slew of other horrors, art would seem, and in certain ways probably was, a terrific luxury for a great many blacks. It would have been extraordinary if it didn't seem like that.\n\nOf course I know there are sundry historical examples of great black artists (it is through knowledge of their achievement, in fact, that I can conclude with confidence that black cultural output in the hip-hop era is in relatively poor shape). The statement that Mr. Betts takes me to task over means nothing--or it means something very different, which is the same as nothing--if he refuses to acknowledge that what I am actually talking about is reciprocity between artist and audience, both of whom must produce and consume together to make a culture. The artist, after all, doesn't live or work in a vacuum. The basis for the statement within the essay is to illustrate the degree to which Ellison, the finest black novelist and one of the finest American novelists, in his effort to wield art as a means of rendering the Negro experience a universal one--as Borges did for the Argentine, as Joyce did for the Irish, and as Bellow did for the Jew--was estranged from his own people. And he was not alone in this fate. I go on to make the point--which Mr. Betts conveniently ignores--that the same legendary jazz musicians Mr. Betts would like to see namechecked were themselves never really in rapport with the black masses either. I write:\n\nThe poet and critic Lorenzo Thomas has noted that black artists and jazz musicians were measurably isolated from the wider African-American community and therefore subject to overwhelming outside influence from white critics: \"Neither black audiences nor the musicians themselves seemed to be able to control the aesthetic or commercial direction of [jazz].\" Harold Cruse described this problem most powerfully in his classic 1967 book The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual :\n\n\"The Negro intellectual has never really been held accountable to the black world for his social role [because] the black world cannot and does not support the Negro creative intellectual. The black bourgeoisie does not publish books, does not own and operate theaters or music halls. It plays no role to speak of in Negro music, and is remote from the living realities of the jazz musician who plays his nights in the effete and soulless commercial jungles of American white middle-class café culture.\"\n\nI do not bring up these points of contention to be nitpicky--on the contrary, they are the very essence of the matter. Why does a writer labor over nuance and context if it won't be respected, if a critic insists on ignoring the writing at hand in favor of a more convenient analysis of his or her own particular pet peeves and straw men?\n\nMr. Betts submits the following as though he has found some smoking gun on me:\n\n\"So Williams, with the quickness, writes: '[W]ereas white America has produced its William Faulkners, Frank Lloyd Wrights, Ralph Waldo Emersons, Harvard Universities, Edmund Wilsons, New Yorkers, etc., to serve as hefty counterbalances to the Lindsay Lohans, Donald Trumps, and John D. Rockefellers it creates--i.e., there is a small but healthy highbrow tradition set in place--black America is all too skewed in the direction of P Diddy and the vulgar...'\"\n\nBut what's the beef? Black culture is in many ways in worse shape now than when Du Bois delivered his speech. So many of us are trapped in an intellectual kindergarten, students of a culture that is far too skewed in the direction of hip-hop, sports, entertainment and the vulgar (and this includes the bourgeoisie). I see this statement as being obvious on it's face--not because white is superior to black, which is not my belief at all, but because there is an astounding problem of proportion in contemporary black culture: for every aspiring Toni Morrison there are a thousand aspiring Diddys--worse still, the institutions that we do control and our culture as a whole overwhelmingly tend to prize and reward the Diddys at the expense of the Morrisons--let alone the Ellingtons and the Ellisons. To be sure, America as a whole suffers from such an imbalance, but not to the same extent, frankly.\n\nMr. Betts's concluding point, that there is no pure white art or black art, but that there is simply American art is his best argument, and it is something Ralph Ellison strove his entire career to demonstrate, while at the same time remaining through and through a black artist. In Ellison's view, American culture itself is mongrel in nature. That is, of course, why it was so disappointing to him, and it continues to be troubling to me, that, as Americans, so many black folk fail to lay claim to the entirety of our Western tradition, which spans from Plato to Coltrane, Balzac to Baldwin."

      "text": "What Black Women Hear When They're Called \"Auntie\"\n\nThoughts on a word that provokes a wide range of feelings\n\nThis is a free edition of Unsettled Territory, a newsletter about culture, law, history, and finding meaning in the mundane. Sign up here to get it in your inbox. For access to all editions of the newsletter, including subscriber-only exclusives, subscribe to The Atlantic .\n\nIn the spring of 2017, I noticed that young Black people on social media were referring to congressperson Maxine Waters as \"Auntie Maxine.\" It was a nickname given in response to her witty, acerbic, and wise comments about Donald Trump. A digital public sphere, horrified by his behavior, delighted in Waters' giving him hell.\n\nThat nickname was a harbinger of something that has since become widespread: a renewed use in public of the word auntie in reference to Black women. I must admit, I didn't like it at first. I was irritated that a congressperson was being called \"Auntie\" instead of by her professional title. That is a sign of my own formalism, rooted in the culture of the Black South. I am always wary of those who might diminish the hard-earned professional standing of a Black person.\n\nBut I noticed that Waters embraced the term. And she was not, in fact, diminished by it. Rather, it was a means by which she signaled to young people that she was accepting her appointed role as their advocate and representative in a difficult political era. She was the one who would not be cowed by a boorish and bigoted president and party.\n\nHowever, over the past five years, a number of other distinguished Black women have rejected being called Auntie. They include Oprah Winfrey and Gayle King, filmmaker Ava DuVernay, actor Taraji Henson, singer Mary J. Blige, poet and novelist Honorée Fanonne Jeffers, and journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones. Though each woman has described her own reasons for rejecting the term, the common thread is the history of older Black women being referred to as Auntie by white people during slavery and Jim Crow. It was, in that context, at once a sign of age and a mark of diminishment. Black women were deemed unworthy of being called Mrs. or ma'am, or, as we say in U.S. Black English, \"putting a handle on their names.\"\n\nIn response to that insult, in the Jim Crow South it became common for Black people to refer to respected elders as Miss or Mr. followed by a first name, if the person was well known, and to maintain the formality of a last-name designation in general. They jealously guarded these markers of respect in defiance of the ways the larger society denied them respect at every turn.\n\nOther reasons auntie has been rejected is that the term is considered too familiar, assuming a connection that doesn't exist. And some have spoken out about an implicit ageism in the term, and feeling that to be called an auntie means you must perform some kind of caretaking or advisory service for younger people. Auntie suggests \"older than me,\" and that can feel like a red flag.\n\nWhen these and other Black American women say they don't want to be called \"Auntie\" in public, a common response is to tell them that in most of the Black world (Africa and the Caribbean) as well as Asian cultures, auntie is a respectful term for an elder. In those cultural contexts, auntie is not intended as an insult. It is a sign of appropriateness and a different kind of formalism. And even if it is suggestive of the sexism that exists in nearly every culture when it comes to the place of older women, in these global cultural traditions, auntie is notably different from the racist auntie language in the history of the United States.\n\nMoreover, even in the Black American context, our traditions of \"fictive kinship\"-which refers to how we create networks of family that are neither biological nor legal, but made up of deeply respected social relations-are such that we sometimes also use the word auntie to describe people who are not members of our biological or legal families. But unlike in other parts of the world, this is not usually a general term, but rather a term that goes along with a specific forged relationship.\n\nThe way the global use of the word auntie is colliding with our domestic history reveals how much social media has pushed us to think beyond the boundaries of our nation state. We aren't just talking to people who share our citizenships or identities. There are active discussions beyond the boundaries of the nation about the contours of Blackness.\n\nOf course, Blackness is endlessly varying and vast. There are common threads, but there is also plenty of conflict. There are misunderstandings and projections of stereotypes that lead people from every perspective to dig in their heels. The different social meanings of auntie teach us something important about language. Nouns, especially those that express a relationship, aren't simply abstract concepts. Those words are contextual. The meanings behind their utterance depend upon the habits and dispositions of their speakers and listeners. To designate something as an insult or praise because of a stated intention or perception is too simplistic. I'm afraid if we really want to \"get\" language, we have to hold space for contested and conflicted meanings.\n\nThat said, it should go without saying that regardless of intent, we ought to know not to call people by terms that they reject. Period. Nobody is your auntie who says she does not want to be your auntie, and it is disrespectful to tell her she must be. But once we set that aside, a revealing tension remains.\n\nAuntie is a word that comes with baggage, and young Black people calling Black women over 40 years old \"Auntie\" in the public arena are not carrying that baggage. An \"auntie\" in popular parlance is defined by being independent, attractive, and powerful. Moreover, I think by using auntie we are called to challenge the assumptions that go along with mother . Mothers, and Black mothers in particular, are so often expected to be long-suffering people in eternal service.\n\nSo I am interested in what it means to name a social role for an older woman who is seen as liberated and not defined by caretaking. Reels on IG and posts on TikTok celebrate aunties. They are the women who come into family gatherings unfettered and free to express themselves fully. They may or may not be in the kitchen. They claim their own identities. They do not require a husband or children to be valued, though they may have both. They are shown dancing, playing cards, and telling stories. The depiction, for me, feels freeing precisely because according to cultural norms, Black women of a certain age are not expected to prioritize their own interests, desires, and well-being. \"Aunties\" don't play that. Aunties are fun. Aunties are playful. Aunties give advice with candor, something mothers often hesitate to do, because they are preserving the illusion of parental respectability.\n\nYoung Black people are living in a challenging moment. The rise in white-supremacist ideology and violence in the past decade, combined with the backlash against younger generations' exploration of sexuality and gender identity, the reality of their economic precarity, and the trauma of a global pandemic, weighs heavily on young people. And I think many of them are crafting or imagining fictive kinship bonds with public figures because they're looking for connection and guidance on not just an intellectual level, but an emotional one, too. They seek to be anchored in a society that seems to revel in their culture without valuing their lives. They do want something from us older folks-something that no one is required to give. But that desire comes with an expression and appreciation for the elders who have their necks out in a difficult time, or those who can just bring some joy and levity to heavy seasons.\n\nSo, I've grown tender when it comes to auntie . But I'm still watching and vigilant when it comes to language. In the 21st century, much of the Black popular culture unfolds before a global digital public. So much so that there are constant conversations about how to protect Black cultural exchanges from the voraciousness of the mainstream. Companies are all too eager to access the \"cool\" in Black culture without recognition, appreciation, or compensation. People partake and distort meanings from cultures they neither fully understand nor respect.\n\nThe point is this: Language is always complicated in heterogeneous societies. And on the internet it is even more complicated because digital communities are porous and amorphous. We often don't have any idea to whom we are speaking or listening, or whether we share a cultural, political, or generational common ground with that person. People of Generation X and older (perhaps even some elder Millennials) are not digital natives, and the skepticism we have toward avatars whom we cannot place in the analog world is significant.\n\nSo, even if we celebrate the \"auntie\" archetype, we ought to consider how the word fits in this immense linguistic landscape. Because it doesn't exist in a vacuum. No matter its new meaning, its old meanings can be easily dredged up when conversations don't happen exclusively in Black communities, or in communities in which Black experience and identity are valued. Paying attention to this is important.\n\nAnd that risk may also contribute to why some public figures do not want to be called \"Auntie,\" regardless of the person or intent behind it. These women who have worked hard to achieve a certain professional status have a reason to guard it jealously, given the long-standing American habit of making Black women the mules of the world.\n\nBut I feel differently, at least for now. I have children who are 18 and 15 years old. Over the course of their lives, they have challenged me consistently about my ideas of propriety and call out moments when my formalism is misdirected because something more important is at stake. Because of the ways they have taught me, when I find a new turn of phrase or concept jarring, I try to spend time thinking about it rather than following my knee-jerk reaction. Because if I am to be of use to young people, I must understand where they're coming from.\n\nAnd I do believe I have a responsibility to young people, generally, and specifically to young Black people. What I have learned and what I am able to do with my life is the product of prior generations' labor and commitment. I must pay it forward.\n\nIn reality, not many people call me \"Auntie.\" Professionally, people call me \"Dr.\" or \"Professor.\" I don't expect a \"handle\" from peers my age. But the young people in my family also mostly call me \"Imani,\" just like I grew up calling my aunties by their first names. (Unlike some Black American families we didn't make a big deal of handles and titles.) But there are a handful of children to whom I am auntie, by family or fictive kinship. And when they say \"Auntie\" or \"Titi\" or \"Tati,\" what I hear is gratitude and love. And I am grateful in return. So now, when the word comes from a young Black person I don't know, but who clearly is grateful for what I'm sharing and understands that my lifework is in large measure motivated by love for them, I absolutely feel honored to be their \"auntie.\""

      "text": "The Source of Black Poverty Isn't Black Culture, It's American Culture\n\nAmericans don't want to imagine that our racist history is actually an ongoing, racist reality.\n\nAmericans don't want to imagine that our racist history is actually an ongoing, racist reality. We like to look at racism as a thing that has gotten better (if not gone away completely) and that the way black Americans are treated in society is actually colorblind. So, if forced to pick between the idea that our country's structures and systems are biased toward white people or the idea that black communities are flawed, many pick the latter. Some doing so, of course, because they're racist.\n\nThe past week has seen an extended and thoughtful debate between New York 's Jonathan Chait and The Atlantic 's Ta-Nehisi Coates over whether cultural forces within the black community are to blame for its enduring poverty. (Links to the various points of the debate are at right.) It began after Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan referred to a culture in the inner city where \"generations of men\" are \"not even thinking about working\" - remarks broadly seen as racially controversial. Coates' first post largely took aim at President Obama's similar remarks putting blame for poverty on black culture. Chait, responding, indicated that many other Democrats agreed with Obama's position (as distinct from Ryan's). Over three more posts, the argument grew more refined, as I'll outline.\n\nHere is what is beyond dispute: In 2012, 35 percent of blacks lived in poverty , compared to 13 percent of whites. In 1970, those rates were 33.6 percent and 10 percent , respectively. Poverty in the black community is higher, and has been consistently.\n\nThere exist three options for that persistence, if we assume that culture might play a role.\n\nThis distinction isn't simply rhetorical. If there are cultural forces at play, one of those three things must be true. What's more, the political implications of each are different. If the black culture explanation is correct, it suggests that admonishments against the behavior of black Americans - the sort of thing that Coates has consistently objected to - are a proper response to entrenched poverty. If there's a culture of poverty, there needs to be a broader cultural realignment among all poor people, one that's not limited to the black community. If there are no internal cultural forces at play, then the \"racism exists\" explanation becomes more significant.\n\nPut more simply, there are three options for why black people continue to experience higher levels of poverty: it's in part black people's fault, it's in part poor people's fault, and it's society's fault. The best answer, without question, is the latter.\n\nLet's say, for the sake of argument, that the problem lies with the second option, that there is something about being poor that results in future generations being poor.\n\nIf this culture exists, what are its components? Ryan's remarks offer one view: it involves \"men not working and just generations of men not even thinking about working or learning the value and the culture of work, and so there is a real culture problem here that has to be dealt with.\" Or, put more crassly, parents who have been out of work take refuge in the welfare state, living on food stamps and government services, and their children learn that this is a viable means of survival.\n\nLast November, the National Bureau of Economic Research published a study suggesting that the children of people who receive government benefits are more likely themselves to receive such benefits. \"[W]hen a parent is allowed [benefits], their adult child's participation over the next five years increases by 6 percentage points,\" its summary reads. \"This effect grows over time, rising to 12 percentage points after ten years.\" (The conservative National Review embraced the argument, unsurprisingly.)\n\nThe study - conducted by looking at Norwegian, not American, benefits usage - found a relationship. But the noticeable uptick in the likelihood of children signing up for benefits programs was to the effect of being 1-in-16 or 1-in-8 more likely to do so. That's hardly a suggestion there is necessarily or even probably a transfer of the inclination to avoid work over generations.\n\nThere simply isn't a strong argument to be made that identifies attributes of enduring poverty from attributes common to the black community. Chait never presents one clearly.\n\nIn fact, in his most recent response to Chait, Coates argues that his opponent confuses the first and second options, conflating black culture with the culture of poverty. Here is what Chait wrote, in the closest approximation of a definition of that culture, and citing a paper linked in this essay by Jamelle Bouie .\n\nCoates' point, in part, is that Chait is pointing to things that are primarily specific to communities of color as being representative of the culture of poverty at large. But, further, that blurring that line tends to happen more when the \"roots of poverty\" being identified are more rampant in the black community.\n\nPerhaps another assumption is in order. Let's assume instead that the black culture option is the correct explanation. That pathology actually is something reserved for black people.\n\nBut again: What are the components of that culture? Paul Ryan got in trouble because he implied that the problem was, in short, laziness. Coates frames it loosely in similar terms - \"black people are less responsible, less moral, or less upstanding\" - which Chait quickly steps away from, preferring the gauzy expression \"cultural norms that inhibited economic success.\" The paper cited by Chait indicates a number of very specific behaviorisms and attitudes, some of which he notes, but it also downplays the idea of \"culture\" as an organizing force.\n\nThe clean overlap with longstanding anti-black stereotypes embodied in the Ryan argument and in Coates' formulation is the problem. It's what got Ryan in trouble. And it's why, from the outset, the black culture formulation should be considered suspect.\n\nIn his most recent post, Coates makes an exhaustive argument demonstrating the lengthy history of racist policies and programs that existed to help white Americans at the expense of black Americans. Chait presents the evolutionary repeal of programs explicitly targeting blacks as progress - the end of slavery, the end of Jim Crow. Coates presents it as refinement, as a softening and blurring of the approach society takes toward putting the interest of whites over blacks. It's the Lee Atwater-ization of institutional racism, manifested on the front page of The New York Times - on the same day that Coates published that essay - in the form of expanded voting restrictions that would keep more black (Democratic) voters from getting to the polls.\n\nBelieving that black culture is primarily at fault means believing that black cultural attitudes are why the black unemployment rate has always been at least 50 percent higher than white unemployment. It likely means assuming that vague, hard-to-identify and complex cultural attitudes are responsible for most of the things on this bulleted list : flat wages, higher rates of arrest for possession of marijuana, higher rates of incarceration, a greater likelihood of being arrested at school, a lower likelihood of being accepted to top-tier colleges. When The Wire noted that black preschoolers are more likely to be expelled from their preschool programs, multiple people wrote in to blame the black culture of single parenthood. It was blamed on black culture.\n\nIs black culture why this 2003 study found that job applicants \"with white-sounding names are 50 percent more likely to get called for an initial interview than applicants with African-American-sounding names\"? American history demonstrates countless examples of racist obstruction of black economic success. Ongoing examples show countless ways in which black Americans are still obstructed in the same way.\n\nIn his essay, linked to by Chait, Jamelle Bouie makes the point that certain aspects of behavior might influence certain aspects of the fight against poverty. But he then makes a critical ancillary point: that the addressing the systemic problems that obviously block black success - like the intentional neglect of poor urban communities - should happen regardless. \"'Culture' might explain the reluctance of individual households and families to leave\" those communities, he writes, \"but it's of limited utility when it comes to the broad phenomenon. In that case, the starting point should be the fact that African Americans deal with a unique set of durable circumstances that have festered and worsened over the last forty years.\" The dominant white culture articulated by Coates and that neglected those communities is the more obvious problem.\n\nIs this so impossible to imagine? America was born with sin and keeps sinning. No matter how fervent your belief in the perfection of the American ideal, you've certainly met enough Americans to know that the ideal may not always be met. Racism is the simplest answer and racism, of all theories, is the one with a robust evidentiary trail.\n\nFinally, consider this: The poverty level in the Hispanic community was 33 percent in 2012. In 1970, the figure was 24.3 percent. Poverty is entrenched in the Hispanic community. Do we blame black culture? Latino culture? Maybe we should consider that Coates is right, and admit that America needs to fix itself before it starts trying to fix the cultures it has spent a long time breaking."

      "text": "Gold Teeth Are Beautiful on Their Own Terms\n\nGrills are more than adornment. They're about Black agency.\n\nThere's a poem most Black people know, and even if you don't know it, at one time or another you've lived it or seen someone you love live it.\n\nIt's a poem by Paul Laurence Dunbar called \"We Wear the Mask,\" his seminal ode to how Black folks must show one face to the world and another to ourselves. The verse begins, \"We wear the mask that grins and lies\" and tells a Black American story, about what it feels like to be treated like a problem.\n\nThis, too, is a story about that, but it's also about gold teeth and grills, two words for mostly the same thing: a beauty we chose together, the grin that wears a mask all its own.\n\nSamiah Rahim, 28, a certified diamontologist in New York, has two golds, commissioned from a jeweler she met at a party in 2019. One is a window around her right canine, the other a gap filler between her two front teeth. Front gaps are common in Rahim's family. She figured the best way to honor the gap was to pour gold into it. Her gap filler did its job-it sits between Rahim's front teeth in a rectangle of light. Without knowing it, Rahim was continuing a tradition that has existed for nearly 3,000 years.\n\nThe earliest people to decorate their teeth with precious metals or gems were likely the Etruscans, who wore gold in their teeth as early as 700 B.C. Mayans drilled holes into their teeth to insert jade, a gem with spiritual significance that was considered more valuable than gold. Around A.D. 1300, people in the Philippines decorated their teeth with gold along with practicing other forms of tooth modification, including intentionally blackening their teeth.\n\nHow this aesthetic spilled into American Black culture is not clear. But by the 1980s, when golds had already been a staple of dentistry practice for decades, the gold teeth of the rappers Rakim and Slick Rick and of the boxer Mike Tyson gained a national spotlight. Today, celebrities such as Beyoncé, Nicki Minaj, and Chris Paul wear grills as a fashion accessory, their mouth glimmering.\n\n\"I tell you what,\" says Michael Scott, 65, a dentist in Lexington, Kentucky, who told me he's been practicing dentistry for 28 years and putting on golds for just as long. \"When we want to shine, we want to spend more than anybody else.\" A removable grill might be $200, Scott told me. But clients who opt for multiple permanent gold crowns might spend several thousand dollars.\n\nEvery gold tooth in a Black mouth is a song with no lyrics. I think of how Rochelle Younge, at only 13, draped one of her healthy teeth in gold. Born and raised in St. Louis, Younge had a best friend who was being taken by her mother to get a gold tooth put in, and so they resolved to do it together. Both of them got the crown placed on the left side, matching, each adorning their smile with a slice of the other. I listen to Younge, now 64, speak about this and think of how often I've looked at a gold tooth and seen a kind of North Star, a light that chants \"home.\"\n\nRelated podcast: The short, uneven history of Black representation on television-from Julia to The Cosby Show to today's \"renaissance\"\n\nListen and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | Google Podcasts\n\nAccording to Scott, gold is the best restorative material there is, malleable yet unlikely to fracture once set, allowing for a better marriage between the crown and the biological tooth. Of course, there are some things not even gold can heal. In the early 2000s, Younge decided that it was time to part with the gold tooth that had been in the top left of her mouth for decades. After years of working the front office of a warehouse, she had had enough of the stereotyping that came with wearing a gold tooth. The final indignity came in 2003, when a Black supervisor took it upon himself to tell her, \"You know, that gold is really going to keep holding you back.\"\n\nShe would need to take out the beauty she'd chosen years ago in order to be selected for the job she deserved. Today, Younge's gold tooth sits in an envelope, among some of her other prized possessions. It was replaced with a porcelain model. When I ask what became of her friend, she laughs. They haven't spoken much in the past 10 years but, as far as she knows, the friend still has the matching gold crown installed. Maybe this is also what draws me to gold teeth-not merely the idea of masks but the intimacy of being the same kind of beautiful as someone you love, of choosing that mask together.\n\nIn the mid-'90s, Al Gilles was a high schooler looking to reinvent the gap in his smile. He got a couple of gold teeth, but they were poor quality. There weren't many craftsmen around who could do the gold correctly. The jewelers of the '90s, according to Gilles, knew little about the culture of inner-city kids in New York. They didn't understand that gold was more than shine, he told me-it was part of a lifestyle. His best friend, Jean Midi, enrolled in a trade school for dentistry and began making gold teeth; he offered to make two custom-fitted ones for Gilles. Gilles is now a manager and lead mold fitter at UndergroundGrillz in Brooklyn, of which Midi, in his mid-40s, is the founder and owner.\n\nAmong Black folks, gold teeth have become as much a matter of community as of style. This tradition of ornamentation and healing has lent many Black folks the opportunity to be seen by one another, and the culture built around it continues to grow. I think of Gilles and Midi treating UndergroundGrillz not only as a storefront but as a training ground where they oversee Black and brown jewelers. And I think of what it means to have jewelers who come from the culture, teaching a new generation to give others what Gilles received in the '90s: a chance to be beautiful on his own terms. I consider all of this, what it means that you can dress your whole mouth like the sun and snap it off at a moment's notice, and I think of how beauty, at its best, is a form of agency.\n\nNext: Read Charles Harbison on the muses missing from the fashion industry"

      "text": "Remembering Barkley L. Hendricks, Master of Black Postmodern Portraiture\n\nThe prescient painter-who died at the age of 72-documented the African American figure as a cultural, and commodified, phenomenon.\n\nWhat's Going On , one of the best-known portraits by Barkley L. Hendricks, arrived in 1974, three years after the Marvin Gaye album of the same name. At the time, Gaye's record was well-regarded, but not yet universally recognized as a masterpiece of protest art. Hendricks saw in it something not far off, a moment when black protest music would come into its own as a commercial concern. His striking portrait acknowledged the record's place in the commodification of black culture happening at a break-neck speed in the 1970s.\n\nHendricks, one of the finest figure painters of his generation, died on Tuesday at 72. Large in scale, his paintings combined the tonality of Rembrandt with the sensibility of Andy Warhol. His stylized portraits-realist African American figures set against abstract backgrounds-starred friends and neighbors from his life, posed for timelessness. His broader project was to document the black image as a phenomenon, as it manifested in fashion, billboards, magazines, and movies.\n\nAlong with Philip Pearlstein and David Hockney, Hendricks stands out as a pillar of postmodern portraiture. But he was never a well-known artist. While he is widely cited as a major influence among contemporary black artists today, Hendricks's work is under-represented in American museum collections. That owes in part to his black subject matter, but also to interests that kept him away from painting for almost 20 years.\n\nHe has since emerged as an overlooked but critical artist who touched on Pop Art and historical painting. In a 2009 essay for Artforum , Huey Copeland, an art historian at Northwestern University, wrote that Hendricks's paintings \"illuminate the crisis of blackness within representation-a crisis everywhere shaped by an engagement with and an opposition to those persistent forms of reification, high and low, that transform liberatory self-fashioning into co-opted cliché.\"\n\nCopeland's point about art bridging high and low sources of imagery could easily describe the work of Kehinde Wiley, one of the biggest names in contemporary art today. Wiley's paintings of popular black figures (LL Cool J, Ice-T) in anachronistic, historical modes (Renaissance, Rococo) are forever indebted to Hendricks. The late artist's influence is also evident in the work of Jeff Sonhouse, Mickalene Thomas, Amy Sherald, Rashid Johnson, and others-to say nothing of the scores of painters Hendricks taught at Connecticut College, where he joined the faculty in 1972. (He received both his degrees in art from Yale University.)\n\nHendricks challenged the strictures of the art world in sly and overt ways. In 1977, he painted a life-sized nude of himself, Brilliantly Endowed (Self-Portrait) , so named after a line the art critic Hilton Kramer used to describe his style. Life-sized portraits of everyday black folks were hardly the way of the fine-art world in the 1960s, making him a radical; portraiture in general took a back seat in the 1970s, making him retrograde. His work could be dramatic-like his so-called limited-palette paintings, including What's Going On, with its subjects' crisp, white clothing blending into the background-but in the knowing way of a Blaxploitation movie poster.\n\nIn 2008, the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University organized a retrospective of Hendricks's work that traveled to Harlem's Studio Museum as well as to museums in Santa Monica, Houston, and Philadelphia (where Hendricks was born in 1945). That show, \"Birth of the Cool,\" curated by Trevor Schoonmaker, was the first to re-think Hendricks's role in portraiture, at a time when interest in his work was at an ebb. (He stopped painting from 1984 to 2002, in part to focus on his photography of jazz musicians.) Recently, Hendricks's work has gone up at the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture and at the Studio Museum; his paintings will also be at the center of the upcoming Tate Modern exhibit , \"Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power.\"\n\nIn that show, Hendricks's work may serve as something of a counterpoint. He never painted black people in protest or in crisis. Ideas about black nationalisms surfaced in his work as they were reflected in the world of images. He borrowed endlessly from the commercialization of black culture-a Pop Art way of turning the white gaze back in on itself. The artists who have followed in his footsteps are sometimes described as \"post-black.\" Hendricks may have beaten them to that."

      "text": "My President Was Black\n\nA history of the first African American White House-and of what came next\n\n\"They're a rotten crowd,\" I shouted across the lawn. \"You're worth the whole damn bunch put together.\"\n\n- F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Great Gatsby\n\nIn the waning days of President Barack Obama's administration, he and his wife, Michelle, hosted a farewell party, the full import of which no one could then grasp. It was late October, Friday the 21st, and the president had spent many of the previous weeks, as he would spend the two subsequent weeks, campaigning for the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton. Things were looking up. Polls in the crucial states of Virginia and Pennsylvania showed Clinton with solid advantages. The formidable GOP strongholds of Georgia and Texas were said to be under threat. The moment seemed to buoy Obama. He had been light on his feet in these last few weeks, cracking jokes at the expense of Republican opponents and laughing off hecklers. At a rally in Orlando on October 28, he greeted a student who would be introducing him by dancing toward her and then noting that the song playing over the loudspeakers-the Gap Band's \"Outstanding\"-was older than she was. \"This is classic!\" he said. Then he flashed the smile that had launched America's first black presidency, and started dancing again. Three months still remained before Inauguration Day, but staffers had already begun to count down the days. They did this with a mix of pride and longing-like college seniors in early May. They had no sense of the world they were graduating into. None of us did.\n\nThe farewell party, presented by BET (Black Entertainment Television), was the last in a series of concerts the first couple had hosted at the White House. Guests were asked to arrive at 5:30 p.m. By 6, two long lines stretched behind the Treasury Building, where the Secret Service was checking names. The people in these lines were, in the main, black, and their humor reflected it. The brisker queue was dubbed the \"good-hair line\" by one guest, and there was laughter at the prospect of the Secret Service subjecting us all to a \"brown-paper-bag test.\" This did not come to pass, but security was tight. Several guests were told to stand in a makeshift pen and wait to have their backgrounds checked a second time.\n\nListen to the audio version of this article: Download the Audm app for your iPhone to listen to more titles.\n\nDave Chappelle was there. He coolly explained the peril and promise of comedy in what was then still only a remotely potential Donald Trump presidency: \"I mean, we never had a guy have his own pussygate scandal.\" Everyone laughed. A few weeks later, he would be roundly criticized for telling a crowd at the Cutting Room, in New York, that he had voted for Clinton but did not feel good about it. \"She's going to be on a coin someday,\" Chappelle said. \"And her behavior has not been coinworthy.\" But on this crisp October night, everything felt inevitable and grand. There was a slight wind. It had been in the 80s for much of that week. Now, as the sun set, the season remembered its name. Women shivered in their cocktail dresses. Gentlemen chivalrously handed over their suit coats. But when Naomi Campbell strolled past the security pen in a sleeveless number, she seemed as invulnerable as ever.\n\nCellphones were confiscated to prevent surreptitious recordings from leaking out. (This effort was unsuccessful. The next day, a partygoer would tweet a video of the leader of the free world dancing to Drake's \"Hotline Bling.\") After withstanding the barrage of security, guests were welcomed into the East Wing of the White House, and then ushered back out into the night, where they boarded a succession of orange-and-green trolleys. The singer and actress Janelle Monáe, her famous and fantastic pompadour preceding her, stepped on board and joked with a companion about the historical import of \"sitting in the back of the bus.\" She took a seat three rows from the front and hummed into the night. The trolley dropped the guests on the South Lawn, in front of a giant tent. The South Lawn's fountain was lit up with blue lights. The White House proper loomed like a ghost in the distance. I heard the band, inside, beginning to play Al Green's \"Let's Stay Together.\"\n\n\"Well, you can tell what type of night this is,\" Obama said from the stage, opening the event. \"Not the usual ruffles and flourishes!\"\n\nThe crowd roared.\n\n\"This must be a BET event!\"\n\nThe crowd roared louder still.\n\nObama placed the concert in the White House's musical tradition, noting that guests of the Kennedys had once done the twist at the residence-\"the twerking of their time,\" he said, before adding, \"There will be no twerking tonight. At least not by me.\"\n\nThe Obamas are fervent and eclectic music fans. In the past eight years, they have hosted performances at the White House by everyone from Mavis Staples to Bob Dylan to Tony Bennett to the Blind Boys of Alabama. After the rapper Common was invited to perform in 2011, a small fracas ensued in the right-wing media. He performed anyway-and was invited back again this glorious fall evening and almost stole the show. The crowd sang along to the hook for his hit ballad \"The Light.\" And when he brought on the gospel singer Yolanda Adams to fill in for John Legend on the Oscar-winning song \"Glory,\" glee turned to rapture.\n\nDe La Soul was there. The hip-hop trio had come of age as boyish B-boys with Gumby-style high-top fades. Now they moved across the stage with a lovely mix of lethargy and grace, like your favorite uncle making his way down the Soul Train line, wary of throwing out a hip. I felt a sense of victory watching them rock the crowd, all while keeping it in the pocket. The victory belonged to hip-hop-an art form birthed in the burning Bronx and now standing full grown, at the White House, unbroken and unedited. Usher led the crowd in a call-and-response: \"Say it loud, I'm black and I'm proud.\" Jill Scott showed off her operatic chops. Bell Biv DeVoe, contemporaries of De La, made history with their performance by surely becoming the first group to suggest to a presidential audience that one should \"never trust a big butt and a smile.\"\n\nThe ties between the Obama White House and the hip-hop community are genuine. The Obamas are social with Beyoncé and Jay-Z. They hosted Chance the Rapper and Frank Ocean at a state dinner, and last year invited Swizz Beatz, Busta Rhymes, and Ludacris, among others, to discuss criminal-justice reform and other initiatives. Obama once stood in the Rose Garden passing large flash cards to the Hamilton creator and rapper Lin-Manuel Miranda, who then freestyled using each word on the cards. \"Drop the beat,\" Obama said, inaugurating the session. At 55, Obama is younger than pioneering hip-hop artists like Afrika Bambaataa, DJ Kool Herc, and Kurtis Blow. If Obama's enormous symbolic power draws primarily from being the country's first black president, it also draws from his membership in hip-hop's foundational generation.\n\nThat night, the men were sharp in their gray or black suits and optional ties. Those who were not in suits had chosen to make a statement, like the dark-skinned young man who strolled in, sockless, with blue jeans cuffed so as to accentuate his gorgeous black-suede loafers. Everything in his ensemble seemed to say, \"My fellow Americans, do not try this at home.\" There were women in fur jackets and high heels; others with sculpted naturals, the sides shaved close, the tops blooming into curls; others still in gold bamboo earrings and long blond dreads. When the actor Jesse Williams took the stage, seemingly awed before such black excellence, before such black opulence, assembled just feet from where slaves had once toiled, he simply said, \"Look where we are. Look where we are right now.\"\n\nThis would not happen again, and everyone knew it. It was not just that there might never be another African American president of the United States. It was the feeling that this particular black family, the Obamas, represented the best of black people, the ultimate credit to the race, incomparable in elegance and bearing. \"There are no more,\" the comedian Sinbad joked back in 2010. \"There are no black men raised in Kansas and Hawaii. That's the last one. Y'all better treat this one right. The next one gonna be from Cleveland. He gonna wear a perm. Then you gonna see what it's really like.\" Throughout their residency, the Obamas had refrained from showing America \"what it's really like,\" and had instead followed the first lady's motto, \"When they go low, we go high.\" This was the ideal-black and graceful under fire-saluted that evening. The president was lionized as \"our crown jewel.\" The first lady was praised as the woman \"who put the O in Obama .\"\n\nBarack Obama's victories in 2008 and 2012 were dismissed by some of his critics as merely symbolic for African Americans. But there is nothing \"mere\" about symbols. The power embedded in the word nigger is also symbolic. Burning crosses do not literally raise the black poverty rate, and the Confederate flag does not directly expand the wealth gap.\n\nMuch as the unbroken ranks of 43 white male presidents communicated that the highest office of government in the country-indeed, the most powerful political offices in the world-was off-limits to black individuals, the election of Barack Obama communicated that the prohibition had been lifted. It communicated much more. Before Obama triumphed in 2008, the most-famous depictions of black success tended to be entertainers or athletes. But Obama had shown that it was \"possible to be smart and cool at the same damn time,\" as Jesse Williams put it at the BET party. Moreover, he had not embarrassed his people with a string of scandals. Against the specter of black pathology, against the narrow images of welfare moms and deadbeat dads, his time in the White House had been an eight-year showcase of a healthy and successful black family spanning three generations, with two dogs to boot. In short, he became a symbol of black people's everyday, extraordinary Americanness.\n\nWhiteness in America is a different symbol-a badge of advantage. In a country of professed meritocratic competition, this badge has long ensured an unerring privilege, represented in a 220-year monopoly on the highest office in the land. For some not-insubstantial sector of the country, the elevation of Barack Obama communicated that the power of the badge had diminished. For eight long years, the badge-holders watched him. They saw footage of the president throwing bounce passes and shooting jumpers. They saw him enter a locker room, give a businesslike handshake to a white staffer, and then greet Kevin Durant with something more soulful. They saw his wife dancing with Jimmy Fallon and posing, resplendent, on the covers of magazines that had, only a decade earlier, been almost exclusively, if unofficially, reserved for ladies imbued with the great power of the badge.\n\nFor the preservation of the badge, insidious rumors were concocted to denigrate the first black White House. Obama gave free cellphones to disheveled welfare recipients. Obama went to Europe and complained that \"ordinary men and women are too small-minded to govern their own affairs.\" Obama had inscribed an Arabic saying on his wedding ring, then stopped wearing the ring, in observance of Ramadan. He canceled the National Day of Prayer; refused to sign certificates for Eagle Scouts; faked his attendance at Columbia University; and used a teleprompter to address a group of elementary-school students. The badge-holders fumed. They wanted their country back. And, though no one at the farewell party knew it, in a couple of weeks they would have it.\n\nOn this October night, though, the stage belonged to another America. At the end of the party, Obama looked out into the crowd, searching for Dave Chappelle. \"Where's Dave?\" he cried. And then, finding him, the president referenced Chappelle's legendary Brooklyn concert. \"You got your block party. I got my block party.\" Then the band struck up Al Green's \"Love and Happiness\"-the evening's theme. The president danced in a line next to Ronnie DeVoe. Together they mouthed the lyrics: \"Make you do right. Love will make you do wrong.\"\n\nLast spring , I went to the White House to meet the president for lunch. I arrived slightly early and sat in the waiting area. I was introduced to a deaf woman who worked as the president's receptionist, a black woman who worked in the press office, a Muslim woman in a head scarf who worked on the National Security Council, and an Iranian American woman who worked as a personal aide to the president. This receiving party represented a healthy cross section of the people Donald Trump had been mocking, and would continue to spend his campaign mocking. At the time, the president seemed untroubled by Trump. When I told Obama that I thought Trump's candidacy was an explicit reaction to the fact of a black president, he said he could see that, but then enumerated other explanations. When assessing Trump's chances, he was direct: He couldn't win.\n\nSubscribe to The Atlantic and support 160 years of independent journalism\n\nThis assessment was born out of the president's innate optimism and unwavering faith in the ultimate wisdom of the American people-the same traits that had propelled his unlikely five-year ascent from assemblyman in the Illinois state legislature to U.S. senator to leader of the free world. The speech that launched his rise, the keynote address at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, emerged right from this logic. He addressed himself to his \"fellow Americans, Democrats, Republicans, independents,\" all of whom, he insisted, were more united than they had been led to believe. America was home to devout worshippers and Little League coaches in blue states, civil libertarians and \"gay friends\" in red states. The presumably white \"counties around Chicago\" did not want their taxes burned on welfare, but they didn't want them wasted on a bloated Pentagon budget either. Inner-city black families, no matter their perils, understood \"that government alone can't teach our kids to learn ... that children can't achieve unless we raise their expectations and turn off the television sets and eradicate the slander that says a black youth with a book is acting white.\"\n\nPerceived differences were the work of \"spinmasters and negative-ad peddlers who embrace the politics of 'anything goes.' \" Real America had no use for such categorizations. By Obama's lights, there was no liberal America, no conservative America, no black America, no white America, no Latino America, no Asian America, only \"the United States of America.\" All these disparate strands of the American experience were bound together by a common hope:\n\nThis speech ran counter to the history of the people it sought to address. Some of those same immigrants had firebombed the homes of the children of those same slaves. That young naval lieutenant was an imperial agent for a failed, immoral war. American division was real. In 2004, John Kerry did not win a single southern state. But Obama appealed to a belief in innocence-in particular a white innocence-that ascribed the country's historical errors more to misunderstanding and the work of a small cabal than to any deliberate malevolence or widespread racism. America was good. America was great.\n\nOver the next 12 years, I came to regard Obama as a skilled politician, a deeply moral human being, and one of the greatest presidents in American history. He was phenomenal-the most agile interpreter and navigator of the color line I had ever seen. He had an ability to emote a deep and sincere connection to the hearts of black people, while never doubting the hearts of white people. This was the core of his 2004 keynote, and it marked his historic race speech during the 2008 campaign at Philadelphia's National Constitution Center-and blinded him to the appeal of Trump. (\"As a general proposition, it's hard to run for president by telling people how terrible things are,\" Obama once said to me.)\n\nBut if the president's inability to cement his legacy in the form of Hillary Clinton proved the limits of his optimism, it also revealed the exceptional nature of his presidential victories. For eight years Barack Obama walked on ice and never fell. Nothing in that time suggested that straight talk on the facts of racism in American life would have given him surer footing.\n\nI had met the president a few times before. In his second term, I'd written articles criticizing him for his overriding trust in color-blind policy and his embrace of \"personal responsibility\" rhetoric when speaking to African Americans. I saw him as playing both sides. He would invoke his identity as a president of all people to decline to advocate for black policy-and then invoke his black identity to lecture black people for continuing to \"make bad choices.\" In response, Obama had invited me, along with other journalists, to the White House for off-the-record conversations. I attempted to press my points in these sessions. My efforts were laughable and ineffective. I was always inappropriately dressed, and inappropriately calibrated in tone: In one instance, I was too deferential; in another, too bellicose. I was discombobulated by fear-not by fear of the power of his office (though that is a fearsome and impressive thing) but by fear of his obvious brilliance. It is said that Obama speaks \"professorially,\" a fact that understates the quickness and agility of his mind. These were not like press conferences-the president would speak in depth and with great familiarity about a range of subjects. Once, I watched him effortlessly reply to queries covering everything from electoral politics to the American economy to environmental policy. And then he turned to me. I thought of George Foreman, who once booked an exhibition with multiple opponents in which he pounded five straight journeymen-and I suddenly had some idea of how it felt to be the last of them.\n\nLast spring, we had a light lunch. We talked casually and candidly. He talked about the brilliance of LeBron James and Stephen Curry-not as basketball talents but as grounded individuals. I asked him whether he was angry at his father, who had abandoned him at a young age to move back to Kenya, and whether that motivated any of his rhetoric. He said it did not, and he credited the attitude of his mother and grandparents for this. Then it was my turn to be autobiographical. I told him that I had heard the kind of \"straighten up\" talk he had been giving to black youth, for instance in his 2013 Morehouse commencement address, all my life. I told him that I thought it was not sensitive to the inner turmoil that can be obscured by the hardness kids often evince. I told him I thought this because I had once been one of those kids. He seemed to concede this point, but I couldn't tell whether it mattered to him. Nonetheless, he agreed to a series of more formal conversations on this and other topics.\n\nThe improbability of a black president had once been so strong that its most vivid representations were comedic. Witness Dave Chappelle's profane Black Bush from the early 2000s (\"This nigger very possibly has weapons of mass destruction! I can't sleep on that!\") or Richard Pryor's black president in the 1970s promising black astronauts and black quarterbacks (\"Ever since the Rams got rid of James Harris, my jaw's been uptight!\"). In this model, so potent is the force of blackness that the presidency is forced to conform to it. But once the notion advanced out of comedy and into reality, the opposite proved to be true.\n\nObama's DNC speech is the key. It does not belong to the literature of \"the struggle\"; it belongs to the literature of prospective presidents-men (as it turns out) who speak not to gravity and reality, but to aspirations and dreams. When Lincoln invoked the dream of a nation \"conceived in liberty\" and pledged to the ideal that \"all men are created equal,\" he erased the near-extermination of one people and the enslavement of another. When Roosevelt told the country that \"the only thing we have to fear is fear itself,\" he invoked the dream of American omnipotence and boundless capability. But black people, then living under a campaign of terror for more than half a century, had quite a bit to fear, and Roosevelt could not save them. The dream Ronald Reagan invoked in 1984-that \"it's morning again in America\"-meant nothing to the inner cities, besieged as they were by decades of redlining policies, not to mention crack and Saturday-night specials. Likewise, Obama's keynote address conflated the slave and the nation of immigrants who profited from him. To reinforce the majoritarian dream, the nightmare endured by the minority is erased. That is the tradition to which the \"skinny kid with a funny name\" who would be president belonged. It is also the only tradition in existence that could have possibly put a black person in the White House.\n\nObama's embrace of white innocence was demonstrably necessary as a matter of political survival. Whenever he attempted to buck this directive, he was disciplined. His mild objection to the arrest of Henry Louis Gates Jr. in 2009 contributed to his declining favorability numbers among whites-still a majority of voters. His comments after the killing of Trayvon Martin-\"If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon\"-helped make that tragedy a rallying point for people who did not care about Martin's killer as much as they cared about finding ways to oppose the president. Michael Tesler, a political-science professor at UC Irvine, has studied the effect of Obama's race on the American electorate. \"No other factor, in fact, came close to dividing the Democratic primary electorate as powerfully as their feelings about African Americans,\" he and his co-author, David O. Sears, concluded in their book, Obama's Race: The 2008 Election and the Dream of a Post-Racial America . \"The impact of racial attitudes on individual vote decisions ... was so strong that it appears to have even outstripped the substantive impact of racial attitudes on Jesse Jackson's more racially charged campaign for the nomination in 1988.\" When Tesler looked at the 2012 campaign in his second book, Post-Racial or Most-Racial? Race and Politics in the Obama Era , very little had improved. Analyzing the extent to which racial attitudes affected people associated with Obama during the 2012 election, Tesler concluded that \"racial attitudes spilled over from Barack Obama into mass assessments of Mitt Romney, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Charlie Crist, and even the Obama family's dog Bo.\"\n\nYet despite this entrenched racial resentment, and in the face of complete resistance by congressional Republicans, overtly launched from the moment Obama arrived in the White House, the president accomplished major feats. He remade the nation's health-care system. He revitalized a Justice Department that vigorously investigated police brutality and discrimination, and he began dismantling the private-prison system for federal inmates. Obama nominated the first Latina justice to the Supreme Court, gave presidential support to marriage equality, and ended the U.S. military's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy, thus honoring the civil-rights tradition that had inspired him. And if his very existence inflamed America's racist conscience, it also expanded the country's anti-racist imagination. Millions of young people now know their only president to have been an African American. Writing for The New Yorker , Jelani Cobb once noted that \"until there was a black Presidency it was impossible to conceive of the limitations of one.\" This is just as true of the possibilities. In 2014, the Obama administration committed itself to reversing the War on Drugs through the power of presidential commutation. The administration said that it could commute the sentences of as many as 10,000 prisoners. As of November, the president had commuted only 944 sentences. By any measure, Obama's effort fell woefully short, except for this small one: the measure of almost every other modern president who preceded him. Obama's 944 commutations are the most in nearly a century-and more than the past 11 presidents' combined.\n\nObama was born into a country where laws barring his very conception-let alone his ascendancy to the presidency-had long stood in force. A black president would always be a contradiction for a government that, throughout most of its history, had oppressed black people. The attempt to resolve this contradiction through Obama-a black man with deep roots in the white world-was remarkable. The price it exacted, incredible. The world it gave way to, unthinkable.\n\nWhen Barack Obama was 10, his father gave him a basketball, a gift that connected the two directly. Obama was born in 1961 in Hawaii and raised by his mother, Ann Dunham, who was white, and her parents, Stanley and Madelyn. They loved him ferociously, supported him emotionally, and encouraged him intellectually. They also told him he was black. Ann gave him books to read about famous black people. When Obama's mother had begun dating his father, the news had not been greeted with the threat of lynching (as it might have been in various parts of the continental United States), and Obama's grandparents always spoke positively of his father. This biography makes Obama nearly unique among black people of his era.\n\nIn the president's memoir, Dreams From My Father , he says he was not an especially talented basketball player, but he played with a consuming passion. That passion was directed at something more than just the mastering of the pick-and-roll or the perfecting of his jump shot. Obama came of age during the time of the University of Hawaii basketball team's \"Fabulous Five\"-a name given to its all-black starting five, two decades before it would be resurrected at the University of Michigan by the likes of Chris Webber and Jalen Rose. In his memoir, Obama writes that he would watch the University of Hawaii players laughing at \"some inside joke,\" winking \"at the girls on the sidelines,\" or \"casually flipping lay-ups.\" What Obama saw in the Fabulous Five was not just game, but a culture he found attractive:\n\nThese are lessons, particularly the last one, that for black people apply as much on the street as they do on the court. Basketball was a link for Obama, a medium for downloading black culture from the mainland that birthed the Fabulous Five. Assessing his own thought process at the time, Obama writes, \"I decided to become part of that world.\" This is one of the most incredible sentences ever written in the long, decorated history of black memoir, if only because very few black people have ever enjoyed enough power to write it.\n\nHistorically, in black autobiography, to be remanded into the black race has meant exposure to a myriad of traumas, often commencing in childhood. Frederick Douglass is separated from his grandmother. The enslaved Harriet Ann Jacobs must constantly cope with the threat of rape before she escapes. After telling his teacher he wants to be a lawyer, Malcolm X is told that the job isn't for \"niggers.\" Black culture often serves as the balm for such traumas, or even the means to resist them. Douglass finds the courage to face the \"slave-breaker\" Edward Covey after being given an allegedly enchanted root by \"a genuine African\" possessing powers from \"the eastern nations.\" Malcolm X's dancing connects him to his \"long-suppressed African instincts.\" If black racial identity speaks to all the things done to people of recent African ancestry, black cultural identity was created in response to them. The division is not neat; the two are linked, and it is incredibly hard to be a full participant in the world of cultural identity without experiencing the trauma of racial identity.\n\nObama is somewhat different. He writes of bloodying the nose of a white kid who called him a \"coon,\" and of chafing at racist remarks from a tennis coach, and of feeling offended after a white woman in his apartment building told the manager that he was following her. But the kinds of traumas that marked African Americans of his generation-beatings at the hands of racist police, being herded into poor schools, grinding out a life in a tenement building-were mostly abstract for him. Moreover, the kind of spatial restriction that most black people feel at an early age-having rocks thrown at you for being on the wrong side of the tracks, for instance-was largely absent from his life. In its place, Obama was gifted with a well-stamped passport and admittance to elite private schools-all of which spoke of other identities, other lives and other worlds where the color line was neither determinative nor especially relevant. Obama could have grown into a raceless cosmopolitan. Surely he would have lived in a world of problems, but problems not embodied by him.\n\nInstead, he decided to enter this world.\n\n\"I always felt as if being black was cool,\" Obama told me while traveling to a campaign event. He was sitting on Air Force One , his tie loosened, his shirtsleeves rolled up. \"[Being black] was not something to run away from but something to embrace. Why that is, I think, is complicated. Part of it is I think that my mother thought black folks were cool, and if your mother loves you and is praising you-and says you look good, are smart-as you are, then you don't kind of think in terms of How can I avoid this? You feel pretty good about it.\"\n\nAs a child, Obama's embrace of blackness was facilitated, not impeded, by white people. Obama's mother pointed him toward the history and culture of African Americans. Stanley, his grandfather, who came originally from Kansas, took him to basketball games at the University of Hawaii, as well as to black bars. Stanley introduced him to the black writer Frank Marshall Davis. The facilitation was as much indirect as direct. Obama recalls watching his grandfather at those black bars and understanding that \"most of the people in the bar weren't there out of choice,\" and that \"our presence there felt forced.\" From his mother's life of extensive travel, he learned to value the significance of having a home.\n\nThat suspicion of rootlessness extends throughout Dreams From My Father . He describes integration as a \"one-way street\" on which black people are asked to abandon themselves to fully experience America's benefits. Confronted with a woman named Joyce, a mixed-race, green-eyed college classmate who insists that she is not \"black\" but \"multiracial,\" Obama is scornful. \"That was the problem with people like Joyce,\" he writes. \"They talked about the richness of their multicultural heritage and it sounded real good, until you noticed that they avoided black people.\" Later in the memoir, Obama tells the story of falling in love with a white woman. During a visit to her family's country house, he found himself in the library, which was filled with pictures of the woman's illustrious relations. But instead of being in awe, Obama realized that he and the woman lived in different worlds. \"And I knew that if we stayed together, I'd eventually live in hers,\" he writes. \"Between the two of us, I was the one who knew how to live as an outsider.\"\n\nAfter college, Obama found a home, as well as a sense of himself, working on the South Side of Chicago as a community organizer. \"When I started doing that work, my story merges with a larger story. That happens naturally for a John Lewis,\" he told me, referring to the civil-rights hero and Democratic congressman. \"That happens more naturally for you. It was less obvious to me. How do I pull all these different strains together: Kenya and Hawaii and Kansas, and white and black and Asian-how does that fit? And through action, through work, I suddenly see myself as part of the bigger process for, yes, delivering justice for the [African American community] and specifically the South Side community, the low-income people-justice on behalf of the African American community. But also thereby promoting my ideas of justice and equality and empathy that my mother taught me were universal. So I'm in a position to understand those essential parts of me not as separate and apart from any particular community but connected to every community. And I can fit the African American struggle for freedom and justice in the context of the universal aspiration for freedom and justice.\"\n\nThroughout Obama's 2008 campaign and into his presidency, this attitude proved key to his deep support in the black community. African Americans, weary of high achievers who distanced themselves from their black roots, understood that Obama had paid a price for checking \"black\" on his census form, and for living black, for hosting Common, for brushing dirt off his shoulder during the primaries, for marrying a woman who looked like Michelle Obama. If women, as a gender, must suffer the constant evaluations and denigrations of men, black women must suffer that, plus a broad dismissal from the realm of what American society deems to be beautiful. But Michelle Obama is beautiful in the way that black people know themselves to be. Her prominence as first lady directly attacks a poison that diminishes black girls from the moment they are capable of opening a magazine or turning on a television.\n\nThe South Side of Chicago, where Obama began his political career, is home to arguably the most prominent and storied black political establishment in the country. In addition to Oscar Stanton De Priest, the first African American elected to Congress in the 20th century, the South Side produced the city's first black mayor, Harold Washington; Jesse Jackson, who twice ran for president; and Carol Moseley Braun, the first African American woman to win a Senate race. These victories helped give rise to Obama's own. Harold Washington served as an inspiration to Obama and looms heavily over the Chicago section of Dreams From My Father .\n\nWashington forged the kind of broad coalition that Obama would later assemble nationally. But Washington did this in the mid-1980s in segregated Chicago, and he had not had the luxury, as Obama did, of becoming black with minimal trauma. \"There was an edge to Harold that frightened some white voters,\" David Axelrod, who worked for both Washington and Obama, told me recently. Axelrod recalled sitting around a conference table with Washington after he had won the Democratic primary for his reelection in 1987, just as the mayor was about to hold a press conference. Washington asked what percentage of Chicago's white vote he'd received. \"And someone said, 'Well, you got 21 percent. And that's really good because last time' \"-in his successful 1983 mayoral campaign-\" 'you only got 8,' \" Axelrod recalled. \"And he kind of smiled, sadly, and said, 'You know, I probably spent 70 percent of my time in those white neighborhoods, and I think I've been a good mayor for everybody, and I got 21 percent of the white vote and we think it's good.' And he just kind of shook his head and said, 'Ain't it a bitch to be a black man in the land of the free and the home of the brave?'\n\n\"That was Harold. He felt those things. He had fought in an all-black unit in World War II. He had come up in times-and that and the sort of indignities of what you had to do to come up through the machine really seared him.\" During his 1983 mayoral campaign, Washington was loudly booed outside a church in northwest Chicago by middle-class Poles, Italians, and Irish, who feared blacks would uproot them. \"It was as vicious and ugly as anything you would have seen in the old South,\" Axelrod said.\n\nObama's ties to the South Side tradition that Washington represented were complicated. Like Washington, Obama attempted to forge a coalition between black South Siders and the broader community. But Obama, despite his adherence to black cultural mores, was, with his roots in Kansas and Hawaii, his Ivy League pedigree, and his ties to the University of Chicago, still an exotic out-of-towner. \"They were a bit skeptical of him,\" says Salim Muwakkil, a journalist who has covered Obama since before his days in the Illinois state Senate. \"Chicago is a very insular community, and he came from nowhere, seemingly.\"\n\nObama compounded people's suspicions by refusing to humble himself and go along with the political currents of the South Side. \"A lot of the politicians, especially the black ones, were just leery of him,\" Kaye Wilson, the godmother to Obama's children and one of the president's earliest political supporters, told me recently.\n\nBut even as many in the black political community were skeptical of Obama, others encouraged him-sometimes when they voted against him. When Obama lost the 2000 Democratic-primary race against Bobby Rush, the African American incumbent congressman representing Illinois' First Congressional District, the then-still-obscure future president experienced the defeat as having to do more with his age than his exoticism. \"I'd go meet people and I'd knock on doors and stuff, and some of the grandmothers who were the folks I'd been organizing and working with doing community stuff, they weren't parroting back some notion of 'You're too Harvard,' or 'You're too Hyde Park,' or what have you,\" Obama told me. \"They'd say, 'You're a wonderful young man, you're going to do great things. You just have to be patient.' So I didn't feel the loss as a rejection by black people. I felt the loss as 'politics anywhere is tough.' Politics in Chicago is especially tough. And being able to break through in the African American community is difficult because of the enormous loyalty that people feel towards anybody who has been around awhile.\"\n\nThere was no one around to compete for loyalty when Obama ran for Senate in 2004, or for president in 2008. He was no longer competing against other African Americans; he was representing them. \"He had that hybridity which told the 'do-gooders'-in Chicago they call the reformers the do-gooders-that he was acceptable,\" Muwakkil told me.\n\nObama ran for the Senate two decades after the death of Harold Washington. Axelrod checked in on the precinct where Washington had been so loudly booed by white Chicagoans. \"Obama carried, against seven candidates for the Senate, almost the entire northwest side and that precinct,\" he said. \"And I told him, 'Harold's smiling down on us tonight.' \"\n\nObama believes that his statewide victory for the Illinois Senate seat held particular portent for the events of 2008. \"Illinois is the most demographically representative state in the country,\" he told me. \"If you took all the percentages of black, white, Latino; rural, urban; agricultural, manufacturing-[if] you took that cross section across the country and you shrank it, it would be Illinois.\"\n\nIllinois effectively allowed Obama to play a scrimmage before the big national game in 2008. \"When I ran for the Senate I had to go into southern Illinois, downstate Illinois, farming communities-some with very tough racial histories, some areas where there just were no African Americans of any number,\" Obama told me. \"And when we won that race, not just an African American from Chicago, but an African American with an exotic history and [the] name Barack Hussein Obama, [it showed that I] could connect with and appeal to a much broader audience.\"\n\nThe mix of Obama's \"hybridity\" and the changing times allowed him to extend his appeal beyond the white ethnic corners of Chicago, past the downstate portions of Illinois, and out into the country at large. \"Ben Nelson, one of the most conservative Democrats in the Senate, from Nebraska, would only bring in one national Democrat to campaign for him,\" Obama recalls. \"And it was me. And so part of the reason I was willing to run [for president in 2008] was that I had had two years in which we were generating enormous crowds all across the country-and the majority of those crowds were not African American; and they were in pretty remote places, or unlikely places. They weren't just big cities or they weren't just liberal enclaves. So what that told me was, it was possible.\"\n\nWhat those crowds saw was a black candidate unlike any other before him. To simply point to Obama's white mother, or to his African father, or even to his rearing in Hawaii, is to miss the point. For most African Americans, white people exist either as a direct or an indirect force for bad in their lives. Biraciality is no shield against this; often it just intensifies the problem. What proved key for Barack Obama was not that he was born to a black man and a white woman, but that his white family approved of the union, and approved of the child who came from it. They did this in 1961-a time when sex between black men and white women, in large swaths of the country, was not just illegal but fraught with mortal danger. But that danger is not part of Obama's story. The first white people he ever knew, the ones who raised him, were decent in a way that very few black people of that era experienced.\n\nI asked Obama what he made of his grandparents' impressively civilized reception of his father. \"It wasn't Harry Belafonte,\" Obama said laughingly of his father. \"This was like an African African. And he was like a blue-black brother. Nilotic. And so, yeah, I will always give my grandparents credit for that. I'm not saying they were happy about it. I'm not saying that they were not, after the guy leaves, looking at each other like, 'What the heck?' But whatever misgivings they had, they never expressed to me, never spilled over into how they interacted with me.\n\n\"Now, part of it, as I say in my book, was we were in this unique environment in Hawaii where I think it was much easier. I don't know if it would have been as easy for them if they were living in Chicago at the time, because the lines just weren't as sharply drawn in Hawaii as they were on the mainland.\"\n\nObama's early positive interactions with his white family members gave him a fundamentally different outlook toward the wider world than most blacks of the 1960s had. Obama told me he rarely had \"the working assumption of discrimination, the working assumption that white people would not treat me right or give me an opportunity or judge me [other than] on the basis of merit.\" He continued, \"The kind of working assumption\" that white people would discriminate against him or treat him poorly \"is less embedded in my psyche than it is, say, with Michelle.\"\n\nIn this, the first lady is more representative of black America than her husband is. African Americans typically raise their children to protect themselves against a presumed hostility from white teachers, white police officers, white supervisors, and white co-workers. The need for that defense is, more often than not, reinforced either directly by actual encounters or indirectly by observing the vast differences between one's own experience and those across the color line. Marty Nesbitt, the president's longtime best friend, who, like Obama, had positive interactions with whites at a relatively early age, told me that when he and his wife went to buy their first car, she was insistent on buying from a black salesperson. \"I'm like, 'We've got to find a salesman,' \" Nesbitt said. \"She's like, 'No, no, no. We're waiting for the brother.' And I'm like, 'He's with a customer.' They were filling out documents and she was like, 'We're going to stay around.' And a white guy came up to us. 'Can I help you?' 'Nope.' \" Nesbitt was not out to condemn anyone with this story. He was asserting that \"the willingness of African Americans [in Chicago] to help lift each other up is powerful.\"\n\nBut that willingness to help is also a defense, produced by decades of discrimination. Obama sees race through a different lens, Kaye Wilson told me. \"It's just very different from ours,\" she explained. \"He's got buddies that are white, and they're his buddies, and they love him. And I don't think they love him just because he's the president. They love him because they're his friends from Hawaii, some from college and all.\n\n\"So I think he's got that, whereas I think growing up in the racist United States, we enter this thing with, you know, 'I'm looking at you. I'm not trusting you to be one hundred with me.' And I think he grew up in a way that he had to trust [white people]-how can you live under the roof with people and think that they don't love you? He needs that frame of reference. He needs that lens. If he didn't have it, it would be ... a Jesse Jackson, you know? Or Al Sharpton. Different lens.\"\n\nThat lens, born of literally relating to whites, allowed Obama to imagine that he could be the country's first black president. \"If I walked into a room and it's a bunch of white farmers, trade unionists, middle age-I'm not walking in thinking, Man, I've got to show them that I'm normal ,\" Obama explained. \"I walk in there, I think, with a set of assumptions: like, these people look just like my grandparents. And I see the same Jell‐O mold that my grandmother served, and they've got the same, you know, little stuff on their mantelpieces. And so I am maybe disarming them by just assuming that we're okay.\"\n\nWhat Obama was able to offer white America is something very few African Americans could-trust. The vast majority of us are, necessarily, too crippled by our defenses to ever consider such a proposition. But Obama, through a mixture of ancestral connections and distance from the poisons of Jim Crow, can credibly and sincerely trust the majority population of this country. That trust is reinforced, not contradicted, by his blackness. Obama isn't shuffling before white power (Herman Cain's \"shucky ducky\" act) or flattering white ego (O. J. Simpson's listing not being seen as black as a great accomplishment). That, too, is defensive, and deep down, I suspect, white people know it. He stands firm in his own cultural traditions and says to the country something virtually no black person can, but every president must: \"I believe you.\"\n\nJust after Columbus Day , I accompanied the president and his formidable entourage on a visit to North Carolina A&T State University, in Greensboro. Four days earlier, The Washington Post had published an old audio clip that featured Donald Trump lamenting a failed sexual conquest and exhorting the virtues of sexual assault. The next day, Trump claimed that this was \"locker room\" talk. As we flew to North Carolina, the president was in a state of bemused disbelief. He plopped down in a chair in the staff cabin of Air Force One and said, \"I've been in a lot of locker rooms. I don't think I've ever heard that one before.\" He was casual and relaxed. A feeling of cautious inevitability emanated from his staff, and why not? Every day seemed to bring a new, more shocking revelation or piece of evidence showing Trump to be unfit for the presidency: He had lost nearly $1 billion in a single year. He had likely not paid taxes in 18 years. He was running a \"university,\" for which he was under formal legal investigation. He had trampled on his own campaign's messaging by engaging in a Twitter crusade against a former beauty-pageant contestant. He had been denounced by leadership in his own party, and the trickle of prominent Republicans-both in and out of office-who had publicly repudiated him threatened to become a geyser. At this moment, the idea that a campaign so saturated in open bigotry, misogyny, chaos, and possible corruption could win a national election was ludicrous. This was America.\n\nThe president was going to North Carolina to keynote a campaign rally for Clinton, but first he was scheduled for a conversation about My Brother's Keeper, his initiative on behalf of disadvantaged youth. Announcing My Brother's Keeper-or MBK, as it's come to be called-in 2014, the president had sought to avoid giving the program a partisan valence, noting that it was \"not some big new government program.\" Instead, it would involve the government in concert with the nonprofit and business sectors to intervene in the lives of young men of color who were \"at risk.\" MBK serves as a kind of network for those elements of federal, state, and local government that might already have a presence in the lives of these young men. It is a quintessentially Obama program-conservative in scope, with impacts that are measurable.\n\n\"It comes right out of his own life,\" Broderick Johnson, the Cabinet secretary and an assistant to the president, who heads MBK, told me recently. \"I have heard him say, 'I don't want us to have a bunch of forums on race.' He reminds people, 'Yeah, we can talk about this. But what are we going to do ?' \" On this afternoon in North Carolina, what Obama did was sit with a group of young men who'd turned their lives around in part because of MBK. They told stories of being in the street, of choosing quick money over school, of their homes being shot up, and-through the help of mentoring or job programs brokered by MBK-transitioning into college or a job. Obama listened solemnly and empathetically to each of them. \"It doesn't take that much,\" he told them. \"It just takes someone laying hands on you and saying, 'Hey, man, you count.' \"\n\nWhen he asked the young men whether they had a message he should take back to policy makers in Washington, D.C., one observed that despite their best individual efforts, they still had to go back to the very same deprived neighborhoods that had been the sources of trouble for them. \"It's your environment,\" the young man said. \"You can do what you want, but you still gotta go back to the hood.\"\n\nHe was correct. The ghettos of America are the direct result of decades of public-policy decisions: the redlining of real-estate zoning maps, the expanded authority given to prosecutors, the increased funding given to prisons. And all of this was done on the backs of people still reeling from the 250-year legacy of slavery. The results of this negative investment are clear-African Americans rank at the bottom of nearly every major socioeconomic measure in the country.\n\nObama's formula for closing this chasm between black and white America, like that of many progressive politicians today, proceeded from policy designed for all of America. Blacks disproportionately benefit from this effort, since they are disproportionately in need. The Affordable Care Act, which cut the uninsured rate in the black community by at least a third, was Obama's most prominent example. Its full benefit has yet to be felt by African Americans, because several states in the South have declined to expand Medicaid. But when the president and I were meeting, the ACA's advocates believed that pressure on state budgets would force expansion, and there was evidence to support this: Louisiana had expanded Medicaid earlier in 2016, and advocates were gearing up for wars to be waged in Georgia and Virginia.\n\nObama also emphasized the need for a strong Justice Department with a deep commitment to nondiscrimination. When Obama moved into the White House in 2009, the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division \"was in shambles,\" former Attorney General Eric Holder told me recently. \"I mean, I had been there for 12 years as a line guy. I started out in '76, so I served under Republicans and Democrats. And what the [George W.] Bush administration, what the Bush DOJ did, was unlike anything that had ever happened before in terms of politicized hiring.\" The career civil servants below the political appointees, Holder said, were not even invited to the meetings in which the key hiring and policy decisions were made. After Obama's inauguration, Holder told me, \"I remember going to tell all the folks at the Civil Rights Division, 'The Civil Rights Division is open for business again.' The president gave me additional funds to hire people.\"\n\nThe political press developed a narrative that because Obama felt he had to modulate his rhetoric on race, Holder was the administration's true, and thus blacker, conscience. Holder is certainly blunter, and this worried some of the White House staff. Early in Obama's first term, Holder gave a speech on race in which he said the United States had been a \"nation of cowards\" on the subject. But positioning the two men as opposites elides an important fact: Holder was appointed by the president, and went only as far as the president allowed. I asked Holder whether he had toned down his rhetoric after that controversial speech. \"Nope,\" he said. Reflecting on his relationship with the president, Holder said, \"We were also kind of different people, you know? He is the Zen guy. And I'm kind of the hot-blooded West Indian. And I thought we made a good team, but there's nothing that I ever did or said that I don't think he would have said, 'I support him 100 percent.'\n\n\"Now, the 'nation of cowards' speech, the president might have used a different phrase-maybe, probably. But he and I share a worldview, you know? And when I hear people say, 'Well, you are blacker than him' or something like that, I think, What are you all talking about? \"\n\nFor much of his presidency, a standard portion of Obama's speeches about race riffed on black people's need to turn off the television, stop eating junk food, and stop blaming white people for their problems. Obama would deliver this lecture to any black audience, regardless of context. It was bizarre, for instance, to see the president warning young men who'd just graduated from Morehouse College, one of the most storied black colleges in the country, about making \"excuses\" and blaming whites.\n\nThis part of the Obama formula is the most troubling, and least thought-out. This judgment emerges from my own biography. I am the product of black parents who encouraged me to read, of black teachers who felt my work ethic did not match my potential, of black college professors who taught me intellectual rigor. And they did this in a world that every day insulted their humanity. It was not so much that the black layabouts and deadbeats Obama invoked in his speeches were unrecognizable. I had seen those people too. But I'd also seen the same among white people. If black men were overrepresented among drug dealers and absentee dads of the world, it was directly related to their being underrepresented among the Bernie Madoffs and Kenneth Lays of the world. Power was what mattered, and what characterized the differences between black and white America was not a difference in work ethic, but a system engineered to place one on top of the other.\n\nThe mark of that system is visible at every level of American society, regardless of the quality of one's choices. For instance, the unemployment rate among black college graduates (4.1 percent) is almost the same as the unemployment rate among white high-school graduates (4.6 percent). But that college degree is generally purchased at a higher price by blacks than by whites. According to research by the Brookings Institution, African Americans tend to carry more student debt four years after graduation ($53,000 versus $28,000) and suffer from a higher default rate on their loans (7.6 percent versus 2.4 percent) than white Americans. This is both the result and the perpetuator of a sprawling wealth gap between the races. White households, on average, hold seven times as much wealth as black households-a difference so large as to make comparing the \"black middle class\" and \"white middle class\" meaningless; they're simply not comparable. According to Patrick Sharkey, a sociologist at New York University who studies economic mobility, black families making $100,000 a year or more live in more-disadvantaged neighborhoods than white families making less than $30,000. This gap didn't just appear by magic; it's the result of the government's effort over many decades to create a pigmentocracy-one that will continue without explicit intervention.\n\nObama had been on the record as opposing reparations. But now, late in his presidency, he seemed more open to the idea-in theory, at least, if not in practice.\n\n\"Theoretically, you can make obviously a powerful argument that centuries of slavery, Jim Crow, discrimination are the primary cause for all those gaps,\" Obama said, referencing the gulf in education, wealth, and employment that separates black and white America. \"That those were wrongs to the black community as a whole, and black families specifically, and that in order to close that gap, a society has a moral obligation to make a large, aggressive investment, even if it's not in the form of individual reparations checks but in the form of a Marshall Plan.\"\n\nThe political problems with turning the argument for reparations into reality are manifold, Obama said. \"If you look at countries like South Africa, where you had a black majority, there have been efforts to tax and help that black majority, but it hasn't come in the form of a formal reparations program. You have countries like India that have tried to help untouchables, with essentially affirmative-action programs, but it hasn't fundamentally changed the structure of their societies. So the bottom line is that it's hard to find a model in which you can practically administer and sustain political support for those kinds of efforts.\"\n\nObama went on to say that it would be better, and more realistic, to get the country to rally behind a robust liberal agenda and build on the enormous progress that's been made toward getting white Americans to accept nondiscrimination as a basic operating premise. But the progress toward nondiscrimination did not appear overnight. It was achieved by people willing to make an unpopular argument and live on the frontier of public opinion. I asked him whether it wasn't-despite the practical obstacles-worth arguing that the state has a collective responsibility not only for its achievements but for its sins.\n\n\"I want my children-I want Malia and Sasha-to understand that they've got responsibilities beyond just what they themselves have done,\" Obama said. \"That they have a responsibility to the larger community and the larger nation, that they should be sensitive to and extra thoughtful about the plight of people who have been oppressed in the past, are oppressed currently. So that's a wisdom that I want to transmit to my kids ... But I would say that's a high level of enlightenment that you're looking to have from a majority of the society. And it may be something that future generations are more open to, but I am pretty confident that for the foreseeable future, using the argument of nondiscrimination, and 'Let's get it right for the kids who are here right now,' and giving them the best chance possible, is going to be a more persuasive argument.\"\n\nObama is unfailingly optimistic about the empathy and capabilities of the American people. His job necessitates this: \"At some level what the people want to feel is that the person leading them sees the best in them,\" he told me. But I found it interesting that that optimism does not extend to the possibility of the public's accepting wisdoms-such as the moral logic of reparations-that the president, by his own account, has accepted for himself and is willing to teach his children. Obama says he always tells his staff that \"better is good.\" The notion that a president would attempt to achieve change within the boundaries of the accepted consensus is appropriate. But Obama is almost constitutionally skeptical of those who seek to achieve change outside that consensus.\n\nEarly in 2016, Obama invited a group of African American leaders to meet with him at the White House. When some of the activists affiliated with Black Lives Matter refused to attend, Obama began calling them out in speeches. \"You can't refuse to meet because that might compromise the purity of your position,\" he said. \"The value of social movements and activism is to get you at the table, get you in the room, and then start trying to figure out how is this problem going to be solved. You then have a responsibility to prepare an agenda that is achievable-that can institutionalize the changes you seek-and to engage the other side.\"\n\nOpal Tometi, a Nigerian American community activist who is one of the three founders of Black Lives Matter, explained to me that the group has a more diffuse structure than most civil-rights organizations. One reason for this is to avoid the cult of personality that has plagued black organizations in the past. So the founders asked its membership in Chicago, the president's hometown, whether they should meet with Obama. \"They felt-and I think many of our members felt-there wouldn't be the depth of discussion that they wanted to have,\" Tometi told me. \"And if there wasn't that space to have a real heart-to-heart, and if it was just surface level, that it would be more of a disservice to the movement.\"\n\nTometi noted that some other activists allied with Black Lives Matter had been planning to attend the meeting, so they felt their views would be represented. Nevertheless, Black Lives Matter sees itself as engaged in a protest against the treatment of black people by the American state, and so Tometi and much of the group's leadership, concerned about being used for a photo op by the very body they were protesting, opted not to go.\n\nWhen I asked Obama about this perspective, he fluctuated between understanding where the activists were coming from and being hurt by such brush-offs. \"I think that where I've gotten frustrated during the course of my presidency has never been because I was getting pushed too hard by activists to see the justness of a cause or the essence of an issue,\" he said. \"I think where I got frustrated at times was the belief that the president can do anything if he just decides he wants to do it. And that sort of lack of awareness on the part of an activist about the constraints of our political system and the constraints on this office, I think, sometimes would leave me to mutter under my breath. Very rarely did I lose it publicly. Usually I'd just smile.\"\n\nHe laughed, then continued, \"The reason I say that is because those are the times where sometimes you feel actually a little bit hurt. Because you feel like saying to these folks, '[Don't] you think if I could do it, I [would] have just done it? Do you think that the only problem is that I don't care enough about the plight of poor people, or gay people?' \"\n\nI asked Obama whether he thought that perhaps protesters' distrust of the powers that be could ultimately be healthy. \"Yes,\" he said. \"Which is why I don't get too hurt. I mean, I think there is a benefit to wanting to hold power's feet to the fire until you actually see the goods. I get that. And I think it is important. And frankly, sometimes it's useful for activists just to be out there to keep you mindful and not get complacent, even if ultimately you think some of their criticism is misguided.\"\n\nObama himself was an activist and a community organizer, albeit for only two years-but he is not, by temperament, a protester. He is a consensus-builder; consensus, he believes, ultimately drives what gets done. He understands the emotional power of protest, the need to vent before authority-but that kind of approach does not come naturally to him. Regarding reparations, he said, \"Sometimes I wonder how much of these debates have to do with the desire, the legitimate desire, for that history to be recognized. Because there is a psychic power to the recognition that is not satisfied with a universal program; it's not satisfied by the Affordable Care Act, or an expansion of Pell Grants, or an expansion of the earned-income tax credit.\" These kinds of programs, effective and disproportionately beneficial to black people though they may be, don't \"speak to the hurt, and the sense of injustice, and the self-doubt that arises out of the fact that [African Americans] are behind now, and it makes us sometimes feel as if there must be something wrong with us-unless you're able to see the history and say, 'It's amazing we got this far given what we went through.'\n\n\"So in part, I think the argument sometimes that I've had with folks who are much more interested in sort of race-specific programs is less an argument about what is practically achievable and sometimes maybe more an argument of 'We want society to see what's happened and internalize it and answer it in demonstrable ways.' And those impulses I very much understand-but my hope would be that as we're moving through the world right now, we're able to get that psychological or emotional peace by seeing very concretely our kids doing better and being more hopeful and having greater opportunities.\"\n\nObama saw-at least at that moment, before the election of Donald Trump-a straight path to that world. \"Just play this out as a thought experiment,\" he said. \"Imagine if you had genuine, high-quality early-childhood education for every child, and suddenly every black child in America-but also every poor white child or Latino [child], but just stick with every black child in America-is getting a really good education. And they're graduating from high school at the same rates that whites are, and they are going to college at the same rates that whites are, and they are able to afford college at the same rates because the government has universal programs that say that you're not going to be barred from school just because of how much money your parents have.\n\n\"So now they're all graduating. And let's also say that the Justice Department and the courts are making sure, as I've said in a speech before, that when Jamal sends his résumé in, he's getting treated the same as when Johnny sends his résumé in. Now, are we going to have suddenly the same number of CEOs, billionaires, etc., as the white community? In 10 years? Probably not, maybe not even in 20 years.\n\n\"But I guarantee you that we would be thriving, we would be succeeding. We wouldn't have huge numbers of young African American men in jail. We'd have more family formation as college-graduated girls are meeting boys who are their peers, which then in turn means the next generation of kids are growing up that much better. And suddenly you've got a whole generation that's in a position to start using the incredible creativity that we see in music, and sports, and frankly even on the streets, channeled into starting all kinds of businesses. I feel pretty good about our odds in that situation.\"\n\nThe thought experiment doesn't hold up. The programs Obama favored would advance white America too-and without a specific commitment to equality, there is no guarantee that the programs would eschew discrimination. Obama's solution relies on a goodwill that his own personal history tells him exists in the larger country. My own history tells me something different. The large numbers of black men in jail, for instance, are not just the result of poor policy, but of not seeing those men as human.\n\nWhen President Obama and I had this conversation, the target he was aiming to reach seemed to me to be many generations away, and now-as President-Elect Trump prepares for office-seems even many more generations off. Obama's accomplishments were real: a $1 billion settlement on behalf of black farmers, a Justice Department that exposed Ferguson's municipal plunder, the increased availability of Pell Grants (and their availability to some prisoners), and the slashing of the crack/cocaine disparity in sentencing guidelines, to name just a few. Obama was also the first sitting president to visit a federal prison. There was a feeling that he'd erected a foundation upon which further progressive policy could be built. It's tempting to say that foundation is now endangered. The truth is, it was never safe.\n\nObama's greatest misstep was born directly out of his greatest insight. Only Obama, a black man who emerged from the best of white America, and thus could sincerely trust white America, could be so certain that he could achieve broad national appeal. And yet only a black man with that same biography could underestimate his opposition's resolve to destroy him. In some sense an Obama presidency could never have succeeded along the normal presidential lines; he needed a partner, or partners, in Congress who could put governance above party. But he struggled to win over even some of his own allies. Ben Nelson, the Democratic senator from Nebraska whom Obama helped elect, became an obstacle to health-care reform. Joe Lieberman, whom Obama saved from retribution at the hands of Senate Democrats after Lieberman campaigned for Obama's 2008 opponent, John McCain, similarly obstructed Obamacare. Among Republicans, senators who had seemed amenable to Obama's agenda-Chuck Grassley, Susan Collins, Richard Lugar, Olympia Snowe-rebuffed him repeatedly.\n\nThe obstruction grew out of narrow political incentives. \"If Republicans didn't cooperate,\" Obama told me, \"and there was not a portrait of bipartisan cooperation and a functional federal government, then the party in power would pay the price and they could win back the Senate and/or the House. That wasn't an inaccurate political calculation.\"\n\nObama is not sure of the degree to which individual racism played into this calculation. \"I do remember watching Bill Clinton get impeached and Hillary Clinton being accused of killing Vince Foster,\" he said. \"And if you ask them, I'm sure they would say, 'No, actually what you're experiencing is not because you're black, it's because you're a Democrat.' \"\n\nBut personal animus is just one manifestation of racism; arguably the more profound animosity occurs at the level of interests. The most recent Congress boasted 138 members from the states that comprised the old Confederacy. Of the 101 Republicans in that group, 96 are white and one is black. Of the 37 Democrats, 18 are black and 15 are white. There are no white congressional Democrats in the Deep South. Exit polls in Mississippi in 2008 found that 96 percent of voters who described themselves as Republicans were white. The Republican Party is not simply the party of whites, but the preferred party of whites who identify their interest as defending the historical privileges of whiteness. The researchers Josh Pasek, Jon A. Krosnick, and Trevor Tompson found that in 2012, 32 percent of Democrats held antiblack views, while 79 percent of Republicans did. These attitudes could even spill over to white Democratic politicians, because they are seen as representing the party of blacks. Studying the 2016 election, the political scientist Philip Klinkner found that the most predictive question for understanding whether a voter favored Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump was \"Is Barack Obama a Muslim?\"\n\nIn our conversations, Obama said he didn't doubt that there was a sincerely nonracist states'-rights contingent of the GOP. And yet he suspected that there might be more to it. \"A rudimentary knowledge of American history tells you that the relationship between the federal government and the states was very much mixed up with attitudes towards slavery, attitudes towards Jim Crow, attitudes towards antipoverty programs and who benefited and who didn't,\" he said.\n\n\"And so I'm careful not to attribute any particular resistance or slight or opposition to race. But what I do believe is that if somebody didn't have a problem with their daddy being employed by the federal government, and didn't have a problem with the Tennessee Valley Authority electrifying certain communities, and didn't have a problem with the interstate highway system being built, and didn't have a problem with the GI Bill, and didn't have a problem with the [Federal Housing Administration] subsidizing the suburbanization of America, and that all helped you build wealth and create a middle class-and then suddenly as soon as African Americans or Latinos are interested in availing themselves of those same mechanisms as ladders into the middle class, you now have a violent opposition to them-then I think you at least have to ask yourself the question of how consistent you are, and what's different, and what's changed.\"\n\nRacism greeted Obama in both his primary and general-election campaigns in 2008. Photos were circulated of him in Somali garb. Rush Limbaugh dubbed him \"Barack the Magic Negro.\" Roger Stone, who would go on to advise the Trump campaign, claimed that Michelle Obama could be heard on tape yelling \"Whitey.\" Detractors circulated emails claiming that the future first lady had written a racist senior thesis while at Princeton. A fifth of all West Virginia Democratic-primary voters in 2008 openly admitted that race had influenced their vote. Hillary Clinton trounced him 67 to 26 percent.\n\nAfter Obama won the presidency in defiance of these racial headwinds, traffic to the white-supremacist website Stormfront increased sixfold. Before the election, in August, just before the Democratic National Convention, the FBI uncovered an assassination plot hatched by white supremacists in Denver. Mainstream conservative publications floated the notion that Obama's memoir was too \"stylish and penetrating\" to have been written by the candidate, and found a plausible ghostwriter in the radical (and white) former Weatherman Bill Ayers. A Republican women's club in California dispensed \"Obama Bucks\" featuring slices of watermelon, ribs, and fried chicken. At the Values Voter Summit that year, conventioneers hawked \"Obama Waffles,\" a waffle mix whose box featured a bug-eyed caricature of the candidate. Fake hip-hop lyrics were scrawled on the side (\"Barry's Bling Bling Waffle Ring\") and on the top, the same caricature was granted a turban and tagged with the instructions \"Point box toward Mecca for tastier waffles.\" The display was denounced by the summit's sponsor, the Family Research Council. One would be forgiven for meeting this denunciation with guffaws: The council's president, Tony Perkins, had once addressed the white-supremacist Council of Conservative Citizens with a Confederate flag draped behind him. By 2015, Perkins had deemed the debate over Obama's birth certificate \"legitimate\" and was saying that it \"makes sense\" to conclude that Obama was actually a Muslim.\n\nBy then, birtherism-inflamed in large part by a real-estate mogul and reality-TV star named Donald Trump-had overtaken the Republican rank and file. In 2015, one poll found that 54 percent of GOP voters thought Obama was a Muslim. Only 29 percent believed he'd been born in America.\n\nStill, in 2008, Obama had been elected. His supporters rejoiced. As Jay-Z commemorated the occasion:\n\nNot quite. A month after Obama entered the White House, a CNBC personality named Rick Santelli took to the trading floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and denounced the president's efforts to help homeowners endangered by the housing crisis. \"How many of you people want to pay for your neighbor's mortgage that has an extra bathroom and can't pay their bills?,\" Santelli asked the assembled traders. He asserted that Obama should \"reward people that could carry the water\" as opposed to those who \"drink the water,\" and denounced those in danger of foreclosure as \"losers.\" Race was implicit in Santelli's harangue-the housing crisis and predatory lending had devastated black communities and expanded the wealth gap-and it culminated with a call for a \"Tea Party\" to resist the Obama presidency. In fact, right-wing ideologues had been planning just such a resistance for decades. They would eagerly answer Santelli's call.\n\nOne of the intellectual forerunners of the Tea Party is said to be Ron Paul, the heterodox two-time Republican presidential candidate, who opposed the war in Iraq and championed civil liberties. On other matters, Paul was more traditional. Throughout the '90s, he published a series of racist newsletters that referred to New York City as \"Welfaria,\" called Martin Luther King Jr. Day \"Hate Whitey Day,\" and asserted that 95 percent of black males in Washington, D.C., were either \"semi-criminal or entirely criminal.\" Paul's apologists have claimed that he had no real connection to the newsletters, even though virtually all of them were published in his name (\"The Ron Paul Survival Report,\" \"Ron Paul Political Report,\" \"Dr. Ron Paul's Freedom Report\") and written in his voice. Either way, the views of the newsletters have found their expression in his ideological comrades. Throughout Obama's first term, Tea Party activists voiced their complaints in racist terms. Activists brandished signs warning that Obama would implement \"white slavery,\" waved the Confederate flag, depicted Obama as a witch doctor, and issued calls for him to \"go back to Kenya.\" Tea Party supporters wrote \"satirical\" letters in the name of \"We Colored People\" and stoked the flames of birtherism. One of the Tea Party's most prominent sympathizers, the radio host Laura Ingraham, wrote a racist tract depicting Michelle Obama gorging herself on ribs, while Glenn Beck said the president was a \"racist\" with a \"deep-seated hatred for white people.\" The Tea Party's leading exponent, Andrew Breitbart, engineered the smearing of Shirley Sherrod, the U.S. Department of Agriculture's director of rural development for Georgia, publishing egregiously misleading videos that wrongly made her appear to be engaging in antiwhite racist invective, which led to her dismissal. (In a rare act of cowardice, the Obama administration cravenly submitted to this effort.)\n\nIn those rare moments when Obama made any sort of comment attacking racism, firestorms threatened to consume his governing agenda. When, in July 2009, the president objected to the arrest of the eminent Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. while he was trying to get into his own house, pointing out that the officer had \"acted stupidly,\" a third of whites said the remark made them feel less favorably toward the president, and nearly two-thirds claimed that Obama had \"acted stupidly\" by commenting. A chastened Obama then determined to make sure his public statements on race were no longer mere riffs but designed to have an achievable effect. This was smart, but still the invective came. During Obama's 2009 address on health care before a joint session of Congress, Joe Wilson, a Republican congressman from South Carolina, incredibly, and in defiance of precedent and decorum, disrupted the proceedings by crying out \"You lie!\" A Missouri congressman equated Obama with a monkey. A California GOP official took up the theme and emailed her friends an image depicting Obama as a chimp, with the accompanying text explaining, \"Now you know why [there's] no birth certificate!\" Former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin assessed the president's foreign policy as a \"shuck and jive shtick.\" Newt Gingrich dubbed him the \"food-stamp president.\" The rhetorical attacks on Obama were matched by a very real attack on his political base-in 2011 and 2012, 19 states enacted voting restrictions that made it harder for African Americans to vote.\n\nYet in 2012, as in 2008, Obama won anyway. Prior to the election, Obama, ever the optimist, had claimed that intransigent Republicans would decide to work with him to advance the country. No such collaboration was in the offing. Instead, legislation ground to a halt and familiar themes resurfaced. An Idaho GOP official posted a photo on Facebook depicting a trap waiting for Obama. The bait was a slice of watermelon. The caption read, \"Breaking: The secret service just uncovered a plot to kidnap the president. More details as we get them ...\" In 2014, conservatives assembled in support of Cliven Bundy's armed protest against federal grazing fees. As reporters descended on the Bundy ranch in Nevada, Bundy offered his opinions on \"the Negro.\" \"They abort their young children, they put their young men in jail, because they never learned how to pick cotton,\" Bundy explained. \"And I've often wondered, are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government subsidy? They didn't get no more freedom. They got less freedom.\"\n\nThat same year, in the wake of Michael Brown's death, the Justice Department opened an investigation into the police department in Ferguson, Missouri. It found a city that, through racial profiling, arbitrary fines, and wanton harassment, had exploited law enforcement for the purposes of municipal plunder. The plunder was sanctified by racist humor dispensed via internal emails among the police that later came to light. The president of the United States, who during his first year in office had reportedly received three times the number of death threats of any of his predecessors, was a repeat target.\n\nMuch ink has been spilled in an attempt to understand the Tea Party protests, and the 2016 presidential candidacy of Donald Trump, which ultimately emerged out of them. One theory popular among (primarily) white intellectuals of varying political persuasions held that this response was largely the discontented rumblings of a white working class threatened by the menace of globalization and crony capitalism. Dismissing these rumblings as racism was said to condescend to this proletariat, which had long suffered the slings and arrows of coastal elites, heartless technocrats, and reformist snobs. Racism was not something to be coolly and empirically assessed but a slander upon the working man. Deindustrialization, globalization, and broad income inequality are real. And they have landed with at least as great a force upon black and Latino people in our country as upon white people. And yet these groups were strangely unrepresented in this new populism.\n\nChristopher S. Parker and Matt A. Barreto, political scientists at the University of Washington and UCLA, respectively, have found a relatively strong relationship between racism and Tea Party membership. \"Whites are less likely to be drawn to the Tea Party for material reasons, suggesting that, relative to other groups, it's really more about social prestige,\" they say. The notion that the Tea Party represented the righteous, if unfocused, anger of an aggrieved class allowed everyone from leftists to neoliberals to white nationalists to avoid a horrifying and simple reality: A significant swath of this country did not like the fact that their president was black, and that swath was not composed of those most damaged by an unquestioned faith in the markets. Far better to imagine the grievance put upon the president as the ghost of shambling factories and defunct union halls, as opposed to what it really was-a movement inaugurated by ardent and frightened white capitalists, raging from the commodities-trading floor of one of the great financial centers of the world.\n\nThat movement came into full bloom in the summer of 2015, with the candidacy of Donald Trump, a man who'd risen to political prominence by peddling the racist myth that the president was not American. It was birtherism-not trade, not jobs, not isolationism-that launched Trump's foray into electoral politics. Having risen unexpectedly on this basis into the stratosphere of Republican politics, Trump spent the campaign freely and liberally trafficking in misogyny, Islamophobia, and xenophobia. And on November 8, 2016, he won election to the presidency. Historians will spend the next century analyzing how a country with such allegedly grand democratic traditions was, so swiftly and so easily, brought to the brink of fascism. But one needn't stretch too far to conclude that an eight-year campaign of consistent and open racism aimed at the leader of the free world helped clear the way.\n\n\"They rode the tiger. And now the tiger is eating them,\" David Axelrod, speaking of the Republican Party, told me. That was in October. His words proved too optimistic. The tiger would devour us all.\n\nOne Saturday morning last May, I joined the presidential motorcade as it slipped out of the southern gate of the White House. A mostly white crowd had assembled. As the motorcade drove by, people cheered, held up their smartphones to record the procession, and waved American flags. To be within feet of the president seemed like the thrill of their lives. I was astounded. An old euphoria, which I could not immediately place, gathered up in me. And then I remembered, it was what I felt through much of 2008, as I watched Barack Obama's star shoot across the political sky. I had never seen so many white people cheer on a black man who was neither an athlete nor an entertainer. And it seemed that they loved him for this, and I thought in those days, which now feel so long ago, that they might then love me, too, and love my wife, and love my child, and love us all in the manner that the God they so fervently cited had commanded. I had been raised amid a people who wanted badly to believe in the possibility of a Barack Obama, even as their very lives argued against that possibility. So they would praise Martin Luther King Jr. in one breath and curse the white man, \"the Great Deceiver,\" in the next. Then came Obama and the Obama family, and they were black and beautiful in all the ways we aspired to be, and all that love was showered upon them. But as Obama's motorcade approached its destination-Howard University, where he would give the commencement address-the complexion of the crowd darkened, and I understood that the love was specific, that even if it allowed Barack Obama, even if it allowed the luckiest of us, to defy the boundaries, then the masses of us, in cities like this one, would still enjoy no such feat.\n\nThese were our fitful, spasmodic years.\n\nWe were launched into the Obama era with no notion of what to expect, if only because a black presidency had seemed such a dubious proposition. There was no preparation, because it would have meant preparing for the impossible. There were few assessments of its potential import, because such assessments were regarded as speculative fiction. In retrospect it all makes sense, and one can see a jagged but real political lineage running through black Chicago. It originates in Oscar Stanton De Priest; continues through Congressman William Dawson, who, under Roosevelt, switched from the Republican to the Democratic Party; crescendos with the legendary Harold Washington; rises still with Jesse Jackson's 1988 victory in Michigan's Democratic caucuses; rises again with Carol Moseley Braun's triumph; and reaches its recent apex with the election of Barack Obama. If the lineage is apparent in hindsight, so are the limits of presidential power. For a century after emancipation, quasi-slavery haunted the South. And more than half a century after Brown v. Board of Education , schools throughout much of this country remain segregated.\n\nThere are no clean victories for black people, nor, perhaps, for any people. The presidency of Barack Obama is no different. One can now say that an African American individual can rise to the same level as a white individual, and yet also say that the number of black individuals who actually qualify for that status will be small. One thinks of Serena Williams, whose dominance and stunning achievements can't, in and of themselves, ensure equal access to tennis facilities for young black girls. The gate is open and yet so very far away.\n\nI felt a mix of pride and amazement walking onto Howard's campus that day. Howard alumni, of which I am one, are an obnoxious fraternity, known for yelling the school chant across city blocks, sneering at other historically black colleges and universities, and condescending to black graduates of predominantly white institutions. I like to think I am more reserved, but I felt an immense satisfaction in being in the library where I had once found my history, and now found myself with the first black president of the United States. It seemed providential that he would give the commencement address here in his last year. The same pride I felt radiated out across the Yard, the large green patch in the main area of the campus where the ceremony would take place. When Obama walked out, the audience exploded, and when the time came for the color guard to present arms, a chant arose: \"O-Ba-Ma! O-Ba-Ma! O-Ba-Ma!\"\n\nHe gave a good speech that day, paying heed to Howard's rituals, calling out its famous alumni, shouting out the university's various dormitories, and urging young people to vote. (His usual riff on respectability politics was missing.) But I think he could have stood before that crowd, smiled, and said \"Good luck,\" and they would have loved him anyway. He was their champion, and this was evident in the smallest of things. The national anthem was played first, but then came the black national anthem, \"Lift Every Voice and Sing.\" As the lyrics rang out over the crowd, the students held up the black-power fist-a symbol of defiance before power. And yet here, in the face of a black man in his last year in power, it scanned not as a protest, but as a salute.\n\nSix months later the awful price of a black presidency would be known to those students, even as the country seemed determined not to acknowledge it. In the days after Donald Trump's victory, there would be an insistence that something as \"simple\" as racism could not explain it. As if enslavement had nothing to do with global economics, or as if lynchings said nothing about the idea of women as property. As though the past 400 years could be reduced to the irrational resentment of full lips. No. Racism is never simple. And there was nothing simple about what was coming, or about Obama, the man who had unwittingly summoned this future into being.\n\nIt was said that the Americans who'd supported Trump were victims of liberal condescension. The word racist would be dismissed as a profane slur put upon the common man, as opposed to an accurate description of actual men. \"We simply don't yet know how much racism or misogyny motivated Trump voters,\" David Brooks would write in The New York Times . \"If you were stuck in a jobless town, watching your friends OD on opiates, scrambling every month to pay the electric bill, and then along came a guy who seemed able to fix your problems and hear your voice, maybe you would stomach some ugliness, too.\" This strikes me as perfectly logical. Indeed, it could apply just as well to Louis Farrakhan's appeal to the black poor and working class. But whereas the followers of an Islamophobic white nationalist enjoy the sympathy that must always greet the salt of the earth, the followers of an anti-Semitic black nationalist endure the scorn that must ever greet the children of the enslaved.\n\nMuch would be made of blue-collar voters in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan who'd pulled the lever for Obama in 2008 and 2012 and then for Trump in 2016. Surely these voters disproved racism as an explanatory force. It's still not clear how many individual voters actually flipped. But the underlying presumption-that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama could be swapped in for each other-exhibited a problem. Clinton was a candidate who'd won one competitive political race in her life, whose political instincts were questioned by her own advisers, who took more than half a million dollars in speaking fees from an investment bank because it was \"what they offered,\" who proposed to bring back to the White House a former president dogged by allegations of rape and sexual harassment. Obama was a candidate who'd become only the third black senator in the modern era; who'd twice been elected president, each time flipping red and purple states; who'd run one of the most scandal-free administrations in recent memory. Imagine an African American facsimile of Hillary Clinton: She would never be the nominee of a major political party and likely would not be in national politics at all.\n\nPointing to citizens who voted for both Obama and Trump does not disprove racism; it evinces it. To secure the White House, Obama needed to be a Harvard-trained lawyer with a decade of political experience and an incredible gift for speaking to cross sections of the country; Donald Trump needed only money and white bluster.\n\nIn the week after the election, I was a mess. I had not seen my wife in two weeks. I was on deadline for this article. My son was struggling in school. The house was in disarray. I played Marvin Gaye endlessly-\"When you left, you took all of me with you.\" Friends began to darkly recall the ghosts of post-Reconstruction. The election of Donald Trump confirmed everything I knew of my country and none of what I could accept. The idea that America would follow its first black president with Donald Trump accorded with its history. I was shocked at my own shock. I had wanted Obama to be right.\n\nI still want Obama to be right. I still would like to fold myself into the dream. This will not be possible.\n\nBy some cosmic coincidence, a week after the election I received a portion of my father's FBI file I was made aware of the FBI file by the diligent work of researchers from the show Finding Your Roots . I was taping an episode on my family the day of my last interview with the president. . My father had grown up poor in Philadelphia. His father was struck dead on the street. His grandfather was crushed to death in a meatpacking plant. He'd served his country in Vietnam, gotten radicalized there, and joined the Black Panther Party, which brought him to the attention of J. Edgar Hoover. A memo written to the FBI director was \"submitted aimed at discrediting WILLIAM PAUL COATES, Acting Captain of the BPP, Baltimore.\" The memo proposed that a fake letter be sent to the Panthers' co-founder Huey P. Newton. The fake letter accused my father of being an informant and concluded, \"I want somethin done with this bootlikin facist pig nigger and I want it done now.\" The words somethin done need little interpretation. The Panthers were eventually consumed by an internecine war instigated by the FBI, one in which being labeled a police informant was a death sentence.\n\nA few hours after I saw this file, I had my last conversation with the president. I asked him how his optimism was holding up, given Trump's victory. He confessed to being surprised at the outcome but said that it was tough to \"draw a grand theory from it, because there were some very unusual circumstances.\" He pointed to both candidates' high negatives, the media coverage, and a \"dispirited\" electorate. But he said that his general optimism about the shape of American history remained unchanged. \"To be optimistic about the long-term trends of the United States doesn't mean that everything is going to go in a smooth, direct, straight line,\" he said. \"It goes forward sometimes, sometimes it goes back, sometimes it goes sideways, sometimes it zigs and zags.\"\n\nI thought of Hoover's FBI, which harassed three generations of black activists, from Marcus Garvey's black nationalists to Martin Luther King Jr.'s integrationists to Huey Newton's Black Panthers, including my father. And I thought of the enormous power accrued to the presidency in the post-9/11 era-the power to obtain American citizens' phone records en masse, to access their emails, to detain them indefinitely. I asked the president whether it was all worth it. Whether this generation of black activists and their allies should be afraid.\n\n\"Keep in mind that the capacity of the NSA, or other surveillance tools, are specifically prohibited from being applied to U.S. citizens or U.S. persons without specific evidence of links to terrorist activity or, you know, other foreign-related activity,\" he said. \"So, you know, I think this whole story line that somehow Big Brother has massively expanded and now that a new president is in place it's this loaded gun ready to be used on domestic dissent is just not accurate.\"\n\nHe counseled vigilance, \"because the possibility of abuse by government officials always exists. The issue is not going to be that there are new tools available; the issue is making sure that the incoming administration, like my administration, takes the constraints on how we deal with U.S. citizens and persons seriously.\" This answer did not fill me with confidence. The next day, President-Elect Trump offered Lieutenant General Michael Flynn the post of national-security adviser and picked Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama as his nominee for attorney general. Last February, Flynn tweeted, \"Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL\" and linked to a YouTube video that declared followers of Islam want \"80 percent of humanity enslaved or exterminated.\" Sessions had once been accused of calling a black lawyer \"boy,\" claiming that a white lawyer who represented black clients was a disgrace to his race, and joking that he thought the Ku Klux Klan \"was okay until I found out they smoked pot.\" I felt then that I knew what was coming-more Freddie Grays, more Rekia Boyds, more informants and undercover officers sent to infiltrate mosques.\n\nAnd I also knew that the man who could not countenance such a thing in his America had been responsible for the only time in my life when I felt, as the first lady had once said, proud of my country, and I knew that it was his very lack of countenance, his incredible faith, his improbable trust in his countrymen, that had made that feeling possible. The feeling was that little black boy touching the president's hair. It was watching Obama on the campaign trail, always expecting the worst and amazed that the worst never happened. It was how I'd felt seeing Barack and Michelle during the inauguration, the car slow-dragging down Pennsylvania Avenue, the crowd cheering, and then the two of them rising up out of the limo, rising up from fear, smiling, waving, defying despair, defying history, defying gravity.\n\nTheAtlantic.com Copyright (c) 2025 by The Atlantic Monthly Group.

      "text": "Beyoncé's Black-Intellectual Homecoming\n\nThe performer's new Netflix documentary, which details her landmark 2018 Coachella performance, is as much a celebration of African American scholarly history as it is a concert film.\n\nThe first words in Homecoming , the new Netflix documentary that expands on Beyoncé's landmark 2018 Coachella performance , come not from the singer, but from the author Toni Morrison. \"If you surrender to the air, you can ride it,\" the title card reads, a slightly modified quote from Morrison's 1977 novel, Song of Solomon .\n\nAfter about 15 minutes of performance footage capped by the Lemonade surprise single \"Formation,\" the documentary shifts to a glimpse into the process of pulling the Coachella performance together. The first thing that viewers hear after the final echoes of \"Formation\" is the voice of the late Nina Simone , played over recordings from some of Beyoncé's Coachella rehearsals, which spanned eight months: *\n\nI think what you're trying to ask is why am I so insistent upon giving out to them that blackness, that black power, that black-pushing them to identify with black culture, I think that's what you're asking. I have no choice over it in the first place. To me we are the most beautiful creatures in the whole world-black people. My job is to somehow make them curious enough, persuade them by hook or crook, to get more aware of themselves and where they came from and what they are into and what is already there, just to bring it out. This is what compels me to compel them, and I will do it by whatever means necessary.\n\nFor Beyoncé, Homecoming presents another opportunity to continue the boundary-shifting, semiotic work of the Coachella performance, which itself was built on the black-feminist symbolism of Lemonade and the artistic foundation she'd established for years beforehand. The singer's headlining 2018 set, which was nicknamed Beychella, was chock-full of references to black collegiate traditions -and also included a rendition of the black national anthem, \" Lift Every Voice and Sing .\" Her performance served a sly dual function: For black audiences, it was a masterly celebration of familiar traditions, including social dance ; for white viewers, it was an introduction and an assertion of her deeply rooted prowess. \"Instead of me pulling out my flower crown, it was more important that I brought our culture,\" she says of the festival experience. It's fitting, then, that Homecoming is now an extension of this artistic double consciousness (and notably quotes W. E. B. Du Bois , who coined the term). Throughout the documentary, Beyoncé weaves in text and audio snippets from multiple black authors, historians, and public thinkers, most often culling from moments when they spoke directly to black audiences. The nearly two-and-a-half-hour production, which Beyoncé wrote, directed, and executive-produced, is as much a celebration of black-intellectual history as it is a concert film. (It's also joined by a surprise live album of her Coachella set, which includes a bonus cover of the Frankie Beverly and Maze classic \"Before I Let Go.\") Early into Homecoming , Beyoncé explains the particular significance that historically black colleges and universities have held in her personal and artistic life. The Houston-born singer grew up near Prairie View A&M University and spent much of her early career rehearsing at Texas Southern University. She notes that, like Du Bois, her father is a graduate of Nashville's Fisk University, and she always dreamed of attending an HBCU herself, but says, \"My college was Destiny's Child. My college was traveling around the world, and life was my teacher.\" So when it came time for her to headline Coachella, she channeled the institutions' distinct vibrancy: \"I wanted a black orchestra. I wanted the steppers. I needed the vocalists. I wanted different characters; I didn't want us all doing the same thing.\" (She also established a scholarship program for HBCU students after last year's performance.)\n\nHomecoming is, of course, a product-and Beyoncé is, fundamentally, an entertainer-but it's still thrilling to see the world's foremost musical talent giddily dedicate so much of her massive project's screen time to citing a diverse array of black scholars. Not all of the thinkers the artist quotes throughout her documentary are graduates of an HBCU, but Homecoming still pulses with the kind of energy that black artists harness most often when working collaboratively with their own. Their work buoys Beyoncé and her audiences alike, and Homecoming takes care to credit HBCUs when applicable: If Howard University's Morrison nods to the beauty of artistic surrender, then of course Beyoncé, who cheekily called herself a \"black Bill Gates in the making\" on \"Formation,\" would also quote the late businessman Reginald Lewis, a graduate of Virginia State University. Offering a simple benediction that applies to both craft and the struggle for justice, Lewis says, \"Keep going, no matter what.\" A quote from the children's-rights advocate Marian Wright Edelman, a Spelman College graduate, affirms the power of representation: \"You can't be what you can't see.\" Together, these references form a refrain.\n\nThough Beyoncé has long occupied the upper echelon of pop stardom, Homecoming 's many references to black-intellectual tradition also serve to underscore the milestone-and embarrassment-of the artist being the first black woman to ever headline Coachella, a massive music festival that's been running for nearly 20 years. \"Ain't that 'bout a bitch?\" she infamously said with a laugh onstage after thanking the festival for selecting her for the dubious honor. Homecoming broadens the artist's accomplishment by contextualizing it within a larger body of work from black artists and theorists who toiled in-and often against-hostile, all-white institutions. Consider, for example, this selected quote from the late feminist theorist Audre Lorde: \"Without community, there is no liberation.\" Homecoming explains how Lorde's words apply to Beyoncé's artistic praxis: The documentary intentionally features black dancers, musicians, and fans from around the African diaspora, many of whom attended HBCUs. Toward the end of the film, one of the dancers notes, \"Homecoming for an HBCU is the Super Bowl. It is the Coachella.\" (Lorde's insistence that \"the personal is political\" would also have made a fitting addition to a documentary that spends an ample portion of its run time explaining how difficult it was for Beyoncé to return to a grueling rehearsal and production schedule after the 2017 birth of her twins, Sir and Rumi.) Though the singer notes that she'll never again push herself as hard as she did pre-Coachella (and post-birth), she ends Homecoming with a nod to the future-and to how deeply the creative blessings of the future are influenced by the communal spaces of the past: \"There is something incredibly important about the HBCU experience that must be celebrated and protected.\"\n\n* This article originally misidentified the voice that is heard after the final echoes of \"Formation.\" It is Nina Simone's, not Maya Angelou's.\""

      "text": "King's Death Gave Birth to Hip-Hop\n\nThe assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. led directly to hip-hop, an era of black American culture, politics, and art that is often contrasted with his legacy.\n\nThe interlude immediately following Outkast's \"Rosa Parks\" on their 1998 album, Aquemini, is perhaps the best starting point for understanding the group and the arts they bent to their whim. \"You gotta come provocative, nigga. You know what I mean?\" muses Wu-Tang Clan member Raekwon to Outkast's Big Boi. \"Shit gotta be spine-tingling with mad styles and crazy-dangerous, I mean, bust-ya-shit-open beats, you know what I mean?\"\n\nOstensibly, Raekwon's words foreshadow the coming song, or reflect on the four minutes of bluesy, foot-stomping brilliance that just unfolded in \"Rosa Parks.\" But they also serve as a guiding ethos for hip-hop, which was enjoying a banner year in 1998. Danger. Style. Funky beats and aural violence. Spines tingled from provocation, not the least of which was mine, then a 10-year-old boy listening to a hip-hop album with intent for the first time.\n\nBut not all listeners were as thrilled as I, and it wasn't just the pearl-clutching Fox News types who reacted negatively to the provocations of Big Boi and André 3000. As classic a song as it is, \"Rosa Parks\" is also known for sparking a 1999 lawsuit from the eponymous civil-rights legend, whose lawyers claimed that the song demeaned Parks, bore little connection to her actual legacy, and was full of needless vulgarity. The case sprawled across federal courts and spawned multiple controversies until it fizzled out, eventually ending in a quiet settlement. More than that, it outlined the key tension that has played out in black culture over the past five decades. Here were two revolutions: one the titanic timeline of the civil-rights movement, the other the rowdy, raunchy, rap rebellion of hip-hop. The case symbolized how many in both the media and black intellectual traditions pitted the two movements against each other for dominion over black culture. How could they be reconciled?\n\nThe answer can be found in the nascence of hip-hop. The question of the birth of hip-hop is a contentious one-as are all questions concerning the geneses of art forms-and full of rich debate on cultural touchstones, waves of influences, geography, visual art and dance, and stories of intrepid pioneers. Most of these debates locate the distinct emergence of the form in the mid-to-late-'70s. But a closer look reveals that the seeds of the art were sown by and during the civil-rights movement. The two aren't as opposed as they might seem.\n\nSpecifically, something of hip-hop's genesis can be detected amid the chaos following April 4, the day Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. Riots swept the nation, both the largest of the wave of annual multi-city uprisings in the '60s, and the last such outbreak for decades .\n\nAcross the country, young black people erupted with the violent anger that King himself had seen boiling over in the slums and consciously sought to diffuse. Although King's body of work had been centered in the South-often in its smaller cities and rural areas-the rage was the fiercest in major cities in the North and Midwest, as what James Baldwin called the \"powder keg\" of generations of frustration from the Great Migrants was ignited. Black youths in those centers railed against both the white and black power structure. For a week or more, much of black America was consumed in a hellscape. And there, in the primordial soup of chaos, the heat of rage, and the electric energy of frustration, the molecular components of what we know to be hip-hop were formed.\n\nThe tide of riots that struck much of Washington, D.C., illustrates many of these embryonic components. Back from a sojourn abroad as a global public intellectual, the Black Power leader Stokely Carmichael reappeared in the American public eye the night of King's assassination; his attempt at hastily organizing a march failed, and D.C. became one of the first of over 100 cities to experience riots. The following day, Carmichael held a press conference warning of widespread racial violence and panic in response to \"white America's biggest mistake.\"\n\nD.C. was ignited , and the black neighborhoods around U Street, H Street, and parts of the southeast quadrant of the city went up in flames, even as the National Guard descended upon the city and machine guns were mounted on the steps of the U.S. Capitol. But even there, amid what would become a decisive political and social battle for the racial future of the nation's capital, hip-hop was being born. Graffiti-linked with both punk and nascent hip-hop-made its first major appearance in the city as a political art tied to black activism. Sympathetic black business owners tagged their own doors with \"Soul Brother\" in order to escape the wrath of protesters, engaging in the Holy Week Uprising with their own improvised Passover ritual. Protesters sprayed the words \"Black Power\" across the city, engaging in both the defacement of public institutions and the act of domination that tagging would soon come to symbolize.\n\nIf viewed as a continuous multi-year uprising-a framework that Peter Levy's new book The Great Uprising compellingly proposes-it's clear that the decade's race riots, with the Holy Week Uprising as a final bookend, jolted black music as forcefully as they jolted all of black culture. Detroit's move toward a post-Motown sound was sparked by the 1967 riots, and transformed the city's sound scene with a \"gritty,\" agitated energy . In the Newark scene, the black nationalist-aligned Black Arts Movement, headlined since the mid-'60s by poets like Amiri Baraka, began to push into local politics. In March of 1968, just eight days before his assassination , King visited Baraka and spoke of solidarity between black groups, a meeting that helped propel Baraka's political career-and helped usher in a new wave of poets who would peer out at the world from the wreckage of the uprisings.\n\nOn May 19, 1968-on what would've been Malcolm X's birthday, and just a month after the end of the Holy Week Uprising-at Mount Morris Park in East Harlem, Felipe Luciano, Gylan Kain, and David Nelson founded the Original Last Poets, their moniker inspired by the poem \"Towards a Walk in the Sun,\" from the South African poet Keorapetse Kgositsile, who said that \"when the moment hatches in time's womb / there will be no art talk. The only poem / you will hear will be the spearpoint pivoted / in the punctured marrow of the villain.\" Several related groups performed under the monikor of the Last Poets afterwards. The most well-known trio to take on the mantle, Jalal Mansur Nuriddin, Abiodun Oyewole, and Umar Bin Hassan, consider themselves now to be the very first hip-hop artists, and according to Bin Hassan , \"are the microcosm of black America.\"\n\nOther radical poets like Gil Scott-Heron, whose debut, Small Talk at 125th and Lenox, was released in 1970, started their careers around the same time. On that album's opener, \"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised,\" Scott-Heron directly addressed the foment that inspired him to perform: \"There will be no pictures of you and Willie Mae / pushing that shopping cart down the block on the dead run / or trying to slide that color television into a stolen ambulance.\"\n\nBut, as part of the broadly defined Black Power generation that briefly took hold of the national conversation around black activism and race, the group of poets in the proto-hip-hop vanguard had a relatively short time in the spotlight. The pressures of a massive government-sponsored sabotage effort-culminating in the slaying of Black Panther leader Fred Hampton in 1969-effectively destabilized black radicalism. COINTELPRO, the FBI's massive surveillance and disruption operation of several radical American groups, started a file on the Last Poets ; Scott-Heron garnered himself an FBI file after the program was officially shuttered. In this, these artists shared as much with King as they did with many of the black radicals who'd heavily critiqued him: COINTELPRO's 1968 mission statement intended to \"prevent the rise of a 'Messiah'\" in black communities, and saw King himself as a key contender for the position, should he ever abandon nonviolence. This active sabotage from the highest places, across generations and different corners of a movement, helped define hip-hop as an art deeply tinged by paranoia and opposition to state power.\n\nWhat's become clear now with the vantage of time is that COINTELPRO was only part of a white counter-revolution that would reshape America over the following decades-and crystallize the modern relationship between working-class black America and the state. In his 2001 book, Soul Babies: Black Popular Culture and the Post-Soul Aesthetic , Duke University professor Mark Anthony Neal identifies the end of the \"Soul era\" with a series of musical and political shifts at the end of the 1970s and early '80s, including \"the emergence of the Reagan Right after the 1980 presidential election.\" According to Neal, \"It is of course largely the policies of the Reagan Right, particularly its eroding of civil-rights era legislation aimed at addressing historic inequities experienced by blacks that helped further instigate the advent of hip-hop music and culture, as hip-hop became the most visible site of an oppositional urban youth culture.\"\n\nNeal identifies the eroding of the civil-rights era legislation as a phenomenon that was strongest in the 1980s; it's possible, however, that the wide-scale demolition project against those reforms reached maturity well before that. King spoke often of fears of a \"white backlash,\" and fought against it in his late life-until it killed him. In almost every arena that is widely considered a civil-rights victory today, white reactionaries dug in their heels. Across the South, white people came up with a set of sophisticated mechanisms for avoiding school integration and extending the franchise to black people, and often in the North desegregation just plain never happened. In the North and Midwest, power structures gave black people some visibility and access to cultural currency, but still limited real political agency or access to mobility.\n\nAs noted by my colleague Abdallah Fayyad , one of the main mechanisms used to maintain the racial status quo in urbanized centers-particularly New York City-was that of housing segregation. The Fair Housing Act that Lyndon B. Johnson pushed to enact in the wake of King's death in April 1968 has never been fully implemented as written, or as King intended, and plans to implement it were thwarted during Richard Nixon's presidency. The lack of political will to actually enforce affirmative mechanisms in education and housing desegregation meant that residential patterns built by racist policy could not be changed.\n\nIn conjunction with mass disinvestment from black communities, enduring segregation, the final strokes of white flight, a suburbanizing geographic environment (symbolized in New York by the dominance of \"master builder\" Robert Moses), racist public-housing policy, pollution, and a host of other societal ills made the destruction of black inner-city life an inevitability. And that's especially so in the birthplace of hip-hop: The burning, hyper-segregated crumbling, impossibly dysfunctional Bronx of the late '70s is the backdrop to most hip-hop origin myths, but the kindling and match were already well in place 10 years before.\n\nWith all these factors in position, black youth born during King's time essentially saw the world unmade and refashioned in real time. They witnessed the rise of the carceral state, and were its first victims. They watched as the wounded Black Power institutions succumbed to sabotage and disintegrated into gangs. They experienced the first War on Drugs . They saw the deification of a certain sanitized version of King, divorced from their corrupted, blighted reality. They cowered from Nixon and Reagan, and also from thousands of local versions of Nixon and Reagan. In the pockets of urban America that serve as holy sites in the history of hip-hop today, it's safe to say that the youth straddling the civil-rights generation and whatever came next lived in a dystopia. And they saw, for better or worse, that the paradigms of black thought, art, and politics developed for the civil-rights movement were inadequate for their time.\n\nAs illustrated in Parks's lawsuit, some people in the generations preceding hip-hop thought and think hip-hop to be a vapid and crude exercise. Many object to the free use of the word nigga , many more to its shocking images of violence. If the lawsuit against Outkast can be stretched into a metaphor, even serious critics and lovers of hip-hop often think of it as a spiritually and morally degraded usurper of the civil-rights legacy, sampling from the greatest hits of an era while adding little of substance, or even actively diminishing the work of titans that came before.\n\nBut those critiques fail to engage with what hip-hop truly is, and what it was meant to be. Just like the spirituals invented during slavery, the blues that bubbled up after the collapse of Reconstruction, and the soul that took root during the civil-rights era, hip-hop was in a sense preordained by the social conditions of blackness. It became as much an embrace of the platform and victories for which King fought, and a necessary and careful distancing from the most pervasive pieces of his legacy, from the brand of masculinity stressed as his calling card, from the church, and from respectability. What hip-hop understands most viscerally is that it simply isn't enough to be like King. King was assassinated for being King.\n\nThese weren't just aesthetic choices, or even simply musical concepts. The power of Negro spirituals and of old soul songs in the vein of Sam Cooke's \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" came at least in part from the fact that even in moments of singular musical brilliance, they helped orient a people toward coping with struggle, and toward challenging the status quo. Hip-hop has to orient black youth toward coping with the \" New Jim Crow \" policies of modern America. As it does so, it carries on the legacy of the civil-rights movement much more than it refutes or dishonors its leaders.\n\nKing's assassination provided the necessary conditions for hip-hop to spring forth from the blood of generations that had spilled in street after street. The result in some cases is often bloody itself: messy, vulgar, and misogynistic from bar to bar. But, at its best, it's also what Raekwon hoped it would be. Hip-hop is provocative and dangerous, innovative, flexible, and accommodating. It's the binding ethos now in multiple generations of post-King black people, and it's becoming a base for liberatory political movements and a wellspring of activism energy. The final irony in all this is that in its deeply held fear of a black \"Messiah\" arising, the government missed that black youth were creating their own."

      "text": "The Rebellious Rap Debut That Disrupted 'Safe' Black Culture\n\nHip-hop has no shortage of game-changing debuts. In 1989, De La Soul 's 3 Feet High and Rising announced the emergence of a quirky nerd rap sensibility just as the world was discovering gangsta rap; 15 years later, Kanye West 's The College Dropout announced a shift away from street hop toward hipster rap aesthetics. And long before those, the self-titled first album from Queens legends Run-D.M.C. marked the dawn of hip-hop's mainstream takeover. As such, Run-D.M.C. -which celebrated its 40th anniversary this week-was the beginning of an expansion on the idea of what it meant to be Black in the 1980s; an opening for street kids to assert themselves and insert their world into American popular culture.\n\nRun DMC's Joseph \"Run\" Simmons and Darryl \"D.M.C.\" McDaniels pose in Central Park, New York, 1984.\n\nRun-D.M.C. had been born out of the ambitions of Joey \"DJ Run\" Simmons, younger brother to rap promoter Russell and early understudy to the legendary Kurtis Blow. After a stint as Blow's kid DJ (known as \"DJ Run, Son of Kurtis Blow\"), Run convinced his brother to help him record his own demo for a song called \"Street Kid.\" He recruited neighborhood friend Darryl McDaniels to be his rhyme partner, and after they started rapping together in their hometown of Hollis, Queens, they met an aspiring DJ in Jason Mizell (who would later go by Jam Master Jay ). With the elder Simmons now pushing the trio he'd dubbed \"Run-D.M.C.,\" they landed a deal with Profile Records and released their debut double-release single \"It's Like That/Sucker MCs\" in late 1983. Lauded as the dawning of rap's first \"new school,\" that hit instantly set anticipation for their first LP.\n\nThe debut album from Run, Dee, and Jam Master Jay was a recalibration of rap music: What had previously been a singles-driven genre defined by mostly party songs was moving into more album-focused, sonically hard-hitting territory. Larry Smith's production was dark and aggressive compared to the disco sounds of earlier rap hits like The Sugarhill Gang's \"Rapper's Delight,\" and the subject matter took its cues from Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five's classic commentary track \"The Message.\" \"Rock Box\" announced the trio as genre-bending innovators (a full two years before \"Walk This Way,\" their chart-busting collaboration with Aerosmith ) and Jam Master Jay lionized the group's soon-to-be legendary turntablist. \"It's Like That\" dropped like an atom bomb; a sinister slice of Smith-produced sonic doom that made it clear that hip-hop was entering a new day.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"It showed that we had the big gold chain and the fancy car and that we were truly the superstars of the neighborhood, you know,\" D.M.C. recalled to NPR's Terry Gross last year. \"'Cause if you got a big chain and the other guy don't, you must be doing something. And, you know, it also brought a bad image to us because people that didn't know Run-D.M.C. before we had an album cover out thought we was just drug dealers because most of the drug dealers was wearing chains like that and driving in big cars, even before the rappers made it big.\"\n\nRun-D.M.C. wasn't the first major rap release of its era-six months earlier, the Brooklyn trio Whodini released their self-titled debut. But unlike Whodini, whose popularity would remain largely confined to the R&B charts, Run-D.M.C. would land on the Billboard 200 album chart en route to gold commercial status. It put the group on MTV, as the hard guitar licks of \"Rock Box\" were a natural fit for the still rock-driven network's video rotations. It put Run-D.M.C. at the forefront of a cultural zeitgeist, and it saved rap music from the realm of novelty.\n\nAmerican rap group Run DMC pose at the Grammy Awards in 1988.\n\n\"Before us,\" Jam-Master Jay told Spin in 1986, \"rap records was corny. Everything was soft. Nobody made no hard beat records. Everybody just wanted to sing, but they didn't know how to sing, so they'll just rap on the record. There was no real meaning to a rapper. [Afrika Bambaataa] and them was getting weak. Flash was getting weak. Everybody was telling me it was a fad. And before Run-D.M.C. came along, rap music could have been a fad.\"\n\nFurther, the success of Run-D.M.C. set the stage for the rise of Def Jam Recordings. Although the group itself was never signed to the legendary label, their breakthrough led to Simmons and producer Rick Rubin launching their imprint with the 1984 single \"It's Yours\" and landing a distribution deal with CBS Records. And the album cemented Smith as the foremost rap producer of the mid-1980s, with hits from the aforementioned Whodini and The Fat Boys also under his belt.\n\nBut Run-D.M.C. 's impact extended far beyond just musical spaces, breaking into American pop culture in a big way. About six months after the album dropped, The Cosby Show premiered on NBC, and would go on to become the most popular TV show of the decade, opening the gates for a wave of popular, family-friendly Black sitcoms. The weekly exploits of the Huxtable clan would be groundbreaking in its depiction of middle-class Black American lives, becoming a totem of sorts for the image of an upward-climbing post-Civil Rights generation of Black professionals. It's understandable if one views The Cosby Show and Run-D.M.C . as diametrically opposed-the rap group that mainstreamed hip-hop by embracing the street sensibilities of Black culture versus a sitcom that became a phenomenon by rejecting those same sensibilities.\n\nRun D.M.C. on American Bandstand in 1985.\n\nAt a time when so much of Black popular culture would be driven by a sense of safe accessibility, Run-D.M.C. led a wave of rap renegades whose look and sound seemed to be an affront to a generation embracing the suit-wearing sensibilities of then-contemporary R&B and the universal appeal of popular artists like Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie . The menace that some associated with Run-D.M.C.'s thunderous beats, fedoras, and non-smiling album cover was more implied than anything else, but it was a staunchly rebellious presentation at a time when \"crossing over\" was high currency.\n\nIn the landscape of aspirational '80s Black pop culture, Run-D.M.C.'s debut brought urban aesthetics to the mainstream. It was a harbinger of rap's rise in the second half of the decade, but more importantly, it highlighted a side of Blackness that wasn't beholden to respectability. Revisiting it 40 years later, it's clear that their debut altered Black pop culture in the 1980s while also announcing hip-hop's mainstreaming-though Run-D.M.C. themselves knew all along how massive it would be.\n\n\"I knew it was going to be a culture shock,\" Run said in 2018 . \"I knew it was more than just music with what we were coming with. It was the attitude, fashion, and the hip-hop coming together with something bigger.\"\n\nstereowilliams@gmail.com\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "Congo Square Under Siege: The Latest Threat to Black Culture's Ground Zero in New Orleans\n\nPortia Pollack, 60, lived in a cottage in New Orleans' Seventh Ward, downriver from Louis Armstrong Park. A physical therapist by trade, she was a percussionist in the Sunday drum gatherings at Congo Square, a corner of the park facing Rampart Street.\n\nWith swinging dreadlocks and a sunny smile, Portia was a mainstay of 33 years with Bamboula 2000 and its successor, the Congo Square Preservation Society , led by veteran percussionist Luther Gray. She played djembe, congas, bongos, and harmonica, Sunday after Sunday.\n\nDrawing locals and tourists, the drummers perform on the site where generations ago enslaved Africans resurrected rituals of the mother culture. In ring dances, the Africans paid homage to their ancestors, spinning to the rhythms of hand drums and strings on a vast field behind the rampart, or back wall of the town-today's French Quarter.\n\n\"The dancing and singing were directed to the ancestors and gods, the tempo and revolution of the circle quickening during the course of movement,\" writes Sterling Stuckey in Slave Culture. \"The ring in which Africans danced and sang is the key to understanding the means by which they achieved oneness in America.\"\n\nThese few remaining acres of Congo Square carry a story of survival and momentum, a spiritual essence carried in a long stream of writing and art, performance and protest. The cultural memory is mythic, a freedom quest told and retold by a procession of people pulled to the properties of freedom.\n\nFor Africans, the field began in the 1740s as a makeshift Sunday marketplace. As planters in a weak economy struggled to feed the enslaved, Africans traded their own crops, shellfish, and meat, while dances of ritual memory sprouted in rings. Over time, the number of dancers would grow as the space would shrink. In the early 1800s, the city spilled across the rampart when the first suburb, Tremé, mushroomed around the open space; free people of color become prominent homeowners in the area created as slaveholder Claude Tremé sold off land. As the dancing rings enlarged, so did crowds of onlookers-among them Indians, free Blacks, and European and American travelers, who left written accounts, like this one from 1819: \"The African slaves meet on the green, by the swamp, and rock the city with their Congo dances.\"\n\nOn June 7 Portia Pollack died of stab wounds outside her house about 7:30 a.m. The latest news of a surging homicide rate struck a jagged blow to Portia's niece, friends, and musical comrades. Luther Gray went to her porch that night and sent up a percussive eulogy with other drummers, and again that weekend at a memorial held at Congo Square.\n\n\"Portia was a sister to all of the dozens of drummers in our community, and a generous and faithful friend,\" Gray tells The Daily Beast. \"She was the first and longest female drummer with us. She was a composer, a band leader, and martial artist.\"\n\nMeanwhile, with awful timing, Mayor LaToya Cantrell promoted a massive renovation for Municipal Auditorium-the big walled building on the grounds of Congo Square-to serve as the new City Hall. The auditorium has been dormant since the 2005 Hurricane Katrina flood. FEMA, however, has $38 million on the table for restoration.\n\nThe auditorium for generations hosted white Mardi Gras balls, stirring ire in the historic Black neighborhood of Tremé, which in the mid-1960s lost 16 square blocks to City Hall demolitions for an ill-fated \"Lincoln Center of the South.\" The mayor back then, Victor Hugo Schiro, was the last white segregationist. Razing all those houses created the green space-a park belatedly named for Louis Armstrong. Municipal Auditorium and the severely reduced footprint of Congo Square stand at one end of the park. The city's assault left deep wounds in surviving areas of the neighborhood. So did cutting down a long stretch of beautiful oak trees along the North Claiborne Avenue neutral ground to accommodate an I-10 overpass with access to the business district, a feat of urban renewal that killed a bustling strip of Black-owned businesses.\n\nBuilt in 1957, the current City Hall building is a business district eyesore of Kleenex-box architecture, a medium-rise albeit with windows, now coveted by developers for demolition and rebuilding. The mayor, city council, judges, and civil court staff who work there would welcome sweeter digs-but where?\n\nOn June 17, four days after Portia Pollack's memorial, Congo Square filled with several hundred protesters, raising signs saying No City Hall in Trem é, ...Sacred Land. Councilwoman Kristin Gisleson Palmer, who represents Tremé, cut bait on Cantrell: \"We can't possibly have a place that represents us if the community does not want us to be here.\" Two other council members echoed Palmer. The crowd marched a mile to rally outside City Hall.\n\nThe City Hall protesters included the leading artist of the Masking Indian tradition, Big Chief Demond Melancon of the Young Seminole Hunters; his suits of beaded patches and billowing feathers and plumes hang in museums and high-priced galleries.\n\n\"Those trees in Congo Square and Armstrong Park have eyes,\" he told The Daily Beast. \"They've seen the dancing and seen slavery, hard and cruel. There's a significance of Congo Square the mayor doesn't get. We need a way to get her to know about it. I understand she needs to use that FEMA money.\"\n\nRachel Hutchinson, demonstrating with her 5-year old son, called the mayor \"the Queen of NOLA because she's trying to move her castle to the Municipal Auditorium, and we don't want her to do that because Congo Square is sacred ground .\"\n\nCantrell quickly backed off , saying that protesters \"deserve to have their voices heard,\" calling for a commission to explore options for City Hall relocation while getting the auditorium renovation underway. Cantrell faces a fall reelection without major opposition so far.\n\nPalmer gathered full support from the city council on a measure that blocks city permits for developers to work on government-related construction within Louis Armstrong Park for a year or until the council reverses course. Cantrell faces hard blowback if the city tampers with \"sacred ground.\"\n\nJoy Harjo, the U.S. Poet Laureate, a member of the Muscogee Creek nation in Tulsa, links Congo Square to her lineage in Crazy Brave, a 2012 memoir:\n\n<p>As I write this I hear the din of voices of so many people, and so many stories that want to come forth. Each name is a tributary to many others, to many places. I see the spirit of New Orleans and hear the singing of the spirit of Congo Square. Congo Square was originally a southeastern Indian ceremonial ground. It became a meeting place for tribal peoples, Africans, and their European friends, lovers and families. They gathered there to dance, to enjoy the music and the food wrapped in cloths and gourds they brought to share. These people, our ancestors, want to be recognized; they want to be remembered.</p>\n\nBefore the French founded the city in 1718, the Choctaw and other tribes at the oxbow of the lower Mississippi River called the site \"Bulbancha\"-place of many tongues. Indians held ritual dances seeking fertile harvests on the area that would become Congo Square. Today the park also draws performances by Black Masking Indian gangs-the name preferred by Mardi Gras Indians-a tradition of music and feathered suits begun as early as 1883. Blacks used the freedom of Carnival season, parading in part in memory of Native Americans who accepted enslaved Africans who had escaped from the plantation system into their communities.\n\nIn 1786, two decades after the colonial port passed from French to Spanish control, Bishop Cirilo Sieni de Barcelona complained in a pastoral letter of \"Negroes who at the vespers hour assembled in a green expanse called 'Place Congo' to dance the bamboula and perform the rites imported from Africa by the Yolofs, Foulahs, Bambarras, Mandingoes and other races.\" Sieni identifies specific tribal cultures and names the dance, bamboula .\n\nBambula in the Kikunga language of Kongo means \"to remember\" or \"to remind,\" as Ned Sublette reveals in The World That Made New Orleans, a distinguished history of the Spanish era (1766-1802). A percussionist holds a small cylindrical drum, babula, between the legs, hitting swift lines to the harder, pounding rhythms of the larger drum, as dancers move one-on-one inside the ring.\n\nPlace Congo dancers had seared memories of two years before the bishop's letter when the legendary Juan St. Maló, who had bolted slavery to create a community of maroons-runaways living with their families in marshland south of town-was wounded in a shoot-out. Captured by authorities, St. Maló was shipped up the river in a barge. He was hung before a huge crowd at Plaza de Armas (today's Jackson Square), then and now a ceremonial center between the river and St. Louis church. A dozen blocks down, the Congo field nurtured a life force of resistance: African-blooded people danced with coded meanings in the dance.\n\nAfrican people kept St. Maló's memory alive. A poem eulogizing St. Maló surfaced a century after his death, sung by an elderly woman for the writer George Washington Cable. In recent decades St. Maló has been celebrated in the lyrics of zydeco bluesman Bruce \"Sunpie\" Barnes .\n\n\"Congo Square is one of the most sacred locations in the African diaspora-one of the few places in North America where authorities allowed enslaved people to assemble en masse to socialize, dance, and make music in styles recalled from Africa,\" Berkeley professor of English Bryan Wagner told The Daily Beast. \"These traditions would influence a wide range of modern performance styles in music and dance, most notably in jazz.\"\n\nRaised in New Orleans, Wagner keeps returning in his books. The Legend of Bras-Coupé, a 2019 work of inspired research, has a terse subtitle: The Fugitive Slave Who Fought the Law, Ruled the Swamp, Danced at Congo Square, Invented Jazz and Died for Love. Bras-Coup é means \"severed arm\"-the one lost by the maroon rebel in a battle with police in the 1830s. Bras-Coup é is a spiritual descendant of St. Maló; he escaped Charity Hospital and fled to the outlying swamp, roaming as St. Malo had done a half-century past. \"For years, Bras-Coupé and his gang raided stores and taverns on the outskirts,\" writes Wagner.\n\nSensationalized press portrayed the one-armed maroon as a savage. \"In the oral tradition,\" writes Wagner, \"Bras-Coupé was given superpowers. He could breathe fire. He could teleport. His skin, it was said, could not be punctured by bullets.\" The abolitionist press published respectful obituaries after Bras-Coupé was shot to death, betrayed by a friend for reward money. The authorities in a grotesque display of white power laid the bloodied corpse at the plaza facing St. Louis Cathedral.\n\nGeorge Washington Cable, who published the dirge to St. Maló, drew on the Bras-Coupé events in his 1880 novel, The Grandissimes. Set in the 1790s, the plot turns on a plantation aristocracy addled by an African warrior-prince, his arm lost in battle, sold into slavery. Bolting from his subservience, he shocks the master of the big house. Cable, who wrote pioneering essays on Congo Square for Century magazine, casts Bras-Coupé, the royalty-turned-outlier, as a force haunting the big house, bringing ruin as if to a broken moral order in Greek tragedy.\n\n\"The plantation became an invalid camp. The words of the voudou found fulfillment on every side. The plough went not out; the herds wandered through broken hedges from field to field and came up with staring bones and shrunken sides; a frenzied mob of weeds and thorns wrestled and throttled each other in a struggle for standing room-rag-weed, smart-weed, sneezed-weed, bind-weed, iron-weed-until the burning skies of midsummer checked their growth and crowned their unshorn tops with rank and dingy flowers.\"\n\nIn Cable's novel, Bras-Coupé goes down not in bloody betrayal but as an ecstatic dancer, dressed as an Indian at Congo Square when Spanish authorities seize him. His ears are cut off for having struck his owner. As he's dying, a priest asks if he knows where he's going. \"To Africa,\" he replies-echoing the belief of many enslaved people, that death would take them home. When the Civil War ended, Black crowds celebrated at Congo Square-free at last.\n\nBy the early 1900s when Sidney Bechet was a boy, the place was called Beauregard Square, renamed for a Confederate general with painted posts restricting the green space. The moving rings had opened out into a flow of street dancers, the second line of spontaneous choreographies following brass bands. Black musicians changed the repertoire of the marching band tradition with spirituals for dirges and swinging rhythms to loosen the spine of military marches; the dancing behind funerals became spectacles of freedom on city streets, rituals of mourning police were hard-pressed to thwart.\n\nAs mythic rebels, St. Maló and Bras-Coupé found an avatar sprung from Sidney Bechet, the great jazz clarinetist and soprano sax player. Bechet as a boy absorbed stories of Congo Square from his father, Omar. Their Seventh Ward home was in walking distance of Congo Square. The memory flow poured out in the early 1950s when Bechet, a celebrated expatriate in Paris, began dictating his memoirs to a tape recorder. The poet John Ciardi, translating The Divine Comedy while on a sabbatical from Harvard, was mesmerized by Bechet's jazz sets and struck up a friendship with the musician. Ciardi edited the transcript of reminiscences as a narrative in Bechet's inimitable voice. Bechet died in 1959, the French honored him with a state funeral. His memoir, Treat It Gentle, was published a year later; the most riveting chapter is called \"Omar\"-the story of his grandfather.\n\n\"My grandfather was a slave. But he was a man that could do anything. He could sing; he danced, he was a leader... Sundays when the slaves would meet-that was their free day to beat out rhythms on drums at the Square-Congo Square they called it-and they'd all be gathered there around him.\"\n\n\"Making his own drums, Omar roamed the bayous, hunting and fishing.\" Bechet enters his grandfather's mind: \"And when he awoke and remembered where he was-that chant, that memory, got mixed up in a kind of melody that had a crying inside itself. The part of him that was the tribe and the drums-that part moved on and became a spiritual... And then he'd hear the drums from the square. First one drum, then another one answering it. Then a lot of drums. Then a voice, one voice. And then a refrain, a lot of voices joining and coming into each other.\"\n\nOmar meets an enslaved woman from a plantation across the swamp. Love surges between them. Her white owner grows jealous, and gathers men, accusing Omar of having raped his daughter. A mob goes searching for him in the swamp; the master's wife realizes the truth, her husband's lust for a slave girl. Like St. Maló, Omar becomes the hunted; he steals back to the plantation to see his beloved. They lie together, then he retreats to a friend's cabin in the swamp, a price on his head. Like Bras-Coupé, Omar is betrayed: the friend kills him.\n\nBechet: \"And you could hear the mourning all the slaves were singing, trying to tell my grandfather to prepare a place for them, trying to give him some of their religion in case he got a need for it. They were singing, chanting again, beating themselves with their hands, beating on the ground, finding a way to let my grandfather go.\"\n\nTreat It Gentle was well-received for its melodic prose by a supreme jazz artist. Some critics questioned how much was factual. Researching a 1987 biography, Sidney Bechet: Wizard of Jazz, John Chilton learned that Bechet came from a long line of free colored Creoles. His father, Omar, was a shoemaker who raised seven children with his wife. One brother became a dentist. A grade school drop-out who immersed himself in the clarinet, Bechet in his twilight invented an enslaved grandfather for a short story of powerful spoken prose. Omar embodies Congo Square. \"It was his drum, his voice, his dancing.\" It's doubtful that Bechet read Cable's novel. The more likely source of the legend was his father, Omar, whom he references in passing as sharing stories. Bechet's narrative carries the history he knew in his marrow.\n\nOmar is Bras-Coupé retold, the maroon rebel whose image is captured in an illustrious Masking Indian suit by Big Chief Demond Melancon of the Young Seminole Hunters. Melancon read Cable's novel at the urging of photographer Christopher Porché West. \"I knew I had to deal with who Bras-Coupé was and what he did,\" says Melancon, 43, a self-supporting artist, in his Ninth Ward studio.\n\n\"I pulled concrete for fifteen years and then I was a lobster cook for three years. I'd get fired at Mardi Gras for making my suit\" for the parading day.\n\n\"The research brought me back to knowing that Bras-Coupé was the first Black master, a heroic figure in our neighborhood. Them killing him, putting his body out in public, made us know he was a hero of the day. Back in Congo Square he was dressed as an Indian. It's a connection between Bras-Coupé and Black maskers throughout Tremé all the way down to the Ninth Ward and back Uptown. Bras-Coupé is the first masker to me. When we mask it's in rebellion to the injustices still happening in the world today.\"\n\nOver many years of reading, interviews, and writing as a journalist and jazz historian, I dreamed of filming Congo Square, giving the past a visual life. In a late '90s oral history project, I filmed jazz funerals and interviews with musicians. The burial pageants were rarely covered in the press. I saw each one as a performance story of a life, a neighborhood, a memory drama extending from a long line of ritual. How did jazz funerals begin? Reading Cable, Bechet, Sterling Stuckey, Gwendolyn Midlo Hall, and art scholar Robert Farris Thompson's brilliant interpretation of African masking rites, I wanted to show the danced-memory of ancestral worship as seedbed of a tradition-burial processions as parades of freedom with the second line of street dancers.\n\nThe Ford Foundation supported my oral history project with Tulane University's Hogan Jazz Archive, providing a base of footage. In 1999 I sent Ford a proposal for a production budget with a 10-minute trailer and treatment to include a Congo Square sequence. \"Reenactments have a bad odor at PBS,\" the grant officer said in turning it down. Within a few years PBS had taken a more expansive view of documentary films. As HBO, Netflix, and streaming platforms opened greater outlets for documentaries, directors like Alex Gibney chartered new borders of storytelling with cinematic techniques similar to feature films, or creative nonfiction in literature.\n\nIn 2002 I was drawn into reporting on the crisis in the Catholic Church, which led to two books and a 2008 documentary . Each time I flew back from Rome, within a few days I was sitting at a wake for a musician or culture-bearer, soon following the river of second liners with bobbing umbrellas in the street. Here was a closeness to God, a sorrow-unto-joy of people celebrating the soul's release, an African reach of the spirit one rarely saw elsewhere. Whenever I could scrounge up funds, I hired a crew, made a donation to the grieving family, and filmed a funeral. Editor Tim Watson and I felt that one day, with luck, these would be scenes in a film.\n\nWe had a protagonist in Dr. Michael White, the gentlemanly jazz composer and Xavier University professor whose clarinet sang African-styled lamentation in funerals, the wailing widow.\n\nBut the world crashed in 2005 when the federal levees broke and Hurricane Katrina's epic flood filled Michael's home with eight feet of water; his thousands of books, recordings and compositions were mush underfoot as Philip Braun and I filmed his aching return. Several weeks later my daughter, Simonette Berry, 21, joined me in recovering Michael's African carvings for storage at my place, which was dry. The city took years to recover; so did homeowners like White in a broken town.\n\nWe finally regrouped on the documentary in 2016, raising funds from grants and donations. A solid base of film professionals had returned to New Orleans. Simonette had built a career as a scenic artist, sculptor, and designer. I hired her as co-producer to manage the field shoots and planning for Congo Square. I was about to publish City of a Million Dreams , a New Orleans history with funerals as a thematic thread. My narrative viewfinder expanded thanks to author Freddi Williams Evans' Congo Square: African Roots in New Orleans (2011). A Black scholar, Freddi compared photographs of African instruments with architect Benjamin Latrobe's 1819 eyewitness drawings of Congo Square drums, strings, and performers. In their books, Freddi Evans and Ned Sublette linked Latrobe's images and observations in Impressions Respecting New Orleans to specific traditions from Kongo.\n\nA summer 2018 Kickstarter campaign yielded $20,000 that helped us start planning for Congo Square. Knowing it would take a good deal more than that to film the reenactment, I was scrambling when Bernard F. Pettingill Jr., a pal from Jesuit High School years who followed my work, called from his estate in Florida. A star football player back when, Biff Pettingill had a genial swagger and a laser-beam focus I never appreciated as his path led to a Ph.D. at London School of Economics. When we renewed the friendship years later, he was a forensic economist in West Palm Beach, an expert witness in high-stakes litigation. \"I saw the trailer on Kickstarter,\" he said. \"What do you need to finish the movie?\"\n\nCounting the early Ford budget, we'd spent nearly $300,000 on interviews and filming funerals. Many documentaries raise budget through a combination of grants, fundraisers, and investment. Harris Done, a Los Angeles cinematographer who shot my Vatican film, was director of photography on this one, working at far less than his usual rate, as many film professionals do for documentaries as \"passion projects.\" Quickly calculating costs to finish. I swallowed, closed my eyes and breathed out a healthy six-figure sum. Biff said: \"Oh, I can do that. What about percentages?\" We soon agreed on profit points after repayment of his stake.\n\nWith Evans as an adviser, Simonette worked on the storyboard, designing costumes and decoration for the set. Latrobe was the only known eyewitness who drew what he saw. E.W. Kemble's drawings that illustrated Cable's 1886 essays in Century Magazine provided the other set of images for planning-reimagined images drawn from Cable's well-researched descriptions decades after the dances ended. We were recreating vistas of a past with far more research than Cable had.\n\nSimonette chose Alison Parker as costume designer. Steeped in knowledge of historical and period piece styles, Alison was also working for a production similar to ours, scheduled several months later, artist Dread Scott's reenactment of the 1811 slave rebellion on upriver plantations [featured in the new C.J. Hunt-Darcy McKinnon film The Neutral Ground on PBS.] Alison had a meticulous eye for clothing the enslaved wore, particularly tignons or headdresses to meld with human rhythms.\n\nChoreography was the crucial job, orchestrating the dances of African peoples, based on the research and images. We turned to Monique Moss, a Black scholar at Tulane University focused on diaspora culture. Monique had done research travel in the Caribbean. She had also gone to Republic of Congo with Titos Sompa, a renowned percussionist and dancer from Brazzaville who had led Congolese dance troupes in Paris and American cities. At the time of the production, Titos Sompa was based in Detroit. He had worked with Chico Freeman, Sun Ra, Ron Carter, Pharoah Sanders, and legions of jazzmen. Monique's other guide in Congo was Titos' younger brother Jean-Claude Biza Sompa, a master drummer and dancer who teaches Congolese dance at University of Michigan.\n\n\"Papa Titos explained that the living world is entwined with angels, or ancestors,\" says Moss. \"That convinced me to use artistic license in shaping Kongolese dance patterns. Historical illustrations gave us an idea of the formations. I asked Biza Sompa to choreograph specific movement phrases related to the meaning of Bamboula, letting each dancer improvise their solos inside the ring formed by the larger group.\"\n\nMoss had long ties with New Orleans artists steeped in West African dance. Luther Gray and dancer Jamila Muhammad founded Bamboula 2000, performing the bamboula rhythm at public festivals, \"showing the historic root of the second line beat played by brass bands,\" says Moss. Several dozen musicians and dancers thrived on workshops with such figures as the late Babatunde Olatunjii, the Yoruba master drummer known for the classic album Drums of Passion .\n\nNew Orleans had also become home to Seguenon Kone, a multi-instrumentalist from Ivory Coast who performed and taught Ivorian, Senegambian, and other dance traditions. Seguenon, who recorded on balafon with Dr. Michael White on Adventures in New Orleans Music, Part 1 (Basin Street Records), assisted with recruiting local dancers for the filming.\n\nIn October 2018 Titos and Jean-Claude Biza Sompa flew from Detroit to New Orleans to lead the African orchestra coming together. Another Congolese drummer in Michigan, along with four Ivorian percussionists based in Maryland and New York, joined Luther Gray and Bill Summers of New Orleans, rounding out the band.\n\nRampart Street's lumbering traffic made the real Congo Square unsuitable for filming. We needed a large green space. Simonette found it in rural Belle Chasse, a town in Plaquemines Parish south of the Lower Ninth Ward. The huge grassy area backed by towering trees lay along a levee opposite the small government complex. Parish President Amos Cormier embraced Simonette's request, and approved the three-day film schedule for a modest fee. Parish officials were unfailingly helpful.\n\nAs roughly 120 people converged on this beautiful swath of land-including cinematographers, sound engineers, assistant directors, costume workers, extras, first aid personnel, and caterers-I watched the set come alive, mindful as a white man of how fortunate I was in having so many Black friends and colleagues. We paid everyone as well as we could, without complaints. Nevertheless, Blacks who enact the roles of enslaved Africans experience an intensity whites cannot imagine. I wanted this work to be validating as possible for them.\n\nFather Jerome LeDoux, the popular former pastor of St. Augustine parish in Tremé, agreed to do an invocation. For years LeDoux had defied church law by performing funerals of drug war victims whose families weren't Catholic. \"How could I face Jesus otherwise?\" he once told me.

Soon the other instruments raised a percussive thunder; more dancers filled the space, dancing in rings of time as I watched, breathless and grateful.\n\nThe documentary City of a Million Dreams had its first screening at the 2021 Sarasota Film Festival.

      "text": "Common, Pharrell, and 'The New Black': An Ignorant Mentality That Undermines the Black Experience\n\nThe rapper Common made waves during a recent appearance on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart when he offered his take on race in America. It isn't nearly so simple.\n\n\"The New Black doesn't blame other races for our issues.\"\n\nSo decreed Pharrell Williams when the hit-making superstar spoke to Oprah last summer about the current racial climate in America. In the months following the release of Pharrell's sugary soul-pop hit \"Happy,\" the country struggled through a summer that saw a string of high-profile cases involving police killing innocent black citizens. But while speaking to Oprah, and having watched clips of fans paying tribute to his uber-cheerful single, Pharrell decided to advertise a \"new\" mindset for black people to adopt-one of good ol' positive thinking.\n\n\"The New Black dreams and realizes that it's not pigmentation: it's a mentality, and it's either going to work for you or it's going to work against you. And you've got to pick the side you're going to be on,\" Pharrell said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHis words were laughably empty and insulting to the current climate, the history of black ambition in the face of tremendous cultural oppression, and the reality of institutional racism; but they also represented a vocal cadre of black celebritydom that is calling for the black community to basically \"get over it.\" With the racial conversation in the national spotlight, stars like Williams, Kanye West, and others aren't addressing racism in as much as they are deflecting the conversation.\n\nRapper/actor Common appeared on The Daily Show With Jon Stewart last week to promote his new film Run All Night . Alongside singer-songwriter John Legend, the Chicago rhymer won an Oscar in February for \"Glory,\" the theme song from the Martin Luther King biopic Selma . While discussing the legacy of the 1960s Civil Rights Movement and the current tensions, Stewart expressed what he's seen from white people who are resistant to discussing structural racism.\n\n\"There's a real vein of anger, like 'Hey, man-I didn't have slaves!'\" Stewart stated. \"But they're not talking about that, they're talking about a power structure.\"\n\nCommon, while not countering Stewart's statement, offered his perspective on the way to heal wounds that have existed on American soil for centuries.\n\n\"We all know there's been some bad history in our country. We know that racism exists,\" the star conceded, before adding, \"I'm...extending a hand. And I think a lot of generations and different cultures are saying 'Hey, we want to get past this. We've been bullied and we've been beat down, but we don't want it anymore. We're not extending a fist and saying, 'Hey, you did us wrong.' It's more like 'Hey, I'm extending my hand in love. Let's forget about the past as much as we can, and let's move from where we are now. How can we help each other? Can you try to help us because we're going to help ourselves, too.' That's really where we are right now.\"\n\n\"Me as a black man, I'm not sitting there like, 'White people-y'all did us wrong,'\" Common continued. \"I mean we know that that existed. I don't even have to keep bringing that up. It's like being in a relationship and continuing to bring up the person's issues.\"\n\nThroughout the interview, Common continued to liken American race relations to a difficult romantic relationship (\"Let's get past this\") while echoing comments he's made both during his Oscar speech in February and in recent interviews. Common wants us all to love each other. His Oscar speech was a sentimental bear hug, the kind of expression of superficial \"unity\" that tugs at the heartstrings without forcing anyone to think deeper about the specifics of conflict. While turning the Edmond Pettis Bridge-where people marching for the right to vote were beaten by officers of the state-into a symbol for this \"unity,\" his sentimentality is an easy pill for the Oscar crowd to swallow. \"The spirit of this bridge transcends race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, and social status. The spirit of this bridge connects the kid from the South Side of Chicago dreaming of a better life to those in France standing up for their freedom of expression, to the people in Hong Kong protesting for democracy , \" Common said at the Oscars.\n\nAlso this week, actress Raven-Symone found herself in the midst of another controversy after she defended the racist remarks Univision host Rodner Figueroa made about Michelle Obama. Figueroa was dismissed from his position on El Gordo y la Flaca following the comment and the ensuing fallout, but when the subject came up on The View , Symone was dismissive of the racial implications.\n\nCo-host Rosie Perez blasted Figueroa for his comments, and went on to address racism in the Latino community.\n\n\"There is a secret in the Latin community-specifically the Caribbean, Central American Latin community-they are very racist,\" said the Puerto Rican actress. \"They never want to be in the same group as black people. And it's sad. It's very, very sad. And he did say that Michelle Obama looked like a cast member of Planet of the Apes .\"\n\nSymone objected, however.\n\n\"Was he saying it racist-like?\" she asked. \"He said he voted for her later, and I don't think he was saying it racist.\"\n\n\"This is a problem in the Latin community. We do not talk about that,\" Perez stated, emphasizing her disgust that a racist joke would be made about the First Lady of the United States.\n\nBut Symone defended her position.\n\n\"Not Michelle Obama-Michelle, don't fire me for this, but-some people look like animals. Is that rude?\" she cracked. \"I look like a bird... so can I be mad at somebody that calls me 'Toucan Sam'?\"\n\nThe former Disney starlet is guest-starring on hit shows like Empire and black-ish , and she came under fire in 2014 after she announced that she prefers not to think of herself as an African American, but as simply an American .\n\n\"I don't want to be labeled gay, I want to be labeled a human who loves humans,\" Symone told Oprah last fall. \"I'm tired of being labeled. I'm an American. I'm not an African American. I'm an American.\n\n\"I don't know where my roots go to. I don't know how far back they go... I don't know what country in Africa I'm from,\" she continued. \"But I do know that my roots are in Louisiana. I'm an American. That's a colorless person. We're all people. I have lots of things running through my veins. I have darker skin. I have a nice, interesting grade of hair. I can connect with Caucasian, I connect with Asian, I connect with black, I connect with Indian. I connect with each culture.\"\n\nThe idea that black people's reaction to racism-and not the racism itself-is what must be addressed is an effective distraction that decenters the struggle of black people. It centers the comfort of white people, absolving white supremacy and indicting black rage as \"the problem.\"\n\nCelebrities like Common and Raven-Symone are but ambassadors of the growing New Black culture that Pharrell became the unwitting poster child for in his now-infamous Oprah interview. \"Upward mobility,\" sayeth the New Black, \" that is the promise of America and because I have achieved-you can, too.\" They conveniently romanticize their climb to wherever they are in their lives and careers, telling themselves that they got there via personal drive and ambition that is unique to them. But structural obstacles kept most of their peers stagnant in socio-economic standing; these stars achieved in spite of racism-not because it doesn't exist. So it is dangerous to put the onus on the oppressed people, as if you believe no one cared to climb the ladder until you came along. Poor public schools and overpriced housing mean that things aren't really designed for you and your peers to \"make it out.\" You can't be \"exceptional\" without being an exception.\n\nThe New Black perspective sounds like an old black pathology. Exceptionalism and respectability have never saved us from the oppressive weight of racism. We've always achieved greatness in a country that doesn't see value in blackness beyond a commodity; maintained dignity in a land that has consistently dehumanized and stigmatized who we are. White supremacy often insists that black people prove themselves exceptional just to share a table with white mediocrity. It is not for black people to extend a hand; it is for the privileged and the powerful to remove their boot from the community's collective neck. These celebrities seem to be disconnected from the pulse and spirit of many of their peers, but their voices resonate far and wide in pop culture. And more black celebrities should take the struggles of the community at least seriously enough to not offer condescension, rhetoric, and smug dismissals when confronted with the realities of race and racism. Those with the biggest pulpits can't continue to preach the gospel of positivity, condescension, and denial. It was deflecting when Bill Cosby gave his infamous \"Pound Cake speech\" in 2004 and it's deflecting now. It's an old routine.\n\nWhen you think about it, there isn't much \"new\" about New Blacks at all.\n\nstereowilliams@gmail.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "The Rebellious Rap Debut That Disrupted 'Safe' Black Culture\n\nHip-hop has no shortage of game-changing debuts. In 1989, De La Soul 's 3 Feet High and Rising announced the emergence of a quirky nerd rap sensibility just as the world was discovering gangsta rap; 15 years later, Kanye West 's The College Dropout announced a shift away from street hop toward hipster rap aesthetics. And long before those, the self-titled first album from Queens legends Run-D.M.C. marked the dawn of hip-hop's mainstream takeover. As such, Run-D.M.C. -which celebrated its 40th anniversary this week-was the beginning of an expansion on the idea of what it meant to be Black in the 1980s; an opening for street kids to assert themselves and insert their world into American popular culture.\n\nRun DMC's Joseph \"Run\" Simmons and Darryl \"D.M.C.\" McDaniels pose in Central Park, New York, 1984.\n\nRun-D.M.C. had been born out of the ambitions of Joey \"DJ Run\" Simmons, younger brother to rap promoter Russell and early understudy to the legendary Kurtis Blow. After a stint as Blow's kid DJ (known as \"DJ Run, Son of Kurtis Blow\"), Run convinced his brother to help him record his own demo for a song called \"Street Kid.\" He recruited neighborhood friend Darryl McDaniels to be his rhyme partner, and after they started rapping together in their hometown of Hollis, Queens, they met an aspiring DJ in Jason Mizell (who would later go by Jam Master Jay ). With the elder Simmons now pushing the trio he'd dubbed \"Run-D.M.C.,\" they landed a deal with Profile Records and released their debut double-release single \"It's Like That/Sucker MCs\" in late 1983. Lauded as the dawning of rap's first \"new school,\" that hit instantly set anticipation for their first LP.\n\nThe debut album from Run, Dee, and Jam Master Jay was a recalibration of rap music: What had previously been a singles-driven genre defined by mostly party songs was moving into more album-focused, sonically hard-hitting territory. Larry Smith's production was dark and aggressive compared to the disco sounds of earlier rap hits like The Sugarhill Gang's \"Rapper's Delight,\" and the subject matter took its cues from Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five's classic commentary track \"The Message.\" \"Rock Box\" announced the trio as genre-bending innovators (a full two years before \"Walk This Way,\" their chart-busting collaboration with Aerosmith ) and Jam Master Jay lionized the group's soon-to-be legendary turntablist. \"It's Like That\" dropped like an atom bomb; a sinister slice of Smith-produced sonic doom that made it clear that hip-hop was entering a new day.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"It showed that we had the big gold chain and the fancy car and that we were truly the superstars of the neighborhood, you know,\" D.M.C. recalled to NPR's Terry Gross last year. \"'Cause if you got a big chain and the other guy don't, you must be doing something. And, you know, it also brought a bad image to us because people that didn't know Run-D.M.C. before we had an album cover out thought we was just drug dealers because most of the drug dealers was wearing chains like that and driving in big cars, even before the rappers made it big.\"\n\nRun-D.M.C. wasn't the first major rap release of its era-six months earlier, the Brooklyn trio Whodini released their self-titled debut. But unlike Whodini, whose popularity would remain largely confined to the R&B charts, Run-D.M.C. would land on the Billboard 200 album chart en route to gold commercial status. It put the group on MTV, as the hard guitar licks of \"Rock Box\" were a natural fit for the still rock-driven network's video rotations. It put Run-D.M.C. at the forefront of a cultural zeitgeist, and it saved rap music from the realm of novelty.\n\nAmerican rap group Run DMC pose at the Grammy Awards in 1988.\n\n\"Before us,\" Jam-Master Jay told Spin in 1986, \"rap records was corny. Everything was soft. Nobody made no hard beat records. Everybody just wanted to sing, but they didn't know how to sing, so they'll just rap on the record. There was no real meaning to a rapper. [Afrika Bambaataa] and them was getting weak. Flash was getting weak. Everybody was telling me it was a fad. And before Run-D.M.C. came along, rap music could have been a fad.\"\n\nFurther, the success of Run-D.M.C. set the stage for the rise of Def Jam Recordings. Although the group itself was never signed to the legendary label, their breakthrough led to Simmons and producer Rick Rubin launching their imprint with the 1984 single \"It's Yours\" and landing a distribution deal with CBS Records. And the album cemented Smith as the foremost rap producer of the mid-1980s, with hits from the aforementioned Whodini and The Fat Boys also under his belt.\n\nBut Run-D.M.C. 's impact extended far beyond just musical spaces, breaking into American pop culture in a big way. About six months after the album dropped, The Cosby Show premiered on NBC, and would go on to become the most popular TV show of the decade, opening the gates for a wave of popular, family-friendly Black sitcoms. The weekly exploits of the Huxtable clan would be groundbreaking in its depiction of middle-class Black American lives, becoming a totem of sorts for the image of an upward-climbing post-Civil Rights generation of Black professionals. It's understandable if one views The Cosby Show and Run-D.M.C . as diametrically opposed-the rap group that mainstreamed hip-hop by embracing the street sensibilities of Black culture versus a sitcom that became a phenomenon by rejecting those same sensibilities.\n\nRun D.M.C. on American Bandstand in 1985.\n\nAt a time when so much of Black popular culture would be driven by a sense of safe accessibility, Run-D.M.C. led a wave of rap renegades whose look and sound seemed to be an affront to a generation embracing the suit-wearing sensibilities of then-contemporary R&B and the universal appeal of popular artists like Michael Jackson and Lionel Richie . The menace that some associated with Run-D.M.C.'s thunderous beats, fedoras, and non-smiling album cover was more implied than anything else, but it was a staunchly rebellious presentation at a time when \"crossing over\" was high currency.\n\nIn the landscape of aspirational '80s Black pop culture, Run-D.M.C.'s debut brought urban aesthetics to the mainstream. It was a harbinger of rap's rise in the second half of the decade, but more importantly, it highlighted a side of Blackness that wasn't beholden to respectability. Revisiting it 40 years later, it's clear that their debut altered Black pop culture in the 1980s while also announcing hip-hop's mainstreaming-though Run-D.M.C. themselves knew all along how massive it would be.\n\n\"I knew it was going to be a culture shock,\" Run said in 2018 . \"I knew it was more than just music with what we were coming with. It was the attitude, fashion, and the hip-hop coming together with something bigger.\"\n\nstereowilliams@gmail.com\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "The Rich History of Black Roller Skating Rinks-and Their Civil Rights Legacy\n\nUnited Skates , a 2019 documentary film highlighting the history of Black roller skating rinks, opens with a shot that is all-too-prescient for this summer of Black Lives Matter demonstrations : police sirens.\n\nAs Black families, many of them with children, wait to enter a roller skating rink , they are monitored by officers. Even at a recreational space long associated with nostalgia and good clean fun, the cops keep a close eye.\n\nBut then the doors to the rink open, and the audience is treated to a weekend night at the roller rink. Two men in matching neon camouflage pants skate in unison, one diving under the other's legs without breaking rhythm in a feat of intoxicating athleticism.\n\nAnother man spins once, then twice, then three and four times, spotting his turns like a ballet dancer on wheels. People drop to the floor in unison. Though the space is strictly guarded outside, inside it is a place of unbridled, infectious joy.\n\n\"The idea of the film's opening was to show as if you were backstage and then stepping out onto the floor,\" Dyana Winkler, one of the film's co-directors, said in an interview. \"We wanted to show what the outside world feels like, and how it shifts and becomes this magical place once you open the doors. You see cops out there, and then that all falls away and disappears as you enter. It's more colorful, more vivid, more clear.\"\n\nAlong with telling the triumphant history of Black roller skating rinks, a narrative deeply entrenched in the civil rights movement, Winkler and her co-director Tina Brown shed light on a sad future. Across the country, rinks have disappeared. In one scene, a graphic of the United States shows dots where locations used to be in all 50 states. As time ticks from 1980 on, those dots vanish.\n\n\"It looks like a constellation, and you can see the stars going out,\" Reggie \"Premier\" Brown, a 36-year-old Black roller skater from New York told The Daily Beast. Along with his wife Naadira and their children, Reggie's attempts to keep rinks in business anchor much of United Skates .\n\nReggie has been skating since he was 12 years old. His mother and uncles were avid skaters and they spent every Thursday going to \"Soul Nights\" in Chicago rinks.\n\n\"One thing I remember most of all was seeing a whole bunch of people who looked like me,\" Reggie said. \"The legacy and history of roller skating as it pertains to the African-American community is not only massive as far as influence, but also in the success of roller skating-that's been because of the consistent support of our community. Period. It's been that way because we had to fight so hard to get it.\"\n\nIn the documentary, elder skaters detail just what that struggle looked like. One man who experienced segregation in Chicago said that Black people were allowed one evening a week to head to the rink, called \"Soul Night.\" In Detroit, it was called \"Hell night.\"\n\nRinks were the site of many peaceful protests. One skater from Illinois named Reverend Koen speaks in the film about the KKK attacking picketers. The rink would later close. \"They would rather die than integrate,\" he says.\n\nLedger Smith, a semi-professional skater, is greeted by H. Carl Moultie, vice president of the D. C. branch of the NAACP, as he arrived by roller skates from Chicago to join the March on Washington, he is seen here in Washington, DC on August 27, 1963. Ledger left on August 17 and averaged between 70 and 80 miles a day.\n\nBut determined Black skaters found a metaphor in their attempts to break down barriers at rinks: keep one foot in front of the other. \"Forward forever and backwards never,\" Reverend Koen says.\n\nLedger Smith, known as \"Roller Man,\" skated 685 miles from Chicago to D.C. to attend the March on Washington , wearing a placard that read \"FREEDOM\" around his neck. He lost 10 pounds on the way and almost got run over by a racist driver in Fort Wayne, Indiana.\n\n\"He didn't do a single trick,\" Reggie told The Daily Beast. \"He was just persistent. Skating outside, those legs start to hurt. But he was rolling with purpose.\"\n\nAs explicit segregation ended, racism at white-owned rinks became more subtle. \"Black Nights\" was no longer an acceptable term, so people came up with other coded ways to describe it. One part of the film tracks the different names rinks gave to these evenings: \"MLK Night,\" \"Sepia Night,\" \"Soul Night,\" and \"Gospel Night.\"\n\n\"What's interesting is that audiences who are predominantly white get uncomfortable during that moment,\" Winkler said. \"You can hear gasps, or shock, or frustration. When you show the same scene to an audience of predominantly Black viewers, they laugh. They laugh because it's so obvious. 'Yup, that's another one.' For me, that was one of those eye-opening moments about how white America is so ignorant that we're still surprised by police brutality.\"\n\nReggie said he would not describe roller skating as an \"escape.\"\n\n\"This is my reality everyday, in the rink and outside of the rink, there is this constant fight for justice and equality,\" he said. \"On the floor, it's me, the music, and the wood. That's it. But even if the problems of my world temporarily cease to exist, at some point I'm going to unlace my skates and walk back at the door, and face the same adversities I did before heading in.\"\n\nThe summer before he went to college in North Carolina, Reggie spent every weekend at a rink. On Fridays, the clientele skewed white. More Black skaters showed up on Saturdays. Reggie would be there both nights.\n\n\"I remember on Friday, I practiced and then left the floor to go to the bathroom,\" he said. \"It was a really nice, redone bathroom. The next night, I was on the floor and had to use the bathroom again. So I went to the same bathroom, but the door was locked.\"\n\nReggie talked to the rink manager, who led Reggie down the hall to a different restroom. \"I opened the door and it was the absolute worst, most disgusting site you've ever seen in a bathroom,\" Reggie recalled. \"There was stuff on the walls, no soap, no paper towels.\"\n\nHe told the manager that just the night before he used the cleaner bathroom on the other end of the hall. Why wasn't it opened on Saturdays?\n\n\"The manager said, 'On Saturdays, people mess with the bathrooms so we close that one and use this instead,\" Reggie explained. \"That's the moment you start to realize, oh this is the reality. This place is meant to be enjoyable, but they shut down one bathroom and open up another. I don't think it gets more racial than that. There's no excuse for something like that.\"\n\nNaadira Brown, Reggie's wife, has also skated her entire life. They build a roller rink in the living room for their children, using wood from Home Depot as the flooring. \"For us and roller skating, we don't need a special time or a special reason, situation, or crisis to do it,\" Naadira said. \"We want to do it, and we love it.\"\n\nThis spring, an ebullient TikTok went viral featuring an actress named Ana Coto rolling down a suburban Los Angeles street wearing bell bottoms and a megawatt smile. In interviews, Coto cited the Black history of roller skating as an inspiration . (As Digital Trends noted, she is of Puerto Rican and Cuban descent.)\n\nHer popularity helped spur a mainstream interest in roller skates, with companies reporting a rise in sales. On Twitter, many bemoaned the lack of skates in stock, a sign that they had already been scooped up by wannabe roller girls and boys.\n\nNBC News called skates a \" hot new must-have \" and Buzzfeed declared the activity \" back in a big way .\"\n\nBlack roller skaters like the Browns say the activity is for everyone as long as they learn the rich backstory of the pastime.\n\n\"Hey, we were skating all this time,\" Naadira said. \"This is not new. It's not 'reemerging.' Even a simple Google search might have helped [news] writers be a little more factual. There is definitely much more recent history. Skating hasn't been dead since the disco era.\"\n\n\"My mom skates, I skate,\" Reggie added. \"All of my children skate. That's multiple generations. When 'trends' like this happen, it indirectly takes credit away from the source that allowed for [roller skating] to survive.\"\n\nFor her part, Ana Coto has spent time in the past two weeks protesting in support of Black Lives Matter and posting historical tidbits about Ledger Smith to her 65,000 followers.  (Her Instagram bio reads, \"Don't hate, roller-skate.\")\n\nRoller skaters at a Chicago rink\n\n\"Roller skating has opened my circle of friends, increased the size and diversity of it,\" Coto said. \"It's given me so much richness, sure, but also opportunities to learn.\"\n\nCoto says \"it's clear\" on her social media that (pre-pandemic) she visited roller rinks that are \"both predominantly Black and predominantly white.\"\n\n\"Roller skating is a parallel to life,\" she added. \"You're not just immediately good at life, you have to try and fall and fail. And you also try to balance and communicate, engage with people who inspire you, engage with people who frustrated you. You find a way..\"\n\nCoto does not think she should be credited for any \"resurgence\" of roller skating in popular culture. \"It wasn't just me,\" she said. \"TikTok is a very powerful character in this story too. I just learned about this succulent that has these little flowers on the leaves. Just one little flower can sprout this huge new succulent in a matter of days. Some things do catch and spread like that.\"\n\nCoto believes there is \"so much space\" for new skaters. \"I welcome them all,\" she said. \"Most of the community does. But of course I understand that people don't want Black culture to be erased. It has been time and time again.\"\n\n\"Roller skating is for everyone's enjoyment,\" Reggie said. \"One of the biggest things you can do is learn the history. I've seen articles that have said roller skating was irrelevant since the '70s. OK, so what have I been doing for the last 20 years? No, it hasn't been irrelevant. Roller skating has continued to survive because of the African-American community and our ability to open up the culture to others who want to learn it.\"\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "The Rebellious Rap Debut That Disrupted 'Safe' Black Culture\n\nHip-hop has no shortage of game-changing debuts. In 1989, De La Soul 's 3 Feet High and Rising announced the emergence of a quirky nerd rap sensibility just as the world was discovering gangsta rap; 15 years later, Kanye West 's The College Dropout announced a shift away from street hop toward hipster rap aesthetics. And long before those, the self-titled first album from Queens legends Run-D.M.C. marked the dawn of hip-hop's mainstream takeover. As such, Run-D.M.C. -which celebrated its 40th anniversary this week-was the beginning of an expansion on the idea of what it meant to be Black in the 1980s; an opening for street kids to assert themselves and insert their world into American popular culture.\n\nRun DMC's Joseph \"Run\" Simmons and Darryl \"D.M.C.\" McDaniels pose in Central Park, New York, 1984.\n\nRun-D.M.C. had been born out of the ambitions of Joey \"DJ Run\" Simmons, younger brother to rap promoter Russell and early understudy to the legendary Kurtis Blow. After a stint as Blow's kid DJ (known as \"DJ Run, Son of Kurtis Blow\"), Run convinced his brother to help him record his own demo for a song called \"Street Kid.\" He recruited neighborhood friend Darryl McDaniels to be his rhyme partner, and after they started rapping together in their hometown of Hollis, Queens, they met an aspiring DJ in Jason Mizell (who would later go by Jam Master Jay ). With the elder Simmons now pushing the trio he'd dubbed \"Run-D.M.C.,\" they landed a deal with Profile Records and released their debut double-release single \"It's Like That/Sucker MCs\" in late 1983.

      "text": "The Rich History of Black Roller Skating Rinks-and Their Civil Rights Legacy\n\nUnited Skates , a 2019 documentary film highlighting the history of Black roller skating rinks, opens with a shot that is all-too-prescient for this summer of Black Lives Matter demonstrations : police sirens.\n\nAs Black families, many of them with children, wait to enter a roller skating rink , they are monitored by officers. Even at a recreational space long associated with nostalgia and good clean fun, the cops keep a close eye.\n\nBut then the doors to the rink open, and the audience is treated to a weekend night at the roller rink. Two men in matching neon camouflage pants skate in unison, one diving under the other's legs without breaking rhythm in a feat of intoxicating athleticism.\n\nAnother man spins once, then twice, then three and four times, spotting his turns like a ballet dancer on wheels. People drop to the floor in unison. Though the space is strictly guarded outside, inside it is a place of unbridled, infectious joy.\n\n\"The idea of the film's opening was to show as if you were backstage and then stepping out onto the floor,\" Dyana Winkler, one of the film's co-directors, said in an interview. \"We wanted to show what the outside world feels like, and how it shifts and becomes this magical place once you open the doors. You see cops out there, and then that all falls away and disappears as you enter. It's more colorful, more vivid, more clear.\"\n\nAlong with telling the triumphant history of Black roller skating rinks, a narrative deeply entrenched in the civil rights movement, Winkler and her co-director Tina Brown shed light on a sad future. Across the country, rinks have disappeared. In one scene, a graphic of the United States shows dots where locations used to be in all 50 states. As time ticks from 1980 on, those dots vanish.\n\n\"It looks like a constellation, and you can see the stars going out,\" Reggie \"Premier\" Brown, a 36-year-old Black roller skater from New York told The Daily Beast. Along with his wife Naadira and their children, Reggie's attempts to keep rinks in business anchor much of United Skates .\n\nReggie has been skating since he was 12 years old. His mother and uncles were avid skaters and they spent every Thursday going to \"Soul Nights\" in Chicago rinks.\n\n\"One thing I remember most of all was seeing a whole bunch of people who looked like me,\" Reggie said. \"The legacy and history of roller skating as it pertains to the African-American community is not only massive as far as influence, but also in the success of roller skating-that's been because of the consistent support of our community. Period. It's been that way because we had to fight so hard to get it.\"\n\nIn the documentary, elder skaters detail just what that struggle looked like. One man who experienced segregation in Chicago said that Black people were allowed one evening a week to head to the rink, called \"Soul Night.\" In Detroit, it was called \"Hell night.\"\n\nRinks were the site of many peaceful protests. One skater from Illinois named Reverend Koen speaks in the film about the KKK attacking picketers. The rink would later close. \"They would rather die than integrate,\" he says.\n\nLedger Smith, a semi-professional skater, is greeted by H. Carl Moultie, vice president of the D. C. branch of the NAACP, as he arrived by roller skates from Chicago to join the March on Washington, he is seen here in Washington, DC on August 27, 1963. Ledger left on August 17 and averaged between 70 and 80 miles a day.\n\nBut determined Black skaters found a metaphor in their attempts to break down barriers at rinks: keep one foot in front of the other. \"Forward forever and backwards never,\" Reverend Koen says.\n\nLedger Smith, known as \"Roller Man,\" skated 685 miles from Chicago to D.C. to attend the March on Washington , wearing a placard that read \"FREEDOM\" around his neck. He lost 10 pounds on the way and almost got run over by a racist driver in Fort Wayne, Indiana.\n\n\"He didn't do a single trick,\" Reggie told The Daily Beast. \"He was just persistent. Skating outside, those legs start to hurt. But he was rolling with purpose.\"\n\nAs explicit segregation ended, racism at white-owned rinks became more subtle. \"Black Nights\" was no longer an acceptable term, so people came up with other coded ways to describe it. One part of the film tracks the different names rinks gave to these evenings: \"MLK Night,\" \"Sepia Night,\" \"Soul Night,\" and \"Gospel Night.\"\n\n\"What's interesting is that audiences who are predominantly white get uncomfortable during that moment,\" Winkler said. \"You can hear gasps, or shock, or frustration. When you show the same scene to an audience of predominantly Black viewers, they laugh. They laugh because it's so obvious. 'Yup, that's another one.' For me, that was one of those eye-opening moments about how white America is so ignorant that we're still surprised by police brutality.\"\n\nReggie said he would not describe roller skating as an \"escape.\"\n\n\"This is my reality everyday, in the rink and outside of the rink, there is this constant fight for justice and equality,\" he said. \"On the floor, it's me, the music, and the wood. That's it. But even if the problems of my world temporarily cease to exist, at some point I'm going to unlace my skates and walk back at the door, and face the same adversities I did before heading in.\"\n\nThe summer before he went to college in North Carolina, Reggie spent every weekend at a rink. On Fridays, the clientele skewed white. More Black skaters showed up on Saturdays. Reggie would be there both nights.\n\n\"I remember on Friday, I practiced and then left the floor to go to the bathroom,\" he said. \"It was a really nice, redone bathroom. The next night, I was on the floor and had to use the bathroom again. So I went to the same bathroom, but the door was locked.\"\n\nReggie talked to the rink manager, who led Reggie down the hall to a different restroom. \"I opened the door and it was the absolute worst, most disgusting site you've ever seen in a bathroom,\" Reggie recalled. \"There was stuff on the walls, no soap, no paper towels.\"\n\nHe told the manager that just the night before he used the cleaner bathroom on the other end of the hall. Why wasn't it opened on Saturdays?\n\n\"The manager said, 'On Saturdays, people mess with the bathrooms so we close that one and use this instead,\" Reggie explained. \"That's the moment you start to realize, oh this is the reality. This place is meant to be enjoyable, but they shut down one bathroom and open up another. I don't think it gets more racial than that. There's no excuse for something like that.\"\n\nNaadira Brown, Reggie's wife, has also skated her entire life. They build a roller rink in the living room for their children, using wood from Home Depot as the flooring. \"For us and roller skating, we don't need a special time or a special reason, situation, or crisis to do it,\" Naadira said. \"We want to do it, and we love it.\"\n\nThis spring, an ebullient TikTok went viral featuring an actress named Ana Coto rolling down a suburban Los Angeles street wearing bell bottoms and a megawatt smile. In interviews, Coto cited the Black history of roller skating as an inspiration . (As Digital Trends noted, she is of Puerto Rican and Cuban descent.)\n\nHer popularity helped spur a mainstream interest in roller skates, with companies reporting a rise in sales. On Twitter, many bemoaned the lack of skates in stock, a sign that they had already been scooped up by wannabe roller girls and boys.\n\nNBC News called skates a \" hot new must-have \" and Buzzfeed declared the activity \" back in a big way .\"\n\nBlack roller skaters like the Browns say the activity is for everyone as long as they learn the rich backstory of the pastime.\n\n\"Hey, we were skating all this time,\" Naadira said. \"This is not new. It's not 'reemerging.' Even a simple Google search might have helped [news] writers be a little more factual. There is definitely much more recent history. Skating hasn't been dead since the disco era.\"\n\n\"My mom skates, I skate,\" Reggie added. \"All of my children skate. That's multiple generations. When 'trends' like this happen, it indirectly takes credit away from the source that allowed for [roller skating] to survive.\"\n\nFor her part, Ana Coto has spent time in the past two weeks protesting in support of Black Lives Matter and posting historical tidbits about Ledger Smith to her 65,000 followers.  (Her Instagram bio reads, \"Don't hate, roller-skate.\")\n\nRoller skaters at a Chicago rink\n\n\"Roller skating has opened my circle of friends, increased the size and diversity of it,\" Coto said. \"It's given me so much richness, sure, but also opportunities to learn.\"\n\nCoto says \"it's clear\" on her social media that (pre-pandemic) she visited roller rinks that are \"both predominantly Black and predominantly white.\"\n\n\"Roller skating is a parallel to life,\" she added. \"You're not just immediately good at life, you have to try and fall and fail. And you also try to balance and communicate, engage with people who inspire you, engage with people who frustrated you. You find a way..\"\n\nCoto does not think she should be credited for any \"resurgence\" of roller skating in popular culture. \"It wasn't just me,\" she said. \"TikTok is a very powerful character in this story too. I just learned about this succulent that has these little flowers on the leaves. Just one little flower can sprout this huge new succulent in a matter of days. Some things do catch and spread like that.\"\n\nCoto believes there is \"so much space\" for new skaters. \"I welcome them all,\" she said. \"Most of the community does. But of course I understand that people don't want Black culture to be erased. It has been time and time again.\"\n\n\"Roller skating is for everyone's enjoyment,\" Reggie said. \"One of the biggest things you can do is learn the history. I've seen articles that have said roller skating was irrelevant since the '70s. OK, so what have I been doing for the last 20 years? No, it hasn't been irrelevant. Roller skating has continued to survive because of the African-American community and our ability to open up the culture to others who want to learn it.\"\n\nGot a tip?

Last month, British Home Secretary Amber Rudd resigned amid an escalating scandal over how thousands of Caribbean immigrants who have lived in Britain for decades are facing discrimination and deportation despite having legally immigrated to Britain after World War II. Known as the Windrush generation, many of the immigrants never formalized their citizenship after they immigrated from former British colonies. Now, following harsh new anti-immigration laws enacted in 2012, many of them are facing eviction, unemployment and the possibility of deportation. The British government has admitted that more than 60 people may have been wrongfully deported. We speak with Gabrielle Bruney, editor for Esquire. Her new piece is \"The Royal Wedding Celebrated the Contributions of Black Britons: But it comes amid a scandal rooted in the British government's mistreatment of Caribbean people.\" We are also joined by Priya Gopal, a university lecturer in the Faculty of English at the University of Cambridge.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: I'd like to bring in Gabrielle Bruney, editor for Esquire , based in Brooklyn. You recently wrote a piece for Esquire titled \"The Royal Wedding Celebrated the Contributions of Black Britons: But it comes amid a scandal rooted in the British government's mistreatment of Caribbean people.\" What is that scandal?\n\nGABRIELLE BRUNEY : Well, that would be the Windrush scandal, which boils down to the government treating British Caribbeans, who are in the country legally-legal citizens-as if they were illegal immigrants. And in the U.K. at the moment, treating someone as if they're an illegal immigrant means treating them very harshly-you know, depriving them of housing, their job potentially, and perhaps even deporting them.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And why is it called the Windrush generation?\n\nGABRIELLE BRUNEY : Well, it's named that for the boat that carried the first group of this generation of Caribbean people to the U.K. The boat was called the Empire Windrush .\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And this migration started when? Can you give us a little bit of the history of it?\n\nGABRIELLE BRUNEY : Sure. Well, the Empire Windrush docked in the U.K. in 1948. To give an idea of the extent to which these people were part of the British Empire, were British subjects, the Evening Standard from 1948, with a picture of the ship on it, it said \"Welcome Home.\" You know, that was the headline. So, it was a real sense that these people are part of our country. And the wave of migration continued until about 1971.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : With labor very much needed and wanted and encouraged by the British government.\n\nGABRIELLE BRUNEY : Yes. They were augmenting the post-World War II workforce. They were actually invited. So not only were they already British citizens, they were invited to come to, you know, the motherland to work.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Let's go to the British Labour MP David Lammy last month blasting former Home Secretary Amber Rudd in the House of Commons about the Windrush scandal.\n\nDAVID LAMMY : The relationship between this country and the West Indies and Caribbean is inextricable. The first British ships arrived in the Caribbean in 1623. And despite slavery, despite colonization, 25,000 Caribbeans served in the First World War and Second World War alongside British troops. When my parents and their generation arrived in this country on the Nationality Act 1948, they arrived here as British citizens. It is inhumane and cruel for so many of that Windrush generation to have suffered so long in this condition and for the secretary of state only to have made a statement today on this issue.\n\nCan she explain how many have been deported? She suggested earlier that she would ask the high commissioners. It is her department that has deported them. She should know the number. Can she tell the House how many have been detained as prisoners in their own country? Can she tell the House how many have been denied health under the National Health Service? How many have denied pensions? How many have lost their job? This is a day of national shame. And it has come about because of a hostile environment policy that was begun under her prime minister.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, that is British Labour MP David Lammy, deeply impassioned about this issue. I mean, some people being jailed or deported who have lived in Britain for over half a century?\n\nGABRIELLE BRUNEY : Yes. There was one publicized case of a man who had cancer, and because he was being treated as an undocumented person, he was denied cancer treatment by the state healthcare. And people were actually deported and threatened with deportation, and lived with that looming over their heads. One man said that he was preparing to commit suicide if they actually went through with it and deported him to Jamaica.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Talk about your own family, when they came, and their experience.\n\nGABRIELLE BRUNEY : Well, I'm the child of Caribbean immigrants who grew up under British rule. My mother grew up in Dominica singing \"God Save the Queen\" every day, with the queen on her money and her notebooks. And my grandparents made the decision to come to America, but others in my family decided to go to the U.K., so I have cousins and relatives there. So it's very easy for me to imagine how, if my grandparents made a different decision, my parents could have been affected by the Windrush, and I could have been affected by the Windrush, because there's not birthright citizenship in the U.K., so if your parents are decided to have been illegal immigrants, now you're in danger.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So talk about your thoughts and feelings over this weekend and the massive attention paid to the royal wedding.\n\nGABRIELLE BRUNEY : Well, it was very-it made me very happy to see that-you know, it is somewhat vacant symbolism, but that's nice enough, that black people were being celebrated by this wedding. I think that the black American contributions were a lot more visible, perhaps because we are American, and, you know, the bishop is an American, and the songs, \"This Little Light of Mine,\" \"Stand By Me,\" are American songs. But there were contributions by black Brits and by black Brits of Caribbean origin. So, Sheku Kanneh-Mason is half-Antiguan. And-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The 19-year-old cellist.\n\nGABRIELLE BRUNEY : Exactly.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The first black musician to win the BBC classical music competition in its history.\n\nGABRIELLE BRUNEY : Exactly. And his father is from Antigua. And the Kingdom Choir is a choir based in South East London, which is a Caribbean bastion in London. So, you know, it was subtle, but there was that messaging of, you know, \"You are part of this empire, you are part of this crown,\" whatever that might mean to individual subjects.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You had this scandal in December where one of the royals-what, Princess Michael of Kent or something-wore a Black Sambo brooch on her suit.\n\nGABRIELLE BRUNEY : Yes. Well, she wore that to her first meeting with Meghan Markle, so, you know, which was so alarming. I mean, I personally was wondering what Meghan Markle was getting herself into, marrying into this particular institution, you know, because the monarchy does tend to be an institution that changes people who join it. It doesn't adapt to them. So, this wedding was at least some signaling that they are trying to move towards a more diverse image.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : She was later forced to apologize for that.\n\nGABRIELLE BRUNEY : Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : But on this whole issue of should the monarchy be abolished, let's go to Priya and then to you. Priya Gopal, what do you feel?\n\nPRIYA GOPAL : Well, I think it seems clear that having an institution which embodies both feudal privilege and accrues so much private wealth and plays a political role in this country, whether it admits it or not, really has no place in a society which should be seeking to be just and fair, equal and democratic. The monarchy is not a democratic institution. It never can be. And so, I think that, absolutely, if Britain is to consider itself a democratic country, the monarchy should be abolished. There is absolutely no basis for any single family to accrue so much wealth, privilege and, frankly, political power to itself. The British Republicans tend to make the case on the basis that it is anachronistic. As I have said, I don't think that is the only reason to abolish it, but it certainly is incompatible with any country that seeks to be democratic.\n\nAnd let me just add one other thing here. Meghan Markle has been able to join this family on terms which are not available to other people who are marrying foreigners. Under the hostile environment that has been created by the Conservative government for immigration in this country, there are now minimum salary requirements before somebody who is a British citizen can marry someone from outside. And I personally know, from students, that people who don't earn the equivalent of a minimum of $25,000 can't bring their loved ones into this country. So Meghan Markle is actually able to bypass a lot of the constraints and oppressive structures that other people have to struggle with, and that seems to me fundamentally unequal and undemocratic. And we need to understand that the hostile environment that other immigrants face in this country, which is only getting worse with Brexit, is not something that she is going to have to deal with, precisely because of undemocratic privilege.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And Gabrielle Bruney?\n\nGABRIELLE BRUNEY : Well, I'm not sure whether or not the monarchy should be abolished. But here in the U.S., we don't have one, and yet it seems we're always trying to create one. You know, what is Camelot and the Kennedys, if not our own attempts at monarchy building? So I think there is potentially some value in having a figurehead, if only so that the real government does not then become, you know, a Bush-Clinton dynasty situation.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, it's interesting you say that. Meghan Markle is a Noam Chomsky fan. She posted a photo of Noam's Chomsky's book, Who Rules the World? on her Instagram page last summer. Chomsky told The Guardian , quote, \"I've heard about the marriage, but didn't know about Markle's interests. Naturally pleased to hear it. Sounds as though she may, for many reasons, shake up the royal family.\" When asked about the monarchy, Chomsky has quoted the philosopher Peter Slezak, who said, quote, \"Royalty serves a useful purpose, he [Slezak] said: the pomp and ceremony helps undermine respect for state authority.\"\n\nWe want to thank you both for being with us. Gabrielle Bruney, we'll link to your piece in Esquire . And we want to thank Priya Gopal of Cambridge University in England.\n\nThis is Democracy Now!

We begin with an address by world-renowned abolitionist, author and activist Angela Davis on Malcolm's legacy, attacks on the teaching of Black history by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and more. \"This is a time to reflect deeply on the long struggle for liberation,\" Davis said. \"And Malcolm asked us to keep our eyes on the future, future worlds, radical democratic futures for all beings who inhabit this planet.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nMalcolm X was born 98 years ago today in Omaha, Nebraska, on May 19, 1925. Malcolm was assassinated just 39 years later, on February 21st, 1965, when he was standing at the podium before a crowd in Harlem's Audubon Ballroom. His wife, Betty Shabazz, pregnant with twins, and his four daughters, age 6, 4, 2, and 5 months, were in the ballroom looking on.\n\nIn February, the family of Malcolm X filed a $100 million wrongful death lawsuit against the FBI , the CIA , New York City and state, and the NYPD and the District Attorney's Office for concealing evidence of their involvement in Malcolm X's 1965 assassination.\n\nWell, today we spend the hour remembering Malcolm X. We begin with Angela Davis, the world-renowned abolitionist, author, activist, distinguished professor emerita at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Her many books include Abolition. Feminism. Now. , Freedom Is a Constant Struggle and Are Prisons Obsolete?\n\nEarlier this year, she gave the keynote address at a February 21st event at the Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center, housed in the former Audubon Ballroom. Professor Davis spoke about Malcolm's legacy, as well as the increasing attacks on the teaching of Black history by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and others. She began by referencing the actor Ossie Davis, who gave the eulogy at Malcolm X's funeral, describing him as, quote, \"our own Black shining prince!\"\n\nANGELA DAVIS : Ossie said the following in Malcolm's eulogy. \"Last year, from Africa, he wrote these words\" - Malcolm wrote these words - \"to a friend. 'My journey,' he says, 'is almost ended, and I have a much broader scope than when I started out, which I believe will add new life and dimension to our struggle for freedom and honor and dignity in the States. I am writing these things so that you will know for a fact the tremendous sympathy and support we have among the African States for our Human Rights struggle. The main thing,'\" he wrote, \"'is that we keep a United Front wherein our most valuable time and energy will not be wasted fighting each other.'\"\n\nMalcolm's words and his trajectory as a movement leader and a movement participant are as valuable today as they were six decades ago. They resonate in powerful ways, because the change Malcolm was calling for, the change we were calling for, has not yet happened. And therefore, Malcolm's vision cannot be relegated to the past. His vision still helps us to imagine the future we want to see.\n\nNow, official United States narratives of past history always attempt to assimilate demands for radical transformation into a neat story of progress and triumph. The very fact that Black freedom struggles came to be compressed and constricted by the rubric \"civil rights movement\" - and, of course, the civil rights movement was important, but that was not the entire story of the Black freedom movement. And that, in itself, is indicative of this assimilationist tendency, the fact that we ourselves often refer to the movement for Black freedom as only a civil rights movement.\n\nDuring the 1960s, Malcolm emphasized the need to expand our vision. He told us that it was not only about civil rights, the rights that can be accorded to individuals by a single nation-state and its government. Our vision needed to be broader. It had to move, Malcolm said, across the borders of nation-states. It had to be transnational. It had to be international. The framework that Malcolm urged us to use was human rights.\n\nNow, Malcolm's trajectory, and his insistence on radical frameworks, has never been easily assimilable into a narrative of U.S. history as one in which increasing numbers of people get to participate in the circle of justice, equality and freedom. And I'm thinking about the way in which Dr. King's image has been entirely assimilated into a capitalist narrative, which is not to say that Dr. King represented those ideas, but this is the official narrative, the official representation.\n\nNow, Malcolm's vision, from the very outset, or at least from the time he made the pilgrimage to Mecca, was an international vision, including not only people in the U.S. and not only Black people, but people all over the world. And I tell you that I treasure the story that was told to me by Yuri Kochiyama about hosting a meeting in her Harlem apartment, where Malcolm met with survivors of the bombing, the atomic bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima. And there's also a photograph of Yuri leaning over Malcolm's body in this place, shortly after he was assassinated. And I often wonder: Why is it that that photograph is not circulated more widely? You know, why didn't we see Yuri represented in Spike's film? ...\n\nThis is a time when we can reflect on what we should call the long struggle for freedom, the long struggle for freedom conducted by and on behalf of Black people in the Americas, the struggle against slavery, the struggle against segregation and secondhand citizenship, and, of course, the struggle of Africans against the slave trade and colonialism and neocolonialism. This is a time to reflect deeply on the long struggle for liberation that has already spanned multiple centuries. It is also a time to reflect on how we might accelerate that struggle in order to guarantee that those who have been denied entrance into the circle of freedom might not only be admitted, but by recognizing their struggles, their collective, multigenerational vision, it might be possible to imagine future worlds. And Malcolm asked us to keep our eyes on the future, future worlds, radical democratic futures for all beings who inhabit this planet.\n\nAnd so, in the spirit of Malcolm's contributions, I want us to ponder a couple of questions. How has it actually been possible for Black people and our allies, including in the first place Indigenous people - how has it been possible to remain committed over so many centuries, over so many generations, to the struggle for freedom? That is phenomenal, that each generation has passed on that impulse to fight for freedom to the next. And oftentimes, even when we thought the flames had been extinguished, we have a Black Lives Matter movement erupting.\n\nAnd so, I think that we should acknowledge the phenomenal quality of Black culture, Black political culture, Black music, because where have we learned to cultivate that impulse for freedom? I mean, that is - that is the reason why we observe Black history. You know, Black history is not just because there are Black people in various parts of the world. It's about what Black people have offered to people all over the world. And that is the desire, the cultivation of the desire to keep on struggling for freedom. It is in the art. It is the very heart of the music. And that is why Black music is known by people all over this planet.\n\nNow, there's also the question, which we have to acknowledge: Why is it that racism has persisted for so long? And why has it become so naturalized that its proponents often believe that what we refer to as racism is the natural destiny of the world? Now, Malcolm understood the deeply ideological character of racism. And I use the term \"ideology\" to mean the way that we humans imagine ourselves in relation to the conditions of our existence. Malcolm understood that ideology, even when you define it as the source of illusory ideas about such conditions, that ideology's role is precisely to make the conditions of our lives appear to be normal. And as a matter of fact, the more normal something appears to be, the more likely it is to be produced in and through ideology.\n\nThis is the point that abolitionists make about the seeming permanence of jails and prisons, about the permanence of police, about the so-called school resource officers, about the child protective - so-called Child Protective Services that Dorothy Roberts calls the family policing system. But thanks to the way in which Malcolm taught us to engage in the kind of radical reflection on that which is ideological, we know that we can envision life beyond prisons and police. We can envision life beyond capitalism.\n\nNow, Malcolm used his remarkable oratory and his phenomenal sense of humor to trouble our sense of comfort in a world that was predicated, that is predicated, remains predicated, on white superiority. Malcolm helped us to understand how we internalize those ideological assumptions, and how their persistence depends on all of us doing the work of prisons, the work of the police, the work of capitalism, white supremacy.\n\nNow, I had the opportunity to hear Malcolm in person. And as a matter of fact, one of the things I'm most proud about, connected to my time in college, was the fact that Malcolm came in April of 1963 to speak at Brandeis University, and because there was only a handful of Black students there, I got to meet him. I was - all of the Black students got to meet him and to spend time with him. But that's another story.\n\nYou know, I wanted to point out that there are - there are signs, there is evidence, that we can challenge that which is ideologically imposed. And I'm thinking about one area that we've seen a lot of change in over a relatively short period of time. And that is the demystification of the gender binary. Yes. I mean, who would have ever thought 20 years ago that we would be acknowledging, again, the ideological character of gender, that we would be attentive to pronouns? No, who would have ever imagined that? And I think it's important to recognize it not only in terms of the advances that the trans movement has made, but also is evidence that we can dismantle other institutions whose seeming permanence is also a product of ideology.\n\nAnd even as we develop the capacity to think about the damage wrought by racism, we often take shortcuts, and we capitulate to heteropatriarchal assumptions that the targets of racism are primarily Black men, or ethnocentric assumptions that racism affects exclusively Black people. Ron DeSantis - and, Ben, thank you for asking us to reflect on what is going on with that - don't let me characterize him, but -\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER : Go on. We're family. [inaudible]\n\nANGELA DAVIS : But I just heard him - well, OK, I'll tell you that I just heard him - I think it was yesterday, maybe it was the day before - making fun of the fact that queer theory was included under the rubric of the Black studies Advanced Placement course that you were talking about. And, you know, he's pretty stupid. You know, one of the things you learn - one of the things you learn, when you really try to engage in a serious process of learning, you learn that the more you learn, the less you know. You know, you learn all - you learn that there's always so much more to learn. And this governor, this - OK.\n\nAUDIENCE MEMBER : We're family. Come on.\n\nANGELA DAVIS : Absolutely, absolutely. So, but, you know - and what does he say? I guess he also - they also removed Kimberlé Crenshaw, so you're not allowed to talk about intersectionality. But I was just going to say that we have to think about the intersectionality of racism. You know, it's not just about identities.\n\nAnd because this is a historical moment, when we are called upon to comprehend the structural, the systemic, the institutional character of racism, and then - OK, I'm just going to call them counterrevolutionaries, right? Because it reminds me so much of the period of Radical Reconstruction and the responses to it, and following W. E. B. Du Bois, I'm just going to call them the counterrevolutionaries, because they are trying to prevent the progressive developments from transforming our lives. And all he can think about is wokeness. I mean, he doesn't even know what wokeness means. But he thinks that Black studies will cause white children to feel bad about themselves. I think he must be talking about himself.\n\nBut in any event, the reason we are witnessing these uproars right now, from DeSantis's strategies in Florida to the actions of the College Board, is that education is integrally related to social change. And this is something Malcolm taught us, both through his words and through his actions, you know, thanks to Malcolm's decision to teach himself in prison. Vast numbers of incarcerated people do the hard work of learning, often learning how to read, as Malcolm did, but certainly learning how to use their intellects. And as a matter of fact, there's probably more intellectual greatness behind bars now than in any other place.\n\nWe're on the verge of substantial shifts in the way people think about race and racism. And those who want to prevent these shifts from happening are frantically trying to turn back the clock. At least 36 states have adopted or introduced laws that impede educational projects about race and racism. And here in New York, at the end of 2021, Republican lawmakers introduced bills that prevent public schools from providing instruction on structural racism. Even in the most progressive states - and, you know, I come from California, and most of the times I'm happy to say that I come from California, because, well, first of all, I live in Oakland, and Oakland celebrates May 19th, Oakland and Berkeley. Malcolm X's birthday is an official holiday in both of those cities. But even in the most progressive states that we see efforts to restrict and confine instruction. California is also, I think, the only state with a statewide ethnic studies curriculum. But there have been major efforts, vociferous efforts, to prevent the inclusion of Palestine and Palestinians and Palestinian Americans in the curriculum.\n\nAmidst all of the pain and suffering produced by the COVID pandemic - and we're not that far removed from that era - this new collective awareness of the structural character of racism was generated. Not that it was a new way of thinking about racism. Scholars like W. E. B. Du Bois pointed this out scores of decades ago. Malcolm talked about institutional change. But the change, as many people have recognized over the decades, is one that involves not so much of a shift in subjective attitudes, although that's definitely welcome, but it's about structural transformation. It's not about white people not liking Black people or Indigenous people or Latinx people. And that will change if there is structural change. But we can treat racism as a character defect or a character flaw and leave the entire systematic structure of racism intact. You know, they talk about racism without the racists.\n\nBut in the spirit of all of the freedom movements, that I tried to evoke at the beginning of my presentation, all of the freedom movements that have preceded us, let us vow never to forget the summer of 2020. It was only two-and-a-half years ago, and we're already treating it like - yeah, like it's a relic of history. It was two-and-a-half years ago when we were deep in the throes of the worst crisis most of us can remember, and we collectively experienced the police lynching, the police murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor and all of the others that have been referred to. This occurred in the process of also recognizing that communities that were already subject to racism were the ones who were suffering most from the COVID pandemic - a new awareness of the structural racism within the healthcare system, within the privatized healthcare system, within the capitalist healthcare system. Actually, not so much a new awareness, but a collective attentiveness to an idea that activists, scholar-activists have been insisting on since the era of Radical Reconstruction in the aftermath of slavery.\n\nAnd there have been those who have pointed out that racism is connected to capitalism, that capitalism is at its core racial capitalism, and not only here in the U.S. Capitalism was produced by colonialism and slavery. But, finally, it seemed, people seemed to get it. Racism does not emanate from the fact that white people don't like Black people or Indigenous or Latinx or Asian people. It is produced and reproduced structurally, systemically, institutionally. And this was a kind of collective aha moment. And we should never forget that.\n\nThis is why more people poured out into the streets of this country than ever before in the history. This is why people joined the mobilizations. This is why more white people joined all of the mobilizations. And people were out in the streets, even though we did not yet know then how COVID was transmitted. Millions of people poured out into the streets at the risk of their own lives. Demonstrating this new awareness became more important than the lives of individuals - the most remarkable moment in our recent history, maybe even in the history of this country. And this is why DeSantis and others are excising examination of this movement from the school curriculum.\n\nAnd so, the stage was set for us to attempt to accomplish what should have been done in the 19th century in the immediate aftermath of slavery. And it seemed that a good majority of people in this country, people of all racial and ethnic backgrounds, seemed to realize this. To overlay the political context, all of this was happening during the presidency of the person whose name shall not be pronounced during our meeting this evening. Thus the counterrevolution. Thus the attack against critical race theory, which is a serious interdisciplinary field founded on the work of those who were attempting many years ago to understand the way structural racism expressed itself through the law.\n\nSo, those of you who are interested in history will be utterly struck by all of the parallels between the reaction to Radical Reconstruction, 1867 to 1877, and what we are currently witnessing. The police murder of Tyre Nichols in the very same city in which Dr. King was assassinated punctuates the message that racism is structural. Awareness of racism is not about making white children feel guilty. It is about recognizing the deep structures of racism in all of our institutions, regardless of who the individual perpetrators might be. It is a machine. It is a system. It is a culture that is produced and reproduced.\n\nAnd now we know better how to initiate the process of ridding our world of racism. We know better than ever before. And I just have a few more words. I just - I want to say it involves standing up against heteropatriarchy. We know that it involves saying no to economic exploitation We know we cannot exclude any community that suffers from the effects of racism. And this includes Asian Americans. And this includes Arab Americans. This includes Palestinians. We know.\n\nWe know, finally, that we cannot struggle for human freedom without recognizing that we are all animals and that we must stand in support of our nonhuman coinhabitants of this planet. And thank you so much for the beautiful metaphor of the rabbit, the pattern of the rabbit escaping. But I think that we look at - we look at simple creatures like ants that are able to entirely transform a place and build these edifices, these architectural edifices, without at all harming the environment. I think we have much to learn from them, that it is possible to benefit from this Earth, even to transform it, without annihilating the very conditions of future life on this planet. Thank you very much.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Professor Angela Davis, speaking at the Malcolm X and Dr. Betty Shabazz Memorial and Educational Center, the site of the Audubon Ballroom in New York City, where Malcolm X was assassinated February 21st, 1965.

Holder's visit is part of the White House strategy to strengthen relationships between police and the communities they serve.\n\nWe go now to Washington, D.C., where we're joined by Michael Eric Dyson, University Professor of Sociology at Georgetown University. His piece for The New York Times this weekend was titled \"Where Do We Go After Ferguson?\" He's author of a forthcoming book on President Obama and race.\n\nProfessor Michael Eric Dyson, welcome back to Democracy Now!\n\nMICHAEL ERIC DYSON : Always great to be here.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What was your response to the verdict? I call it a verdict; it's actually a grand jury decision last week, but it seemed like a verdict. It seems that you had a grand jury that actually conducted a trial for one side of the case-the other side, Mike Brown, dead.\n\nMICHAEL ERIC DYSON : Absolutely. And we decry when cases of flagrant violation occur in other countries. We are upset when we think due process is not acknowledged. We are outraged when we think that people don't have access to evidence and are able to defend themselves, or at least people who are concerned about the case defend a particular point of view.\n\nWe had a full-on trial, except we didn't have anybody defending Mike Brown or his memory or his point of view. We had no testimony that was put forth by a defense lawyer that might have repudiated several of the things that Officer Wilson said. And then we had a prosecutor who was acting as a defense attorney for Officer Wilson. And there's a sad, tragic predictability about what happened, because Robert McCulloch, the prosecutor, has never brought a case against a police person who has been accused of killing a black person there in the area. So, when you put all that stuff together, it was a toxic brew. It was predictably something that would end in an unsatisfying verdict, because it was a trial. And I think this underscores the inability of people of color to get our viewpoints across.\n\nIt is not simply a matter of mistrust or distrust. You know, when somebody is abusing a child, you don't say, \"Let's develop trust between a parent and a child.\" You remove the abusive parent, give them some parenting skills and lessons, or, at the very least, prevent them from imposing further abuse on that child. So I think that the very metaphor that regulates and governs the kinds of meetings between the White House, which are critical and necessary, and police departments and citizens, surely, must involve developing trust, but trust only after the abuse has been removed.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You mention the word \"child,\" Michael, and that's exactly how Darren Wilson described how he felt: He felt like a five-year-old child dealing with-I think he put it-Hulk Hogan. Can you talk about the trove of papers that McChulloch released and that description that Darren Wilson gave of dealing with Mike Brown?\n\nMICHAEL ERIC DYSON : Yes, that's an excellent point to underscore. Mike Brown was six-four-six and 292 pounds. Officer Wilson is six-four-six, 210 pounds. So, you are hardly a child against a Hulk Hogan. Look at what's being reinforced here: the brawny, blustering, as Ann Petry put it, behemoth, this big black man, 18 years old, this big black man, who was rising up in the collective imagination of America, and in Officer Wilson's sight, as some kind of demonic force. He literally used the word \"demon.\" \"It was a demon-it looked like a demon coming at me.\" He has reduced him to a thing. He has made him an animal or less. He has made him a figment of not only his imagination, but the collective imagination of America that has been fearful of the black male threat. When you put all that stuff together, from pop culture, from deep religious and scientific treatises in the early part of the 20th century that were completely and thoroughly racist, then you've got a tremendously difficult problem on your hand.\n\nAnd that is to say, how do black people protect themselves not against simply the bullets of a police officer, but the metaphors, the stereotypes, the tropes that operate in that police officer's imagination that are equally lethal because they lead to trigger-happy cops, or at least, you know, hair-trigger decisions, where cops end up believing that they must use lethal force to contain a threat that's not even real, or, if there is a real threat, resort to the most lethal form of resolution of the conflict as opposed to trying other things, like driving away, like using mace, like tasing, like calling for help and the like? So, when we think about all of this, this is the dehumanization of African-American people. This is the failure to recognize our fundamental rights to exist in the state. And this is using state authority to legally execute black people on the streets of America.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Professor Dyson, I wanted to go to that exclusive interview with ABC News's George Stephanopoulos last week that Officer Darren Wilson gave, breaking his silence about the shooting of Mike Brown.\n\nGEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS : Is there anything you could have done differently that would have prevented that killing from taking place?\n\nDARREN WILSON : No.\n\nGEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS : Nothing?\n\nDARREN WILSON : No.\n\nGEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS : And you're absolutely convinced, when you look through your heart and your mind, that if Michael Brown were white, this would have gone down in exactly the same way?\n\nDARREN WILSON : Yes.\n\nGEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS : No question?\n\nDARREN WILSON : No question.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Stephanopoulos also asked Darren Wilson whether the killing of Michael Brown would always haunt him.\n\nDARREN WILSON : I don't think it's a haunting. It's always going to be something that happened.\n\nGEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS : You are-you have a very clean conscience.\n\nDARREN WILSON : The reason I have a clean conscience is because I know I did my job right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Professor Michael Eric Dyson, your response?\n\nMICHAEL ERIC DYSON : Well, this is disturbing. First of all, even people, men of war, women of war, who feel that they are executing their duly sworn responsibilities, have a sense of shame or guilt or at least some kind of disturbing emotion that makes them regretful of having to do what they think they have to do. This man has a clear conscience because he is conscience-less when it comes to executing his responsibilities in the face of, you know, black humanity, denying black humanity, refusing to acknowledge that there were alternatives available to him, and then feeling a kind of dispassion, a kind of clinical distance from the event, as if it was somebody else doing it. And the reason he is not bothered by it, because I think that this man has been reared in a culture that has taught him the lack of respect for black lives. That's why the \"black lives matter\" is important.\n\nAnd let's not forget, 30 for 30 , the ESPN documentary series, did one of their documentaries on-I think it was a football team from Ferguson, and one of the young men who was on that team was driving in a car. His parents were driving behind him. On the way home, the young man was pulled over by a cop. Since the father was in the car behind him, he gets out of the car. He goes to the car to discover what's going on. And they say this policeman treated them with profound disrespect, was extremely aggressive, hostile and nasty, was attempting, I think, to arrest the father, but ultimately did not do so, who wasn't officer Darren Wilson.\n\nSo, we know that this man is used to being six-foot-four, big, bigger than most of his, quote, \"competition,\" most of the people that he deals with. And when he met his match, so to speak, physically, to speak physically-let's be real. What may have happened there is the same thing that might have happened with Trayvon Martin and George Zimmerman, is that a white person-in this case, even worse, because he is a duly sworn officer of the state-attempting to menace and intimidate an African-American youth and may have got more than he bargained for or bitten off more than he could chew, and, as a result of that, withdraws his gun from its holster or wherever it was planted and then shot this boy mercilessly. And then, even on the streets, despite what he testified to, there are so many other witnesses that suggested Mike Brown's hands were up. He is asking his friend, you know, who heard him-he's asking the policeman, \"Why are you shooting me, and I don't have a weapon?\"\n\nSo, the reality is that when we piece together the evidence, Darren Wilson has an extremely dangerous mindset. His resignation came too late to save Mike Brown's life, but other policemen should be checked for similar kinds of aggression that become racialized when their targets are African-American people.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What needs to happen now, Professor Dyson, and what do you think of what President Obama is doing today at the White House, having this kind of summit with young civil rights leaders, talking about the issue of the militarizing of the police, as well as how communities of color can get along with law enforcement?\n\nMICHAEL ERIC DYSON : Well, that's all very necessary. I applaud the president for that. But again, when I made the analogy earlier about abuse in the communities that have been abused, let's not pretend that this is an equivalence. You know, there are no instances-well, there are not instances that we have been outraged about by attempts of broad communities to target police people and to constantly murder them, assault them and the like. There are tremendous tensions that need to be discussed.\n\nOf course the policing of communities is necessary, given the extraordinary, you know, difficulties in some communities and the crime in other communities. There's no doubting that. But to simply say, \"Let's develop trust,\" the trust rests upon what? Resolution of conflict, of negotiating differences and informing the police that they cannot be occupying forces in these African-American and Latino communities and in these poor areas.\n\nSo, you know, it's a matter of not only developing trust because we have to understand each other, we also have to tamp down on the lethal ferocity of police departments that have been overmilitarized, undertrained when it comes to dealing with people of color, refusing to acknowledge their humanity. And that thin blue line, that ostensibly separates police people from so-called civilian society, has often been blurred, and the erratic and, I think, often dangerous practices of rogue cops, or cops who don't have enough sensitivity about the humanity of people of color and others, needs to be raised.\n\nSo, it's a good first step, but I think, just like the Kerner Commission was convened by President Lyndon Johnson while the flames of Detroit, my home city, were yet burning, while there are embers of simmering tension in Ferguson yet, I think the president should empanel a commission to talk about police brutality in America and to understand its vicious consequences and what we can do to resolve it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You really got into it with former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani on Meet the Press last week when he talked about the problem of police violence, he said, was a distraction from the real problem of black-on-black crime. It starts with Giuliani.\n\nRUDY GIULIANI : I find it very disappointing that you're not discussing the fact that 93 percent of blacks in America are killed by other blacks. We're talking about the exception here.\n\nMICHAEL ERIC DYSON : Well, look, first of all-\n\nCHUCK TODD : Go ahead, Michael.\n\nRUDY GIULIANI : The significant-let me just finish-\n\nCHUCK TODD : This is about a trust issue.\n\nRUDY GIULIANI : We are talking-we are talking about the significant exception: 93 percent of blacks are killed by other blacks.\n\nMICHAEL ERIC DYSON : Let me tell you-let me respond to that.\n\nRUDY GIULIANI : I would like to see-\n\nCHUCK TODD : OK, I'm going to let him finish his sentence, then I'll let you respond.\n\nRUDY GIULIANI : I would like to see the attention-I'd like to see the attention paid to that, that you are paying to this, and the solutions to that.\n\nMICHAEL ERIC DYSON : He's taking up the time. Can I say this? First of all, most black people who commit crimes against other black people go to jail. Number two, they are not sworn by the police department as an agent of the state to uphold the law. So, in both cases, that's a false equivalency that the mayor has drawn.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Giuliani appeared later on Fox News and defended his argument. This is a part of what he said.\n\nRUDY GIULIANI : The danger to a black child in America is not a white police officer. That's going happen less than 1 percent of the time. The danger to a black child-if it was my child, the danger is another black. Ninety-three percent of the times, they're going to be killed by another black. And the idea that whites do not go to jail for killing blacks? First of all, only about 3 percent of whites kill blacks. They go to jail in approximately the same percentage as blacks go to jail. The conviction rate is almost exactly the same. The difference is, it's a very rare exception when a white kills a black.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That's former Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Your response, Michael Eric Dyson?\n\nMICHAEL ERIC DYSON : Well, first of all, as Disraeli said, they're \"lies, damned lies, and statistics,\" and we end up having statistical myopia. What I didn't get a chance to say, because I've got a host there, understandably, who's concerned about keeping the peace on the panel, so I'm being waved down by the host and hollered at, so to speak, by my opponent, and you don't get a chance, under those conditions, unlike right here, to say what you have to say.\n\nOne of the things that is necessary to say is that 84 percent of white people who are killed are murdered by other white people. Why aren't we outraged by white-on-white crime? Why aren't we talking about the vicious and insidious decline of moral stature in white America? Why aren't we talking about pathologies of white culture that lead to meth labs being generated on campuses or the decline in moral imagination as exhibited in pop stars who are decried from pulpits across America in white culture? So, we could develop a kind of, you know, tablet of demonology against white America, which would be ridiculous, because the problem is deeper and more profound than that. Intraracial violence in groups is endemic in America. So, people kill where they live. They commit crime where they live. If you want integrated killing, you have to have integrated communities-now, tongue in cheek there. The irony is the fact that Mr. Giuliani is unconscious of that, will not speak directly to that, because it would throw him off the scent of the trail of demonizing African-American people.\n\nNow, black people, themselves, are quite concerned about death in their own communities-in our own communities. Just yesterday here in D.C., a woman was on television, a black woman, asking for help in solving the murder of her son. And they had a videotape of or a recording of a man going into a building and then rushing out who is thought to be the murderer of her son. And I think it's an African-American man. And there's no, like, \"Oh, no, let's exempt him from moral critique because he's a black person.\" We are as outraged as anybody else by so-called black-on-black crime. We are enraged when black people kill black people. But let's not divorce the killing of black people by black people from broader cultural imaginations that have demonized black people. Black people watch a lot of television and consume a lot of pop culture. And the suspicion and skepticism of black identity pervades black culture, as well. So, in one sense-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Michael Eric Dyson, we just have-\n\nMICHAEL ERIC DYSON : Mm-hmm, yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We have less than a minute on the satellite, and you raised in your column the issue of Bill Cosby. And I was wondering if you could just end on your concern about what has come out about him, the raping and mugging of a series of women over 40 years?\n\nMICHAEL ERIC DYSON : It's evil. It's horrible. It should be talked about. It should be dealt with. I was demonized when I dealt with it 10 years ago in my book. Many black people waved me down and sent me away, saying that \"You're wrong by attacking a great figure like this.\" But what's hurtful to me is that while he's been accused of this raping and mugging, which is absolutely untoward-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And then drugging.\n\nMICHAEL ERIC DYSON : -and evil, at the same time, African-American women were demonized by him in his own language before, and they were not protected. So, both/and, not either/or.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, Michael Eric Dyson, I thank you very much for being with us, University Professor of Sociology at Georgetown University. We'll link to your piece in The New York Times , \"Where Do We Go After Ferguson?\" When we come back, we go to Cairo, Egypt, to talk about the dropping of charges against former President Mubarak.

We speak with Khalil Gibran Muhammad, a professor of history, race and public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School and the Suzanne Young Murray professor at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, about the significance of this moment and the history of policing in the U.S. \"We haven't seen a moment like this in at least half a century,\" Muhammad says. \"It's hard to know for sure where we're going to go from this moment, but it's clear that when we look at the history of policing, we have run out of options in terms of reform, in terms of thinking about what the police can do for themselves.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The Quarantine Report . I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González. It's been more than two weeks since the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis sparked a global uprising in defense of Black lives. The protests, seen in major cities, small towns across the U.S., show no sign of abating.\n\nAs calls to defund the police grow, protesters are beginning to see results. Last weekend, the majority of Minneapolis City Council pledged to abolish the police department in Minneapolis. In New York, state lawmakers have voted to ban the use of chokeholds and repeal a law that shields the disciplinary records of police officers from the public. In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti pledged to cut police funding by $150 million. Residents are now demanding he go much further.\n\nWell, for more on the significance of this moment and the history of policing in America, from slave patrols to the present day, we're joined by Khalil Gibran Muhammad, professor of history, race and public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School and the former director of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. He's the author of The Condemnation of Blackness: Race, Crime, and the Making of Modern Urban America .\n\nProfessor Muhammad, it's great to have you with us. If you could talk about this moment in time, both the uprisings, not only in this country, but around the world, and also the history of policing, that you so profoundly document?\n\nKHALIL GIBRAN MUHAMMAD : Thanks, Amy. Thanks, Amy and Juan, for having me on the show.\n\nListen, we haven't seen a moment like this in at least half a century, both here in the United States with protesters taking to the streets to demand, once and for all, not just police reform and accountability, but the prospect of a new vision of a relationship between state authorities and the health of a community. And the health of a community depends on everything, from the public goods and social services that people need, but also safety. And safety can come in many forms.\n\nSo, as far as what we're seeing, we're seeing a moment that is akin to the challenge that rocked the world in 1968 with global movements for various forms of anti-capitalist and anti-imperial and anticolonial organizing that took place both in the Global South and in many of the metropoles of the Global North.\n\nAnd, you know, it's hard to know for sure where we're going to go from this moment, but it's clear that when we look at the history of policing, we have run out of options in terms of reform, in terms of thinking about what the police can do for themselves. I liken this to asking the police agencies of this country to reform themselves is as ridiculous as asking the fossil fuel industry to solve our climate change crisis.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Professor, in your book, you talk about the 400 years of legacy of the development of these methods of policing, going back to the slave patrols in the mid-19th century. I'm wondering if you could take our listeners and viewers through some of that history?\n\nKHALIL GIBRAN MUHAMMAD : Absolutely. So, of course, people intuit and commonsensically understand that as a system of violent control over human beings, slavery required the use of violence to control people. And so, for the entire period going back to the mid-1600s into the early 1700s, colony after colony, from New York and Massachusetts to South Carolina and Virginia, passed a series of Black Codes or Negro Acts, various laws that were designed to empower everyday white citizens with the responsibility and, let me be clear, the duty to serve in an official capacity to surveil, monitor, to track and, when caught, to dispense corporal punishment against enslaved African people in the colonies. It was the largest bureaucracy\t dedicated to a form of policing that we recognize today. And it was everywhere in the colonies.\n\nBy the time the nation was born, in 1790, while there were gradual abolition laws that took root in many Northern colonies, the antebellum experience of free Blacks was little different. What went from a slave patrol became the responsibility of a growing cohort of modern police officers. And this problem, from slavery to freedom, simply changed uniform and changed the instruments and tools of keeping track of people of African descent, and it expanded in the United States of America.\n\nBut there's another part of this history that I think is really important, and that is that policing, in the broadest sense, was always about policing the essential workers of this society. And this is true in societies in countries all over the globe. And what do I mean by \"essential workers\"? Meaning the people who, at the bottom of the society, their freedom has always been constrained by more privileged and more elite, and in this country, whites.\n\nNow, whites, of course, range in class. And so, one of the ironies is that both poor whites in many parts of the country were policed, especially when they challenged political authority, when they challenged economic inequality, but at the same time, they were able to join police forces. By the 1840s and 1850s, we see the Irish Americans beginning to both make their way in America, but also begin to join the police force. They direct their sense of belonging in the United States for policing. [inaudible] both a reflection of a racial and class hierarchy and also a way of giving power to groups that feel like they don't have access to the top of the American economy.\n\nSo, policing is a reflection of a tremendous disorder in our economic system. It is a reflection of racial hierarchies that are deeply entrenched in our society. And when we see FOP or union leaders represented by working-class white men, partly, they have been empowered to define the profession as their own, not as a reflection of liberal democratic norms and universal ideas, but it is their profession. So, for me, to talk about the history of policing is also to talk about the history of white supremacy and racial capitalism in the United States of America.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: [inaudible] that I'm wondering, because this does not only affect - although it has largely affected the African American community, but it's also been - this method of using law enforcement and policing as a method of domination has also been used with other people of color, specifically Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, Native Americans. In 1862, President Lincoln ordered the hanging of 38 Dakota warriors who had gone to war against the U.S. in the midst of the Civil War. And they were hanged as criminals and as murderers, not as enemy combatants. And I'm thinking of the Texas Rangers, who were largely created to control and dominate Mexicans, who were called \"bandits,\" because they were defending their land. And even with Puerto Ricans, from Albizu Campos to Oscar López Rivera, all the freedom fighters were always branded as criminals and dealt with as criminals within the justice system. I'm wondering, this whole issue of the territorial expansion of the country necessitating even more police repression on these populations of color, your sense of it in your historical studies.\n\nKHALIL GIBRAN MUHAMMAD : Listen, Juan, I mean, the summaries and examples you just gave are incredibly important, because, to take it back to the very beginning, my colleague, Kelly Lytle Hernández, who has written about the U.S. Border Patrol and its origins in policing the movement of Mexicans coming to the country because the country wanted them here to work - but she also describes that the infrastructure of American colonial settlement, the very basis upon which the country literally expanded, as you say, the territorial expansion, was the jail. And she goes back to the very beginning, in the 1700s, to what is now the city of Los Angeles, which used to be the Tongva Basin, which used to be populated by Indigenous populations. And she said it was precisely the introduction of the physical jail as the instrument of control and domination, but a domination that was always rooted in harnessing the labor power of people, not to exterminate or to exclude them altogether, but to ensure that their labor would be extracted for the purposes of work, and then everything else would be controlled, that their freedom would be constrained.\n\nAnd that story is the story of every group in every part of the country whose labor power was the most important contribution that they would make. Their civil liberties, their civil rights, their human rights, their humanity itself, was optional, was secondary. Their right to political dissent was secondary. So, you can look at Chinese immigrants in San Francisco in the 1880s and see the same story. You can look in Chicago in the midst of the labor upheavals of the 1890s, with foreign-born immigrant whites demanding fair treatment in the workplace, and see the same story. You can look at Texas and look and see the story of the Texas Rangers, which enforced literal white property theft of Tejano and Mexican descendant landowners, people who not only had once been part of Mexico before the Mexican Revolution and before the annexation of Mexico by the United States in 1848, but people who were law-abiding, respectable citizens in their communities. And white settlers showed up and essentially accused them of false crimes, criminalized them, and Texas Rangers enforced that. So, across time, across space and across groups, policing has a tortured history of being enforcers of various forms of domination.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You know, this is so interesting. This is so interesting, Khalil, because you, before you were a Harvard professor, you were the head of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, which was established by Arturo Alfonso Schomburg, who was an African American Puerto Rican, bringing together all of these different cultures. I'm wondering if you now can go back, as you have, talking about the history of police repression, and talk about the history of the resistance to it?\n\nKHALIL GIBRAN MUHAMMAD : Yeah. So, the resistance is fascinating, because for every slave patrol was an individual or group of individuals who sought to subvert the system. And, of course, the most famous of those who fought against it was Harriet Tubman. And while often we think of her as a kind of caricature person who stands outside of history, she embodied the earliest forms of resistance to the system itself, but also to challenging the very violent instruments of that system.\n\nWe can look at the resistance of laborers, who armed themselves to fight against private security and police officers at the gates of companies in various cities of Massachusetts in the 1870s, in steel country in the Midwest, and the rise-up of populist, anti-capitalist organizing of socialist leaders in the turn of the 20th century. White workers and Black workers, in some cases, side by side, fought together to change the very understanding of their rights as economic beings and as citizens of this country. And most certainly, we can look at Northern cities as places where African Americans showed up, beginning in World War I, and completely transforming the understanding of work and citizenship in this nation by virtue of the Great Migration. And in time after time, instance after instance, African Americans demanded equality at the workplace, demanded equality in the homes, and they fought against white police and white citizens in that effort.\n\nWe saw commissions beginning in, really, the 1890s around white police agencies focused on immigrants, and then we saw the same thing occur in the Great Migration period, beginning in Chicago, as the result of an anti-Black riot in 1919. These commissions came to the same conclusion over and over again. For over a century, from Chicago to the consent decree in Chicago in 2017 around the Laquan McDonald shooting, you have the arc of a hundred years of history saying the same story, which is that some precipitating act of violence by a police officer is only the tip of the iceberg of a submerged story of hundreds, in some cases thousands, of people being subject to various forms of everyday forms of abuse and trauma by the police. And that resistance, in the form of those commissions, is Black folks speaking to their condition.\n\nOf course, the Black freedom movement gave us the Black Panther Party and other radical groups that essentially centered police brutality as the key issue for securing Black dignity and citizenship in this country and other places, and they were subject to the full weight of the federal government in repressive tactics, including COINTELPRO and other mechanisms, including assassination, which, in the most high-profile case, killed Fred Hampton in 1969 in Chicago.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to turn to U.S. Attorney General William Barr speaking Sunday on CBS' Face the Nation . Asked if he believes there's systemic racism in law enforcement, this is his response. It's not playing. But let me ask you this. Professor Khalil Gibran Muhammad, you've talked about the resistance through history. How does what we're seeing now - it looks like we have William Barr.\n\nATTORNEY GENERAL WILLIAM BARR : I think there's racism in the United States still, but I don't think that the law enforcement system is systemically racist. I understand the distrust, however, of the African American community, given the history in this country. I think we have to recognize that for most of our history, our institutions were explicitly racist. ... Since the 1960s, I think we've been in a phase of reforming our institutions and making sure that they're in sync with our laws and aren't fighting a rearguard action to impose inequities.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : \"I don't think that the law enforcement system is [systemically] racist.\" Professor Muhammad, your response?\n\nKHALIL GIBRAN MUHAMMAD : Well, I mean, I was actually more impressed with some of the concessions he made in that speech than this fine line he draws between individual rotten apples and the system itself.\n\nI'd like your listeners and viewers to think about this this way. This would be the akin of saying that Americans' prisons are not built to dehumanize, given everything we know what goes on inside of them, despite the fact that people who show up to work every day are not necessarily evil people. That's the problem we're having around this conversation around policing. Policing, as a system, has been a system of control that sorts people and decides who gets to live and who gets to die with even the mere accusation of criminality. That is not true in white affluent communities. It is not true in communities where political elites are. We just saw a parade of criminality in the Trump administration, and all we kept hearing is federal prosecutors say, \"We're not sure we can win this case. We're not sure we can bring the case.\" We didn't see Michael Cohen be subjected to pepper spray or flash grenades or a knee on his neck.\n\nSo, there is a double standard of justice in America, that police are enforcing white supremacy, and they're enforcing economic hierarchy. And until we come to terms with that, in the way that we should be coming to terms with what happens inside of our prisons, we're going to continue to see the resistance take to the streets and demand justice and transformation.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Khalil, I wanted to ask you about a particular aspect of the role of the press and the media narrative in the issues of policing and police abuse. For most of the country's history - and I've done quite a bit of studying of the history of the press in America - the press functioned almost as an intelligence operation for the dominant white community. During the colonial period, as much as a third of all of the content of American newspapers was intelligence to the white settlers about what the African American or the Native American communities were doing. But even up to the '60s, the press were largely white, and even the rebellions of the '60s, they reporting from a white perspective, as the Kerner Commission noted. But in recent years, as the press themselves have become diversified, we're seeing both in the mainstream media, and of course now with citizen videos, this enormous change in the narrative as to what the role of the police is. I'm wondering if you think that that, along with the public resistance movement, will have a more lasting effect in terms of redirecting or changing the nature of policing in America.\n\nKHALIL GIBRAN MUHAMMAD : Juan, it's a great question, and I certainly appreciate even your sharing your own research and brief history of media in the past. I think it's important.\n\nSo, if the question is \"Can we see this moment for the democratization of media itself?\" obviously, by virtue of social media and the fact that citizens can aggregate and spread news in ways that they could not before, I do think this is a fundamentally different moment. The gatekeeping of information and distribution of knowledge has broken down in many ways, both for good and for bad. But on the good side of the ledger, there's no question that this is a moment of possibility, because there is a crisis of legitimacy in our democratic institutions, most obviously in the executive branch with the White House.\n\nBut it is also true that news agencies around the country, no matter who's in charge - a Black person or white prison or a Latino or Asian American - have been deferential, over the past, to official accounts. And the crisis of legitimacy for police agencies has led many of those news directors, no matter who they are, to begin to think, like, we can't trust the official record. In the case of Derek Chauvin's killing of George Floyd, he lied on the police record. So, the deference that has been assumed up to this time now is breaking down.\n\nThe ability to shoot in real time the killing and execution of people by police, or the brutality directed by police, as is the case in Buffalo and many other places as police use brutality to stop protesters from protesting against brutality, means that this crisis of legitimacy will be resolved. The only question of what the resolution looks like is: How long will people stay in the streets demanding change?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Khalil Gibran Muhammad, finally, defund the police. Do you see a comparable movement in history? And how this has changed the narrative?\n\nKHALIL GIBRAN MUHAMMAD : The defund-the-police moment is an incredible adjustment to the issue of abolition, that has mostly been about activists seeding the notion that these institutions are fundamentally broken. Organizations like Critical Resistance, that Ruth Gilmore and Angela Davis began many decades ago, have helped to develop the theory of change, of which abolition in our prison system and in our police have been developed.\n\nDefund takes the core idea of abolition and says, \"If we were to start over, what would we decide police should be doing versus not be doing?\" Now, I'm already picking a middle position between the notion that we simply wipe out police altogether, which is one abolitionist version of it. But defund, as it is being articulated in places like Minneapolis, is really a conversation of: We're going to start over, and we're going to start over by putting together a list, from everything from nuisance calls to wellness checks to claims of violent crime, and we're going to decide what the police ought to be doing. And once we see what's left over, then that's the percentage of the budget that the police, a new version of the police, will keep. The rest will go to other public services.\n\nWe can use violence interrupters, who are public health workers trained in the community, by the community, for the community, to in fact deal with conflict resolution. This is how it works in nearly every other country where police have not been militarized and given unlimited resources and power to police their own citizens as if they were soldiers in occupied territory. People resolve conflicts inside of healthy, functioning communities. So people in this country need the same training and resources to be able to do similar things. That's what defund is about.\n\nI'll say one more thing about this. And that is that police unions are a problem. So, those on the left cannot be ambivalent about the need for opening up collective bargaining agreements where police unions are concerned, because they are a major impediment to the reforms and the defund or whatever version of new policing is going to emerge out of this moment.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Khalil Gibran Muhammad, I want to thank you so much for being with us, professor of history, race and public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, Suzanne Young Murray professor at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, author of The Condemnation of Blackness: Race, Crime, and the Making of Modern Urban America .\n\nWhen we come back, we look at the story of Martin Gugino, the 75-year-old Buffalo peace activist who's continuing remaining hospitalized after being pushed to the ground by two Buffalo police officers. Now President Trump has attacked him on Twitter.

      "text": "'They use our culture': the Black creatives and fans holding K-pop accountable\n\nAs K-pop grows, international fans and those writing and producing songs want the industry to to develop a more sensitive understanding of race\n\nO n Tuesday 2 June, Grammy award-winning songwriter and music artist Tiffany Red returned home from a trip to her local mall, where she had encountered the national guard armed with large rifles, an experience that left Red \"traumatized\".\n\nExactly one week before, George Floyd had been killed in Minneapolis, and tensions in the country were rising as hundreds of thousands took to the streets in protest. Tuesday 2 June was also #BlackoutTuesday, a global \"social media moment\" that grew out of the music industry's #TheShowMustBePaused , an initiative created to \"hold the industry at large\" - including major corporations and their partners who benefit from the efforts, struggles and successes of Black people - accountable.\n\nStill processing her experience at the mall earlier that day, Red opened her inbox to find a message from her South Korean music publisher, Ekko Music Rights, regarding a $66 payment for a song she had written for one of K-pop's most popular groups, NCT Dream - a straightforward business transaction with zero acknowledgment of what Red, a Black American woman, may have been going through given the news cycle then.\n\nFor Red, who has worked with artists such as Zendaya, Jennifer Hudson and Jason Derulo, this was a final straw. She had already decided to stop writing K-pop music because she felt she was poorly compensated, but Ekko's aloofness spoke to a continued concern she harbored about the industry at large: that despite K-pop's reliance on Black music and culture, the industry didn't actually support Black lives.\n\nToday, a striking number of K-pop hits are written and produced by Black Americans and a significant percentage of K-pop fans in the US are Black. As K-pop grows in popularity worldwide , many international fans are waiting for the industry to develop a more sensitive, globalized understanding of race.\n\nWithin K-pop, blackface, mouthing or saying racial slurs, and purely aesthetic uses of Black culture and hairstyles are still common. In recent weeks, as the media has painted K-pop fans as politically active and engaged for overwhelming racist hashtags with videos of their favorite acts and reserving thousands of tickets to artificially boost expected attendance at Donald Trump's Tulsa rally, official statements of support for Black lives have trickled in from a handful of groups and idols.\n\nArguably the most well-known K-pop group in the world, BTS, and their parent company, Big Hit Entertainment (whose CEO has stated publicly that \"Black music is the base\" of the septet's musical identity), were some of the most vocal, and the only group to donate money - $1m - to Black Lives Matter. But many contend that the industry overall has failed to show unified support for the movement. Now, Black creatives and fans are holding them accountable.\n\nSM Entertainment is one of South Korea's three largest entertainment companies. It is credited with producing the first K-pop idol group, H.O.T., in 1996, which established the \"SM performance\" style that the brand still employs today: a combination of impressive visuals, dance, rock, rap and hip-hop that took inspiration from Black American artists of the MTV generation. Songwriter and producer Micah Powell attended six SM songwriting camps between 2015 and 2018. At one camp, he wrote a song called Devil and created a dance move to go with it, which he then showed to SM executives. \"The entire staff lit up,\" Powell says of their reaction.\n\nDevil became the lead single of SM group Super Junior's 2015 album of the same name. When Powell watched the music video for Devil for the first time, he was shocked to see that his dance move, a hip tap and high clap combination, had been used as part of the song's chorus , without his permission, and without credit or compensation. Powell's background vocals on the track had also been used without payment or credit.\n\n\"I had to hunt [SM] down,\" he says, and was eventually paid $200 for the vocals which he had recorded in Korean, a language he does not speak. Powell says the industry's lack of action is \"a microcosm of a bigger issue, part of a bigger puzzle of inequality\". K-pop looks to the west for inspiration and \"this is exactly how white people see us. They use our culture, they love our culture, they'll take everything from our culture, but don't pour back into our culture.\"\n\nMore than two weeks after Red posted her frustrations with the industry on Instagram , SM Entertainment, the \"sister company\" of Ekko Music Rights, released a statement that read: \"We stand with our Black collaborators, friends and fans\" and added that \"we are new to this conversation\". Red's frustration is palpable as she scoffs at this: \"You aren't new to this conversation, you are a part of this conversation. We are the people who make your music. Why would you ever think that you're excluded from this?\"\n\n\"I am Black before I am a K-pop stan,\" says Ellie, 19, who prefers to use her first name to avoid the harassment some K-pop fans face when they speak out against popular groups, \"and when I was first discovering NCT 127, the Limitless video really offended me.\"\n\nLimitless, a 2017 single from the SM group NCT 127, was produced and composed by a handful of successful Black American producers. In the song's music video , the company styled some members of the group in hairstyles typically worn by Black men and accessorized them in clothing that directly referenced Black hip-hop artists.\n\nEllie notes that while styling like this is what's been deemed \"unique and fresh\" within the industry, it's \"all been seen before within the Black community\". She is a huge supporter of NCT 127 and has slept on the street three times to see them in person during appearances in New York City. She also danced with the group when they made a surprise appearance last year in Washington Square Park.\n\nIn 2019, NCT 127 reportedly made over $24m touring in US arenas, many filled with Black fans (maybe as much as 18% according to a recent fan poll ). And yet the group and SM itself \"rarely ever show any remorse when they offend [those] fans by culturally appropriating, and continue to misstep\", says Ellie, most recently by styling an NCT 127 member in a Lynyrd Skynyrd T-shirt with the Confederate flag on it for a music video. Fans of NCT 127, or \"NCTzens\", have tried to call attention to these concerns through organized outreach to SM but \"despite being emailed, tweeted at and called out [the company] continues to harm Black fans\" with their choices, Ellie says.\n\nK-pop fan Davonna Gilpin, 27, who lives in Los Angeles, has been following Korean music for 12 years and hosts a pop culture podcast called Melanetizens with a fellow Black K-pop fan. She says that this is an industry-wide problem. \"I've noticed during my time [as a fan that] the concerns of others are almost always acknowledged, but not the concerns of Black people.\" For example, YG Entertainment recently edited out a depiction of the Hindu god Ganesha from a Blackpink music video because it had been deemed offensive by many Hindu fans. Just last month, SM publicly apologized for styling that included a pin with a Japanese slur. Within days of receiving complaints, the company not only delayed the release of a music video but also issued a reprint of the entire album so that the pins could be digitally removed. And yet, Gilpin notes, the Confederate flag remains visible to the public. Given that, \"I can't help but think they've seen all the concerns and critiques and choose to ignore it,\" she concludes.\n\nAfter seeing Red's Instagram posts, Ellie, Gilpin, and fellow fan De'Andra Johnson, 23, who lives in Inglewood, California, organized #SMBlackout , a hashtag event \"to bring awareness to the importance of Black fans and Black creatives in SM's roster\".\n\nGilpin says: \"I've skipped lunch to save up to go to multiple NCT 127 tour stops and buy albums and merch. So on top of how disrespectful it was [for SM] to not speak up for their Black employees and collaborators, I felt it was also disrespectful to their Black consumers. If Black lives don't matter to them then Black dollars, Black music and Black fashion and style shouldn't either.\"\n\nOne week after the #SMBlackout event, SM released its official statement . Ellie says those six sentences, which were only posted in English and did not lay out a plan of action, \"did not hold any weight\". Gilpin adds: \"I was confused by the 'we're new to this conversation' part because we've been trying to have this conversation with them for years and they decided they didn't want to listen.\" She says that if they are truly interested in creating change, \"now is the best time for them to come forward and actively participate, especially since the industry has been moving into a huge global spotlight. To me, it's not a political or controversial stance. It should be a no-brainer for anyone, any company, any industry to stand for human rights and equality.\"\n\nJohnson notes that she is still waiting for statements from YG and Pledis, which produce a handful of chart-topping groups she also likes. Other K-pop fans are waiting on action from the companies that manage their favorite acts, including JYP, whose CEO has incorporated blackface into his performances as a solo artist and also named practice rooms at the company facilities after Black artists he admires.\n\nFor Red, this moment is the beginning of a new personal mission: to bring change to the music industry through activism. \"It's needed, it's missing. There's no one protecting the artists and there's so much to protect us from,\" she says. She will continue producing her solo music at home in Los Angeles, but doesn't have any intention of writing for others any longer.\n\n\"I'd love to see what would happen to K-pop if we all stopped [writing for the industry],\" Red says. \"I would be a liar if I didn't say that I didn't participate in helping them steal our culture. We didn't make the system, but it's all of our responsibility to fix it to make it better. Black people are not the only people who will benefit from that system changing in K-pop. Everyone will benefit from that. It'll create a whole new system of accountability.\""

      "text": "Some white artists, like Elvis, exploit Black culture. So celebrate Bobby Caldwell, who enriched it\n\nThe debate about cultural appropriation is fractious and gets muddled. But then I think about a man who makes it all clear\n\nA Black person growing up in the west will experience moments of shock. There is the first time you knowingly experience racism, and here, for me, was another: the first time I realised that the man who sang the soul classic What You Won't Do for Love was white .\n\nLong before there was Ed Sheeran, Adele, Justin Timberlake or, before them, Simply Red, Lisa Stansfield, Jon B (the only white musician Tupac Shakur ever made a record with), or even the current underground king of blue-eyed soul Mayer Hawthorne , there was Bobby Caldwell , who died last week.\n\nWe talk a lot about appropriation, about who inspires what, who owns it, who copies it, who leases it, who honours it, who exploits it. This is why Bobby Caldwell, RIP, has much to teach us.\n\nCultural appropriation as a concept is widely misunderstood and therefore easily ridiculed. People who throw accusations of appropriation around on an erroneous or false basis only serve to assist those who wish to dismiss the concept.\n\nAt its most serious, under the bonnet of cultural appropriation lies a struggle with five important socioeconomic themes: power, privilege, portrayal, perception and pound sterling (money). It is a situation in which the dominant sector of society leverages its position to loot a disadvantaged sector of society for those five Ps, helping the dominant further strengthen its already privileged position.\n\nGiven their history of having almost everything looted and their cultures debased or dismissively ridiculed, Black people in particular feel an understandable sting at cultural appropriation. Black culture cannot be separated from the Black struggle. And Black culture, especially from a western perspective, is the bedrock of modern popular culture. Yet it quickly becomes \"everyone's property\" (for everything else and everyone else there is the Patent Office).\n\nCompounding the sting, where white people often find celebration and wealth accumulation in Black culture, Black people far too frequently find stigma and tragedy. Even where their own cultural heritage is concerned, Black practitioners are often crowded out by white ones and Black people end up earning the equivalent of crumbs.\n\nBut Caldwell was a different matter altogether. He cut his teeth with Little Richard, and when he made his own demo tape it was roundly rejected by the major labels. Down on his luck, his mother suggested he approach Henry Stone's TK Records, a Miami-based independent powerhouse best known for cultivating the rise of disco with genre-defining hits such as Rock Your Baby by George McCrae (which topped charts in the UK, the US and across Europe), Ring My Bell by Anita Ward (another massive No 1 in Britain and the US), and an avalanche of hit records by KC and the Sunshine Band.\n\nHis self-titled debut album was a triumph of a soul record, but the problem was that he sounded like a member of the Temptations at Motown or the Stylistics (remember Betcha by Golly, Wow), but looked as if he belonged in the lily-white Osmond family . To ensure his album wasn't shunned by R&B radio, Caldwell's \"whiteness\" was concealed on the cover of his debut album .\n\nThe plan worked. What You Won't Do for Love hit No 6 on the Billboard R&B charts and No 10 on the Hot 100 in 1978. And then the real life-defining magic happened. Invited on tour by Natalie Cole, Caldwell's mask had to come off. In a 2015 interview with the Red Bull Music Academy he recalled the moment .\n\n\"It's the very first night in Cleveland, at an amphitheatre. We're talking about 7,000 brothers and sisters, and I was the only cracker there. And everyone is coming to hear 'soul brother' Bobby Caldwell. I walked out on stage and you could hear a pin drop, just a total hush came over the crowd. It was like, 'What the fuck is this!?' I stayed and delivered, after about 10 minutes, I had them in my pocket. That was the night I became a man, I'll tell ya.\"\n\nIn that moment, Caldwell could have culturally tanked, like Jamie Oliver's ill-advised jollof rice , or seemed as ludicrous as the English faux hip-hop group Blazin' Squad . He could have poppified his music and become enormous - like Vanilla Ice or Elvis Presley. Instead, Caldwell helped define the difference between being a cultural appropriator and a genuinely skilled and heartfelt cultural practitioner with a real understanding of and appreciation for the art, for the culture and its creators.\n\nHe didn't think he sounded Black (he thought he sounded \"like a white guy that was influenced by R&B music\", adding, \"but people would swear up and down I was Black. Huge amounts of money were lost in bets.\"). He also didn't sound like a confused cultural voyeur. He was not leveraging any privilege; he was a genuinely great soul man.\n\nAnd, critically, he gave back. He embraced hip hop as much as hip hop embraced him. He allowed his music to be prominently sampled by rappers - What You Won't Do for Love became Do for Love by Tupac, the music in My Flame became Sky's the Limit by The Notorious BIG, and Open Your Eyes became The Light by Common (produced by the late great J Dilla) - all of which immortalised his work for a younger generation.\n\nThe core owners of the culture, the core audience, couldn't have embraced and celebrated him more. Unlike many a white performer of Black music who came after him (and even before him) his core audience remained Black (he was also big in Japan).\n\nThe appropriation debate gets heated and muddled, people transgress, finger pointing is rife; but it's clear to me that it's possible to truly embrace and play a part in a culture that isn't obviously your own - and that we need more Caldwells. He was not just the type of white person who gets invited to the mythical Black barbecue, he was the type who is trusted with the stereo and the grill. He could have been the poster boy for cultural appropriation, and instead became an integrated poster boy for the culture.\n\nCultures are broad and those who protect and prize them can detect inauthenticity at a thousand paces. Look at Caldwell, people - look and learn.\n\nNels Abbey is a writer, broadcaster and former banker, and the author of Think Like A White Man.

      "text": "Why white parties are a fixture in Black culture\n\nThese events - where everyone wears white - are where Black beauty, swagger and sartorial creativity intersect\n\nN ot everyone can carry off a white suit with matching mink trim - in May, at that. But Will Phelps, a party promoter from Detroit, was not about to be caught twinning with a guest wearing the same outfit at one of his legendary white parties, which he's thrown since his 34th birthday in 1998.\n\nHe commissioned the custom ensemble for his 2010 fete, requesting snowy fur on the pockets, zipper and the knot of his wide tie. Because Phelps's philosophy is go big or go home, he tried to one-up himself from each party to the next. One year, he ordered a pair of white alligator boots. Another time, he mandated that only white cars be admitted to the VIP parking lining the street outside the club where the party was held. In 2018, five couples got married at the white party. And there was the year he advertised the event using muscular men decked out in tiny white swim trunks. Their pecs and abs bore invitations to attend the soiree, written in white body paint.\n\nBlending elegance and excess may be the hallmark of the white party itself. It's become a fixture in Black communities in the US, an intergenerational \"grown-and-sexy\" gathering where everyone wears white and Black beauty, swagger and sartorial creativity intersect. This past Labor Day, partiers marked the imminent end of summer with an \"Afrobeat Heavenly Bodies\" version in Austin, Texas; a Baltimore party where the old-school R&B singer Keith Sweat headlined; a day party in little Louisburg, North Carolina; and dozens - if not, hundreds - of others across the nation. There is a malleable grammar to the white party: it has a uniform - flowing linen is the party's textile of choice. And the party endures because it's an ebullient celebration and communal spectacle wrapped in a culturally relevant package. The white party salutes the perpetual power of Black people and Black culture to transform.\n\nA former hairdresser and nightclub owner, Phelps calls his annual soiree the \"Original White Party\". So do plenty of other promoters, for whom bragging rights are paramount. Yet the white party, as we know it, has no single influence or root. Consider its history a tale of multiple genesis. The Miami advocates Frank Wager and Jorge Suarez created a white party benefit for an HIV/Aids prevention non-profit in 1985. And in the same decade, the Dîner en Blanc series invited white-clad diners to commune and cater meals in a posh Parisian location.\n\nPhelps said he noticed color-themed parties among Black Detroiters in the late 1990s, and the cream editions captured his attention. But white parties got their most fabled come-up with the ones Diddy threw in St Tropez and later at his East Hampton estate (back when he was better known as Puffy). From the late 1990s to 2009, Diddy's bashes brought together It Girls, hip-hop moguls and entertainment icons: Mariah Carey, Beyoncé, Lil' Kim, Star Jones, Donna Karan, Leonardo DiCaprio, the Kardashians and Hiltons and LL Cool J all dropped in over the years. In August 2004, Aretha Franklin attended, adorned in a bedazzled duster and carrying a transparent tote. Jet magazine reported once on the flamethrowers and the luxurious surf-and-turf dinners washed down with Ciroc vodka. Another year, TMZ wrote: \"Anyone not wearing all white was turned away.\"\n\nBy Phelps's second annual party in Detroit, he was also rejecting people for not wearing white. \"The men had more trouble finding clothes,\" he said. \"But I had to not let them in just to make a point. Because if you let people not follow the thing, they'll never follow the thing. Once they saw the girls in there, they found a way to get that white.\" Phelps went to Detroit boutiques and department stores, requesting that they stock more white apparel. \"Come March or April, their windows turned white. People used to say 'It's snowing' when the white party came.\"\n\nT he aesthetic pleasure of Black skin under white fabric seems a given - every person I interviewed for this story said some iteration of \"it just looks good.\" Tameka Foster Raymond, an Atlanta-based fashion designer and author, said robing one's self in white boosts the mood. \"When you've got on what we call your 'crispy white', you just feel good. You don't want anybody to put their makeup on you. You don't want to spill a colored drink on yourself. It makes you walk a little taller.\" Foster Raymond has styled many musicians, including Lauryn Hill, Jay-Z and Foster Raymond's ex-husband, Usher (she masterminded his white suit-fedora combo and news-making entrance via yacht at the 2004 Video Music Awards in Miami).\n\nWhite parties bind Black people together in mutual glorification of Black beauty. And that's no small thing, even when it seems the parties' supreme goal is a good unthinking baccanal. Whiteness has long symbolized purity and cleanliness. The color black and Blackness as racial category have often been identified with filth, depravity and deprivation, even monstrosity. The concept of cleanliness - especially as it pertains to wearing white - can never be neutral for a people presumed prima facie to be dirty, whose ancestors include enslaved and free washerwomen who labored to ensure white people's garments stayed white. Yet to be \"clean\" in Black vernacular also means to be dressed immaculately and utterly convinced of one's flyness.\n\nPart of the white party's appeal is that it democratizes that flyness. Looking good in white is accessible to anyone across age and class. Foster Raymond plans to throw an all-white event for her son's upcoming 16th birthday party and noted that the white party \"is the easiest kind of party to dress for\", because a white T-shirt is always within reach.\n\nThe pageantry and the peacocking that takes place at white parties - whether you're wearing a gown or a tank top - likely has roots in the past, according to Jonathan Michael Square, a historian at Parsons School of Design. Square noted the historical significance of African diasporic people's knack for blending the sacred and the secular: \"In a lot of Afro-diasporic religions, even African American Christianity, white textiles are really important. Think about baptisms,\" he said. \"A lot of Black people wear white to funerals, which is kind of counter to a Western tradition of wearing black to funerals. You tend to wear white at ceremonies or during a certain period of initiation into these religions. There's a spiritual component, and even if people aren't entirely aware of it, they're still tapping into that history.\"\n\nThat history is ubiquitous in cultural products and visual archives of Black life: Gordon Parks's photographs of Nation of Islam women, a sea of white in their alabaster head coverings and dresses; new Divine Nine sorority sisters swathing themselves in \"uninterrupted white\" from head to toe; church ushers and acolytes in shimmering suits and frocks, the white-suited blaxploitation-esque models in Barkley Hendricks paintings. Wearing white sets a person apart, signaling individualistic sartorial flair or that you are part of some collective larger than yourself.\n\nT he cultural historian and curator Brittany Hutchinson attended her first white party when she was 25. She'd watched her mother, aunt and grandfather preparing for white parties as a child, and attending the event was a rite of passage for her, a sign that Hutchinson, now 38, was a sophisticated adult. In her native Chicago, there's a special homegrown variant: an all-white cruise around Lake Michigan, complete with local steppers dazzling with their footwork. \"Seeing my mom get ready for a white party was the introduction, but then my awareness grew through being around [older relatives],\" Hutchinson said. \"You just kinda absorb that information.\"\n\nShe also practices a diasporic faith, Lucumi , sometimes known as Santería . Its followers frequently wear white after initiations or in chaotic times; Hutchinson might wrap her head in cloth to dispel confusion. White is associated with the orisha, or deity, Obatala, whom Hutchinson said \"signifies wisdom, a coolness of temperament and a very measured, careful approach to decision making and mental clarity\". And while there may not be a traceable direct connection between the orisha and white parties, wearing white can mean you are protected or momentarily unsoiled by the grit of daily life. That message is not at odds with a satisfying white party romp, Hutchinson said. \"A white party's meant to be lighthearted and purely enjoyable. It's a moment where your issues, your troubles are supposed to not enter that space where the party's happening\" - if only for the one day when you're wearing that pristine white bodycon dress or guayabera and imagining a carefree world."

      "text": "Ravers, Rastas and rugby league stars: why the story of Black British culture is about more than just London\n\nBlack Britons altered the DNA of music, fashion and sport in this country. But why is it framed as a London story? Bradford-born writer Lanre Bakare explores how it reaches far beyond the capital - and farther back in time\n\nT he DVD slips into the loading tray, and I watch in hope rather than expectation. I've been told Tony Palmer's The Wigan Casino is the greatest ever depiction of a northern soul all-nighter, and I want to see it for myself. The film is a window into the underground scene that emerged in the 1970s, powered by soul records that had flopped years earlier. But I'm not interested in the music or the dancing - it's the crowd I've got an eye on.\n\nI spot what I'm after. A young man, glistening under the spotlight as he spins balletically in a yellow vest. Then another person catches my eye with his perfectly picked-out afro. It's a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment, so I rewind to check, and yes, it's true. A few minutes later, two girls clamber on to a coach, and one waves goodbye down the camera lens. Another boy squeezes through the crush at the front door. These young people are there for the same reason as everyone else: hard-to-find soul music that's perfectly crafted for dancing. But all of them stand out. They're different from the majority of the 1,200 dancers crammed into Wigan Casino. They're Black and British.\n\nSeeing those Black faces contradicted what I'd heard about the scene. Northern soul was about white working-class audiences falling in love with and coveting forgotten Black American music. My book We Were There started as a cultural expedition. I wanted to find something that wasn't supposed to exist: Black northern soul fans from the 1970s and 80s. When I tracked them down, I found their stories changed the way I thought not just about northern soul but about Britain at the start of the Thatcher era. I wanted to know why. I began to wonder what other stories I might have been mistold or had never explored at all - and what those stories could reveal to me, and others, about Britain then and now.\n\nNo European country has been changed by Black culture more than the UK. British music, fashion, sport, literature, TV and film have had their DNA altered by the influence of millions of people who have come to this small island from across the African diaspora. Our sounds, food, languages, intellect and sartorial choices have meshed with what was already here to create modern British culture. Some of our biggest Hollywood stars - Daniel Kaluuya, Cynthia Erivo, David Oyelowo, Letitia Wright, John Boyega - are Black; designers such as Nicholas Daley and Grace Wales Bonner transmit our styles globally; artists such as Sonia Boyce and John Akomfrah represent Britain on the biggest stages; much of England's men's football team is of Black heritage. Black British culture is an inseparable part of British culture.\n\nModern Black Britishness, which has spread and morphed into myriad forms, was forged in the late 1970s and the 80s, a time of huge ruptures and tumult - social, economic and political. Everywhere you looked, a battle was taking place, and every single gain had to be fought for: from Birmingham , where academics such as Stuart Hall and Rastafarians were taking on racism in the media, to Leeds and Sheffield, where pioneering music producers would express a new Black British confidence, and even to the countryside, where the Black Environment Network would battle for their own place in the UK's rural idyll.\n\nThis was a time of artistic and cultural creation unrivalled in the 20th century. A period when Black British culture flourished and contemporary British culture began to form. But our understanding of that influence is limited, and for many, it starts and ends in one place: London .\n\nI was born in the middle of the Thatcher era: 1984. My memories are fuzzy, softened by time; half-remembered fragments. Images of the poll tax riots, milk breaks at primary school, Ian Wright's gold tooth and Norman Lamont's eyebrows. But when I think of my home town of Bradford , there are details that come into focus. I can still run through the surnames like a Rolodex in my head: the Taylors, the Sarrs, the Davids, the Ibegbunas, the Ekongs, the Fehintolas, the Cookes, the Oakleys and the Braithwaites. The families you knew and the families you knew of - either by reputation or connection. I can still plot a chart that links the Black families in my area of Bradford: the faces, the cars, the haircuts, the living room furniture and the intellects.\n\nI left Bradford at the age of 18 and lived all over the UK - Liverpool , Newcastle, Sheffield, Bristol - in my early 20s before settling in London 14 years ago. In the capital, I've often been met by other Black people who express amazement at the fact Black life existed beyond the M25. Their responses weren't hostile - there was an anthropological desire to understand this otherness. My time away didn't make me reassess the Black culture I grew up with in Bradford, but it did make me question why it was so rarely acknowledged and little understood by everyone from the average person on the street to the institutions and centres of power in London.\n\nIf you want to understand the unrest that spread around the country in 1981, you'll most likely be pointed towards events in Brixton. While the south London neighbourhood was a centre of Black culture and resistance, it wasn't the only one - there were dozens around the UK, like in Liverpool, which had a different, older connection to the unrest. If you want to understand the far right and resistance to groups such as the National Front, you'll find documentary-makers, journalists and writers referring to the battle of Lewisham in 1977 as a moment, the moment, when communities came together to fight back against the provocative marches. The Rock Against Racism concert in London's Victoria Park one year later, where 100,000 people turned out to see the Clash, X-Ray Spex and Steel Pulse perform, is held up as the exemplar of when culture was used to counter rising fascism. If you want to understand the hostile relationship between the police and Black communities, you'll find accounts of the unrest at Notting Hill carnival in 1976 as the totemic battle when Black Britain fought back.\n\nAll those events were crucial, but all feed into a simplistic narrative about Black Britishness, which suggests that a group of people, most of whom arrived in the UK after the second world war, took to the streets to rebel - with anger and with violence. This consensus view allows little room for nuance, and obscures a bigger, more complex tapestry of life in Britain during the Thatcher years. There are people in my book whose families go back five or six generations in the UK - long before the Empire Windrush arrived; there are artists and authors, legal campaigners, feminists, ravers, rude boys and rugby league superstars.\n\nSome of the stories completely upend established cultural lore. Take the one about how house music came to the UK: the established narrative is that four intrepid Londoners - Danny Rampling, Johnny Walker, Nicky Holloway and Paul Oakenfold - went to Ibiza in 1987 and imported house music, providing the building blocks for the rave scene in the UK. But before acid house went mainstream, Manchester's Black dancers were the first to interpret the sounds that Chicago DJs such as Ron Hardy and Frankie Knuckles were playing across the Atlantic. They did so in clubs like Moss Side's The Reno, Black-owned establishments that operated from the margins while acting as incubators for the Black culture that in turn fed into mainstream British life.\n\nAs the tumult of Margaret Thatcher's first term took hold, Black British people were confronted by a country that was becoming more hostile to their presence. Far-right groups marched through immigrant areas and made substantial gains at the ballot box. Mainstream politicians, including Thatcher, weaponised race in a way no other prominent politician had done before. But in 1981, thousands took to the streets, causing unrest that spread around the country, from Bristol to Bradford, as a whole generation rejected what little they were being offered in Britain. This was a time of conflict, not just in the Falklands but here, on the home front, in cities and towns up and down the country, wherever Black Britons were found.\n\nIn many - but by no means all - cases, the protagonists in these stories are the children of Windrush . Their parents - or in some cases, grandparents - came to Britain in that great wave of immigration that reshaped Britain in the postwar era. Their parents might have felt they were British because of their new citizenship, but once they got to the UK, they found they were \"West Indian\", a catch-all term that no one from the Caribbean would use. Their children were in a different position - yes, they were born in Britain but the question that hung over them was: did that make them British?\n\nOther Black Britons have a different origin story. Their parents weren't from the Caribbean or Africa. Neither were their grandparents nor, in many cases, great-grandparents. In Liverpool and Cardiff , we find communities with roots dating back to before slavery was abolished across the British empire in the 1830s. These communities were the original multicultural Britain, and they often faced hostility that saw them segregated and attacked. Their stories are hiding in plain sight.\n\nFor many years, London was where the majority of Black British people lived - hardly surprising given its economic power and the opportunities it offered. Notting Hill, Ladbroke Grove, Hackney, Peckham and Brent: all over the capital Black communities were growing and adjusting to life in Britain. But that is changing. The last census showed that, for the first time since ethnicity was included in 1991, the majority of Black British people live outside the capital.\n\nAs these communities develop, it's becoming increasingly unlikely they'll see themselves represented in popular culture. After the watershed moment of the global Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement in 2020, a difficult and stilted conversation about race was forced in the UK. The creative industries tried - often cynically - to address longstanding absences in their collections or portfolios where Black British art should have been. Books, TV shows and films were commissioned and became part of a cultural wave that broke in the wake of BLM.\n\nSeries about frustrated creatives ( Dreaming Whilst Black ), opulent family sagas ( Riches ), Black kids in public schools ( Boarders ), sci-fi films set on dystopian housing estates ( The Kitchen ), award-winning gang tales ( Top Boy ), mould-breaking urban drama ( Blue Story ), unique accounts of trauma and creativity ( I May Destroy You ), Black women navigating love and life ( Queenie ) - there have been so many, yet every single one of those shows or films is set in London or is about Londoners. These aren't Black British stories; they are part of an ever increasing Black London canon. For commissioners and editors, London is the Black story. But for me and thousands of others, it isn't - and never could be. The Black London experience doesn't map neatly on to every Black British experience. There are similarities and staples - food, language, music, hair products - but what makes the experiences different is history.\n\nI've found that as soon as you widen the parameters of Black British culture beyond the capital, there's an untapped reserve to draw from. There are stories that make us reassess moments in our recent history; by examining them, we can understand ourselves and our impact on culture and life in the country as a whole. That reassessment is necessary.\n\nJust as I was finishing my book, new research was released showing that 50% of Britons couldn't name one Black British historical figure. The UK, the authors said, knew \"shockingly little\" about its own Black history. We've had an important wave of corrective histories from David Olusoga, Jason Okundaye, Jim Pines, June Givanni, Ferdinand Dennis, Stella Dadzie, Paterson Joseph, Hakim Adi, Marika Sherwood and Stephen Bourne, but clearly we need more. Perhaps one way of addressing this lack of cut-through is to make these stories truly Black and British - rooting them in locations that have been overlooked, in areas that people don't think of as Black. Maybe then more British people will pay attention to the history of this small but important island and think of Black history as having taken place in their own towns, cities or parishes, as well as in London.\n\nSign up to Inside Saturday\n\nThe only way to get a look behind the scenes of the Saturday magazine.

The journey sent me into dusty archives and on internet trawls searching for names scrawled down on yellowed paper. I spoke to people at the centre of extraordinary events who've never been asked about them. I managed to get hold of some interviewees a few months before they died and discovered that many others I wanted to speak to had already passed on. This history might have been staring us in the face, but it's fragile.\n\nThere are so many more stories waiting to be unearthed, in cities like Nottingham and Belfast, and towns including Luton and Plymouth. Black history is everywhere on these islands. Without Black people in Wigan, Bradford, Ambleside and Wolverhampton, the country we live in and the culture it has produced would look completely different. What I've discovered made me reconsider what I thought Black Britain was and is, what it can encompass and where it might go next.\n\nThis is an edited ex tract from We Were There, which is published by Bodley Head on 17 April .

Among their number were dozens of Black northern soul fans who influenced the scene and navigated the late 70s in Britain, a time when the far right was on the rise.\n\nBradford The wrongful arrest and conviction in 1978 of George Lindo, a textile worker from Bradford, triggered an international campaign for his release. At the same time, an American film crew came to the UK to record the reality of life in Britain for its Black residents. The film they made, Blacks Britannica - which captured some of the Lindo campaign - would be banned and censored but its warning proved prophetic.\n\nBirmingham As a moral panic about \"Black muggers\" and Rastafarians spread in 1979, an academic from Jamaica called Stuart Hall turned the lens around on the media, including the BBC, and accused British journalists of being complicit in the hugely negative coverage Black Britons received. His main inspiration would be the world outside his door in Birmingham, especially the multicultural area of Handsworth.\n\nLiverpool In 1981, violent unrest moved around the country, leaving many city centres looking like war zones after clashes between Black communities and the police. Unemployment, poverty and policing fuelled the disturbances in Liverpool, where documentary-maker Bea Freeman captured the thoughts of Black scousers who worked with her on landmark Channel 4 film They Haven't Done Nothing.\n\nWolverhampton In the city that was home to Enoch Powell, who became notorious after his \"Rivers of Blood\" speech, a new generation of Black British artists gathered. Their work reflected the chaotic and racist place Britain was in the early 1980s, but also questioned colonialism and the British empire. In October 1982, they invited other Black artists to a convention that became a launchpad for some of UK art's biggest names.\n\nManchester In Moss Side, behind a small black door, there was a club that acted as a hub connecting all parts of Black Manchester. The Reno welcomed guests including Muhammad Ali, and was linked to the Pan-African movement that had deep roots in the city. As Manchester was reshaped after the second world war, Manchester's Black population was caught up in the churn and the club became a refuge and incubator for Black British culture.\n\nThe countryside Away from the cities, Black Britons were trying to get a foothold as the 80s progressed. The Black Environment Network took on the complacency of politicians who refused to see rural racism as an issue, and included Ingrid Pollard whose artwork Pastoral Interlude tackled the reality for Black Britons who ventured into the green and pleasant land.\n\nCardiff Cardiff's Black population was one of the most significant in the country, known as the melting pot that had produced the pop star Shirley Bassey. But it had always been maligned, fetishised and - on occasions - attacked. In the late 80s, as an urban renewal plan sought to transform its Butetown area, a horrific murder saw a group of men framed and an entire community slandered.\n\nEdinburgh In January 1989, a Somali asylum seeker's murder in the Scottish capital appalled the small Black community north of the border. The Lothian Black Forum, which included the former Guardian columnist Gary Younge, campaigned to force the Scottish public and politicians to see the reality of life for Black Scots who were constantly told racism was the \"English disease\".\n\nLeeds and Sheffield As the 1980s drew to a close and Thatcher finally faced defeat, a new sound - created by working-class Black Britons - took hold of the rave scene. Bleep'n'bass emanated from places including Leeds and Sheffield. At the same time, a group of Black rugby league players, including Ellery Hanley and Martin Offiah, took the game to new heights and created the blueprint for modern sporting celebrities."

      "text": "Ravers, Rastas and rugby league stars: why the story of Black British culture is about more than just London\n\nBlack Britons altered the DNA of music, fashion and sport in this country. But why is it framed as a London story? Bradford-born writer Lanre Bakare explores how it reaches far beyond the capital - and farther back in time\n\nT he DVD slips into the loading tray, and I watch in hope rather than expectation. I've been told Tony Palmer's The Wigan Casino is the greatest ever depiction of a northern soul all-nighter, and I want to see it for myself. The film is a window into the underground scene that emerged in the 1970s, powered by soul records that had flopped years earlier. But I'm not interested in the music or the dancing - it's the crowd I've got an eye on.\n\nI spot what I'm after. A young man, glistening under the spotlight as he spins balletically in a yellow vest. Then another person catches my eye with his perfectly picked-out afro. It's a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment, so I rewind to check, and yes, it's true. A few minutes later, two girls clamber on to a coach, and one waves goodbye down the camera lens. Another boy squeezes through the crush at the front door. These young people are there for the same reason as everyone else: hard-to-find soul music that's perfectly crafted for dancing. But all of them stand out. They're different from the majority of the 1,200 dancers crammed into Wigan Casino. They're Black and British.\n\nSeeing those Black faces contradicted what I'd heard about the scene. Northern soul was about white working-class audiences falling in love with and coveting forgotten Black American music. My book We Were There started as a cultural expedition. I wanted to find something that wasn't supposed to exist: Black northern soul fans from the 1970s and 80s. When I tracked them down, I found their stories changed the way I thought not just about northern soul but about Britain at the start of the Thatcher era. I wanted to know why. I began to wonder what other stories I might have been mistold or had never explored at all - and what those stories could reveal to me, and others, about Britain then and now.\n\nNo European country has been changed by Black culture more than the UK. British music, fashion, sport, literature, TV and film have had their DNA altered by the influence of millions of people who have come to this small island from across the African diaspora. Our sounds, food, languages, intellect and sartorial choices have meshed with what was already here to create modern British culture. Some of our biggest Hollywood stars - Daniel Kaluuya, Cynthia Erivo, David Oyelowo, Letitia Wright, John Boyega - are Black; designers such as Nicholas Daley and Grace Wales Bonner transmit our styles globally; artists such as Sonia Boyce and John Akomfrah represent Britain on the biggest stages; much of England's men's football team is of Black heritage. Black British culture is an inseparable part of British culture.\n\nModern Black Britishness, which has spread and morphed into myriad forms, was forged in the late 1970s and the 80s, a time of huge ruptures and tumult - social, economic and political. Everywhere you looked, a battle was taking place, and every single gain had to be fought for: from Birmingham , where academics such as Stuart Hall and Rastafarians were taking on racism in the media, to Leeds and Sheffield, where pioneering music producers would express a new Black British confidence, and even to the countryside, where the Black Environment Network would battle for their own place in the UK's rural idyll.\n\nThis was a time of artistic and cultural creation unrivalled in the 20th century. A period when Black British culture flourished and contemporary British culture began to form. But our understanding of that influence is limited, and for many, it starts and ends in one place: London .\n\nI was born in the middle of the Thatcher era: 1984. My memories are fuzzy, softened by time; half-remembered fragments. Images of the poll tax riots, milk breaks at primary school, Ian Wright's gold tooth and Norman Lamont's eyebrows. But when I think of my home town of Bradford , there are details that come into focus. I can still run through the surnames like a Rolodex in my head: the Taylors, the Sarrs, the Davids, the Ibegbunas, the Ekongs, the Fehintolas, the Cookes, the Oakleys and the Braithwaites. The families you knew and the families you knew of - either by reputation or connection. I can still plot a chart that links the Black families in my area of Bradford: the faces, the cars, the haircuts, the living room furniture and the intellects.\n\nI left Bradford at the age of 18 and lived all over the UK - Liverpool , Newcastle, Sheffield, Bristol - in my early 20s before settling in London 14 years ago. In the capital, I've often been met by other Black people who express amazement at the fact Black life existed beyond the M25. Their responses weren't hostile - there was an anthropological desire to understand this otherness. My time away didn't make me reassess the Black culture I grew up with in Bradford, but it did make me question why it was so rarely acknowledged and little understood by everyone from the average person on the street to the institutions and centres of power in London.\n\nIf you want to understand the unrest that spread around the country in 1981, you'll most likely be pointed towards events in Brixton. While the south London neighbourhood was a centre of Black culture and resistance, it wasn't the only one - there were dozens around the UK, like in Liverpool, which had a different, older connection to the unrest. If you want to understand the far right and resistance to groups such as the National Front, you'll find documentary-makers, journalists and writers referring to the battle of Lewisham in 1977 as a moment, the moment, when communities came together to fight back against the provocative marches. The Rock Against Racism concert in London's Victoria Park one year later, where 100,000 people turned out to see the Clash, X-Ray Spex and Steel Pulse perform, is held up as the exemplar of when culture was used to counter rising fascism. If you want to understand the hostile relationship between the police and Black communities, you'll find accounts of the unrest at Notting Hill carnival in 1976 as the totemic battle when Black Britain fought back.\n\nAll those events were crucial, but all feed into a simplistic narrative about Black Britishness, which suggests that a group of people, most of whom arrived in the UK after the second world war, took to the streets to rebel - with anger and with violence. This consensus view allows little room for nuance, and obscures a bigger, more complex tapestry of life in Britain during the Thatcher years. There are people in my book whose families go back five or six generations in the UK - long before the Empire Windrush arrived; there are artists and authors, legal campaigners, feminists, ravers, rude boys and rugby league superstars.\n\nSome of the stories completely upend established cultural lore. Take the one about how house music came to the UK: the established narrative is that four intrepid Londoners - Danny Rampling, Johnny Walker, Nicky Holloway and Paul Oakenfold - went to Ibiza in 1987 and imported house music, providing the building blocks for the rave scene in the UK. But before acid house went mainstream, Manchester's Black dancers were the first to interpret the sounds that Chicago DJs such as Ron Hardy and Frankie Knuckles were playing across the Atlantic.

Far-right groups marched through immigrant areas and made substantial gains at the ballot box. Mainstream politicians, including Thatcher, weaponised race in a way no other prominent politician had done before. But in 1981, thousands took to the streets, causing unrest that spread around the country, from Bristol to Bradford, as a whole generation rejected what little they were being offered in Britain. This was a time of conflict, not just in the Falklands but here, on the home front, in cities and towns up and down the country, wherever Black Britons were found.\n\nIn many - but by no means all - cases, the protagonists in these stories are the children of Windrush . Their parents - or in some cases, grandparents - came to Britain in that great wave of immigration that reshaped Britain in the postwar era. Their parents might have felt they were British because of their new citizenship, but once they got to the UK, they found they were \"West Indian\", a catch-all term that no one from the Caribbean would use. Their children were in a different position - yes, they were born in Britain but the question that hung over them was: did that make them British?\n\nOther Black Britons have a different origin story. Their parents weren't from the Caribbean or Africa. Neither were their grandparents nor, in many cases, great-grandparents. In Liverpool and Cardiff , we find communities with roots dating back to before slavery was abolished across the British empire in the 1830s.

The white audience has taken you away from them.'\" This was Whitney Houston , reflecting on the first significant setback of her career, when she was booed at the 1989 Soul Train Awards. By that stage, she had already won 11 American Music Awards, two Grammys, achieved the biggest-selling debut album by a female artist in history and a record-breaking seven consecutive US No 1 singles. But, despite all this success, some black radio stations refused to play her records, and opponents, including the Rev Al Sharpton, labelled her \"Whitey\" Houston. For some, she was simply Not Black Enough.\n\nKevin Macdonald's new documentary, Whitney, doesn't suggest insufficient blackness as a contributing factor in Houston's tragic death in 2012. It points the finger more at her family, revealing her childhood sexual abuse (allegedly by her cousin Dee Dee Warwick) and scrolling through a gallery of money-grubbing, vicariously ambitious, gravy train-riding relatives. But Nick Broomfield's earlier documentary, Whitney: Can I Be Me , does locate Houston's demise specifically in her conflicted racial and sexual identity , starting with that hurtful night at the Soul Train Awards. \"I don't think she ever recovered from it,\" says her saxophonist Kirk Whalum in Broomfield's documentary. \"It was one of those boxes that was checked, that when she ultimately perished it was because of those boxes.\"\n\nLooking at today's landscape, where African-American music dominates the culture, it's hard to believe Not Black Enough was ever a life-threatening condition. But where a white artist can \"sell out\" their fanbase at worst, it has always been different for black ones. As Ta-Nehisi Coates recently put it in The Atlantic , \"the gift of black music, of black art, is unlike any other in America, because it is not simply a matter of singular talent, or even of tradition, or lineage, but something more grand and monstrous\". His point was that African-American musicians are expected to represent more than simply themselves; they must represent their culture and their history. \"The gift can never wholly belong to a singular artist, free of expectation and scrutiny, because the gift is no more solely theirs than the suffering that produced it.\"\n\nHouston was pretty much engineered to be Not Black Enough from the start. She began with all the right credentials. She grew up in Newark, New Jersey, in the era of race riots, though she was hardly a child of the ghetto (she went to a private Catholic girls' school). Her musical ancestry was very much rooted in the soul-gospel tradition, via mother Cissy Houston, cousin Dionne Warwick and honorary aunt Aretha Franklin. But when she signed to Arista Records, aged 19, CEO Clive Davis consciously moulded her into a white-friendly pop princess. \"Anything that was too 'black-sounding' was sent back to the studio,\" Arista's head of promotion says in Whitney: Can I Be Me. \"We didn't want a female James Brown\".\n\nInstead, it was syrupy ballads and perky dance-pop, complemented by innocuous music videos featuring as many white dancers as black ones, the better to appeal to MTV. In interviews, Houston's persona could be described as colourless in every sense. Commercially it worked a treat, but \"to the black ear, these records did not have a natural feel,\" Arista promoter Doug Daniel tells Broomfield. \"For the black audience, the perspective in the community was that Whitney had sold out.\"\n\nHouston began trying to put that right the very night of the Soul Train Awards. It was there she met future husband Bobby Brown - then the epitome of a virile, street-credible black man. She also broke out of her mould and began to record music more to her own tastes. For her third album, 1990's I'm Your Baby Tonight, she worked with producers LA and Babyface and Stevie Wonder, and sounded funkier, sexier and altogether blacker. But throughout her career, Houston danced awkwardly around issues of race. She was firmly anti-apartheid South Africa and was the first major artist to perform there after Nelson Mandela's election. She went stratospheric with The Bodyguard, but the movie barely acknowledged the interracial aspect of her romance with Kevin Costner, and scored her a huge hit with, of all things, a Dolly Parton cover (I Will Always Love You).\n\nThere was also Houston's celebrated rendition of The Star-Spangled Banner at the 1991 Super Bowl, 10 days after the start of the first Gulf war. African Americans have traditionally viewed the national anthem with ambivalence. There was that problematic suppressed third verse for starters (\"No refuge could save the hireling and slave / From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave\"). The song has prompted black protests from the Black Power salutes of the 1968 Olympics to Colin Kaepernick in 2016, but Houston gave it her unironic all, backed by brass, flags and fighter jets. She captured the patriotic moment so well, her rendition was released as a charity single for the US military.\n\nOne observer in Macdonald's Whitney film frames Houston's race issues in terms of \"double consciousness\". The notion, first coined by WEB Du Bois in 1897, refers to the dual mindset held by marginalised peoples such as African Americans in the US, who must both retain their own black identity and also see themselves through the eyes of their oppressors. \"Two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder,\" Du Bois wrote. Some would go even further and say Houston's status as a woman counts as a triple consciousness. This \"insider-outsider\" mindset was regarded as an internal conflict but also a source of creative energy. Identify too much with one side, however, and you are Not Black Enough.\n\nIn retrospect, you have to wonder why Whitney was singled out. Many African-American artists have crossed over into more mainstream, traditionally \"white\" success without similar consequences - often because of where they've come from. In Houston's era, crossover artists such as Diana Ross, Stevie Wonder and Tina Turner had paid their dues, starting at the bottom. Prince could stray into rock ballads such as Purple Rain on the back of deep funk credentials. By contrast, apart from her famous relatives, Houston was discouraged from mentioning her past by Arista. Even Michael Jackson - Houston's only real equivalent - had evolved from a solidly black Motown tradition before the public's eyes, although his physical transformations spoke of his own internal battles with his identity, racial and otherwise.\n\nThe ground was already starting shift back in 1989, albeit too late for Whitney. While she was being hounded at the Soul Train Awards, writer Trey Ellis wrote an influential essay on what he called the New Black Aesthetic. Ellis identified himself as a \"cultural mulatto\": educated, liberated by the civil rights gains of his parents' generation, and operating freely in a multiracial mix of cultures.\n\n\"We no longer need to deny or suppress any part of our complicated and sometimes contradictory cultural baggage to please either white people or black,\" he wrote. It was OK to like Jim Morrison as well as Toni Morrison. Ellis pointed out black culture's growing cultural dominance, from Spike Lee and Eddie Murphy in the movies, to Prince and hip-hop in music - all of whom were universally popular but true to themselves, \"true to the black\". By contrast, he singled out Whitney Houston and Lionel Richie as \"cultural-mulatto, assimilationist nightmares; neutered mutations instead of thriving hybrids. Trying to please both worlds instead of themselves they end up truly pleasing neither.\"\n\nToday's black artists operate with the freedom Houston dreamed of, but they are never immune from scrutiny. Witness Beyoncé, whose stance in the early 2000s was seen as carefully apolitical by critics, but who suddenly rediscovered her blackness in the Black Lives Matter era and came out celebrating hot sauce and \"Jackson 5 nostrils\" in 2016's Formation. Beyoncé had sung her own, Houston-influenced Star-Spangled Banner to the Super Bowl audience in 2004; when she returned for the 2016 half-time show, she practically gave them a Black Power military drill.\n\nThe extent of the jolt was registered by Saturday Night Live's brilliant sketch The Day Beyoncé Turned Black , in which white America's realisation of the singer's race triggers panic in the streets. As Jeff Guo put it in the Washington Post, \"Beyoncé waited until black politics was so undeniably commercial that she could make a market out of it.\" But Beyoncé and Jay-Z have continued to push the line. Their recent video for their joint track APES**T , filmed in the Louvre, turns it around and accuses European cultural history of being Not Black Enough.\n\nAnd look how far Kanye West has pushed that line recently: all the way to claiming that slavery was \"a choice\" and brandishing his signed MAGA hat with pride . If that's how far you have to go - to the edges of white nationalism - to earn a Not Black Enough charge these days, perhaps that's a sign of progress. As Ta Nehisi Coates scathingly observed, \"West calls his struggle the right to be a 'free thinker', and he is, indeed, championing a kind of freedom - a white freedom, freedom without consequence, freedom without criticism, freedom to be proud and ignorant; freedom to profit off a people in one moment and abandon them in the next.\"\n\nHowever that freedom is used, Whitney Houston is undoubtedly one of those who helped earn it, and she undoubtedly paid the price for it.\n\nWhitney is out now"

      "text": "A Festival That Celebrates Black Culture Taught Me How To Belong\n\nFounder of Marcha do Orgulho Crespo Brasil and Hot Pente\n\n\"i lost a whole continent.\n\na whole continent from my memory.\n\nunlike all other hyphenated americans\n\nmy hyphen is made of blood. feces. bone.\n\nwhen africa says hello\n\nmy mouth is a heartbreak\n\nbecause i have nothing in my tongue\n\nto answer her.\n\ni don't know how to say hello to my mother.\"\n\nI recently discovered the writings of American poet Nayyirah Waheed , who publishes poems on her I nstagram that have such depth that they immediately touch us and alert us to matters of self-esteem, identity and ancestry. Their message and subtleties get me thinking about a very current issue: belonging.\n\nMuch is being said about the importance of knowing our origins and feeling connected to a specific culture, tradition, people. But how can we think about origin, descent and heritage when we're talking about a population marked by a brutal slavery process that breaks any memory of belonging and preservation for future generations?\n\nI think that we Afro-Brazilians, moved by a yearning for belonging, are taking the lead and creating initiatives in various areas of activity. These initiatives drive and promote re(union) and rethink this forced absence of an us , which goes from non-representativeness to the project of genocide of the black population.\n\nThere are black collectives and fronts, movements with the goal of creating, in the diaspora, possible paths for empathetic dialogue-not always successfully-about agendas that are important to us. Existing the way we are and want to is the most important of these dialogues.\n\n\"Afropunk is one of the most important contemporary references in terms of black aesthetics, empowerment and anti-racism movement.\"\n\nSimilarly, Afropunk was also born in this context of absence, of non-visibility and of non-belonging. The largest black music festival in the world, now present in Paris, London, Brooklyn, Atlanta and Johannesburg, was created in 2005 by black youths who didn't feel represented in the American punk rock scene.\n\nAfter the documentary Afropunk , produced by Matthew Morgan and directed by James Spooner, in 2003, the movement gained visibility and became an annual festival. It's also an alternative platform that connects black people from all around the world through their productions in music, art, film, photography, behavior and fashion.\n\nThe first edition of Afropunk Fest was held at the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM), in New York. It was organized independently, with concerts, film screenings and an audience eager to share their passions and concerns, like the promotion of black identity and the racism in American society. Over the years, the festival brought to its stage names like Public Enemy, Mos Def, Blitz The Ambassador, Macy Gray, Erykah Badu and Brazilian rapper Karol Conka. Heavy!\n\nMore than a festival with black performers for a predominantly black audience, Afropunk has been consolidating itself as one of the most important contemporary references in terms of black aesthetics, empowerment and anti-racism movement.\n\nAccording to Lou Constant-Desportes, editor-in-chief of Afropunk.com, the hashtag \"We The People,\" used in the latest Paris and London editions, is a way of saying that we are dedicated to fighting together for our values and our freedom. We bring the community together to celebrate ourselves and our cultures, while at the same time standing up against injustice and oppression.\n\nLou, who recently visited Brazil, says he feels very inspired when he sees how young Afro-Brazilian artists and activists are organizing themselves to create alternative platforms with their own hands. \"If you don't have money or access to mainstream platforms, you find other ways to make it happen, create and promote your own events, your own art, fighting for what you believe. That's what we call D.I.Y. - Do It Yourself, and it's very important for Afropunk.\"\n\nBaiana cool hunter and blogger Magá Moura (pictured above) already participated in previous editions of the festival and, in Brazil, is a reference of what is known as \"close.\" For her, in recent years and because of the demonstrations of activism, leadership and spaces that are progressively taken up by black people, we are already in the midst of that movement.\n\nThis whole \"close\" scene, the aesthetics, the display, it means more than that for us, black men and women. We are at a place of empowerment, of feeling beautiful, of feeling represented and seen. How long have we gone by unseen? And Afropunk, even if it isn't happening in Brazil, is strengthening this and bringing us that power and that inspiration for us to feel beautiful, wear our hair in whatever way we want-whether natural, artificial or colored. For us to express ourselves the way we feel most comfortable and true to who we are.\n\nIn Brazil, where black population is a majority, it's paradoxical how this view of the black body still generates endless physical and psychological violence, daily ridicule armed by inferiority and prejudice at school and in the workplace. A view that arises from the structural racism present in Brazilian society, affecting everyone from black power activists to black teenagers from the suburbs.\n\nEven so, we are experiencing a period in which many of these bodies have awoken to the use of their aesthetics and self-esteem as a body of protest. Whether it's with hair or with black culture signs worn as a medium for standing up to racism and/or a way to reconnect with our origins-like our ancestors, who carried in their bodies the memory of their dances, rituals and traditions with the goal of preserving their identity and culture.\n\nLike Magá, Portuguese photographer and creative director Abdel Tavares is a colorful figure who does not go unnoticed. His red hat is his signature, a trademark he carries since he bought the first one at a carnival store in Lisbon. \"For me, the looks I get make no difference, because what I wear is really out there. For some people, a turban, for example, continues to be a target of racism. And I think that we really have to be different, display our culture, because it's in those differences that we find all colors.\"\n\nFor him, as the creator of the Black Fashion Stars blog dedicated to African culture and black people from around the world, Afropunk is an event that represents, above all, freedom and celebration.\n\n\"Freedom is expressed in the way these African bodies are breaking with set standards and creating possible futures.\"\n\nFreedom is expressed in the way these African bodies are breaking with set standards and creating possible futures. From the point of view of identity itself and of their culture, they reinvent another reality today and tomorrow. Afrofuturism . A celebration of blackness that respects the individualities, attitudes and subjectivities strengthened by the collective power.\n\nWe The People have the will to heal the divisions that threaten to crumble our dreams to dust. We believe in the resurrection of the creative power of our diversity. We open our hearts and minds, and dance to the rhythm of a new future. Together.\n\nEnglish designer and hair stylist Mariette Immaculate travels the world in search of design, music, fashion and lifestyles. \"I like this event because I can see a lot of creations. It's great to have a space like this, where we can express ourselves together, be together, make friends. Afropunk is a community, and here we can take in what so many people have been doing, expressing. It's great to see that the movement is growing and that you can find creative people from different cities around the world. It's important for black people to be inspired by other black people, to understand things that are connected to them.\"\n\nThe identification that black Brazilian youth feels with this event today serves as encouragement and as a connection to what is produced around the world. And this happens because of the way we, as black people, are loving ourselves and subverting the notion of beauty that we were given.\n\nThis positive impact also challenges the myth that we are a democratically racial country, in the way #SomosTodosHumanos (We Are All Human) wants to de-legitimize #BlackLivesMatter. It is not about a dispute on who matters the most, but about acknowledging and paying attention to the fact that for every ten people murdered in Brazil, seven are black.\n\n\"Brazil is one of the countries that follows our editorial content more closely on social media. So, we know there's a big community waiting for us and we feel very connected to its creativity and its struggles,\" says Lou, who can't confirm confirm any dates but does reveal that his team has been working to stage an edition of Afropunk in our neck of the woods very soon.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "On Dashikis and Face Paint: Decolonizing the African Culture Line\n\nA bifocaled Pan-Africanist gripped by grace.\n\nPhoto: Krista Schlueter / BET\n\nRecently, a post written by writer Zipporah Gene posed the question, \"Can Black people culturally appropriate one another? The piece accused African Americans of committing cultural appropriation in the same way white people do. Needless to say, her piece has caused quite the stir on my Facebook timeline. Though well intentioned, she missed the mark tremendously. By asserting that Black people are guilty of the same appropriation that whites are, the author failed to factor in the forced dislocation of an entire population of African people and dismissed their attempts at reconfiguring any semblance of African identity, which brings me to my thesis:When native African people restrict the cultural involvement of others based on their Diasporic location, they implicitly perpetuate the same colonialism that separated Africans from Africa.\n\nCultural appropriation is defined as the adoption or use of elements of one culture by members of a different culture as a largely negative phenomenon. In Gene's piece, she states that Black Americans, because of their misuse of African fashion and tribal markings, are responsible for the same type of cultural appropriation that white people are. Though well-meaning, she has a very eurocentric way of looking at things, including her own people. However, this isn't unique to her. Quite honestly, it's a problem that many people across the diaspora have when attempting to make cultural distinctions among themselves.\n\nThe reason this piece garnered so much support is simple -- colonialism. Attempting to define someone else's Africanness by where they fall on the globe is a direct byproduct of the colonialism that removed Black people from Africa in the first place. It is deeply misguided and disrespectful to disqualify non-native Africans from partaking in African customs and practices solely because of their dislocation from the continent. Such narrow and exclusionary definitions -- cultural and otherwise -- reinforce the colonial separation people across the Diaspora are still grappling with today.\n\nThis line of reasoning shames non-native Africans for a problem that they did not start. Black Americans, Afro-Brazilians, West Indians, and others are not responsible for their dislocation from the Motherland. Need we be reminded that during the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade, approximately 11,863,000 Africans were shipped across the Atlantic, with a death rate during the Middle Passage reducing this number by 10-20 percent. As a result between 9.6 and 10.8 million Africans arrived in the Americas.\n\nDo these facts make those who traveled that tumultuous middle passage and their ancestors less African? Of course not! Black people have just as much stake in the continent as native Africans do. This includes access to traditional African religions, customs and rituals, and most certainly includes the right to wear a dashiki.\n\nOur relationship to African practices directly correlates to how we identify with the continent itself, both ideologically and culturally. Many Africans -- both on and off the continent -- tend to identify more with their specific region than with the continent as a whole. As a result, they define their differences based on the territorial demarcations that they have known all their lives. However, unbeknownst to them, most of these demarcations are colonial in nature and were imposed on them by white powers.\n\nWhen we use these same distinctions to isolate one Black culture from the next, we are reinforcing the white supremacy that begat it. This becomes clear when engaging in conversations regarding intracultural appropriation.\n\n(Photo: Erica Jones/ LolaWho.com)\n\nTo be clear, appropriation is a viable concern and it is problematic when we don't take time to educate one another on the the customs we are choosing to adopt. In the states, Black people, like white people, benefit from American privilege. As we all know, some Black Americans use their privilege to disregard and lump the diversity of Africa into stereotypical slogans and catchphrases. Some utilize this same privilege even more by not educating themselves on their own cultures and customs. And although this is indicative of a certain kind of privilege, it isn't appropriation.\n\nWhen Black Americans and others within the Diaspora employ aspects of African culture, they do so in an attempt to associate themselves with their long lost homeland. Some do this more consciously than others, but regardless of the surface-level motivation, it is all rooted in a genuine desire to connect with a stolen legacy.\n\nConversely, first generation Africans in America have the privilege of identification and access to customs that Black Americans and others across the Diaspora do not due to their native affiliations. When this association to Africa is leveraged to exclude other Africans (native or not), this claim to relative fame only promotes a false sense of entitlement to Africa that is based on location instead of ancestry.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "How World War I Sparked The Artistic Movement That Transformed Black America\n\nExperts in academia, providing fact-based analysis of issues for the public.\n\nBy Elizabeth J. West , Georgia State University/The Conversati on\n\nThough we often discuss World War I through the lens of history, we occasionally do it through literature. When we do, we'll invariably go to the famous trilogy of Hemingway, Faulkner and Fitzgerald - the authors most representative of America's iconic Lost Generation . Their work is said to reflect a mood that emerged from the ashes of a war that, with its trail of carnage , left survivors around the world with a despairing vision of life, self and nation.\n\nThe anxiety and hopelessness of the Lost Generation has become embedded in literary and cultural history. But for black artists, writers and thinkers, the war meant something entirely different: It spawned a transformation of the way African-Americans imagined themselves, their past and their future.\n\nWith Africa as a source of inspiration, a \"New Negro\" emerged out of the ruins of the Great War - not broken and disenchanted, but possessed with a new sense of self, one shaped from bold, unapologetically black models.\n\nAaron Douglas. \"Aspects of Negro Life: From Slavery to Reconstruction.\" Oil on canvas, 1934. The New York Public Library, Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, Art and Artifacts Division.\n\nBefore World War I, African-American literature depicted stoic, but constrained, black protagonists. They emulated European codes of class and respectability while rejecting any sort of African legacy or inheritance. In other words, they talked like white people, dressed like white people and accepted the narrative that white men were the source of America's greatness.\n\nFrom the most well-known 19th-century African-American writer, Frederick Douglass, to his less remembered contemporary, Alexander Crummell, literary black advocacy or racial uplift too often rested on this approach.\n\nStill, in the years leading up to World War I, there were rumblings of the \"New Negro\" archetype. For example, in Paul Laurence Dunbar's 1902 novel \"The Sport of the Gods\" and Pauline Hopkins' serialized novel \"Hagar's Daughter,\" we see restless, dissatisfied young people who have no desire to become shuffling, servile second-class citizens.\n\nThis defiance, however, would not become widespread in African-American literature until the end of the war.\n\nBlack soldiers abroad during World War I experienced a type of freedom and mobility unattainable back home. In cities from London to Paris, many, for the first time, could travel without the worry of being denied equal lodging accommodations or admission to entertainment venues.\n\nOnce they returned stateside, they became increasingly impatient with Jim Crow laws and codes of racial discrimination. Life, they realized, didn't have to be this way. In a nation that was now half a century beyond slavery, the fever spread among a new generation of blacks.\n\nA group of soldiers pose from the 93rd Division's 369th Infantry Regiment, which was nicknamed the 'Harlem Hellfighters.' US National Archives\n\nIn the war's aftermath, racial tensions heightened - a reflection of this mood. The summer of 1919 was known as the \" Red Summer \" for the number of race riots that erupted around the country, with one of the worst in Chicago , where 38 people died.\n\nAnd in black literature, African-American characters no longer looked to the white man - or his nations - as models of civilization. In his 1925 anthology entitled \" The New Negro ,\" writer, philosopher and Howard University professor Alain Locke has been credited with marshaling in the era we now know as the Harlem Renaissance. Locke, in his text, called on a generation of emerging black writers, artists and activists to look to Africa and to black folk culture in the United States and the Americas as a way to mine and explore a new strand of humanity.\n\nWe see this in Langston Hughes' poetry; in \" The Negro Speaks of Rivers ,\" he heralds Africa as source of creativity and cultural grounding:\n\nUnlike the emerging literati of the Lost Generation, blacks, for the most part, weren't angst-ridden over a post-war world devoid of meaning: they had never internalized the myth of America as a shining \"city upon a hill.\" For them, the war brought no end or loss, no disillusionment or void.\n\nClaude McKay. Wikimedia Commons\n\nWe see this difference if we compare Hemingway's protagonist Jake in \" The Sun Also Rises \" (1926) to Claude McKay's protagonist in \" Home to Harlem \" (1928), also named Jake. Unlike Hemingway's lost, sullen and impotent hero who can't find his way home, McKay's Jake happily traverses Europe for a period after the war until he realizes he yearns for home.\n\nWhile life is still a struggle and racism persists, McKay's hero looks to the future with hope; he returns to Harlem where he relishes the many shades of black and brown beauties that he missed in Europe. McKay's Jake immerses himself in a black world of love and laughter - a place that loudly celebrates life. He becomes inspired not by the readings and ideals of white thinkers and writers, but through black prototypes in and beyond America. His West Indian co-worker introduces him to Toussaint L'Ouverture and Jean-Jaques Dessalines, the black heroes of the Haitian Revolution , and to the history of great African empires dating back to antiquity.\n\nIn the literary works of black women, a new ethos also emerged.

      "text": "A Festival That Celebrates Black Culture Taught Me How To Belong\n\nFounder of Marcha do Orgulho Crespo Brasil and Hot Pente\n\n\"i lost a whole continent.\n\na whole continent from my memory.\n\nunlike all other hyphenated americans\n\nmy hyphen is made of blood. feces. bone.\n\nwhen africa says hello\n\nmy mouth is a heartbreak\n\nbecause i have nothing in my tongue\n\nto answer her.\n\ni don't know how to say hello to my mother.\"\n\nI recently discovered the writings of American poet Nayyirah Waheed , who publishes poems on her I nstagram that have such depth that they immediately touch us and alert us to matters of self-esteem, identity and ancestry. Their message and subtleties get me thinking about a very current issue: belonging.\n\nMuch is being said about the importance of knowing our origins and feeling connected to a specific culture, tradition, people. But how can we think about origin, descent and heritage when we're talking about a population marked by a brutal slavery process that breaks any memory of belonging and preservation for future generations?\n\nI think that we Afro-Brazilians, moved by a yearning for belonging, are taking the lead and creating initiatives in various areas of activity. These initiatives drive and promote re(union) and rethink this forced absence of an us , which goes from non-representativeness to the project of genocide of the black population.\n\nThere are black collectives and fronts, movements with the goal of creating, in the diaspora, possible paths for empathetic dialogue-not always successfully-about agendas that are important to us. Existing the way we are and want to is the most important of these dialogues.\n\n\"Afropunk is one of the most important contemporary references in terms of black aesthetics, empowerment and anti-racism movement.\"\n\nSimilarly, Afropunk was also born in this context of absence, of non-visibility and of non-belonging. The largest black music festival in the world, now present in Paris, London, Brooklyn, Atlanta and Johannesburg, was created in 2005 by black youths who didn't feel represented in the American punk rock scene.\n\nAfter the documentary Afropunk , produced by Matthew Morgan and directed by James Spooner, in 2003, the movement gained visibility and became an annual festival. It's also an alternative platform that connects black people from all around the world through their productions in music, art, film, photography, behavior and fashion.\n\nThe first edition of Afropunk Fest was held at the Brooklyn Academy of Music (BAM), in New York. It was organized independently, with concerts, film screenings and an audience eager to share their passions and concerns, like the promotion of black identity and the racism in American society. Over the years, the festival brought to its stage names like Public Enemy, Mos Def, Blitz The Ambassador, Macy Gray, Erykah Badu and Brazilian rapper Karol Conka. Heavy!\n\nMore than a festival with black performers for a predominantly black audience, Afropunk has been consolidating itself as one of the most important contemporary references in terms of black aesthetics, empowerment and anti-racism movement.\n\nAccording to Lou Constant-Desportes, editor-in-chief of Afropunk.com, the hashtag \"We The People,\" used in the latest Paris and London editions, is a way of saying that we are dedicated to fighting together for our values and our freedom. We bring the community together to celebrate ourselves and our cultures, while at the same time standing up against injustice and oppression.\n\nLou, who recently visited Brazil, says he feels very inspired when he sees how young Afro-Brazilian artists and activists are organizing themselves to create alternative platforms with their own hands. \"If you don't have money or access to mainstream platforms, you find other ways to make it happen, create and promote your own events, your own art, fighting for what you believe. That's what we call D.I.Y. - Do It Yourself, and it's very important for Afropunk.\"\n\nBaiana cool hunter and blogger Magá Moura (pictured above) already participated in previous editions of the festival and, in Brazil, is a reference of what is known as \"close.\" For her, in recent years and because of the demonstrations of activism, leadership and spaces that are progressively taken up by black people, we are already in the midst of that movement.\n\nThis whole \"close\" scene, the aesthetics, the display, it means more than that for us, black men and women. We are at a place of empowerment, of feeling beautiful, of feeling represented and seen. How long have we gone by unseen? And Afropunk, even if it isn't happening in Brazil, is strengthening this and bringing us that power and that inspiration for us to feel beautiful, wear our hair in whatever way we want-whether natural, artificial or colored. For us to express ourselves the way we feel most comfortable and true to who we are.\n\nIn Brazil, where black population is a majority, it's paradoxical how this view of the black body still generates endless physical and psychological violence, daily ridicule armed by inferiority and prejudice at school and in the workplace. A view that arises from the structural racism present in Brazilian society, affecting everyone from black power activists to black teenagers from the suburbs.\n\nEven so, we are experiencing a period in which many of these bodies have awoken to the use of their aesthetics and self-esteem as a body of protest. Whether it's with hair or with black culture signs worn as a medium for standing up to racism and/or a way to reconnect with our origins-like our ancestors, who carried in their bodies the memory of their dances, rituals and traditions with the goal of preserving their identity and culture.\n\nLike Magá, Portuguese photographer and creative director Abdel Tavares is a colorful figure who does not go unnoticed. His red hat is his signature, a trademark he carries since he bought the first one at a carnival store in Lisbon. \"For me, the looks I get make no difference, because what I wear is really out there. For some people, a turban, for example, continues to be a target of racism. And I think that we really have to be different, display our culture, because it's in those differences that we find all colors.\"\n\nFor him, as the creator of the Black Fashion Stars blog dedicated to African culture and black people from around the world, Afropunk is an event that represents, above all, freedom and celebration.\n\n\"Freedom is expressed in the way these African bodies are breaking with set standards and creating possible futures.\"\n\nFreedom is expressed in the way these African bodies are breaking with set standards and creating possible futures. From the point of view of identity itself and of their culture, they reinvent another reality today and tomorrow. Afrofuturism . A celebration of blackness that respects the individualities, attitudes and subjectivities strengthened by the collective power.\n\nWe The People have the will to heal the divisions that threaten to crumble our dreams to dust. We believe in the resurrection of the creative power of our diversity. We open our hearts and minds, and dance to the rhythm of a new future. Together.\n\nEnglish designer and hair stylist Mariette Immaculate travels the world in search of design, music, fashion and lifestyles. \"I like this event because I can see a lot of creations. It's great to have a space like this, where we can express ourselves together, be together, make friends. Afropunk is a community, and here we can take in what so many people have been doing, expressing. It's great to see that the movement is growing and that you can find creative people from different cities around the world. It's important for black people to be inspired by other black people, to understand things that are connected to them.\"\n\nThe identification that black Brazilian youth feels with this event today serves as encouragement and as a connection to what is produced around the world. And this happens because of the way we, as black people, are loving ourselves and subverting the notion of beauty that we were given.\n\nThis positive impact also challenges the myth that we are a democratically racial country, in the way #SomosTodosHumanos (We Are All Human) wants to de-legitimize #BlackLivesMatter. It is not about a dispute on who matters the most, but about acknowledging and paying attention to the fact that for every ten people murdered in Brazil, seven are black.\n\n\"Brazil is one of the countries that follows our editorial content more closely on social media. So, we know there's a big community waiting for us and we feel very connected to its creativity and its struggles,\" says Lou, who can't confirm confirm any dates but does reveal that his team has been working to stage an edition of Afropunk in our neck of the woods very soon.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "20 Festival-Goers On What AFROPUNK Means To Black Culture\n\nVoices Editorial Fellow, The Huffington Post\n\nBlack Voices Editor/Senior Culture Reporter, HuffPost\n\nEnormous crowds of black hipsters, cool kids and trendsetters gathered in Commodore Barry Park in Brooklyn, New York this weekend for the 2015 AFROPUNK Music Festival.\n\nThe two-day festival, which celebrated its 10th year this summer, was filled with a celebration of black entertainment and style . Matthew Morgan, festival co-founder, founded AFROPUNK in 2005 as \"an alternative\" to other summer music festivals that he thought underrepresented people of color.\n\n\"It's an alternative view on our culture and music and things that are important to us,\" Morgan told the Huffington Post . This year's artist line-up included musical performances by New York natives Lenny Kravitz and Kelis, as well as Grace Jones, Lauryn Hill, and others.\n\nBut more than a music festival, AFROPUNK is a part of black culture . It is a place where black people are able to express the full diversity of their lived experiences. This year was no different, and festival-goers of all ages, colors, shapes and sizes were in attendance.\n\nHuffPost asked 20 of the rocking festival attendees to describe the music festival and what AFROPUNK means to black culture. Here are their responses:\n\n\"Black culture is in everything that we do in America and AFROPUNK is a very big representation of that.\"\n\n\"It provides a community for alternative kids: black, white, queer, however they define themselves.\"\n\n\"AFROPUNK gives us an opportunity to express our individuality without being concerned with what naysayers will say.\"\n\n\"It's a gathering of the creative minds.\"\n\n\"AFROPUNK is freedom, it allows people to express themselves\"\n\n\"A space to express ourselves. These types of space are far, few, and in between nowadays.\"\n\nNjamba: \"AFROPUNK to black culture means comfortability--a place where we can all come together and ourselves.\"\n\nNalaja: \"A way of life with music and art.\"\n\n\"AFROPUNK is about celebrating differences, and us becoming more comfortable with differences...when I think of pride I think of AFROPUNK as pride.\"\n\n\"Difference. Something for everyone to see we're different. We're not the same.\"\n\n\"To me I think it means home.\"\n\n\"AFROPUNK for black culture is a way to reflect and bring us all together.\"\n\n\"AFROPUNK is extremely important to black culture right now because it's one of the events that allows us to collectively gather in our own experience.\"\n\n\"AFROPUNK means liberation of expression to black culture. People are free to be themselves, wear whatever they want, do whatever they want, and feel accepted.\"\n\nJustin: \"AFROPUNK to black culture it's being able to be who you are unapologetically.\"\n\nAndre: \"Specifically marginalized folks within a marginalized group tend to feel even much more to be celebrated because we still recognize each other, and with recognition I feel comes a celebration and AFROPUNK is that.\"\n\n\"I think it's important because everything is on the platform where social issues are focused on art, in general it's focused on music. Everything is touched on where there's no limitation but it's all on a mutual level where it's welcoming so you're not offending anybody but you're making people aware of the things they need to be aware of and the diversity that's so necessary... There's no limitation. There's nobody telling you that you can't be who you are.\"\n\n\"I work with chapters of Black Lives Matter, the national organization of Black Trans Lives Matter... we're here to hold folks at AFROPUNK accountable to the black trans women that have passed... Something has to be done and it has to start at home. Our home is AFROPUNK. Our home is with quirky, weird black people that break the mold and expand what blackness can be.\"\n\n\"I think it's all about bringing people together. Like even though it's the Afrocentric culture, I'm seeing tons of different people, different artists, people from different cultures, people form different regions, people from different places and I love these things like AFROPUNK events because it brings people together.\"\n\n\"AFROPUNK is a redefining of stereotypes. We're reclaiming what has either been a negative connotation or recreating a new connotation to define our people.\"\n\n\"I think it's beautiful, I think it's an expression of who you can be, who you are and I think this is a place where I don't think it exists every single day so I think this is important for people to come and experience.\"\n\n\"It's important because we seldom get to see ourselves represented in this way. Now I'm understanding that punk is actually very much a black thing. I've always thought that it's white because that's what we've been taught. So for the first time in my life, I can honestly say that I identify myself as punk.\"\n\nAlso on HuffPost:\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Of Course Black History Month Is Worthy of Celebration!\n\nThe Ongoing Aftermath of the 2016 Election\n\nAnother February is upon us. This also means that, in various quarters of the nation, people will engage in various celebrations and acknowledgments of the history of people of African descent. To put it more bluntly, Black History Month will be all the rage for the next few weeks.\n\nFor those of you who are unaware of its origins, the tradition of Black History Month originated in 1926 when esteemed Black historian and journalist Dr. Carter G. Woodson created what was at the time referred to as Negro History Week. The purpose of this was to coordinate the teaching of Black history in public schools. Woodson is considered by many academics to be the father of Black history.\n\nWhile there were many Black studies departments and public organizations who engaged in month-long celebrations honoring individuals and events associated with Black culture, it was not until 1976 (the bicentennial) that Black History Month was officially designated by President Gerald Ford.\n\nIt should go without saying that Black History Month is indeed relevant. However, we still have a segment of people out there (including some people of color) who have taken issue with having such a celebration. The dissent is real. Therefore, for all you who take issue with the idea of Black History Month, hopefully the following will assist you in freeing your myopic mind.\n\nBlack people have a distinct, complex and vibrant history. This is true of all ethnic and religious groups. That being said, the history of Black Americans in this nation is vastly distinct from others given the religious, economic, social, psychological and educational experiences. By exploring Black History Month, the nation is paying homage to a group of people who are strong, resilient, creative, largely committed to religion, spiritual, innovative, largely forgiving, distinctive and have contributed greatly to the enhancement of America.\n\nIn a society where Black people are often routinely depicted as drains on and menaces to society, Black History Month often serves as a needed slice of factual history and opiate of sorts to counterbalance such routinely negative narratives.\n\n· While the situation has improved somewhat, the fact is that distinctive and notable accomplishments of Black Americans are often marginalized and, in some cases, dismissed from the public discourse.\n\n· Black History Month (especially in recent years) showcases the diversity and pluralism that has always been in ample supply in the Black community. Such diverse exposure demonstrates that the Black community is not a monolith but rather a great mosaic of talent.\n\n· The fact is that Black Americans are not the only group of people who intensely celebrate their history. Here are a few other periods of celebrations of which you may be aware: March (Women's History), April (Arab American Heritage), May (Asian American and Pacific Islander Heritage), June (LGBTQ Pride), September 15 to October 15 (Hispanic Heritage) and November (Native American Heritage).\n\nThe fact is that anyone, regardless of race, gender, sexuality, religion, etc., should not be hesitant to embrace their entire selves. Black History Month provides Black Americans (as well as others) with more than a source of pride and admiration. It also serves as a crucial reminder to reflect upon our leaders and triumphs of yesteryear, a history that has largely defined with blood, sweat, pain, setbacks, victories and tears.\n\nTo be sure, there are still many ills which afflict the Black community that must and are being aggressively confronted. Despite misguided naysayers such as Stacey Dash (she has indeed been \"clueless\" as of late) and others who argue for the abolition of Black History Month, the fact is that it is a celebration that should be acknowledged every day of the year. There is nothing wrong with pumping up the volume during one specific month!\n\nElwood Watson, Ph.D. is a professor of History, African American Studies and Gender Studies at East Tennessee State University.

      "text": "Ohio State Board of Education Member Defends White Supremacy\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nAs the board fought over implicit bias training, member Diana Fessler admitted what she fears will be lost.\n\nIn July 2020, amid nationwide protests against police brutality and for racial justice, the Ohio State Board of Education passed a resolution to address racial inequality in the state's education system. Black students statewide have, on average, significantly lower standardized test scores and graduation rates than other demographic groups, and Black male students are disproportionately disciplined, suspended, and expelled.\n\nThe resolution, introduced by board President Laura Kohler, acknowledges that \"Ohio's education system has not been immune\" to racism and inequality and that \"while we earnestly strive to correct them, we have a great deal of work left to do.\" It calls for the state education board to offer board members implicit bias training, programs designed to help people understand their own unconscious biases and the ways stereotypes can distort their beliefs; for all state Department of Education employees and contractors to take the training; for the department to reexamine curricula for racial bias; and for school districts to examine curricula and practices for hiring, staff development, and student discipline. For some members, these simple reforms were too extreme.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe measure passed by a margin of 12-5, with one member abstaining, and quickly sparked a fight over whether its provisions constituted \"critical race theory\" - the name of a legitimate sociological theory that is now being used by the right to conjure a vague, amorphous, and constantly shifting threat. With four new members elected in November 2020 and three new members appointed by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, the State Board of Education in July voted 14-4 to ask Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost to determine if the resolution was legal. In a September 14 opinion with an accompanying letter to the board, Yost wrote that the state could not require private contractors to take implicit bias training, criticizing the idea for imputing \"collective guilt.\"\n\nIn his letter, Yost included a graph from a Gallup poll showing the increase in approval rates for interracial marriages from 1959 to 2013 to illustrate \"the phenomenal distance America has traveled toward the ideals of its founding.\" Touting the progress of the civil rights movement, the Loving v. Virginia Supreme Court decision, and Martin Luther King Jr., he labeled the advocates for implicit bias training in Ohio schools part of \"the contra-King movement\" that \"sees our country's aspirational and founding documents - the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution - as instruments designed to establish and maintain white supremacy and racial oppression forever\" and \"wants to teach our children that their character is determined by the color of their skin.\"\n\nTwo weeks after Yost determined that the resolution was outside his authority, the Ohio House Government Oversight Committee held a hearing in which one education board member, Diana Fessler, openly defended white supremacy. Fessler criticized last year's resolution \"to condemn racism and to advance equity and opportunity for Black students, Indigenous students, and students of color\" during the September 28 meeting, claiming that the resolution \"has one sentence in it, and it is this: 'The State Board of Education condemns in the highest terms possible white supremacy culture.' Now I don't know how on Earth that could have got past our legal department, because to me it seems patently noncompliant with the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\" On Wednesday , the board will vote on a resolution by member Brendan Shea to rescind the measure.\n\n\"Can you in your wildest dreams imagine that we had adopted a resolution that said, 'The State Board of Education condemns in the highest terms possible Black culture?'\" Fessler continued. \"Oh, we'd have a war going on now, wouldn't we?\"\n\nState Board of Ed member Diana Fessler defended white supremacy today: \"[Board's equity resolution] condemns in the highest terms possible white supremacy culture. I don't know how that could have got past our legal department b/c to me it seems non compliant w/ Civil Rights Act\" pic.twitter.com/JawO6yQjOq\n\n- Plunderbund (@plunderbund) September 28, 2021\n\nFessler inaccurately referred to the resolution in question as a measure on critical race theory. The topic, which describes the study of the social construct of race and how society reinforces that construct - think gentrified neighborhoods or segregated school systems - has been the subject of much discussion and targeted disinformation by right-wing operatives in the wake of nationwide protests for racial justice in the summer of 2020.\n\nThe fuss over critical race theory, often abbreviated as CRT, partially explains Fessler's misidentification: Part of the organized effort to sensationalize the well-established sociological theory is to associate any effort to discuss or educate the public on institutional and systemic racism with a fictitious movement to propagandize public education with \"woke\" litmus tests. Nationwide, angry parents have descended on public school board meetings to protest efforts to include historical context on institutional racism in curricula, arguing that doing so amounts to brainwashing their children. In June, a Connecticut school board changed \"Columbus Day\" to \"Indigenous Peoples' Day\" on its school calendar in recognition of Christopher Columbus's atrocities - but was soon forced to reverse its decision. In August, the board changed the name back after outraged local residents claimed that the change was part of critical race theory.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney of Cleveland, ranking member of the Ohio House Government Oversight Committee, said Fessler's comments showed \"severe racial bias\" and \"extremism infecting the Ohio Legislature.\"\n\n\"There should be zero controversy over condemning white supremacy as a hateful culture of violence and division. Instead, Ms. Fessler's comments showcase not only severe racial bias but also the extremism infecting the Ohio Legislature. It is outrageous that an elected official who makes decisions about the education of our children would equate white supremacy with Black culture,\" Sweeney said in a statement to The Intercept. \"To say that condemning white supremacy violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964 shows a fundamental ignorance not only of that landmark legislation but also of the definition of white supremacy itself. It is the reason why such condemnations are necessary and warranted.\"\n\nFessler, who is a Republican, was first elected to the Ohio State Board of Education in 1994 and elected again in 1998. She was a state representative from 2001 to 2008. Last year, she ran unopposed and was reelected to the board. Fessler, board President Kohler, state school superintendent Stephanie Siddens, and House Government Oversight Committee Chair Shane Wilkin, a Republican, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren't on the beat?\n\nThe kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable. The Intercept is an independent nonprofit news outlet. We don't have ads, so we depend on our members to help us hold the powerful to account. Joining is simple and doesn't need to cost a lot: You can become a sustaining member for as little as $3 or $5 a month.

In Catholic theology most souls are of middling virtue - but the ones which are not are generally not good or evil alone but both at once. As St. Augustine put it, \"my two wills, one old and the other new, one carnal, the other spiritual, contend within me.\" The same goes for countries: If they're not in the middle of the bell curve they often occupy both ends simultaneously. That is definitely the United States.\n\nSecond, one of America's most beautiful attributes is that we have freedom and resources that our fellow malcontents in many other countries could only dream of. Pretending that we don't have this wiggle room is - particularly for white activists - to show ourselves to be distastefully spoiled.\n\nThird, being conscious of this country's upside is the only way we'll ever be able to communicate with anyone outside the minute lefty archipelago. The lived experience of millions of Americans has been that it's superior to where their families once came from. Trying to convince them that it's uniformly appalling is like trying to convince them that they have three arms. That's not going to work.\n\nFinally, it's critical for our own psychological wellbeing. Much about America's past has been hideous and much about the present is grim. But keeping that going as an endless interior monologue is a recipe for stasis and failure. Conversely, an appreciation of the glorious parts of the U.S. is motivation to protect and expand them. The right loves to accusingly demand, \"Do you love this country?\" We need the confidence to give the correct answer, which is \"I love the parts you're trying to destroy.\"\n\nSo for July 4, I've made a list of what's most deeply meaningful to me about America.\n\nJennifer Burbank of the Georgetown volunteer fire department, decorates a firetruck with a 48-star U.S. flag donated by longtime Georgetown resident Bernice Plass before the start of the Fourth of July Parade in downtown Georgetown on Friday July, 4, 2003.\n\nPeople Have Rights, Not the Government\n\nFor most of the time in most places, societies believed that the natural order was to have a king who had the final word about everything. The Declaration of Independence was one of the first attempts to flip that on its head, and declare that individual people come first and governments derive their power \"from the consent of the governed.\"\n\nIt's easy to forget the momentousness of this statement in an era when Fortune 500 companies complain that governmental tyranny prevents them from putting arsenic in their line of baby food. But it was a giant step forward, and one of the best parts about being an American is an instinctive understanding of the zaniness of monarchies. For instance, Great Britain pays an old lady from some German family to live in a gigantic house, and if you have dinner there you have to immediately stop eating when she does .\n\nThe Declaration of Independence resonated so deeply with universal human aspirations that it was copied by many other rebellions. Ho Chi Minh used parts of it verbatim in 1945 in a declaration of independence for Vietnam. We were so moved by this that the Eisenhower administration offered France two nuclear bombs to drop on Dien Bien Phu.\n\nSeparation of Church and State\n\nNot only did most places have kings in 1776, it was usually accepted that these kings had been appointed by god. This meant that you couldn't question the king's decisions even when large holes had been eaten in his brain by syphilis.\n\nSo establishing a wall between religion and government in the Bill of Rights was deeply radical and positive. The corporate right has long understood how this levels society, which is why they've quietly supported efforts to tear it down and retcon U.S. history to make the founding fathers fervent Christians.\n\nAnyone From Anywhere\n\nIn most places at most times, nationality has depended on blood and soil. For instance, Korean-Japanese whose families have been there for 100 years are still referred to as zainichi - which literally means \"staying in Japan,\" presumably temporarily. But in theory and to a large degree in fact, anyone can come to the U.S. from anywhere, and when they take the oath of citizenship they become as American as everyone else.\n\nThe Nazis used to call the U.S. a mongrel nation. They were absolutely right; it's fantastic and the source of our hybrid vigor.\n\nWe're So Rich\n\nThe U.S. right likes to tout our enormous wealth as a sign of our success. In reality, it signifies a humiliating failure of our economic system, even leaving aside our stunning levels of inequality.\n\nWe have advantages possessed by no other country in history. We're gigantic, in the temperate zone, overflowing with natural resources, and with neighbors so weak we generally forget that they're there. Yet Europe and Japan are about as rich as we are, despite having few of these assets and regularly destroying themselves in catastrophic wars. We should have twice as much money as they do.\n\nNevertheless, by any reasonable standard the U.S. is an incredibly wealthy place, as wealthy as any country needs to be to maximize human happiness. If we get our act together to fight, we could use our riches to do amazing things.\n\nFor instance, much of our gains in economic productivity over the past 40 years have gone into the pockets of millionaires and billionaires. The median household income in the U.S. now is about $56,500. If flight attendants and firemen had gotten their share of economic growth, they would be making over $70,000. Alternatively - and even more enticingly - if we'd had the power to take our increased productivity in time off regular people could be making their current salaries while only working about 30 hours per week.\n\nWho knows what we'd do with that kind of extra time for ourselves, but it's thrilling to contemplate. If current trends continued there would certainly be a lot of podcasts; once we're only working 15 hours a week and the ratio of podcasts to podcast listeners passes 1:1, we'll have to invent robots to rate and review them on iTunes.\n\nAfrican American and Secular Jewish Culture\n\nI'm not black and, despite the enthusiastic (((feedback))) I receive from the alt-right, I'm also not Jewish. I'm a baptized Episcopalian, a Mischling second degree , and a practicing nothing. But to me, looking at black culture and Jewish culture in America from the periphery, they seem to be humanity's two premiere achievements.\n\nI used to think that William Faulkner's claim that \"man will not merely endure: he will prevail\" was hokey and overoptimistic. But the history of African Americans is evidence he knew what he was talking about.\n\nTwo hundred fifty years of kidnapping, murder, rape and chattel slavery; \"freedom\" followed by 100 years of treatment that was slavery-adjacent; a 10-year window when change seemed possible; and then 40 years of mass incarceration that is intermittent reenslavement. It's incredible African Americans haven't collapsed in exhaustion, or simply perished.\n\nInstead, faced with a 1,000-foot high wall of hate, they've dug tunnels under it, floated over it waving from hot air balloons, and built transporters to dematerialize and then rematerialize on the other side, all to the bafflement and fury of much of white America. We understand violence and in fact rejoice when faced with it, because we know how to respond in kind a hundred times over. What we can't understand is black America's unending eruption of invention - in politics, music, literature, sports, Twitter, general stylishness, and a thousand other areas - that reverberates around the world. It's set a standard of wisdom and humanity for everyone else on earth to aim for.\n\nThe accomplishments of secular Jewish culture in America have been similar, although modulated differently.\n\nAll religions have the same essential precepts, and most religions ignore them in practice. Judaism stands out for sometimes taking them seriously. Both the Torah and Old Testament instruct us that \"Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.\" Only Judaism builds a holiday around this admonition, and sends participants out into the world believing that maybe those words mean what they say.\n\nLikewise, I can't help but love an ethical tradition that requires kids to ask questions . As Rabbi Jonathan Sacks has put it, \"To be a Jewish child is to learn how to question.\" I.I. Rabi, an American Nobel Prize-winning physicist, said he became a scientist because when he came home from school each day his mother would ask him not what he'd learned, but whether he'd asked a good question. Polls have shown that American Jews value \"thinking for oneself\" as the most critical quality to encourage in children.\n\nThe collision of this perspective with the openness of American culture has exploded in every direction. It's impossible to imagine how different, and how much worse, the U.S. would be without the influence of secular Judaism.\n\nThen there's what is, for me, the dazzling summit of African American and Jewish culture: the collaborative creation of American comedy.\n\nComedy of the powerful tends to take this structure: \"Wouldn't it be funny if...\" You can see this clearly in Monty Python, whose main five performers went to Oxford and Cambridge. Wouldn't it be funny if a pet store owner refused to acknowledge a parrot he'd just sold to a customer had died ? Wouldn't it be funny if the head of a mountaineering expedition had double vision ?\n\nBut the comedy of the powerless usually says something else: \"Isn't it funny that...\" The powerless don't need to invent surrealistically absurd situations, they live them. So a Chris Rock joke is: Isn't it funny that that train's never late ?\n\nAnd the comedy of reality will always be superior to the comedy of imagination, no matter how well executed. That's why American comedy, created by African Americans and Jews (with an assist from Irish Catholics) is the current reigning world champion.\n\nOf course, I understand that the individual humans involved in all this did not do so as a hobby or to make America better, but to survive in the face of monstrous cruelty. Billie Holiday would have traded \"Strange Fruit\" for an end to lynchings. Our goal should be to make this country so good that we end up with a bland, Swiss-like pudding of a culture.\n\nBaseball\n\nI can't honestly claim I like baseball that much. But all lists like this by liberals seem to include it, so I feel peer pressure to do so too. You're also supposed to be super into jazz.\n\nSo that's why I love America. I encourage you to think about it yourself today in between the cookout, beach, and fireworks. Writing it down made me feel much better about being alive right here right now, and it could do the same for you.\n\nTop photo: A Liberty Bell float looms high over spectators in the 2015 Fourth of July Parade in Pittsfield, Mass. on Saturday, July 4, 2015.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "The Radical Imagination of Eve Ewing\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe \"Electric Arches\" author talks about being a public school science teacher, the white CIA operative in \"Black Panther,\" guns, Chicago and much more.\n\nEvery week on Intercepted, we examine various threads of power and their impact on our society and on everyday people's lives. We speak to journalists, lawmakers, lawyers, and activists about war, about guns, about racism, and political hypocrisy. But we also have made a commitment to feature the work and voices of artists and musicians and poets and writers. These folks play a unique role in our society, particularly at moments like the one we currently live in.\n\nOne such artist is Dr. Eve Ewing. She's actually much more than just an artist. She's a sociologist of education and a writer from Chicago. Her research has focused on racism, social inequality, urban policy, and the impact of these forces on American public schools and the lives of young people.\n\nShe has a new book out called, \"Electric Arches,\" which explores these issues by blending stark realism with the surreal and fantastic.  It's a beautiful collection of Eve's poetry, essays, and visual art.\n\nEve Ewing's latest book, \"Electric Arches.\" Illustration: Brianna McCarthy\n\nEve Ewing's latest book, \"Electric Arches.\"\n\nIllustration: Brianna McCarthy\n\nOn last week's episode, we aired an excerpt of our interview with Ewing. That audio is linked below. What follows is a transcript of our entire conversation with Ewing, where we discuss her book and art, her time as a science teacher in a public school, the white CIA operative in the Black Panther film, guns, how certain people use violence in Chicago to serve their political agendas, and much more.\n\nJeremy Scahill: Eve Ewing, welcome to Intercepted.\n\nEve Ewing: Thanks for having me.\n\nJS: Before we get into this new book \"Electric Arches,\" I want to first ask you: Because Donald Trump and his allies bring up Chicago so much and they make it sound, you know, that Chicago is the epicenter of this frightening violence in America, just your general response to the way that Chicago is talked about in this moment in time by a specific group of people in this country.\n\nEE: Yeah, I wrote an essay about this. But basically the way I feel about it is that it's very convenient to use Chicago as a symbol that is really for many people kind of like an effective dog-whistle. It frightens people. It's used in the service of the same kind of rhetoric that we heard in past presidential administrations with things like, \"welfare queens\" and \"crack babies.\" Right? These are these are racialized images that are meant to inspire fear and loathing in the hearts of Americans and to make them feel as though there's justification for any kind of extreme crackdown, right, that might happen afterwards.\n\nIt has nothing to do with an actual desire to help or care for uplift or support or nurture or even listen to people who actually live here, because if it did stem from that genuine desire, there would be so many different kinds of interventions like providing us with more social services and resources, helping us hold our elected officials accountable for our educational system, responding to the Department of Justice and their inquiry into the fact that the Chicago Police Department has longstanding - generations-long - systemic racism.\n\nThose are the things that would actually help Chicago, and Chicagoans will be quick to tell you that, but it's really not about us, it's really about using this symbol as a scary, violent, black place that is supposed to inspire fear in the hearts of Americans and unfortunately it works pretty well.\n\nJS: Right, and with this whole discussion now about guns in the United States and the school shootings and now so many young people walking out, confronting politicians and political figures, the refrain from the right and from Trump is always, \"Well, if you care about guns, why aren't you doing anything about Chicago?\" And the reality is that the overwhelming majority of the gun-related problems in this country are not coming out of Chicago. The problem is that we have a gun culture where people are addicted, and they're largely white males, to stockpiling very high-powered weapons.\n\nEE: Yeah, and the thing is that, you know, people here do fight violence every single day. There are so many community organizers and leaders and educators that not only stand against gun violence, not only actually show up to the vigils of the young people that are lost in our communities all the time, but are attuned to the deeper issues and reasons and committed to the city and are committed to actually unpacking the reasons behind this violence.\n\nAgain this is - you're exactly right. This is, it's really rhetoric, it's using the city as a stand-in for fear and it's really, quite frankly, very insulting to tell people, you know, why don't you do anything about the violence in Chicago, when folks have no desire to learn about or uplift the people who do that work, that is really quite thankless work every single day.\n\nAnd I am really, really grateful and moved and excited by the younger folks that are stepping up and speaking out against gun violence. And what I really, really hope, and I think that I have reason to believe that this hope is going to come to fruition, what I really hope is that they can form meaningful coalitions and solidarity between students who are from wealthier, whiter communities saying that, \"We don't want this to happen in our community again\" and young people from places like Baltimore, places like Chicago places where this violence is an everyday reality. Those young people want the same things they want to show up and be safe at school, they want jobs they want to see a future for themselves and I'm really excited by the possibility of that solidarity.\n\nAt the time we're having this conversation, this week we saw the National School Walkout. And I shared a video on Twitter of a young woman, [a] 16-year-old black girl who was participating in the exact same kinds of walkouts that we saw these inspiring photos of all over the country, and she is arrested. And she's peacefully protesting and is arrested. And she is not facing any charges, but that's a trauma that she's going to have to live with for the rest of her life. And so I just want to invite people across the country to understand that even as we see young people speaking up and speaking out, the consequences for those young people are still widely divergent based on things like race and class. And it's our job as adults to support them and also help them see these points of solidarity and be hyper-aware of those young people for whom speaking up and exercising their right to free speech really puts them at risk, and those are undocumented students, students of color, students with disabilities, trans students, the same kids that are facing risk and vulnerability every single day just for being who they are. We have to protect them and make sure that they have a chance to exercise their free speech rights as well.\n\nJS: And you wrote this great essay for [The] Fader that was called \"Black Life And Death In A Familiar America.\"\n\nEE: Oh, thank you for reading that. It's very depressing.\n\nJS: Well yes, but we always say on this show that history and context matter, and I think the nuance that you're writing with is really refreshing and really essential. I just want to share with people part of that.\n\nYou were writing about Mount Greenwood, which is a neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago that is different from what you might imagine the way that the South Side of Chicago is talked about. And you write: \"Mt. Greenwood residents became excited at the mere mention of his name, and for a moment the altercation had the tone of a spontaneous campaign rally. They began to chant 'Donald Trump,' and one of them directly addressed the young black woman holding the camera, 'Build that wall! We'll fuckin' put you on the other side, motherfucker!' I watched him through a screen, through another screen, through the eyes of another. I closed my eyes and imagined what it would be like to look at him through a chain-link fence.\"\n\nWas this an event that signaled to you that Donald Trump's vision for America was sort of alive and well even in patches of this part of the country in Chicago that's talked about so much before he was even elected?\n\nEE: Yeah, absolutely. Thank you. That was a beautiful reading. I really appreciate it.\n\nYeah, so that piece was published the day after the election, and the event that I'm describing there took place before the election. And so I think that timing is important to illustrate exactly what you're saying, which is that during the Trump campaign and then right after he was elected, there was a lot of justifiable and understandable fear, hand-wringing, and shock, especially from corners of liberal, white America where people thought, basically, this was a referendum that made them realize that the America that they thought they lived in does not exist. Or this election constituted a transformational, historical event that somehow gave permission or highlighted new forms of racism or new forms of xenophobia.\n\nIn no way do I want to undercut what I do think have been some of the uniquely awful aspects of this administration, but I also think it's important for folks to remember that this is not like the man in a laboratory conjuring up these racist people like Frankensteins, who had never existed - you know, Frankenstein monsters that never existed. Rather it is him giving a voice and a platform for an energy behind white supremacy and hatred that has a long history in America and that actually, in my opinion, constitutes the very fabric of the nation.\n\nAnd so I think that that's important to realize, because it makes you understand that in order to conquer or change or transform the kind of hatred and vile evil that we're seeing right now, it's not just about these particular voters, it's not just about this particular election, but we have to be brave enough to confront and understand a history that is much deeper and an aspect of this culture that runs very, very deep.\n\nAnd basically, like, the America that people feared was going to come into fruition or come to reality already existed before the election. And these folks were more than happy to use this president as a sort of projection of the energy that they already had and the opinions that they already had.\n\nJS: Now, unlike Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, you've actually spent quite a bit of time in public schools.\n\nEE: (Laughs.) Yes, yes I have.\n\nJS: And taught public schools. And her proposal, and it's not just hers, but now she's sort of in charge of it, this idea of arming teachers.\n\nEE: Mhmm. To fight the bears that are gonna -\n\nJS: Well, although, maybe, I've still been trying to find out if grizzly bears are a euphemism for a group of people and we just aren't hip to it. But just in general, your thoughts about that, and what it sort of indicates about the moment we're in?\n\nEE: Yeah, so, there's so much. There are so many things wrong with this idea that it's really hard to even wrap your mind around where to begin.\n\nYou know, when I was a public school teacher, I spent an average of $100 a week on supplies for my own students, especially because when I started out I was teaching science and I was the only science teacher for the entire middle school, so I had about 170 students that I taught science to every week, 6th, 7th, and 8th graders.\n\nJS: Wow.\n\nEE: And I was committed to - yeah, just me - I mean, you know, they got subjects from other people, but I was the only person teaching science to 170 kids. And I was committed to providing them the best inquiry-based science education that I possibly could, which meant I didn't just want them to read about things in textbooks, I wanted them to do all the things that so many of us remember as being the fun things that allow you to see how science actually works and bring it to life. I wanted them to connect circuits. I wanted them to look at things under microscopes. Right? And all those things cost money.\n\nAnd so I would spend massive amounts of money every week. I would make my lesson plans on Sunday and then on Monday I would go to Home Depot and I would go to Radio Shack and I would go to the pet store to get the food to feed our class pets and animals we had in the classroom, and all those things came out of my pocket. And I never heard you know the secretary of education or any of these people out here outraged and wanting to arm me with the actual things that I needed to do my job every week.\n\nAt the end of the year, I was entitled to a $100 reimbursement, and I would just pick whatever random receipts I had from that week and use it to file for my union-entitled $100 reimbursement.\n\nAnd so, to hear these same folks in the name of protecting students or protecting lives talking about how we should arm teachers, many teachers have risen up and said: \"Arm us with pencils, arm us with nurses, right? Arm us with social workers.\" We had a social worker to serve our entire school who is serving multiple schools and she would come once a week, right? And try to give service to whoever she could in that limited time.\n\nThese are very common - counselors, people to just help with basic disabilities with all kinds of things that we actually need in terms of resources, and once again, it betrays that none of this is actually about helping anybody but it's about reinforcing an agenda of control and militarization.\n\nAnd the other thing, you know, lots of teachers have said this kind of rhetoric of like, \"Arm us with the things we actually need.\" Which I agree with, and I also want to add to that when people sign up to be teachers, they want to be educators. They sign up to transform lives to nurture young people, to support people that are in need, to help shape their minds, to help them discover the things about themselves that are wonderful and special and their gifts and their talents and interests. That's why I wanted to be a teacher. I didn't want to be a teacher so that I would be a frontline soldier. And I don't think that that the teachers of America should have to worry about volunteering their lives or making the decisions between going home to their families that day and sacrificing themselves for the children in their classroom. And I don't think that that is something to be ashamed of. To say, \"I didn't sign up for this job to potentially die.\" You know, and to be a soldier. I think that is perfectly reasonable.\n\nWhen I was a teacher, I spent plenty of time sort of envisioning in my head my own sort of plan if there ever was an active shooter in the building, you know, looking at the students before me and thinking, \"OK, which one could I count on to run over and grab my keys,\" or if I say, \"Everybody needs to get under the desk,\" who's the one who always is going to say, \"Why do we have to do that, Miss Ewing?'\" Basically trying to make these plans in my head that accounted for the actual kids in front of me that I knew and that I loved. And that's just really messed up. That's brain space that I shouldn't have had to dedicate to thinking about how I would protect the kids in my care, and hopefully escape with my life. And to validate that and further uplift it by talking about giving teachers guns is just morally reprehensible to me.\n\nJS: Well, and we've also seen in this era of social media, you were mentioning Twitter before, videos that young people are posting of staff inside of schools assaulting students, and this is not even having a gun.\n\nEE: Absolutely\n\nJS: I mean my real fear about guns in school is that these altercations where we've seen, you know, staff at schools slamming black children down or putting them in a headlock or restraining them by extreme force or doing other things that may not be physical assault but are meant to humiliate them in retribution, in revenge for some perceived slight - that now you're going to have some of these hotheads in schools, not necessarily teachers but other staffers who have guns? And what are those altercations going to look like now if those staffers have guns on them?\n\nEE: I think you're absolutely right. And we also already have police and these SROs, these security resource officers, in schools, and there are many, many students in this country that attend schools that have security or police presence and no counselors to help them get to college. That is despicable.\n\nAnd I think you're right. You know, I think about the black children murdered across this country, who will never make it to high school because someone thought they were dangerous. I think about Tamir Rice, I think about Aiyana Stanley, and the idea that we would further introduce that dynamic into schools, a place where children are supposed to feel safe and where many of them already do not, it's just bad policy.\n\nJS: Now you've mentioned being a science teacher. I have to say one of my most favorite pieces in your new book, \"Electric Arches\" is the piece called \"The Device.\"\n\nEE: Oh, thank you.\n\nJS: I think it's really interesting. I think for a lot of young black kids who are interested in coding and tech, I think this is going to be a really inspirational story for them.\n\nEE: Oh, thank you.\n\nThis is the first paragraph of the short story, \"The Device:\"\n\n\"It wasn't like a George Washington Carver kind of thing, where one brilliant Negro with a soldering iron made some magic and poof! A miraculous machine. It was an open-source kind of situation. Thousands of high school science-fair whiz kids, this and that engineering club at this and that technical college, the One Black Person at a bunch of Silicon Valley startups getting together with a bunch of other One Black Persons over craft beer and coding late into the night, even some government folks working off the clock (or so the rumors go). Not just one person. A hive mind of black nerds, obsessive types, scientists, and inventors but also historians and archaeologists and the odd astrologer here and there. Project Delta Mother, they called it (goofy name TBH but it's whatever).\"\n\nSo that's the beginning of this short story, \"The Device.\" And the story is about, as is described in that first paragraph, a collective group of black scientists across the country who build this machine and the purpose of the machine is to allow you to communicate with your ancestors.\n\nAnd the story describes the first time that the machine is turned on, and the little girl who is selected to be like the test pilot flips the switch and finds herself communicating with her ancestors over space and time. And it doesn't go exactly as everybody thinks it's going to go.\n\nAnd I wrote that story, I was invited to give a reading at the Art Institute of Chicago in the African art gallery. And so I was - so I had some time to tour the gallery by myself and check it out. And this doesn't end the way it ends in \"Black Panther,\" where then I like, executed a careful heist of the artifacts. That did not happen. What happened was, I was looking at a mask, and there was a series of West African masks that were supposed to enable the wearer to basically channel the spirits of their ancestors and so they were used in different rituals and events where somebody would wear them and then they would embody the spirits of the people that had gone before them. And I thought about what a powerful idea that was for African-Americans, for those of us for whom our lineage is necessarily cut off by chattel slavery.\n\nI have a tattoo on my right shoulder blade of my matrilineal genealogy, and it goes back to my mom, my grandma, my great-grandma, back to my great, great grandmother who died a free person but was born an enslaved person. And because she's considered property and record-keeping is spotty, I don't have any access to the people who came before her.\n\nAnd I thought a lot - this is something that African-Americans specifically wrestle with a lot in this country, especially as we consider our place in the diaspora and sometimes get messages from other people in the diaspora that, you know, we don't have a real history or that slavery is something we should be ashamed of and it doesn't give us access to kind of a national identity or an understanding of who our ancestors were.\n\nAnd so I wanted to grapple with that idea and think about, you know, what if we could use science to talk to them. And then I thought like, \"Do we really want to talk to our ancestors?\" Like, our ancestors are family and do you always want to talk to your family, and sometimes family is annoying, or they bother you about things or they hassle you, or they don't get certain aspects of who you are. And I tried to think about what it actually means to not just consider our ancestors as these like mythical, magical people, but as human beings with their own opinions and thoughts and unexpected quirks. So that's kind of where the story came from.\n\nJS: Yeah, it's a great story.\n\nEE: Thank you.\n\nJS: And I encourage people to read it. I think it's so important, I mean young people in general, I think need to, I mean obviously it's great if they can be more excited about science because science is one of the ways that we counteract the kind of culture that now exists in Washington and with the current administration. You mentioned, you mentioned Black Panther there, and I, therefore, have to ask or point out that your current Twitter name is Wikipedia \"Killmonger, But Make It Feminist\" brown.\n\nEE: Yes.\n\nJS: What did you make of the white CIA guy who is helping Wakanda?\n\nEE: Yeah. That's so deep. I could go on about this for a long time. But, I think that Ryan Coogler situated the movie so - I mean these questions about diaspora are so - that is to me, is like the center of the movie. And I mean, if you haven't seen a movie at this point, it's on you. So all the spoiler alerts, obviously.\n\nBut, you know, I went to the movie expecting like a great action movie, and what I got is this movie that presents these actual serious ethical dilemmas about our like Pan-African identity and blackness and what kinds of responsibilities we have to each other in history, and you know the whole time I was sitting in the movie with my partner, and he kept like, every time Killmonger made like a speech, he would just lean over and say, \"He's not wrong, he's got a point.\" Right?\n\nAnd of course, upon further analysis we think about the fact that his, you know, basically what he wants to do is recreate empire and recreate white supremacy, right? Hence my hence my Twitter name \"Killmonger, But Make It Feminist.\" Right? Make it about restoration and reparation and not about recreating empire and harm and colonialism.\n\nSo anyway, to get your actual question, I think that you know Coogler, coming from Oakland understands so much about the work that intelligence government, intelligence agencies did and have done and continue to do into the present I might add, to try to undermine black freedom movements.\n\nAnd so it's really deep that T'Challa trusts the CIA guy, and I think it says something about him that's really interesting and worth investigating, the fact that, he sees himself as having a solidarity with him in a need to save his life based on the individual interactions that they've had, that might be very different from how an African-American person would view him as a symbol of an evil institution or maybe he's just being pragmatic. I don't know. But he really let that man in to see like all their technology and everything. I was like, \"No! What are you doing?\" So, yeah.\n\nJS: One of the thoughts I had, and I have to say I know Ryan Coogler personally, and I met him when he was working on his first film \"Fruitvale Station\" and I was working on a documentary at the time, we were mixing sound for our films at the same time, and then he and I were kind of on the circuit together, and now he's blown up. He did \"Creed.\"\n\nEE: Yeah.\n\nJS: Which is, probably, I think the best Rocky movie, if not the best, the best since the original. But, I mean, that was an amazing film.\n\nEE: It's so good.\n\nJS: And, Black Panther, I'm going to go and see it again, because I am very interested in that CIA character.\n\nHere's my theory, Eve. I think that it's possible that they're introducing him, and that T'Challa and others in Wakanda think, \"Well, yeah, we know who he is, but he seems to be like with us on this particular thing.\" And I'm hoping that it's a metaphor for how the CIA has always functioned in colonial territories, where they say, \"Oh, we're here to help you,\" or \"We'll help you on this thing,\" and then later you realize who they really are and that we see like an uprising of Wakanda against the CIA. That's my hope.\n\nEE: Well and that's one of the things where, you know, one of the masterful narrative arcs of the movie is that in the beginning we see Sterling K. Brown's character, we see them, it seems like they're planning some sort of heist or robbery or something like that. And what we come to understand is that actually, he has gone to the United States and learned about black freedom movements from African-American people and learned about this diasporic history and so his perspective is one of black solidarity across kind of nationhood, and he sees himself as having responsibilities for folks.\n\nT'Challa doesn't, he doesn't feel that way. And, you know, so we expect him to have sort of a pan-Africanist lens that there's no reason why he would actually have having grown up in Wakanda, and so his obligations are individualized, right? And it's one way in which the loss of his uncle means the loss of another kind of wisdom that he could have really benefited from.\n\nAnd, you know, the funny part is that like his sort of compromise of his radical ideology is that he's going to go like participate in the nonprofit industrial complex in Oakland, and start, you know, basically be a housing owner and start some sort of after-school program. And people on Twitter are joking he's going to start a charter school.\n\nJS: (Laughs.)\n\nEE: And partner with like, P. Diddy and Common to run a charter school in Oakland. And I think that these are real critiques. Right? These are real critiques about the way some black people see participation and essentially like black capitalism as a pathway to freedom which is very different than what Killmonger had in mind before he gave his incredibly corny last words. (Laughs.)\n\nJS: Well, we're going to, you can be our movie critic from now on.\n\nEE: Yeah. Anytime, anytime.\n\nJS: So going to back to the book, one thing I also want people to be aware of, this is not simply a book of poetry or a collection of poetry and short stories. You also have visual art that you have created. Can you talk about how that's deployed throughout the book and how you make your visual art because it's interesting the trade that you use?\n\nEE: Thank you. Yeah, well, you know one book that really inspired \"Electric Arches\" was \"Citizen\" by Claudia Rankine. And I was amazed at the idea of incorporating visual art as, in service of perpetuating some of the ideas and thoughts that are central to the book and themes that are central to the book, but also, to be quite honest, as a way of just forcing people to have encounters with visual art.\n\nI find that, you know, poetry already as an art form is something that people have a lot of like sort of mystified mythos about, where many people think of it as very inaccessible or very hard to understand or they think that they need some kind of special training to understand it - like a class - it's confusing and so on. And I find that visual art often has the same reputation, especially contemporary art where people, you know they say things like, \"Well, I don't really know anything about art, or I don't get art, or I don't like modern art.\" Right? And often misusing the term modern for contemporary.\n\nAnd so part of what I want to do is invite people to have encounters with visual works as part of their encounter with text, and also basically to think of - I always think of the book as an object itself, and I want it to be in engaging object, and so that's why, for example, there are pages that are white text on a black background, rather than the other way around, and the cover is extremely engaging and the book is square. These are all things that make me - that I, that I did or that I wanted to do to kind of invite people to engage the book as an object as a physical thing and not only as something that lives in your head. And so that's why the visual art is there.\n\nI just did it because I could and I wanted to. That's the other reason. I had this amazing press that kind of let me do whatever I wanted, so I was like, \"Well, I want to put art in there.\" So I did.\n\nJS: Well, and one of your inventions is the decoder rings that used to come in cereal boxes.\n\nEE: Yeah!\n\nJS: And the one you've cooked up in your imagination allows the wearer to be able to understand what black girls are saying.\n\nEE: Yes, yes.\n\nJS: You could make that, you could probably make that and I bet it would catch on across this country.\n\nEE: Oh, what I could do is I could make it and then sell it on Etsy and then one of the Kardashians would copy it without my permission and then sell it for like thousands and thousands of dollars. And then, that would be like the natural life cycle of my invention. (Laughs.)\n\nJS: That's never happened to black creators in this country.\n\nEE: Yeah, right. Exactly.\n\nJS: There's no stealing of work.\n\nEE: (Laughs.) Yeah, I made that, sort of like childhood and playfulness are recurring themes in the book, and in my own life, and so, it's really: The black girl decoder ring is kind of playing with the fact that so much of popular culture is based on this sort of two-faced desire of black women, where on the one hand there's like a desire to imitate and to copy and to steal, you know beauty and body styles and hairstyles and things like that, but that's also coupled with a disrespect and like invisibility and even disgust with or like, sense of contempt for like actual black women and black women's bodies. And so the decoder ring is sort of like the thing that Taylor Swift or Katy Perry gets to wear, that will allow them the thing they most desire which is to be able to understand and fully access what black women are doing and saying without actually engaging with them as human beings. And I thought about that kind of translational work and the idea of like this cereal box toy that you could get.\n\nJS: If we had sound effects, I would be hitting like a boom sound effect. #takethattaylor. Another thing that I really find fun about your book is that you take well-known figures and then you place them in kind of different magical situations.\n\nEE: Yeah.\n\nJS: One of those is the blues legend Koko Taylor, and then a very famous person, the king, LeBron James.\n\nEE: The king himself.\n\nJS: Right, and I mean I want you to tell the story, but I mean the essence of it is LeBron James is sort of going through time and then he runs into or seeks out his teenage self. You'll do the job of describing it better than I would, but talk about that, and if you want to share part of it, that's cool, but if not, you can just talk about it. Either way, it's up to you.\n\nEE: Yeah, so I'll read this poem, it's called \"Note from LeBron James to LeBron James\":\n\n\"I knew it was you when I saw you in the parking lot, headphones on, waiting for Drew to come up with the car and trying not to eat all the chips before he got there. The tip of each finger of each hand finding its own minute ridged seam on the waistband of your shorts.\n\nI knew it was you from the way you smiled when you saw how lean my shoulders, how spare my triceps. I knew it was you because you haven't yet seen what will come after, the days when I was a ballast for every vessel I blinked at, an impossible man, when I was not the leg-lift or the quickstep or the hoist, I was the tire, the hurdle, the rope itself - I was the trial itself, and you can't know that yet.\n\nLeaning against nothing there in the sunlight, me kicking at sticky black pebbles sprung loose from the tar while you stood firm in your new shoes a few inches up on the curb where the melting street couldn't sully them, and both of us wanting lunch and touching our hips absentmindedly and listening to a jet pass overhead, the hum of a Saturday, and looking down the road toward where Portage Path would be, except too far past the oaks to see and us not really thinking about that anyway. I couldn't tell you.\n\nWhen it's time to roll you have to keep everybody tethered to you, no matter how heavy or hungry or ugly they get, you have to keep their soreness and their worst parts and their smashed tin wants and their construction paper crowns and their everything they ever wanted for you and for them in the same backpack with the shredded bottom where you keep your own drawings and scraped knuckles and your being afraid. Keep them like a secret. I couldn't tell you that just then.\"\n\nEE: So that poem - I'm putting my glasses back on - so that poem is, you know, LeBron James, like many people I have - OK. Something I find interesting about sports, growing up in like a fierce sports city like Chicago, is that sports are really about our collective societal desires. Right? They're about us projecting our hopes and our dreams and our desire to win and be victorious on to these like gladiators who are these incredible human beings.\n\nYou know, LeBron James, as a person, his very physiology is miraculous. Right? Like how can somebody be so big and so strong and also so fast and leap in the air and spin around and do things that like a figure skater would do? But also be so incredibly strong.\n\nAnd when I was a kid, you know the United Center in Chicago, now they've moved it inside, but my entire childhood there was this big famous iconic statue of Michael Jordan, and it's him leaping into the air and has this quote from the novel \"A River Runs Through It\" by Norman Maclean. And then it has, the inscription on the statue says: \"The best there ever was, the best there ever will be.\" Which is like such an amazing, I've always loved that phrase because there's such a hubris to it, right? It's like you have no way of possibly knowing that this is the greatest basketball player that will ever live, but you're speaking it. Right? Like this is like a prophecy. \"The best there ever was, the best there ever will be.\"\n\nAnd so that's like a big part of what I love about basketball - sports in general, but like that's my choice. I think also a lot of people see that same kind of heroism in football. But for me, growing up in Chicago in the '90s, right, basketball is everything.\n\nAnd so - but these are human beings. And I'm interested in, you know, with basketball there's these mythologies, the \"Hoop Dreams\" mythology of the kid on the street who basically achieves the American dream, where, you know he comes from poverty and just works really hard and has this incredible God-given skill and is able to rise up and be successful and buy his mother a house. And, you know, rapping kind of offers the same kind of American dream mythology, like hip-hop culture.\n\nBut the thing is that, you know, I'm also a sociologist and there's some interesting research that shows that NBA players are, for the most part, they come from families that have higher median incomes than most black people in the United States, and so the majority of NBA players are more like Steph Curry than LeBron James. Right? They are more people that, they come from families that have the money and the resources to get them to practice on time, get their uniforms ready, make sure that they are where they're supposed to be, have flexible jobs that allow them to support these things, and help them be on traveling teams, have the academic opportunities that enable that they're going to be able to play.\n\nAnd so it turns out that even though we have this mythology about basketball as this like the American dream, bootstrap space, in actuality it's just another part of America where your class background actually matters a lot for your outcomes.\n\nAnd, so because of all that, people like LeBron James who actually come from poverty are really remarkable to me in basketball, and so I started reading about his biography and his childhood, and basically the fact that at a very young age his outcomes for his, like his own life, but also the life of his family and his loved ones seem to sit very squarely on his shoulders, and his family's entire life, his mother basically uprooted their family and moved them into somebodies house so that he would be able to have consistent coaching and training. And she had him when she was a teenager.\n\nAnd also as a person who's also from a post-industrial Midwestern city, I have a lot of solidarity and love for Cleveland, and when LeBron James, when he did \"The Decision\" and when he announced that he was leaving Cleveland and he was going to go to Miami, I had this big giant poster of him in my classroom, I was teaching middle school, and I had this huge poster of LeBron James, and I ripped it off the wall. (Laughs.)\n\nJS: Wow!\n\nEE: Because I felt so betrayed that he was leaving the Midwest, and my students came in and were like, \"Miss E, where's LeBron?\" I was like, \"Shh, shh, shh. We're not talking about it - we don't speak his name in here, children.\" You know?\n\nAnd so, when he wrote this heartfelt essay - or you know if you co-wrote it with somebody, I don't know - but he wrote this heartfelt essay talking about how he was going to come back to Cleveland and about how part of it was because he wanted kids growing up in northeast Ohio to basically believe that it was possible to stay home and be right where you're from, right where you were born and like, be great, and accomplish great things for yourself and your family and your community, that meant so much to me.\n\nAnd so I wrote this time-traveling poem for him to kind of encounter his younger, his younger self.\n\nJS: Has he seen it?\n\nEE: To my knowledge, he has not seen it. I have one, as far as I know, I have exactly one NBA fan, who is Andre Iguodala, my fellow Chicagoan, and has been extremely supportive of the book, and has posted it on Instagram and stuff him.\n\nJS: Come on, Craig Hodges is at your same publisher.\n\nEE: I know, I know.\n\nJS: Haymarket, get on that!\n\nEE: I know, he's in the Haymarket gang with. I know, somebody, but as far as I know, the real-live people in the book, as far as I know, none of them have read any of the poems. It's Marilyn Mosby, Erykah Badu, LeBron James, Koko Taylor passed away, I did get a chance to meet her before she passed, which was amazing.\n\nJS: Oh nice. Metta World Peace?\n\nEE: Metta World Peace, no, and Stacey Dash, no. I don't think any of them have read any of these poems and I don't know what they would think about them.\n\nJS: Maybe LeBron James is a closet listener to this podcast.\n\nEE: Maybe!\n\nJS: He wants to be an expert on CIA drone strikes.\n\nEE: (Laughs.) You know for years, I grind my teeth and so I wear a mouthpiece when I go to sleep.\n\nJS: Don't wear it when Michael B. Jordan takes off his shirt.\n\nEE: (Laughs.) I know, right? Hopefully, that does not happen to me. But I wear a mouthpiece when I go to sleep because I grind my teeth and clench my jaw, and because I wear before I go to bed I have these - I sort of associate it with like peace and calm and like serenity and sleeping. And so for years, I wanted to write a poem about my mouthpiece. And Blake Griffin wrote one as a joke for a commercial, he wrote like a fake, like a poem, like an ode to his mouthpiece and I'm really angry that Blake Griffin beat me to the mouthpiece poem. So that's my only like, NBA poetry beef is that I'm salt about that. But if he ever wanted to collaborate on a poem, I would also be fine with that as well.\n\nJS: Fair enough. Before we, you and I, started talking today I was asking my colleagues, the producers of the show, what they thought of the book. And one of my colleagues, her favorite poem in the book was \"Appletree\" which, you mentioned, Erykah Badu, \"[on black womanhood, from and to Erykah Badu].\" So maybe you can you can lay that out for people and explain that piece.\n\nEE: So I'm going to read the first of seven section of this poem, called \"Appletree [on black womanhood, from and to Erykah Badu]\"\n\n\"First: The year Baduism came out was the same year I had sex ed for the first time. Not the kind with feelings or warnings or photographs, it was the vocabulary kind of sex ed. The kind with diagrams and purple inked diddle lines. And I was bad at remembering which words went with which shapes on the page and so at school I learned that my body was a worksheet, full of blank spaces and mysterious menacing forms and the best I could hope was that someone more knowledgeable than I was would know what to do with them.\n\nWhen I came home every day my mother would be playing the CD on repeat. You would begin and begin again. Oh, what a day. And I would sigh along with you and it was the first time I understood that the violet waxy blobs of my insides were circles spun with a lazy finger.\n\nThere's a small sun in there, you said, a cup of tea. There's a stone that moves of its own volition tracing a path each day from my throat to the soles of my feet and back up across the muscles of my thighs over my spine. It's a boulder without a Sisyphus. I learned that everything about me could be round and full if I let it, that under my skin were ciphers of humming and laughing and buzzing, stones laid in a labyrinth that turns and turns in on itself, so when you get to the center you have no choice but to turn around and walk the other way. What a day. What a day.\"\n\nEE: So, yeah, the poem is kind of like, an ode to Erykah Badu, or a tribute to her. You know, the book overall, is like coming of age in black girlhood and black womanhood, with the obvious understanding that those things are not monoliths. Right? And so this is like my particular story and my particular life and I hope that some people find things that are true in it, and other things maybe not so much.\n\nBut Erykah Badu, you know, was a very important figure in popular culture who kind of helped me understand a different version of black womanhood and what it means to be a black woman than I saw in other aspects of popular culture, in the media. And obviously this is changing to a degree and I think improving a lot, and its been amazing to see in the last couple of years, but for a lot of us growing up, for my mothers' generation, there were just very, very few black women in media. I mean, that's why seeing Nichelle Nichols in \"Star Trek\" was so important for so many young women, right? They were like, it's a black woman on a spaceship, that's amazing. You know, or seeing news anchors or things like that.\n\nBut for my generation, you know, there were black women, but there were just these very limited ideas of, you know, what it looked like to be a black woman, what kind of person you were allowed to be, and it just felt very limiting and very flat and two-dimensional. And Erykah Badu is just this really sort of strange, ethereal, otherworldly, wise character who came on the scene and just celebrated a different vision of what it meant to be a black woman than I had seen growing up.\n\nAnd her playfulness, her kind of irreverence, the fact that she could sing in the same way that the music that my parents or grandparents listened to, she had that kind of vocal ability, but hearing the song, \"Tyrone,\" right? Hearing a woman sing with this beautiful, incredible voice about like, throwing a dude out because he never pays for anything, and like, he has to come pick up all his stuff from your house, right? These are just like these true stories about life that also seem to, for me, restore some sense of agency or autonomy to the body, and that it's OK to have a body and your body is your body.\n\nAnd so, that was really important to me, and so I wanted to write that kind of love letter to her, and to what her work has accomplished, even though a lot of the things that she says now, I'm like, \"I really wish you wouldn't say that, Erykah.\" We don't know each other, so she doesn't contact me and ask me what she should say in these interviews, and if she did, I might give some different advice, but her work is just incredibly important to me and really means a lot to me.\n\nJS: Wow. Well, as we wrap up our conversation, I want to encourage everybody to pick up this book by Eve Ewing, which is called \"Electric Arches.\" And Eve has generously offered to share some unpublished poetry with us today, and I'm going to hand the reins over to her to do a short reading here, on Intercepted.\n\nEE: Well thank you again, so much, for having me. It's been delightful.\n\nSo, I'm going to read a poem from a new project that I have coming out in 2019. And the project, it's also coming out with Haymarket, it's called \"1919,\" and it's about the race riots that happened in Chicago in 1919, which obviously we'll be coming up on the century anniversary of that.\n\nAnd so, the poem I'm going to read is a persona poem, and it's in the voice of a train bringing black people up from the South during the Great Migration to Chicago. And the poem begins with a line from the report that was commissioned by the state to evaluate the causes of the race riot, so that line is: \"The presence of Negroes in large numbers in our great cities is not a menace in itself.\"\n\nThe poem is called, \"The Train Speaks:\"\n\n\"Even now, I dream of them. All my babies. Quiet nights in the rail yard when the little feet skitter beneath me, when the last of the strong men with his gleaming silver buttons has locked the door and laid his hands against me, warm palms offering a silent farewell.\n\nI see them dancing in every passing cloud. My babies, my babies, born unto me in the hills and green lands, loose threads catching in my sharp parts when they don't watch out, blistered hands hauling parcels of burlap as hefty and shapeless as bound cotton. They move like rabbits then. They look for a lash that isn't there. Even them that never felt it. It's in their shoulders. The lash lives in their shoulders.\n\nLong after the last biscuit is gone, when the sunrise brings steel mountains, my children look and look through the space I have made for them. The gift I prepared. They are safe within but can see without. They feel it before they know the words, then smile when it comes to them. It's flat. The land is flat. And they smile to think of it, this new place, the uncle or cousin who will greet them, the hat they will buy, the ribbons. They know not the cold, my babies. They know not the men who are waiting and angry. They know not that the absence of signs does not portend the absence of danger. My innocent children, my precious ones, I can never take you home. You have none. But, oh, if I could keep you here, safe in my iron heart, I would never let you go out into the wind.\"\n\nThe end! (Laughs.)\n\nJS: Briefly, Eve, the context of the poem.\n\nEE: So, the 1919 race riots happened sort of in the still beginning phase of the Great Migration, which brought unprecedented migration in the scale of the United States and much of human history, and brought massive numbers of black people from the South into the industrialized North. And my grandmother moved from Mississippi to the North when she was five years old. And if folks are interested in learning more about that, I highly recommend Isabel Wilkerson's award-winning book, \"The Warmth of Other Suns,\" which captures oral histories from people who participated in the Great Migration.\n\nBut before I get to the story of the riot, I wanted to just talk about that movement. And I love trains. I've always loved trains, I love riding trains. And I think that the train has an interesting sort of symbolic resonance in black culture in America, both because the train was often used as like a metaphor for freedom. Langston Hughes has a famous poem called \"Freedom Train,\" the Underground Railroad obviously, and for many people, the train actually became the real pathway to their freedom.\n\nAnd so I wanted to think about what it meant to regard these folks who came up North from a warm, lush, verdant place where they also were living under the threat of racial terrorism, to a North where they were hoping to find a different life and where there was still violence but a different kind of violence that perhaps they weren't prepared for. And I wanted to view them from the perspective of someone that would see them with love and care and nurturing. And the train is that, right? It's this kind of loving, caring thing that envelops you and shepherds you from one place to the next.\n\nYeah, and so that's the poem. I read it the other day in Battle Creek, Michigan, which I didn't know until I got there, is the resting place of Sojourner Truth. She's buried in Battle Creek, so I got to visit her cemetery and her resting place.\n\nAnd a woman in the audience, I could see this elderly woman in the back and like the whole time she was just grinning and smiling and like making noise and celebrating me as I was on stage. And afterwards, she came up and told me that the poem was so amazing and special to her because she remembers coming up North and she remembers being seven years old. And I said, \"You remember the train?\" She said, \"Oh honey, I remember everything. I remember picking cotton in Mississippi and I remember leaving and we came up here and my uncles went to Chicago and we kept going and we landed here in Battle Creek.\"\n\nAnd so, it's a part of our history that I think is really important and beautiful and also is special because our elders are still here to tell us about it. And I think it's important for us to capture it as much as possible.\n\nSo I'm hoping that, you know, the poem and the book more broadly will invite people to think about a chapter of our history that we often, I think, don't talk about as much as we should but that actually shapes the fabric of the cities and the country that we live in today.\n\nJS: What a great note to end on.

      "text": "The Radical Imagination of Eve Ewing\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe \"Electric Arches\" author talks about being a public school science teacher, the white CIA operative in \"Black Panther,\" guns, Chicago and much more.\n\nEvery week on Intercepted, we examine various threads of power and their impact on our society and on everyday people's lives. We speak to journalists, lawmakers, lawyers, and activists about war, about guns, about racism, and political hypocrisy. But we also have made a commitment to feature the work and voices of artists and musicians and poets and writers. These folks play a unique role in our society, particularly at moments like the one we currently live in.\n\nOne such artist is Dr. Eve Ewing. She's actually much more than just an artist. She's a sociologist of education and a writer from Chicago. Her research has focused on racism, social inequality, urban policy, and the impact of these forces on American public schools and the lives of young people.\n\nShe has a new book out called, \"Electric Arches,\" which explores these issues by blending stark realism with the surreal and fantastic.  It's a beautiful collection of Eve's poetry, essays, and visual art.\n\nEve Ewing's latest book, \"Electric Arches.\" Illustration: Brianna McCarthy\n\nEve Ewing's latest book, \"Electric Arches.\"\n\nIllustration: Brianna McCarthy\n\nOn last week's episode, we aired an excerpt of our interview with Ewing. That audio is linked below. What follows is a transcript of our entire conversation with Ewing, where we discuss her book and art, her time as a science teacher in a public school, the white CIA operative in the Black Panther film, guns, how certain people use violence in Chicago to serve their political agendas, and much more.\n\nJeremy Scahill: Eve Ewing, welcome to Intercepted.\n\nEve Ewing: Thanks for having me.\n\nJS: Before we get into this new book \"Electric Arches,\" I want to first ask you: Because Donald Trump and his allies bring up Chicago so much and they make it sound, you know, that Chicago is the epicenter of this frightening violence in America, just your general response to the way that Chicago is talked about in this moment in time by a specific group of people in this country.\n\nEE: Yeah, I wrote an essay about this. But basically the way I feel about it is that it's very convenient to use Chicago as a symbol that is really for many people kind of like an effective dog-whistle. It frightens people. It's used in the service of the same kind of rhetoric that we heard in past presidential administrations with things like, \"welfare queens\" and \"crack babies.\" Right? These are these are racialized images that are meant to inspire fear and loathing in the hearts of Americans and to make them feel as though there's justification for any kind of extreme crackdown, right, that might happen afterwards.\n\nIt has nothing to do with an actual desire to help or care for uplift or support or nurture or even listen to people who actually live here, because if it did stem from that genuine desire, there would be so many different kinds of interventions like providing us with more social services and resources, helping us hold our elected officials accountable for our educational system, responding to the Department of Justice and their inquiry into the fact that the Chicago Police Department has longstanding - generations-long - systemic racism.\n\nThose are the things that would actually help Chicago, and Chicagoans will be quick to tell you that, but it's really not about us, it's really about using this symbol as a scary, violent, black place that is supposed to inspire fear in the hearts of Americans and unfortunately it works pretty well.\n\nJS: Right, and with this whole discussion now about guns in the United States and the school shootings and now so many young people walking out, confronting politicians and political figures, the refrain from the right and from Trump is always, \"Well, if you care about guns, why aren't you doing anything about Chicago?\" And the reality is that the overwhelming majority of the gun-related problems in this country are not coming out of Chicago. The problem is that we have a gun culture where people are addicted, and they're largely white males, to stockpiling very high-powered weapons.\n\nEE: Yeah, and the thing is that, you know, people here do fight violence every single day. There are so many community organizers and leaders and educators that not only stand against gun violence, not only actually show up to the vigils of the young people that are lost in our communities all the time, but are attuned to the deeper issues and reasons and committed to the city and are committed to actually unpacking the reasons behind this violence.\n\nAgain this is - you're exactly right. This is, it's really rhetoric, it's using the city as a stand-in for fear and it's really, quite frankly, very insulting to tell people, you know, why don't you do anything about the violence in Chicago, when folks have no desire to learn about or uplift the people who do that work, that is really quite thankless work every single day.\n\nAnd I am really, really grateful and moved and excited by the younger folks that are stepping up and speaking out against gun violence. And what I really, really hope, and I think that I have reason to believe that this hope is going to come to fruition, what I really hope is that they can form meaningful coalitions and solidarity between students who are from wealthier, whiter communities saying that, \"We don't want this to happen in our community again\" and young people from places like Baltimore, places like Chicago places where this violence is an everyday reality. Those young people want the same things they want to show up and be safe at school, they want jobs they want to see a future for themselves and I'm really excited by the possibility of that solidarity.\n\nAt the time we're having this conversation, this week we saw the National School Walkout. And I shared a video on Twitter of a young woman, [a] 16-year-old black girl who was participating in the exact same kinds of walkouts that we saw these inspiring photos of all over the country, and she is arrested. And she's peacefully protesting and is arrested. And she is not facing any charges, but that's a trauma that she's going to have to live with for the rest of her life. And so I just want to invite people across the country to understand that even as we see young people speaking up and speaking out, the consequences for those young people are still widely divergent based on things like race and class. And it's our job as adults to support them and also help them see these points of solidarity and be hyper-aware of those young people for whom speaking up and exercising their right to free speech really puts them at risk, and those are undocumented students, students of color, students with disabilities, trans students, the same kids that are facing risk and vulnerability every single day just for being who they are. We have to protect them and make sure that they have a chance to exercise their free speech rights as well.\n\nJS: And you wrote this great essay for [The] Fader that was called \"Black Life And Death In A Familiar America.\"\n\nEE: Oh, thank you for reading that. It's very depressing.\n\nJS: Well yes, but we always say on this show that history and context matter, and I think the nuance that you're writing with is really refreshing and really essential. I just want to share with people part of that.\n\nYou were writing about Mount Greenwood, which is a neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago that is different from what you might imagine the way that the South Side of Chicago is talked about. And you write: \"Mt. Greenwood residents became excited at the mere mention of his name, and for a moment the altercation had the tone of a spontaneous campaign rally. They began to chant 'Donald Trump,' and one of them directly addressed the young black woman holding the camera, 'Build that wall! We'll fuckin' put you on the other side, motherfucker!' I watched him through a screen, through another screen, through the eyes of another. I closed my eyes and imagined what it would be like to look at him through a chain-link fence.\"\n\nWas this an event that signaled to you that Donald Trump's vision for America was sort of alive and well even in patches of this part of the country in Chicago that's talked about so much before he was even elected?\n\nEE: Yeah, absolutely. Thank you. That was a beautiful reading. I really appreciate it.\n\nYeah, so that piece was published the day after the election, and the event that I'm describing there took place before the election. And so I think that timing is important to illustrate exactly what you're saying, which is that during the Trump campaign and then right after he was elected, there was a lot of justifiable and understandable fear, hand-wringing, and shock, especially from corners of liberal, white America where people thought, basically, this was a referendum that made them realize that the America that they thought they lived in does not exist. Or this election constituted a transformational, historical event that somehow gave permission or highlighted new forms of racism or new forms of xenophobia.\n\nIn no way do I want to undercut what I do think have been some of the uniquely awful aspects of this administration, but I also think it's important for folks to remember that this is not like the man in a laboratory conjuring up these racist people like Frankensteins, who had never existed - you know, Frankenstein monsters that never existed. Rather it is him giving a voice and a platform for an energy behind white supremacy and hatred that has a long history in America and that actually, in my opinion, constitutes the very fabric of the nation.\n\nAnd so I think that that's important to realize, because it makes you understand that in order to conquer or change or transform the kind of hatred and vile evil that we're seeing right now, it's not just about these particular voters, it's not just about this particular election, but we have to be brave enough to confront and understand a history that is much deeper and an aspect of this culture that runs very, very deep.\n\nAnd basically, like, the America that people feared was going to come into fruition or come to reality already existed before the election. And these folks were more than happy to use this president as a sort of projection of the energy that they already had and the opinions that they already had.\n\nJS: Now, unlike Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, you've actually spent quite a bit of time in public schools.\n\nEE: (Laughs.) Yes, yes I have.\n\nJS: And taught public schools. And her proposal, and it's not just hers, but now she's sort of in charge of it, this idea of arming teachers.\n\nEE: Mhmm. To fight the bears that are gonna -\n\nJS: Well, although, maybe, I've still been trying to find out if grizzly bears are a euphemism for a group of people and we just aren't hip to it. But just in general, your thoughts about that, and what it sort of indicates about the moment we're in?\n\nEE: Yeah, so, there's so much. There are so many things wrong with this idea that it's really hard to even wrap your mind around where to begin.\n\nYou know, when I was a public school teacher, I spent an average of $100 a week on supplies for my own students, especially because when I started out I was teaching science and I was the only science teacher for the entire middle school, so I had about 170 students that I taught science to every week, 6th, 7th, and 8th graders.\n\nJS: Wow.\n\nEE: And I was committed to - yeah, just me - I mean, you know, they got subjects from other people, but I was the only person teaching science to 170 kids. And I was committed to providing them the best inquiry-based science education that I possibly could, which meant I didn't just want them to read about things in textbooks, I wanted them to do all the things that so many of us remember as being the fun things that allow you to see how science actually works and bring it to life. I wanted them to connect circuits. I wanted them to look at things under microscopes. Right? And all those things cost money.\n\nAnd so I would spend massive amounts of money every week. I would make my lesson plans on Sunday and then on Monday I would go to Home Depot and I would go to Radio Shack and I would go to the pet store to get the food to feed our class pets and animals we had in the classroom, and all those things came out of my pocket. And I never heard you know the secretary of education or any of these people out here outraged and wanting to arm me with the actual things that I needed to do my job every week.\n\nAt the end of the year, I was entitled to a $100 reimbursement, and I would just pick whatever random receipts I had from that week and use it to file for my union-entitled $100 reimbursement.\n\nAnd so, to hear these same folks in the name of protecting students or protecting lives talking about how we should arm teachers, many teachers have risen up and said: \"Arm us with pencils, arm us with nurses, right? Arm us with social workers.\" We had a social worker to serve our entire school who is serving multiple schools and she would come once a week, right? And try to give service to whoever she could in that limited time.\n\nThese are very common - counselors, people to just help with basic disabilities with all kinds of things that we actually need in terms of resources, and once again, it betrays that none of this is actually about helping anybody but it's about reinforcing an agenda of control and militarization.\n\nAnd the other thing, you know, lots of teachers have said this kind of rhetoric of like, \"Arm us with the things we actually need.\" Which I agree with, and I also want to add to that when people sign up to be teachers, they want to be educators. They sign up to transform lives to nurture young people, to support people that are in need, to help shape their minds, to help them discover the things about themselves that are wonderful and special and their gifts and their talents and interests. That's why I wanted to be a teacher. I didn't want to be a teacher so that I would be a frontline soldier. And I don't think that that the teachers of America should have to worry about volunteering their lives or making the decisions between going home to their families that day and sacrificing themselves for the children in their classroom. And I don't think that that is something to be ashamed of. To say, \"I didn't sign up for this job to potentially die.\" You know, and to be a soldier. I think that is perfectly reasonable.\n\nWhen I was a teacher, I spent plenty of time sort of envisioning in my head my own sort of plan if there ever was an active shooter in the building, you know, looking at the students before me and thinking, \"OK, which one could I count on to run over and grab my keys,\" or if I say, \"Everybody needs to get under the desk,\" who's the one who always is going to say, \"Why do we have to do that, Miss Ewing?'\" Basically trying to make these plans in my head that accounted for the actual kids in front of me that I knew and that I loved. And that's just really messed up. That's brain space that I shouldn't have had to dedicate to thinking about how I would protect the kids in my care, and hopefully escape with my life. And to validate that and further uplift it by talking about giving teachers guns is just morally reprehensible to me.\n\nJS: Well, and we've also seen in this era of social media, you were mentioning Twitter before, videos that young people are posting of staff inside of schools assaulting students, and this is not even having a gun.\n\nEE: Absolutely\n\nJS: I mean my real fear about guns in school is that these altercations where we've seen, you know, staff at schools slamming black children down or putting them in a headlock or restraining them by extreme force or doing other things that may not be physical assault but are meant to humiliate them in retribution, in revenge for some perceived slight - that now you're going to have some of these hotheads in schools, not necessarily teachers but other staffers who have guns? And what are those altercations going to look like now if those staffers have guns on them?\n\nEE: I think you're absolutely right. And we also already have police and these SROs, these security resource officers, in schools, and there are many, many students in this country that attend schools that have security or police presence and no counselors to help them get to college. That is despicable.\n\nAnd I think you're right. You know, I think about the black children murdered across this country, who will never make it to high school because someone thought they were dangerous. I think about Tamir Rice, I think about Aiyana Stanley, and the idea that we would further introduce that dynamic into schools, a place where children are supposed to feel safe and where many of them already do not, it's just bad policy.\n\nJS: Now you've mentioned being a science teacher. I have to say one of my most favorite pieces in your new book, \"Electric Arches\" is the piece called \"The Device.\"\n\nEE: Oh, thank you.\n\nJS: I think it's really interesting. I think for a lot of young black kids who are interested in coding and tech, I think this is going to be a really inspirational story for them.\n\nEE: Oh, thank you.\n\nThis is the first paragraph of the short story, \"The Device:\"\n\n\"It wasn't like a George Washington Carver kind of thing, where one brilliant Negro with a soldering iron made some magic and poof! A miraculous machine. It was an open-source kind of situation. Thousands of high school science-fair whiz kids, this and that engineering club at this and that technical college, the One Black Person at a bunch of Silicon Valley startups getting together with a bunch of other One Black Persons over craft beer and coding late into the night, even some government folks working off the clock (or so the rumors go). Not just one person. A hive mind of black nerds, obsessive types, scientists, and inventors but also historians and archaeologists and the odd astrologer here and there. Project Delta Mother, they called it (goofy name TBH but it's whatever).\"\n\nSo that's the beginning of this short story, \"The Device.\" And the story is about, as is described in that first paragraph, a collective group of black scientists across the country who build this machine and the purpose of the machine is to allow you to communicate with your ancestors.\n\nAnd the story describes the first time that the machine is turned on, and the little girl who is selected to be like the test pilot flips the switch and finds herself communicating with her ancestors over space and time. And it doesn't go exactly as everybody thinks it's going to go.\n\nAnd I wrote that story, I was invited to give a reading at the Art Institute of Chicago in the African art gallery. And so I was - so I had some time to tour the gallery by myself and check it out. And this doesn't end the way it ends in \"Black Panther,\" where then I like, executed a careful heist of the artifacts. That did not happen. What happened was, I was looking at a mask, and there was a series of West African masks that were supposed to enable the wearer to basically channel the spirits of their ancestors and so they were used in different rituals and events where somebody would wear them and then they would embody the spirits of the people that had gone before them. And I thought about what a powerful idea that was for African-Americans, for those of us for whom our lineage is necessarily cut off by chattel slavery.\n\nI have a tattoo on my right shoulder blade of my matrilineal genealogy, and it goes back to my mom, my grandma, my great-grandma, back to my great, great grandmother who died a free person but was born an enslaved person. And because she's considered property and record-keeping is spotty, I don't have any access to the people who came before her.\n\nAnd I thought a lot - this is something that African-Americans specifically wrestle with a lot in this country, especially as we consider our place in the diaspora and sometimes get messages from other people in the diaspora that, you know, we don't have a real history or that slavery is something we should be ashamed of and it doesn't give us access to kind of a national identity or an understanding of who our ancestors were.\n\nAnd so I wanted to grapple with that idea and think about, you know, what if we could use science to talk to them. And then I thought like, \"Do we really want to talk to our ancestors?\" Like, our ancestors are family and do you always want to talk to your family, and sometimes family is annoying, or they bother you about things or they hassle you, or they don't get certain aspects of who you are. And I tried to think about what it actually means to not just consider our ancestors as these like mythical, magical people, but as human beings with their own opinions and thoughts and unexpected quirks. So that's kind of where the story came from.\n\nJS: Yeah, it's a great story.\n\nEE: Thank you.\n\nJS: And I encourage people to read it. I think it's so important, I mean young people in general, I think need to, I mean obviously it's great if they can be more excited about science because science is one of the ways that we counteract the kind of culture that now exists in Washington and with the current administration. You mentioned, you mentioned Black Panther there, and I, therefore, have to ask or point out that your current Twitter name is Wikipedia \"Killmonger, But Make It Feminist\" brown.\n\nEE: Yes.\n\nJS: What did you make of the white CIA guy who is helping Wakanda?\n\nEE: Yeah. That's so deep. I could go on about this for a long time. But, I think that Ryan Coogler situated the movie so - I mean these questions about diaspora are so - that is to me, is like the center of the movie. And I mean, if you haven't seen a movie at this point, it's on you. So all the spoiler alerts, obviously.\n\nBut, you know, I went to the movie expecting like a great action movie, and what I got is this movie that presents these actual serious ethical dilemmas about our like Pan-African identity and blackness and what kinds of responsibilities we have to each other in history, and you know the whole time I was sitting in the movie with my partner, and he kept like, every time Killmonger made like a speech, he would just lean over and say, \"He's not wrong, he's got a point.\" Right?\n\nAnd of course, upon further analysis we think about the fact that his, you know, basically what he wants to do is recreate empire and recreate white supremacy, right? Hence my hence my Twitter name \"Killmonger, But Make It Feminist.\" Right? Make it about restoration and reparation and not about recreating empire and harm and colonialism.\n\nSo anyway, to get your actual question, I think that you know Coogler, coming from Oakland understands so much about the work that intelligence government, intelligence agencies did and have done and continue to do into the present I might add, to try to undermine black freedom movements.\n\nAnd so it's really deep that T'Challa trusts the CIA guy, and I think it says something about him that's really interesting and worth investigating, the fact that, he sees himself as having a solidarity with him in a need to save his life based on the individual interactions that they've had, that might be very different from how an African-American person would view him as a symbol of an evil institution or maybe he's just being pragmatic. I don't know. But he really let that man in to see like all their technology and everything. I was like, \"No! What are you doing?\" So, yeah.\n\nJS: One of the thoughts I had, and I have to say I know Ryan Coogler personally, and I met him when he was working on his first film \"Fruitvale Station\" and I was working on a documentary at the time, we were mixing sound for our films at the same time, and then he and I were kind of on the circuit together, and now he's blown up. He did \"Creed.\"\n\nEE: Yeah.\n\nJS: Which is, probably, I think the best Rocky movie, if not the best, the best since the original. But, I mean, that was an amazing film.\n\nEE: It's so good.\n\nJS: And, Black Panther, I'm going to go and see it again, because I am very interested in that CIA character.\n\nHere's my theory, Eve. I think that it's possible that they're introducing him, and that T'Challa and others in Wakanda think, \"Well, yeah, we know who he is, but he seems to be like with us on this particular thing.\" And I'm hoping that it's a metaphor for how the CIA has always functioned in colonial territories, where they say, \"Oh, we're here to help you,\" or \"We'll help you on this thing,\" and then later you realize who they really are and that we see like an uprising of Wakanda against the CIA. That's my hope.\n\nEE: Well and that's one of the things where, you know, one of the masterful narrative arcs of the movie is that in the beginning we see Sterling K. Brown's character, we see them, it seems like they're planning some sort of heist or robbery or something like that. And what we come to understand is that actually, he has gone to the United States and learned about black freedom movements from African-American people and learned about this diasporic history and so his perspective is one of black solidarity across kind of nationhood, and he sees himself as having responsibilities for folks.\n\nT'Challa doesn't, he doesn't feel that way. And, you know, so we expect him to have sort of a pan-Africanist lens that there's no reason why he would actually have having grown up in Wakanda, and so his obligations are individualized, right? And it's one way in which the loss of his uncle means the loss of another kind of wisdom that he could have really benefited from.\n\nAnd, you know, the funny part is that like his sort of compromise of his radical ideology is that he's going to go like participate in the nonprofit industrial complex in Oakland, and start, you know, basically be a housing owner and start some sort of after-school program. And people on Twitter are joking he's going to start a charter school.\n\nJS: (Laughs.)\n\nEE: And partner with like, P. Diddy and Common to run a charter school in Oakland. And I think that these are real critiques. Right? These are real critiques about the way some black people see participation and essentially like black capitalism as a pathway to freedom which is very different than what Killmonger had in mind before he gave his incredibly corny last words. (Laughs.)\n\nJS: Well, we're going to, you can be our movie critic from now on.\n\nEE: Yeah. Anytime, anytime.\n\nJS: So going to back to the book, one thing I also want people to be aware of, this is not simply a book of poetry or a collection of poetry and short stories. You also have visual art that you have created. Can you talk about how that's deployed throughout the book and how you make your visual art because it's interesting the trade that you use?\n\nEE: Thank you. Yeah, well, you know one book that really inspired \"Electric Arches\" was \"Citizen\" by Claudia Rankine. And I was amazed at the idea of incorporating visual art as, in service of perpetuating some of the ideas and thoughts that are central to the book and themes that are central to the book, but also, to be quite honest, as a way of just forcing people to have encounters with visual art.\n\nI find that, you know, poetry already as an art form is something that people have a lot of like sort of mystified mythos about, where many people think of it as very inaccessible or very hard to understand or they think that they need some kind of special training to understand it - like a class - it's confusing and so on. And I find that visual art often has the same reputation, especially contemporary art where people, you know they say things like, \"Well, I don't really know anything about art, or I don't get art, or I don't like modern art.\" Right? And often misusing the term modern for contemporary.\n\nAnd so part of what I want to do is invite people to have encounters with visual works as part of their encounter with text, and also basically to think of - I always think of the book as an object itself, and I want it to be in engaging object, and so that's why, for example, there are pages that are white text on a black background, rather than the other way around, and the cover is extremely engaging and the book is square. These are all things that make me - that I, that I did or that I wanted to do to kind of invite people to engage the book as an object as a physical thing and not only as something that lives in your head. And so that's why the visual art is there.\n\nI just did it because I could and I wanted to. That's the other reason. I had this amazing press that kind of let me do whatever I wanted, so I was like, \"Well, I want to put art in there.\" So I did.\n\nJS: Well, and one of your inventions is the decoder rings that used to come in cereal boxes.\n\nEE: Yeah!\n\nJS: And the one you've cooked up in your imagination allows the wearer to be able to understand what black girls are saying.\n\nEE: Yes, yes.\n\nJS: You could make that, you could probably make that and I bet it would catch on across this country.\n\nEE: Oh, what I could do is I could make it and then sell it on Etsy and then one of the Kardashians would copy it without my permission and then sell it for like thousands and thousands of dollars. And then, that would be like the natural life cycle of my invention. (Laughs.)\n\nJS: That's never happened to black creators in this country.\n\nEE: Yeah, right. Exactly.\n\nJS: There's no stealing of work.\n\nEE: (Laughs.) Yeah, I made that, sort of like childhood and playfulness are recurring themes in the book, and in my own life, and so, it's really: The black girl decoder ring is kind of playing with the fact that so much of popular culture is based on this sort of two-faced desire of black women, where on the one hand there's like a desire to imitate and to copy and to steal, you know beauty and body styles and hairstyles and things like that, but that's also coupled with a disrespect and like invisibility and even disgust with or like, sense of contempt for like actual black women and black women's bodies. And so the decoder ring is sort of like the thing that Taylor Swift or Katy Perry gets to wear, that will allow them the thing they most desire which is to be able to understand and fully access what black women are doing and saying without actually engaging with them as human beings. And I thought about that kind of translational work and the idea of like this cereal box toy that you could get.\n\nJS: If we had sound effects, I would be hitting like a boom sound effect. #takethattaylor. Another thing that I really find fun about your book is that you take well-known figures and then you place them in kind of different magical situations.\n\nEE: Yeah.\n\nJS: One of those is the blues legend Koko Taylor, and then a very famous person, the king, LeBron James.\n\nEE: The king himself.\n\nJS: Right, and I mean I want you to tell the story, but I mean the essence of it is LeBron James is sort of going through time and then he runs into or seeks out his teenage self. You'll do the job of describing it better than I would, but talk about that, and if you want to share part of it, that's cool, but if not, you can just talk about it. Either way, it's up to you.\n\nEE: Yeah, so I'll read this poem, it's called \"Note from LeBron James to LeBron James\":\n\n\"I knew it was you when I saw you in the parking lot, headphones on, waiting for Drew to come up with the car and trying not to eat all the chips before he got there. The tip of each finger of each hand finding its own minute ridged seam on the waistband of your shorts.\n\nI knew it was you from the way you smiled when you saw how lean my shoulders, how spare my triceps. I knew it was you because you haven't yet seen what will come after, the days when I was a ballast for every vessel I blinked at, an impossible man, when I was not the leg-lift or the quickstep or the hoist, I was the tire, the hurdle, the rope itself - I was the trial itself, and you can't know that yet.\n\nLeaning against nothing there in the sunlight, me kicking at sticky black pebbles sprung loose from the tar while you stood firm in your new shoes a few inches up on the curb where the melting street couldn't sully them, and both of us wanting lunch and touching our hips absentmindedly and listening to a jet pass overhead, the hum of a Saturday, and looking down the road toward where Portage Path would be, except too far past the oaks to see and us not really thinking about that anyway. I couldn't tell you.\n\nWhen it's time to roll you have to keep everybody tethered to you, no matter how heavy or hungry or ugly they get, you have to keep their soreness and their worst parts and their smashed tin wants and their construction paper crowns and their everything they ever wanted for you and for them in the same backpack with the shredded bottom where you keep your own drawings and scraped knuckles and your being afraid. Keep them like a secret. I couldn't tell you that just then.\"\n\nEE: So that poem - I'm putting my glasses back on - so that poem is, you know, LeBron James, like many people I have - OK. Something I find interesting about sports, growing up in like a fierce sports city like Chicago, is that sports are really about our collective societal desires. Right? They're about us projecting our hopes and our dreams and our desire to win and be victorious on to these like gladiators who are these incredible human beings.\n\nYou know, LeBron James, as a person, his very physiology is miraculous. Right? Like how can somebody be so big and so strong and also so fast and leap in the air and spin around and do things that like a figure skater would do? But also be so incredibly strong.\n\nAnd when I was a kid, you know the United Center in Chicago, now they've moved it inside, but my entire childhood there was this big famous iconic statue of Michael Jordan, and it's him leaping into the air and has this quote from the novel \"A River Runs Through It\" by Norman Maclean. And then it has, the inscription on the statue says: \"The best there ever was, the best there ever will be.\" Which is like such an amazing, I've always loved that phrase because there's such a hubris to it, right? It's like you have no way of possibly knowing that this is the greatest basketball player that will ever live, but you're speaking it. Right? Like this is like a prophecy. \"The best there ever was, the best there ever will be.\"\n\nAnd so that's like a big part of what I love about basketball - sports in general, but like that's my choice. I think also a lot of people see that same kind of heroism in football. But for me, growing up in Chicago in the '90s, right, basketball is everything.\n\nAnd so - but these are human beings. And I'm interested in, you know, with basketball there's these mythologies, the \"Hoop Dreams\" mythology of the kid on the street who basically achieves the American dream, where, you know he comes from poverty and just works really hard and has this incredible God-given skill and is able to rise up and be successful and buy his mother a house. And, you know, rapping kind of offers the same kind of American dream mythology, like hip-hop culture.\n\nBut the thing is that, you know, I'm also a sociologist and there's some interesting research that shows that NBA players are, for the most part, they come from families that have higher median incomes than most black people in the United States, and so the majority of NBA players are more like Steph Curry than LeBron James. Right? They are more people that, they come from families that have the money and the resources to get them to practice on time, get their uniforms ready, make sure that they are where they're supposed to be, have flexible jobs that allow them to support these things, and help them be on traveling teams, have the academic opportunities that enable that they're going to be able to play.\n\nAnd so it turns out that even though we have this mythology about basketball as this like the American dream, bootstrap space, in actuality it's just another part of America where your class background actually matters a lot for your outcomes.\n\nAnd, so because of all that, people like LeBron James who actually come from poverty are really remarkable to me in basketball, and so I started reading about his biography and his childhood, and basically the fact that at a very young age his outcomes for his, like his own life, but also the life of his family and his loved ones seem to sit very squarely on his shoulders, and his family's entire life, his mother basically uprooted their family and moved them into somebodies house so that he would be able to have consistent coaching and training. And she had him when she was a teenager.\n\nAnd also as a person who's also from a post-industrial Midwestern city, I have a lot of solidarity and love for Cleveland, and when LeBron James, when he did \"The Decision\" and when he announced that he was leaving Cleveland and he was going to go to Miami, I had this big giant poster of him in my classroom, I was teaching middle school, and I had this huge poster of LeBron James, and I ripped it off the wall. (Laughs.)\n\nJS: Wow!\n\nEE: Because I felt so betrayed that he was leaving the Midwest, and my students came in and were like, \"Miss E, where's LeBron?\" I was like, \"Shh, shh, shh. We're not talking about it - we don't speak his name in here, children.\" You know?\n\nAnd so, when he wrote this heartfelt essay - or you know if you co-wrote it with somebody, I don't know - but he wrote this heartfelt essay talking about how he was going to come back to Cleveland and about how part of it was because he wanted kids growing up in northeast Ohio to basically believe that it was possible to stay home and be right where you're from, right where you were born and like, be great, and accomplish great things for yourself and your family and your community, that meant so much to me.\n\nAnd so I wrote this time-traveling poem for him to kind of encounter his younger, his younger self.\n\nJS: Has he seen it?\n\nEE: To my knowledge, he has not seen it. I have one, as far as I know, I have exactly one NBA fan, who is Andre Iguodala, my fellow Chicagoan, and has been extremely supportive of the book, and has posted it on Instagram and stuff him.\n\nJS: Come on, Craig Hodges is at your same publisher.\n\nEE: I know, I know.\n\nJS: Haymarket, get on that!\n\nEE: I know, he's in the Haymarket gang with. I know, somebody, but as far as I know, the real-live people in the book, as far as I know, none of them have read any of the poems. It's Marilyn Mosby, Erykah Badu, LeBron James, Koko Taylor passed away, I did get a chance to meet her before she passed, which was amazing.\n\nJS: Oh nice. Metta World Peace?\n\nEE: Metta World Peace, no, and Stacey Dash, no. I don't think any of them have read any of these poems and I don't know what they would think about them.\n\nJS: Maybe LeBron James is a closet listener to this podcast.\n\nEE: Maybe!\n\nJS: He wants to be an expert on CIA drone strikes.\n\nEE: (Laughs.) You know for years, I grind my teeth and so I wear a mouthpiece when I go to sleep.\n\nJS: Don't wear it when Michael B. Jordan takes off his shirt.\n\nEE: (Laughs.) I know, right? Hopefully, that does not happen to me. But I wear a mouthpiece when I go to sleep because I grind my teeth and clench my jaw, and because I wear before I go to bed I have these - I sort of associate it with like peace and calm and like serenity and sleeping. And so for years, I wanted to write a poem about my mouthpiece. And Blake Griffin wrote one as a joke for a commercial, he wrote like a fake, like a poem, like an ode to his mouthpiece and I'm really angry that Blake Griffin beat me to the mouthpiece poem. So that's my only like, NBA poetry beef is that I'm salt about that. But if he ever wanted to collaborate on a poem, I would also be fine with that as well.\n\nJS: Fair enough. Before we, you and I, started talking today I was asking my colleagues, the producers of the show, what they thought of the book. And one of my colleagues, her favorite poem in the book was \"Appletree\" which, you mentioned, Erykah Badu, \"[on black womanhood, from and to Erykah Badu].\" So maybe you can you can lay that out for people and explain that piece.\n\nEE: So I'm going to read the first of seven section of this poem, called \"Appletree [on black womanhood, from and to Erykah Badu]\"\n\n\"First: The year Baduism came out was the same year I had sex ed for the first time. Not the kind with feelings or warnings or photographs, it was the vocabulary kind of sex ed. The kind with diagrams and purple inked diddle lines. And I was bad at remembering which words went with which shapes on the page and so at school I learned that my body was a worksheet, full of blank spaces and mysterious menacing forms and the best I could hope was that someone more knowledgeable than I was would know what to do with them.\n\nWhen I came home every day my mother would be playing the CD on repeat. You would begin and begin again. Oh, what a day. And I would sigh along with you and it was the first time I understood that the violet waxy blobs of my insides were circles spun with a lazy finger.\n\nThere's a small sun in there, you said, a cup of tea. There's a stone that moves of its own volition tracing a path each day from my throat to the soles of my feet and back up across the muscles of my thighs over my spine. It's a boulder without a Sisyphus. I learned that everything about me could be round and full if I let it, that under my skin were ciphers of humming and laughing and buzzing, stones laid in a labyrinth that turns and turns in on itself, so when you get to the center you have no choice but to turn around and walk the other way. What a day. What a day.\"\n\nEE: So, yeah, the poem is kind of like, an ode to Erykah Badu, or a tribute to her. You know, the book overall, is like coming of age in black girlhood and black womanhood, with the obvious understanding that those things are not monoliths. Right? And so this is like my particular story and my particular life and I hope that some people find things that are true in it, and other things maybe not so much.\n\nBut Erykah Badu, you know, was a very important figure in popular culture who kind of helped me understand a different version of black womanhood and what it means to be a black woman than I saw in other aspects of popular culture, in the media. And obviously this is changing to a degree and I think improving a lot, and its been amazing to see in the last couple of years, but for a lot of us growing up, for my mothers' generation, there were just very, very few black women in media. I mean, that's why seeing Nichelle Nichols in \"Star Trek\" was so important for so many young women, right? They were like, it's a black woman on a spaceship, that's amazing. You know, or seeing news anchors or things like that.\n\nBut for my generation, you know, there were black women, but there were just these very limited ideas of, you know, what it looked like to be a black woman, what kind of person you were allowed to be, and it just felt very limiting and very flat and two-dimensional. And Erykah Badu is just this really sort of strange, ethereal, otherworldly, wise character who came on the scene and just celebrated a different vision of what it meant to be a black woman than I had seen growing up.\n\nAnd her playfulness, her kind of irreverence, the fact that she could sing in the same way that the music that my parents or grandparents listened to, she had that kind of vocal ability, but hearing the song, \"Tyrone,\" right? Hearing a woman sing with this beautiful, incredible voice about like, throwing a dude out because he never pays for anything, and like, he has to come pick up all his stuff from your house, right? These are just like these true stories about life that also seem to, for me, restore some sense of agency or autonomy to the body, and that it's OK to have a body and your body is your body.\n\nAnd so, that was really important to me, and so I wanted to write that kind of love letter to her, and to what her work has accomplished, even though a lot of the things that she says now, I'm like, \"I really wish you wouldn't say that, Erykah.\" We don't know each other, so she doesn't contact me and ask me what she should say in these interviews, and if she did, I might give some different advice, but her work is just incredibly important to me and really means a lot to me.\n\nJS: Wow. Well, as we wrap up our conversation, I want to encourage everybody to pick up this book by Eve Ewing, which is called \"Electric Arches.\" And Eve has generously offered to share some unpublished poetry with us today, and I'm going to hand the reins over to her to do a short reading here, on Intercepted.\n\nEE: Well thank you again, so much, for having me. It's been delightful.\n\nSo, I'm going to read a poem from a new project that I have coming out in 2019. And the project, it's also coming out with Haymarket, it's called \"1919,\" and it's about the race riots that happened in Chicago in 1919, which obviously we'll be coming up on the century anniversary of that.\n\nAnd so, the poem I'm going to read is a persona poem, and it's in the voice of a train bringing black people up from the South during the Great Migration to Chicago. And the poem begins with a line from the report that was commissioned by the state to evaluate the causes of the race riot, so that line is: \"The presence of Negroes in large numbers in our great cities is not a menace in itself.\"\n\nThe poem is called, \"The Train Speaks:\"\n\n\"Even now, I dream of them. All my babies. Quiet nights in the rail yard when the little feet skitter beneath me, when the last of the strong men with his gleaming silver buttons has locked the door and laid his hands against me, warm palms offering a silent farewell.\n\nI see them dancing in every passing cloud. My babies, my babies, born unto me in the hills and green lands, loose threads catching in my sharp parts when they don't watch out, blistered hands hauling parcels of burlap as hefty and shapeless as bound cotton. They move like rabbits then. They look for a lash that isn't there. Even them that never felt it. It's in their shoulders. The lash lives in their shoulders.\n\nLong after the last biscuit is gone, when the sunrise brings steel mountains, my children look and look through the space I have made for them. The gift I prepared. They are safe within but can see without. They feel it before they know the words, then smile when it comes to them. It's flat. The land is flat. And they smile to think of it, this new place, the uncle or cousin who will greet them, the hat they will buy, the ribbons. They know not the cold, my babies. They know not the men who are waiting and angry. They know not that the absence of signs does not portend the absence of danger. My innocent children, my precious ones, I can never take you home. You have none. But, oh, if I could keep you here, safe in my iron heart, I would never let you go out into the wind.\"\n\nThe end! (Laughs.)\n\nJS: Briefly, Eve, the context of the poem.\n\nEE: So, the 1919 race riots happened sort of in the still beginning phase of the Great Migration, which brought unprecedented migration in the scale of the United States and much of human history, and brought massive numbers of black people from the South into the industrialized North. And my grandmother moved from Mississippi to the North when she was five years old. And if folks are interested in learning more about that, I highly recommend Isabel Wilkerson's award-winning book, \"The Warmth of Other Suns,\" which captures oral histories from people who participated in the Great Migration.\n\nBut before I get to the story of the riot, I wanted to just talk about that movement. And I love trains. I've always loved trains, I love riding trains. And I think that the train has an interesting sort of symbolic resonance in black culture in America, both because the train was often used as like a metaphor for freedom. Langston Hughes has a famous poem called \"Freedom Train,\" the Underground Railroad obviously, and for many people, the train actually became the real pathway to their freedom.\n\nAnd so I wanted to think about what it meant to regard these folks who came up North from a warm, lush, verdant place where they also were living under the threat of racial terrorism, to a North where they were hoping to find a different life and where there was still violence but a different kind of violence that perhaps they weren't prepared for. And I wanted to view them from the perspective of someone that would see them with love and care and nurturing. And the train is that, right? It's this kind of loving, caring thing that envelops you and shepherds you from one place to the next.\n\nYeah, and so that's the poem. I read it the other day in Battle Creek, Michigan, which I didn't know until I got there, is the resting place of Sojourner Truth. She's buried in Battle Creek, so I got to visit her cemetery and her resting place.\n\nAnd a woman in the audience, I could see this elderly woman in the back and like the whole time she was just grinning and smiling and like making noise and celebrating me as I was on stage. And afterwards, she came up and told me that the poem was so amazing and special to her because she remembers coming up North and she remembers being seven years old. And I said, \"You remember the train?\" She said, \"Oh honey, I remember everything. I remember picking cotton in Mississippi and I remember leaving and we came up here and my uncles went to Chicago and we kept going and we landed here in Battle Creek.\"\n\nAnd so, it's a part of our history that I think is really important and beautiful and also is special because our elders are still here to tell us about it. And I think it's important for us to capture it as much as possible.\n\nSo I'm hoping that, you know, the poem and the book more broadly will invite people to think about a chapter of our history that we often, I think, don't talk about as much as we should but that actually shapes the fabric of the cities and the country that we live in today.\n\nJS: What a great note to end on.

      "text": "We Need to Talk About Joe\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nPoet Aja Monet, organizer Astra Taylor, and Nathan Robinson of Current Affairs are this week's guests.\n\nBernie Sanders's insurgent campaign against the Democratic establishment and massive corporate power is in the fight of its life. This week on Intercepted: With Michigan and other states voting in primaries today, the justice movements backing the Sanders campaign are making the case that nominating Joe Biden to take on Donald Trump is a grave risk. Poet Aja Monet and organizer Astra Taylor discuss the mini-manifesto from a multi-generational, multi-racial coalition of feminists: \" Rising for a Global Feminist Future with the Movement to Elect Bernie Sanders .\" As Biden's campaign seeks to keep him away from open microphones and limit his public appearances, serious questions are being asked about Biden's mental health and his decades of right-wing positions and policies. Nathan Robinson, editor-in-chief of Current Affairs, discusses Biden's record on criminal justice, the climate crisis, women's reproductive rights, war, and trade. Robinson accurately predicted Trump would defeat Hillary Clinton, and he argues it will all happen again if Biden is the candidate in November. His latest article is titled, \" Democrats, You Really Do Not Want To Nominate Joe Biden .\"\n\nJoe Biden: I want to set the record straight on a couple of things.\n\n[Cheering.]\n\nJB: Corn Pop was a bad dude and he ran a bunch of bad boys. Not a joke. Remember the straight race, bang him on the curve, get him rusty, put him in a rain barrel, get 'em rusty. And I looked at him. I said, \"You may cut me, man but I'm gonna wrap this chain around your head.\" He said, \"OK, close your straight razor.\" My heart began to beat again.\n\n[Cheering.]\n\n[Music interlude.]\n\nJeremy Scahill: This is Intercepted.\n\n[Music interlude.]\n\nJS: I'm Jeremy Scahill, coming to you from the offices of The Intercept in New York City. And this is episode 120 of Intercepted.\n\nHillary Clinton: I will support the nominee of the Democratic Party.\n\nFareed Zakaria: But, will you campaign for him?\n\nHC: I don't know if he would ask me to campaign for him, Fareed.\n\nJS: There has been a pernicious lie told about Bernie Sanders since 2016 that he is somehow responsible for Hillary Clinton's loss to Donald Trump. Now set aside the fact that Clinton actually won the popular vote. Set aside the fact that Sanders did 39 rallies for Clinton in the last 90 days of the campaign. Set aside the fact that Hillary Clinton did not do any campaign events in Wisconsin. Set aside all of the obvious facts that make that statement laughable and consider this: Hillary Clinton ran as the epitome of an establishment Democrat against one of the most terrible people this country has ever produced, Donald Trump. And she lost.\n\nHC: I am incredibly honored and grateful to have had this chance to represent all of you in this consequential election. May God bless you and may God bless the United States of America.\n\n[Cheering.]\n\nJS: There were quite a few people in this country who warned the Democratic Party that this would happen. And it wasn't based on hatred for Hillary Clinton. It was based on sound reasoning and historical context. It was based on the knowledge that Hubert Humphrey never became president, that Michael Dukakis never became president, that Hillary Clinton failed to defeat Barack Obama in the primary in 2008.\n\nAnd back in 2017, Hillary Clinton wrote in her memoir that Sanders \"attacks caused lasting damage, making it harder to unify progressives in the general election.\" Now, I'm sorry, this analysis perfectly captures the attitude that corporate Democrats have toward so many voters, that they owe it to the corporate party to unify behind them even if those very voters have been harmed by the policies of the Democratic establishment. It is hostage-taking politics. And it is a bankrupt analysis.\n\nThe idea that Sanders's accurate warnings about the risks of a Clinton candidacy because of her corporate ties, disastrous trade policies, right-wing foreign policy, that that was somehow the defining factor in the 2016 general election is pure fantasy. And any \"damage\" that it may have done was far outweighed by the fact that Sanders' critique of Hilary Clinton was in fact, factually based. The policies and records were the damage. Bill Clinton's legacy was also part of the damage.\n\nAnd also, just as an aside, if we want to talk about nasty business in Democratic primaries, go back and look at the vicious operations that the Clinton campaign ran against Barack Obama in 2008 attempting to portray him as a scary Muslim and a Black nationalist. Sweet Jesus, some of it would make Donald Trump blush with envy.\n\nNow, here we are in 2020, and once again, we are being told that the only hope we have in this election is to go with the establishment Democrat. And one after another, after another former Democratic candidate is lining up to sell that line to the American people. These include Kamala Harris, who not too long ago said this about Joe Biden.\n\nKamala Harris: I'm going to now direct this at Vice President Biden. I do not believe you are a racist and I agree with you when you commit yourself to the importance of finding common ground. But I also believe and it is personal, I was actually - It was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two United States senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country. And it was not only that but you also worked with them to oppose bussing.\n\nJS: These people also include Beto O'Rourke who said this:\n\nWillie Geist: So is Joe Biden a return to the past:\n\nBeto O'Rourke: He is and that cannot be who we are going forward. We've got to be bigger. We've got to be bolder. We have to set a much higher mark and be relentless in pursuing that.\n\nJS: And the list goes on and on. On Sunday, Hillary Clinton spoke with Fareed Zakaria on CNN. And with no apparent sense of irony, Clinton proudly noted that Joe Biden is running a Clinton 2016 type campaign.\n\nHC: What Joe's victories on Super Tuesday showed is that he is building the kind of coalition that I had basically. It's a broad-based coalition. I finished, you know, most of the work I needed to do for the nomination on Super Tuesday, and then it kind of lingered on. And I think Joe is on track to doing exactly the same thing.\n\nJS: In 2016, Donald Trump was incredibly able to attack Clinton sort of, from the left, going through her disastrous foreign policy record, positions on trade, financial ties, while attacking Washington as corrupt. Joe Biden is going to face this exact line of attack and we are going to hear nonstop about Hunter Biden, Burisma, Ukraine, corruption, nepotism.\n\nDonald J. Trump: That would be a major issue on the campaign. I will bring that up all the time because I don't see any way out. I don't see any way out for them. I don't see how they could answer those questions. Or maybe they can. I hope they can. I'd actually prefer it that they can but I don't believe they'll be able to answer those questions. That was purely corrupt.\n\nJS: The other factor in all of this is that Joe Biden is nowhere near as articulate and sharp as Hillary Clinton. And Biden has his own horrendous record on women's issues and inappropriate actions toward women. In fact, there are a lot of reasons that Biden's campaign is so desperately trying to keep him away from open mics and no one should be pretending like this is not a serious problem. Voters are going to see Joe Biden in what I think can only be called mental decline and they are going to wonder if he should be in charge of the nuclear arsenal. And the fact that Trump is also in clear mental decline, that's not exactly reassuring.\n\nJust listen to what Biden's own current supporters said about him not that long ago as they campaigned for the nomination. Here is Cory Booker:\n\nCory Booker: I think that we are at a tough point right now because there's a lot of people who are concerned about Joe Biden's ability to carry the ball all the way across the end line without fumbling.\n\nJS: And then there was this exchange at a debate with Julian Castro.\n\nJB: They do not have to buy-in.\n\nJulian Castro: You just said that. You just said that two minutes ago. You just said two minutes ago that they would have to buy-in. You said they would have to buy-in.\n\n[Crosstalk.]\n\nJC: Are you forgetting what you said two minutes ago? Are you forgetting already what you said just two minutes ago?\n\nJS: Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan openly said that Joe Biden's mental health was being discussed in Democratic establishment circles.\n\nTim Ryan: It is a concern you're hearing from a lot of people in the country. I'm just saying that it's unclear sometimes when he is articulating positions there's a lack of clarity and I'll leave it at that.\n\nJS: These are Democrats talking about Joe Biden. Overwhelmingly they are Democrats who are now endorsing Biden. Now imagine what Donald Trump is going to do. Pretending like there is not something obviously wrong here, it's just plain stupid.\n\nWell, one of the first progressive political analysts to predict that Hillary Clinton would lose to Donald Trump was Nathan Robinson, the editor in chief of the magazine Current Affairs. Robinson is now predicting that if the Democrats run Joe Biden he too will lose to Donald Trump.\n\nRobinson's latest piece for Current Affairs is Democrats, You Really Do Not Want To Nominate Joe Biden . And Nathan Robinson joins me now. Nathan welcome back to Intercepted.\n\nNathan Robinson: Thanks, nice to be with you.\n\nJS: So sort of just lay out the concept that you begin with in your piece.\n\nNR: Since Super Tuesday, there has been a narrative taking hold and you hear this argument sort of more and more and you notice people starting to say it, Joe Biden's not fantastic but he's the safe choice.\n\nChris Matthews: 53 percent of call Biden safe. Others say he's gonna win. He's the best bet right now against Trump.\n\nNR: His whole pitch is we need to get rid of Donald Trump. That's the priority. So it doesn't matter really whether you like Joe Biden or not. It doesn't really matter whether his record is good or not because there's only one question on the ballot, which is, can he beat Trump and in fact, even his wife, Jill Biden said, well, you may like another candidate more but -\n\nJill Biden: You know, your candidate might be better on, I don't know, health care, than Joe is, but you've got to look at who's gonna win this election. And maybe you have to swallow a little bit and say, OK, I sort of personally like so and so better but your bottom line has to be that we have to beat Trump.\n\nNR: And I think it's a very powerful and persuasive argument. That's why you hear it so much. People are very, very taken in by it. So that's why I think it is important to empathize with it to the extent that you know, you try to understand how it works and why people believe it, because I ultimately think it's such a dangerous and wrong argument. This whole image of him as this real nice, honest guy, kind of crumbles when you start to look at him closely. And in fact, it's often said of Joe Biden that he doesn't do well under scrutiny. And there's a reason for that because Joe Biden survives on his smile. But when you actually start to ask, well, is this guy honest? You know, Joe Biden's whole appeal is he says, you know, character is on the ballot, you say, well, what is his character? You find that the entire thing that is his pitch and his brand doesn't hold up, it collapses, and I think it's gonna collapse, you know, towards November too.\n\nJS: Nathan, explain the history of Joe Biden, and civil rights and Joe Biden and criminal justice issues.\n\nNR: In the 1970s Joe Biden, when he was elected, he said, I'm a liberal on civil liberties, but basically not on anything else. I'm kind of a social conservative, and indeed, one of the Joe Biden was sort of a demagogue on the issue of busing and integration. There was that famous clash with Kamala Harris\n\nKH: Do you agree today that you were wrong to oppose busing in America then? Do you agree?\n\nJB: I did not oppose busing in America. What I opposed is busing ordered by the Department of Education. That's what I opposed.\n\nKH: Well there was a failure of states to integrate -\n\nNR: But what actually happened was Joe Biden realized that white liberal voters were uncomfortable with racial integration. And so he took a very strong stand against federal efforts to integrate the school system.\n\nJB: There are those of we social planners who think somehow that if we just subrogate man's individual characteristics and traits by making sure that presently a heterogeneous society becomes a totally homogeneous society, that somehow we are going to solve our social ills. And quite to the contrary, I think the concept of busing which implicit in that concept is the question you just asked or the statement within the question you just ask that we are going to integrate people so that they all have the same access and they learn to grow up with one another and all the rest is a rejection of the whole movement of black pride is a rejection of the entire black awareness concept where black is beautiful. Black culture should be studied, and a cultural awareness of the importance of their own identity, their own individuality. And I think that's a healthy, solid proposal.\n\nNR: It was basically his attempt to pander to the racists and in fact, he partnered with people like Strom Thurmond and Jesse Helms who were his close friends and collaborators and who he really kind of excused the racism of, as you say, the criminal justice thing, which, you know, he partnered with Strom Thurmond on some of the, you know, tough on crime is an understatement.\n\nJB: Tens of thousands of them born out of wedlock, without parents, without supervision, without any structure, without any conscience developing because they literally have not been socialized. They literally have not had an opportunity. We should focus on them now. If we don't, they will or a portion of them will become the predators 15 years from now. And Madam President, we have predators on our streets that society has, in fact, in part because of neglect created. They are beyond the pale many of those people.\n\nThere's 100,000 real bad apples out there. 100,000 of them warrant exceptionally, exceptionally tough treatment.\n\nNR: I mean, Joe Biden really was one of the key people in turning the Democrats into this tough on crime party.\n\nJB: And we are looking forward, as Pat said, as Senator Leahy said to joining hands with the Republicans because I think 90 percent of what we're proposing in this major democratic initiative could be a Republican initiative. It should be a bipartisan initiative. Let me get down here a compendium of the things that are in the bill. It provides 53 death penalty offenses, weak as can be, you know. We do everything but hang people for jaywalking in this bill. That's weak stuff.\n\nNR: And in fact, there's been good reporting in The Intercept about the way that he pushed Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush to be harsher on crime.\n\nJB: In a nutshell, the president's plan doesn't include enough police officers to catch the violent thugs, not enough prosecutors to convict them, not enough judges to sentence them and not enough prison cells to put them away for a long time.\n\nNR: I mean, he was really on the hard right of the Democratic Party when it came to criminal punishment issues.\n\nJS: I think it's worth just pausing for a moment to talk about Joe Biden's relationship with Strom Thurmond. And let's be clear here, Strom Thurmond is one of the most vile racists ever to serve in the United States Congress, and there are a lot of them. But Strom Thurmond is one of the absolute worst and in 1988, according to Joe Biden, he received strong Thurman's blessing for his presidential campaign. And I'm quoting from Joe Biden here, Joe Biden said, \"Strom told me he said, Joe, if there has to be a Democrat as President, I hope it won't happen. It might as well be you.\" Talk about Joe Biden's relationship with this notorious white supremacist segregationist senator, Strom Thurmond.\n\nNR: Well, you know, at Strom Thurmond's funeral, it was noted in the press that there weren't many people from the liberal wing of American politics at that funeral, which was understandable, but there was one person who was Joe Biden.\n\nJB: James Strom Thurmond, Fritzy was one complex guy.\n\nNR: Who gave a warm eulogy for the man who had consistently been the Senate's sort of leading opponent of civil rights. What Biden did was not only collaborate with Thurmond on legislation that had really terrible consequences for African Americans in the United States and Biden always said, \"Oh, well, I disagreed with them, but I got along with them.\"\n\nJB: I came to the United States Senate, a 29-year-old fellow out of the civil rights movement, a public defender, and turns out one of my closest friends, ends up being Strom Thurmond. He said \"Joe, if there has to be a Democratic president, and I hope it won't happen. He said it might as well be you.\" And after I dropped out of the race, he came and he said, don't worry about it. He said you got a good 30 years left to try.\n\nNR: But the real point is that what he did was he misstated who these men were and what they stood for. And he portrayed them as nice men when they're actually men who were really strongly invested their whole lives in maintaining the racial hierarchy of the United States.\n\nJS: In this election year, one of the I think great motivators of people who want Donald Trump out of office and there are many of them is the issue of women's reproductive health. Of course, the Supreme Court has before it now a case that could dramatically impact the status of Roe vs. Wade and access to a safe and healthy processes for getting, obtaining an abortion. Let's go back and start with Joe Biden's position on Roe vs. Wade. And what he said about it, Nathan.\n\nNR: Biden said openly in the 1970s that he had, he was opposed to Roe vs. Wade, didn't think a woman had the sole right to say what happened to her body. He voted in the 1980s to let states overturn Roe vs. Wade. And even in 2006, he was describing himself -\n\nJB: I do not view abortion as a choice and a right. I think it's always a tragedy. You see, I'm a little bit of an odd man out in my party. I do not vote for funding for abortion. I voted against partial birth abortion, to limit it and I vote for no restrictions on a woman's right to be able to have an abortion under Roe v. Wade.\n\nNR: He had to be pressured for his entire career to support the basics of women's reproductive rights.\n\nJS: You know, the topic that has come up more often than any others in this campaign has been the fact that Joe Biden not only voted for the war in Iraq, but when he was chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in late 2002, as the war in Iraq was being debated, he actively aided and abetted the case and the drive for war, for an invasion and occupation of Iraq in two primary ways. One, he promoted the lie that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.\n\nJB: Saddam Hussein's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction, in my view is one, of those clear dangers, even if the right response to his pursuit is not so crystal clear. One thing is clear. These weapons must be dislodged from Saddam Hussein or Saddam Hussein must be dislodged from power. I am of the school that suggests that the President need not - when this, if this amendment, if the underlying amendment passes - have to show there's an imminent threat. He is enforcing a peace agreement in effect.\n\nContrary to what some in my party might think, Iraq was a problem that had to be dealt with sooner rather than later.\n\nI voted to go into Iraq, and I'd vote to do it again.\n\nJS: And then, on the other hand, he prevented any dissenting, true dissenting voices from appearing before the Senate in what was advertised as a debate about what the United States should do in Iraq. But there's a range of issues that are very concerning about Joe Biden in foreign policy but let's start with Iraq, Nathan.\n\nNR: Joe Biden years before was talking about the possible need for the United States to go in alone in removing Saddam Hussein.\n\nJB: That the only way, the only way we're going to get rid of Saddam Hussein is we're going to end up having to start it alone. Start it alone and it's going to require guys like you in uniform to be back on foot, in the desert taking Saddam down. You know it and I know it.\n\nNR: One of the things that Joe Biden does now that is so outrageous is distort the record. He was one of the most powerful and useful Democratic allies that lent this sort of bipartisan imprimatur to this foreign policy catastrophe. And then he says, you know, he portrayed himself and he was called out by fact-checkers for this as someone who had opposed the war from the moment it started.\n\nJB: I did make a bad judgment trusting the president saying he was only doing this to get inspectors in and get the U.N. to agree to put inspectors in from the moment shock and awe started, from that moment, I was opposed to the effort and I was outspoken.\n\nJS: It's interesting, too, because Joe Biden very clearly wants to run on the fact that for eight years, he was Barack Obama's Vice President. But if he wants to sort of use that as one of his like, you know, trump cards, so to speak in this election, we should also then have to talk about the Biden-Obama record on war. And the fact is that it was under Obama and Biden that the Saudi genocidal war in Yemen began. It was when the Joint Special Operations Command of the military and the CIA, were let off the leash to start ratcheting up drone strikes around the world. It was under the Obama-Biden administration that they ran an extrajudicial secret court system where people would be tried, convicted, sentenced to death in a secretive process, including American citizens for death by drone strike with no oversight whatsoever, and yet, we don't hear questions about that Nathan at all in the debates about Joe Biden and Saudi Arabia, Joe Biden and drone strikes, Joe Biden and assassinating U.S. citizens who had not actually been charged with crimes of terrorism.\n\nNR: Yeah, one of the reasons that it's possible for Joe Biden to speak proudly of his record on foreign policy serving under Obama is that for many liberals and Democrats, they've failed to interrogate Obama's foreign policy. It's the same with immigration, right, where it's something that if we confront it, honestly, we realize that actually having been involved in the Obama administration's policies on immigration is something that you should have to be held to account for. Because it's so wrong, because advocates, people that actually understood the issue and were acquainted with its human costs and consequences were saying this at the time. It's just that no one was listening to them.\n\nJS: You know, Joe Biden, for as much as he has said throughout his career that you know, he's a liberal on civil liberties, he has bragged a number of times that the USA Patriot Act which only one U.S. Senator voted against, that was Russ Feingold of Wisconsin, but that the USA Patriot Act was rooted in, based on a bill that Biden himself had written before 9/11 and Biden said that the former Attorney General under George W. Bush, John Ashcroft, that he told Joe Biden that the Patriot Act \"Joe, I'm introducing the act basically as you wrote it in 1994.\" Explain what we are talking about here when you have Bush's Attorney General John Ashcroft crediting Biden with being the legislative inspiration for the Patriot Act.\n\nNR: I mean, it's a crazy story, really, but Biden, yeah, has said, repeatedly, I wrote the Patriot Act, basically, you know, I tried to push through the Patriot Act in the mid-90s, as part of the war on drugs because I wanted to escalate. And I think in the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing, and you know, he wanted to increase the government's power to wiretap, reduce accountability for law enforcement, just give the state much greater unaccountable surveillance powers. That was something Joe Biden had been pushing for a long time. It's quite strange that the Patriot Act which is, you know, one of the most dangerous expanses of government power in our time is something that instead of seeing it as a major mistake he sees as a point of pride on his resume.\n\nJS: So Nathan in Michigan, which is holding its primary today, Bernie Sanders has been really hammering away on two very large themes there. What is the difference between Sanders' position and Biden's position on trade and on social security?\n\nNR: Their positions couldn't really be further apart. I mean, Joe Biden, when Ronald Reagan came into power, said, you know, Ronald Reagan was sort of more in tune with the budgetary priorities of a guy like Biden, because he's always been a deficit hawk, you know, guy talking about the urgent need to cut spending. And that has led him to say consistently that he believes, you know, everything should be on the table.\n\nJB: When I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant social security as well. I meant Medicare and Medicaid. I meant veterans but I meant every single solitary thing in the government. And I not only tried it once, I tried it twice. I tried it a third time. And I tried it a fourth time.\n\nI tried with Senator Grassley back in the 80s to freeze all government spending, including social security, including everything.\n\nSocial Security is not the hard one to solve. Medicare, that is the gorilla in the room, and you've got to put all of it on the table, everything, everything you've got to.\n\nNR: I mean, they've been direct clashes between Sanders and the Obama administration and Biden over social security. And trade is quite similar, you know, Biden voted for NAFTA and Bernie has always made an issue of opposing free trade agreements because of job loss, especially in places like the Midwest. And the important point to note there, of course, is that one of Trump's signature campaign issues, it's one of the things he hammered over and over and over against Hillary Clinton and we can anticipate that he will do the same thing if he runs against Joe Biden.\n\nJS: Recently, Joe Biden's account tweeted if we give Donald Trump four more years in the White House, our planet may never recover. I want to ask you about Biden and the climate crisis. His campaign, Joe Biden's is just packed to the gills with fossil fuel executives and others. His climate advisor is a former board member of natural gas company Cheniere Energy. One of Biden's fundraisers co-founded another natural gas company. You have the pro-Biden super PAC with gas lobbyists on its board. National campaign co-chair Cedric Richmond, according to your piece has \"one of the most pro-industry voting records on fossil fuel issues among all congressional Democrats.\" Talk about Biden and climate.\n\nNR: So we could ask, you know, how likely is he to do anything right when he's surrounded by all these people whose industries basically their continued existence is predicated on continuing to catastrophically harm the climate? And so it's very difficult when all of those people are working for you, and they're your friends, and they're around you, for you to do what is necessary which is going to involve taking on and challenging those industries. So I mean, if you remember the exchanges that he's had with voters, where he says, go vote for someone else, where he's had a couple of those.\n\nUnidentified person: But what are we gonna do about climate change? Now, you say you're against pipelines but then you want to replace these gas lines. That's not gonna work. We got to stop building and replacing pipelines.\n\nJB: Go vote for someone else.\n\nUnidentified person: Alright, thank you so much.\n\nJB: If you're not going to vote for me in the primary -\n\nUnidentified person: I'm going to vote for you in the general -\n\nNR: Both of those videos are him clashing with people who are trying to bring up environmental concerns with him. They're trying to bring up pipelines and fracking. And he says to them, he says to those voters, I'm not even gonna try. This is not, I'm not even to try to persuade you. I basically exclude you from the people that I think of myself as needing to win over.\n\nJS: You know, the huge - it's not just an elephant in the room. It's like, you know, a herd of elephants in the room is what is going on with Joe Biden's brain.\n\nJB: I want to be clear, I'm not going nuts. I'm not sure whether it's in medical school or where the hell I spoke.\n\nOut of a trillion six hundred billion worth, a trillion four hundred billion worth, out of a billion, four hundred million. Excuse me, a trillion four hundred billion dollars. It's hard to even say it. It's so much.\n\nI took on Putin in terms of Iraq. I mean, excuse me in terms of what was going on in Ukraine.\n\nI'm among many qualified people on the best-qualified people, person for this job.\n\nWe can do it and it's going to take billions of dollars to do it. And we can afford to do it. We can afford it - We can't afford not to do it.\n\nHe's saying that it was the president, my boss, it was his fault.\n\nDonald Trump does pose an existential threat to this - It's not hypothetical.\n\nThis is my little sister Valerie and I'm Jill's husband. Oh, no, Valerie you switched on me. This is my wife. This is my sister. They switched on me.\n\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident. All men and women are created by oh, you know the, you know the thing.\n\nMy name is Joe Biden. I'm a Democratic candidate for the United States Senate. Look me over. If you like what you see, help out. If not vote for the other Biden, give me a look though, OK.\n\nJS: You know, I mean, people say, oh, this is cruel, or they try to say, oh, he does that because he has a stutter. No, no, no, no, no, no. Yeah, Joe Biden has always been somewhat of a calamity when it comes to off the cuff speaking. But a stutter issue doesn't make you lie about being arrested in apartheid South Africa, a stutter issue doesn't make you lie about participating in sit-ins. A stutter issue doesn't make you lie about your position on the Iraq war. We need to be clear here. Joe Biden is a borderline pathological liar who also seems to at times not realize who he is, what he's running for, or the powers of the presidency. I'm sorry, we have to talk about this.\n\nWe have a totally unstable fascist, narcissistic, loony in the White House right now. And we're going to run against him someone who doesn't seem to know what room he's in, who is his sister, and who is his wife, the fact that he can't name people to the U.S. Senate. I mean, this is absolutely a valid issue to talk about, and I don't care how much trolling I get for talking about it. This is frightening that this is the man that the Democratic establishment thinks is going to be the solution to Donald Trump.\n\nNR: Yeah, so I think there are two things here. The first thing is the pathological lying. I mean we really do need to remember the fact it is not a small issue that Joe Biden's first presidential campaign in 1988 ended in disaster because he turned out to be a pathological liar.\n\nNewscaster: Democratic presidential candidate Joseph Biden today faces a controversy. Three weeks ago at a debate at the Iowa State Fair, he used phrases identical to those delivered by British Labour Party leader Neil Kinnock.\n\nNewscaster: Biden seemed to be claiming Kinnock's vision and life as his own.\n\nJB: My ancestors who worked in the coal mines in northeast Pennsylvania would come up after 12 hours and play football.\n\nNeil Kinnock: Eight hours underground, and then come up and play football.\n\nJB: It's because they didn't have a platform upon which to stand.\n\nNK: There was no platform upon which they could stand.\n\nNewscaster: The problem here is that Senator Biden told his audience he just been thinking about these things, and he failed to give any credit at all to his famous British speechwriter.\n\nJB: I should have said to paraphrase Neil Kinnock. It's the only time I didn't. In all the times I've used it.\n\nNewscaster: But CBS News found a tape of a second instance.\n\nNewscaster: Biden had appropriated a famous litany from the late Robert Kennedy about what the gross national product cannot measure.\n\nJB: It cannot measure the health of our children.\n\nRobert Kennedy: The health of our children.\n\nJB: The quality of our education.\n\nRK: The quality of their education.\n\nJB: The joy of their play.\n\nRK: Or the joy of their play.\n\nNewscaster: Joseph Biden admitted today that he committed plagiarism when he was in law school. He said it was a mistake, but that it was unintentional.\n\nNewscaster: He quoted five pages of someone else's work without proper citation.\n\nJB: I've done some dumb things and I'll do dumb things again.\n\nNewscaster: Senator Joseph Biden may have more explaining to do.\n\nJB: Well, I went to law school on a full academic scholarship. The only one in my class to have a full academic scholarship, went back to law school, and in fact, ended up in the top half of my class. I was the outstanding student in the political science department at the end of my year. I graduated with three degrees from undergraduate school and 165 credits, only needed 123 credits.\n\nNewscaster: Biden now concedes he did not graduate in the top half of his law school class, that he does not have three degrees from college, and that he was not named outstanding political science student in college.\n\nNewscaster: Newsweek says Biden actually went to school on a half scholarship ended up near the bottom of his class and won only one degree, not three.\n\nNR: And when all of this came out what a faker and a plagiarist he was, he had to leave the race because it was so embarrassing, and he is doing this even now. And Donald Trump is going to point it out. And this is one of the things I emphasize over and over and over in the piece is, you know, a lot of people aren't gonna be persuaded by a lot of the stuff that you and I talked about, but if all you care about is electability, this is a guy who has massive liabilities for having said all these untrue things that are all going to be in ads, and that Donald Trump is going to point out every single one of them and he's already doing it. So the lies issue should already disqualify him.\n\nBut the second thing as you say is the mental fitness issue. Now, you know, as you say, you know, we don't want to diagnose him with anything, but go and look at all of the clips of him speaking in recent years, think about this going up against Donald Trump. What Democrats often don't appreciate is that Donald Trump is such a skilled and formidable bully. He's so good at finding people's weak spots, and just mercilessly exposing them and talking about them over and over and over. So all this stuff in his record, Donald Trump's going to talk about it. He's going to talk about the criminal punishment stuff. He's already running criminal justice reform ads talking about, you know, how he's been better for black people than Democrats.\n\nHe's gonna talk about all the mental stuff. There are clips of Donald Trump where he's talking about, oh, well, every time I watch Joe Biden, I'm just so curious as to what he's gonna say next, and how wrong it's gonna be and I feel so bad for poor Joe because he doesn't even seem to understand where he is or what office he's running for. And it's going to be very difficult to respond to that because it's correct, because it is true that Joe Biden seems incredibly unreliable and the sort of guy who was really not in a fit state to run for any office, let alone president.\n\nJS: Finally, Nathan, I want to ask you because you back in 2016, you said very early on that Hillary Clinton was going to lose to Donald Trump and what we have seen and we certainly see it at now in Hillary's hagiography on Hulu is this blaming of Bernie Sanders, blaming of the left, blaming of Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate for Hillary's loss in the 2016 election.\n\nHillary Clinton: Honestly, Bernie just drove me crazy. He was in Congress for years, years. He had one senator support him, nobody likes him. Nobody wants to work with him. He got nothing done. He was a career politician. He did not work till he was like 41 and then he got elected to something. It was all just baloney. And I feel so bad that you know, everybody got sucked into it.\n\nJS: Do you think that same scenario is going to play out if Joe Biden is the nominee runs against Donald Trump and loses? Is it going to all be, well, it's going to be Bernie Sanders and the left's fault that this happened?\n\nNR: Yeah, you know, it's funny after 2016, you might have thought some lessons would have been learned. I mean, we, you know, people like me and Michael Moore, were calling it out at the time and we were saying, you're going to lose, you don't understand what Trump's appeal is. And you don't understand, like, how effective his attacks on the Democratic establishment are. Hillary Clinton lost. And there was no introspection. In fact, if anything, they're running this kind of almost parody of the same playbook, right? Now you have Joe Biden, the guy who, if anything embodies even more of the failures of the Democratic Party of the past 40 years, even more lies, even more pathologically, and so you're gonna make it even worse.\n\nI mean, I compare Joe Biden to Don Quixote because I was reading Don Quixote the other day.  And a guy pointed out he said, \"That's a very topical book\" and I said, \"Why is it topical?\" He said, well, because Don Quixote is the guy who lives in a fantasy of the past and doesn't understand that the world has changed and when he fights against the windmills thinking their giants and then you know, gets, you know, lifted up by the windmills, he doesn't then think, oh, I was wrong these are actually windmills. He just comes up with an explanation of how oh, no, they were still actually giants, but it must have been a wizard that turned them into it,\" right?\n\nYou know, so that's what the Democratic Party are doing instead of looking at 2016 and introspecting, and saying, \"Oh, this is why we got it wrong. We need to fix these very severe problems.\" It's, oh, well, you know, Putin put Trump in the White House. So we can do the same thing again, and it's not our fault. We don't have to adapt. We don't have to change. And I think that ultimately, that's going to be a catastrophe for the Democratic Party. We've been saying over and over, you need to run someone like Bernie Sanders, someone who has an authentic populist message, someone who has something that can inspire people, people can get behind and who can counter a lot of Donald Trump's criticisms of the Democratic Party because they share those criticisms.\n\nIt's very difficult to predict what would happen with the Biden nomination mainly because of the virus, like I don't know how the virus is going to throw this kind of X-factor into this election. But if it were not for that, it would be very, very clear that running this like incoherent lying, totally uninspiring, Democratic conman is not a pragmatic electoral strategy. But the crazy, crazy thing is that it is being presented as the electable option, the pragmatic and sound and sensible choice and I just feel and you probably feel, I just feel crazy every day because I watch them stumbling towards what seems like a nightmare, and I'm really dreading watching Joe Biden for months go up against this sort of bulldozer Donald Trump, but if that's the choice they make, it's the choice they make.\n\nJS: You've checked out the record of Joe Biden and if you like it help out and if not vote for the other Biden.\n\nNR: Oh my gosh, there's so many clips.\n\nJS: We're gonna leave it there though. Nathan Robinson, thank you so much for being with us.\n\nNR: Thanks, Jeremy. Always a pleasure.\n\nJS: Nathan Robinson is editor in chief of Current Affairs. His latest piece is Democrats, You Really Do Not Want To Nominate Joe Biden. His latest book is \"Why You Should be a Socialist.\"\n\n[Music interlude.]\n\nJS: When it comes to the major questions of U.S. economic, social, political and foreign policy, Bernie Sanders has been an outsider for his entire career in politics. He has always caucused with the Democrats in the House and Senate, but he has made clear that he distinguishes himself from the capital P party. People like to focus on the fact that Sanders calls himself a Democratic Socialist, but the designation next to his name is an I for independent. That's how most people in this country view themselves.\n\nYes, Bernie Sanders is running for the Democratic nomination for president. And the establishment in both 2016 and 2020 have reacted to him like a foreign virus that has invaded its body.\n\nJB: And if the Democrats want a nominee who's a Democrat, a life-long Democrat, a proud Democrat, an Obama-Biden Democrat, join us.\n\nJS: This refrain from Joe Biden which gets applause at Democratic Party rallies is really an embarrassing own-goal on his part when we look toward a general election. What makes Sanders so appealing to millions of voters in this country is that he is not just a partisan lemming, that he challenges established orthodoxy. Sanders clearly shares more in common with the Democratic Party than he does with the Republicans and in our current system, which is overwhelmingly controlled by billionaires and corporations and special interests, running for the Democratic nomination is the most responsible and logical move for Bernie Sanders and for the movements that are powering his run for president.\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez: I want to talk a little bit because in 1984 Reverend Jackson delivered a speech. Now listen to this, this was his analysis back then in 1984 that \"Reagan won not by genius, he won while we were asleep. He won by the margin of despair. He won by the fracture of our coalition, by the margin of racial division. He won by default. Does that sound familiar, Michigan?\n\nJS: When Joe Biden goes into his stump refrain celebrating the partisan identity of being a corporate Democrat, how does that sound to workers who were harmed by the Democrats trade policies or criminal justice policies or war policies? People are not clamoring for a world run by partisan Democratic operatives. Many are clamoring for an end to Donald Trump and the election of a serious administration that actually prioritizes changing people's lives and the world for the better. And whether we like it or not, there are an enormous number of voters in this country who will be deciding between the Democratic nominee and Donald Trump without any real consideration whatsoever of what party they technically represent. The issue will be: Who is better for me and my family?\n\nJB: During the Obama-Biden administration, as the vice president of the United States, I worked with a man who in fact, we worked very hard. President turned to me and said Joe, get our combat troops out of Iraq.\n\nJS: Joe Biden's partisan pandering and mentioning constantly his links to Obama, alongside the skewed media coverage and massive amounts of money being spent to attack Sanders, may well be enough to win Joe Biden the Democratic nomination, but it's a dangerous message to run on in the general election, particularly against Donald Trump. Let's be honest, who has been the most partisan Democrat is a terrible platform if you want to get the most votes in places like Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania.\n\nBernie Sanders: If we are going to defeat Trump in Michigan, in Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, it will be very hard for a candidate who voted for these disastrous trade agreements.\n\nJS: In Michigan , Bernie Sanders stepped up his on the ground organizing efforts in the month leading up to the primary. Many people view it as a kind of make or break moment in this campaign for Bernie Sanders. They opened field offices in Grand Rapids, Ann Arbor, Dearborn, Flint, Detroit. Joe Biden, on the other hand, is largely running what you might call a virtual campaign and he is severely limiting his public appearances.\n\nJB: The Bernie bros are here, let them go. Folks.\n\nThat's what's wrong, that's what's wrong with American politics.\n\nJS: Ahead of Tuesday's primaries, Bernie Sanders spent the weekend in Michigan, holding rallies in Detroit, Flint, Grand Rapids, Ann Arbor, and Dearborn.\n\nBS: You know, I am, I get inspired. Sometimes people say Bernie, you're 33 years of age. How do you keep going? And I get inspired because I talk to groups like this. I look around this room. I see people coming from so many different backgrounds. It is beautiful. This is what America looks like at its best.\n\nJS: Joe Biden has done almost nothing to get out the vote other than I guess, being Joe Biden. Now maybe that along with the massive spending and free publicity in the corporate media is going to be enough to win a primary, but it doesn't do much to beat Donald Trump and win over non-Democrats.\n\nWhat's remarkable is that - even with the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on attacking Bernie Sanders, the unrestrained Super PACS going after him, even with the entire Hillary Clinton apparatus smearing Sanders for 5 years and now on-demand on HULU, even with the Wall Street and corporate power structures aligned against him - Sanders is winning millions of votes in the Democratic Party's primary. And he is, as of this moment, within striking range of Joe Biden. Who was, for eight years, the vice president of an administration that was extremely popular with Democratic voters and the party establishment and which also is the number one object of scorn in the world of Trump supporters.\n\nDJT: Now sleepy Joe would say the unemployment rate in the great state of Ohio. No, no, you're in South Carolina. Joe, Joe, you're in South - They come up. You ever see the guy with the notes? No, no, no, it's South Carolina. It's not Ohio. OK.\n\nJS: What we are really seeing is a candidate in Joe Biden, whose very long record represents so much of what is wrong about the Democratic Party, fighting off a very serious challenge from an insurgent movement that is backing a candidate who has stood against the bipartisan consensus on some of the most vital issues to our country and our world. But that is not the story being told in corporate media and it's certainly isn't the story being told by the Biden campaign.\n\nRachel Maddow: What is going wrong with your campaign when it comes to competing in the South and competing specifically for black voters?\n\nBS: Well, let me just give you the other side of the story is that in California, if my memory is correct, we received 39 percent of the votes of people of color which were Latinos, Asian Americans, and African Americans.\n\nJS: The dominant corporate and partisan narrative pretends that this is just a fair fight and the voters are deciding the fate of this primary. It erases the entire role of dark money. It erases the powerful corporate interests and backroom maneuvering.\n\nBS: And there's not been a campaign I think that has been having to deal with the kind of venom we're seeing from some in the corporate media. This campaign has been compared to the coronavirus on television. We have been described as the Nazi army marching across France, etcetera, etcetera.\n\nJS: Much of the coverage of this primary campaign erases the existence of the smear machinery against Bernie Sanders and dismisses the avalanche of hostile corporate media coverage of his campaign and just says oh, this is just about the voters. At the same time, this same apparatus seeks to erase the decades of atrocious policies and positions and statements from Joe Biden.\n\nJohn Harwood: Bobby Rush, member of Congress said the other day, I'm ashamed that I voted for the '94 crime bill. You ashamed of that bill?\n\nJB: Not at all. In fact, I drafted the bill, if you remember.\n\nJH: I know that.\n\nJS: While Biden's campaign wants to focus on the risk of nominating Bernie Sanders to take on Donald Trump, the social and political movements backing Sanders put it differently: What are the risks to the country and planet if we do not nominate Sanders to defeat Donald Trump?\n\nMichael Moore: If we don't fix climate change, like now, we don't have four years. We're done. We're done. We're done. And so what they love about Bernie is that he's fighting for their future and he will not relent. They know he can't be bought, he will not give in. And it's not his future he's fighting for it. He won't be around to see what's going to happen to this planet.\n\nJS: As the media obsession with snake emojis and so-called Bernie Bros continues to dominate large sectors of the media and political discourse on cable news and social media, it's important to note that Bernie Sanders has won the endorsements of labor unions, environmental groups, nurses, teachers and of a very diverse cross-section of voters in this country.\n\nYou may not have seen it on the news but a group of more than 100 Black academics , scholars and writers released a statement endorsing Bernie Sanders on the eve of the South Carolina Primary. That letter reads in part, \"the powerful policy changes he has outlined, if elected, would make the most far-reaching and positive impact on the lives and condition of Black people, and all people in the United States.\" On Monday, the Working Families Party endorsed Sanders, as did civil rights icon Jesse Jackson on Sunday.\n\nJesse Jackson: I stand with Bernie Sanders today because he stood with me. I stand with him because he's never lost his taste for justice for the people. I stand with him because he stands with you.\n\nJS: This weekend, a multi-generational, multi-racial coalition of feminists released a statement making the case for supporting Bernie Sanders. It is titled, \" Rising for a Global Feminist Future with the Movement to Elect Bernie Sanders .\" Joining me now are two of the authors of this statement. Aja Monet is a Brooklyn-born Cuban-Jamaican poet and activist. Her latest book is called \"My Mother Was a Freedom Fighter.\" And, we are joined by Filmmaker, author, and organizer Astra Taylor. After organizing with the Occupy Wall Street movement in 2011, Taylor co-founded the Debt Collective , an organization that has developed some very effective tools to help people dispute and challenge their debt. Her latest book is \"Democracy May Not Exist, but We'll Miss It When It's Gone.\" Aja Monet, Astra Taylor, I want to welcome both of you back to Intercepted.\n\nAstra Taylor: Thanks for having me.\n\nAja Monet: Thank you, glad to be here.\n\nJS: Aja, I want to start with you, just give an overview of the statement that you all released with the title \"Rising for a Global Feminist Future with the Movement to Elect Bernie Sanders.\" Explain what the statement is about how it came to be and why you're behind it.\n\nAM: We're seeing that a lot of the policies that Bernie Sanders is putting forth are policies that address the issues that many of us have been fighting for a very long time. Being in this moment, we see that there has been this divisiveness that has happened between, \"progressive people.\" And when that happened, there was a lot of conversation around the Bernie bros and what Bernie and the Bernie Sanders campaign means for the broader conversation around patriarchy and feminism and where do women stand and what we saw from someone as amazing as Linda Sarsour and Barbara Smith and Keeanga Taylor and Nina Turner and I mean, the list goes on and on that there have been many women who have been critical to moving and developing and pushing the campaign for the political revolution that we currently know to be behind Bernie Sanders. And in that there has been an I believe, an attempt from the media to kind of erase the voices of women and particularly women of color who have been behind that movement.\n\nAnd so standing in solidarity with Linda and all these other incredible women, I had a conversation with Eve Ensler and I knew Naomi Klein was going through the same sort of frustration. And when we had this discussion, I was like, let's all get on a call to talk about how we could actually build a demonstration of solidarity. So folks can really see that this is not just a campaign for white male, poor, middle-class folks, but that it's actually a movement that's going to transform drastically the lives for women and women of color, poor women and women of color across the country, but also the globe. And so that's how this all came to be. In that conversation, we started thinking about and strategizing what can we do to shift the narrative? What can we do to come together? And this statement was what came of that.\n\nJS: Astra, in the statement, you're calling it a rising for a global feminist future with the movement to elect Bernie Sanders. Take some of that apart and explain what all of you are talking about.\n\nAT: This isn't about putting all of our hope in one person. This is about the fact that there is a broader movement and alliance forming that has a feminist agenda and seeing Sanders and a potential Sanders presidency as a crucial part of that. I mean, the other word that's in there is global, that this isn't just about women in the United States of America, that a Sanders presidency would improve the global situation. And we can think about that in terms of his foreign policy. He's the most anti-war candidate in terms of his climate justice policy, global warming is a global issue. You know, one thing we're trying to get out there, and I think it's so important for all of us, who are feminists to do this is to say these are feminist issues. Global warming is a feminist issue. You know, healthcare is a feminist issue, war is an intersectional feminist issue because people are disabled by war, right, black and brown people are disproportionately maimed and killed by war. These are all feminist issues. And that's the kind of deep intersectionality that this movement is about.\n\nAnd I think, at this moment, we have to work on articulating that. I think one of the powerful things about the Sanders campaign is that, you know, it talks in the language of universality, Medicare for All, free college for all, that's great, and powerful. But there's also a very, very explicit feminist case for these policies that we can lift up at this moment when we're talking about patriarchy and discrimination against women. So you know, Medicare for All, what does that do if you're a woman? If you're facing sexism in the workplace, and you have universal health care, you can tell your boss to eat it, right? If you are facing domestic abuse in the home, but you're dependent on your husband's employer-provided health care, you can tell him that, you know, you don't want to be in a relationship anymore because you're not going to be worried about the fact that you're going to not be able to access the medical care you need. There's a racial justice, gender justice component to all of these universal policies that are really critical. And I think we need to work extra hard to articulate those right now and this letter as part of that in my mind.\n\nJS: Aja, you know, I feel like we're all being gaslit by big corporate media institutions, by the elite of the Democratic Party, this narrative that oh, you know, Joe Biden, now backed by Black America is just trouncing Bernie Sanders.\n\nCNN: Just how important the African American vote is, now that Joe Biden has succeeded so tremendously with the African American vote in South Carolina,\n\nJoy Reid: Black voters said, you know what, that's nice. You want to revolution? The answer? No.\n\nKaren Finney: So everybody knows that Obama is an important factor in terms of the Black vote. But Biden can own that legacy in a way that Sanders just can't.\n\nJS: That is really kind of the dominant narrative that is being pushed right now. And I'm curious how you've been watching and seeing the emergence of this as the big line about Bernie Sanders.\n\nAM: Well, I think black America is not a monolith. You know, like people talk about black people just like they talk about women, just like they talk about Latinos, every demographic people like to paint a broad brush as if everybody has been in agreement and going in one direction for forever. And that's just not the case. I think another conversation that gets left out in terms of talking about the black vote is voter suppression. People are not talking about the ways in which black people have been kept from the polls and not just black people, poor people. I don't think it's just black people when people bring up the black vote, it's ironic they don't bring up the white vote. They don't bring up white women's vote. We're not talking about how many white women voted for Trump. No one's talking about how many white women didn't show up in all different ways politically in the past several election cycles.\n\nThere's a narrative that people are pushing in the media, it's a divisive tactic. It's making the black community actually have more arguments and more internal conflict within themselves than they really need to be when in actuality, the campaign for Bernie Sanders the movement for Bernie Sanders, is actually a movement that will drastically shift the conditions for all black people, rich, poor middle class. We have so many ways that we can illustrate and break down every single policy and demonstrate what the benefits are.\n\nAnd no one's talking about the fact that Biden has not done any work. Biden is leaning on his relationship to Obama, as if that's a demonstration of his values. And as if that makes him an example, a leading light and example of why he can lead the country now. And so it's like, I have my one black friend that he's just trolling around everywhere. That's actually quite deceptive, and making the community have really difficult conversations about what do we stand for? And how do we show up?\n\nJS: You know, Astra, on that point, 53 percent of white women voted for Donald Trump. Democrats say, oh, Bernie Sanders is not going to be able to win suburban white women. And that is now becoming a talking point that Joe Biden is going to be able to win, you know, suburban women.\n\nAT: And it might be true. When Aja was saying black voters aren't a monolith, women voters aren't a monolith. It's absolutely true. We are in a moment of reckoning for the Sanders campaign. I mean, I think what it's done is absolutely remarkable. I mean, we have a Democratic socialist who has come this far, who's taking on the establishment, the establishment is a real thing, who is taking on corporate interest, incredibly powerful, deep-pocketed interests. And so the fact that this constituency has been built, he's gotten this far, that he's neck and neck in terms of delegates with Biden, I'm actually astonished in a way but we are in a moment where we need more voters. We need to build the movement.\n\nAnd so I'm thinking about this conversation in terms of the strategy moving forward. How do we reach some people who are entertaining the prospect of voting for Biden? I have my criticisms, deep criticisms of going in that direction. But right now, we have to build the base and get those people and so I think emphasizing things like that Sanders's policies are fundamentally about care, right, about building a society where people are supported to do the care work. They're about giving women and poor people and black people more power. I think we do have to figure out how to make the case that this is a program that will work for those voters who, you know, are going in a direction we don't want them to right now. That's the challenge we have to face in this moment.\n\nJS: Aja, what do you see as the biggest risks of a Biden versus Trump general election?\n\nAM: He's not going to win. I don't think people really understand how divided we are right now. [Sighs.]  It's just at this point, I think I'm really depressed and very frustrated by this moment because it seems to me that the wealthy, the elite, the corporate interests are all unified on one front. And when it comes to the oppressed, when it comes to poor people, everybody's just don't got nothing to say. Nobody really wants to take a stand. And so what we're seeing right now is that I am exhibiting and I am trying to stay in the fight and I'm trying to continue every day to keep hope when we continually see the establishment steal from the people, steal the people's voice, steal the people's well being, steal the people's sense of self and identity in this country. I mean, it's just, it's discouraging.\n\nAnd I think Biden is an example of a time that I don't want to return to, you know. I want our future generation to be able to look back and say, \"Wow, they really fought for us, and they made sure that we had the basic human decency in this country.\" And Biden's not concerned with that. He doesn't want people to have universal health care. He doesn't care about the fact that the criminal legal system has demonized young black and brown people on the streets, and enabled and empowered the deaths of black people at the hands of the police. I'm not trying to fight for Biden right now. And I'm not trying to fight for Trump at all in any way, shape, or form. But a vote for Biden is a vote for Trump in my eyes right now.\n\nAT: And Biden is incredibly weak on so many issues, I mean, even if he was able to give a coherent speech, right. I mean, if you look at his record in terms of his stance on trade agreements, his stance on foreign intervention, his stance on criminal justice. I mean, his record's terrible. The fact that he is only now in this campaign season flip-flopping on the Hyde Amendment right of saying abortion should be, yes, considered medical coverage and covered by federal funds. It's unconscionable, you know, I think for people to get behind him when you have an alternative, Bernie Sanders, who has been, you know, standing for these principles and unwavering in them. And so we have to turn up the heat and go hard and the record, Biden's record speaks for itself. And we are also in a moment not only should we abhor that record as people on the left, but those are all things that Trump is going to go after him for too.\n\nJS: Aja, because you also in your work and in your personal life, have focused on the rights of the Palestinian people. I just want to read part of this statement, and then ask you about Sanders and the position that he is taking daily in his speeches on Palestine. But from your statement, it says \"We stand with the abolitionists, healers and storytellers who pursue a world where we are brave enough to consider one another and fight for each other. We envision a world where discrimination, war and white terrorism are laughed out of the room and become a thing of our past. Where we honor the dignity, respect and self-determination of the Palestinian people, where the people of Puerto Rico are free of colonial debt and domination.\"\n\nAM: It applies to all of our foreign policy. I think the biggest and starkest difference in Sanders's rhetoric and in his policy and in his actions and his debate, you know, debate stage moments is that he makes a clear distinction on his understanding of how we have as America have engaged the folks who we are in agreement with and the folks we are in disagreement with. Sanders has a humanistic, like, basic justice approach to how we talk about the dignity and the self-determination of all people, that all children matter, that all women matter that all working people matter in this country, but also in this globe.\n\nAnd so when we talk about Palestine, one of the biggest things doing the work in the past few years, that's incredibly encouraging, but also, just a demonstration of the work we've been doing is to go from five years ago when you couldn't really say the word Palestine on a national network without being terrified of being called anti-semitic. You know, and here we have a presidential candidate who's brought up the dignity of Palestinian people on a debate stage - a national debate stage.\n\nBS: What our foreign policy in the Mideast should be about is absolutely protecting the independence and security of Israel. But you cannot ignore the suffering of the Palestinian people. We have got to have a policy that reaches out to the Palestinians and the Americans and an answer to your question that will come within the context of bringing nations together in the Mideast.\n\nAM: And that happened because of the people on the ground, that happened because of the shifting of the culture. All of the things that Sanders is running on is from us. It's from the movement. It's from the people. It's from the folks who have been organizing. He could not run on this platform if it wasn't for all the millions and millions of people who have been shifting and pushing and organizing and knocking on doors and sitting through meetings and fighting and protesting for years so that this is now normalized so that now we can have a conversation about the hard difficult realities of American foreign policy.\n\nAnd bigger than that, you know, Puerto Rico, something that Trump has made of buffoonery in one of the most desperate times of the Puerto Rican people, we still have not had a full conversation about what colonial American project has done to Puerto Rico.\n\nAnd so there's a lot to be said for our foreign policy that has made it so that we've spent too much on the military budget, and not enough on our domestic needs, and so if we have better relationships with our comrades across the globe, then we wouldn't need to be spending so much money, defending ourselves and putting families at risk in other places that they don't need to be.\n\nJS: And Astra, at the same time, Sanders has totally transformed the conversation in this country and is never given credit for it by the establishment Democrats who are now parroting some of his talking points because they realize that history is not on their side, and that this moment is not on their side on those core issues.\n\nAT: Absolutely. I mean, two things. One, I did see an article in The New York Times recently, it was like Bernie Sanders has won the war of ideas and was sort of like you've won go home now. So maybe they'll give him credit if they think it will shoo him away. But it's absolutely true. I actually was in a conversation with friends collecting examples of what concrete policies came from the grassroots: home guarantee, student debt cancellation, medical debt cancellation. Sanders has been working with some of the best disability activists and most radical disability activists I know and this question like, well, what is feminism to me? That is a feminist mode is to listen to the grassroots and incorporate their missions into your platform, right? I mean, we saw this the other night when, you know, Sanders did his event in Flint and shared the stage with other activists and speakers.\n\nNayyirah Shariff: The obstructions to our liberation and our recovery. So what can you do for us, for Flint?\n\nBS: OK, I'm gonna answer that. I'm gonna ask you a question. Am I correct in remembering and I may be wrong on this, but not only have you had a water crisis in terms of poisoning your water, but you're also paying outrageously high water rates, is that the case?\n\nNS: Yes and they could even double again this year?\n\nAT: There's something very permeable about the campaign and that's, you know, really powerful for me as someone who's been in the fight for student debt cancellation. Nothing could be starker than the contrast between Sanders and Biden.\n\nWhat is Biden's higher education platform? It's essentially I'm gonna undo what I did in 2005, right. A core piece of the Biden higher education student debt campaign is to say, oh, I will put back bankruptcy protections. Well, guess what Biden's famous for? Eliminating bankruptcy protections for student debtors because he was a Delaware senator and you know, was paying attention to lobbyists, not the people. He wasn't paying attention to Elizabeth Warren at the time, who said, hey, this is a really bad move, and actually will impact women, most of all. So, you know, you've got Sanders who's saying, Let's wipe the slate clean. In fact, it's something he can do in the first hundred days without going to Congress. You know, this is something that is a material benefit that people would get from a Sanders administration versus in Biden, who's basically like, oops, let me hit the undo button on a mistake I made very recently.\n\nJS: You know, I hesitate to delve into this issue, but I feel like it's an important one to take head-on and I'm curious your thoughts. I mean, clearly we have two older white men who both have had health struggles in this election. On the one hand, you have Bernie Sanders who did have a heart attack, and he is up there in age. Though we've seen the letters that have come out from his doctors. And then on the other hand, you have Joe Biden, and Biden is saying things like he's looking forward to appointing the first African American woman to the Senate. He often seems to not know what state he is in.\n\nIf you watch video of Joe Biden over the years, he consistently has been a problematic, let's say, public speaker, but there's something very different going on here. And it's part of why people are calling him Joe Hidin' now is because they really are trying to limit his public appearances. But because you are all firmly saying now that the movement to elect Sanders needs to happen and you're encouraging friends and comrades and colleagues from across the spectrum to join you in this, what do you say to people who say \"Well, I'm nervous about Bernie Sanders. He's an old man and he's had a heart attack?\"\n\nAM: The root and the basic fundamental thing of any organizer is building relationships. It is always important to understand the power and the transformational need of building relationships with people. Bernie understands that. When you look at the base, when you look at the range of people who are in his campaign, who support the movement, who are part of organizations that have endorsed the movement, folks who have been a part of pushing the policies, Bernie has grown. Even his stance on Palestine is a stance that has grown. You could not talk about a Bernie stance on Palestine now without talking about Linda Sarsour. But it's through the conversations and through the listening, which is so funny people make it seem like Sanders is this crazy old white man who's just a radical and you know, doesn't know how to listen or anything. He actually is someone that is very introspective and very insightful about the people that are that he's representing, about being a public servant. He's not here for a personal agenda. He's here to be in service to the people.\n\nYou know, years ago that I would expect myself to be endorsing or supporting an older white man for president. You know, rhetorically, that sounds crazy, right? But in actuality, identity is an entry point. It is not the end. It is the way by which we are informed of how the world and power dynamics affect our daily lives. What makes someone a true comrade, what makes someone who's willing to be in solidarity with you as someone that understands the interrelations of power, how power changes and transforms based on the people that you are in conversation and movement with. And I think Sanders has built a coalition of people who are constantly in struggle with one another to understand the different power dynamics, to understand our relationship to white supremacy, to understand our relationship to patriarchy, to understand our relationship to capitalism, etc. And we're breaking those things down, day to day, person by person.\n\nAnd this is where I'll end. Sanders has one of the most leader-full movements that I have ever seen in an electoral campaign. If tomorrow Sanders dies, the movement will not die with him and that is very clear. Sanders has created the conditions by which folks are ready to take on whatever is ahead. And I think I am so inspired by all the young people. I see Isra [Hirsi]. I see Kenidra [Woods]. I see AOC. I see there's so many young people who have been a part of this moment, and we need to stop focusing on Sanders and focus on the people who are behind him. Sanders is not prescriptive, he is the diagnosis. He is the person that is telling us what is the issue. It's up to us to be the solution. It's up to us to solve these issues. And he continues to say that the people keep making it about him.\n\nJS: As we wrap up Astra, it clearly is going to be a brutal battle. It's gonna probably get much uglier going forward, do you remain hopeful that Sanders can actually pull off a victory here, given all of the forces that you guys have been describing aligned against him?\n\nAT: I don't know if hopeful is the right word, but I remain dedicated. We have to keep trying and Aja is exactly right. You know, we try to get Sanders elected. And that means that we remember relationships are key and we reach out to people in good faith and try to expand the movement. But also, again, there's this bigger movement, this extra electoral movement, that's not going anywhere. And we also want to welcome people into that and so you know, I want to seize this moment. OK, everyone wants to talk about feminism. Let's talk about feminism. What do we mean by it, right? It's not just about a few women at the top of a society shaped like a pyramid where there are a bunch of poor people at the bottom. No, feminism is fighting for all of these transformative social policies, right? It's taking care of everybody and sharing the burden of work and care and pleasure and opportunity. Let's have those conversations. Let's keep the bigger picture in mind, and remember that in fact, we have come a tremendous way. Let's not get cynical. Let's not act like losing is preordained. The battle is still going.\n\nJS: Aja, last question, your thoughts now going forward, given the forces aligned against this movement from Wall Street, corporate PAC money all the way to elite figures in both the Democratic and Republican parties.\n\nAM: The people will always have the power. And so I'm inspired by every single person who has taken a stand in this moment. I don't need friends. I need comrades. I need sisters. I need brothers. We need people who are going to stand with each other whether we agree or not for what's right. Capitalism exists in the effort to demoralize and dehumanize people and so we need to do what is necessary to heal and to rectify any differences that have been used to divide our people and divide this country and we have to start to think about what a revolution looks like rooted in love and righteous anger and legitimize this movement because what's happening here is going to inspire generations to come.\n\nThe young people have it, they got it. They don't need any proof to say, look outside, the sea levels are rising. Look beyond you, look at the news, people are dying. They can see everything. They don't need a bunch of rhetoric and a bunch of talking points. And so I am very inspired by this moment. I see young people really, really taking charge. Whether Sanders wins this election, he already won. He won the hearts of millions of people. And he actually shifted the culture of this country and the narrative and so I'm ready to take whatever comes of this and to move forward.\n\nJS: Aja Monet, thank you very much for being with us.\n\nAM: Thank you. Thank you all.\n\nJS: Astra Taylor, thank you as well.\n\nAT: Thanks.\n\nJS: Aja Monet is a Brooklyn-born Cuban-Jamaican poet and activist.

      "text": "Intercepted Podcast: Legacy of Blood - the 55-Year U.S. War Against Iraqis\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nJeremy Scahill gives a history of U.S. Iraq policy. Mehdi Hasan talks about \"60 Minutes\" fawning over the Saudi prince. Author Eve Ewing discusses her new book.\n\nThis week marks the 15th anniversary of the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. But what is almost never discussed is the fact that the U.S. has been waging war against the Iraqi people over the past six decades. This week on Intercepted: Jeremy digs deep into the U.S. legacy in Iraq, beginning with the CIA-backed overthrow of a popular leader who nationalized Iraq's oil and overthrew the British-backed monarchy. It is a history that spans 11 U.S. presidents, both Democratic and Republican. U.S. policy has always been about the interests of Western capitalism and the flags of American victories have long been planted on the corpses of Iraqi civilians. Mehdi Hasan, host of the new Intercept podcast \"Deconstructed,\" talks about the commercial that \"60 Minutes\" ran for Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the war in Syria. Matthew Cole talks about how before becoming FBI director, Chris Wray supervised an investigation that found that Blackwater founder Erik Prince likely broke U.S. laws. What happens now to the Prince investigations? The Intercept's Sam Biddle takes us inside the Cambridge Analytica scandal and the chaos at Facebook. And artist, writer, and educator Eve Ewing talks about her new book \"Electric Arches,\" how Trump talks about Chicago, and she imagines LeBron James journeying through time to meet his teenage self. And an undercover investigation reveals Prestige Worldwide's use of prostitutes to influence the outcome of elections.\n\nChannel 4 Reporter: Finally, the man at the helm of Cambridge Analytica, CEO Alexander Nicks, has agreed to meet. In a phone call, first to our fixer, the final sales pitch begins.\n\nWill Ferrell (as Brennan Huff in \"Step Brothers\"): I'm just gonna come out and say it, I'm ready to take on the Catalina wine mixer. I've been earning and burning, snapping necks and cashing checks. And I'm ready to nail it. I want it! OK? I want the Catalina wine mixer.\n\nChannel 4 Reporter: It would be our final meeting with Cambridge Analytica. This, the man who, in public, eulogizes free and fair elections but who, in private, we're about to discover, appears to play dirty.\n\nUndercover Reporter: And what we want to know what is the expertise of the deep digging that you can do to make sure that people know the true identities and secrets of these people.\n\nJohn C. Reilly (as Dale Doback) : You're probably wondering why we gathered you here tonight. We thought we'd roll out a once-in-a-lifetime business opportunity.\n\nWF : Prestige, worldwide ... wide ... wide ... wide.\n\nJCR: Management.\n\nWF: Financial portfolios. Insurance.\n\nJCR: Computers.\n\nWF: Black leather gloves.\n\nJCR : Research and development, putting in the man-hours to study the science of what you need.\n\nWF: Last week, we put liquid paper on a bee. And it died.\n\nJCR: Security!\n\nWF: Security!\n\nJCR: And -\n\nWF: And -\n\nJCR: Investors ...\n\nWF: Possibly you!\n\nChannel 4 Reporter: So, there you have it: the self-proclaimed digital masterminds. How much of this was hype, how much the truth? We may never know.\n\n[Musical interlude.]\n\nJeremy Scahill: This is Intercepted.\n\n[Musical interlude.]\n\nJS: I'm Jeremy Scahill, coming to you from the offices of The Intercept in New York City and this is episode 49 of Intercepted.\n\nJim Miklaszewski: There are reports that there is no evidence of a direct link between Baghdad and some of these terrorist organizations.\n\nSecretary of State Donald Rumsfeld: There are known knowns. There are things we know we know. We also know there are known unknowns - that is to say we know there are some things we do not know. But there are also unknown unknowns, the ones we don't know we don't know.\n\nJS: This week marks the 15th anniversary of the 2003 U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq, and it's important that we examine what happened, how it happened: the lies, the crimes, the mass killings, the destruction - all of it. And George W. Bush, and Dick Cheney, and the neocons all should hold a special place in the hall of shame for mass killers for what they did to Iraq.\n\nBut they did it with the support of many in Congress, including some of the most prominent and elite Democrats.\n\nBut I also believe that we need to understand how we got to where we are today in Iraq because this is a classic case study in U.S. imperial crimes.\n\nAnd that means stepping back and examining a much broader history. It's a 55-year history that is filled with constant interventions and bombings and sanctions and covert CIA activity and regime change. And in this history, a history you never hear discussed on cable news, the main victims are, as they've always been: ordinary Iraqis.\n\nNewscaster: The latest Middle East crisis, perhaps the most menacing of all, has flared up in Iraq, a country that produces over 30 million tons of oil a year. In this picture, King Faisal is at Kirkuk with his uncle, Crown Prince 'Abd al-Ilah.\n\nJS: July 14, 1958: Baghdad, Iraq. Army Brigadier General Abd al-Karim Qasim leads a military revolt against the British-backed Iraqi monarchy.\n\nNewscaster: Without warning, revolution has swept away the young King Faisal of Iraq and his uncle Crown Prince 'Abd al-Ilah. Iraq becomes number one danger spot. Veteran premier Nuri al-Said is deposed. He has fled, and the Republic rebels have offered 10,000 pounds for his arrest. The tide of Arab nationalism is again in flight.\n\nJS: Facing almost no resistance, the Iraqi rebels seize key military and government installations in Baghdad and elsewhere in the country and they declare an end to the era of the Hashemite royals who ruled Iraq backed by the iron fist of Western colonial powers.\n\nAbd al-Karim Qasim: Our revolution is a real reaction against tyranny and corruption. We want to use our wealth to raise the standard of living of the people.\n\nJS: Abd al-Karim Qasim declares Iraq a republic, and he consolidates power through a revolutionary council. Qasim and his allies created a structure for the Iraqi presidency where power will be shared by representatives of the three largest groups in Iraq: the Shia, the Sunni, and the Kurds. Qasim becomes prime minister and the new government begins to implement sweeping economic and political reforms.\n\nThis new government seized nearly all of the land in Iraq that was controlled by the British-owned Iraq Petroleum Company and redistributed that land to Iraqi farmers, and Qasim pulled out of the U.S.- and British-run Baghdad Pact, which was aimed at keeping the Soviets away from Middle Eastern oil.\n\nNewscaster: At Lancaster House in London, representatives of five nations meet to discuss a crisis. Mr. Macmillan, who presided, opened the meeting with a tribute to King Faisal.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Harold Macmillan: We meet today under the shadow of the recent, tragic events in Iraq.\n\nJS: While the British and Americans began plotting to isolate and possibly remove Qasim, the new revolutionary government in Baghdad gained rapid, widespread support in the country. Laws on women's rights were passed and amnesty was granted to Kurds who had engaged in uprisings in Iraq in the 1940s. Qasim also ended a ban on the Iraqi Communist Party. He pulled Iraq out of the security and military partnerships with the United States and other Western countries, and he normalized relations with the Soviet Union.\n\nQasim openly backed Palestinian liberation causes and the Algerian resistance against the French. He also stated clearly that oil-rich Kuwait was part of Iraq and that its independence was a project of Western oil corporations. Qasim nationalized many of Britain's oil fields and formed a new Iraqi national oil company.\n\nNewscaster: The story in the capital city of Baghdad is the scene of the latest bloody coup d'état, a demonstration of violent, 20th-century Arab tensions, set against a way of life that has changed little since the Dark Ages.\n\nJS: The United States and Britain wanted Qasim gone, and the CIA, under John F. Kennedy, began working with Iraqi factions that the U.S. believed could help overthrow Qasim - namely the Ba'ath Party, and one of its most vicious henchmen, a man who had actually tried to assassinate Qasim in 1959. His name? Saddam Hussein.\n\nAnd that assassination attempt failed. But a few years later, on February 9, 1963, Abd al-Karim Qasim was overthrown and he was executed after a bizarre show trial on Iraqi radio.\n\nNewscaster: In the storied city of Baghdad, capital of Iraq, has been the scene once more of bloody revolt, that has ceded a new government. For five years, General Abd al-Karim Qasim, right, ruled the country by armed might, after he seized power by assassinating King Faisal and the prime minister. Now, like many before him, he has fallen as he rose: Violently. A pro-communist, Qasim died before a firing squad in the wreckage of the Defense Ministry building.\n\nJS: As Saddam Hussein and the Ba'ath Party consolidated power, they massacred thousands of people, including a huge number of communists.\n\nNewscaster: Army and militiamen carry on the search for communist infiltrators, over 100,000 of whom entered Baghdad during Qasim's regime. When they are found, the communists from other countries are deported. Native reds, known for crimes perpetrated on behalf of Qasim, are sent before firing squads, as the Arabs show they are more concerned about the dangers of communism that is realized by some Western leaders.\n\nJS: The interior minister of the new regime would later say that the Ba'ath Party came to power on a CIA train. Yes, a decade after overthrowing the democratically elected leader, Mossadegh, in Iran, the CIA played a similar role in toppling the Iraqi government, which like Mossadegh was unfriendly to colonial Western oil corporations.\n\nThe CIA provided lists of people for Saddam and his men to exterminate. Those lists were compiled at CIA stations across the Middle East. Suspected communists, leftists or supporters of Qasim, were tortured and summarily executed.\n\nNewscaster: The streets of ancient Baghdad become the scene of a short but decisive revolution that topples the pro-communist government, of Premier Abd al-Karim Qasim, shown here on the right. A six-man military junta seizes power on a holy day, and within hours, the premier, who reportedly had executed 10,000 people, is himself shot.\n\nJS: The U.S. and other Western powers characterize the overthrow of Qasim as a victory against Soviet incursions into the Middle East, and Washington responded enthusiastically to Qasim's downfall. The characterization that it was a massive blow to the Soviet Union became the dominant narrative, and the United States started to resume military aid to the new Ba'athist regime.\n\n[\"Ba'ath Party Anthem\" plays.]\n\nBy the time Saddam Hussein officially took over as the president of Iraq in 1979, the country was considered by the U.S. to be one of its most strategically important regimes in the Middle East, particularly after the U.S. backed-shah was overthrown in neighboring Iran.\n\nNewscaster: Khomeini, almost unknown outside of Iran just a few months ago, returned a hero: The man who, from long distance, had led the revolution to topple the shah. Inside the airport terminal, Khomeini was greeted by scores of Muslim religious leaders and political allies. He called on Iranian Prime Minister Bakhtiar to resign and said all foreigners should leave the country.\n\nIn an obvious reference to the United States, he said, \"Foreign advisers have ruined our culture and have taken our oil.\"\n\nJS: When the Islamic Revolution of Iran happened in 1979, the Iran-Iraq War soon followed, and would kill hundreds of thousands of people - some estimates say as many as a million dead. The United States supported both sides in that war, but no doubt wanted Iraq to win.\n\nSaddam was known as a brutal mass murderer, but that was preferable to Washington over an Islamist government. U.S. war planners gave Saddam Hussein targets to bomb throughout Iran, they poured weapons into the effort and the Reagan administration removed Iraq from the list of state sponsors of terrorism so that the weapons could flow unimpeded.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan: Well, the Ayatollah is in a war, and if he's going to go on with provocative acts against us or anyone else, then he's running a great risk because we're going to respond.\n\nJS: After Reagan removed Iraq from the list of state sponsors of terrorism, the U.S. began increasing its military aid to Iraq, including selling Iraq attack helicopters - helicopters that were used in the most famous incident of the Iran-Iraq War involving chemical weapons, and that was when Saddam Hussein ordered the gassing of Kurds in Halabja.\n\nDonald Rumsfeld, who was a private citizen at the time, was tapped by the Reagan administration as a special envoy and he traveled to Iraq in 1983 to deliver a gift to Saddam Hussein from Ronald Reagan. It was a pair of golden cowboy spurs.\n\nJamie McIntyre: Tell me what was going on during this, this period?\n\nDonald Rumsfeld: Where did you get his video, from the Iraqi television - ?\n\nJM: This is from Iraqi television.\n\nDR: When did they give it to you? Recently, or back then?\n\nJM: No, we dug this out of the CNN library.\n\nDR: I see. Isn't that interesting. There I am.\n\nJM: So, so what was going on here? What were you thinking at the time?\n\nDR: Well, Iraq was in a battle, a war with Iran and the United States had just had 241 Marines killed, and president Reagan asked me to take a leave of absence from my company -\n\nJS: In that meeting, Donald Rumsfeld and Saddam Hussein discussed solidifying U.S.-Iraqi relations, and it was during this period when the U.S. was at its most cozy with Saddam Hussein that the Iraqi dictator was at his most brutal. He was a mass murderer, but he was Washington's mass murderer.\n\nIt was only when Saddam Hussein decided to invade oil-rich Kuwait, a country that many Iraqis characterized as an oil field with a flag, that the U.S. posture changed.\n\nSuddenly, overnight, Saddam was being compared to Hitler, and George H.W. Bush launched a massive air attack on Iraq in 1991.\n\nPresident George H.W. Bush: Just two hours ago, allied air forces began an attack on military targets in Iraq, in Kuwait. These attacks continue as I speak. Ground forces are not engaged. This conflict started August 2, when the dictator of Iraq invaded a small and helpless neighbor: Kuwait, a member of the Arab League and a member of the United Nations, was crushed. Its people brutalized.\n\nJS: Despite Bush's claim that the U.S. led attack was aimed at the Iraqi military and Saddam Hussein, the Gulf War saw the United States bomb Iraq back centuries. Its civilian infrastructure was obliterated; its water treatment and sewage facilities destroyed. The U.S. also heavily used depleted uranium munitions that would later cause a skyrocket in cancer and birth defects.\n\nBut George H.W. Bush decided to keep Saddam Hussein in power. Why? Because he was considered preferable to an Islamic government, particularly one that would have aligned itself with Iran. And so, Saddam remained.\n\nGHWB: As commander-in-chief, I can report to you, our armed forces fought with honor and valor. And as president, I can report to the nation, aggression is defeated. The war is over. [Cheers and applause.]\n\nJS: Under Bill Clinton, the U.S. imposed the most sweeping economic sanctions in modern history. It was tantamount to economic warfare. Not on Saddam or his government or his henchmen, but on the Iraqi people.\n\nWhen the United Nations estimated that upwards of half a million Iraqis were killed as a result of the sanctions, Bill Clinton's Secretary of State Madeleine Albright defended it on \"60 Minutes.\"\n\nLesley Stahl: We have heard that a half a million children have died. I mean, that's more children than died in Hiroshima. And, and, you know, is the price worth it?\n\nSecretary of State Madeleine Albright: I think this is a very hard choice, but the price, we think the price is worth it.\n\nJS: In addition to the sanctions that Madeline Albright was defending, Clinton initiated the longest sustained U.S. bombing campaign since Vietnam, at some points bombing Iraq an average of once every three days throughout the 1990s.\n\nPresident William \"Bill\" Jefferson Clinton: My fellow Americans, this evening I want to speak with you about an attack by the government of Iraq against the United States and the actions we have just taken to respond. This past April, the Kuwaiti government uncovered what they suspected was a car bombing plot to assassinate former president George Bush while he was visiting Kuwait City. The Kuwaiti authorities arrested 16 suspects, including two Iraqi nationals.\n\nJS: In response to an alleged plot to kill former President George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton ordered an airstrike in Baghdad that killed several Iraqi civilians, including the famed painter Layla Al-Attar.\n\nKris Kristofferson: (singing \"The Circle\"): Who killed this woman, this artist, this mother? Who broke the candle and snuffed out her light? Along with her husband and wounded her husband and sauntered away like a beast in the night. Not I, said the soldier, I just followed orders, and it was my duty to do my job well. Not I, said the leader, who ordered the slaughter. I'm saddened it happened, but that war is hell. Not us said the others -\n\nJS: I can say from having spent extensive time in Iraq in the 1990s, that its hospitals were like death rows for infants. There were no medical supplies. Birth defects that weren't found in modern medical journals were appearing. Syringes were being reused and hospital floors were being cleaned with gasoline.\n\nIraqi Woman: He's one of the crime, of the American crime. And if the Bush or the Clinton, they know exactly what happened here. They hung themself by themself, I thought. And which crime were done by our children to receive this punishment? Only the Iraq children, believe me. Most of the children are dying because of the cancer, congenital malformation, malnutrition - they are diseased. And this is one of the weapons of mass destruction against Iraq. This is not only use of chemical weapon, but also this make everyone illiterate, sick, and reduce the generation of the future. This is one of the mass destructions against Iraq.\n\nJS: A once secular society with advanced schools and progressive positions on women's rights, relative to its neighbors, Iraq started to become much more religious. In 1998, Bill Clinton signed the Iraq Liberation Act which was authored by the neoconservatives of the Project For A New American Century. Quite a few of the PNAC gang are now on MSNBC regularly, celebrating their principle in opposing Trump and never answering for their crimes in Iraq.\n\nBut that legislation signed not by Bush, but Bill Clinton, made regime change the law of the land. Even Bernie Sanders supported it.\n\nBill Clinton: The hard fact is that so long as Saddam remains in power he threatens the well being of his people, the peace of this region, the security of the world. The best way to end that threat, once and for all, is with a new Iraqi government.\n\nJS: George W. Bush and Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld came into power with a mission to overthrow Saddam Hussein. 9/11 was not even hours old when Rumsfeld started pushing to invade and attack Iraq, a nation that had absolutely nothing to do with 9/11. This push to war was aided by powerful media organizations that breathlessly reported on Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Prominent Democrats and Republicans pushed this myth.\n\nThen-F.B.I. director and current special prosecutor Robert Mueller also pushed those lies in front of Congress. Former Vice President Joe Biden, who at the time was the chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, refused to call a single antiwar witness to the hearings that he conducted on the eve of the invasion of Iraq. And neocons like Paul Wolfowitz promised America that the occupation would pay for itself and go swimmingly.\n\nPaul Wolfowitz: These are Arabs, 23 million of the most educated people in the Arab world, who are going to welcome us as liberators. And when that message gets out to the whole Arab world it is going to be a powerful counter to Osama bin Laden. The notion that we're going to earn more enemies by going in and getting rid of what every Arab knows is one of the worst tyrants, and they have many governing them, is just nonsense.\n\nJS: This was an elite bipartisan beating of the war drum that culminated with Secretary of State Colin Powell's infamous speech at the United Nations Security Council.\n\nSecretary of State Colin Powell: We have firsthand descriptions of biological weapons factories on wheels and on rails. The trucks and train cars are easily moved and are designed to evade detection by inspectors. In a matter of months, they can produce a quantity of biological poison equal to the entire amount that Iraq claimed to have produced in the years prior to the Gulf War.\n\nJS: None of that, of course, was true. And 15 years ago this week, the U.S. began its invasion and occupation of Iraq with massive air strikes across the country in an operation called Shock and Awe.\n\n[Bombs falling on Baghdad.]\n\nHundreds of thousands of Iraqis were killed throughout the course of the U.S. occupation; millions were forced to flee their homes and the country. The U.S.-backed death squads and paramilitary militias conducted massacres in cities like Fallujah and encouraged sectarian battles. Mercenaries, including those from Blackwater, poured into the country: war profiteers. And Iraq became a massive killing field.\n\nBut the image of Saddam's statue being pulled down in Firdos Square helped the myth that victory was as simple as the neocons promised.\n\nAnd just months into the occupation, George W. Bush declared victory.\n\nPresident George W. Bush: Thank you very much. Admiral Kelly, Captain Card, officers and sailors of the USS Abraham Lincoln, my fellow Americans. Major combat operations in Iraq have ended. In the battle of Iraq, the United States and our allies have prevailed. [Cheers and shouts.]\n\nJS: Despite this idiotic and sick display by George W. Bush, where he dressed up as a military pilot and stood in front of that \"Mission Accomplished\" banner on the warship, the war in Iraq was just starting. The viceroy that was sent to Iraq to run the Green Zone and the occupation, L. Paul Bremmer, he was a neocon who profited off of risk insurance and he made a series of disastrous and stupid decisions. His de-Ba'athification edict resulted in 250,000 Iraqi soldiers losing their jobs. It wasn't long before they joined the resistance. And by the end of 2004, here were both Shiite and Sunni uprisings against the United States.\n\nIt was at this point that large numbers of U.S. soldiers began to die. And in D.C., Bush and Cheney and Rumsfeld were whistling past the graveyard and minimizing the anti-U.S. uprisings.\n\nVice President Dick Cheney: The level of activity that we see today from a military standpoint I think will clearly decline. I think they're in the, in the last throes, if you will, of the insurgency.\n\nJS: The highest price for this invasion and occupation was of course paid by ordinary Iraqis. And it didn't take long after Saddam Hussein was executed before his trials were even complete for Saddam Hussein's popularity to rise. Many Iraqis hated Saddam, despised him but they hated what the U.S. had done to their country even more and that phenomenon continues to this day. In fact, Saddam has never been more popular.\n\nPresident Barack Obama: We are in full agreement about how to move forward. So, today, I can report that as promised the rest of our troops in Iraq will come home by the end of the year. After nearly nine years, America's war in Iraq will be over.\n\nJS: Barack Obama, who campaigned as an anti-Iraq War candidate, did pull most U.S. troops out of Iraq. But then he quickly changed course and sent thousands back as fighting intensified along the Iraq-Syria border.\n\nWhat the U.S. started in Iraq ultimately spilled over into Syria, and out of the ashes of a disastrous U.S. policy, ISIS rose. And some of their most sophisticated military operatives and strategists had been Iraqi soldiers fired by Paul Bremmer in 2003 and 2004.\n\nAt least one Iraqi general, a famous one, he was on the deck of cards that the U.S. military created for the kill/capture campaign of high-value targets. He had worked with the U.S. during the Iran-Iraq war; he ended up joining ISIS. And when Obama left office, there were more than 5,000 U.S. troops in Iraq and an expanding U.S. Air War.\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump: I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity at Fox and Sean Hannity said, he said, \"You were totally against war because he was for the war.\"\n\nLester Holt: Why is your judgment better?\n\nDJT: And wait, excuse me. And that was before the war started. I was against the war, he said, \"You used to have fights with me.\" Because Sean was in favor of the war. And I understand that side also - not very much because we should have never been there. But nobody called Sean Hannity.\n\nJS: On the campaign trail, Donald Trump railed against the Iraq war, claimed he was always against it, which of course is not true but he still managed to make some valid points during the campaign, albeit in a very Trump way.\n\nDJT: George Bush made a mistake. We can make mistakes. But that one was a beauty. We should have never been in Iraq. We have destabilized the Middle East.\n\nJohn Dickerson: You still think he should be impeached?\n\nDJT: You do whatever you want, you call it whatever you want, I wanna tell you: They lied. They said there were weapons of mass destruction. There were none. And they knew there none. There were no weapons of mass destruction.\n\nJS: Despite all of Trump's rhetoric on the campaign trail, he came into office and proceeded to start ratcheting up the bombing in Iraq and Syria. He loosened rules on killing civilians and the death tolls skyrocketed.\n\nIraq today remains shattered and violent and dangerous and sectarian. And the U.S. continues to play a destabilizing role on top of the legacy of blood that it had already created in Iraq. From the 1960s and the CIA working with Saddam and the Ba'ath Party, to the weapons, intelligence, and support for Saddam during the Iran-Iraq War, to the Gulf War and the destruction of the civilian infrastructure, to the sanctions and the no-fly zone bombings, to the lies about WMDs and the invasion of Iraq, from the stupidity of the neocons before and during the occupation to the massive refugee crisis caused by the war: U.S. policy has been consistent. For the past 55 years, there has been one central truth about the U.S. role in Iraq. And that is: that it's been consistently anti-Iraqi people.\n\nSince the 1960s, U.S. policy under Democrats and Republicans has been about the interests of Western capitalism and the flags of American victories have always been planted violently on piles of Iraqi corpses.\n\nTo discuss well, just the past 15 years, since the U.S. invaded and occupied Iraq, and also the visit of the Saudi Crown Prince who happens to be Jared Kushner's new BFF, Mohammed bin Salman to the United States, and this commercial that aired as a \"60 Minutes\" segment this weekend, I'm joined by my colleague Mehdi Hasan. You likely know him as a ferocious interrogator of powerful people from his Al-Jazeera show \"UpFront.\" Or maybe you've read his columns on The Intercept or watched his excellent video series for theintercept.com on blowback.\n\nWell, now you're going to get Mehdi in a totally new format. He's going to be hosting a weekly podcast for The Intercept starting this Friday. It's called Deconstructed. I'm really looking forward to this, and I think it's going to make an excellent companion to this show but also a very important program in its own right.\n\nMehdi Hasan, welcome back to Intercepted.\n\nMehdi Hasan: Hi Jeremy, thanks for having me on.\n\nJS: First I want to congratulate you on the launch of your new podcast for The Intercept which premieres on Friday. It's called Deconstructed.\n\nGive people a sense, Mehdi, of what you're going to be doing on that show and its format and the kinds of guests you're going to be interviewing.\n\nMH: Thanks, Jeremy. I'm very excited about launching this podcast with The Intercept on Friday. As some of your listeners may know, I'm a TV journalist, I present TV programs, I've been doing interviews on TV for years now, but I'm very excited about getting into podcasting. It's a very different format. You've mastered it so well so I'm going to try and follow in your footsteps and do this weekly show.\n\nIt's going to be a half-hour long. It's called \"Deconstructed.\" It basically does what it says on the tin. We're going to try and take a big story of the week and really take it apart, Jeremy, really go at it from all sides and try to understand what's been missed, what's been distorted, what's been misrepresented - like you, I'm not a great fan of the quote-unquote MSM, the mainstream media, especially cable news as, as an immigrant, Jeremy, as a foreigner living in this great country of yours, I just find it so bizarre the way in which news stories are chosen, discussed, debated, and I want to bring a slightly different approach to things - dare I say a slightly more serious and substantive look - at big stories, whether it's you know the crown prince of Saudi Arabia visiting the U.S. and getting softballs on \"60 Minutes\" or whether it's stories like poverty and inequality and how the corporate media basically just doesn't cover these issues that matter to so many millions of Americans.\n\nJS: You've also been doing this great video series for The Intercept, \"Blowback,\" and the most recent episode of that focuses on how the U.S. invasion of Iraq gave rise to ISIS, and as we speak now we are commemorating the 15th anniversary of the U.S. invasion, occupation, destruction of Iraq and you recently had on one of the main mouthpieces for the Pentagon during that war, General Mark Kimmitt, who was the principal spokesperson for the United States military at the height of the brutality of the early stages of the Iraq war. And let's take a listen to how Mehdi Hasan interviews powerful people like generals from the United States military:\n\nMH: 15 years on from that invasion and occupation of Iraq by the U.S. and its allies, do you have any regrets? Do you have anything you want to apologize for? You think the U.S. should apologize for?\n\nGeneral Mark Kimmitt: There is nothing to apologize for.\n\nMH: Nothing to apologize for. So when the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003, in defiance of international law, no WMDs found, no al-Qaeda connections, terror threat to the U.S. increased, thousands of people tortured, hundreds of thousands killed, millions displaced from their homes, Iran's influence increased in the region, ISIL born in Iraq, several trillion dollars burned through in the process, you don't think that requires any kind of, \"You know what? We got some things wrong?\"\n\nJS: That's Mehdi Hasan questioning General Mark Kimmitt on his television program. Mehdi, your thoughts on 15 years removed from the start of the U.S. invasion of Iraq.\n\nYeah, I mean, these anniversaries sadly they come and go, I can't believe it's been 15 years, 15 years of a horror show, 15 years, Jeremy, of a war that's still not over, that's still ongoing.\n\nI was just thinking the other day, isn't it amazing that Donald Trump was sworn into office and then began bombing Iraq, just like Barack Obama did before him and George W. Bush did before him and Bill Clinton did before him and George Bush, Sr. did before him? It's like a rite of passage for U.S. presidents. You become president, you take the oath of office and then you bomb Iraq. It's the war that never seems to end and it was a complete disaster, I think most people now agree that it was a complete disaster.\n\nWhat's so sad, Jeremy, and again, coming back to the idea of kind of media failures, is that so many of the people responsible for that war, both politicians and a lot of the journalists, the pundits who were credulous, who bought into the lies, who pushed the myths about WMD's and al-Qaeda ties, they're all still around doing well, Jeremy. There's been really no penalty. I was just watching Bill Kristol looking smug on Jake Tapper's CNN show earlier this week thinking, this guy got everything wrong about the biggest geopolitical issue of our lifetimes, hundreds of thousands of people died because of decisions made by journalists, quote-unquote, like Bill Kristol and others.\n\nWilliam \"Bill\" Kristol: George Bush is not fighting this like Vietnam. Whatever the, we don't need to really fight the whole history of Vietnam.\n\nDaniel Ellsberg: Saddam may be, that's the danger of Saddam may be.\n\nBK: But it's not going to happen. It's not going to happen. This is going to be a two-month war, not an eight-year war.\n\nDE: It's going to be two months, not six months.\n\nMH: And I think that's a reminder 15 years in that we should always be skeptical of power, questioning of governments when they want to start wars. In the UK, Jeremy Corbyn's being attacked for not being gung-ho and hawkish on Russia, and, you know, we have to be able to ask questions when intelligence agencies, when governments tell us, it's time to go to war against this bad guy.\n\nJS: Well and of course the current special prosecutor in the Trump-Russia investigation, Robert Mueller, was part of that very strong chorus of voices from the Bush administration - and let's be honest, some Democrats as well, including Hillary Clinton - that were promoting this lie that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction.\n\nMH: John Kerry, the candidate in 2004, supported the war in Iraq. Hillary Clinton, the candidate in 2016, supported the war in Iraq. Barack Obama didn't. Bernie Sanders didn't. But yeah it was - we couldn't have gone to war had the Democrats not fallen in line behind George W. Bush and in 2002, early 2003, and again, the lessons learned since Iraq, what are those lessons? Some say we've overlearned the lessons of Iraq. That's why we haven't taken action in Syria, to topple Bashar al-Assad.\n\nOthers say we haven't learned enough lessons. Look at Libya, and Barack Obama, the man who said he was against \"dumb wars,\" goes into Libya without Congressional approval and leaves it behind as a kind of failed state, Mad Max hell-scape in North Africa. What lessons have we actually learned from Iraq?\n\nAnd as a journalist, I think those are the key lessons that we have to learn about questioning everything that's put in front of us. And above all else, you know, let's have some consequences. You were saying on your show last week about torture and how the Obama administration, you know the way you stop torture from happening again is holding people to account, you were saying. And that's the same thing when it comes to prosecuting illegal wars. The only way we stop from jumping into mad, catastrophic, immoral bloody wars, is to really hold to account the people who have gotten us into the last few wars.\n\nJS: History and context is important and you know it's important also, even if the politicians are also people who you may agree mostly with or you like better than the others, we have an obligation to hold them all accountable. You are, I believe the best interrogator of powerful people that we have in media in this country.\n\nAnd one of the ones that I loved was this exchange that you had with General Michael Flynn, the former and now disgraced national security adviser for Donald Trump. Here is Mehdi interviewing General Flynn.\n\nMH: Just on the phraseology, when you say you've been at war with Islam.\n\nGeneral Michael Flynn: Right.\n\nMH: That's not helpful language.\n\nMF: I know!\n\nMH: Oh, no, no, no, I've had, I've had arguments with, I've sat in the - I've sat with individuals just like you.\n\nMF: Islam is a religion of a billion-plus people, and you say you're at war with ever -doesn't that give ISIL what they want? ISIL will be saying: Look at the U.S. General on Al Jazeera, he's saying he's at war with Islam, come join us, defend Islam. You're going to send recruits their way with language like that.\n\nMF: We are at a war with a radical component of Islam, and the way I believe it is that Islam is a, it's a political ideology based on a religion.\n\nMH: Islam is?\n\nMF: That's what I believe and that's how -\n\nMH: So, do you mean Islamism? Or Islam? Sorry. I'm confused.\n\nMF: Islamism. Islamism.\n\nJS: You interviewed a former CIA officer, John Sipher, we had had him on Intercepted, but here's your interaction with him.\n\nMH: Aren't you worried that you might come across as a bit of a conspiracy theorist? Because you say, well the Russians are great at this, they're great at espionage - on that grounds, you could accuse them of anything, and say, well, they're great at covering their tracks. Do you see what I mean? There's no limit to what you accuse the Russian government of.\n\nJohn Sipher: I do see what you mean, and I do acknowledge that we don't have evidence to go to a court. Like I said, we've seen behavior that's either unethical or unpatriotic.\n\nJS: Mehdi, in these cases where you really are going at powerful people, military people, CIA, politicians what's your sort of strategy and how do you prepare when you're going into, well let's just call it what it is, battle?\n\nMH: (Laughs.) It's a good question. You know, there's that famous phrase that, you know, news is what powerful people don't want people to hear, you know, everything else is just PR. And you really, the approach is: What do they not want to talk about? What do they not want to say? Let's find a way to get them to say it. Or if not to say it, at least, you know, have to deal with it, have to answer questions about it.\n\nAnd I wrote this piece earlier this week for The Intercept about Mohammad bin Salman, the Saudi Crown Prince, who just did this horrifically bad interview on \"60 Minutes\" with Norah O'Donnell in which, you know, it was a great PR puff piece for the Saudis because she didn't actually ask any of the tough questions that you would want to ask. And I wrote a piece about the questions I would have asked him had he come on my show. Of course, he's not going to come on my show because he's not stupid. But this is the crux of the matter: Are you willing, are American journalists willing to ask questions that the people in front of them, their interviewees, the senator the congressman, the administration official doesn't want to hear, will make them uncomfortable, might make mad? Or do they just want to have the friendly fireside chats? And I think that's what's important when you have people of power on.\n\nWhat's interesting about my next endeavor, about the podcast is it's a very different medium, as you know better than me, and I think as much as we like to have the bottles and have the heat, which is very important to me, we also need the light and for me I'm really excited about doing the kind of interrogations of the people in power, the General Flynns, the General Kimmitts, but also talking to people who don't maybe get the opportunity to really explain what's going on in the world and give them a chance, give them a platform, as you do so well on Intercepted.\n\nJS: You mentioned Mohammad bin Salman on \"60 Minutes\" and this absolute propaganda piece.\n\nNorah O'Donnell: Known by his initials MBS, his reforms inside Saudi Arabia have been revolutionary. He is emancipating women, introducing music and cinema, and cracking down on corruption, in a land -\n\nMH: A little bit of my dinner came up as I was watching it. I was nauseous.\n\nNO: What's been the biggest challenge?\n\nMohammad bin Salman: Well, there's a lot of challenge. I think the first big challenge that we have is: Do the people believe that what we're doing?\n\nMH: So, top of the list is Yemen, the war in Yemen is a catastrophe, UN officials have called it an apocalypse. You have millions of people at risk of starvation, cholera's back there, tens of thousands of people killed, maimed, lost their homes, in a Saudi-led war, a Saudi-led bombardment for the past nearly three years. And for Norah O'Donnell and \"60 Minutes\" to give that war two minutes out of a 30-minute segment, and in that two minutes, she allows him to say stuff like, \"You know, it's all the fault of the Houthi rebels, they're the ones who are preventing aid from getting into Yemen, which is completely untrue.\" The humanitarian agencies are very clear that yes the Houthi rebels are committing war crimes, yes they're exploiting the aid situation, but the number one reason why people are starving in Yemen, are not getting access to medicine in Yemen is because of a Saudi blockade, a Saudi embargo, Saudi restrictions on what gets in and out of the ports, and no questions on any of that in detail.\n\nNo pressure, no pushback from Norah O'Donnell when the crown prince says it's all the fault of the rebels, you know, we have - we feel really bad.\n\nNO: Do you acknowledge that it has been a humanitarian catastrophe? Five thousand civilians killed and children starving there?\n\nMBS: It is truly very painful, and I hope that this militia ceases using the humanitarian situation to their advantage in order to draw sympathy from the international community. They block humanitarian aid in order to create famine and a humanitarian crisis.\n\nMH: The tough questions on Yemen, the follow-ups on Yemen would have been, for me, key and that's what bothers me about so many interviews that are done with the rich and powerful in this country, which is a question has no value unless there's a follow-up, unless you push back against the dishonest answer that is by and large the option for most of these people when they're responding.\n\nI think another question that would have been important to ask is about, for example, the death penalty in Saudi Arabia. I'm not sure how you can do an interview with the crown prince of Saudi Arabia who claims to be a liberal reformer without asking about the death penalty. Saudi Arabia, by all accounts, has beheaded more people than ISIS.\n\nAnd how about democracy? I thought this is the land of the free. How can a U.S. journalist interview an absolute monarch and not ask about elections? Not ask about democracy. The word democracy, Jeremy, did not appear anywhere in that 30-minute segment. I watched it a second time just to make sure.\n\nJS: Mehdi, I sort of hesitate to do this, but I'm going to do it anyway: I want to ask you about the debate on the left about Syria, and, you know, of course, this doesn't represent every single person on the left, but you have sort of two prominent camps that seem to be in a constant war social media and in journalism circles, in some cases, where you have one group of people that really want Bashar al-Assad overthrown and it seems like they sort of want it accomplished by any means necessary including the United States going in and enacting regime change. And I think that there are many people within that camp that are not motivated by some sense of love for the U.S. empire, but of just being horrified at the utter massacre of civilians in Syria. And they have said that the main culprits are Bashar al-Assad and his Russian supporters, and they want regime change.\n\nOn the other hand, you have a fairly large group of people that are totally of the mindset that there should be a complete hands off Syria, and that the most stable and just resolution is that Bashar al-Assad remains in power. And, at times, some of the people in that camp really do sound like they are fans of Bashar al-Assad.\n\nThere are a lot of good-faith people who I'm sure have no love for Bashar al-Assad but know the U.S. track record and see the reality on the ground of the various proxy forces and what the CIA has done and how the Trump Administration escalating its bombing but it's a toxic debate and a toxic discussion that immediately degenerates into insanity.\n\nNow, I know you've taken a lot of heat and you've been attacked on this very issue because of your positions on Syria, but what do you make of this debate? And what's your position on Syria right now?\n\nMH: There are good faith people in this debate and they're bad faith people in this debate on both sides. There are people who defend Assad and are pro-Assad and there are people who just don't want to see the United States or Gulf countries going to war to topple Assad in a war of regime change. I would argue I'm one of those people.\n\nI'd love to see Assad gone. I'm no fan of Assad. I'm - I believe people should choose their own rulers. Of course, I hate Bashar al-Assad. But how do you get rid of him? I've never seen a good plan or a legal or moral or justifiable plan.\n\nWe just started the interview talking about Iraq. Look at the chaos in Iraq. There were a lot of good-faith Iraqis who wanted to see the back of Saddam Hussein and called for Western intervention? Didn't work out for a lot of Iraqis, hundreds of thousands are dead since 2003.\n\nSo, Syria is a mess. I never thought we'd see a mess like Iraq in my lifetime and yet we've seen one again so soon. There are no easy answers to Syria. There is no silver bullet or simple solution. And I think people who go around kind of just attacking each other, pretending that they have all the answers is a really big part of the problem.\n\nAnd yes, bad faith actors on one side saying Assad is good; bad faith actors on the other side who really don't give a damn about the Syrian people or Assad, but want to use it as a way to give Russia a bloody nose or to take Iran down. And then there are good-faith actors on both sides, Jeremy. There are people who genuinely want to see Assad gone, who see no other way of protecting the Syrian people from barrel bombs other than regime change. And there are good-faith people on the other side of the argument who really do care about the Syrian people, but don't support a Western military intervention or a Gulf-led military intervention for very good reasons.\n\nAnd I think that's why I wrote a piece for the Intercept recently saying look, the best we can do, you and I can do sitting far away in our comfortable homes and cozy offices watching the suffering is to at least just support the Syrian people regardless of whose side they're on, support them with aid, call your congressman and get them to open the borders to refugees, that's the best thing we can be doing in the short-term, because I genuinely any of us left or right, pro-war or anti-war, Shia or Sunni, have a solution to Syria in the short-term. That's the reality. The brutal, sad reality.\n\nJS: You know, my personal view of Syria is the United States should have never involved itself in Syria, including when it was shipping prisoners, like Maher Arar, to be tortured under the Assad regime. Or the covert clandestine -\n\nMH: Emailed questions to Assad's prison guards to ask him.\n\nJS: Right. And I'm against the CIA paramilitary operations in Syria. I'm against the United States increasing the number of civilians that it's killing in Syria. I'm against the Russians killing extraordinary numbers of people in Syria. And I'm against Assad crushing protests and killing, massacring civilians. But I am militantly opposed to U.S. regime change, if for no other reason but for the long history of what happens after the U.S. goes into these countries. And, you know -\n\nMH: What happens next is a question that just isn't asked. We talked about the lessons from Iraq. You mentioned earlier, a lot of people on the left, liberals who do support military action in Syria, you know, call it, whatever you want to call it, the Hillary Clinton-wing of the party, you know, people, good faith, quote-unquote liberal interventionist, humanitarian interventionist who do genuinely want to protect people who are being bombed and gassed by the Assad regime and others, the question I would ask them when we have these pointless name-calling debates, a lot of them opposed the Iraq war as you said and got angry when Fox News and George Bush and Dick Cheney called them Saddam Hussein apologists. So, do they understand why those of us who loathe Bashar al-Assad but don't support no-fly zones or bombing campaigns against him, were not Assad apologists either.\n\nAnd here's an important point: The U.S., right now, is bombing Syria and Iraq, and you know record numbers of civilian casualties under Trump, so I think all sides of the left, whether you are pro- or anti-intervention to get rid of Assad or ISIS should at least acknowledge what is the U.S. doing right now? It's very easy to condemn Russia or Syria for bombing, and we should condemn them for bombing and killing civilians, but right now Western governments, led by the United States, are killing record numbers of civilians on the ground in Syria and Iraq. Donald Trump doesn't give a damn about Syrian lives, let's not delude ourselves on that front.\n\nAnd here's an important point to link back to another earlier discussion of ours about Yemen and Mohammad bin Salman: Some people say to me, \"Oh, how come you're so agitated about Yemen, you're always calling for doing stuff in Yemen.\" What is interesting, because in Yemen, of course, we can actually stop the war. This is another problem with Syria: I'd love to stop the war, I just don't know how to. I've never seen a viable, credible, moral legal plan that would end the violence.\n\nIn Yemen, we actually could end the violence. We actually are arming the Saudis, refueling their fighter jets in mid-air, providing them with Intel and obviously giving them diplomatic cover at the United Nations and elsewhere. We actually do have some leverage over the Saudi government and its allies in Yemen.\n\nYou know, we spend all of it on a war we can't stop rather than one we can stop, and I find that so morally and politically indefensible.\n\nJS: Mehdi Hasan, one of the great journalists of our time and someone that I really, truly believe is the best interrogator of the powerful operating in the news media today.\n\nMH: Ah, you're too kind, Mr. Scahill, you're too kind.\n\nJS: Alright, thanks, Mehdi.\n\nMH: Thanks.\n\nJS: Mehdi Hasan is an Al Jazeera host, he's a columnist for The Intercept, and he's now the host of a new weekly podcast for The Intercept. It's called Deconstructed. Hop onto iTunes or wherever you get your podcasts and hit that subscribe button.\n\nAnd oh! A note for our listeners: We're going to be putting the first episode down this podcast feed so you'll already have it on your device.\n\n[Musical interlude.]\n\nJS: A quick update on our ongoing reporting on the activities of Blackwater founder Erik Prince. You may recall that my colleague Matthew Cole and I discussed Erik Prince on last week's show. Well, Matthew and I have a new story up this week at The Intercept that reveals for the first time that before he was Trump's FBI director, Chris Wray, and another current senior Justice Department official, Rob Hur, were partners at a white-collar law firm called King & Spalding, and they were hired by Erik Prince's Chinese company, Frontier Services Group to do an internal investigation into possible violations of U.S. law committed by Erik Prince - and these involved Erik Prince's plan to sell modified paramilitary aircraft to Azerbaijan's military.\n\nAnd guess what? Chris Wray and company found that Erik Prince had likely violated U.S. laws on the export of defense articles or services. And they reported it to the Obama Justice Department and the State Department. But then? Nothing. So, what happens now that Chris Wray is FBI director? What happens if Erik Prince gets charged with lying to Congress. Will Chris Wray have to recuse himself?\n\nIt's a strange story and Matthew Cole joins me now to discuss it. Matthew, welcome back to Intercepted.\n\nMatthew Cole: Thanks, Jeremy.\n\nJS: OK, explain the documents that we got and what they say.\n\nMC: Well, we received a few internal documents from Frontier Services Group, which is the Chinese-based company that Erik Prince is the executive chairman of the board, and the documents go back to essentially a story that we did two years ago which were an internal investigation by a law firm into Erik Prince's alleged activities, trying to broker defense sales and deals on his own, or essentially for his own, and identified where Erik Prince had likely violated U.S. laws for defense materiel and defense services and brokering - trafficking, he essentially was trafficking in light-armed attack planes and ideas for a mercenary army.\n\nJS: And the point was that Erik Prince wanted to create these small, paramilitary aircraft that could be used by foreign governments or foreign forces in counterinsurgency operations or in operations to protect the extraction of natural resources by corporations, including national petroleum corporations in some countries.\n\nMC: You know, this story really was a bookend to what we did. We did two stories two years ago about Erik Prince's efforts to sell mercenary outfits, essentially part Air Force, Army, ground forces around the world and what had come out of that was that there was a federal investigation into Erik Prince's efforts to sell those items as well as his contacts with Chinese intelligence and opening up bank accounts for Libyans, which was a very curious and odd story.\n\nBut one of the things that we didn't have an answer for was what had happened to that investigation. And one of the things that came out of the documents that we received recently was that the law firm that did the investigation for Frontier Services Group, King & Spalding, the unit was led by now-FBI director Christopher Wray, and another top Department of Justice official Rob Hur and an Obama administration Justice Department official Gary Grindler.\n\nAnd so, the question becomes: Now that they are in the Trump Administration, if the Prince investigation is still open, if it continues, if it's reopened, what's their role and responsibility? Do they have to recuse themselves? And what is ultimately going to happen to Erik Prince?\n\nJS: So, just to be clear here: In 2015, officials from Frontier Services Group, not Erik Prince, but other officials, start to notice some irregularities or suspicious activity around these paramilitary aircraft and Erik Prince has a long history of sort of using the veneer of, you know, a big established company like Frontier Services group that is a logistics company largely and then trying to cut deals once he's on the ground negotiating that for other things that aren't necessarily Frontier Services Group projects.\n\nSo they discover this stuff. They start to poke at it and they say, huh, Erik Prince may have violated these laws that are very serious, civil penalties up to $500,000 and if there are criminal charges, it can be a million dollars per incident plus up to 20 years in prison. So they hire this powerhouse law firm, King & Spalding, the head of the division, as you say, is now the FBI director, Chris Wray, these other two veteran Justice Department lawyers, one of whom is now Rod Rosenstein's top deputy at the Justice Department, they start looking into this to determine the risk and they say, huh, it looks like Erik Prince likely violated these laws.\n\nThe company then has these lawyers go and brief the Obama Justice Department on what they've discovered about Erik Prince. And, within a few months after they do that there's a huge shuffle at Frontier Services Group, Erik Prince essentially ousts all of the people that were investigating him, consolidates power with his Chinese backers in Hong Kong and then they submit an updated report to the government, according to them, that says nobody did anything wrong. And so that case is closed.\n\nMC: Right, and now that he's back in the limelight because of the Trump Administration and connections to - potential connections to the Mueller investigation and the Seychelles meeting reportedly being a back channel between Russia and Trump, what people forget is that for eight years while the Obama administration was in, he was basically out around the world trying to sell global mercenary services. Once he no longer was running Blackwater and didn't have the American contracts, he went out, door to door, through Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Europe, selling his, what he believes are his services, which is the ability to provide a private air force, a private army, deniable operations for low intensity conflicts around the world. And in doing so, he ended up working with the Chinese and starting a company out of Hong Kong that was focused only on logistics and it was backed by, the single biggest investor is CITIC Group, which is largely a company trying to benefit Chinese development in the third world and that fit nicely with Erik's interests in both resource mining and business opportunities. And this story that we published yesterday is really a bookend to it, which was that it wasn't just the people who he worked with who decided that he had done something illegal or may have done something illegal, but rather a very serious law firm that had come in and been hired by the company and looked into what he had done around the world, but especially in Azerbaijan and determined he likely violated the law.\n\nJS: And Prince though clearly has been emboldened by the election of Donald Trump. His sister, Betsy DeVos is the education secretary, Erik Prince and his mother poured huge sums of money into super PACs backing Donald Trump, and just this past weekend, at his home in Virginia, Erik Prince with Oliver North of Iran-Contra fame, hosted a fundraiser - it was a, I believe, $2,700 admission price fundraiser - for Representative Dana Rohrabacher, Republican of California, who is characterized as being pro-Putin, but Rohrabacher has much more to him than just his recent statements about Russia. He is the guy that claims that he has proof that the Hillary emails, the DNC emails, the Podesta emails were leaked to WikiLeaks and he's been trying to get a meeting with Donald Trump.\n\nRohrabacher also went to Afghanistan in the '80s to fight alongside the mujahideen against the Soviets. Erik Prince, early on in his adult life, worked for Dana Rohrbacher and Rohrbacher has been one of his main sponsors ever since.\n\nMatthew as we wrap up, what is the significance of the fact that Chris Wray, the FBI Director, and Rob Hur, who is now the top deputy to Rod Rosenstein and Donald Trump's pick to be the U.S. attorney for the District of Maryland, why does it matter that these senior officials in the justice system in the U.S. are aware of potential crimes by Erik Prince?\n\nMC: Well, potentially, you know, if the FBI has an open investigation into Erik Prince or opens another an investigation into Erik Prince -\n\nJS: Like if he gets charged with lying to Congress, which some Democrats think he may have in his testimony.\n\nMC: Right but there's also, we have not been told, we have no evidence that the original investigations into potential ITAR violations were ever closed.\n\nJS: ITAR is the rules that govern the export of -\n\nMC: The international trafficking of arms regulations, and essentially it's his defense services and defense materiel efforts abroad, that if that investigation has not ended, if it was still open, the question then becomes if it were to continue or move forward in any way, would the director of the FBI have to recuse himself for Rod Rosenstein's deputy?\n\nThe question is if the Department of Justice were to take a case against Erik Prince to court, whether to indict him, whether or not Rosenstein's deputy would have to recuse himself, what role he might have, or as you say if there were to be charges or an investigation into whether or not Erik Prince lied in his closed testimony to the House Intelligence Committee on the Seychelles meeting, whether either of those two people would have to recuse themselves.\n\nJS: OK. And just to be fair here a spokesperson for Frontier Services Group, who also was acting as a spokesperson for Erik Prince and responding to us for this story said that, \"Any assertion that FSG or Mr. Prince violated any laws in this matter is categorically false.\" It seems as though the current FBI director and another senior Justice Department official disagree with that. We'll see if anything comes of it.\n\nMatthew Cole, thanks for the update.\n\nMC: Thank you.\n\nJS: Matthew Cole is an investigative journalist at The Intercept. He and I have a new piece up at theintercept.com. It's called: \"Before He Was FBI Director, Chris Wray Supervised an Investigation That Found Erik Prince Likely Broke U.S. Law.\"\n\n[Musical interlude.]\n\nJS: By now, everyone has, of course, heard of Cambridge Analytica. That's the UK-based firm that allegedly stole the personal data of 50 million Facebook users. It's the same firm, financed by billionaire Robert Mercer and whose leadership once included Steve Bannon, that claims to have successfully used this data to push Donald Trump into the White House.\n\nThe Guardian newspaper first started reporting on Cambridge Analytica's use of personal data to manipulate electorates a few years ago. Now, it's been revealed that this data was obtained under the false pretense of being part of an academic study. The Intercept reported on this last March.\n\nAnd in the past few days, hours, minutes, there's been total chaos at Facebook. The company's security chief announced that he's leaving the company, though that's reportedly because of fake Russian political ads and not the most recent scandal. Facebook's stocks have taken a beating and there are masses of people saying they are quitting the Facebook platform.\n\nMeanwhile, a former Cambridge Analytica contractor has now gone public and is blowing the whistle on the company's practices and its real strategic mission. That contractor's name is Christopher Wylie, and he's been on TV and radio all across the globe for the past few days.\n\nCambridge Analytica initially denied the stories outright, but a new undercover video released by Britain's Channel 4, catches the CEO of Cambridge Analytica, Alexander Nix, and its managing director, Mark Turnbull, bragging on tape about, among other things, their ability to entrap politicians in foreign elections using bribes and prostitutes.\n\nUndercover Reporter: For example, you're saying, when you are using the girls to introduce to the local, to the local fellow, and you're using the girls for this, like, the seduction. They are not local girls. Not Sri Lankan girls?\n\nAlexander Nix: I wouldn't have thought so. That was just an idea. The Ukrainians did on holiday with us, you know?\n\nUndercover Reporter: Yes. There are very beautiful Ukrainian girls.\n\nAN: They are very beautiful.\n\nUndercover Reporter: Yes.\n\nAN: I find that works very well.\n\nJS: That was Alexander Nix, the CEO of Cambridge Analytica. He's since been suspended from the company. Well, there are a lot of implications on this, potentially for hundreds of millions of people across the world. My colleague at The Intercept Sam Biddle has been tracking this story for some time and he takes us inside the developments and also explains Facebook's response.\n\nSam Biddle: The current controversy around Facebook and Cambridge Analytica centers around 50 million Facebook profiles that were obtained by Cambridge Analytica, they say validly, legitimately, legally; Facebook says in violation of their policies.\n\nThese 50 million profiles were removed from the site very deceptively. People signed up for a third-party Facebook app that was described as being part of a university research program, so they consented maybe to some murky idea of a research program that would collect information about them based on what they had put in their Facebook profiles. They did not know, presumably, that this was going to be then handed off to Cambridge Analytica who was working with this app maker.\n\nCambridge Analytica then fed these profiles into their very complex data-processing system that they use for what's called psychometric modeling, where they will take Joe Schmoe in Florida, and based on his Facebook data - his likes, what he shared, what groups he follows, etc. - they can profile him in terms of political leanings. They can make predictions about whether he is a likely NRA supporter or is someone who's maybe xenophobic or someone who is a big Planned Parenthood supporter, and then on the basis of those predictions, a political campaign will know where to spend their money.\n\nAnd many political campaigns have used Cambridge Analytica for targeting. Ted Cruz used it in the last election, and (laughing), more notably, Donald Trump used it.\n\nOne of the big promises of a company like Cambridge Analytica is if you find the right people to advertise, to target, you can spend less. You don't have to just blanket every swing state, every district with TV ads, radio ads, Facebook ads.\n\nIf you find the exact right people who are vulnerable or susceptible to certain messaging, you can advertise to them, especially through something like Facebook which is made for micro-targeted advertisements.\n\nYou know part of the severity of this scandal depends on how effective you actually think Cambridge Analytica is and how much you buy their claims of being able to reduce any human on the planet to a certain set of psychological criteria. But the idea is that if you have a list of, you know, the following attributes about a person: Where they're from, where they live, where they've lived in the past, what music they like, what food they eat, what websites they visit, what brands they buy, etc., you can from that deduce the rest of their psychological profile, including political leanings. That's what Cambridge Analytica was selling.\n\nSo, Cambridge Analytica started out in elections in smaller countries like Kenya whose elections are not monitored as closely as, say, British or American election that makes international headlines. So, these were sort of used as laboratory settings. At some point, the company's chief executive met with both Robert Mercer, the right-wing billionaire and Steve Bannon. Bannon would later go on to join the company as its vice president; Mercer would later go on to invest $15 million into it. This also brought it into the fold of the conservative American political scene who used it to great effect.\n\nCambridge Analytica partners with a university professor who introduces an app into Facebook's app marketplace that, you know, includes many, many innocuous things like Farmville that are irritating at worst but not typically thought of as part of a data mining operation, right? This app is submitted and described under what now seem to be pretty clearly false pretenses, as being part of a university sociological study of some sort, where, you know, if your data was being handed over you were doing it for the good of some research project.\n\nWhat the app didn't state was the fact that this was being done to siphon data to Cambridge Analytica, not to facilitate a university research program. Something like 200,000 people actually connected the app to their Facebook profiles. But then, from there, the app didn't stop - it continued to script not just their information but the information of their friends, of their entire social network. That is where it balloons up to the 50 million number. Once you start talking about not just 200,000 people, but 200,000 people plus everyone they know, that becomes a really big number really fast.\n\nCarole Cadwalladr: How do you feel about your own involvement in this now? I mean, do you feel responsible for what happened?\n\nChristopher Wylie: Um, yeah. Yeah, I do feel responsible for it.\n\nSB: One of the original employees of Cambridge Analytica, Christopher Wylie, went to the press.\n\nCW: It's incorrect to call Cambridge Analytica a purely, sort of, data science company or an algorithm, you know, company. You know, it is a full-service propaganda machine if you can control all of the streams of information around your opponents, you can influence how they perceive that battle space and you can then influence how they're going to behave and react.\n\nSB: This whistleblower seems to have just been disturbed by what he witnessed, like many whistleblowers are, by how he viewed the company, not just studying but really exploiting people's personal profiles and using their data also to then support right-wing candidates like Ted Cruz and Donald Trump.\n\nCW: It was a grossly unethical experiment because you are playing with an entire country, the psychology of an entire country without their consent or awareness. And not only are you like playing with the psychology of an entire nation, you're playing with the psychology of an entire nation in the context of the democratic process.\n\nSB: I think there might be a certain reckoning that will happen to people, not just to Cambridge Analytica, but throughout the data-mining industry where they stop and think about how this information is being collected and where it's going and sort of reckon with that.\n\nFacebook's posture on the Cambridge Analytica issue has been extremely defensive and outraged, and sort of positioning themselves as also a victim among the 50 million. I think it's a little disingenuous to be that upset by what Cambridge Analytica did when Facebook itself - again, their business model is more or less Cambridge Analytica's business model and on a much vaster scale. I mean, keep in mind, Cambridge Analytica made off with what - 50 million something profiles roughly. There are two billion people using Facebook. So that the scale at which Facebook processes personal information and mines the details of your personal life to then target you with information is orders of magnitude greater than anything Cambridge Analytica did. That's Facebook's business. This is just another company doing it and they made off with Facebook's data.\n\nThere is very little stopping an app that you connect to your Facebook account from doing what this app did on behalf of Cambridge Analytica. If you connect a third-party app to your Facebook account it is entirely possible, depending on the permissions you set, that they have access to everything that was handed over to Cambridge Analytica.\n\nYou know, the difference is that we probably trust the app we use to order takeout a little more than we would trust Cambridge Analytica because they're like something from a James Bond film, but really it's the same data, it's just a matter of how you're using it and whether you trust the holders or not. But the fact is that Facebook did permit this app and allow people to sign up for it and could have stopped it if they had made it a priority to do so, to make sure that this sort of thing couldn't happen. Facebook built a system in which this was possible.\n\nThe lesson learned is that we have essentially no control over what we've spent the past decade-plus putting on to the Internet, under varying conditions. We have lost control and we probably know extremely little of how it's been used and to what ends and to aid whose agenda. I think it would be fair to say that this Cambridge Analytica story is just one data point among many.\n\nJS: That's my colleague at The Intercept, Sam Biddle. He spoke to our producer Jack D'Isidoro.\n\n[Musical interlude.]\n\nJS: Every week on this show, we examine various threads of power and their impact on our society and on everyday people's lives. We talk to journalists, lawmakers, lawyers, activists - about war, about guns, about racism, political hypocrisy. But we've also made a commitment to feature the work and the voices and the words of artists and musicians and poets. These folks play a unique role in our society, particularly at moments like the one that we are currently in.\n\nOne such artist is Dr. Eve Ewing. Well, she's actually much more than an artist. She's a sociologist of education and a writer from Chicago. Her research has focused on racism, social inequality, urban policy and the impact of these forces on American public schools and the lives of young people. She also was a public school science teacher\n\nEve Ewing has a new book out called \"Electric Arches.\" It explores these issues by blending stark realism with the surreal and the fantastic. It's a beautiful collection of Eve's poetry, essay and some of her visual art. And I should say the book itself is really beautiful.\n\nEve Ewing joins me now from Chicago. Eve, welcome to Intercepted.\n\nDr. Eve Ewing: Thanks for having me.\n\nJS: Before we get into this new book, \"Electric Arches,\" I wanted to first ask you because Donald Trump and his allies bring up Chicago so much, and they make it sound like Chicago is the epicenter of this frightening violence in America, just your general response to the way that Chicago is talked about in this moment in time by a specific group of people in this country.\n\nEE: The way I feel about it is that it's very convenient to use Chicago as a symbol that is really, for many people, kind of like an effective dog whistle. It frightens people. It's used in the service of the same kind of rhetoric that we heard in past presidential administrations with things like, you know, welfare queens and crack babies, right? These are racialized images that are meant to inspire fear and loathing in the hearts of Americans and to make them feel as though there's justification for any kind of extreme crackdown, right, that might happen afterward. It has nothing to do with an actual desire to help, or care for, uplift, or support, or nurture, or even listen to people who actually live here, because if it did stem from that genuine desire, there would be so many different kinds of interventions like providing us with more social services and resources, helping us hold our elected officials accountable for our educational system, responding to the Department of Justice and their inquiry into the fact that the Chicago Police Department has longstanding generations, long systemic racism.\n\nBut it's really not about us. It's really about using this symbol as a scary, violent black place that is supposed to inspire fear in the hearts of Americans. And, unfortunately, it works pretty well.\n\nJS: Right and with this whole discussion now about guns in the United States and the school shootings and now so many young people walking out, confronting politicians and political figures, the refrain from the right and from Trump is always: Well, if you care about guns, why aren't you doing anything about Chicago? And the reality is that the overwhelming majority of the gun-related problems in this country are not coming out of Chicago. The problem is that we have a gun culture where people are addicted, and they're largely white males, to stockpiling very high-powered weapons.\n\nEE: You know, people here do fight violence every single day. There are so many community organizers and leaders and educators that not only stand against gun violence, not only actually show up to the vigils of the young people that are lost in our communities all the time, but are attuned to the deeper issues and reasons and committed to the city and committed to actually unpacking the reasons behind this violence.\n\nAgain, you're exactly right, this is really rhetoric, you know, it's using the city as a stand-in for fear. And, you know, I am really, really grateful and moved and excited by the younger folks that are stepping up and speaking out against gun violence. What I really hope is that they can form meaningful coalitions and solidarity between students who are from, you know, wealthier, whiter communities, saying that, \"We don't want this to happen in our community again\" and young people from places like Baltimore places, like Chicago, places where this violence is an everyday reality - those young people want the same things. They want to show up and be safe at school. They want jobs. They want to see a future for themselves.\n\nJS: Now, unlike Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, you've actually spent quite a bit of time in public schools.\n\nEE: Yes, yes I have.\n\nJS: And taught public schools. Her proposal, it's not just hers, but she's now sort of in charge of it, this idea of arming teachers. Your thoughts about that, and sort of what it indicates about the moment we're in?\n\nEE: You know when I was a public school teacher, I spent an average of $100 a week on supplies for my own students, especially because when I started out I was teaching science and I was the only science teacher for the entire middle school, so I had about 170 students, and I was committed to providing them the best inquiry-based science education that I possibly could, which meant I didn't just want them to read about things in textbooks, I wanted them to do all the things that so many of us remember as being the fun things that allow you to see how science actually works and bring it to life. I wanted them to connect circuits. I wanted them to look at things under microscopes, right? And all those things cost money. And I never heard the secretary of education or any of these people out here outraged and wanting to arm me with the actual things that I needed to do my job every week.\n\nAnd so to hear these same folks, in the name of protecting students or protecting lives, talking about how we should arm teachers - you know, many teachers have risen up and said, \"Arm us with pencils. Arm us with nurses. Right? Counselors.\" And I don't think that the teachers of America should have to worry about volunteering their lives or making the decisions between going home to their families that day and sacrificing themselves for the children in their classroom.\n\nJS: Well, and we've also seen videos that young people are posting of staff inside of schools assaulting students.\n\nEE: Absolutely.\n\nJS: And this is not even having a gun. My, my real fear about guns in school is that these altercations where we've seen, you know, staff at schools slamming black children down or putting them in a headlock or restraining them by extreme force or doing other things that may not be physical assault, but are meant to humiliate them in retribution, you know, in revenge for some perceived slight, that now you're going to have some of these hotheads in schools - not necessarily teachers, but other staffers who have guns - and what are those altercations going to look like now if those staffers have guns on them?\n\nEE: You know, we also already have police and these SROs, these security resource officers in schools. You know? There are many, many students in this country that attend schools, that have security or police presence and no counselors to help them get to college. That is despicable.\n\nAnd I think you're right. I think about the children, the black children murdered across this country who will never get to make it to high school because somebody thought they were dangerous. You know, I think about Tamir Rice, I think about Aiyana Stanley, and the idea that we would further introduce that dynamic into schools, a place where children are supposed to feel safe and where many of them already do not, it's just bad policy.\n\nJS : And you wrote this great essay for The Fader that was called \"Black Life and Death In a Familiar America.\"\n\nEE: Oh, thank you for reading that.\n\nJS: We always say on this show that history and context matter, and I think the nuance that you're writing with is really refreshing and really essential. I just want to share with people part of that.\n\nYou were writing about Mount Greenwood, which is a neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago that is different from what you might imagine the way that the South Side of Chicago is talked about. And you write: \"Mt. Greenwood residents became excited at the mere mention of his name, and for a moment the altercation had the tone of a spontaneous campaign rally. They began to chant 'Donald Trump,' and one of them directly addressed the young black woman holding the camera, 'Build that wall! We'll fuckin' put you on the other side, motherfucker!' I watched him through a screen, through another screen, through the eyes of another. I closed my eyes and imagined what it would be like to look at him through a chain link fence.\"\n\nWas this an event that signaled to you that Donald Trump's vision for America was sort of alive and well even in patches of this part of the country in Chicago that's talked about so much before he was even elected?\n\nEE: Thank you. That was a beautiful reading. I really appreciate it.\n\nYeah, so that piece was published the day after the election, and the event that I'm describing there took place before the election.\n\nYou know, during the campaign and then right after he was elected there was a lot of justifiable and understandable, you know, fear, hand-wringing and shock, especially from corners of liberal white America where people thought basically this was a referendum that made them realize that the America that they thought they lived in does not exist, or this election constituted a transformational historical event that somehow gave permission or highlighted, you know, new forms of racism or new forms of xenophobia.\n\nIn no way do I want to undercut what I do think have been some of the uniquely awful aspects of this administration, but I also think it's important for folks to remember that this is not like the man in a laboratory conjuring up these racist people like Frankensteins, who had never existed - you know, Frankenstein monsters that never existed. Rather it is him giving a voice and a platform for an energy behind white supremacy and hatred that has a long history in America and that actually, in my opinion, constitutes the very fabric of the nation.\n\nAnd so I think that that's important to realize, because it makes you understand that in order to conquer or change or transform the kind of hatred and vile evil that we're seeing right now, it's not just about these particular voters, it's not just about this particular election, but we have to be brave enough to confront and understand a history that is much deeper.\n\nJS: I have to say one of my most favorite pieces in your new book, \"Electric Arches\" is the piece called \"The Device.\"\n\nEE: Oh, thank you.\n\nJS: And I just wanted to see if you could maybe read the opening paragraph of it and then carry on with explaining the story.\n\nEE: This is the first paragraph of the short story, \"The Device\": \"It wasn't like a George Washington Carver kind of thing, where one brilliant Negro with a soldering iron made some magic and poof! a miraculous machine. It was an open-source kind of situation. Thousands of high school science-fair whiz kids, this and that engineering club at this and that technical college, the One Black Person at a bunch of Silicon Valley startups getting together with a bunch of other One Black Persons over craft beer and coding late into the night, even some government folks working off the clock (or so the rumors go). Not just one person. A hive mind of Black nerds, obsessive types, scientists, and inventors but also historians and archaeologists and the odd astrologer here and there. Project Delta Mother, they called it (goofy name TBH but it's whatever).\"\n\nSo that's the beginning of this short story, \"The Device.\" The story is about a collective group of black scientists across the country who build this machine and the purpose of the machine is to allow you to communicate with your ancestors. And the story describes the first time that the machine is turned on and the little girl who is selected to be like the test pilot flips the switch and finds herself communicating with her ancestors over space and time. And it doesn't go exactly as everybody thinks it's going to go.\n\nI was invited to give a reading at the Art Institute of Chicago. I was - so I had some time to tour the gallery by myself and check it out, and there was a series of West African masks that were supposed to enable the wearer to basically channel the spirits of their ancestors and so they were used in different rituals and events where somebody would wear them and then they would like embody the spirits of the people that had gone before them. And I thought about what a powerful idea that was for African-Americans, for those of us for whom, you know, our lineage is necessarily cut off by chattel slavery.\n\nI have a tattoo on my right shoulder blade of my matrilineal genealogy, and it goes back to my mom, my grandma, my great-grandma, back to my great, great grandmother who died a free person but was born an enslaved person. And because she's considered property and record keeping is spotty, I don't have any access to the people who came before her. You know, this is something that African-Americans specifically wrestle with a lot in this country, especially as we consider our place in the diaspora and sometimes get messages from other people in the diaspora that, you know, we don't have a real history or that slavery is something we should be ashamed of and it doesn't give us access to kind of a national identity or an understanding of who our ancestors were.\n\nSo I wanted to grapple with that idea and think about, you know, what if we could use science to talk to them. I tried to think about what it actually means to not just consider our ancestors as these like mythical, magical people, but as human beings with their own opinions and thoughts and unexpected quirks. So that's kind of where the story came from.\n\nJS: Yeah, it's a great story.\n\nEE: Thank you.\n\nJS: And I encourage people to read it.\n\nEE: You know, the book overall a lot of it is about like coming of age and black girlhood and black womanhood, with the obvious understanding that those things are not monoliths, right? And so this is like my particular story and my particular life and I hope that some people find things that are true in it and other things maybe not so much.\n\nJS: And one of your inventions is the decoder rings that used to come in cereal boxes and the one that you've cooked up in your imagination allows the wearer to be able to understand what black girls are saying.\n\nEE: Childhood and playfulness are recurring themes in the book and in my own life. The black girl decoder ring is kind of playing with the fact that so much of popular culture is based on this like sort of two-faced desire of black women, where on the one hand there's like a desire to imitate and to copy and to steal beauty and body styles and hairstyles and things like that, but that's also coupled with a disrespect and like invisibility and even disgust with, or like sense of contempt for like actual black women and black women's bodies.\n\nAnd so the decoder ring is sort of like the thing that Taylor Swift or Katy Perry gets to wear that will allow them the thing they most desire, which is to be able to understand and fully access what black women are doing and saying without actually engaging with them as human beings. And I thought about that kind of translational work and the idea of like this cereal box toy that you could get.\n\nJS: Wow. Well, as we wrap up our conversation, I want to encourage everybody to pick up this book by Eve Ewing, which is called \"Electric Arches.\" And Eve has generously offered to share some unpublished poetry with us today, and I'm going to hand the reins over to her to do a short reading here on Intercepted.\n\nEE: So, I'm going to read a poem from a new project that I have coming out in 2019. It's called \"1919,\" and it's about the race riots that happened in Chicago in 1919. The poem I'm going to read is a persona poem, and it's in the voice of a train bringing black people up from the South during the Great Migration to Chicago. And the poem begins with a line from the report that was commissioned by the state to evaluate the causes of the race riot, so that line is: \"The presence of Negroes in large numbers in our great cities is not a menace in itself.\"\n\nThe poem is called, \"The Train Speaks\":\n\n\"Even now, I dream of them. All my babies. Quiet nights in the rail yard when the little feet skitter beneath me, when the last of the strong men with his gleaming silver buttons has locked the door and laid his hands against me, warm palms offering a silent farewell.\n\nI see them dancing in every passing cloud. My babies, my babies born unto me in the hills and green lands, loose threads catching in my sharp parts when they don't watch out, blistered hands hauling parcels of burlap as hefty and shapeless as bound cotton. They move like rabbits then. They look for a lash that isn't there. Even them that never felt it. It's in their shoulders. The lash lives in their shoulders.\n\nLong after the last biscuit is gone when the sunrise brings steel mountains, my children look and look through the space I have made for them. The gift I prepared. They are safe within but can see without. They feel it before they know the words, then smile when it comes to them. It's flat. The land is flat. And they smile to think of it, this new place, the uncle or cousin who will greet them, the hat they will buy, the ribbons. They know not the cold, my babies. They know not the men who are waiting and angry. They know not that the absence of signs does not portend the absence of danger. My innocent children, my precious ones, I can never take you home. You have none. But, oh, if I could keep you here safe in my iron heart, I would never let you go out into the wind.\"\n\nJS: Briefly, Eve, the context of the poem.\n\nEE: The 1919 race riots happened sort of in the still beginning phase of the Great Migration, unprecedented migration in the scale of the United States and much of human history, and brought massive numbers of black people from the South into the industrialized North. And my grandmother moved from Mississippi to the North when she was five years old.\n\nAnd I think that the train has an interesting sort of symbolic resonance in black culture in America, both because the train was often used as like a metaphor for freedom. You know Langston Hughes has a famous poem called \"Freedom Train,\" the Underground Railroad obviously and for many people, the train actually became the real pathway to their freedom.\n\nAnd so I wanted to think about what it meant to regard these folks who came up North from, you know, a warm, lush verdant place where they also were living under the threat of racial terrorism, to a North where they were hoping to find a different life and where there was still violence but a different kind of violence that perhaps they weren't prepared for and I wanted to view them from the perspective of someone that would see them with love and care and nurturing. And the train is that, right? It's this kind of like loving, caring thing that envelops you and shepherds you from one place to the next.\n\nYeah, and so that's the poem. I read it the other day in Battle Creek, Michigan and I could see this elderly woman in the back and like the whole time she was just grinning, and smiling, and like making noise, and celebrating me as I was on stage. And afterwards, she came up and told me that the poem was so amazing and special to her because she remembers coming up North and she remembers being 7 years old. And I said, \"You remember the train?\" She said, \"Oh honey, I remember everything. I remember picking cotton in Mississippi and I remember leaving and we came up here and my uncles went to Chicago and we kept going and we landed here in Battle Creek.\"\n\nAnd so, it's a part of our history that I think is really important and beautiful and also special because our elders are still here to tell us about it. And I think it's important for us to capture it as much as possible. So I'm hoping that, you know, the poem and the book more broadly will invite people to think about a chapter of our history that we often, I think, don't talk about as much as we should but that actually shapes the fabric of the cities and the country that we live in today.\n\nJS: What a great note to end on.

      "text": "How to Love This Freaky Country\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe right loves to accusingly demand, \"Do you love this country?\" We need the confidence to answer, \"I love the parts you're trying to destroy.\"\n\nAmerican progressives can't ever match conservatives in displays of febrile patriotism, and for good reason. What Jesus told his followers about prayer is also good advice about loving a country: \"Thou shalt not be as the hypocrites are, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men.\"\n\nMoreover, anyone who's spent five minutes thinking about human history knows how dangerously volatile nationalism is. This is especially important to keep in mind in a country that has used nuclear weapons and pondered whether to drop tungsten rods on our enemies from orbit .\n\nNonetheless, I believe it behooves all of us to consider and celebrate what is resplendent about the United States of America.\n\nFirst, if you don't do so, you wear blinders that prevent you from seeing a giant chunk of reality. In Catholic theology most souls are of middling virtue - but the ones which are not are generally not good or evil alone but both at once. As St. Augustine put it, \"my two wills, one old and the other new, one carnal, the other spiritual, contend within me.\" The same goes for countries: If they're not in the middle of the bell curve they often occupy both ends simultaneously. That is definitely the United States.\n\nSecond, one of America's most beautiful attributes is that we have freedom and resources that our fellow malcontents in many other countries could only dream of. Pretending that we don't have this wiggle room is - particularly for white activists - to show ourselves to be distastefully spoiled.\n\nThird, being conscious of this country's upside is the only way we'll ever be able to communicate with anyone outside the minute lefty archipelago. The lived experience of millions of Americans has been that it's superior to where their families once came from. Trying to convince them that it's uniformly appalling is like trying to convince them that they have three arms. That's not going to work.\n\nFinally, it's critical for our own psychological wellbeing. Much about America's past has been hideous and much about the present is grim. But keeping that going as an endless interior monologue is a recipe for stasis and failure. Conversely, an appreciation of the glorious parts of the U.S. is motivation to protect and expand them. The right loves to accusingly demand, \"Do you love this country?\" We need the confidence to give the correct answer, which is \"I love the parts you're trying to destroy.\"\n\nSo for July 4, I've made a list of what's most deeply meaningful to me about America.\n\nJennifer Burbank of the Georgetown volunteer fire department, decorates a firetruck with a 48-star U.S. flag donated by longtime Georgetown resident Bernice Plass before the start of the Fourth of July Parade in downtown Georgetown on Friday July, 4, 2003.\n\nPeople Have Rights, Not the Government\n\nFor most of the time in most places, societies believed that the natural order was to have a king who had the final word about everything. The Declaration of Independence was one of the first attempts to flip that on its head, and declare that individual people come first and governments derive their power \"from the consent of the governed.\"\n\nIt's easy to forget the momentousness of this statement in an era when Fortune 500 companies complain that governmental tyranny prevents them from putting arsenic in their line of baby food. But it was a giant step forward, and one of the best parts about being an American is an instinctive understanding of the zaniness of monarchies. For instance, Great Britain pays an old lady from some German family to live in a gigantic house, and if you have dinner there you have to immediately stop eating when she does .\n\nThe Declaration of Independence resonated so deeply with universal human aspirations that it was copied by many other rebellions. Ho Chi Minh used parts of it verbatim in 1945 in a declaration of independence for Vietnam. We were so moved by this that the Eisenhower administration offered France two nuclear bombs to drop on Dien Bien Phu.\n\nSeparation of Church and State\n\nNot only did most places have kings in 1776, it was usually accepted that these kings had been appointed by god. This meant that you couldn't question the king's decisions even when large holes had been eaten in his brain by syphilis.\n\nSo establishing a wall between religion and government in the Bill of Rights was deeply radical and positive. The corporate right has long understood how this levels society, which is why they've quietly supported efforts to tear it down and retcon U.S. history to make the founding fathers fervent Christians.\n\nAnyone From Anywhere\n\nIn most places at most times, nationality has depended on blood and soil. For instance, Korean-Japanese whose families have been there for 100 years are still referred to as zainichi - which literally means \"staying in Japan,\" presumably temporarily. But in theory and to a large degree in fact, anyone can come to the U.S. from anywhere, and when they take the oath of citizenship they become as American as everyone else.\n\nThe Nazis used to call the U.S. a mongrel nation. They were absolutely right; it's fantastic and the source of our hybrid vigor.\n\nWe're So Rich\n\nThe U.S. right likes to tout our enormous wealth as a sign of our success. In reality, it signifies a humiliating failure of our economic system, even leaving aside our stunning levels of inequality.\n\nWe have advantages possessed by no other country in history. We're gigantic, in the temperate zone, overflowing with natural resources, and with neighbors so weak we generally forget that they're there. Yet Europe and Japan are about as rich as we are, despite having few of these assets and regularly destroying themselves in catastrophic wars. We should have twice as much money as they do.\n\nNevertheless, by any reasonable standard the U.S. is an incredibly wealthy place, as wealthy as any country needs to be to maximize human happiness. If we get our act together to fight, we could use our riches to do amazing things.\n\nFor instance, much of our gains in economic productivity over the past 40 years have gone into the pockets of millionaires and billionaires. The median household income in the U.S. now is about $56,500. If flight attendants and firemen had gotten their share of economic growth, they would be making over $70,000. Alternatively - and even more enticingly - if we'd had the power to take our increased productivity in time off regular people could be making their current salaries while only working about 30 hours per week.\n\nWho knows what we'd do with that kind of extra time for ourselves, but it's thrilling to contemplate. If current trends continued there would certainly be a lot of podcasts; once we're only working 15 hours a week and the ratio of podcasts to podcast listeners passes 1:1, we'll have to invent robots to rate and review them on iTunes.\n\nAfrican American and Secular Jewish Culture\n\nI'm not black and, despite the enthusiastic (((feedback))) I receive from the alt-right, I'm also not Jewish. I'm a baptized Episcopalian, a Mischling second degree , and a practicing nothing. But to me, looking at black culture and Jewish culture in America from the periphery, they seem to be humanity's two premiere achievements.\n\nI used to think that William Faulkner's claim that \"man will not merely endure: he will prevail\" was hokey and overoptimistic. But the history of African Americans is evidence he knew what he was talking about.\n\nTwo hundred fifty years of kidnapping, murder, rape and chattel slavery; \"freedom\" followed by 100 years of treatment that was slavery-adjacent; a 10-year window when change seemed possible; and then 40 years of mass incarceration that is intermittent reenslavement. It's incredible African Americans haven't collapsed in exhaustion, or simply perished.\n\nInstead, faced with a 1,000-foot high wall of hate, they've dug tunnels under it, floated over it waving from hot air balloons, and built transporters to dematerialize and then rematerialize on the other side, all to the bafflement and fury of much of white America. We understand violence and in fact rejoice when faced with it, because we know how to respond in kind a hundred times over. What we can't understand is black America's unending eruption of invention - in politics, music, literature, sports, Twitter, general stylishness, and a thousand other areas - that reverberates around the world. It's set a standard of wisdom and humanity for everyone else on earth to aim for.\n\nThe accomplishments of secular Jewish culture in America have been similar, although modulated differently.\n\nAll religions have the same essential precepts, and most religions ignore them in practice. Judaism stands out for sometimes taking them seriously. Both the Torah and Old Testament instruct us that \"Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.\" Only Judaism builds a holiday around this admonition, and sends participants out into the world believing that maybe those words mean what they say.\n\nLikewise, I can't help but love an ethical tradition that requires kids to ask questions . As Rabbi Jonathan Sacks has put it, \"To be a Jewish child is to learn how to question.\" I.I. Rabi, an American Nobel Prize-winning physicist, said he became a scientist because when he came home from school each day his mother would ask him not what he'd learned, but whether he'd asked a good question. Polls have shown that American Jews value \"thinking for oneself\" as the most critical quality to encourage in children.\n\nThe collision of this perspective with the openness of American culture has exploded in every direction. It's impossible to imagine how different, and how much worse, the U.S. would be without the influence of secular Judaism.\n\nThen there's what is, for me, the dazzling summit of African American and Jewish culture: the collaborative creation of American comedy.\n\nComedy of the powerful tends to take this structure: \"Wouldn't it be funny if...\" You can see this clearly in Monty Python, whose main five performers went to Oxford and Cambridge. Wouldn't it be funny if a pet store owner refused to acknowledge a parrot he'd just sold to a customer had died ? Wouldn't it be funny if the head of a mountaineering expedition had double vision ?\n\nBut the comedy of the powerless usually says something else: \"Isn't it funny that...\" The powerless don't need to invent surrealistically absurd situations, they live them. So a Chris Rock joke is: Isn't it funny that that train's never late ?\n\nAnd the comedy of reality will always be superior to the comedy of imagination, no matter how well executed. That's why American comedy, created by African Americans and Jews (with an assist from Irish Catholics) is the current reigning world champion.\n\nOf course, I understand that the individual humans involved in all this did not do so as a hobby or to make America better, but to survive in the face of monstrous cruelty. Billie Holiday would have traded \"Strange Fruit\" for an end to lynchings. Our goal should be to make this country so good that we end up with a bland, Swiss-like pudding of a culture.\n\nBaseball\n\nI can't honestly claim I like baseball that much. But all lists like this by liberals seem to include it, so I feel peer pressure to do so too. You're also supposed to be super into jazz.\n\nSo that's why I love America. I encourage you to think about it yourself today in between the cookout, beach, and fireworks. Writing it down made me feel much better about being alive right here right now, and it could do the same for you.\n\nTop photo: A Liberty Bell float looms high over spectators in the 2015 Fourth of July Parade in Pittsfield, Mass. on Saturday, July 4, 2015.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "Facebook Failed to Protect 30 Million Users From Having Their Data Harvested by Trump Campaign Affiliate\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nSurvey participants did not know that \"likes\" and demographic data from their Facebook profiles were being harvested by political operatives.\n\nIn 2014, traces of an unusual survey, connected to Facebook, began appearing on internet message boards. The boards were frequented by remote freelance workers who bid on \"human intelligence tasks\" in an online marketplace, called Mechanical Turk, controlled by Amazon. The \"turkers,\" as they're known, tend to perform work that is rote and repetitive, like flagging pornographic images or digging through search engine results for email addresses. Most jobs pay between 1 and 15 cents. \"Turking makes us our rent money and helps pay off debt,\" one turker told The Intercept. Another turker has called the work \"voluntary slave labor.\"\n\nThe task posted by \"Global Science Research\" appeared ordinary, at least on the surface. The company offered turkers $1 or $2 to complete an online survey. But there were a couple of additional requirements as well. First, Global Science Research was only interested in American turkers. Second, the turkers had to download a Facebook app before they could collect payment. Global Science Research said the app would \"download some information about you and your network ... basic demographics and likes of categories, places, famous people, etc. from you and your friends.\"\n\n\"Our terms of service clearly prohibit misuse,\" said a spokesperson for Amazon Web Services, by email. \"When we learned of this activity back in 2015, we suspended the requester for violating our terms of service.\"\n\nAlthough Facebook's early growth was driven by closed, exclusive networks at college and universities, it has gradually herded users to agree to increasingly permissive terms of service. By 2014, anything a user's friends could see was also potentially visible to the developers of any app that they chose to download. Some of the turkers noticed that the Global Science Research app appeared to be taking advantage of Facebook's porousness. \"Someone can learn everything about you by looking at hundreds of pics, messages, friends, and likes,\" warned one, writing on a message board. \"More than you realize.\" Others were more blasé. \"I don't put any info on FB,\" one wrote. \"Not even my real name ... it's backwards that people put sooo much info on Facebook, and then complain when their privacy is violated.\"\n\nIn late 2015, the turkers began reporting that the Global Science Research survey had abruptly shut down. The Guardian had published a report that exposed exactly who the turkers were working for. Their data was being collected by Aleksandr Kogan, a young lecturer at Cambridge University. Kogan founded Global Science Research in 2014, after the university's psychology department refused to allow him to use its own pool of data for commercial purposes. The data collection that Kogan undertook independent of the university was done on behalf of a military contractor called Strategic Communication Laboratories, or SCL. The company's election division claims to use \"data-driven messaging\" as part of \"delivering electoral success.\"\n\nSCL has a growing U.S. spin-off, called Cambridge Analytica, which was paid millions of dollars by Donald Trump's campaign. Much of the money came from committees funded by the hedge fund billionaire Robert Mercer, who reportedly has a large stake in Cambridge Analytica. For a time, one of Cambridge Analytica's officers was Stephen K. Bannon, Trump's senior adviser. Months after Bannon claimed to have severed ties with the company, checks from the Trump campaign for Cambridge Analytica's services continued to show up at one of Bannon's addresses in Los Angeles.\n\n\"You can say Mr. Mercer declined to comment,\" said Jonathan Gasthalter, a spokesperson for Robert Mercer, by email.\n\nFacebook Elections signs in the media area at Quicken Loans Arena in Cleveland, Aug. 6, 2015, before the first Republican presidential debate of the 2016 election.\n\nThe Intercept interviewed five individuals familiar with Kogan's work for SCL. All declined to be identified, citing concerns about an ongoing inquiry at Cambridge and fears of possible litigation. Two sources familiar with the SCL project told The Intercept that Kogan had arranged for more than 100,000 people to complete the Facebook survey and download an app. A third source with direct knowledge of the project said that Global Science Research obtained data from 185,000 survey participants as well as their Facebook friends. The source said that this group of 185,000 was recruited through a data company, not Mechanical Turk, and that it yielded 30 million usable profiles. No one in this larger group of 30 million knew that \"likes\" and demographic data from their Facebook profiles were being harvested by political operatives hired to influence American voters.\n\nKogan declined to comment. In late 2014, he gave a talk in Singapore in which he claimed to have \"a sample of 50+ million individuals about whom we have the capacity to predict virtually any trait.\" Global Science Research's public filings for 2015 show the company holding 145,111 British pounds in its bank account. Kogan has since changed his name to Spectre. Writing online, he has said that he changed his name to Spectre after getting married. \"My wife and I are both scientists and quite religious, and light is a strong symbol of both,\" he explained .\n\nThe purpose of Kogan's work was to develop an algorithm for the \"national profiling capacity of American citizens\" as part of SCL's work on U.S. elections, according to an internal document signed by an SCL employee describing the research.\n\n\"We do not do any work with Facebook likes,\" wrote Lindsey Platts, a spokesperson for Cambridge Analytica, in an email. The company currently \"has no relationship with GSR,\" Platts said.\n\n\"Cambridge Analytica does not comment on specific clients or projects,\" she added when asked whether the company was involved with Global Science Research's work in 2014 and 2015.\n\nThe Guardian, which was was the first to report on Cambridge Analytica's work on U.S. elections, in late 2015, noted that the company drew on research \"spanning tens of millions of Facebook users, harvested largely without their permission.\" Kogan disputed this at the time, telling The Guardian that his turker surveys had collected no more than \"a couple of thousand responses\" for any one client. While it is unclear how many responses Global Science Research obtained through Mechanical Turk and how many it recruited through a data company, all five of the sources interviewed by The Intercept confirmed that Kogan's work on behalf of SCL involved collecting data from survey participants' networks of Facebook friends, individuals who had not themselves consented to give their data to Global Science Research and were not aware that they were the objects of Kogan's study. In September 2016, Alexander Nix, Cambridge Analytica's CEO, said that the company built a model based on \"hundreds and hundreds of thousands of Americans\" filling out personality surveys, generating a \"model to predict the personality of every single adult in the United States of America.\"\n\nShortly after The Guardian published its 2015 article, Facebook contacted Global Science Research and requested that it delete the data it had taken from Facebook users. Facebook's policies give Facebook the right to delete data gathered by any app deemed to be \"negatively impacting the Platform.\" The company believes that Kogan and SCL complied with the request, which was made during the Republican primary, before Cambridge Analytica switched over from Ted Cruz's campaign to Donald Trump's. It remains unclear what was ultimately done with the Facebook data, or whether any models or algorithms derived from it wound up being used by the Trump campaign.\n\nIn public, Facebook continues to maintain that whatever happened during the run-up to the election was business as usual. \"Our investigation to date has not uncovered anything that suggests wrongdoing,\" a Facebook spokesperson told The Intercept.\n\nFacebook appears not to have considered Global Science Research's data collection to have been a serious ethical lapse. Joseph Chancellor, Kogan's main collaborator on the SCL project and a former co-owner of Global Science Research, is now employed by Facebook Research. \"The work that he did previously has no bearing on the work that he does at Facebook,\" a Facebook spokesperson told The Intercept.\n\nChancellor declined to comment.\n\nCambridge Analytica has marketed itself as classifying voters using five personality traits known as OCEAN - Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism - the same model used by University of Cambridge researchers for in-house, non-commercial research. The question of whether OCEAN made a difference in the presidential election remains unanswered. Some have argued that big data analytics is a magic bullet for drilling into the psychology of individual voters; others are more skeptical . The predictive power of Facebook likes is not in dispute. A 2013 study by three of Kogan's former colleagues at the University of Cambridge showed that likes alone could predict race with 95 percent accuracy and political party with 85 percent accuracy. Less clear is their power as a tool for targeted persuasion; Cambridge Analytica has claimed that OCEAN scores can be used to drive voter and consumer behavior through \"microtargeting,\" meaning narrowly tailored messages. Nix has said that neurotic voters tend to be moved by \"rational and fear-based\" arguments, while introverted, agreeable voters are more susceptible to \"tradition and habits and family and community.\"\n\nDan Gillmor, director of the Knight Center at Arizona State University, said he was skeptical of the idea that the Trump campaign got a decisive edge from data analytics. But, he added, such techniques will likely become more effective in the future. \"It's reasonable to believe that sooner or later, we're going to see widespread manipulation of people's decision-making, including in elections, in ways that are more widespread and granular, but even less detectable than today,\" he wrote in an email.\n\nDonald Trump throws a hat to supporters during a campaign rally on Sept. 15, 2015, in Los Angeles.\n\nTrump's circle has been open about its use of Facebook to influence the vote. Joel Pollak, an editor at Breitbart, writes in his campaign memoir about Trump's \"armies of Facebook 'friends,' ... bypassing the gatekeepers in the traditional media.\" Roger Stone, a longtime Trump adviser, has written in his own campaign memoir about \"geo-targeting\" cities to deliver a debunked claim that Bill Clinton had fathered a child out of wedlock, and narrowing down the audience \"based on preferences in music, age range, black culture, and other urban interests.\"\n\nClinton, of course, had her own analytics effort, and digital market research is a normal part of any political campaign. But the quantity of data compiled on individuals during the run-up to the election is striking. Alexander Nix, head of Cambridge Analytica, has claimed to \"have a massive database of 4-5,000 data points on every adult in America.\" Immediately after the election, the company tried to take credit for the win, claiming that its data helped the Trump campaign set the candidate's travel schedule and place online ads that were viewed 1.5 billion times. Since then, the company has been de-emphasizing its reliance on psychological profiling.\n\nThe Information Commissioner's Office, an official privacy watchdog within the British government, is now looking into whether Cambridge Analytica and similar companies might pose a risk to voters' rights. The British inquiry was triggered by reports in The Observer of ties between Robert Mercer, Cambridge Analytica, and the Leave.EU campaign, which worked to persuade British voters to leave the European Union. While Nix has previously talked about the firm's work for Leave.EU, Cambridge Analytica now denies that it had any paid role in the campaign.\n\nLeave.EU signage is displayed in London on March 5, 2016.\n\nIn the U.S., where privacy laws are looser, there is no investigation. Cambridge Analytica is said to be pitching its products to several federal agencies, including the Joint Chiefs of Staff. SCL, its parent company, has new offices near the White House and has reportedly been advised by Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser, on how to increase its federal business.

Reflecting on Beacon, Zuckerberg attributed part of Facebook's success to giving \"people control over what and how they share information.\" He said that he regretted making Beacon an \"opt-out system instead of opt-in ... if someone forgot to decline to share something, Beacon went ahead and still shared it with their friends.\"\n\nSeven years later, Facebook appears to have made the same mistake, but with far greater consequences.

And not only on the Right.\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe only thing more predictable than riots in the United States' dilapidated cities is the outpouring of moralizing pseudo-explanations that accompany them. In this, as in so much else, Ferguson has been no exception. Between riffs on the venerable trope of \"outside agitators,\" commentators groping for an explanation of the uprising have seized on another, equally well-established mythology: the idea of a culture of poverty among black Americans.\n\nRacists began blowing on this particular dog-whistle as soon as the murder of Michael Brown began to attract national attention. No doubt in the coming months it will only get louder. As the sheer scale and brutality of racial inequality in the US comes, however hazily, into popular focus, conservatives across the country will, much like Zionists suddenly concerned with the fate of the Syrian uprising, suddenly evince an intense preoccupation with the lives of black Americans. We will hear how welfare has made blacks dependent on the government, has broken up the black family, and has encouraged a culture of criminality and violence (as evidenced by all that rap music).\n\nVariations on that basic narrative have, of course, become the norm in the language favored by the Right whenever it's confronted with questions of racism. But the influence of the culture of poverty thesis extends far beyond the ranks of Republican officials, Tea Party activists, and Fox News talking heads - apparent, for instance, in the near-universal tendency to turn any discussion of the pervasive inequalities and discrimination suffered by African Americans into a moralizing sermon about the cultural pathologies of black people.\n\nThe New York Times led the way in this regard, sagely informing its readers that Brown was \"no angel\" and detailing accusations that he had committed petty theft and fought with his family. The article went on to say that Brown \"lived in a community that had rough patches, and he dabbled in drugs and alcohol. He had taken to rapping in recent months, producing lyrics that were by turns contemplative and vulgar. He got into at least one scuffle with a neighbor.\"\n\nEven in those venues where this kind of attack on the character of a murdered young black man is recognized for the victim blaming it is, there is a reticence to directly confront the larger claims the culture of poverty theory makes about African-American culture. One can find any number of articles responding to the latest coded racism from the loud Republican of the moment, which point out how conservatives ignore the history of racial oppression and blame the black poor for their own suffering. Far more rare, however, is a direct confrontation with the description of black culture entailed by the culture of poverty narrative.\n\nThis is ironic, because every aspect of that narrative has been subjected to withering criticism by social scientists over the last thirty years. It is not simply that the aspects of black culture that the narrative identifies have been shaped by structural forces like racism; for the most part, they either don't exist at all, or else are reflective of norms and values that are commonplace in the United States - and are not, therefore, unique features of the \"black community.\" Every component of the culture of poverty narrative is a phantasm, a projection of racial fantasies on to the culture of African Americans, which has for several centuries now served as the screen on which the national unconscious plays out.\n\nPut more bluntly, they are lies.\n\nTake, for example, the claim that black youth inhabit a culture that venerates criminality, in which having been incarcerated is a matter of pride. This particular trope has seen heavy circulation in the last few years, trotted out to rationalize every death of a young black man at the hands of the police or vigilantes. Constructed out of a conglomeration of supposedly \"thuggish\" photos, snatches of rap lyrics, or social media ephemera, it works to make respectable the narrative that, in every case, it was the black teenager who threw himself in a fury at the men with guns. Confronted with such deep-seated criminality, the pundits innocently ask, what else were the police supposed to do?\n\nEthnographies of returned prisoners and their families reveal a very different world, one that coincides more with the commonsense notion that people who already face discrimination in the labor market would hardly celebrate events, like incarceration, that will make their lives even harder. Donald Braman spent four years conducting interviews with prisoners, ex-prisoners, and their families in the Washington, DC, area, and found that black families regarded incarceration with anything but pride.\n\nInstead, he found a pervasive sense of shame. Families of those in prison hid the truth from even their extended family, and went to great lengths to conceal the fact from their social circles. In interviewing close to fifty families, Braman reported that not one was \"out\" as having a member in prison to their entire extended family. Reading the stories he collects, one gets a sense of a suffocating stigma, a desperation not to be associated with the prison system in any way.\n\nIn light of Braman's work, the claim that young black men are happy to be locked up is perverse. There is no culture of criminality in black communities. Convenient as it may be to ascribe one to the victims of state violence, all of the evidence suggests that black families work incredibly hard to keep their members out of prison, and feel a profound sense of failure when they are unable to. In fact, compared with white families, black families place an even greater emphasis on following the rules and obeying authority . Given the disproportionate consequences black youth face for their transgressions, this differential is hardly surprising. Yet the disseminators of this lie persist, attempting to convince the nation that African Americans are (\"culturally, not biologically!\" they hasten to add) simply unable to assess even the most brutally obvious consequences of their actions on their lives.\n\nThe disconnect between claims of a culture of criminality and the evidence presented by reality is not at all unusual when it comes to the various elements that make up the culture of poverty narrative. Its other facets are equally guilty of inverting the world in which we live. Consider three prominent claims made by the would-be augurs of black culture: that black students devalue education out of a conception of school as a white thing, that black parents place a low value on marriage and a stable family life, and that the black poor are simply uninterested in finding work. All of these have been given voice across the political spectrum, from liberals to reactionaries, and all of them are patently false.\n\nThe notion of a black disdain for school as a \"white thing\" has been given voice recently by Barack Obama himself. Giving an address for his neoliberal \"My Brother's Keeper\" program, Obama took the opportunity to opine that in black communities \"there's been the notion of 'acting white,' \" where high-achieving black students are stigmatized by their peers. Obama was relatively restrained in his invocation of \"acting white theory,\" as it's called, confining himself to the assertion that it exists and is wrong, insofar as doing well in school does not compromise one's racial authenticity.\n\nThe very fact, however, that the president felt the phenomenon was important enough to comment on suggests that he thought black attitudes on this question were skewed enough to warrant correction. Other commentators have been even bolder in their use of the theory, trotting it out to explain that black attitudes, and not white racism, are the cause of black-white educational disparities.\n\nDespite its ubiquity in popular discussions, however, acting white theory has come under sustained criticism from education scholars. As social scientists have attempted to test the theory, they have found over and over that black and white students' attitudes on education do not differ substantively. Black students, just like their white counterparts, express a desire to do well in school, and report higher self-esteem when they succeed.\n\nIn fact, recent research by Ivory Toldson suggests that it is white male students who express the most ambivalence about the impact of good grades on their social standing. By contrast, 95% of black female students reported that, if they did really well in school, they would be proud and tell all of their friends about it. Similarly, black students were most likely to report that their friends would be happier if they went to college than if they didn't. Most white students said their friends wouldn't care either way.\n\nIn light of this body of research, the attempt to pin responsibility for educational inequality on black students themselves is beyond perverse. Black students, understandably, place a higher premium on education than white students, because they know they will pay a higher price for lacking it than white students will. Yet the aspirations of black students, however well-documented, fail to make any impact on discussions of race and education in national media. White talking heads (and black conservatives, it must be said) feel no qualms whatsoever about loudly condemning the youth of an entire race for lacking ambition, while remaining criminally silent themselves on the structures that actually frustrate black students' real and dearly-held ambitions.\n\nThe story is, if anything, even nastier when it comes to marriage and the family. Lamentations over the decline of the black family, in particular, are something of a national ritual in the United States, and have been for decades. In the inner city, we are told, there is a culture of single parenting, and having children with multiple partners. From here, descriptions of that culture frequently veer into the luridly racist, with \"broodmares\" being one epithet of choice for black mothers. This culture is then held to be at the root of any number of problems, as absent fathers are blamed for black children doing poorly in school or getting in trouble, and mothers dependent on welfare programs inducing a \"culture of dependency\" in their children.\n\nOnce again, this narrative is profoundly mistaken. Historically, as Herbert Gutman pointed out decades ago, black Americans have placed a tremendous value on maintaining family structures, and have actually had a lower divorce rate than white Americans. Since the 1960s, it's true that single-parent households have become far more common in black communities (though not only there), and this is the era commentators typically focus on, blaming the loss of a mythological united community under Jim Crow in more liberal versions of the story, or welfare programs in more reactionary ones. Both, however, see a transformation in black attitudes as central.\n\nBut social scientists working on family structures, however, have found that variables like the ratio of employed men to women are far stronger predictors of what families look like than attitudes are. When the supply of employed, non-incarcerated men is controlled for, black and white marriage rates look more similar than different.\n\nAttitudes towards marriage also display no great divergence between black and white Americans. Most black Americans value marriage highly, though, as is the case with whites, men tend to value it more highly than women. This last datum is particularly ironic, given the pervasive scapegoating of black men for supposedly abandoning their children after conception. In fact, as numerous studies have found, black fathers maintain high levels of contact with their children even when not co-habitating with the child's mother, and express a strong desire to be even more present in their children's lives. Even more significantly, as Kathryn Edin has noted , \"African Americans' higher valuation of marriage relative to that of whites narrows the racial gap in marriage.\" Black culture is responsible for the gap in marriage rates being smaller than it otherwise would be, not larger.\n\nWith this in mind, the recurrent political fantasy of addressing inequality in the US through marriage promotion programs aimed at the black poor in particular is a sick joke. If people like Sam Brownback, who wrote one of the most recent such proposals , actually cared about the marriage rate among poor black Americans, he would address himself to ending things like mass incarceration and the endemic joblessness in American cities, which all the evidence suggests play a massive role in disrupting black attempts to form stable nuclear families. The irony, of course, is that his preferred alternative is predicated on attempting to sell something to African Americans that they have been trying for literally centuries to buy at a price higher than he could possibly imagine.\n\nOne final component of the culture of poverty, and in some ways the most central, is the myth that the black unemployed simply don't want to find work. This was given particularly vulgar voice recently by Samuel \"Joe the Plumber\" Wurzelbacher, whose relentless self-promotion is indeed a monument to what hard-working white ethnics, with the help of a complicit media, can achieve. Commenting on the protesters in Ferguson, he suggested that the best way to disperse the demonstrators would be to hold a job fair, at the sight of which they would \"scatter like leaves.\" Though the sheer contempt for the black poor may be more visible in Wurzelbacher's quip than in other instances, in substance it doesn't differ in the least from Republican wunderkind Paul Ryan's pronunciation that inner city men simply don't appreciate the value of work.\n\nThis conceit has suffered perhaps more thorough rebuttal than any other component of the culture of poverty. Since the 1960s, social scientists have produced study after study demonstrating that poor and unemployed black Americans have basically the same attitudes towards work as the rest of country. In fact, a recent study found that black job seekers are even more resilient than their white counterparts, staying in the job market longer despite persistent frustrations of their search for employment. One waits in vain for such results to generate a moral panic over the decline of a work ethic in white communities.\n\nWhen it comes to the notion of welfare dependency, the verdict is much the same. One study looking at black single mothers in Milwaukee found that these women's families were a major contributor to the high value they placed on education and finding a career. Far from being the transmission belt of a \"culture of dependency,\" black families act as a support network encouraging their members to achieve as much as possible. The same study found that women on welfare, almost to a person, \"hated it\" and wished they could leave the program. However, the demands of childcare, combined with a lack of job opportunities, ensured that leaving was difficult for most.\n\nOther studies have found similar results, with welfare being largely stigmatized in black communities. In fact, a number of studies have found that people on welfare, black Americans included, feel that people take advantage of the system and receive benefits when they should not. Here, the constant demonization of people on welfare has had an effect on welfare recipients themselves. While attributing their own use to structural factors such as discrimination and joblessness, they attribute others' use of the system to laziness (importantly, however, this suspicion does not carry over into political support for attacks on welfare state, which are consistently opposed by people receiving benefits). The distance from the popular portrayal of black communities content to remain on the dole could not be clearer.\n\nAll of this is to suggest that the constant projections onto some kind of collective black psyche obscures the fact that African Americans and white Americans are motivated by much the same things. Still, the absence of evidence for their existence hasn't prevented these tropes of black cultural pathologies from entering into nearly every discussion of \"race relations\" in recent years. Indeed, belief in a black culture of poverty has become so entrenched that it is accepted without question for the most part. The prevalence of those assumptions are inseparable from the dominance of a politics that rejects structural solutions for the social disparities and entrenched discrimination facing African Americans, in favor of an emphasis on community self-help and personal responsibility.\n\nThus, we find ourselves in a situation in which public discussion of problems related to high rates of joblessness, child poverty, infant mortality, and many negative social indicators among African Americans is largely restricted to exhortations for a transformation of behavioral norms and attitudes. Instead of a political agenda to deal with pervasive disparities in wealth, educational opportunities, access to employment, and the like, we're told that upward mobility for African Americans depends on the inculcation of values that promote success; black communities, this approach suggests, must learn to celebrate family, encourage hard work, and embrace education.\n\nNot full employment but individual initiative and a commitment to advancement through low-wage work and job training will boost chronically low employment levels. Not a substantial program of redistributive reforms but incentives to encourage entrepreneurship will boost the resources of the black community. Not strengthened anti-discrimination measures or equal access to health care but altered lifestyle choices, better parenting, and the influence of positive role models will reduce health disparities and improve social outcomes for black kids.\n\nImplicit in all this is the idea that if African Americans have failed to overcome the racial stratification of American society, the reason is to be found - at least in large part - in the cultural and psychological character of the black community. The result has been the diffusion of a language around \"race\" that mirrors the \"color-blind\" racism associated with the post-Civil Rights era - a language that simultaneously downplays the significance of actual discrimination while stigmatizing African Americans for behaviors that go unremarked upon in the case of white Americans.\n\nIt is, for instance, not uncommon for conversations that are ostensibly addressing issues like mass incarceration and police violence to devolve into criticism of the dressing habits of young black men or the hedonism and violence in rap lyrics. The double standard at work here should be obvious: no one, for instance, questions whether the predilection of white teenagers for personal attire that can range from the bizarre to the obscene shouldn't make them the objects of scrutiny by police or potential employers. Bill Cosby's rant attacking black Americans for everything from the linguistic habits of black teenagers to the names given to black children was treated by everyone from Barack Obama to Bill O'Reilly as a serious call for self-reflection by the \"black community.\" Yet it would be impossible to imagine a situation in which the personal appearance and lifestyle choices of attendees at the annual Burning Man festival would ever inspire such anxiety.\n\nThe upshot is that even sympathetic observers tend to interpret concerns about deprivation and social disorganization through the prism of cultural or psychological damage. That dynamic is particularly evident in our proclivity to attribute problems like crime or violence in black neighborhoods to ill-defined features of black men's emotional existence. As a consequence, responsibility for these issues is commonly attributed to such causes as a lack of self-regard among African-American males, their purportedly nihilistic and myopic worldview, or their orientation on short-term, narrowly self-interested gain over long-term ambition and social uplift.\n\nThat tendency to speculate about the emotional or psychological state of young black men is emblematic of the way that \"race\" functions in America. In translating discussions of questions like crime and violence into explorations of group psychology, we effectively shift the focus from the social context for street violence in lower-income, predominantly black urban areas to the character of black people. That not only reinforces a blame-the-victim politics that refuses to acknowledge racism - embodied in the cynical use of the category \"black on black crime\" to dismiss concerns about police violence during the Ferguson protests - it also leads to a distorted view of the sources of elevated violence and chronic insecurity in black neighborhoods.\n\nPart of the reason that the trope of \"black on black crime\" has garnered such traction is because it feeds on very genuine concerns about issues like the high levels of violence crime suffered by some black communities. While homicide rates have declined precipitously across the US over the past two decades, the devastating number of shooting deaths suffered by black residents in cities like Chicago has received national attention in recent years. Confronted with the destructive effects of gun violence, many observers have interpreted it as a reflection of deep-seated social pathologies - the inverse of the racism of the US criminal justice system.\n\nResearch suggests that violent crime rates are driven by a variety of social factors which tend to make American cities particularly prone to gun violence against black residents. Among the most of these factors are very high levels of neighborhood segregation, concentrated un- and underemployment , poverty and a dearth of adequate social services or institutional resources . Fundamentally, gun violence has to be treated like other kinds of public health problems - not as the basis for continuous, empty calls for an introspective discussion about \"black on black violence.\" And like other kinds of public health disparities , tackling high rates of inter-personal violence requires confronting the social context in which it occurs.\n\nAnd yet, the culture-of-poverty narrative leads us away from that perspective, and exacerbates the widespread tendency to view social inequality through the lens of personal responsibility and cultural predispositions.\n\nGiven that the culture of poverty argument today is most strongly associated with the Right, it is surprising to learn that its provenance actually comes from the other end of the spectrum. The phrase itself achieved notoriety with Daniel Patrick Moynihan's famous report on the black family (\" The Negro Family: The Case for National Action \"), though he had himself drawn it from anthropologist Oscar Lewis' work. In the decades since then, as \"the Moynihan report\" has, quite properly, come to serve as shorthand on the Left for a pathologization of the black family and a victim-blaming rhetoric, it has been easy to forget that Moynihan himself was no Strom Thurmond, but a Great Society liberal with impeccable credentials. The concept itself comes not from the Right, which was then still mired in explicitly biological racism, but from liberals cognizant of the injustice of inequality, but too attached to ideas of black deficiency to jettison them entirely.\n\nAs American liberalism has moved steadily rightward since the 1970s, versions of the culture-of-poverty thesis have gained increasingly traction. In Moynihan's time, these sorts of ideas were counterbalanced by a liberalism that genuinely sought the expansion of the American welfare state. Hubert Humphrey, running for president in 1968, promised to hire a teacher for every policeman Richard Nixon wanted to hire, and build a house for every jail George Wallace wanted to build. By the 1990s, this sort of commitment had nearly disappeared from American liberalism, leaving culture of poverty arguments hegemonic. The importance of the culture-of-poverty approach is that it allows for recognition of the accumulated history of racism and inequality, but posits the ongoing effects of these as mediated through black cultural pathologies. It therefore permits American liberals to identify with opposition to racism while pushing them towards policy solutions geared towards the transformation of black people, and not American society.\n\nToday, these ideas are given voice by all manner of actors residing left of center on the political spectrum. Barack Obama's few engagements with the subject of racial inequality all draw on the idea of a culture of poverty, even if never explicitly named as such, from his condescending hectoring of black fathers to his gross suggestion that too many black parents feed their children fried chicken for breakfast. Jonathan Chait has also recently revealed himself to be an adherent, criticizing Ta-Nahesi Coates' recent writing for being insufficiently attentive to the deficiencies of black culture.\n\nThe Reverend Al Sharpton gave a particularly abhorrent reminder that conservatives have no monopoly on the culture of poverty at Michael Brown's funeral. In his eulogy , Sharpton lectured the assembled audience on the need for greater personal responsibility in the black community: \"We have got to be outraged by our disrespect for each other, our disregard for each other, our killing and shooting and running around gun-toting each other,\" he said, \"so that they're justified in trying to come at us because some of us act like the definition of blackness is how low you can go. . .\" In contrast to earlier generations of African Americans, who were presumably more worthy of equal rights, black people today exhibit a proclivity for bad behavior and bad manners, Sharpton said, concluding \"Now, you want to be a n-- and call your woman a 'ho.' You've lost where you're coming from.\"\n\nFor many on the Left, it's easy to recognize how backwards and self-defeating this kind of rhetoric can be. In shifting the locus of responsibility for the deep-seated inequities of American capitalism to the very people who are the victims of its greatest injustices, Sharpton is playing into the hands of the white conservatives who so often attack him for playing the \"race card.\"\n\nAnd yet the notion that the entrenched racial disparities of US society are, at least in part, the product of black cultural pathologies, retains enormous traction. Sharpton and Cosby are hardly alone among black Americans in identifying with versions of this narrative. A recent survey , for example, revealed that black men both tend to value education and work highly, yet thought that other black men spent too much time thinking about sports and sex. So pervasive is this ideology that people who know it to be false of themselves are willing to believe it of others. The argument can also take a more nationalist register, as in the contention that slavery damaged black American culture so profoundly that the resulting cultural deficiencies, often identified as a lack of community or self-respect, explain aspects of black inequality today, from educational disparities to economic impoverishment.\n\nForty years ago, both black nationalism and American liberalism existed in forms that looked squarely at the basic structure of American society for an explanation of racial inequality. The shift of both these ideologies away from that orientation in subsequent decades is in line with the larger retreat of the Left away from structural solutions and into more local and personalized projects. Effectively, the Left's horizons have shrunk in tandem with its social power.\n\nWhen it comes to race, however, this retreat has had particularly pernicious effects. The shrinking of ambition to the personal level here has resulted in a convergence with the kinds of victim-blaming narratives peddled in official \"colorblind\" ideology. When liberals or black nationalists agree that black crime contains some larger meaning about the state of the black community, they make the work of racist ideologues easier. They reinforce the basic point that black crime must be agonized over as a barometer of the cultural values of the race, while white crime may be treated as a normal aspect of a complex society.\n\nIn doing so, they give succor to those who seek to block any attempt at addressing the real causes of racial inequality, while rendering half-hearted and tenuous those attempts still being launched from within American liberalism itself. And all on the basis of ideas that, for all liberals' supposed commitment to reason and moderation, are no more connected with reality than birther fantasies.\n\nLike so many other \"zombie ideas\" in our current moment, the culture of poverty narrative persists not because of its success in explaining reality, but in spite of it. What it does succeed in doing is providing an explanation of reality that salves the consciences of the powerful and their supporters. Unfortunately, in an era when collective action by the oppressed is still far too sporadic and ephemeral, these kinds of explanations have sunk deep roots, into both layers of left-liberal opinion and oppressed groups themselves.\n\nYet what the social science literature demonstrates is that however secure the culture of poverty seems as a hegemonic explanation for racial inequality, it ultimately rests on what are, at the end of the day, nothing more than lies. As the uprising in Ferguson has highlighted the connection between American imperialism and militarism on the home front, it is worth remembering that cultural explanations of structural processes have never been a purely domestic affair.\n\nCommenting on the horrific death toll of the Vietnamese during the American war on Vietnam, William Westmoreland infamously explained to an interviewer that \"the Oriental doesn't put the same high price on life as does a Westerner. Life is plentiful. Life is cheap in the Orient.\" For a long time, this remark epitomized the racism of the war. We should view cultural explanations of inequality with the same contempt.\n\nPaul Heideman holds a PhD in American studies from Rutgers University-Newark.\n\nJonah Birch is a visiting assistant professor in sociology at Appalachian State University and a contributing editor at Jacobin .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

But while Krug's persona was certainly offensive, what's far more offensive is that there is a demand for this kind of performance in liberal academic circles.\n\nJessica Krug, aka \"Jess La Bombalera,\" is a white academic from Kansas City, Missouri who claimed to be black and from \"el barrio.\" (Photo by Samira Rashid/Embassy of Haiti)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nI don't know George Washington University history professor Jessica Krug. I have no special insights into either her motives or personal struggles, nor do I have any reason to feel personally betrayed by the recent revelations that she had been passing for black for many years.\n\nBut while the court of public opinion has already found her guilty of at least one, perpetual count of \"cultural appropriation,\" in my view this conclusion misses the mark. To be clear, if I did not find \"Jess La Bombalera\" offensive, I wouldn't have bothered writing this essay. Still, if one considers, first, that culture - the folk's shared sensibilities informed by common experiences - exists, on some level, to be appropriated, second, the variety of black experiences precludes the existence of a singular black culture, and third, the implications for mass culture of thirty-years of mainstream hip hop, then calling Krug's performance \"appropriation of black culture\" only compounds the problem Krug personifies.\n\nIf Krug is not guilty of appropriating \"black culture,\" she is guilty of attempting to establish her bona fides as a scholar of black people through a persona that both pandered to and reinforced commonplace stereotypes about black and brown people. Simply put, Krug was a minstrel act, a racist caricature.\n\nBut while Krug's persona was certainly offensive, what's far more offensive is that there is a demand for this kind of performance in some liberal academic circles.\n\nBecause I've lived most of my life either on the near periphery or within academia, I've had nearly four decades of experience with the creepy essentialist language of \"racial authenticity\" that lives and thrives in more than one corner of putatively liberal academia. As a result, I learned a long time ago that some white liberals expect black and brown people to \"perform\" in ways that comport with their well-meaning, usually underclass-informed, and fundamentally racist expectations of black people.\n\nTo be sure, the phenomenon of which I speak is not confined to academia. Consider for a moment, Barack Obama's inspirational story. Liberal pundits and politicians alike, celebrated Obama as a kind of underclass-informed, Horatio Alger success story. Indeed, liberals like Chris Matthews and Senator John Kerry insisted that Obama could speak frankly to young black boys and men about the cultural impediments to their progress, because he knew them first-hand.\n\nBefore ascending to the US Senate and ultimately the White House, we were told, young Barack struggled with anger, questioned the value of education, and experimented with drugs, partly because he, like so many other African American boys, had been abandoned by his black father.\n\nOf course, the sketch of Obama's life told a different story than the details. President Obama's parents met in college, not the club; Obama's father abandoned him and his mother to attend graduate school at Harvard, not because he had to do a bid in prison; Obama's grandparents did help raise him, but in a solidly middle-class household; and Obama may have struggled with the value of education while smoking \"reefer,\" but he did so while attending one of Hawaii's most prestigious prep-schools.\n\nObama was an appealing black presidential candidate, then, not just because he was well-credentialed, smart, and charismatic. Obama affirmed a fantasy embraced by a stratum of white liberals that presumed a post-racial America had eliminated structural impediments to black economic mobility. The major obstacle to black progress, according to this account, were blacks themselves. Of course, this self-affirming project required shoehorning Obama's personal story into a primetime TV-friendly version of a John Singleton film.\n\nWhile much ink has been spilled on explorations of black angst about the frequently acknowledged fact that some white liberals and even conservatives like \"their blacks\" to share the same class sensibilities, we rarely consider the equally true fact that some white liberals, and even conservatives, like \"their blacks\" to fulfill their fantasies about the forever unknowable, forever exotic black other. That's what \"so and so isn't really black\" is partly illustrative of.  This is what's driving the demand for essays and memoirs on \"black rage.\" And this was also, very clearly, a critical component of Jessica Krug's academic market niche.\n\nHowever offensive Krug's act is - and it is very offensive because it was a front - the demand for her performance is even more offensive. Indeed, the demand for the product Krug was selling merits far more attention than she does. Why? Well, Krug may have done damage to some people herself. But some of the people who bought her performance of blackness will continue to do damage to black and brown people, precisely because Krug tailored her racist performance to mesh with her intended professional audience's racist presumptions about \"black authenticity\" - whatever that might be.\n\nThe sensibilities that fuel the quest for racial authenticity pose real threats not just to the mental health of black and brown people. They pose a threat to democracy itself. I suppose the damaging consequences associated with this kind of racial essentialism are most obvious, though, if you call the baseline problem what it is: an embrace of racist stereotyping, albeit by another name.\n\nBy definition, such stereotyping denies black (and brown) people complexity and, by extension, their humanity - whatever the intentions of the offenders.\n\nTouré F.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIn the fall of 1947, the Eagle Rock Council for Civic Unity scheduled a talk by Langston Hughes to be held at Occidental College's eight-hundred-seat Thorne Hall on March 31, 1948. But days before Hughes was scheduled to arrive on campus, the Los Angeles college's board of trustees hastily called a meeting and canceled his talk.\n\nHughes was one of America's most well-known black writers, with many volumes of poetry, short stories, magazine articles, radio scripts, a Broadway play, a Broadway musical, a Hollywood screenplay, song lyrics, and a popular newspaper column under his belt. But this was the dawn of McCarthyism, and when the trustees looked at Hughes, all they saw was a Red.\n\nThe incident illustrates how the insidious post-World War II Red Scare worked. In a period of escalating tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union, conservative politicians, newspapers, and others sought to frighten people into thinking that Communists were brainwashing Americans and subverting our democracy by infiltrating key institutions - chiefly labor unions, Hollywood and television, universities, and the media. They orchestrated investigations and hearings to identify so-called left-wing agitators. If those identified refused to comply - that is, to say that they were Communists and to inform on their radical friends - they would likely lose their livelihoods. Hollywood producers, TV and radio stations, record companies, colleges, local boards of education, book publishers, and concert halls fired or refused to hire those whose names appeared on notorious lists of so-called \"subversives.\"\n\nThe goal was not simply to root out Communists, but to scare Americans against criticizing American racism, foreign policy, and violations of workers' rights, among other concerns. The Red Scare sought not only to stifle the right to dissent but also the will to dissent by making certain critiques taboo. For example, in the 1949 film The Red Menace , Communists are depicted protesting at a real estate office - a not-so-subtle message that anyone who advocated for housing for veterans or black Americans, common activist issues at the time, must be a Communist.\n\nThe red-baiters particularly targeted civil rights and union activists, high school teachers, college faculty, writers, and performers by canceling their talks, books, performances, and even their passports. Race played an enormous role in the Red Scare. Prominent black figures who were investigated and blacklisted included Paul Robeson, W. E. B. Du Bois, Charlotta Bass, Canada Lee, Dorothy Dandridge, Sidney Poitier, Lena Horne, Richard Wright, Hazel Scott, Harry Belafonte, Ferdinand Smith, Alphaeus Hunton, Langston Hughes, and many others. In July 1949, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) even held three days of hearings on \"Communist Infiltration of Minority Groups.\" As late as the 1960s, the FBI and right-wing groups were going after alleged Communists in the civil rights movement, including several close aides to Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nThe Hughes event in 1948, put on by the Eagle Rock Council, was intended to be a fundraiser to help pay the college costs for a local black female high schooler who wanted to attend Occidental (nicknamed \"Oxy\"), which had just admitted its first black student that year. The council had started after World War II, initially to help displaced Japanese-Americans return to their homes in greater Los Angeles and to challenge the image of Eagle Rock - the neighborhood where Occidental was located - as an \"all-white enclave.\" The council was one of several Los Angeles-based groups involved in a campaign to outlaw racial discrimination in housing at a time when doing so was highly controversial. It was affiliated with the American Council for Race Relations, a liberal but hardly left-wing group that sought to promote religious and racial tolerance.\n\nThe Hughes event at Occidental was set to go off without a hitch. But little did the organizers know that in the weeks leading up to the scheduled talk, State Senator Jack Tenney, chair of the legislature's Fact-Finding Committee on UnAmerican Activities, was completing an investigation into alleged subversives in California.\n\nOne week before the event, Tenney's committee issued a report describing Hughes as a Communist. Occidental officials were alarmed. They denied that Tenney had brought pressure to bear on the college, but president of the college, Arthur G. Coons, told the Los Angeles Times that, \"At this particular time, it is considered unwise to present anyone at a public meeting on the campus whose views are apt to be socially and politically divisive.\" Franklin P. Rush, president of the college's board of trustees, who was also the vice president and general manager of the Southern California Telephone Company, said that Hughes's views were \"not particularly loyal - at least not in line with Occidental's policy as a Christian college.\"\n\nThe red-baiters' goal was not merely to kill the careers of individual radicals, but to send a message through the media to the rest of the country. In this instance, Tenney got the headlines he was hoping for. The Los Angeles Times story was headlined \"Tenney Protests Poet's Billing As Oxy Cancels Date.\" The Sacramento Bee ran with \"Slated Appearance of Negro, Reported Red, Is Opposed.\" \"Occidental Calls Off Poet's Talk\" blared the Los Angeles Daily News . A few days later, the American Civil Liberties Union protested Occidental's action, but that news was ignored by most newspapers. One exception was the California Eagle , a progressive black-oriented paper based in Los Angeles, whose story warned of \"growing American fascism.\"\n\nLike many colleges Occidental, which was founded in 1887, had a long history of excluding black students. A 1939 editorial in the student newspaper the Occidental titled \"A Race Problem at Oxy\" pointed out that the college had not admitted one black student since its founding. Two years earlier, the editorial noted, a black student had been discouraged from applying because of fears no one would room with him and that \"his social life would be unhappily circumscribed. . . . That such a thing can happen is an admission that Oxy has something of a race problem.\" Ironically, Hughes spoke in Thorne Hall at Occidental on February 22, 1939, apparently without any controversy or incident.\n\nIn April 1947, James Dombrowski, a Methodist minister and executive director of the progressive civil rights organization the Southern Conference Educational Fund, spoke on campus. According to a story in the student newspaper, some students told him that the college had resisted admitting black students and that the college's fraternities and sororities were particularly opposed to the idea.\n\nThe following fall - four months after Jackie Robinson broke baseball's color barrier - Oxy admitted its first black student, George Ellison, the son of a Presbyterian minister from Philadelphia. But it was one thing to have a black student on campus. Inviting a black radical to speak to the student body and the wider community was, for some, a bridge too far.\n\nSince the 1920s, Hughes, an important figure in the Harlem Renaissance, had been one of the most prominent black writers in America. He published his first volume of poetry, The Weary Blues, in 1926 , and for the next two decades published a steady stream of novels, plays, operas, essays, memoirs, poems, and a syndicated newspaper column, making him a sought-after public speaker.\n\nHis 1926 essay \"The Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain,\" published in the Nation magazine when Hughes was only twenty-four, became a manifesto for him and other writers and activists who asserted racial pride. He wrote:\n\nThe younger Negro artists who create now intend to express our individual dark-skinned selves without fear or shame. If white people are pleased we are glad. If they are not, it doesn't matter. We know we are beautiful. And ugly, too. The tom-tom cries, and the tom-tom laughs. If colored people are pleased we are glad. If they are not, their displeasure doesn't matter either. We build our temples for tomorrow, strong as we know how, and we stand on top of the mountain free within ourselves.\n\nUpon graduation from Pennsylvania's Lincoln University in 1929, Hughes returned to New York and resumed his prolific career. His first novel Not Without Laughter , published in 1930, won the Harmon Gold Medal for Literature. Its central character is an African American boy, Sandy, caught between two worlds. Sandy's father is footloose and fun loving, while his mother works hard, demands respect, and appreciates the middle-class values of the white community around her. Through Sandy's eyes, Hughes reveals the conflicting values and attitudes within the black community, portraying the lives of the characters in intimate detail.\n\nSoon came Mule Bone , a 1931 play coauthored with Zora Neale Hurston, Popo and Fifina , a 1932 children's book, and The Dream Keeper , a 1932 collection of poems. In 1934, Hughes published a collection of short stories, The Ways of White Folks , about the humorous but ultimately tragic relationships between blacks and whites.\n\nIn his art Hughes portrayed the everyday lives of ordinary black people, including their joys, sorrows, music, humor, and routine encounters with racism. But unlike other prominent black poets of that era, such as Countee Cullen, Claude McKay, and Jean Toomer, Hughes sought to tell the stories of blacks in their own vernacular. This offended some middle-class black Americans who were embarrassed by Hughes's depictions.\n\nLike many Americans, Hughes was radicalized during the Depression, as he saw his family, friends, Harlem, and the country suffer. He developed close ties to the Communist Party (CP) and its orbit of people and organizations. The CP made a priority of organizing and recruiting black Americans and challenging racial segregation and discrimination in jobs, the military, housing, and the criminal justice system, including the persistence of lynching. For example, it raised money for the defense of the Scottsboro Boys, nine black teenage boys unfairly accused of rape in Alabama in 1931. It also sponsored protests and generally publicized the case, which became a national news story.\n\nThat year, Hughes wrote \"Christ in Alabama,\" a poem expressing his outrage at the racial injustice, ideas that he repeated during his speaking tour at black colleges and churches. Three years later, in an article for the Crisis , the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) magazine, Hughes published \"Cowards from the Colleges,\" criticizing the silence of black college and community leaders over the Scottsboro case.\n\nIn 1932, the Soviet Union invited Hughes and forty other black Americans to come make a film, Negro Life , about American racism. Although the film was never completed, Hughes was able to travel throughout the country, which strengthened his increasingly left-wing views and his criticism of the United States.\n\nIn 1935, in his speech to the First American Writers' Congress, a CP-sponsored group, Hughes said:\n\nNegro writers can seek to unite blacks and whites in our country, not on the nebulous basis of an interracial meeting, or the shifting sands of religious brotherhood, but on the solid ground of the daily working class struggle to wipe out, now and forever, all the old inequalities of the past.\n\nIn 1937, Hughes covered the Spanish Civil War for African American newspapers. His reporting reflected the American left's support for the popular forces resisting a takeover by fascist military strongman Francisco Franco.\n\nThe next year, a CP-sponsored group, the International Workers Order, published A New Song , a volume of Hughes's poems, some of which had already been published in the CP-sponsored journal New Masses . Many of the poems in the book reflected causes embraced by the Left in general and the Communist Party in particular. In \"Chant for Tom Mooney,\" Hughes took up the cause of the radical San Francisco labor leader who had been unfairly convicted of a 1916 bombing that killed ten people and whom the CP persistently advocated should be released from prison. Other poems in the collection, including \"Chant for May Day,\" \"Justice,\" \"Lynching Song,\" \"Open Letter to the South,\" \"Song of Spain,\" \"Negro Ghetto,\" \"Ballad of Ozzie Powell\" (one of the Scottsboro Boys), and \"Union,\" reflected Hughes's growing radical consciousness.\n\n\"I speak in the name of the black millions,\" Hughes wrote in the title poem, \"Awakening to Action.\" But he viewed their struggle not only as a battle against racism, but also as part of a crusade for economic justice and equality, writing, \" Revolt! Arise! The Black And White World Shall be one! The Worker's World! \"\n\nIn \"Let America Be America Again,\" originally published in Esquire and included in the collection, Hughes contrasts the nation's promise with its mistreatment of his fellow African Americans, the poor, Native Americans, workers, farmers, and immigrants. He hoped to see a day when America would no longer be divided by class and race divisions:\n\nO, let my land be a land where Liberty Is crowned with no false patriotic wreath, But opportunity is real, and life is free, Equality is in the air we breathe.\n\nNot surprisingly, Hughes was no stranger to controversy. For example, when he arrived at the Vista del Arroyo Hotel in Pasadena in November 1940 to discuss his new autobiography, The Big Sea , he was greeted by a large crowd carrying picket signs and a sound truck that played \"God Bless America\" adorned with a \"100 percent American\" banner. They were followers of evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson, who had denounced Hughes from her Angelus Temple pulpit as a \"radical and anti-Christ,\" and as a \"red devil in black,\" citing his 1932 poem, \" Goodbye Christ \" as evidence. The protest forced the hotel manager to cancel the event.\n\nHughes kept up his prolific writing pace throughout the 1940s, much of it tinged with left-wing ideas about racism and workers' rights. Though he lived in New York, he had many artistic and political ties in the Los Angeles area and frequently visited his local friends during his West Coast speaking tours.\n\nAfter he returned from his visit to the Soviet Union, he encouraged his friend Frances E. Williams, a black actress, to study theater in that country. She followed his advice and, once back in the United States, had a successful career as an actress and director. In 1941, Williams moved to Los Angeles, where she quickly became an activist in left-wing circles, befriending Charlotta Bass , publisher and editor of the California Eagle , the progressive black newspaper. Williams organized events, including plays, art exhibits, and other cultural exhibitions, and her home became a meeting place for leftist activists. In 1948, Williams became the first black woman to run for the California State Assembly , on the Progressive Party ticket. She was a leader of the new Screen Actors Guild union, Actors' Equity Association, and the National Negro Labor Council.\n\nIt is likely that Williams helped organize Hughes's speaking gigs in Los Angeles, which included his planned talk at Occidental in March 1948. Any California politician trying to identify so-called radical \"subversives\" wouldn't have to dig deep to turn up Williams, Bass, and their well-known friend Hughes.\n\nThroughout most of the 1930s, State Senator Tenney had been a leader in the musicians' union and a New Dealer. In 1936, he was elected to the California State Assembly as a Democrat. But he soon moved to the right, and in 1940, he was elected to the state senate as a Republican, serving for twelve more years. During his time in the state senate, he became the state's most high-profile anti-Communist, elevating his visibility by crusading against radicals within California's labor unions, universities, public schools, Hollywood, and other sectors. \"You can no more coexist with communism than you can coexist with a nest of rattlesnakes,\" Tenney proclaimed.\n\nIn 1940, Tenney cosponsored a bill to remove from the California ballot any political party with the word \"Communist\" in its title or that had any ties to the Communist Party. The bill passed and was reluctantly signed into law by Governor Culbert Olson. In 1941, he became chair of the newly formed Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities. This became his vehicle to gain public attention by investigating and attacking so-called \"subversives.\"\n\nTenney was in cahoots with California business leaders, who were worried about the public's support for labor unions, regulations, higher taxes on the rich, and the expansion of government social programs, including subsidized housing and health care. In 1941, soon after Walt Disney paid for an ad in Variety that blamed Communists for instigating a strike of his cartoonists , Tenney used his committee to launch a probe into \"Reds in movies.\" He didn't find any, but he grabbed lots of headlines.\n\nThroughout the 1940s, during hearings and when talking to the press, Tenney used phrases like \"Communist front\" and \"fellow traveler\" indiscriminately to stigmatize people involved in social causes and to paint as wholly Communist any liberal organization that had members with alleged ties to the CP. Tenney knew that he could generate more headlines by focusing on well-known public figures, so it should not be surprising that while his committee began a series of investigations of hundreds of alleged Communists, it included such well-known people as Robeson, writer-activist Carey McWilliams, housing advocate Catherine Bauer Wurster, labor organizer Luisa Moreno, actor Edward G. Robinson, and of course Hughes. By 1947, Congress was conducting its own investigation into Communists in Hollywood and other industries. Those and later hearings attracted media attention for politicians on the Senate and House witch-hunting committees.\n\nIn the years after World War II, Hughes was still a popular figure, giving talks at colleges, churches, community groups, libraries, literary clubs, and other venues. His speeches always included powerful denunciations of American racism. But by the middle of 1947, as the Red Scare escalated, Hughes had started to come under attack by veterans' groups and conservative radio commentators and columnists.\n\nIn a common tactic, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover began leaking information about Hughes's left-wing ties and his criticisms of organized religion to the press and to groups that had invited him to speak, many of which began to cancel his talks. In early March 1948, for example, the exclusive North Shore Country Day School outside Chicago canceled Hughes's talk after the Chicago Tribune ran a front-page story titled \"Red-Tinged Poet to Speak at Winnetka Private School.\"\n\nForeshadowing the censorship efforts of Sen. Joe McCarthy - and indeed those of current Florida governor Ron DeSantis - in early 1947, Tenney began an investigation into so-called \"subversive\" textbooks used in California's public schools. By subversive, Tenney and his anti-Communist allies meant books that dealt with issues such as slum housing, unfair labor practices, and racial and religious discrimination. This is the effort that first brought Hughes to Tenney's attention, as Hughes's stories and poems were taught in some California classrooms. Tenney sponsored a bill to forbid California's public schools from teaching \"un-American\" subjects and require them to teach \"Americanism\" as part of the curriculum.\n\nTenney's committee officially released its 448-page report on \"Communist Front Organizations\" on March 24, 1948. The report mentioned Hughes forty-six times, identifying a number of organizations that he was allegedly affiliated with - some true and others false. The report noted that \"Hughes may be said to rate with Paul Robeson as notorious Negro leaders in the Communist field.\"\n\nThe report mentioned that Hughes was scheduled to speak at Occidental the following week. A few days before the report's official release, on March 21, the Occidental board of trustees had canceled Hughes's talk, having no doubt been contacted by Tenney himself. The document trumpeted the about-face, saying, \"As this report goes to press, a spokesman for Occidental College announces that the institution has canceled Hughes's appearance.\" The Tenney report also attacked the Eagle Rock Council for Civic Unity, the group that had invited Hughes to speak at Occidental. The report noted that Jerome W. McNair, the council's program director, \"is affiliated with a number of Communist organizations including the American Civil Liberties Union and the American-Russian Institute.\"\n\nThe next week, Hughes gave two talks in Los Angeles, one sponsored by the League of Allied Art and the Unitarian Club, the other by the Beverly-Fairfax Jewish Community Center. But the following week, his scheduled talks at public schools in Palo Alto and Vallejo were canceled in response to veterans and church groups concerned about his \"possible Communistic connections.\"\n\nThe Hughes incident at Occidental was only one small part of Tenney's vigorous anti-Communist crusade. In 1949, Tenney drafted legislation to put a constitutional amendment on the state ballot that would give the legislature the authority to prohibit the University of California from hiring \"disloyal\" faculty. Fearful of Tenney's power, in 1950, the university's board of regents agreed to institute a \"loyalty oath\" for all faculty. Of the sixty-nine professors fired nationwide for political reasons during the Red Scare, almost half were from the University of California, most of them on the Berkeley and Los Angeles campuses, for refusing to sign the loyalty oath.\n\nBut Tenney's 1948 report, loyalty oath, and \"Americanism\" in schools campaigns were his last hurrah. In 1949, his state senate colleagues removed him as chair of the Un-American Activities Committee, in part for violating due process and in part because of the hundreds of people brought before his committee over eight years as so-called subversives, not one had been indicted, much less convicted. Tenney had done much to bring about the Red Scare, which would only intensify in the coming decade, but he'd done so at the cost of his personal ambitions. (The same eventually happened to Senator McCarthy, who was censured by his US Senate colleagues in 1954 for his recklessness, which soon destroyed his political career.)\n\nIn 1949, Tenney finished fourth in his campaign for Los Angeles mayor. In 1952, he lost his campaign for the US House of Representatives as well as his bizarre run for vice president of the United States on the right-wing Christian Nationalist Party. Two years later, he was defeated in the Republican primary for his own state senate seat. During the 1950s, he published several conspiratorial antisemitic books including Anti-Gentile Activity in America , Zion's Fifth Column, Zionist Network, and Zion's Trojan Horse. He wound up serving as part-time city attorney in Cabazon, a small town in the California desert. He died in 1970 at age seventy.\n\nDespite Tenney's political demise, his tactics inspired other politicians like McCarthy and Richard Nixon, who made names for themselves as anti-Communist Red-hunters as the Cold War intensified. In 1950, a group of former FBI agents, with help from the FBI and Congress's House Committee on Un-American Activities, issued a report titled \"Red Channels: The Report of Communist Influence in Radio and Television.\"\n\nIt listed 151 actors, writers, musicians, broadcast journalists, and others whom it claimed, often with dubious evidence at best, were part of the Communist influence in the entertainment industry - including actors Edward G. Robinson, Lee J. Cobb, Avon Long, and Orson Welles, writers Arthur Miller and Dashiell Hammett, and musical artists Leonard Bernstein, Pete Seeger, Josh White, Lena Horne, Aaron Copland, and Hughes. Many of of those listed in \"Red Channels\" were issued subpoenas to testify before Congress and blacklisted for refusing to cooperative with Congress's witch-hunt.\n\nIn its section on Hughes, the \"Red Channels\" report identified more than forty so-called subversive left-wing organizations and publications that Hughes had allegedly been affiliated with. These included the American Peace Mobilization, Friends of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, American Labor Party, International Labor Defense, Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee, League of American Writers, American Youth for Democracy, National Negro Congress, New Theatre League, National Council of Soviet-American Friendship, People's Songs, the New Masses , and the Daily Worker .\n\nIn 1953, McCarthy's Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations called Hughes to testify. Rather than defy the politicians, he chose to cooperate. He refused to name names, but he repudiated his past radical ideas. Under questioning from McCarthy and his top lawyer Roy Cohn (who would later be Donald Trump's lawyer), Hughes denied he had ever been a Communist Party member. He admitted that he once admired the Soviet Union, but said that he had become disillusioned years earlier. He claimed that his poem \"Goodbye Christ\" had been misunderstood and that he was neither an atheist nor anti-religious. He maintained that be believed in democracy and racial equality, and seemed to be criticizing McCarthyism itself, when he told the committee:\n\nI would like to see an America where people of any race, color, or creed may live on a plane of cultural and material well-being, cooperating together unhindered by sectarian, radical, or factional prejudices and harmful intolerances that do nobody any good, an America proud of its tradition, capable of facing the future without the necessary pitting of people against people and without the disease of personal distrust and suspicion of one's neighbor.\n\nHughes's cooperation with McCarthy's committee cost him his friendships with Robeson, Du Bois, and others who had defied the witch-hunters. Hughes severed his ties with several left-wing groups, including the American Labor Party and the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship, which the FBI, the Department of Justice, and Congressional Red-hunters viewed as Communist-led organizations. In 1959, when he published Selected Poems , he left out some of his more radical poems.\n\nWhether Hughes sincerely rejected his radical past or simply accommodated himself to the realities of being a black writer trying to make a living in Cold War America is unknown. Although he publicly abandoned many of his left-wing views, he continued to protest the social and racial conditions endured by African Americans and to promote black culture in his many works. He also continued to celebrate socialist and anti-colonial revolutions in Africa in his poetry. As Billie Anania has written for Jacobin, his later work \"continued to connect racist policing with US-backed dictators in the Third World and expressed solidarity with liberation movements in Cairo, Cape Town, and Angola.\"\n\nIn 1951, when he was still under assault by right-wingers, Hughes wrote \"Dream Deferred.\" The poem includes some of most well-known lines in American literature:\n\nWhat happens to a dream deferred? Does it dry up Like a raisin in the sun? Or fester like a sore- And then run? Does it stink like rotten meat? Or crust and sugar over- like a syrupy sweet? Maybe it just sags like a heavy load. Or does it explode?\n\nThe poem appeared to be a prediction of the coming civil rights movement - the sit-ins, voter registration drives, protest marches, and the urban rebellions of the 1950s and '60s.\n\nHe was already a well-respected writer, but the civil rights movement and the subsequent explosion of interest in black studies and black literature boosted his visibility, as his writings became widely read in high schools and colleges. He was often called the \"Poet Laureate of the Negro Race.\"\n\nDuring his lifetime, Hughes published fifteen volumes of poetry, ten novels and collections of short stories, twenty plays and operas, two autobiographies, four books about black history, hundreds of magazine articles and newspaper columns, and seven books for children, including books about Africa, the West Indies, jazz, and black history. He translated into English the works of the Spanish poet Federico García Lorca and the Latin American Nobel laureate poet Gabriela Mistral.\n\nHughes's racial consciousness and pride, as well as his depictions of black life, influenced later generations of artists and activists in Africa and the Caribbean as well as in the United States. During the 1960s, he inspired and supported many young black writers, helping shape a new wave of black literature. In his 1967 anthology The Best Short Stories by Negro Writers , Hughes included a short story by a then unknown Georgia-born writer, Alice Walker, a student at Sarah Lawrence College. \"His support for me meant more than I can say,\" recalled Walker, who has become one of her generation's most acclaimed writers.\n\nThe playwright Loften Mitchell, a generation younger than Hughes, said, \"Langston set a tone, a standard of brotherhood and friendship and cooperation, for all of us to follow. You never got from him, 'I am the Negro writer,' but only 'I am a Negro writer.' He never stopped thinking about the rest of us.\"\n\nBut even after he disavowed Communism, Hughes's work was still not immune from controversy. In 1965, the Boston school board fired twenty-eight-year-old teacher Jonathan Kozol for reading Hughes's poem \"The Ballad of the Landlord,\" which portrays the exploitation of black tenants by white landlords, to his black fourth-grade students, going outside the school's prescribed curriculum. Kozol described his experiences in the first of his many books, Death At An Early Age: The Destruction of the Hearts and Minds of Negro Children in the Boston Public Schools, which won the 1967 National Book Award.\n\nHughes was never invited back to speak at Occidental. But like other colleges, Oxy was shaped by the civil rights revolution and particularly by the 1965 uprising in Watts, a black part of Los Angeles. By the late 1960s and '70s, Oxy began to recruit more black, brown, and low-income students. In 1968, the college hired its first black faculty member, Mary Jane Hewitt, who offered the first courses in black literature and culture. Hewitt had a wide network of local and national black artists, musicians, and actors and was influential in providing Occidental students, especially the few black students on campus, with an understanding of black culture and the contributions of African Americans to American culture.\n\nOne of the students who came to Oxy in that period was Roger Guenveur Smith, who graduated in 1977. Smith recalls walking into one of Hewitt's classes one day and finding the professor talking with writers Maya Angelou and James Baldwin, and actor Roscoe Lee Browne. In one course with Hewitt, Smith wrote a paper about Hughes. For his senior project, he created and performed \"An Evening with Frederick Douglass,\" the first in a series of biographically and historically infused plays which have become his signature as an award-winning actor, playwright, and director. He's returned to the campus several times to teach and perform.\n\nIn 1979, a black student from Hawaii, then known as Barry Obama, arrived on campus. Two years later, he gave his first political speech at an anti-apartheid rally on campus. Rumor has it that he achieved some success after college.

And not only on the Right.\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe only thing more predictable than riots in the United States' dilapidated cities is the outpouring of moralizing pseudo-explanations that accompany them. In this, as in so much else, Ferguson has been no exception. Between riffs on the venerable trope of \"outside agitators,\" commentators groping for an explanation of the uprising have seized on another, equally well-established mythology: the idea of a culture of poverty among black Americans.\n\nRacists began blowing on this particular dog-whistle as soon as the murder of Michael Brown began to attract national attention. No doubt in the coming months it will only get louder. As the sheer scale and brutality of racial inequality in the US comes, however hazily, into popular focus, conservatives across the country will, much like Zionists suddenly concerned with the fate of the Syrian uprising, suddenly evince an intense preoccupation with the lives of black Americans. We will hear how welfare has made blacks dependent on the government, has broken up the black family, and has encouraged a culture of criminality and violence (as evidenced by all that rap music).\n\nVariations on that basic narrative have, of course, become the norm in the language favored by the Right whenever it's confronted with questions of racism. But the influence of the culture of poverty thesis extends far beyond the ranks of Republican officials, Tea Party activists, and Fox News talking heads - apparent, for instance, in the near-universal tendency to turn any discussion of the pervasive inequalities and discrimination suffered by African Americans into a moralizing sermon about the cultural pathologies of black people.\n\nThe New York Times led the way in this regard, sagely informing its readers that Brown was \"no angel\" and detailing accusations that he had committed petty theft and fought with his family. The article went on to say that Brown \"lived in a community that had rough patches, and he dabbled in drugs and alcohol. He had taken to rapping in recent months, producing lyrics that were by turns contemplative and vulgar. He got into at least one scuffle with a neighbor.\"\n\nEven in those venues where this kind of attack on the character of a murdered young black man is recognized for the victim blaming it is, there is a reticence to directly confront the larger claims the culture of poverty theory makes about African-American culture. One can find any number of articles responding to the latest coded racism from the loud Republican of the moment, which point out how conservatives ignore the history of racial oppression and blame the black poor for their own suffering. Far more rare, however, is a direct confrontation with the description of black culture entailed by the culture of poverty narrative.\n\nThis is ironic, because every aspect of that narrative has been subjected to withering criticism by social scientists over the last thirty years. It is not simply that the aspects of black culture that the narrative identifies have been shaped by structural forces like racism; for the most part, they either don't exist at all, or else are reflective of norms and values that are commonplace in the United States - and are not, therefore, unique features of the \"black community.\" Every component of the culture of poverty narrative is a phantasm, a projection of racial fantasies on to the culture of African Americans, which has for several centuries now served as the screen on which the national unconscious plays out.\n\nPut more bluntly, they are lies.\n\nTake, for example, the claim that black youth inhabit a culture that venerates criminality, in which having been incarcerated is a matter of pride. This particular trope has seen heavy circulation in the last few years, trotted out to rationalize every death of a young black man at the hands of the police or vigilantes. Constructed out of a conglomeration of supposedly \"thuggish\" photos, snatches of rap lyrics, or social media ephemera, it works to make respectable the narrative that, in every case, it was the black teenager who threw himself in a fury at the men with guns. Confronted with such deep-seated criminality, the pundits innocently ask, what else were the police supposed to do?\n\nEthnographies of returned prisoners and their families reveal a very different world, one that coincides more with the commonsense notion that people who already face discrimination in the labor market would hardly celebrate events, like incarceration, that will make their lives even harder. Donald Braman spent four years conducting interviews with prisoners, ex-prisoners, and their families in the Washington, DC, area, and found that black families regarded incarceration with anything but pride.\n\nInstead, he found a pervasive sense of shame. Families of those in prison hid the truth from even their extended family, and went to great lengths to conceal the fact from their social circles. In interviewing close to fifty families, Braman reported that not one was \"out\" as having a member in prison to their entire extended family. Reading the stories he collects, one gets a sense of a suffocating stigma, a desperation not to be associated with the prison system in any way.\n\nIn light of Braman's work, the claim that young black men are happy to be locked up is perverse. There is no culture of criminality in black communities. Convenient as it may be to ascribe one to the victims of state violence, all of the evidence suggests that black families work incredibly hard to keep their members out of prison, and feel a profound sense of failure when they are unable to. In fact, compared with white families, black families place an even greater emphasis on following the rules and obeying authority . Given the disproportionate consequences black youth face for their transgressions, this differential is hardly surprising. Yet the disseminators of this lie persist, attempting to convince the nation that African Americans are (\"culturally, not biologically!\" they hasten to add) simply unable to assess even the most brutally obvious consequences of their actions on their lives.\n\nThe disconnect between claims of a culture of criminality and the evidence presented by reality is not at all unusual when it comes to the various elements that make up the culture of poverty narrative. Its other facets are equally guilty of inverting the world in which we live. Consider three prominent claims made by the would-be augurs of black culture: that black students devalue education out of a conception of school as a white thing, that black parents place a low value on marriage and a stable family life, and that the black poor are simply uninterested in finding work. All of these have been given voice across the political spectrum, from liberals to reactionaries, and all of them are patently false.\n\nThe notion of a black disdain for school as a \"white thing\" has been given voice recently by Barack Obama himself. Giving an address for his neoliberal \"My Brother's Keeper\" program, Obama took the opportunity to opine that in black communities \"there's been the notion of 'acting white,' \" where high-achieving black students are stigmatized by their peers. Obama was relatively restrained in his invocation of \"acting white theory,\" as it's called, confining himself to the assertion that it exists and is wrong, insofar as doing well in school does not compromise one's racial authenticity.\n\nThe very fact, however, that the president felt the phenomenon was important enough to comment on suggests that he thought black attitudes on this question were skewed enough to warrant correction. Other commentators have been even bolder in their use of the theory, trotting it out to explain that black attitudes, and not white racism, are the cause of black-white educational disparities.\n\nDespite its ubiquity in popular discussions, however, acting white theory has come under sustained criticism from education scholars. As social scientists have attempted to test the theory, they have found over and over that black and white students' attitudes on education do not differ substantively. Black students, just like their white counterparts, express a desire to do well in school, and report higher self-esteem when they succeed.\n\nIn fact, recent research by Ivory Toldson suggests that it is white male students who express the most ambivalence about the impact of good grades on their social standing. By contrast, 95% of black female students reported that, if they did really well in school, they would be proud and tell all of their friends about it. Similarly, black students were most likely to report that their friends would be happier if they went to college than if they didn't. Most white students said their friends wouldn't care either way.\n\nIn light of this body of research, the attempt to pin responsibility for educational inequality on black students themselves is beyond perverse. Black students, understandably, place a higher premium on education than white students, because they know they will pay a higher price for lacking it than white students will. Yet the aspirations of black students, however well-documented, fail to make any impact on discussions of race and education in national media. White talking heads (and black conservatives, it must be said) feel no qualms whatsoever about loudly condemning the youth of an entire race for lacking ambition, while remaining criminally silent themselves on the structures that actually frustrate black students' real and dearly-held ambitions.\n\nThe story is, if anything, even nastier when it comes to marriage and the family. Lamentations over the decline of the black family, in particular, are something of a national ritual in the United States, and have been for decades. In the inner city, we are told, there is a culture of single parenting, and having children with multiple partners. From here, descriptions of that culture frequently veer into the luridly racist, with \"broodmares\" being one epithet of choice for black mothers. This culture is then held to be at the root of any number of problems, as absent fathers are blamed for black children doing poorly in school or getting in trouble, and mothers dependent on welfare programs inducing a \"culture of dependency\" in their children.\n\nOnce again, this narrative is profoundly mistaken. Historically, as Herbert Gutman pointed out decades ago, black Americans have placed a tremendous value on maintaining family structures, and have actually had a lower divorce rate than white Americans. Since the 1960s, it's true that single-parent households have become far more common in black communities (though not only there), and this is the era commentators typically focus on, blaming the loss of a mythological united community under Jim Crow in more liberal versions of the story, or welfare programs in more reactionary ones. Both, however, see a transformation in black attitudes as central.\n\nBut social scientists working on family structures, however, have found that variables like the ratio of employed men to women are far stronger predictors of what families look like than attitudes are. When the supply of employed, non-incarcerated men is controlled for, black and white marriage rates look more similar than different.\n\nAttitudes towards marriage also display no great divergence between black and white Americans. Most black Americans value marriage highly, though, as is the case with whites, men tend to value it more highly than women. This last datum is particularly ironic, given the pervasive scapegoating of black men for supposedly abandoning their children after conception. In fact, as numerous studies have found, black fathers maintain high levels of contact with their children even when not co-habitating with the child's mother, and express a strong desire to be even more present in their children's lives. Even more significantly, as Kathryn Edin has noted , \"African Americans' higher valuation of marriage relative to that of whites narrows the racial gap in marriage.\" Black culture is responsible for the gap in marriage rates being smaller than it otherwise would be, not larger.\n\nWith this in mind, the recurrent political fantasy of addressing inequality in the US through marriage promotion programs aimed at the black poor in particular is a sick joke. If people like Sam Brownback, who wrote one of the most recent such proposals , actually cared about the marriage rate among poor black Americans, he would address himself to ending things like mass incarceration and the endemic joblessness in American cities, which all the evidence suggests play a massive role in disrupting black attempts to form stable nuclear families. The irony, of course, is that his preferred alternative is predicated on attempting to sell something to African Americans that they have been trying for literally centuries to buy at a price higher than he could possibly imagine.\n\nOne final component of the culture of poverty, and in some ways the most central, is the myth that the black unemployed simply don't want to find work. This was given particularly vulgar voice recently by Samuel \"Joe the Plumber\" Wurzelbacher, whose relentless self-promotion is indeed a monument to what hard-working white ethnics, with the help of a complicit media, can achieve. Commenting on the protesters in Ferguson, he suggested that the best way to disperse the demonstrators would be to hold a job fair, at the sight of which they would \"scatter like leaves.\" Though the sheer contempt for the black poor may be more visible in Wurzelbacher's quip than in other instances, in substance it doesn't differ in the least from Republican wunderkind Paul Ryan's pronunciation that inner city men simply don't appreciate the value of work.\n\nThis conceit has suffered perhaps more thorough rebuttal than any other component of the culture of poverty. Since the 1960s, social scientists have produced study after study demonstrating that poor and unemployed black Americans have basically the same attitudes towards work as the rest of country. In fact, a recent study found that black job seekers are even more resilient than their white counterparts, staying in the job market longer despite persistent frustrations of their search for employment. One waits in vain for such results to generate a moral panic over the decline of a work ethic in white communities.\n\nWhen it comes to the notion of welfare dependency, the verdict is much the same. One study looking at black single mothers in Milwaukee found that these women's families were a major contributor to the high value they placed on education and finding a career. Far from being the transmission belt of a \"culture of dependency,\" black families act as a support network encouraging their members to achieve as much as possible. The same study found that women on welfare, almost to a person, \"hated it\" and wished they could leave the program. However, the demands of childcare, combined with a lack of job opportunities, ensured that leaving was difficult for most.\n\nOther studies have found similar results, with welfare being largely stigmatized in black communities. In fact, a number of studies have found that people on welfare, black Americans included, feel that people take advantage of the system and receive benefits when they should not. Here, the constant demonization of people on welfare has had an effect on welfare recipients themselves. While attributing their own use to structural factors such as discrimination and joblessness, they attribute others' use of the system to laziness (importantly, however, this suspicion does not carry over into political support for attacks on welfare state, which are consistently opposed by people receiving benefits). The distance from the popular portrayal of black communities content to remain on the dole could not be clearer.\n\nAll of this is to suggest that the constant projections onto some kind of collective black psyche obscures the fact that African Americans and white Americans are motivated by much the same things. Still, the absence of evidence for their existence hasn't prevented these tropes of black cultural pathologies from entering into nearly every discussion of \"race relations\" in recent years. Indeed, belief in a black culture of poverty has become so entrenched that it is accepted without question for the most part. The prevalence of those assumptions are inseparable from the dominance of a politics that rejects structural solutions for the social disparities and entrenched discrimination facing African Americans, in favor of an emphasis on community self-help and personal responsibility.\n\nThus, we find ourselves in a situation in which public discussion of problems related to high rates of joblessness, child poverty, infant mortality, and many negative social indicators among African Americans is largely restricted to exhortations for a transformation of behavioral norms and attitudes. Instead of a political agenda to deal with pervasive disparities in wealth, educational opportunities, access to employment, and the like, we're told that upward mobility for African Americans depends on the inculcation of values that promote success; black communities, this approach suggests, must learn to celebrate family, encourage hard work, and embrace education.\n\nNot full employment but individual initiative and a commitment to advancement through low-wage work and job training will boost chronically low employment levels. Not a substantial program of redistributive reforms but incentives to encourage entrepreneurship will boost the resources of the black community. Not strengthened anti-discrimination measures or equal access to health care but altered lifestyle choices, better parenting, and the influence of positive role models will reduce health disparities and improve social outcomes for black kids.\n\nImplicit in all this is the idea that if African Americans have failed to overcome the racial stratification of American society, the reason is to be found - at least in large part - in the cultural and psychological character of the black community. The result has been the diffusion of a language around \"race\" that mirrors the \"color-blind\" racism associated with the post-Civil Rights era - a language that simultaneously downplays the significance of actual discrimination while stigmatizing African Americans for behaviors that go unremarked upon in the case of white Americans.\n\nIt is, for instance, not uncommon for conversations that are ostensibly addressing issues like mass incarceration and police violence to devolve into criticism of the dressing habits of young black men or the hedonism and violence in rap lyrics. The double standard at work here should be obvious: no one, for instance, questions whether the predilection of white teenagers for personal attire that can range from the bizarre to the obscene shouldn't make them the objects of scrutiny by police or potential employers. Bill Cosby's rant attacking black Americans for everything from the linguistic habits of black teenagers to the names given to black children was treated by everyone from Barack Obama to Bill O'Reilly as a serious call for self-reflection by the \"black community.\" Yet it would be impossible to imagine a situation in which the personal appearance and lifestyle choices of attendees at the annual Burning Man festival would ever inspire such anxiety.\n\nThe upshot is that even sympathetic observers tend to interpret concerns about deprivation and social disorganization through the prism of cultural or psychological damage. That dynamic is particularly evident in our proclivity to attribute problems like crime or violence in black neighborhoods to ill-defined features of black men's emotional existence. As a consequence, responsibility for these issues is commonly attributed to such causes as a lack of self-regard among African-American males, their purportedly nihilistic and myopic worldview, or their orientation on short-term, narrowly self-interested gain over long-term ambition and social uplift.\n\nThat tendency to speculate about the emotional or psychological state of young black men is emblematic of the way that \"race\" functions in America. In translating discussions of questions like crime and violence into explorations of group psychology, we effectively shift the focus from the social context for street violence in lower-income, predominantly black urban areas to the character of black people. That not only reinforces a blame-the-victim politics that refuses to acknowledge racism - embodied in the cynical use of the category \"black on black crime\" to dismiss concerns about police violence during the Ferguson protests - it also leads to a distorted view of the sources of elevated violence and chronic insecurity in black neighborhoods.\n\nPart of the reason that the trope of \"black on black crime\" has garnered such traction is because it feeds on very genuine concerns about issues like the high levels of violence crime suffered by some black communities. While homicide rates have declined precipitously across the US over the past two decades, the devastating number of shooting deaths suffered by black residents in cities like Chicago has received national attention in recent years. Confronted with the destructive effects of gun violence, many observers have interpreted it as a reflection of deep-seated social pathologies - the inverse of the racism of the US criminal justice system.\n\nResearch suggests that violent crime rates are driven by a variety of social factors which tend to make American cities particularly prone to gun violence against black residents. Among the most of these factors are very high levels of neighborhood segregation, concentrated un- and underemployment , poverty and a dearth of adequate social services or institutional resources . Fundamentally, gun violence has to be treated like other kinds of public health problems - not as the basis for continuous, empty calls for an introspective discussion about \"black on black violence.\" And like other kinds of public health disparities , tackling high rates of inter-personal violence requires confronting the social context in which it occurs.\n\nAnd yet, the culture-of-poverty narrative leads us away from that perspective, and exacerbates the widespread tendency to view social inequality through the lens of personal responsibility and cultural predispositions.\n\nGiven that the culture of poverty argument today is most strongly associated with the Right, it is surprising to learn that its provenance actually comes from the other end of the spectrum. The phrase itself achieved notoriety with Daniel Patrick Moynihan's famous report on the black family (\" The Negro Family: The Case for National Action \"), though he had himself drawn it from anthropologist Oscar Lewis' work. In the decades since then, as \"the Moynihan report\" has, quite properly, come to serve as shorthand on the Left for a pathologization of the black family and a victim-blaming rhetoric, it has been easy to forget that Moynihan himself was no Strom Thurmond, but a Great Society liberal with impeccable credentials. The concept itself comes not from the Right, which was then still mired in explicitly biological racism, but from liberals cognizant of the injustice of inequality, but too attached to ideas of black deficiency to jettison them entirely.\n\nAs American liberalism has moved steadily rightward since the 1970s, versions of the culture-of-poverty thesis have gained increasingly traction. In Moynihan's time, these sorts of ideas were counterbalanced by a liberalism that genuinely sought the expansion of the American welfare state. Hubert Humphrey, running for president in 1968, promised to hire a teacher for every policeman Richard Nixon wanted to hire, and build a house for every jail George Wallace wanted to build. By the 1990s, this sort of commitment had nearly disappeared from American liberalism, leaving culture of poverty arguments hegemonic. The importance of the culture-of-poverty approach is that it allows for recognition of the accumulated history of racism and inequality, but posits the ongoing effects of these as mediated through black cultural pathologies. It therefore permits American liberals to identify with opposition to racism while pushing them towards policy solutions geared towards the transformation of black people, and not American society.\n\nToday, these ideas are given voice by all manner of actors residing left of center on the political spectrum. Barack Obama's few engagements with the subject of racial inequality all draw on the idea of a culture of poverty, even if never explicitly named as such, from his condescending hectoring of black fathers to his gross suggestion that too many black parents feed their children fried chicken for breakfast. Jonathan Chait has also recently revealed himself to be an adherent, criticizing Ta-Nahesi Coates' recent writing for being insufficiently attentive to the deficiencies of black culture.\n\nThe Reverend Al Sharpton gave a particularly abhorrent reminder that conservatives have no monopoly on the culture of poverty at Michael Brown's funeral. In his eulogy , Sharpton lectured the assembled audience on the need for greater personal responsibility in the black community: \"We have got to be outraged by our disrespect for each other, our disregard for each other, our killing and shooting and running around gun-toting each other,\" he said, \"so that they're justified in trying to come at us because some of us act like the definition of blackness is how low you can go. . .\" In contrast to earlier generations of African Americans, who were presumably more worthy of equal rights, black people today exhibit a proclivity for bad behavior and bad manners, Sharpton said, concluding \"Now, you want to be a n-- and call your woman a 'ho.' You've lost where you're coming from.\"\n\nFor many on the Left, it's easy to recognize how backwards and self-defeating this kind of rhetoric can be. In shifting the locus of responsibility for the deep-seated inequities of American capitalism to the very people who are the victims of its greatest injustices, Sharpton is playing into the hands of the white conservatives who so often attack him for playing the \"race card.\"\n\nAnd yet the notion that the entrenched racial disparities of US society are, at least in part, the product of black cultural pathologies, retains enormous traction. Sharpton and Cosby are hardly alone among black Americans in identifying with versions of this narrative. A recent survey , for example, revealed that black men both tend to value education and work highly, yet thought that other black men spent too much time thinking about sports and sex. So pervasive is this ideology that people who know it to be false of themselves are willing to believe it of others. The argument can also take a more nationalist register, as in the contention that slavery damaged black American culture so profoundly that the resulting cultural deficiencies, often identified as a lack of community or self-respect, explain aspects of black inequality today, from educational disparities to economic impoverishment.\n\nForty years ago, both black nationalism and American liberalism existed in forms that looked squarely at the basic structure of American society for an explanation of racial inequality. The shift of both these ideologies away from that orientation in subsequent decades is in line with the larger retreat of the Left away from structural solutions and into more local and personalized projects. Effectively, the Left's horizons have shrunk in tandem with its social power.\n\nWhen it comes to race, however, this retreat has had particularly pernicious effects. The shrinking of ambition to the personal level here has resulted in a convergence with the kinds of victim-blaming narratives peddled in official \"colorblind\" ideology. When liberals or black nationalists agree that black crime contains some larger meaning about the state of the black community, they make the work of racist ideologues easier. They reinforce the basic point that black crime must be agonized over as a barometer of the cultural values of the race, while white crime may be treated as a normal aspect of a complex society.\n\nIn doing so, they give succor to those who seek to block any attempt at addressing the real causes of racial inequality, while rendering half-hearted and tenuous those attempts still being launched from within American liberalism itself. And all on the basis of ideas that, for all liberals' supposed commitment to reason and moderation, are no more connected with reality than birther fantasies.\n\nLike so many other \"zombie ideas\" in our current moment, the culture of poverty narrative persists not because of its success in explaining reality, but in spite of it. What it does succeed in doing is providing an explanation of reality that salves the consciences of the powerful and their supporters. Unfortunately, in an era when collective action by the oppressed is still far too sporadic and ephemeral, these kinds of explanations have sunk deep roots, into both layers of left-liberal opinion and oppressed groups themselves.\n\nYet what the social science literature demonstrates is that however secure the culture of poverty seems as a hegemonic explanation for racial inequality, it ultimately rests on what are, at the end of the day, nothing more than lies. As the uprising in Ferguson has highlighted the connection between American imperialism and militarism on the home front, it is worth remembering that cultural explanations of structural processes have never been a purely domestic affair.\n\nCommenting on the horrific death toll of the Vietnamese during the American war on Vietnam, William Westmoreland infamously explained to an interviewer that \"the Oriental doesn't put the same high price on life as does a Westerner. Life is plentiful. Life is cheap in the Orient.\" For a long time, this remark epitomized the racism of the war. We should view cultural explanations of inequality with the same contempt.\n\nPaul Heideman holds a PhD in American studies from Rutgers University-Newark.\n\nJonah Birch is a visiting assistant professor in sociology at Appalachian State University and a contributing editor at Jacobin .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

In Struggle , his series of paintings on the American Revolution, he opened up new territory in American history by venturing beyond the narrow set of topics like Harlem, jazz clubs, and cotton plantations which had become synonymous with black art in mid-century America.\n\nJacob Lawrence was an American painter who grew up in Harlem. (Wikimedia Commons)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nLeftists have a fraught relationship with the American Revolution. Today, it is mostly a site of vacuous patriotism, its themes appropriated by the Tea Party and recently echoed in the rhetoric of the Trump supporters who broke into the Capitol chanting \"1776.\"\n\nSince the first stirrings of conflict between Britain and the colonists, American radicals have pointed out the hypocrisy of the revolutionary elite who demanded equality for themselves while holding people in bondage. It is perhaps surprising, then, that Jacob Lawrence, the celebrated painter of the black working class, took up this history in a thirty-painting series entitled Struggle: From the History of the American People .\n\nBorn in Atlantic City and raised in Harlem, Lawrence got his start as a Works Progress Administration-sponsored artist during the New Deal. A creator of intimately scaled history paintings during a period when monumentality and abstraction was dominant in art, his best known work, the sixty-panel Migration Series, addresses the mass movement of African Americans from the rural south into northern cities and the resulting social, cultural, and economic changes to black life.\n\nElsewhere, Lawrence's paintings represent histories of black liberation, chronicling the lives of revolutionaries including Toussaint L'Ouverture , Harriet Tubman, and John Brown in a dynamic, cubism-inflected style. His political commitments, which earned him a spot on an FBI watch list in 1953, are manifest in his bold and straightforward depictions of segregation, police brutality, poverty, and violent evictions in his Harlem community.\n\nCreated between 1954 and 1956, Struggle is among Lawrence's least-known works. Last year, twenty-six of its thirty panels (four are unlocated and possibly lost) were reunited and exhibited for the first time since 1958. Executed in vivid egg tempera, they explore the early history of the United States, from the American Revolution through the end of the War of 1812.\n\nAs the struggle for equal rights accelerated in the South, Lawrence, whose work was more typically inspired by personal experience and family history - his own parents were among the thousands who traveled north seeking employment during the Great Migration - turned his attention to the first few decades of the nation.\n\nWhat possibilities did Lawrence see in this history? He began work on the series in 1954, the same year the United States Supreme Court ruled to desegregate American schools in Brown v. Board of Education , precipitating a violent backlash in southern states. In this context, what is striking about Lawrence's paintings is that they offer an integrated vision of revolutionary struggle.\n\nAn early image in the series centers Crispus Attucks, a dockworker of African and Native descent who is thought to have been the first colonial to die in the revolution. As the wounded Attucks crumples to the ground, clutching his chest, his co-conspirators react in anger and horror.\n\nAnother painting represents a violent battle between red-coated Hessians and the Continental Army. Amid a frenzied snarl of angled limbs and interlocking bayonets, a mounted white officer and black soldier suffer the same fate, both reeling backward from bloody head wounds.\n\nIn this painting and throughout the series, Lawrence makes a point of centering black people in his scenes of early American history. Today, such images might suggest a Hamilton-style recasting of history - a hollow multiculturalism in the service of a hollow patriotism, sounding alarm bells for those of us rightly skeptical of neoliberalism's cooptation of the aesthetics of diversity. Lawrence's concern, however, was with historical fidelity, which he deployed as a corrective to segregated mainstream history.\n\nLawrence prepared to paint Struggle by consulting sources at Harlem's Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. His question, as he posed it in a later interview, was \"how...and to what degree the Negro had participated in American history.\" His research turned up not only information on identifiable figures like Attucks, but on the nine thousand persons of African descent who served in the colonial army, some of whom enlisted as free men, and others of whom were promised freedom for their military service.\n\nPerhaps inspired by W. E. B. Du Bois , whom he cites admiringly in the same interview, Lawrence drew from alternative sources to craft a revisionist history of the nation's formation. Much as Du Bois does in Black Reconstruction 's account of the Civil War's \"general strike,\" in which enslaved men and women depleted the economic power of the Confederacy and secured a Union victory by emancipating themselves from plantation labor, Lawrence restores agency to black people and highlights their largely unrecognized contributions to the revolutionary cause.\n\nThe persistent framing of African-American history as lying outside of United States history did and still casts black people as \"exceptions,\" exempt from historic promises of liberty and equality. By desegregating the mainstream American narrative of the period, Lawrence repudiated both radical and reactionary separatist efforts to divorce black Americans from the nation's past and difference them in its present.\n\nStruggle 's omissions are as revealing as its inclusions. Unlike mainstream accounts of the American Revolution, which present the war and its outcome as largely the result of the goings and doings of wealthy white gentlemen in tri-corner hats, the founding fathers are almost entirely absent from Lawrence's series.\n\nEven if the exact date doesn't ring a bell, the events of December 27, 1776 have been seared into the American unconscious thanks in large part to Emanuel Leutze's painting Washington Crossing the Delaware . Against a dramatic sunrise sky, Leutze's Washington, flanked by a billowing flag, assumes an epic posture, gazing steadfastly forward with one foot on the prow of the boat.\n\nIn contrast, Lawrence gives us huddled forms in blood-spattered boats, whose hunched postures resemble the cold and choppy waves through which they struggle to row.\n\nIn Struggle , as the series' title suggests, the work of revolution and nation-building is undertaken by anonymous figures participating in a collective project. While some framings characterize the American Revolution as a fight between British and colonial elites vying for economic power, Lawrence emphasizes the role of the workingmen, tenant farmers, and salaried laborers who attended radical meetings, formed militias, and enlisted to fight for national self-determination, political democracy, an end to privileges of rank, and material improvements to their lives, like land reform.\n\nInstead of handing the credit to the founding fathers, Lawrence, like socialist revolutionaries from Eugene Debs to Lenin , claimed America, and the principles of democracy and freedom, as the product of collective struggle.\n\nAlthough Lawrence portrays the contribution of black people to the American side of the conflict , his series makes no reference to the 20,000 black men who fought for the British , many of whom were also fugitive slaves promised freedom by the crown. By keeping the focus on American history, Lawrence avoids asking whether the cause for which black soldiers were prepared to fight and die was freedom from British tyranny or from slavery.\n\nElsewhere in the series, however, Lawrence brings these tensions to the fore. By creating an assemblage of paintings representing figures from different social groups, economic classes, and racial backgrounds, he asks viewers to grapple with the contradictions that shaped the early history of the United States, among them the irreconcilable oppositions between liberty and (human) property, and between American independence and Native sovereignty.\n\nLawrence juxtaposes the indigenous fight against colonial encroachment with American protests against British imperialism. In his depiction of the Boston Tea Party, Lawrence chooses to emphasize a lesser-known detail about the event: that the protesters were dressed as Indians.\n\nBy representing the colonists in face paint and feathers, he places this scene in dialogue with a later painting representing the Battle of Tippecanoe, where similarly-dressed members of the Native confederation led by Shawnee chief Tecumseh fight with American soldiers in a bid of resistance against westward expansion. By counterposing these competing and incompatible claims to sovereignty, Lawrence highlights the hypocrisy of the colonial demand for self-determination.\n\nMost of Struggle 's paintings are titled with excerpts from primary sources, including letters, popular songs, and military reports. By quoting from these documents, Lawrence gives voice to the contradictions that define this period. It is certainly no accident that the very first painting in the series takes its title from Patrick Henry's 1775 address to the Second Virginia Convention: \"Is life so dear or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery?\"\n\nLawrence literalizes this rhetorical complaint of enslavement in his portrayals of actual antislavery struggles. One of the series' most harrowing images depicts such an uprising.\n\nDark brown bodies, shackled but nude, meet the clothed forms of lighter-colored figures at the painting's vertical axis in a spasm of violence. This unidentified revolt, which stands in for thousands of forgotten bids for freedom, should be seen as just as critical to the formation of the United States as the crossing of the Delaware, or the Constitutional Convention.\n\nLawrence returns to this theme later in the series in a painting in which four men, two black and two white, are shown locked in violent combat. Deep gouges, which Lawrence created by scraping away at the paint with a sharp tool, mar the back of one of the black men - maybe wounds inflicted during this fight or older remnants of the lash. This painting follows immediately after one entitled \"Peace,\" referring to the Treaty of Ghent and the end of the War of 1812 - a reminder while an international war had ended, an internal fight for freedom continued.\n\nLawrence's title for this painting seems almost a response to Patrick Henry's earlier incitement of revolution. Taken from a letter written in 1810 by Captain James, an enslaved man who was planning a revolt, it reads, \"for freedom we want and will have, for we have served this cruel land long enuff.\"\n\nBy placing the fight for black liberation in dialogue with the themes of the American Revolution, Lawrence asserts the significance of the struggle against monarchic colonial rule and for liberty and equality while still demanding an answer to the question, as Frederick Douglass posed it , \"What, to the slave, is the fourth of July?\" His intervention represents black history not as a particularist \"special interest,\" but as an integral component of an ongoing democratic endeavor.\n\nLawrence originally envisioned Struggle as a larger project. A grant application, which was on view alongside the series at the Metropolitan Museum of Art last year, outlines his plan to represent much more of America's history, beginning with the founding of the Chesapeake Bay colonies and continuing through the end of World War I. The litany of events he saw as critical to this narrative makes it clear that for Lawrence, American history was not a triumphalist tale of victory, but an ongoing struggle to make the nation live up to its purported values.\n\nWe can only imagine how he would have, as he proposed, represented the experience of indentured servants, the growth of the plantation economy, settler-colonialism in the American West, the rise of the Ku Klux Klan, the meat-packing plants of Chicago and the steel mills of Pittsburgh, and the fight to establish labor unions.\n\nAs a single episode in this litany of events, Lawrence's American Revolution recalls Marxist analysis. The conflict was an unfinished attempt at revolution, betrayed by elite efforts to limit popular democracy and protect chattel slavery, which nevertheless represented a significant step toward freedom.\n\nAlthough Lawrence was one of the most successful black artists of his day, he couldn't secure funding to complete the series as he intended. Nor was he able to publish Struggle, as he had hoped, or to find a single buyer for the complete set of paintings. Despite his wish to keep the series united, his paintings were dispersed, and some were lost.\n\nWhy this lack of interest? Were funders, gallerists, and art collectors skeptical of Lawrence's integrated narrative of revolution and nation-building? Were they uncomfortable with his exploration of the contradictions inherent in the American endeavor? Or was American history perhaps considered an inappropriate subject for a black artist?\n\nLawrence, like many of his peers, expressed frustration with the art world's tacit insistence that black artists focus exclusively on \"black\" themes, a ghettoization that limited opportunities and resulted in the de facto segregation of museum and gallery exhibitions. In addressing national and universal concerns, Lawrence ventured beyond the narrow set of topics - Harlem neighborhoods, jazz clubs, cotton plantations - which had become synonymous with blackness in mid-century American culture. By doing so, he opened up new territory in American history and staked a claim for himself and for black Americans.\n\nStruggle: From the History of the American People will be on view at the Seattle Art Museum from March 5 through May 23 and at the Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C. from June 26 to September 1, 2021. The series was previously on view at the Peabody Essex Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Birmingham Museum of Art.\n\nThe complete series can also be seen online here .\n\nRachel Himes is a member of NYC-DSA and an incoming PhD student in the department of art history at Columbia.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

(Underwood Archives / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIn the fall of 1947, the Eagle Rock Council for Civic Unity scheduled a talk by Langston Hughes to be held at Occidental College's eight-hundred-seat Thorne Hall on March 31, 1948. But days before Hughes was scheduled to arrive on campus, the Los Angeles college's board of trustees hastily called a meeting and canceled his talk.\n\nHughes was one of America's most well-known black writers, with many volumes of poetry, short stories, magazine articles, radio scripts, a Broadway play, a Broadway musical, a Hollywood screenplay, song lyrics, and a popular newspaper column under his belt. But this was the dawn of McCarthyism, and when the trustees looked at Hughes, all they saw was a Red.\n\nThe incident illustrates how the insidious post-World War II Red Scare worked. In a period of escalating tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union, conservative politicians, newspapers, and others sought to frighten people into thinking that Communists were brainwashing Americans and subverting our democracy by infiltrating key institutions - chiefly labor unions, Hollywood and television, universities, and the media. They orchestrated investigations and hearings to identify so-called left-wing agitators. If those identified refused to comply - that is, to say that they were Communists and to inform on their radical friends - they would likely lose their livelihoods. Hollywood producers, TV and radio stations, record companies, colleges, local boards of education, book publishers, and concert halls fired or refused to hire those whose names appeared on notorious lists of so-called \"subversives.\"\n\nThe goal was not simply to root out Communists, but to scare Americans against criticizing American racism, foreign policy, and violations of workers' rights, among other concerns. The Red Scare sought not only to stifle the right to dissent but also the will to dissent by making certain critiques taboo. For example, in the 1949 film The Red Menace , Communists are depicted protesting at a real estate office - a not-so-subtle message that anyone who advocated for housing for veterans or black Americans, common activist issues at the time, must be a Communist.\n\nThe red-baiters particularly targeted civil rights and union activists, high school teachers, college faculty, writers, and performers by canceling their talks, books, performances, and even their passports. Race played an enormous role in the Red Scare. Prominent black figures who were investigated and blacklisted included Paul Robeson, W. E. B. Du Bois, Charlotta Bass, Canada Lee, Dorothy Dandridge, Sidney Poitier, Lena Horne, Richard Wright, Hazel Scott, Harry Belafonte, Ferdinand Smith, Alphaeus Hunton, Langston Hughes, and many others. In July 1949, the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) even held three days of hearings on \"Communist Infiltration of Minority Groups.\" As late as the 1960s, the FBI and right-wing groups were going after alleged Communists in the civil rights movement, including several close aides to Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nThe Hughes event in 1948, put on by the Eagle Rock Council, was intended to be a fundraiser to help pay the college costs for a local black female high schooler who wanted to attend Occidental (nicknamed \"Oxy\"), which had just admitted its first black student that year. The council had started after World War II, initially to help displaced Japanese-Americans return to their homes in greater Los Angeles and to challenge the image of Eagle Rock - the neighborhood where Occidental was located - as an \"all-white enclave.\" The council was one of several Los Angeles-based groups involved in a campaign to outlaw racial discrimination in housing at a time when doing so was highly controversial. It was affiliated with the American Council for Race Relations, a liberal but hardly left-wing group that sought to promote religious and racial tolerance.\n\nThe Hughes event at Occidental was set to go off without a hitch. But little did the organizers know that in the weeks leading up to the scheduled talk, State Senator Jack Tenney, chair of the legislature's Fact-Finding Committee on UnAmerican Activities, was completing an investigation into alleged subversives in California.\n\nOne week before the event, Tenney's committee issued a report describing Hughes as a Communist. Occidental officials were alarmed. They denied that Tenney had brought pressure to bear on the college, but president of the college, Arthur G. Coons, told the Los Angeles Times that, \"At this particular time, it is considered unwise to present anyone at a public meeting on the campus whose views are apt to be socially and politically divisive.\" Franklin P. Rush, president of the college's board of trustees, who was also the vice president and general manager of the Southern California Telephone Company, said that Hughes's views were \"not particularly loyal - at least not in line with Occidental's policy as a Christian college.\"\n\nThe red-baiters' goal was not merely to kill the careers of individual radicals, but to send a message through the media to the rest of the country. In this instance, Tenney got the headlines he was hoping for. The Los Angeles Times story was headlined \"Tenney Protests Poet's Billing As Oxy Cancels Date.\" The Sacramento Bee ran with \"Slated Appearance of Negro, Reported Red, Is Opposed.\" \"Occidental Calls Off Poet's Talk\" blared the Los Angeles Daily News . A few days later, the American Civil Liberties Union protested Occidental's action, but that news was ignored by most newspapers. One exception was the California Eagle , a progressive black-oriented paper based in Los Angeles, whose story warned of \"growing American fascism.\"\n\nLike many colleges Occidental, which was founded in 1887, had a long history of excluding black students. A 1939 editorial in the student newspaper the Occidental titled \"A Race Problem at Oxy\" pointed out that the college had not admitted one black student since its founding. Two years earlier, the editorial noted, a black student had been discouraged from applying because of fears no one would room with him and that \"his social life would be unhappily circumscribed. . . . That such a thing can happen is an admission that Oxy has something of a race problem.\" Ironically, Hughes spoke in Thorne Hall at Occidental on February 22, 1939, apparently without any controversy or incident.\n\nIn April 1947, James Dombrowski, a Methodist minister and executive director of the progressive civil rights organization the Southern Conference Educational Fund, spoke on campus. According to a story in the student newspaper, some students told him that the college had resisted admitting black students and that the college's fraternities and sororities were particularly opposed to the idea.\n\nThe following fall - four months after Jackie Robinson broke baseball's color barrier - Oxy admitted its first black student, George Ellison, the son of a Presbyterian minister from Philadelphia. But it was one thing to have a black student on campus. Inviting a black radical to speak to the student body and the wider community was, for some, a bridge too far.\n\nSince the 1920s, Hughes, an important figure in the Harlem Renaissance, had been one of the most prominent black writers in America. He published his first volume of poetry, The Weary Blues, in 1926 , and for the next two decades published a steady stream of novels, plays, operas, essays, memoirs, poems, and a syndicated newspaper column, making him a sought-after public speaker.\n\nHis 1926 essay \"The Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain,\" published in the Nation magazine when Hughes was only twenty-four, became a manifesto for him and other writers and activists who asserted racial pride. He wrote:\n\nThe younger Negro artists who create now intend to express our individual dark-skinned selves without fear or shame. If white people are pleased we are glad. If they are not, it doesn't matter. We know we are beautiful. And ugly, too. The tom-tom cries, and the tom-tom laughs. If colored people are pleased we are glad. If they are not, their displeasure doesn't matter either. We build our temples for tomorrow, strong as we know how, and we stand on top of the mountain free within ourselves.\n\nUpon graduation from Pennsylvania's Lincoln University in 1929, Hughes returned to New York and resumed his prolific career. His first novel Not Without Laughter , published in 1930, won the Harmon Gold Medal for Literature. Its central character is an African American boy, Sandy, caught between two worlds. Sandy's father is footloose and fun loving, while his mother works hard, demands respect, and appreciates the middle-class values of the white community around her. Through Sandy's eyes, Hughes reveals the conflicting values and attitudes within the black community, portraying the lives of the characters in intimate detail.\n\nSoon came Mule Bone , a 1931 play coauthored with Zora Neale Hurston, Popo and Fifina , a 1932 children's book, and The Dream Keeper , a 1932 collection of poems. In 1934, Hughes published a collection of short stories, The Ways of White Folks , about the humorous but ultimately tragic relationships between blacks and whites.\n\nIn his art Hughes portrayed the everyday lives of ordinary black people, including their joys, sorrows, music, humor, and routine encounters with racism. But unlike other prominent black poets of that era, such as Countee Cullen, Claude McKay, and Jean Toomer, Hughes sought to tell the stories of blacks in their own vernacular. This offended some middle-class black Americans who were embarrassed by Hughes's depictions.\n\nLike many Americans, Hughes was radicalized during the Depression, as he saw his family, friends, Harlem, and the country suffer. He developed close ties to the Communist Party (CP) and its orbit of people and organizations. The CP made a priority of organizing and recruiting black Americans and challenging racial segregation and discrimination in jobs, the military, housing, and the criminal justice system, including the persistence of lynching. For example, it raised money for the defense of the Scottsboro Boys, nine black teenage boys unfairly accused of rape in Alabama in 1931. It also sponsored protests and generally publicized the case, which became a national news story.\n\nThat year, Hughes wrote \"Christ in Alabama,\" a poem expressing his outrage at the racial injustice, ideas that he repeated during his speaking tour at black colleges and churches. Three years later, in an article for the Crisis , the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) magazine, Hughes published \"Cowards from the Colleges,\" criticizing the silence of black college and community leaders over the Scottsboro case.\n\nIn 1932, the Soviet Union invited Hughes and forty other black Americans to come make a film, Negro Life , about American racism. Although the film was never completed, Hughes was able to travel throughout the country, which strengthened his increasingly left-wing views and his criticism of the United States.\n\nIn 1935, in his speech to the First American Writers' Congress, a CP-sponsored group, Hughes said:\n\nNegro writers can seek to unite blacks and whites in our country, not on the nebulous basis of an interracial meeting, or the shifting sands of religious brotherhood, but on the solid ground of the daily working class struggle to wipe out, now and forever, all the old inequalities of the past.\n\nIn 1937, Hughes covered the Spanish Civil War for African American newspapers. His reporting reflected the American left's support for the popular forces resisting a takeover by fascist military strongman Francisco Franco.\n\nThe next year, a CP-sponsored group, the International Workers Order, published A New Song , a volume of Hughes's poems, some of which had already been published in the CP-sponsored journal New Masses . Many of the poems in the book reflected causes embraced by the Left in general and the Communist Party in particular. In \"Chant for Tom Mooney,\" Hughes took up the cause of the radical San Francisco labor leader who had been unfairly convicted of a 1916 bombing that killed ten people and whom the CP persistently advocated should be released from prison. Other poems in the collection, including \"Chant for May Day,\" \"Justice,\" \"Lynching Song,\" \"Open Letter to the South,\" \"Song of Spain,\" \"Negro Ghetto,\" \"Ballad of Ozzie Powell\" (one of the Scottsboro Boys), and \"Union,\" reflected Hughes's growing radical consciousness.\n\n\"I speak in the name of the black millions,\" Hughes wrote in the title poem, \"Awakening to Action.\" But he viewed their struggle not only as a battle against racism, but also as part of a crusade for economic justice and equality, writing, \" Revolt! Arise! The Black And White World Shall be one! The Worker's World! \"\n\nIn \"Let America Be America Again,\" originally published in Esquire and included in the collection, Hughes contrasts the nation's promise with its mistreatment of his fellow African Americans, the poor, Native Americans, workers, farmers, and immigrants. He hoped to see a day when America would no longer be divided by class and race divisions:\n\nO, let my land be a land where Liberty Is crowned with no false patriotic wreath, But opportunity is real, and life is free, Equality is in the air we breathe.\n\nNot surprisingly, Hughes was no stranger to controversy. For example, when he arrived at the Vista del Arroyo Hotel in Pasadena in November 1940 to discuss his new autobiography, The Big Sea , he was greeted by a large crowd carrying picket signs and a sound truck that played \"God Bless America\" adorned with a \"100 percent American\" banner. They were followers of evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson, who had denounced Hughes from her Angelus Temple pulpit as a \"radical and anti-Christ,\" and as a \"red devil in black,\" citing his 1932 poem, \" Goodbye Christ \" as evidence. The protest forced the hotel manager to cancel the event.\n\nHughes kept up his prolific writing pace throughout the 1940s, much of it tinged with left-wing ideas about racism and workers' rights. Though he lived in New York, he had many artistic and political ties in the Los Angeles area and frequently visited his local friends during his West Coast speaking tours.\n\nAfter he returned from his visit to the Soviet Union, he encouraged his friend Frances E. Williams, a black actress, to study theater in that country. She followed his advice and, once back in the United States, had a successful career as an actress and director. In 1941, Williams moved to Los Angeles, where she quickly became an activist in left-wing circles, befriending Charlotta Bass , publisher and editor of the California Eagle , the progressive black newspaper. Williams organized events, including plays, art exhibits, and other cultural exhibitions, and her home became a meeting place for leftist activists. In 1948, Williams became the first black woman to run for the California State Assembly , on the Progressive Party ticket. She was a leader of the new Screen Actors Guild union, Actors' Equity Association, and the National Negro Labor Council.\n\nIt is likely that Williams helped organize Hughes's speaking gigs in Los Angeles, which included his planned talk at Occidental in March 1948. Any California politician trying to identify so-called radical \"subversives\" wouldn't have to dig deep to turn up Williams, Bass, and their well-known friend Hughes.\n\nThroughout most of the 1930s, State Senator Tenney had been a leader in the musicians' union and a New Dealer. In 1936, he was elected to the California State Assembly as a Democrat. But he soon moved to the right, and in 1940, he was elected to the state senate as a Republican, serving for twelve more years. During his time in the state senate, he became the state's most high-profile anti-Communist, elevating his visibility by crusading against radicals within California's labor unions, universities, public schools, Hollywood, and other sectors. \"You can no more coexist with communism than you can coexist with a nest of rattlesnakes,\" Tenney proclaimed.\n\nIn 1940, Tenney cosponsored a bill to remove from the California ballot any political party with the word \"Communist\" in its title or that had any ties to the Communist Party. The bill passed and was reluctantly signed into law by Governor Culbert Olson. In 1941, he became chair of the newly formed Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities. This became his vehicle to gain public attention by investigating and attacking so-called \"subversives.\"\n\nTenney was in cahoots with California business leaders, who were worried about the public's support for labor unions, regulations, higher taxes on the rich, and the expansion of government social programs, including subsidized housing and health care. In 1941, soon after Walt Disney paid for an ad in Variety that blamed Communists for instigating a strike of his cartoonists , Tenney used his committee to launch a probe into \"Reds in movies.\" He didn't find any, but he grabbed lots of headlines.\n\nThroughout the 1940s, during hearings and when talking to the press, Tenney used phrases like \"Communist front\" and \"fellow traveler\" indiscriminately to stigmatize people involved in social causes and to paint as wholly Communist any liberal organization that had members with alleged ties to the CP. Tenney knew that he could generate more headlines by focusing on well-known public figures, so it should not be surprising that while his committee began a series of investigations of hundreds of alleged Communists, it included such well-known people as Robeson, writer-activist Carey McWilliams, housing advocate Catherine Bauer Wurster, labor organizer Luisa Moreno, actor Edward G. Robinson, and of course Hughes. By 1947, Congress was conducting its own investigation into Communists in Hollywood and other industries. Those and later hearings attracted media attention for politicians on the Senate and House witch-hunting committees.\n\nIn the years after World War II, Hughes was still a popular figure, giving talks at colleges, churches, community groups, libraries, literary clubs, and other venues. His speeches always included powerful denunciations of American racism. But by the middle of 1947, as the Red Scare escalated, Hughes had started to come under attack by veterans' groups and conservative radio commentators and columnists.\n\nIn a common tactic, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover began leaking information about Hughes's left-wing ties and his criticisms of organized religion to the press and to groups that had invited him to speak, many of which began to cancel his talks. In early March 1948, for example, the exclusive North Shore Country Day School outside Chicago canceled Hughes's talk after the Chicago Tribune ran a front-page story titled \"Red-Tinged Poet to Speak at Winnetka Private School.\"\n\nForeshadowing the censorship efforts of Sen. Joe McCarthy - and indeed those of current Florida governor Ron DeSantis - in early 1947, Tenney began an investigation into so-called \"subversive\" textbooks used in California's public schools. By subversive, Tenney and his anti-Communist allies meant books that dealt with issues such as slum housing, unfair labor practices, and racial and religious discrimination. This is the effort that first brought Hughes to Tenney's attention, as Hughes's stories and poems were taught in some California classrooms. Tenney sponsored a bill to forbid California's public schools from teaching \"un-American\" subjects and require them to teach \"Americanism\" as part of the curriculum.\n\nTenney's committee officially released its 448-page report on \"Communist Front Organizations\" on March 24, 1948. The report mentioned Hughes forty-six times, identifying a number of organizations that he was allegedly affiliated with - some true and others false. The report noted that \"Hughes may be said to rate with Paul Robeson as notorious Negro leaders in the Communist field.\"\n\nThe report mentioned that Hughes was scheduled to speak at Occidental the following week. A few days before the report's official release, on March 21, the Occidental board of trustees had canceled Hughes's talk, having no doubt been contacted by Tenney himself. The document trumpeted the about-face, saying, \"As this report goes to press, a spokesman for Occidental College announces that the institution has canceled Hughes's appearance.\" The Tenney report also attacked the Eagle Rock Council for Civic Unity, the group that had invited Hughes to speak at Occidental. The report noted that Jerome W. McNair, the council's program director, \"is affiliated with a number of Communist organizations including the American Civil Liberties Union and the American-Russian Institute.\"\n\nThe next week, Hughes gave two talks in Los Angeles, one sponsored by the League of Allied Art and the Unitarian Club, the other by the Beverly-Fairfax Jewish Community Center. But the following week, his scheduled talks at public schools in Palo Alto and Vallejo were canceled in response to veterans and church groups concerned about his \"possible Communistic connections.\"\n\nThe Hughes incident at Occidental was only one small part of Tenney's vigorous anti-Communist crusade. In 1949, Tenney drafted legislation to put a constitutional amendment on the state ballot that would give the legislature the authority to prohibit the University of California from hiring \"disloyal\" faculty. Fearful of Tenney's power, in 1950, the university's board of regents agreed to institute a \"loyalty oath\" for all faculty. Of the sixty-nine professors fired nationwide for political reasons during the Red Scare, almost half were from the University of California, most of them on the Berkeley and Los Angeles campuses, for refusing to sign the loyalty oath.\n\nBut Tenney's 1948 report, loyalty oath, and \"Americanism\" in schools campaigns were his last hurrah. In 1949, his state senate colleagues removed him as chair of the Un-American Activities Committee, in part for violating due process and in part because of the hundreds of people brought before his committee over eight years as so-called subversives, not one had been indicted, much less convicted. Tenney had done much to bring about the Red Scare, which would only intensify in the coming decade, but he'd done so at the cost of his personal ambitions. (The same eventually happened to Senator McCarthy, who was censured by his US Senate colleagues in 1954 for his recklessness, which soon destroyed his political career.)\n\nIn 1949, Tenney finished fourth in his campaign for Los Angeles mayor. In 1952, he lost his campaign for the US House of Representatives as well as his bizarre run for vice president of the United States on the right-wing Christian Nationalist Party. Two years later, he was defeated in the Republican primary for his own state senate seat. During the 1950s, he published several conspiratorial antisemitic books including Anti-Gentile Activity in America , Zion's Fifth Column, Zionist Network, and Zion's Trojan Horse. He wound up serving as part-time city attorney in Cabazon, a small town in the California desert. He died in 1970 at age seventy.\n\nDespite Tenney's political demise, his tactics inspired other politicians like McCarthy and Richard Nixon, who made names for themselves as anti-Communist Red-hunters as the Cold War intensified. In 1950, a group of former FBI agents, with help from the FBI and Congress's House Committee on Un-American Activities, issued a report titled \"Red Channels: The Report of Communist Influence in Radio and Television.\"\n\nIt listed 151 actors, writers, musicians, broadcast journalists, and others whom it claimed, often with dubious evidence at best, were part of the Communist influence in the entertainment industry - including actors Edward G. Robinson, Lee J. Cobb, Avon Long, and Orson Welles, writers Arthur Miller and Dashiell Hammett, and musical artists Leonard Bernstein, Pete Seeger, Josh White, Lena Horne, Aaron Copland, and Hughes. Many of of those listed in \"Red Channels\" were issued subpoenas to testify before Congress and blacklisted for refusing to cooperative with Congress's witch-hunt.\n\nIn its section on Hughes, the \"Red Channels\" report identified more than forty so-called subversive left-wing organizations and publications that Hughes had allegedly been affiliated with. These included the American Peace Mobilization, Friends of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, American Labor Party, International Labor Defense, Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee, League of American Writers, American Youth for Democracy, National Negro Congress, New Theatre League, National Council of Soviet-American Friendship, People's Songs, the New Masses , and the Daily Worker .\n\nIn 1953, McCarthy's Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations called Hughes to testify. Rather than defy the politicians, he chose to cooperate. He refused to name names, but he repudiated his past radical ideas. Under questioning from McCarthy and his top lawyer Roy Cohn (who would later be Donald Trump's lawyer), Hughes denied he had ever been a Communist Party member. He admitted that he once admired the Soviet Union, but said that he had become disillusioned years earlier. He claimed that his poem \"Goodbye Christ\" had been misunderstood and that he was neither an atheist nor anti-religious. He maintained that be believed in democracy and racial equality, and seemed to be criticizing McCarthyism itself, when he told the committee:\n\nI would like to see an America where people of any race, color, or creed may live on a plane of cultural and material well-being, cooperating together unhindered by sectarian, radical, or factional prejudices and harmful intolerances that do nobody any good, an America proud of its tradition, capable of facing the future without the necessary pitting of people against people and without the disease of personal distrust and suspicion of one's neighbor.\n\nHughes's cooperation with McCarthy's committee cost him his friendships with Robeson, Du Bois, and others who had defied the witch-hunters. Hughes severed his ties with several left-wing groups, including the American Labor Party and the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship, which the FBI, the Department of Justice, and Congressional Red-hunters viewed as Communist-led organizations. In 1959, when he published Selected Poems , he left out some of his more radical poems.\n\nWhether Hughes sincerely rejected his radical past or simply accommodated himself to the realities of being a black writer trying to make a living in Cold War America is unknown. Although he publicly abandoned many of his left-wing views, he continued to protest the social and racial conditions endured by African Americans and to promote black culture in his many works. He also continued to celebrate socialist and anti-colonial revolutions in Africa in his poetry. As Billie Anania has written for Jacobin, his later work \"continued to connect racist policing with US-backed dictators in the Third World and expressed solidarity with liberation movements in Cairo, Cape Town, and Angola.\"\n\nIn 1951, when he was still under assault by right-wingers, Hughes wrote \"Dream Deferred.\" The poem includes some of most well-known lines in American literature:\n\nWhat happens to a dream deferred? Does it dry up Like a raisin in the sun? Or fester like a sore- And then run? Does it stink like rotten meat? Or crust and sugar over- like a syrupy sweet? Maybe it just sags like a heavy load. Or does it explode?\n\nThe poem appeared to be a prediction of the coming civil rights movement - the sit-ins, voter registration drives, protest marches, and the urban rebellions of the 1950s and '60s.\n\nHe was already a well-respected writer, but the civil rights movement and the subsequent explosion of interest in black studies and black literature boosted his visibility, as his writings became widely read in high schools and colleges. He was often called the \"Poet Laureate of the Negro Race.\"\n\nDuring his lifetime, Hughes published fifteen volumes of poetry, ten novels and collections of short stories, twenty plays and operas, two autobiographies, four books about black history, hundreds of magazine articles and newspaper columns, and seven books for children, including books about Africa, the West Indies, jazz, and black history. He translated into English the works of the Spanish poet Federico García Lorca and the Latin American Nobel laureate poet Gabriela Mistral.\n\nHughes's racial consciousness and pride, as well as his depictions of black life, influenced later generations of artists and activists in Africa and the Caribbean as well as in the United States. During the 1960s, he inspired and supported many young black writers, helping shape a new wave of black literature. In his 1967 anthology The Best Short Stories by Negro Writers , Hughes included a short story by a then unknown Georgia-born writer, Alice Walker, a student at Sarah Lawrence College. \"His support for me meant more than I can say,\" recalled Walker, who has become one of her generation's most acclaimed writers.\n\nThe playwright Loften Mitchell, a generation younger than Hughes, said, \"Langston set a tone, a standard of brotherhood and friendship and cooperation, for all of us to follow. You never got from him, 'I am the Negro writer,' but only 'I am a Negro writer.' He never stopped thinking about the rest of us.\"\n\nBut even after he disavowed Communism, Hughes's work was still not immune from controversy. In 1965, the Boston school board fired twenty-eight-year-old teacher Jonathan Kozol for reading Hughes's poem \"The Ballad of the Landlord,\" which portrays the exploitation of black tenants by white landlords, to his black fourth-grade students, going outside the school's prescribed curriculum. Kozol described his experiences in the first of his many books, Death At An Early Age: The Destruction of the Hearts and Minds of Negro Children in the Boston Public Schools, which won the 1967 National Book Award.\n\nHughes was never invited back to speak at Occidental. But like other colleges, Oxy was shaped by the civil rights revolution and particularly by the 1965 uprising in Watts, a black part of Los Angeles. By the late 1960s and '70s, Oxy began to recruit more black, brown, and low-income students. In 1968, the college hired its first black faculty member, Mary Jane Hewitt, who offered the first courses in black literature and culture. Hewitt had a wide network of local and national black artists, musicians, and actors and was influential in providing Occidental students, especially the few black students on campus, with an understanding of black culture and the contributions of African Americans to American culture.\n\nOne of the students who came to Oxy in that period was Roger Guenveur Smith, who graduated in 1977. Smith recalls walking into one of Hewitt's classes one day and finding the professor talking with writers Maya Angelou and James Baldwin, and actor Roscoe Lee Browne. In one course with Hewitt, Smith wrote a paper about Hughes. For his senior project, he created and performed \"An Evening with Frederick Douglass,\" the first in a series of biographically and historically infused plays which have become his signature as an award-winning actor, playwright, and director. He's returned to the campus several times to teach and perform.\n\nIn 1979, a black student from Hawaii, then known as Barry Obama, arrived on campus. Two years later, he gave his first political speech at an anti-apartheid rally on campus. Rumor has it that he achieved some success after college. Several years ago, the college inaugurated a scholarship program named for Obama for students interested in public service careers.\n\nAmong the nation's top liberal arts colleges, Occidental is now considered among the most progressive in terms of its curriculum and commitment to racial and economic diversity - although, like its counterparts, its students and faculty often complain that it doesn't always live up to this promise. Surely there's much room for improvement. But today, several Occidental faculty teach courses that require students to read the writings of Langston Hughes.\n\nPeter Dreier teaches political science at Occidental College.

White / US National Archives\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nLiza Bramlett was a slave. She lived on a cotton plantation in the Mississippi Delta during the nineteenth century. White men raped her repeatedly throughout her life. They traded her body amongst themselves in exchange for calves and piglets. In the end, Liza gave birth to twenty-three children, twenty of whom were conceived by rape.\n\nOne of Liza's daughters, Ella Townsend, was born after emancipation, but remained in the bondage of sharecropping in rural Mississippi. As an adult, she carried a pistol with her in the fields, determined to protect herself and the surrounding children. One day, a white man on horseback rode into the fields. He had come to abduct a young black girl.\n\nElla, carrying her pistol in a lunch pail, intervened. \"You don't have no black children and you're not going to beat no black children,\" she told the intruder. \"If you step down off that horse, I'll go to Hell and back with you before Hell can scorch a feather.\"\n\n\"I do not believe that we can stop them ... because they must ultimately stop themselves,\" Ta-Nehisi Coates says of white racists in the final paragraph of his bestseller Between the World and Me, written as an open letter to his son . Coates describes racism as galactic, a physical law of the universe, \"a tenacious gravity\" and a \"cosmic injustice.\"\n\nWhen a cop kills a black man, the police officer is \"a force of nature, the helpless agent of our world's physical laws.\" Society is equally helpless against the natural order. \"The earthquake cannot be subpoenaed,\" says Coates.\n\nIn a widely replicated gesture, Coates locates the experience of racism in the body, in a racism that \"dislodges brains, blocks airways, rips muscle, extracts organs, cracks bones, breaks teeth.\" In the slim volume, fewer than two hundred pages, the word \"body\" or \"bodies\" appears more than three hundred times. \"In America,\" he writes, \"it is traditional to destroy the black body.\" Another brooding passage dwells on the inevitability of this violence.\n\nIt had to be blood. It had to be nails driven through a tongue and ears pruned away. It had to be the thrashing of a kitchen maid for the crime of churning the butter at a leisurely clip. It could only be the employment of carriage whips, tongs, iron pokers, handsaws, stones, paperweights or whatever might be handy to break the black body.\n\nYet Coates's descriptive language and haunting narrative are not mere metaphors. They act as a kind of ontological pivot, mystifying racism even as it is anchored in its physical effects.\n\nMetaphor has long been used to capture racism's almost unimaginable brutality. Lynching became \"strange fruit\" in Abel Meerpool's song, made famous by Billie Holiday. In a wry, tragic innuendo, rape was referred to in Black communities as \"nighttime integration.\" The use of metaphor is not in itself an obfuscation. But Coates wields metaphor to obscure rather than illuminate the reality of racism.\n\nWhat we find all too often in Coates's narrative universe are bodies without life and a racism without people. To give race an ontological meaning, to make it a reality all its own, is to drain it of its place in history and its roots in discrete human action. To deny the role of life and people - of politics - as Coates does is to also foreclose the possibility of liberation.\n\nElla knew her mother Liza's unimaginable suffering, but her memory was not a yoke on her shoulders. It provoked something in Ella.\n\nAs an adult, she did not see the white predator stalking the fields as some helpless agent. She took matters into her own hands. There was no gravity strong enough to break her will or loosen her grip on her pistol. Her efforts rippled beyond those cotton fields.\n\nElla taught her own daughter, Fannie Lou Hamer, not only to struggle, but to resist.\n\nFannie Lou was born into a sharecropping family in rural Mississippi but would go on to become a beacon of the Civil Rights movement. She is best known for her work registering black voters in Mississippi, most famously during 1964's Freedom Summer, at great personal risk.\n\nPolice arrested and beat her. White racists shot at her. Lyndon Johnson dismissed her as an illiterate. In 1973, an interviewer asked her, \"Do you have faith that the system will ever work properly?\" By then, Fannie Lou had seen a decade of setbacks and false dawns since first walking off her plantation in 1962 to fight for Civil Rights. She responded,\n\nWe have to make it work. Ain't nothing going to be handed to you on a silver platter. That's not just black people, that's people in general, masses. See, I'm with the masses... You've got to fight. Every step of the way you've got to fight.\n\nShe marched. She sang freedom songs. She testified. She co-founded the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party. For her, the logical solution was political: uniting a powerless many against a powerful few. White racists could be stopped. Black people could resist, and Fannie Lou and so many others did just that.\n\nFannie Lou knew that the wages of racism were measured on the body. \"A black woman's body was never hers alone,\" she once remarked. White doctors sterilized her without her consent during a minor surgery, a barbaric intrusion so common she called it a \"Mississippi appendectomy.\" However, though she knew racism's physical toll, she drew inspiration from stories of black resistance passed down orally across the generations. Hamer recalled her grandmother's will to survive and her mother's weapon of protection.\n\nThese intergenerational resistance narratives, according to Charles Cobb in his book This Nonviolent Stuff'll Get You Killed , \"underlay a deep and powerful collective memory that was invisible to whites but greatly affected the shape and course of the modern Freedom Movement.\" As a result, Fannie Lou and so many others possessed an intimate knowledge not only of their own human dignity, despite the racist brutality they endured, but also of the human frailty of their racial oppressors.\n\nIn the years before Fannie Lou's political struggle began, whole communities, black women and men, rose up against the violence that was forced on black women's bodies. Feminist historian Danielle McGuire argues this anti-rape community organizing in Alabama laid the foundation for what eventually became the Montgomery Bus Boycott. She observes, \"The majority of leaders active in the Montgomery Improvement Association in 1955 cut their political teeth demanding justice for black women who were raped in the 1940s and early 1950s.\"\n\nDespite being a poor, black sharecropper drowning in the poverty and racial terror endemic to rural Mississippi, Fannie Lou held fast to her forbearers' stories of resistance. She did not resign herself to fatalism, as Coates does.\n\nCoates too takes a multigenerational view. Between the World and Me is framed as a letter to his son. However, rather than seeing a legacy of resistance, he finds a lineage of blackness defined by fear and dysfunction.\n\n\"When I was your age the only people I knew were black, and all of them were powerfully, adamantly, dangerously afraid,\" he writes. \"I felt the fear in the visits to my Nana's home in Philadelphia,\" Coates continues. \"And I saw it in my own father.\"\n\nMy father was so very afraid. I felt it in the sting of his black leather belt, which he applied with more anxiety than anger, my father who beat me as if someone might steal me away, because that is exactly what was happening all around us.\n\nCoates describes his condition, and that of all black people, as a \"birthmark of damnation.\"  The resistance stories passed down to Fannie Lou and so many others spurred them to march. Coates's narrative, riddled with fear and futility, begs us to retreat.\n\nThough Coates has never explicitly cited it as his theoretical framework, the dour outlook of his work evokes the themes of Afro-Pessimism . The pivot to the ontological that is apparent in Coates's rhetoric is a hallmark of Afro-Pessimism.\n\n\"Ontology by definition is the study of being, and to speak of Blackness as an ontological condition means analyzing the state of Black bodies through the lens of slavery,\" Afro-Pessimist scholar Michael Barlow, Jr., writes in the academic journal Inquiries . However, for Barlow, the relation of slavery that ontologically defines blackness is not a matter of political economy, but rather a \"libidinal economy.\"\n\nIn this telling, labor and ownership - that is, political economy - are merely incidental to racial slavery. Instead, it's the white imagination and its depraved \"metaphysical desires for Black flesh\" that both predated and catalyzed racialized chattel slavery.\n\nRacism is reduced to the spiritual, more a matter of a sinful nature than a political struggle. Coates has echoed this retreat to interiority, to the spiritual, to consciousness.\n\nIt's the ontological pivot that leads Frank Wilderson, perhaps the world's foremost Afro-Pessimist, to declare in his foundational text \"Gramsci's Black Marx: Whither the Slave in Civil Society?\" that black people are no more than cows in a slaughterhouse. Wilderson posits that \"death of the black body is foundational to the life of American civil society,\" just as a cow's death is essential to the slaughterhouse.\n\nFlippantly, Wilderson asks, \"how would the cows fare under a dictatorship of the proletariat?\" Coates adopts a similar sense of impotence. He characterizes struggle as aimless toil - an apolitical end in itself.\n\n\"The struggle is really all I have for you,\" he tells his son, \"because it is the only portion of this world under your control.\" Yet how are we to struggle against earthquakes and physical laws? How can we fight gravity?\n\nBoth Coates and Wilderson speak of power in terms of dreams. Coates writes of monolithic white \"Dreamers,\" those whose investment in the American Dream requires a faith in their own whiteness.\n\nSimilarly, Wilderson sees America as enacting two distinct dreams. For Wilderson, \"the dream of black accumulation and death\" is separate from \"the dream of worker exploitation.\" Ultimately, in both Coates's and Wilderson's respective frameworks, solidarity is unimaginable and class struggle is rendered futile.\n\nThough Coates does not go to the lengths Wilderson does to position himself in opposition to materialist politics, the result is effectively equivalent: a separation of race and class combined with a deep skepticism of class-based solidarity, reforms, or even revolution.\n\nThis is a turn away from the Freedom Tradition embodied by Fannie Lou Hamer. For her, the problem of racism wasn't cosmology or ontology - it was an expression of politics implicated in class antagonism. Fannie Lou Hamer stood \"with the masses,\" both white and black. Solidarity through struggle from below, including class struggle, formed her path to victory.\n\nCoates's ontological pivot is more muddled than Wilderson's. Fleetingly peppered throughout his work are allusions to material reality, betraying the imposition of metaphysical abstraction that ultimately drives his perspective. \"We did not choose our fences,\" he writes. \"They were imposed on us by Virginia planters obsessed with enslaving as many Americans as possible.\" Coates knows that Virginia planters did not invent gravity or earthquakes. Yet this historicizing impulse does not prevent him from essentializing racism when he confronts it head on.\n\nIn string of tweets from December 2016, Coates conceded that racism is not transcendental, noting that \"at its very root it was always economic.\" But acknowledging racism's economic impact has not led him to embrace class struggle. Even Frank Wilderson can acknowledge that racism has an economic impact, but he still believes that class struggle and racism exist on distinct planes.\n\nCoates holds a similar belief; that racism is wholly different in kind from class. In the same series of tweets, he concluded that \"in America, 'class' isn't the only kind of class.\"\n\nJust as he mystifies racism, even while locating its impact in the bodies of black people, here he again pivots. Coates cannot address material politics on its own terms, preferring instead to retreat to a contrived mystification. He replaces action with interiority.\n\nAs he recently told an auditorium of eager Northwestern students, \"The process should not be... people looking out at the world and saying, 'I would like for there to be change in the world, how do I do that?'\" Instead, he implored the crowd to engage from the \"inside-out, not outside-in... because if you are in the business of justice, and making this society more democratic, you might get a lot of disappointment.\"\n\nConsciousness matters, of course. \"Baby you just got to love 'em,\" Fannie Lou Hamer would say of the white segregationists who routinely threatened her life. \"Hating just makes you sick and weak.\" This was Hamer in a reflexive moment, but it was no retreat. In the very next breath, she warned, \"I keep a shotgun in every corner of my bedroom and the first cracker even look like he wants to throw some dynamite on my porch won't write his mama again.\"\n\nFannie Lou truly was her mother's daughter. Reflection, whether through intergenerational story or her own thoughts, enhanced her resistance.\n\nThe same cannot be said of Coates. Instead of finding relief in political action, Coates finds it in a cookout at Howard University's homecoming, surrounded by black people. He fantasizes that he is \"disappearing into all of their bodies,\" as the music and dancing, the black cultural zeitgeist of the moment, cure him of the \"birthmark of damnation.\"\n\nThe curse is lifted. Blackness is transfigured, becoming a space \"beyond the Dream.\" It's another ontological pivot, this time allowing Coates to conclude that The Mecca's\" - his term for Howard - cookout has a \"power more gorgeous than any voting rights bill.\"\n\nIt's a fantasy of retreat, as if black culture were beyond the machinations of capitalism, as though black cultural expression existed in the world but was not of it and were enough to take us to a new one.\n\nBetween the World and Me concludes with Coates considering climate change. He sees climate change as a manifestation of a polluted white consciousness, rather than the unfettered excess of industrial capitalism. It is a \"noose around the neck of the earth,\" allegedly resulting in large part from white flight, the mid-century exodus of negrophobic white families to the suburbs and the pollution caused by the cars that took them there.\n\nCoates's words here are poetic but grossly inaccurate. They mimic Afro-Pessimism's emphasis on the white libido, relegating his rhetoric to the realm of interior life, the souls of white folks, and stopping well short of the political domain.\n\nFor Coates, the Civil Rights movement was not a struggle to alter a material world; rather the \"hope of the movement\" was merely to \"awaken the Dreamers.\" Black politics is only relevant as far as it can arouse white consciousness, which he sees as a largely futile exercise, due to \"the small chance of the Dreamers coming into consciousness.\"\n\nCoates sees common interest between the black elite and the black poor, as he marvels at \"the entire diaspora,\" from lawyers to street hustlers, present at Howard's homecoming. Yet he cannot conceive of anti-capitalist class solidarity across racial identity. He has a darker vision, of a kind that Corey Robin has described as \"apocalypticism.\" Coates's ultimate hope is not in collective human action, but rather the total annihilation of the world and all those living in it- another feature that unites him with Afro-Pessimism, which calls explicitly for the \"end of the world.\"\n\nAs he says of the Dreamers, \"the field for their Dream, the stage where they have painted themselves white, is the deathbed of us all.\" Paradoxically, though he can see a collective fate in apocalypse, he rejects shared struggle for liberation. \"The Dreamers will have to learn to struggle themselves,\" he declares.\n\nThe problem is, the whole of capitalist enterprise, both past and present, cannot be reduced to race as Original Sin. Left out of Coates's mythology is the fact that colonial enterprise, in what would become the United States, relied first on European indentured servants, most of whom died within a handful of years after arriving on the continent.\n\nIt's Coates's reading of race as sin that pushes him to imagine a perverted form of salvation in the fantasy of apocalypse. In this racial fatalism, reparations for slavery emerges as the anticipation of the inevitable Judgement Day. It is therefore no surprise that Coates has taken up racial reparations as his cross to bear - not to change the world, but to condemn it.\n\nFor the better part of two years, Ta-Nehisi Coates has been the most visible and combative supporter of reparations in politics. Coates calls reparations \"the indispensable tool against white supremacy.\"\n\nIn 2016's \" My President Was Black \" and \" Better Is Good ,\" Coates refers to the \"moral logic\" of reparations. They are a measure that could atone for what he called in 2014's \" The Case for Reparations ,\" the \"sin of national plunder.\"\n\nThere he claimed that the nation owes a \"moral debt\" that must be remedied by the \"spiritual renewal\" that reparations would facilitate. Reparations for slavery is Coates's ontological pivot fully realized.\n\nThese days, we find Coates touring prestigious universities and making his case for reparations in keynote addresses to packed auditoriums.\n\n\"I think every single one of these universities needs to make reparations,\" Coates said to thunderous applause at a March 3 conference at Harvard University. The day-long conference, \"Universities and Slavery: Bound By History,\" began with Harvard's president admitting that the university \"was directly complicit in slavery from the college's earliest days in the 17th century.\"\n\nCoates pushed the university to \"use the language of reparation\" as a measure that would \"acknowledge that something was done.\" Though Harvard acknowledged its history, no race-specific remedy was forthcoming.\n\nLast fall, Georgetown did Harvard one better. They not only used the language of reparations; the school also put forward a program of financial and symbolic atonement. The university admitted to selling slaves in 1838, \"a transaction that helped save Georgetown from financial ruin.\"\n\nIn 2015 Georgetown convened a commission to \"reflect upon our University's history and involvement in the institution of slavery.\" The commission recommended granting preferential admission for descendants of the 272 slaves the university sold two centuries ago, in addition to gestures like changing the names of campus buildings from those of slavemasters to those of slaves and free people of color.\n\nGeorgetown's example is the closest actualization of reparations policy that has taken place during Coates's three years of evangelizing. Coates said of the plan , \"folks may not like the word 'reparations,' but it's what Georgetown did. Scope is debatable. But it's reparations.\"\n\nCoates wants \"special acknowledgment\" from above, in the service of spiritual renewal - which explains his penchant for means-tested trickle-down anti-racism. But if he had faith in \"the masses,\" as Fannie Lou Hamer did, he'd see that the renewal and acknowledgement he seeks comes from below, from class solidarity in the struggle for universal emancipation.\n\nHarvard has a $37 billion endowment. Mere months before Coates's appearance, dining workers at the school were locked in a protracted battle for a living wage . Many of these workers are themselves descendants of slaves, but the university was unmoved by their struggle. The dining workers spent the better part of a month on strike , before finally forcing Harvard to concede to their demands.\n\nThe university was quicker to take the less expensive measure of admitting that the school was complicit in seventeenth century slavery than it was to pay its workers fairly today.\n\nI'm a former staffer for UNITE HERE, a hospitality union. Last year, I worked on a campaign in a multiethnic, multiracial university cafeteria in Chicago. The campaign's primary demands were for wage increases and healthcare, using the slogan \"Dignity and a Doctor.\" Negotiations with the subcontractor had stalled, and strike preparations were under way. Pressures ran high. Workers were afraid. However, just as stories catalyzed resistance for Civil Rights leaders, stories anchored the worker organizing in our campaign.\n\nThough workers' struggles with poverty wages and a lack of health coverage were crucial, one story stood out above the others. Workers continually shared stories that their Chinese colleagues were being abused for speaking Chinese on the shop floor. Managers would walk past, and upon hearing Chinese, they'd smack the speaker on the back of the head commanding the worker to \"speak English!\"\n\nMost of the workers were people of color, but the majority were not Chinese. The largest plurality in the workplace was made up of African-Americans, virtually all of whom only spoke English. But everyone could identify with the indignity of the story, the asymmetrical relations that empowered the bosses to abuse any one of them for any reason.\n\nWorkers from a whole range of identities fought in solidarity with the Chinese workers. Discrimination on the basis of language became a central demand in the broader campaign. The campaign attached the specificity of the Chinese workers' situation to all the workers' common struggle against the boss.\n\nThis form of class struggle was not enough to overcome racism the world over. But it did give a brief glimpse of solidarity across backgrounds and experiences through acknowledging the shared indignity of class exploitation.\n\nIn the end, the workers won. As the campaign victories were listed, the excitement in the room was overwhelming, a type of energy that I'd only ever felt at a particularly intense church service or while attending a high-stakes game in a packed stadium. The organizer announced that healthcare had been won. We clapped. We celebrated as the wage increases were added up.\n\nBut when the organizer revealed that the contract guaranteed the right to speak non-English languages in the workplace, the room erupted. The black workers were palpably just as invested as the Chinese workers, and everyone was ecstatic.\n\nBecause he fails to deeply consider what real, material resistance of the masses might look like, the kind that guided Fannie Lou Hamer, Coates ends up idealizing racism. He evokes metaphors of earthquakes and physical laws to describe its magnitude.\n\nBut for the workers in that university cafeteria, racism was a smack from a boss. For millions of poor black people, racism is the corrosive water pipes poisoning their bodies. School closures, crumbling and unstable housing, and all the intimately practical things necessary for everyday life are the measure of racism.\n\nThese racist realities are not separable from questions of class. In fact, they are expressions of class politics. The racialized tragedies faced daily by people of color require us to embrace class struggle, not Coates's demobilizing metaphysical maxims about how white people \"must ultimately stop themselves.\"\n\nSolidarity from below, between cafeteria workers, truck drivers, secretaries, and any number of everyday people is worth magnitudes more than the kind of special acknowledgement from elites that Coates is after. This solidarity through shared struggle, as Fannie Lou Hamer recognized, is the foundation for social transformation.\n\nWhere Coates would have us retreat, she called on us to march. She knew that the only way to defeat racism was to fight it, every step of the way.\n\nFirst published at Viewpoint .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Promoting a jobs program, Bernie Sanders's critics chided, won't stop racial profiling. Fighting economic exploitation, naysayers maintain, won't bludgeon the fortress of white supremacy.\n\nNone of this would have made much sense to the National Negro Congress (NNC). Founded in February 1936, the NNC sought to build a mass antiracist coalition rooted in the labor movement that could attack racial hierarchy and the economic exploitation that undergirded it. Their goal was nothing less than the evisceration of Jim Crow and the elevation of black Americans to \"first-class\" citizenship - fulfilling the dreams of an egalitarian, interracial democracy first glimpsed in the Reconstruction era .\n\nWeathering geopolitical machinations (which triggered a split in 1940), the NNC notched some notable victories before being done in by Cold War red-baiting. And despite its short life, the civil rights group has much to tell us about how to fight white supremacy.\n\nJacobin editor Shawn Gude recently caught up with Erik Gellman, historian and author of Death Blow to Jim Crow: The National Negro Congress and the Rise of Militant Civil Rights , to talk about the NNC's mass-based organizing and its relevance to struggles today for a \" Third Reconstruction .\"\n\nWhat was the National Negro Congress, and what was their strategy for challenging Jim Crow racism and racial hierarchy in the US?\n\nThe National Negro Congress was a civil rights organization that developed out of a conference at Howard University. That 1935 gathering featured a number of prominent black intellectuals and activists such as A. Philip Randolph , John P. Davis , and James Ford . The organization started in earnest with its first convening conference in Chicago in February 1936. Hundreds of delegates from different associations came together to foment what Richard Wright described at that gathering as a \"Negro Bill of Rights.\" In the midst of the Great Depression, they sought to devise new methods of racial advancement and to revive a radical strain of the Black Freedom Movement .\n\nThe NNC's leaders conceived of the Congress as an organization of organizations. There were a lot of groups in black communities nationwide, and they wanted to capture all of this energy in order to wield power as a formidable partner within the emerging Popular Front coalition of the late 1930s.\n\nHow was the NNC different from other civil rights groups?\n\nThey were much more interested in class dynamics. They thought that working-class, labor-based activism had more potential than the welfare capitalism or Garveyite black nationalism that dominated in the 1920s.\n\nAnother difference was their attention to international anticolonial and antiracist networks. They were alarmed at the spread of fascism around the world - the invasion of Ethiopia by Mussolini, the Spanish Civil War , and Hitler coming to power - and they believed that broad coalitions were necessary to fight fascism in all forms.\n\nThat strategy set them apart from groups like the NAACP or the Urban League, which sought more polite negotiations and favored the \" talented tenth \" approach of highlighting the most educated and elite African Americans. The NNC wanted to foment resistance from the working class.\n\nMore specifically, it placed black organizers in the emerging industrial union movement. It partnered with the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) to organize steel, packing, tobacco, auto, and other factory workers. The NNC and its southern youth offshoot, the Southern Negro Youth Congress (SNYC) also highlighted female leadership, with prominent activists such as Thelma Dale (Perkins) , Esther Cooper Jackson , Dorothy Burnham , Marie Richardson , and many others leading the charge in cultural, political, and economic campaigns, especially during the Second World War.\n\nWhat did they see as the connection between economic exploitation and racism in the US?\n\nThey thought that racism was the key divider of the labor movement in America. Racism not only kept African Americans from succeeding and thriving, but it prevented white workers from unionizing and achieving economic security.\n\nThey also saw several emerging opportunities to build a broader, class-based movement. The Popular Front, which was coming together in 1935, drew together many groups that were fighting for a more progressive and radical expansion of the New Deal. There was also a new union movement, the CIO, which advocated a broader industrial unionism. To the extent that \" civil rights unionism \" (a term employed by Robert Korstad ) did develop, the NNC's network was a key catalyst.\n\nThe NNC also reinterpreted American history by placing African Americans at the center rather than the margins. They argued that black workers were key agents of cooperative American values and protest traditions. In this interpretation, they appealed to the slave rebels , the role of African Americans in the Civil War, and the black-led democratic social movement of Reconstruction . They believed that this proud history justified their central role in the 1930s and 1940s in wielding a \"death blow to Jim Crow\" as a means to enact and expand American democracy.\n\nA generation of white supremacist propaganda had nearly obscured the interracial democracy that existed in the South during Reconstruction. The NNC took a lot of lessons from that political-social movement, and tried to apply it in their own era that also included a depression, war, and postwar reconstruction.\n\nWhat they hoped to do in the mid-to-late 1930s was to push the New Deal as far as they could to the left, enhancing democracy and even creating it anew, as their ally Langston Hughes famously illustrated in his poem \" Let American Be America Again .\" They thought that an activist federal government could regulate capitalism and put human rights ahead of property rights to ensure that the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth amendments of the Constitution worked for all Americans.\n\nThey certainly did not achieve the revolution they had envisioned. But some pieces of the Second New Deal of the mid-1930s, like the Wagner Act, the Resettlement Administration, and other government legislation and programs, were more progressive than the first wave of New Deal legislation. I think that this was the result of groups like the National Negro Congress catalyzing civil rights activities across the country and applying pressure from the left.\n\nWhat did the NNC's work look like on the ground? Their organizing focus and tactics really varied from chapter to chapter.\n\nI focused on six different locations where the NNC and SNYC were particularly active during their existence between 1936 and 1947. My book was the first to tackle the NNC, but should not be the last. Scores of local councils emerged across the nation, fomenting creative antiracist campaigns that should be further explored.\n\nI discovered that the NNC was different than, say, the NAACP, which functioned as a top-down organization. In some cases that organization even suspended local chapters' charters when national leaders disapproved of their actions. The NNC valued creativity in grassroots organizing. Antiracist activism developed in uneven ways across the country, and NNC activists in these places were given the leeway and autonomy to move in different directions.\n\nOne of my book's chapters, for example, examines the late 1930s Southern labor movement in Richmond. I found it fascinating that the Southern Negro Youth Congress organized tobacco workers' unions there well before the CIO even dared to organize black workers in the South. It showed me that black workers were at the vanguard of the Popular Front, which had great potential to break apart Jim Crow. But, as Ira Katznelson discusses in his book, Fear Itself , the \"southern cage\" of white supremacy was formidable, hampering the democratic potential of New Deal policies.\n\nLater chapters look at other dynamics. My chapter on World War II focuses on New York City, where activists led the way in navigating the political opportunities (such as electing Ben Davis to City Council and Adam Clayton Powell to Congress), but they also operated under limitations imposed by their allies during the Second World War. In those years, unions signed \"no strike\" pledges, and Communist Party leaders said, and I'm paraphrasing here, \"Don't do anything on race until the war is over.\" But yet the NNC, led by a dynamic group of black women, fomented new forms of antiracist activism, politics, and culture that reinvigorated the NNC to come out fighting as soon as the war ended.\n\nThe last chapter of the book delves into South Carolina, which was a very interesting location in these years. Between 1945 and about 1947, a black-led left-wing network there really did believe that they could kill Jim Crow. Before the Cold War had become entrenched, these activists possessed an optimism coming out of the war that democracy could be brought to the United States. They took an internationalist perspective, which explains why the NNC was the first African-American organization to petition the newly formed United Nations for human rights violations.\n\nI thought DC was a really fascinating case. The NNC there did some labor organizing, but because the city had less of an industrial base, it did a lot of anti-police violence work as well. You note in your book that in 1939, the Baltimore Afro-American reported that after the activism and the petition drives of the NNC, not one African American had been killed by the police in DC in the past year. That's pretty remarkable. And they also connected police violence to labor repression and strike busting. So at the same time they were fighting police violence against African Americans, they were also tying it to their efforts to craft a multiracial, labor-based coalition.\n\nThey connected the ideas of economic security and bodily autonomy, especially in DC, where black neighborhoods were carefully policed and segregated. They related these issues of racial violence to economic insecurity. They fostered a large coalition that connected police brutality to lynching, a strategy that challenged and ultimately angered Walter White of the NAACP.\n\nWhite conceived of the anti-lynching campaign more narrowly, negotiating with the Roosevelt administration and limiting the fight to a potential anti-lynching bill in Congress that ultimately failed. The NNC attacked anti-lynching as part of a wider frame, encompassing police brutality, debt peonage, and economic insecurity. John P. Davis referred to this as the \"lynch spirit\" because these forms of brutality intertwined to keep African Americans economically and socially impoverished.\n\nCan you talk about the NNC's split in 1940?\n\nAt the NNC's 1940 convention in Washington, John L. Lewis, then the head of the CIO, spoke in opposition to entering the war. Lewis was not a Communist, but he did not want another war fought by working-class men for what he determined was the benefit of corporations. John P. Davis, who had been the executive secretary and architect of the NNC since its inception, backed Lewis's demands, but more from a Communist-influenced perspective.\n\nTo put this moment in context, in 1939 the Soviet Union signed a Non-Aggression Pact with Germany. Almost overnight, Communists and some of their leftist allies begin to preach that getting involved in another world war would sacrifice working-class people for imperialist aims. Then protest politics changed dramatically in the other direction when Germany invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, making for what I call \"ideological whiplash.\" After the second shift back to the Popular Front, Davis resigned as the head of the NNC.\n\nFor black leftists during this 1939-1941 period, charting a path forward and retaining these larger coalitions was complicated and confusing. While NNC president A. Philip Randolph had previously attacked others for red-baiting the NNC, by the 1940 conference he had become convinced that the organization had become too influenced by its principal allies - the CIO (and Lewis) but especially the Communist Party. As head of the AFL-affiliated Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, Randolph did not have a strong CIO allegiance. He was a Socialist Party stalwart going back to the First World War in New York, where he had a long history of sectarian fighting with Communists. The 1939 shift away from antifascism and the Popular Front convinced him to sever ties with them. As a result, Randolph resigned as president, and many socialists and liberals went with him. The NNC split apart in 1940.\n\nBut I argue that the split was not totally debilitating to either group. Randolph and his allies went on to lead the March on Washington Movement , whose chief achievement was to threaten a march of 100,000 black people on Washington. FDR blinked and issued Executive Order 8802, which led to the Fair Employment Practice Committee and opened up some wartime jobs to African Americans. Meanwhile, the NNC started working on its own campaign that paralleled Randolph's demand for war-industries jobs. They protested discrimination in large aircraft manufacturing plants in Baltimore and Los Angeles and opened up these and other war-industries jobs through campaigns of their own.\n\nIn short, the NNC and Randolph continued with vigor after 1940, but the tragedy of this split was that neither group was able to build the kind of mass movement that they had once dreamed of in the late 1930s.\n\nCan you talk about the demise of the NNC? It's really a story about the advent of the Cold War.\n\nThe Cold War was not inevitable in the form it took. It was only by 1947 when its network got pushed on the defensive and allies abandoned them that they started falling apart as an organization.\n\nThe government listed the NNC and SNYC as \"Communist Front\" organizations and proceeded to harass, deport, and even jail its members. And the group's main allies - the Communists and the CIO - reacted in ways that further compromised them. The CIO decided to go along with the anticommunism in the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act . Its leader, Phil Murray, issued a directive that forbid unions to work with the NNC, among other groups. As a result, NNC members became cut off from the very industrial union movement they had helped build just ten years earlier.\n\nAnd then the Communist Party, rather than trying to retain a Popular Front coalition-type politics, decided to go in a more sectarian direction and sent key black leaders underground. In my view, this strategy was self-defeating, because small \"c\" communists, fellow travelers, and mid-level black CP members got exposed and traumatized by the House Un-American Activities Committee as well as other local anticommunist groups.\n\nThelma Dale Perkins, an NNC leader whom I interviewed for the book, said that one day in 1947 she realized that the organization could not survive. She personally carted all the NNC records over to the Schomburg library in Harlem because she knew that would be the only place where they would be protected rather than used as evidence by McCarthyites or destroyed by the very activists who worked with the NNC out of fear of persecution.\n\nOverall, what were the successes and failures of the NNC? And what lessons does the organization have for current struggles against racism and exploitation?\n\nThe key to the NNC is to understand that these people believed that they would destroy Jim Crow in their own generation. That's important, because historians have often treated the thirties and forties as the \"prelude to the Civil Rights Movement.\" But these radicals were not saying among themselves, \"You know, we're going to build the seedbed for the next generation to come along and get the job done.\"\n\nThey did not accomplish the goal of destroying Jim Crow, and there are many reasons why, but to conclude that they failed elides what they accomplished in their own time. In many ways, they undermined the ideological underpinnings of Jim Crow in the North and the West and to some degree in the South. They fostered a new militant black culture and experimented with forms of street-based mass protest politics. They also helped propel a generation of black union workers into stable blue-collar jobs. And their conception of \"civil rights,\" a term just emerging in their era, as based on economic security and human rights, left behind an important model, especially since the 1950s-1960s movement at first submerged these concepts as priorities.\n\nAnd despite Cold War red-baiting, connections remained between this 1930s-1940s generation and the generation of civil rights activists that followed. As one anecdotal example, the SNYC in Alabama included Sallye Davis, whose young daughter, Angela Davis, grew up in this context. These connections are not just coincidences.\n\nThe NNC was also an interesting group because of its attempts to try to organize an organization of organizations. It sought to build broad, black-led antiracist coalitions, and in building them, to push them to become more militant. Its story is instructive in our own era of tremendous economic and racial inequality. Groups have emerged to combat these issues, but they may need to work in broader coalitions to achieve their goals.\n\nOverall, I think the New Deal and Second World War era was a really creative period for protest politics both culturally and politically. I think activists today should learn from its victories as well as the mistakes that limited its impact. Just as people in the NNC saw Reconstruction as a key period, today we might look back to the protest politics of the late 1930s and '40s, which speak urgently to our contemporary problems. Police brutality, economic inequality, and fascist ideas and policies were endemic in 1939, and they're endemic in 2019.\n\nErik Gellman is an associate professor of history at the University of North Carolina and the author of Death Blow to Jim Crow: The National Negro Congress and the Rise of Militant Civil Rights .\n\nShawn Gude is Jacobin 's associate editor.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

We can't afford to let that radical history be sanitized.\n\nAfrican Americans boarding an integrated bus, following the Supreme Court ruling ending the Montgomery bus boycott in 1956.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe Montgomery bus boycott of 1955-56 opened a new phase in the centuries-long struggle for black freedom and inspired a rebirth of activism and militancy in the United States. Pioneering mass direct action against segregated public accommodations, Montgomery was the forerunner of movement struggles of the early 1960s.\n\nThe bus boycott was won by the largest black mobilization since the March on Washington of 1941. Montgomery's entire black community was organized through the churches, which were packed by protest meetings of thousands every night, and through the construction of alternative transportation - a highly effective carpool system that shuttled over 20,000 black workers to and from their jobs every day for a year. It was a brilliant portrait of the latent genius, determination, and self-organizing capacity unleashed when the working class goes into motion.\n\nThe bus boycott created new systems of struggle, strategies, tactics, organizations, leaders, and cadres.  The bravery and audacity of ordinary working people was symbolized by Rosa Parks, a seamstress who touched off the boycott by fighting for her rights with unyielding dignity and courage. The mass character and militancy of the black liberation movement made it the model, the dynamic motor force, that influenced all the subsequent movements of the 1960s.\n\nMontgomery was a renaissance, the rebirth of hope overcoming years of desperate quiet, struggle replacing acceptance, and the sense of power that we could change miserable, abusive conditions.  Its occurrence at the time of the Hungarian Revolution ; the failed imperialist invasion of Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel; and national independence for Ghana located Montgomery for the Left as part of the world-revolutionary drive for liberation.  We were still in the reactionary 1950s, but the road was being charted for a new beginning, a new radicalism.\n\nFor revolutionary socialists at the time like me, our political assumptions and horizons changed overnight. We threw ourselves into civil rights activity nonstop, remaining immersed for years in every stage of the movement until its ultimate fading. Despite our small size, we were a significant participant.\n\nMovement histories often ignore socialist involvement, a legacy from the 1950s that typically airbrushes away, minimizes, or derides socialist influence as some embarrassing or subversive secret. During McCarthyism, our role was of necessity frequently forced into the shadows. Truth, historical accuracy, political lessons, stronger bonds in the future, and trust would be better served if the contributions revolutionary socialists made to the struggle for black liberation were not ignored.\n\nGreater than the contributions we made to the movement was the impact the movement had on us. The International Socialists (IS), the group I was a member of at the time, were as much a product of the black liberation movement as we were of Trotskyism. Through Trotskyism, we saw our ideas and practices as a continuity of the Russian Revolution and the revolutionary communist tradition. But it was black liberation that defined for us what it meant to be an American revolutionary.\n\nThe impact of black self-emancipation changed us personally and politically to be modern-day abolitionists, a link in the chain of the oldest, most heroic, most noble American struggle against oppression - against slavery, white supremacy, Jim Crow, segregation, and the still-intact systemic, institutional racism of US capitalism. Combating this oppression made us unwilling to tolerate discrimination of any kind and toughened us as fighters against all oppressions.\n\nWe were shaped anew as participants in the movement's demonstrations, sit-ins, Freedom Rides, arrests, jail time, debates, militancy, creative radicalism, and self-organization, and by the inspiring guts of its black and white freedom fighters. We were not there just for the big moments, the stirring high points - we were day-to-day combatants, doing the nitty-gritty work to make events happen. Our commitment to black liberation was central to how we thought of ourselves, to our reason for being; our interests were never separate from the movement's emancipatory goals. Because of this passion, our tendency enjoyed an acceptance by movement activists that most other socialist groups could never achieve.\n\nMontgomery challenged us to make essential changes. In the grim years of McCarthyite reaction and Cold War liberalism, our influence and numbers were drastically reduced. We became isolated from the working class, ideologically marginalized, at best barely hanging on. We had to rise to this moment, to embrace the movement making history, and to prove, when appropriate, the relevance of socialist politics to the experiences the new movement was going through in real time.\n\nIt required a complete makeover, from discussion group to combat organization, from isolation to engagement, from theory to practice, from propaganda to agitation: It was a leap into the future. It involved massive reeducation, learning from and with the movement - through its practices, experiences, narratives, internal life, changing moods, and ideas.\n\nWe navigated this transition more easily because of our conviction that Montgomery was the start of an even greater upheaval. The audacity, improvisation, unity, and staying power of the 381-day bus boycott convinced us that it was the opening of a potentially explosive dynamic that could mobilize the black working class and tenant farmers across the South to crack the Jim Crow segregation system, break the hold of the white supremacist Dixiecrats on US politics, and take up the task to complete the \"unfinished revolution\" of Reconstruction.\n\nIt was a perspective that would increasingly be shared by many movement activists. Victory in Montgomery gave millions the hope and belief that change was possible, even if it would take time to flourish.\n\nAside from the Communist Party's (CP) Labor Youth League, which dissolved in 1956, the Young Socialist League (YSL, the youth section of the Independent Socialist League) was the only socialist youth group at a national level, but with a membership of at most 125 people. Yet the YSL had roots and strengths as a serious cadre organization, with an intense internal political life and a profound appreciation for theoretical training. For years, it had been suffocating, isolated from any living movement - it was dying for fresh air. YSL members were sophisticated, dedicated, tenacious; this small group produced an extraordinarily large talent pool of leading figures across the entire 1960s left spectrum.\n\nYSL members had some experience from participating in those few struggles for civil rights that existed during McCarthyism - mostly sporadic picketing, confined to the North, by the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) of restaurants and public places that refused to serve black people. The YSL was active in the important left wing of the Chicago National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), fighting to break the control of the William Dawson machine, the black subset of the Richard J. Daley machine, the Democratic Party's vehicle for keeping Chicago segregation intact. YSL publications ( Challenge and Anvil ) showed an appreciation of black culture - literature, jazz, history, and the visual arts - notoriously absent outside the black community in that reactionary period.\n\nThe YSL's mission statement, What is the Young Socialist League? , highlighted the primacy the organization accorded to the fight for black equality:\n\nThe rising tide of militant struggle by the Negro people to realize their emancipation . . . is the most important development in our political and social life. This is a battle against all that is rotten and backward in the South and the nation as a whole; it is a struggle for democracy. . . . We will do all in our power to support the struggle. . . . It is the duty of the government to enforce the ruling against segregation in the schools and to make all acts of segregation and discrimination illegal.\n\nThis was our guide.\n\nIn addition to activity, we brought to the movement theoretical views that were the distillation of the ideas of American socialism. Many originated in the Communist Party of the 1920s, which attempted to overcome the racial backwardness and mixed record of the US left epitomized by the pre-World War I Socialist Party (SP). The SP had many outstanding anti-racist fighters, from Eugene Debs, W.E.B. Du Bois, and Big Bill Haywood on down, but at its worst it tolerated segregated branches in parts of the South. Even anti-racist SPers were frequently limited by American theoretical primitiveness. They often understood black oppression as a solely economic question, another facet of capitalist exploitation, which would be solved almost automatically by socialism. Meanwhile, in the here and now, they underestimated the importance of immediate or separate struggles against racism.\n\nSome SPers spurned anti-racist struggles as reformist, others because it could create barriers with prejudiced white workers. Working-class unity would be achieved, they thought, by appealing to the lowest common denominator - economic demands that both white and black workers could agree on - while avoiding demands against racism, which might be a threat to unity. Pre-WWI socialism, with important exceptions, preferred to ignore the problem - in effect, not challenging the racist status quo, white prejudice, and the hold that bourgeois ideology, with its inherent racism, had on white workers and radicals. This political and theoretical crudeness and backwardness was often dressed up as color blindness or class unity, ignoring rather than defining and fighting American racism.\n\nIn contrast, the revolutionary tradition, under the influence of the world communist movement of the 1920s, stressed that racial oppression was central to American capitalism. The fight for socialism was inseparable from black liberation, a part of the struggle against capitalism and imperialism. The fight to overcome racism was the task of the entire working class, white as well as black workers. Revolutionaries had to win the working class to fight against all instances of oppression and exploitation. Only through the heightened class consciousness that overcame racist ideology would the working class become capable of making a socialist revolution and fit to rule society.\n\nThe CP laid the foundation for our theory that black oppression had a dual character, with blacks being a super-exploited section of the working class, as well as possessing dimensions of a national minority in some ways similar to groups afflicted by national and colonial oppression. Black liberation was a part of the struggle for national liberation; independent organizations and struggles against oppression had to be supported as a democratic demand, a matter of democracy and justice - part of the fight for socialist democracy - and as the only real way to forge working-class unity. Revolutionaries had to sympathetically understand the distinction between the nationalism of the oppressed, as a vehicle to fight against their subjugation, and the nationalism of oppressors, as a vehicle to continue coerced domination and inequality. We were not defined by standard concepts of nationalism, separatism, or integration; our goal was black equality and liberation, whatever was required to advance and achieve it - or as Malcolm X later famously said, \"by any means necessary.\"\n\nWe rejected interracial unity that ignored or subordinated black demands to white prejudice or politics. Only by rising to anti-racism could class consciousness based on class unity become a living reality; without it, no significant US revolutionary movement could be forged. Revolutionaries had to act as a vanguard, fighting all instances of prejudice, initiating struggles against racism, educating and winning the broader labor and radical movements to interracial support for these fights - even when these were highly unpopular minority views.\n\nThe 1920s CP was composed almost entirely of immigrant workers, of whom only 10 percent were in English-speaking branches. Yet these immigrant proletarian revolutionaries, under the guidance of the pre-Stalinist Communist International, developed a sophisticated theoretical approach to black liberation that armed them to fight for black equality; to break the color bar and open the trade unions to black workers; and to champion armed self-defense against the murderous pogroms against blacks in East St. Louis, Chicago, Tulsa and other cities. They were the inspiration for us who followed their revolutionary innovations.\n\nThe theoretical approach pioneered by the CP of the 1920s prior to its Stalinization was transmitted to the Trotskyist movement of the 1930s. We were instructed, in Leon Trotsky's words, \"to view the world through the eyes of the oppressed.\" During the upsurge of industrial unions in the 1930s and 1940s, the labor movement, under communist and socialist influence in its finest moments, fought racism on and off the job - convincing many black workers that the labor movement was an essential vehicle to achieve equality.\n\nThe Trotskyist movement of the 1930s and 1940s had two outstanding black leaders: C.L.R. James, the West Indian revolutionary, and Ernest Rice McKinney, labor secretary and later national secretary of the Workers Party (WP). In the 1940 split of the Trotskyist movement over World War II, James and McKinney were among the founding leaders of the new Workers Party. C. L. R. James, author of The Black Jacobins , the history of the slave rebellion that was the Haitian Revolution, is world-famous as a major Marxist theoretician, an important influence on revolutionaries internationally - including on Martin Luther King Jr, who on his first trip to Europe set up a meeting with James.\n\nJames was the leader of the WP minority, the Johnson-Forest-Stone (party names for James, Raya Dunayevskaya, and Grace Lee Boggs) tendency. This minority tendency agreed with the major programmatic views of the WP on WWII and domestic and international politics, but their analysis was that the Soviet Union was state-capitalist rather than a new form of class society. Additional differences later developed.\n\nErnest Rice McKinney needs greater introduction: He is one of many black revolutionary figures left out of history. McKinney was born in 1886, not long after Emancipation, to a family of ex-slaves. As a youngster, he was educated in union politics by his grandfather, an ex-slave, who became a leader in the bloody mine workers' class warfare in turn-of-the-century West Virginia. McKinney was a cofounder of the Niagara Movement , an early twentieth-century civil rights organization; joined the CP at its launch; was on the organizing committee of the great 1919 steel strike; and was again on the Steel Workers Organizing Committee in the 1930s Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) drive.\n\nIn the 1920s, he was labor editor of the Pittsburgh Courier and secretary of the Pittsburgh NAACP. He drifted out of the CP in the late '20s and became associated with A. J. Muste's Conference for Progressive Labor Action, which during the Depression organized the Unemployed Leagues with McKinney as editor of its newspaper. The Muste organization led the Toledo general strike of 1934 and then merged with the Trotskyists, with McKinney a few years later becoming organizer of the New York City branch of the Socialist Workers Party. McKinney was the architect of the WP's historic rank-and-file caucus strategy against the no-strike pledge during WWII, which provided leadership and program in the wartime strikes and labor actions opposed by the pro-war union officials, social democrats, and Communists.\n\nIn the South, McKinney, disguised as a preacher on a mule, successfully organized sharecroppers' strikes and WP sharecropper branches. McKinney also organized underground black workers' groups in industry to break Jim Crow job classifications, particularly in the new CIO unions. He moved rightward in the 1950s but came out of retirement to give classes for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in the 1960s.\n\nInside the Workers Party, the emphasis was placed on activity within black working-class communities and on building a multiracial revolutionary organization. A years-long discussion and debate took place internally and in the pages of Labor Action and the New International on the question of black liberation: James, particularly after the 1943 Harlem rebellion , stressed the revolutionary potential of the black community and the importance of independent black struggles and organization, summed up later in his famous document The Revolutionary Answer to the Negro Problem in the United States.\n\nMcKinney, meanwhile, stressed that black liberation could only be successful through the working-class and union movement. The arguments of these two positions bred a lively theoretical and political culture, with a deep appreciation for black history. These were the foundations out of which our outlook developed. We were originally trained in McKinney's position, but under the impact of 1960s black liberation, the IS reassessment of this question brought us into greater agreement with James' views.\n\nIn the civil rights movement, we were movement loyalists. We shared its goals. We believed that socialists should join, defend, strengthen, assist, and champion this movement. We also were dedicated to building its militant left wing as a necessity for victory, as well as for renewing socialist organization. While involved in countless struggles to desegregate public accommodations, we emphasized that it was essential to fight for voting rights and jobs, to attack the underpinnings of racist institutions. These ideas became vital in the 1960s, in Southern voting struggles; in the March on Washington, whose main slogan was \"For Jobs and Freedom\"; and in the Bay Area movement, which under left influence made its major goal the fight to open racist job markets.\n\nWe believed all liberation struggles of the oppressed were indispensable parts of the class struggle against capitalism. We were not dismayed by the fact that in the early stages of the movement, the fighters were often Christians who were nonviolent, who had illusions in liberalism and in the government, and who did not start with an anti-capitalist consciousness. Some radical groups were dismissive of this stage of the movement, awaiting a \"higher stage\" before taking part in the struggle; to their shame and embarrassment, they missed the civil rights movement. We recognized that existing consciousness would change through struggle, as events taught people essential lessons about the real power relations of capitalist society - the role of politicians, the police, the mass media, established institutions and authorities - and radicalized them as they became more self-confident, convinced of their own agency, power, and ability to transform society, particularly if socialists were present to give voice to these radical political lessons. Our guide was Karl Marx's famous formulation in the Communist Manifesto: We have no interests apart from the masses of workers and the oppressed, and in the movement of the present we fight for the movement's future.\n\nWe were often subject to red-baiting from political opponents - liberals as well as conservatives - who appealed to the still lingering McCarthyite sensibilities of American \"common sense\" that reds are an alien element with sinister purposes to impose some nefarious \"outside\" agenda. We overcame red-baiting attacks by taking them head-on politically, including in our forthright defense of the relationship of socialism to oppression.\n\nWe opposed without qualification all oppression and exploitation - its elimination was what we considered socialism to be. The movements to achieve the end of oppression and exploitation are the process and vehicles for the liberation of humanity. These views, and our practice, became understood by movement activists and gained us respect, comradely feelings, and acceptance. It became impossible to witch-hunt us out of the movement.\n\nBefore Montgomery, the NAACP was the only organization with a mass black membership. The NAACP focused on court litigation, legislative lobbying, and pressuring political and corporate elites. There were some militant, local-chapter exceptions to this reform-from-above strategy. But the national leadership opposed mass action from below, breaking the law except for court case challenges, and mass arrests as \"counterproductive\" and a threat to respectable pressure politics. Roy Wilkins, NAACP chief, dismissed protests as \"blowing off steam.\" Victory in Montgomery opened alternatives to the dominant NAACP strategy.\n\nThe NAACP's crowning achievement was the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision, the landmark court ruling against segregated schools and the doctrine of \"separate but equal.\" The Dwight D. Eisenhower administration, however, refused to enforce the decision, and there was no existing movement to make enforcement happen. But Brown set off a strong segregationist backlash - the campaign of \"Massive Resistance,\" spearheaded by Southern Democratic congressmen, with the quiet acquiescence of other Democratic officials. This racist counterattack reinforced McCarthyism, with the NAACP outlawed as subversive in some Southern states, and its members fired from public employment.\n\nSouthern business, professionals, and the middle class sponsored the formation of the \"respectable\" white supremacist Citizens' Councils. The Citizens' Councils and police departments across the South provided cover for the reinvigorated Ku Klux Klan to terrorize rural black people. This white racist reaction effectively held back the fledgling movement during three long years between Montgomery and the eruption of the sit-in movement in Greensboro, North Carolina. But it was the ferment of those years, the demonstrations and the fight back, that kept the Montgomery spirit alive - and was laying the basis for the mass upsurge of the 1960s.\n\nMontgomery's aftermath clarified that traditional national black organizations would not engage in militant, mass actions; new organizations were needed for the fight. Bayard Rustin was pivotal to this development. Rustin conceived the idea for the first new organization, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). He was the agent for creating the relationship between A. Philip Randolph and Martin Luther King Jr that became the force behind national mass actions.\n\nRandolph and Wilkins were, prior to King, the most prominent black leaders nationally. Randolph was the most successful black trade unionist in American history. He organized the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters (BSCP), the only independent black trade union, and later headed the 1930s mass National Negro Congress . Randolph's greatest success was in forming the all-black March on Washington Movement (MOWM) in 1941, which demanded racial equality in defense plants and the integration of the armed forces. It threatened demonstrations that could disrupt defense preparations on the eve of World War II.  Roosevelt, allied to the Dixiecrats, fought the MOWM and its demands - but was forced to capitulate, and issued an executive order that created the Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC).\n\nUntil the FEPC, racist employers kept most black workers confined to farm, service, menial, and household servant work. The FEPC set off a vast migration, as black workers went from poverty wages in the South to union wages and conditions in Northern war factories.\n\nRandolph's prestige came from his efforts that changed black social conditions to a greater degree than any of his contemporaries, until King, were able to achieve. Bayard Rustin became a national figure in the civil rights movement through his position as the coordinator of the Randolph-King forces. These forces began without strong national organization, and Rustin relied heavily upon the YSL and our allies as his troops for mobilizations. Our alliance with Rustin is what gave us a role disproportionate to our size.\n\nRustin was probably the most talented mass organizer that the US left has produced. His planning genius was connected to his visionary political ideas and tactics. A socialist and radical pacifist, Rustin was an openly gay man, which made him a target for harassment in the homophobic 1950s. Rustin paid the price: arrests, slanders, demotions, firings, being banned for years from civil rights prominence. He repeatedly overcame these setbacks and was restored to leadership because of his unique talents.\n\nMovement histories often overlooked, minimized, or depreciated Rustin's role until gay consciousness restored acknowledgement of his importance. Neither A. J. Muste nor King would defend Rustin from attacks about his sexuality. The YSL, with liberated sexual views unusual in the conservative 1950s, defended his sexuality and sexual rights; it was another bond in our alliance.\n\nRustin's experience of mass organization stretched back to his Young Communist League membership, when he helped organize a successful bus boycott against job discrimination in New York City. He left the CP in opposition to its support for US entry into World War II and became an assistant to Randolph in the MOWM. From the mid-1950s on, he was Randolph's closest political collaborator.\n\nPrior to Montgomery, Rustin was the executive secretary of the War Resisters League, and the primary organizer of the radical pacifist current led by Muste, which dominated a number of interlocking organizations including the WRL, the Fellowship of Reconciliation, CORE, and Liberation magazine. The Muste group shared some defining politics with us, to which they gave a pacifist content. Liberation 's inaugural issue in April 1956 raised as its own the slogan, \"Neither Washington nor Moscow, but for the Third Camp,\" and editorially defined Russian Stalinism as \"bureaucratic collectivism.\" That same issue of Liberation included \"Our Struggle,\" King's first article on Montgomery, written in the midst of the conflict, explaining its central lessons as the rise of\n\nThe New Negro . . . a revolutionary change in the Negro's evaluation of himself and his destiny . . . the church is becoming militant . . . economics is part of our struggle . . . and we have discovered a new and powerful weapon, non-violent resistance.\n\nThe WP, renamed the Independent Socialist League (ISL) in 1949, had fraternal ties with the radical pacifist, anti-capitalist, and anti-Stalinist Muste current. Muste was the keynote speaker at the founding conference of the YSL. The ISL and the Muste tendency formed a joint organization, the Third Camp Committee, to oppose imperialism and the Cold War. Its activities during the Cold War included demonstrations against the Francisco Franco dictatorship, the US invasion of Guatemala, and other imperialist crimes. Common activity, based on common principles, with the Muste group furthered our acceptance within the civil rights and peace movements, and was our original link to Rustin.\n\nRustin was dispatched to Montgomery by Randolph and Muste in February 1956, when it seemed the bus boycott might weaken. Coretta Scott King was a longtime admirer of Rustin's work, easing his introduction to Martin Luther King Jr. Rustin had long, deep, imaginative, even transformative discussions with King that began their decade-long creative alliance. Rustin was King's original guide in nonviolent resistance, as well as a political adviser and tactician to King, who was just beginning his political career.\n\nKing had tremendous respect and admiration for both Randolph and Muste, and Rustin was his first link to them and their world. This relationship would allow Rustin to construct the Randolph-King alliance as the mass action alternative to the existing civil rights strategy.\n\nRustin's Montgomery experience led him to formulate some key ideas. The first was that, at this historic juncture, the black church was the only independent institution capable of mass black mobilization. Rustin insisted that whatever its conservative limitations, the black church could be neither ignored nor circumvented; no successful effort to advance the struggle was possible without it.\n\nAs the Young Socialist Challenge reported, Rustin said in a May 6, 1957, speech at a YSL meeting:\n\nIn Montgomery . . . throughout the South and in the North, the Negro churches have been the rallying point of a gigantic mass movement . . . The church is the one representative institution which is universal to the Negro community.\n\nRustin drew the conclusion, and convinced King, to form the SCLC, comprising those black churches and ministers committed to direct action and mass mobilization. Rustin was King's nominee to be executive director of the SCLC, until vetoed by other ministers because of Rustin's homosexuality and radicalism.\n\nYSL members were convinced of Rustin's view that the black church was essential to organizing the civil rights movement at this opening stage. It was the key lever to set in motion the mass struggle from below, which would later take other, more militant organizational forms in SNCC, CORE, the Deacons for Defense and Justice, the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, and black power organizations.\n\nAnother strategic Rustin contribution that influenced the early movement was his theory of \"social dislocation.\" Social dislocation argues that mass civil disobedience could impose upon the racist white power structure a situation of social chaos, forcing it to respond. The disruption of US life could \"dislocate\" the racist functioning of \"normal American society\" by shifting the burden and consequences of racism onto the upholders of the status quo.\n\nThe Montgomery bus boycott was victorious when the carpool system bankrupted the bus company, strategically changing the balance of power by placing the costs of segregation onto the municipal authorities. The pain and humiliation of segregation and racism could be shifted so that not just black people suffered, which the United States tolerated, but racists were forced by inconvenience or loss to share the burdens and costs of institutionalized racism - or make changes.\n\nRustin was a profound source in making the boycott a national story. He had an intense impact on us as the boycott was happening. Shortly after he returned from Montgomery, in April 1956 there was an all-day Philadelphia Third Camp Conference, sponsored by the ISL, the YSL, and the WRL. The speakers were Rustin, Muste, and Michael Harrington , national chairman of the YSL.\n\nIn his speech, \"The Meaning of Montgomery,\" Rustin interpreted the bus boycott as a triad of significance: a watershed event in black history, a labor upsurge in the South, and a part of the revolt against colonial domination. The United States, Rustin held, had brought its colonial subjects from Africa home, and this revolt was similar to the ongoing international struggles for national liberation. The concept that black people represented an internal colony inside the United States had previously been advanced by the CP and was popularized a decade later by the Black Panther Party.\n\nRustin ended his remarks by saying that third-camp socialists had a duty to take part in this movement for racial equality and anti-colonialism. He continued this message with a speaking tour of college campuses that included YSL forums.\n\nIt was in building Northern solidarity for Montgomery that our active collaboration with Rustin was cemented. Rustin cofounded a new, small organization, In Friendship, with civil rights veterans Ella Baker, later godmother of SNCC, and Stanley Levison, later King's fundraising and political adviser. In Friendship's purpose was to provide \"economic assistance to those suffering economic reprisals in the efforts to secure civil rights.\" In Friendship's first major event was a Madison Square Garden 20,000-strong rally, the largest such event since the March on Washington Movement. It was held a month after the Philadelphia conference, and for the first time, considerable on-the-ground organizing was provided by YSL and ISL members, who showed their competency, professionalism, and nonsectarianism.\n\nIt was a role that might have been precluded in previous years by the Communist Party's hegemony on the Left. A second fundraiser was held in December 1956, featuring Duke Ellington, Harry Belafonte, and Coretta Scott King. These events were the start of the ongoing working relationship between Rustin and the YSL, two of whose members - Tom Kahn and Rachelle Horowitz - became his main assistants.\n\nThe partnership with Rustin was our entry into collaboration with Randolph and King. The only downside of this relationship developed years later, when Rustin became the main spokesman in the civil rights movement for the rightward-moving Max Shachtman group.\n\nThree mass demonstrations took place in Washington, DC, in the years between Montgomery and the 1960 sit-in movement. They were the first large-scale protests at the nation's capital since the 1940s. Each demonstration showed the determination to sustain the fight for civil rights in the face of the Southern racist backlash and federal government stonewalling. During the years when there was no ongoing national mass movement, these marches were stepping-stones to the 1960s and dress rehearsals for the March on Washington of 1963. The organizing center for the marches was on 125th Street in Harlem, at the BSCP or other union offices.\n\nRandolph and King were the cochairmen who coopted other luminaries as cosponsors. Rustin was organizer, Kahn and Horowitz his chief assistants. The YSL and its allies were the cadres responsible for the \" Jimmie Higgins \" work of building the marches, publicizing them, getting the endorsements, confirming speakers, and mobilizing people through carpools and buses.\n\nThe first march, the Prayer Pilgrimage, was named after a one-day demonstration in Montgomery in which, to show their resolve, people walked to work as opposed to using the carpools. The following two events were the Youth Marches for Integrated Schools. The political backdrop to all three marches was that, despite the Brown v . Board of Education decision of 1954, the federal government had done nothing to implement school desegregation in the South.\n\nIn the Brown v. Board of Education case, the board of education was that of Topeka, Kansas. Schools were segregated in a number of Northern and Border states, including Delaware, Maryland, Missouri, and Kentucky, as well as southern areas of Illinois, Indiana, and Kansas. Schools in those regions were integrated between 1954 and the early 1960s, but in the Deep South, 99 percent of schools remained segregated in 1963. The courts and the federal government were not enforcing the law; for Brown to become reality, movement pressure was necessary.\n\nAction to force the government to implement the supposedly established \"law of the land\" was the core function of the marches. The Prayer Pilgrimage was held on the third anniversary of the Brown decision, in May 1957. Labor Action reported on a YSL meeting where Rustin insisted that the Pilgrimage was\n\nnot going to pray and wait for the heavens to open up. . . . It will confront a congress which is do-nothing in the area of civil rights. . . .  The issue is not confined to civil rights. . . . Every political question in America today . . . schools, health, labor - is becoming inextricably tied up with the issue of emancipation posed by the developments in the South.\n\nThe Prayer Pilgrimage, which more than 25,000 attended, was the first mass protest in years, the largest civil rights demonstration until that time. Its overwhelming religious character was fortunately interspersed with overtones of militancy. It was the first demonstration sponsored by the SCLC and gave the organization a sense of the broad support it could build nationally.\n\nAt the pilgrimage, King gave his first major speech in the North, placing him on the national stage; in the black media, for the first time, King was heralded as the nation's most important black leader. King's theme was an electrifying call to \"give us the ballot,\" a demand for the federal government to protect black voter registration; if blacks could vote in the South, King maintained, desegregation, including of the schools, would follow.\n\nKing's speech foreshadowed the Southern voter registration drives of the 1960s. King's speech castigated both political parties for betraying justice:\n\nThe Democrats have betrayed it by capitulating to the prejudices and undemocratic practices of the Southern Dixiecrats. The Republicans have betrayed it by capitulating to the blatant hypocrisy of right-wing, reactionary northerners. These men so often have a high blood pressure of words and an anemia of deeds.\n\nLabor Action celebrated the spirit of resistance the pilgrimage represented, but slammed the absence of leading union officials and liberals:\n\nMany moods and many tendencies came together in Washington. . . . But if one element stands out above all others it is this: the Negro movement expresses its determination to press forward for democracy - against the old parties, if need be; in the face of the labor officialdom, if need be; without the public support of hypocritical liberals, if need be.\n\nKing's speech at the Prayer Pilgrimage signaled the new movement's defiant refusal to allow the white liberal establishment to set the pace of change. Against calls to revert to passivity, King argued that \"Southern Negroes . . . will not and cannot retreat.\"\n\nThe first Youth March for Integrated Schools occurred the next year, in October 1958, focused on trying to force the federal government to intervene in Little Rock, Arkansas, against governor Orval Faubus, who violently obstructed school integration, eventually closing the high schools for a year. Some 12,000 students demonstrated for integration, in what was seen as the start of the student civil rights movement.\n\nRustin toured college campuses in New York City with Jackie Robinson to build the march, and King spoke at NYC churches. As historian Daniel Levine writes, \"The whole thing was a shoestring operation. . . . Most of the support came from labor unions, primarily those unions in which black workers were an important part of the membership.\"\n\nThe march was organized along lines that Michael Harrington outlined in his instructions to Young People's Socialist League (YPSL) branches, into which the YSL had just merged. Rustin would speak only on campuses with YPSL branches, who were the force organizing for the march. Two meetings would occur. First, a large public meeting would mobilize for the demonstration, for which the YPSL was to seek broad sponsorships from the NAACP Youth Council, the student government, and campus progressive groups. The second meeting would be a YPSL internal membership meeting, in which Rustin would speak on the role of socialists in the civil rights movement, and on the strategy and tactics socialists should employ in building the movement's next steps. King was the featured speaker at the Youth March, but after he was stabbed and hospitalized, Coretta Scott King filled in as primary speaker.\n\nA second Youth March followed six months later, in April 1959, attended by 25,000 people and accompanied by petitions signed by hundreds of thousands of students demanding federal support for school integration. \"More than three hundred buses, half of them from outside New York,\" historian Maurice Isserman writes, arrived in DC. King, Harry Belafonte, Jackie Robinson, and Tom Mboya, chairman of the All-African People's Conference, all spoke.\n\nThe structure of the demonstration was similar to the first. Randolph and King called the march and received cosponsorship from the NAACP, while Rustin organized it, with the YPSL the major organizing force on the ground across the country. As Isserman writes, \"New recruits helped out at the Youth March headquarters in Harlem and elsewhere around the country; these recruits included Bob Moses, then a New York City high school teacher, and Eleanor Holmes . . . then a student at Antioch College.\"\n\nIn Chicago, the YPSL was able to use its influence within the NAACP, the United Auto Workers, and the United Packinghouse Workers of America to mobilize buses for the April 18 march. King linked the campaign to a broader effort to \"advance democracy in the South.\"\n\nThe three marches demonstrated the potential national scope of the movement, but the demand for federal intervention in the South was ignored by President Eisenhower, met with silence by the liberal establishment, and not covered by most of the white press. As an editorial in Labor Action succinctly declared, \"White liberals talk, Southern reaction acts.\"\n\nBut a new generation of young black people felt that they could not wait for court rulings or for the federal government to confront the apartheid system. Labor Action captured the mood of frustration and anger simmering among segregation's opponents at the inaction of the establishment:\n\nThe responsibility for the fact that there has been no break in the defiance of the Supreme Court's integration order in the Deep South rests to no small degree on the shoulders on the national leadership of both political parties. Their shameless capitulation to the Southern racists has actually encouraged the latter's defiance of the court order.\n\nBrown v. Board of Education appeared to mean little more than the paper it was written on.\n\nThe years between 1956 and 1960 were a period of racist backlash and also of ideological ferment preparing the next great wave of struggle. Revolutionary socialists' experience in building solidarity with Montgomery, organizing the three Washington marches, and forging close alliances with key movement leaders solidified us as a part of the activist core preparing movement revival. Some activists of the '60s began their political life as organizers for the marches - among them, Bob Moses of SNCC and the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, and Ezell Blair, one of the four students who began the Greensboro lunch counter sit-in.\n\nIn these years of ferment, a civil rights subculture was created, developing a new generation of fighters who emerged, to the surprise of the world, seemingly overnight in the 1960 sit-ins and solidarity picketing. The YSL/YPSL was a visible part of this subculture that fused activism with education, in a renewal of the tradition of abolitionism - a \"new abolitionism,\" as Howard Zinn called it .\n\nOur contribution was not only as movement fighters, but also in political education in the movement subculture. YPSL held classes and reading groups on Reconstruction, the populist movement, Scottsboro, the CIO upsurge. We read Du Bois, C.L.R. James, C. Vann Woodward, Langston Hughes, Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, and James Baldwin, a one-time YPSL member who would occasionally speak for us. These classes and discussions were part of the intellectual culture in which activists for the 1960s civil rights movement were being formed. To be taken seriously in movement discussions, people needed to know the Harlem Renaissance, Scottsboro, Reconstruction, populism.\n\nA dynamic political culture, of which we were an essential part, developed in the late 1950s, as the gathering momentum for social justice broke conformity and prefigured the 1960s. We established a strong position in the formative years of the movement; the test would be how we used these positions in the mass upsurge of the 1960s.\n\nJoel Geier has been a revolutionary Marxist activist for over six decades.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe Montgomery bus boycott of 1955-56 opened a new phase in the centuries-long struggle for black freedom and inspired a rebirth of activism and militancy in the United States. Pioneering mass direct action against segregated public accommodations, Montgomery was the forerunner of movement struggles of the early 1960s.\n\nThe bus boycott was won by the largest black mobilization since the March on Washington of 1941. Montgomery's entire black community was organized through the churches, which were packed by protest meetings of thousands every night, and through the construction of alternative transportation - a highly effective carpool system that shuttled over 20,000 black workers to and from their jobs every day for a year. It was a brilliant portrait of the latent genius, determination, and self-organizing capacity unleashed when the working class goes into motion.\n\nThe bus boycott created new systems of struggle, strategies, tactics, organizations, leaders, and cadres.  The bravery and audacity of ordinary working people was symbolized by Rosa Parks, a seamstress who touched off the boycott by fighting for her rights with unyielding dignity and courage. The mass character and militancy of the black liberation movement made it the model, the dynamic motor force, that influenced all the subsequent movements of the 1960s.\n\nMontgomery was a renaissance, the rebirth of hope overcoming years of desperate quiet, struggle replacing acceptance, and the sense of power that we could change miserable, abusive conditions.  Its occurrence at the time of the Hungarian Revolution ; the failed imperialist invasion of Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel; and national independence for Ghana located Montgomery for the Left as part of the world-revolutionary drive for liberation.  We were still in the reactionary 1950s, but the road was being charted for a new beginning, a new radicalism.\n\nFor revolutionary socialists at the time like me, our political assumptions and horizons changed overnight. We threw ourselves into civil rights activity nonstop, remaining immersed for years in every stage of the movement until its ultimate fading. Despite our small size, we were a significant participant.\n\nMovement histories often ignore socialist involvement, a legacy from the 1950s that typically airbrushes away, minimizes, or derides socialist influence as some embarrassing or subversive secret. During McCarthyism, our role was of necessity frequently forced into the shadows. Truth, historical accuracy, political lessons, stronger bonds in the future, and trust would be better served if the contributions revolutionary socialists made to the struggle for black liberation were not ignored.\n\nGreater than the contributions we made to the movement was the impact the movement had on us. The International Socialists (IS), the group I was a member of at the time, were as much a product of the black liberation movement as we were of Trotskyism. Through Trotskyism, we saw our ideas and practices as a continuity of the Russian Revolution and the revolutionary communist tradition. But it was black liberation that defined for us what it meant to be an American revolutionary.\n\nThe impact of black self-emancipation changed us personally and politically to be modern-day abolitionists, a link in the chain of the oldest, most heroic, most noble American struggle against oppression - against slavery, white supremacy, Jim Crow, segregation, and the still-intact systemic, institutional racism of US capitalism. Combating this oppression made us unwilling to tolerate discrimination of any kind and toughened us as fighters against all oppressions.\n\nWe were shaped anew as participants in the movement's demonstrations, sit-ins, Freedom Rides, arrests, jail time, debates, militancy, creative radicalism, and self-organization, and by the inspiring guts of its black and white freedom fighters. We were not there just for the big moments, the stirring high points - we were day-to-day combatants, doing the nitty-gritty work to make events happen. Our commitment to black liberation was central to how we thought of ourselves, to our reason for being; our interests were never separate from the movement's emancipatory goals. Because of this passion, our tendency enjoyed an acceptance by movement activists that most other socialist groups could never achieve.\n\nMontgomery challenged us to make essential changes. In the grim years of McCarthyite reaction and Cold War liberalism, our influence and numbers were drastically reduced. We became isolated from the working class, ideologically marginalized, at best barely hanging on. We had to rise to this moment, to embrace the movement making history, and to prove, when appropriate, the relevance of socialist politics to the experiences the new movement was going through in real time.\n\nIt required a complete makeover, from discussion group to combat organization, from isolation to engagement, from theory to practice, from propaganda to agitation: It was a leap into the future. It involved massive reeducation, learning from and with the movement - through its practices, experiences, narratives, internal life, changing moods, and ideas.\n\nWe navigated this transition more easily because of our conviction that Montgomery was the start of an even greater upheaval. The audacity, improvisation, unity, and staying power of the 381-day bus boycott convinced us that it was the opening of a potentially explosive dynamic that could mobilize the black working class and tenant farmers across the South to crack the Jim Crow segregation system, break the hold of the white supremacist Dixiecrats on US politics, and take up the task to complete the \"unfinished revolution\" of Reconstruction.\n\nIt was a perspective that would increasingly be shared by many movement activists. Victory in Montgomery gave millions the hope and belief that change was possible, even if it would take time to flourish.\n\nAside from the Communist Party's (CP) Labor Youth League, which dissolved in 1956, the Young Socialist League (YSL, the youth section of the Independent Socialist League) was the only socialist youth group at a national level, but with a membership of at most 125 people. Yet the YSL had roots and strengths as a serious cadre organization, with an intense internal political life and a profound appreciation for theoretical training. For years, it had been suffocating, isolated from any living movement - it was dying for fresh air. YSL members were sophisticated, dedicated, tenacious; this small group produced an extraordinarily large talent pool of leading figures across the entire 1960s left spectrum.\n\nYSL members had some experience from participating in those few struggles for civil rights that existed during McCarthyism - mostly sporadic picketing, confined to the North, by the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) of restaurants and public places that refused to serve black people. The YSL was active in the important left wing of the Chicago National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), fighting to break the control of the William Dawson machine, the black subset of the Richard J. Daley machine, the Democratic Party's vehicle for keeping Chicago segregation intact. YSL publications ( Challenge and Anvil ) showed an appreciation of black culture - literature, jazz, history, and the visual arts - notoriously absent outside the black community in that reactionary period.\n\nThe YSL's mission statement, What is the Young Socialist League? , highlighted the primacy the organization accorded to the fight for black equality:\n\nThe rising tide of militant struggle by the Negro people to realize their emancipation . . . is the most important development in our political and social life. This is a battle against all that is rotten and backward in the South and the nation as a whole; it is a struggle for democracy. . . . We will do all in our power to support the struggle. . . . It is the duty of the government to enforce the ruling against segregation in the schools and to make all acts of segregation and discrimination illegal.\n\nThis was our guide.\n\nIn addition to activity, we brought to the movement theoretical views that were the distillation of the ideas of American socialism. Many originated in the Communist Party of the 1920s, which attempted to overcome the racial backwardness and mixed record of the US left epitomized by the pre-World War I Socialist Party (SP). The SP had many outstanding anti-racist fighters, from Eugene Debs, W.E.B. Du Bois, and Big Bill Haywood on down, but at its worst it tolerated segregated branches in parts of the South. Even anti-racist SPers were frequently limited by American theoretical primitiveness. They often understood black oppression as a solely economic question, another facet of capitalist exploitation, which would be solved almost automatically by socialism. Meanwhile, in the here and now, they underestimated the importance of immediate or separate struggles against racism.\n\nSome SPers spurned anti-racist struggles as reformist, others because it could create barriers with prejudiced white workers. Working-class unity would be achieved, they thought, by appealing to the lowest common denominator - economic demands that both white and black workers could agree on - while avoiding demands against racism, which might be a threat to unity. Pre-WWI socialism, with important exceptions, preferred to ignore the problem - in effect, not challenging the racist status quo, white prejudice, and the hold that bourgeois ideology, with its inherent racism, had on white workers and radicals. This political and theoretical crudeness and backwardness was often dressed up as color blindness or class unity, ignoring rather than defining and fighting American racism.\n\nIn contrast, the revolutionary tradition, under the influence of the world communist movement of the 1920s, stressed that racial oppression was central to American capitalism. The fight for socialism was inseparable from black liberation, a part of the struggle against capitalism and imperialism. The fight to overcome racism was the task of the entire working class, white as well as black workers. Revolutionaries had to win the working class to fight against all instances of oppression and exploitation. Only through the heightened class consciousness that overcame racist ideology would the working class become capable of making a socialist revolution and fit to rule society.\n\nThe CP laid the foundation for our theory that black oppression had a dual character, with blacks being a super-exploited section of the working class, as well as possessing dimensions of a national minority in some ways similar to groups afflicted by national and colonial oppression. Black liberation was a part of the struggle for national liberation; independent organizations and struggles against oppression had to be supported as a democratic demand, a matter of democracy and justice - part of the fight for socialist democracy - and as the only real way to forge working-class unity. Revolutionaries had to sympathetically understand the distinction between the nationalism of the oppressed, as a vehicle to fight against their subjugation, and the nationalism of oppressors, as a vehicle to continue coerced domination and inequality. We were not defined by standard concepts of nationalism, separatism, or integration; our goal was black equality and liberation, whatever was required to advance and achieve it - or as Malcolm X later famously said, \"by any means necessary.\"\n\nWe rejected interracial unity that ignored or subordinated black demands to white prejudice or politics. Only by rising to anti-racism could class consciousness based on class unity become a living reality; without it, no significant US revolutionary movement could be forged. Revolutionaries had to act as a vanguard, fighting all instances of prejudice, initiating struggles against racism, educating and winning the broader labor and radical movements to interracial support for these fights - even when these were highly unpopular minority views.\n\nThe 1920s CP was composed almost entirely of immigrant workers, of whom only 10 percent were in English-speaking branches. Yet these immigrant proletarian revolutionaries, under the guidance of the pre-Stalinist Communist International, developed a sophisticated theoretical approach to black liberation that armed them to fight for black equality; to break the color bar and open the trade unions to black workers; and to champion armed self-defense against the murderous pogroms against blacks in East St. Louis, Chicago, Tulsa and other cities. They were the inspiration for us who followed their revolutionary innovations.\n\nThe theoretical approach pioneered by the CP of the 1920s prior to its Stalinization was transmitted to the Trotskyist movement of the 1930s. We were instructed, in Leon Trotsky's words, \"to view the world through the eyes of the oppressed.\" During the upsurge of industrial unions in the 1930s and 1940s, the labor movement, under communist and socialist influence in its finest moments, fought racism on and off the job - convincing many black workers that the labor movement was an essential vehicle to achieve equality.\n\nThe Trotskyist movement of the 1930s and 1940s had two outstanding black leaders: C.L.R. James, the West Indian revolutionary, and Ernest Rice McKinney, labor secretary and later national secretary of the Workers Party (WP). In the 1940 split of the Trotskyist movement over World War II, James and McKinney were among the founding leaders of the new Workers Party. C. L. R. James, author of The Black Jacobins , the history of the slave rebellion that was the Haitian Revolution, is world-famous as a major Marxist theoretician, an important influence on revolutionaries internationally - including on Martin Luther King Jr, who on his first trip to Europe set up a meeting with James.\n\nJames was the leader of the WP minority, the Johnson-Forest-Stone (party names for James, Raya Dunayevskaya, and Grace Lee Boggs) tendency. This minority tendency agreed with the major programmatic views of the WP on WWII and domestic and international politics, but their analysis was that the Soviet Union was state-capitalist rather than a new form of class society. Additional differences later developed.\n\nErnest Rice McKinney needs greater introduction: He is one of many black revolutionary figures left out of history. McKinney was born in 1886, not long after Emancipation, to a family of ex-slaves. As a youngster, he was educated in union politics by his grandfather, an ex-slave, who became a leader in the bloody mine workers' class warfare in turn-of-the-century West Virginia. McKinney was a cofounder of the Niagara Movement , an early twentieth-century civil rights organization; joined the CP at its launch; was on the organizing committee of the great 1919 steel strike; and was again on the Steel Workers Organizing Committee in the 1930s Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) drive.\n\nIn the 1920s, he was labor editor of the Pittsburgh Courier and secretary of the Pittsburgh NAACP. He drifted out of the CP in the late '20s and became associated with A. J. Muste's Conference for Progressive Labor Action, which during the Depression organized the Unemployed Leagues with McKinney as editor of its newspaper. The Muste organization led the Toledo general strike of 1934 and then merged with the Trotskyists, with McKinney a few years later becoming organizer of the New York City branch of the Socialist Workers Party. McKinney was the architect of the WP's historic rank-and-file caucus strategy against the no-strike pledge during WWII, which provided leadership and program in the wartime strikes and labor actions opposed by the pro-war union officials, social democrats, and Communists.\n\nIn the South, McKinney, disguised as a preacher on a mule, successfully organized sharecroppers' strikes and WP sharecropper branches. McKinney also organized underground black workers' groups in industry to break Jim Crow job classifications, particularly in the new CIO unions. He moved rightward in the 1950s but came out of retirement to give classes for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in the 1960s.\n\nInside the Workers Party, the emphasis was placed on activity within black working-class communities and on building a multiracial revolutionary organization. A years-long discussion and debate took place internally and in the pages of Labor Action and the New International on the question of black liberation: James, particularly after the 1943 Harlem rebellion , stressed the revolutionary potential of the black community and the importance of independent black struggles and organization, summed up later in his famous document The Revolutionary Answer to the Negro Problem in the United States.\n\nMcKinney, meanwhile, stressed that black liberation could only be successful through the working-class and union movement. The arguments of these two positions bred a lively theoretical and political culture, with a deep appreciation for black history. These were the foundations out of which our outlook developed. We were originally trained in McKinney's position, but under the impact of 1960s black liberation, the IS reassessment of this question brought us into greater agreement with James' views.\n\nIn the civil rights movement, we were movement loyalists. We shared its goals. We believed that socialists should join, defend, strengthen, assist, and champion this movement. We also were dedicated to building its militant left wing as a necessity for victory, as well as for renewing socialist organization. While involved in countless struggles to desegregate public accommodations, we emphasized that it was essential to fight for voting rights and jobs, to attack the underpinnings of racist institutions. These ideas became vital in the 1960s, in Southern voting struggles; in the March on Washington, whose main slogan was \"For Jobs and Freedom\"; and in the Bay Area movement, which under left influence made its major goal the fight to open racist job markets.\n\nWe believed all liberation struggles of the oppressed were indispensable parts of the class struggle against capitalism. We were not dismayed by the fact that in the early stages of the movement, the fighters were often Christians who were nonviolent, who had illusions in liberalism and in the government, and who did not start with an anti-capitalist consciousness. Some radical groups were dismissive of this stage of the movement, awaiting a \"higher stage\" before taking part in the struggle; to their shame and embarrassment, they missed the civil rights movement. We recognized that existing consciousness would change through struggle, as events taught people essential lessons about the real power relations of capitalist society - the role of politicians, the police, the mass media, established institutions and authorities - and radicalized them as they became more self-confident, convinced of their own agency, power, and ability to transform society, particularly if socialists were present to give voice to these radical political lessons. Our guide was Karl Marx's famous formulation in the Communist Manifesto: We have no interests apart from the masses of workers and the oppressed, and in the movement of the present we fight for the movement's future.\n\nWe were often subject to red-baiting from political opponents - liberals as well as conservatives - who appealed to the still lingering McCarthyite sensibilities of American \"common sense\" that reds are an alien element with sinister purposes to impose some nefarious \"outside\" agenda. We overcame red-baiting attacks by taking them head-on politically, including in our forthright defense of the relationship of socialism to oppression.\n\nWe opposed without qualification all oppression and exploitation - its elimination was what we considered socialism to be. The movements to achieve the end of oppression and exploitation are the process and vehicles for the liberation of humanity. These views, and our practice, became understood by movement activists and gained us respect, comradely feelings, and acceptance. It became impossible to witch-hunt us out of the movement.\n\nBefore Montgomery, the NAACP was the only organization with a mass black membership. The NAACP focused on court litigation, legislative lobbying, and pressuring political and corporate elites. There were some militant, local-chapter exceptions to this reform-from-above strategy. But the national leadership opposed mass action from below, breaking the law except for court case challenges, and mass arrests as \"counterproductive\" and a threat to respectable pressure politics. Roy Wilkins, NAACP chief, dismissed protests as \"blowing off steam.\" Victory in Montgomery opened alternatives to the dominant NAACP strategy.\n\nThe NAACP's crowning achievement was the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision, the landmark court ruling against segregated schools and the doctrine of \"separate but equal.\" The Dwight D. Eisenhower administration, however, refused to enforce the decision, and there was no existing movement to make enforcement happen. But Brown set off a strong segregationist backlash - the campaign of \"Massive Resistance,\" spearheaded by Southern Democratic congressmen, with the quiet acquiescence of other Democratic officials. This racist counterattack reinforced McCarthyism, with the NAACP outlawed as subversive in some Southern states, and its members fired from public employment.\n\nSouthern business, professionals, and the middle class sponsored the formation of the \"respectable\" white supremacist Citizens' Councils. The Citizens' Councils and police departments across the South provided cover for the reinvigorated Ku Klux Klan to terrorize rural black people. This white racist reaction effectively held back the fledgling movement during three long years between Montgomery and the eruption of the sit-in movement in Greensboro, North Carolina. But it was the ferment of those years, the demonstrations and the fight back, that kept the Montgomery spirit alive - and was laying the basis for the mass upsurge of the 1960s.\n\nMontgomery's aftermath clarified that traditional national black organizations would not engage in militant, mass actions; new organizations were needed for the fight. Bayard Rustin was pivotal to this development. Rustin conceived the idea for the first new organization, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). He was the agent for creating the relationship between A. Philip Randolph and Martin Luther King Jr that became the force behind national mass actions.\n\nRandolph and Wilkins were, prior to King, the most prominent black leaders nationally. Randolph was the most successful black trade unionist in American history. He organized the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters (BSCP), the only independent black trade union, and later headed the 1930s mass National Negro Congress . Randolph's greatest success was in forming the all-black March on Washington Movement (MOWM) in 1941, which demanded racial equality in defense plants and the integration of the armed forces. It threatened demonstrations that could disrupt defense preparations on the eve of World War II.  Roosevelt, allied to the Dixiecrats, fought the MOWM and its demands - but was forced to capitulate, and issued an executive order that created the Fair Employment Practices Committee (FEPC).\n\nUntil the FEPC, racist employers kept most black workers confined to farm, service, menial, and household servant work. The FEPC set off a vast migration, as black workers went from poverty wages in the South to union wages and conditions in Northern war factories.\n\nRandolph's prestige came from his efforts that changed black social conditions to a greater degree than any of his contemporaries, until King, were able to achieve. Bayard Rustin became a national figure in the civil rights movement through his position as the coordinator of the Randolph-King forces. These forces began without strong national organization, and Rustin relied heavily upon the YSL and our allies as his troops for mobilizations. Our alliance with Rustin is what gave us a role disproportionate to our size.\n\nRustin was probably the most talented mass organizer that the US left has produced. His planning genius was connected to his visionary political ideas and tactics. A socialist and radical pacifist, Rustin was an openly gay man, which made him a target for harassment in the homophobic 1950s. Rustin paid the price: arrests, slanders, demotions, firings, being banned for years from civil rights prominence. He repeatedly overcame these setbacks and was restored to leadership because of his unique talents.\n\nMovement histories often overlooked, minimized, or depreciated Rustin's role until gay consciousness restored acknowledgement of his importance. Neither A. J. Muste nor King would defend Rustin from attacks about his sexuality. The YSL, with liberated sexual views unusual in the conservative 1950s, defended his sexuality and sexual rights; it was another bond in our alliance.\n\nRustin's experience of mass organization stretched back to his Young Communist League membership, when he helped organize a successful bus boycott against job discrimination in New York City. He left the CP in opposition to its support for US entry into World War II and became an assistant to Randolph in the MOWM. From the mid-1950s on, he was Randolph's closest political collaborator.\n\nPrior to Montgomery, Rustin was the executive secretary of the War Resisters League, and the primary organizer of the radical pacifist current led by Muste, which dominated a number of interlocking organizations including the WRL, the Fellowship of Reconciliation, CORE, and Liberation magazine. The Muste group shared some defining politics with us, to which they gave a pacifist content. Liberation 's inaugural issue in April 1956 raised as its own the slogan, \"Neither Washington nor Moscow, but for the Third Camp,\" and editorially defined Russian Stalinism as \"bureaucratic collectivism.\" That same issue of Liberation included \"Our Struggle,\" King's first article on Montgomery, written in the midst of the conflict, explaining its central lessons as the rise of\n\nThe New Negro . . . a revolutionary change in the Negro's evaluation of himself and his destiny . . . the church is becoming militant . . . economics is part of our struggle . . . and we have discovered a new and powerful weapon, non-violent resistance.\n\nThe WP, renamed the Independent Socialist League (ISL) in 1949, had fraternal ties with the radical pacifist, anti-capitalist, and anti-Stalinist Muste current. Muste was the keynote speaker at the founding conference of the YSL. The ISL and the Muste tendency formed a joint organization, the Third Camp Committee, to oppose imperialism and the Cold War. Its activities during the Cold War included demonstrations against the Francisco Franco dictatorship, the US invasion of Guatemala, and other imperialist crimes. Common activity, based on common principles, with the Muste group furthered our acceptance within the civil rights and peace movements, and was our original link to Rustin.\n\nRustin was dispatched to Montgomery by Randolph and Muste in February 1956, when it seemed the bus boycott might weaken. Coretta Scott King was a longtime admirer of Rustin's work, easing his introduction to Martin Luther King Jr. Rustin had long, deep, imaginative, even transformative discussions with King that began their decade-long creative alliance. Rustin was King's original guide in nonviolent resistance, as well as a political adviser and tactician to King, who was just beginning his political career.\n\nKing had tremendous respect and admiration for both Randolph and Muste, and Rustin was his first link to them and their world. This relationship would allow Rustin to construct the Randolph-King alliance as the mass action alternative to the existing civil rights strategy.\n\nRustin's Montgomery experience led him to formulate some key ideas. The first was that, at this historic juncture, the black church was the only independent institution capable of mass black mobilization. Rustin insisted that whatever its conservative limitations, the black church could be neither ignored nor circumvented; no successful effort to advance the struggle was possible without it.\n\nAs the Young Socialist Challenge reported, Rustin said in a May 6, 1957, speech at a YSL meeting:\n\nIn Montgomery . . . throughout the South and in the North, the Negro churches have been the rallying point of a gigantic mass movement . . . The church is the one representative institution which is universal to the Negro community.\n\nRustin drew the conclusion, and convinced King, to form the SCLC, comprising those black churches and ministers committed to direct action and mass mobilization. Rustin was King's nominee to be executive director of the SCLC, until vetoed by other ministers because of Rustin's homosexuality and radicalism.\n\nYSL members were convinced of Rustin's view that the black church was essential to organizing the civil rights movement at this opening stage. It was the key lever to set in motion the mass struggle from below, which would later take other, more militant organizational forms in SNCC, CORE, the Deacons for Defense and Justice, the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, and black power organizations.\n\nAnother strategic Rustin contribution that influenced the early movement was his theory of \"social dislocation.\" Social dislocation argues that mass civil disobedience could impose upon the racist white power structure a situation of social chaos, forcing it to respond. The disruption of US life could \"dislocate\" the racist functioning of \"normal American society\" by shifting the burden and consequences of racism onto the upholders of the status quo.\n\nThe Montgomery bus boycott was victorious when the carpool system bankrupted the bus company, strategically changing the balance of power by placing the costs of segregation onto the municipal authorities. The pain and humiliation of segregation and racism could be shifted so that not just black people suffered, which the United States tolerated, but racists were forced by inconvenience or loss to share the burdens and costs of institutionalized racism - or make changes.\n\nRustin was a profound source in making the boycott a national story. He had an intense impact on us as the boycott was happening. Shortly after he returned from Montgomery, in April 1956 there was an all-day Philadelphia Third Camp Conference, sponsored by the ISL, the YSL, and the WRL. The speakers were Rustin, Muste, and Michael Harrington , national chairman of the YSL.\n\nIn his speech, \"The Meaning of Montgomery,\" Rustin interpreted the bus boycott as a triad of significance: a watershed event in black history, a labor upsurge in the South, and a part of the revolt against colonial domination. The United States, Rustin held, had brought its colonial subjects from Africa home, and this revolt was similar to the ongoing international struggles for national liberation. The concept that black people represented an internal colony inside the United States had previously been advanced by the CP and was popularized a decade later by the Black Panther Party.\n\nRustin ended his remarks by saying that third-camp socialists had a duty to take part in this movement for racial equality and anti-colonialism. He continued this message with a speaking tour of college campuses that included YSL forums.\n\nIt was in building Northern solidarity for Montgomery that our active collaboration with Rustin was cemented. Rustin cofounded a new, small organization, In Friendship, with civil rights veterans Ella Baker, later godmother of SNCC, and Stanley Levison, later King's fundraising and political adviser. In Friendship's purpose was to provide \"economic assistance to those suffering economic reprisals in the efforts to secure civil rights.\" In Friendship's first major event was a Madison Square Garden 20,000-strong rally, the largest such event since the March on Washington Movement. It was held a month after the Philadelphia conference, and for the first time, considerable on-the-ground organizing was provided by YSL and ISL members, who showed their competency, professionalism, and nonsectarianism.\n\nIt was a role that might have been precluded in previous years by the Communist Party's hegemony on the Left. A second fundraiser was held in December 1956, featuring Duke Ellington, Harry Belafonte, and Coretta Scott King. These events were the start of the ongoing working relationship between Rustin and the YSL, two of whose members - Tom Kahn and Rachelle Horowitz - became his main assistants.\n\nThe partnership with Rustin was our entry into collaboration with Randolph and King. The only downside of this relationship developed years later, when Rustin became the main spokesman in the civil rights movement for the rightward-moving Max Shachtman group.\n\nThree mass demonstrations took place in Washington, DC, in the years between Montgomery and the 1960 sit-in movement. They were the first large-scale protests at the nation's capital since the 1940s. Each demonstration showed the determination to sustain the fight for civil rights in the face of the Southern racist backlash and federal government stonewalling. During the years when there was no ongoing national mass movement, these marches were stepping-stones to the 1960s and dress rehearsals for the March on Washington of 1963. The organizing center for the marches was on 125th Street in Harlem, at the BSCP or other union offices.\n\nRandolph and King were the cochairmen who coopted other luminaries as cosponsors. Rustin was organizer, Kahn and Horowitz his chief assistants. The YSL and its allies were the cadres responsible for the \" Jimmie Higgins \" work of building the marches, publicizing them, getting the endorsements, confirming speakers, and mobilizing people through carpools and buses.\n\nThe first march, the Prayer Pilgrimage, was named after a one-day demonstration in Montgomery in which, to show their resolve, people walked to work as opposed to using the carpools. The following two events were the Youth Marches for Integrated Schools. The political backdrop to all three marches was that, despite the Brown v . Board of Education decision of 1954, the federal government had done nothing to implement school desegregation in the South.\n\nIn the Brown v. Board of Education case, the board of education was that of Topeka, Kansas. Schools were segregated in a number of Northern and Border states, including Delaware, Maryland, Missouri, and Kentucky, as well as southern areas of Illinois, Indiana, and Kansas. Schools in those regions were integrated between 1954 and the early 1960s, but in the Deep South, 99 percent of schools remained segregated in 1963. The courts and the federal government were not enforcing the law; for Brown to become reality, movement pressure was necessary.\n\nAction to force the government to implement the supposedly established \"law of the land\" was the core function of the marches. The Prayer Pilgrimage was held on the third anniversary of the Brown decision, in May 1957. Labor Action reported on a YSL meeting where Rustin insisted that the Pilgrimage was\n\nnot going to pray and wait for the heavens to open up. . . . It will confront a congress which is do-nothing in the area of civil rights. . . .  The issue is not confined to civil rights. . . . Every political question in America today . . . schools, health, labor - is becoming inextricably tied up with the issue of emancipation posed by the developments in the South.\n\nThe Prayer Pilgrimage, which more than 25,000 attended, was the first mass protest in years, the largest civil rights demonstration until that time. Its overwhelming religious character was fortunately interspersed with overtones of militancy. It was the first demonstration sponsored by the SCLC and gave the organization a sense of the broad support it could build nationally.\n\nAt the pilgrimage, King gave his first major speech in the North, placing him on the national stage; in the black media, for the first time, King was heralded as the nation's most important black leader. King's theme was an electrifying call to \"give us the ballot,\" a demand for the federal government to protect black voter registration; if blacks could vote in the South, King maintained, desegregation, including of the schools, would follow.\n\nKing's speech foreshadowed the Southern voter registration drives of the 1960s. King's speech castigated both political parties for betraying justice:\n\nThe Democrats have betrayed it by capitulating to the prejudices and undemocratic practices of the Southern Dixiecrats. The Republicans have betrayed it by capitulating to the blatant hypocrisy of right-wing, reactionary northerners. These men so often have a high blood pressure of words and an anemia of deeds.\n\nLabor Action celebrated the spirit of resistance the pilgrimage represented, but slammed the absence of leading union officials and liberals:\n\nMany moods and many tendencies came together in Washington. . . . But if one element stands out above all others it is this: the Negro movement expresses its determination to press forward for democracy - against the old parties, if need be; in the face of the labor officialdom, if need be; without the public support of hypocritical liberals, if need be.\n\nKing's speech at the Prayer Pilgrimage signaled the new movement's defiant refusal to allow the white liberal establishment to set the pace of change. Against calls to revert to passivity, King argued that \"Southern Negroes . . . will not and cannot retreat.\"\n\nThe first Youth March for Integrated Schools occurred the next year, in October 1958, focused on trying to force the federal government to intervene in Little Rock, Arkansas, against governor Orval Faubus, who violently obstructed school integration, eventually closing the high schools for a year. Some 12,000 students demonstrated for integration, in what was seen as the start of the student civil rights movement.\n\nRustin toured college campuses in New York City with Jackie Robinson to build the march, and King spoke at NYC churches. As historian Daniel Levine writes, \"The whole thing was a shoestring operation. . . . Most of the support came from labor unions, primarily those unions in which black workers were an important part of the membership.\"\n\nThe march was organized along lines that Michael Harrington outlined in his instructions to Young People's Socialist League (YPSL) branches, into which the YSL had just merged. Rustin would speak only on campuses with YPSL branches, who were the force organizing for the march. Two meetings would occur. First, a large public meeting would mobilize for the demonstration, for which the YPSL was to seek broad sponsorships from the NAACP Youth Council, the student government, and campus progressive groups. The second meeting would be a YPSL internal membership meeting, in which Rustin would speak on the role of socialists in the civil rights movement, and on the strategy and tactics socialists should employ in building the movement's next steps. King was the featured speaker at the Youth March, but after he was stabbed and hospitalized, Coretta Scott King filled in as primary speaker.\n\nA second Youth March followed six months later, in April 1959, attended by 25,000 people and accompanied by petitions signed by hundreds of thousands of students demanding federal support for school integration. \"More than three hundred buses, half of them from outside New York,\" historian Maurice Isserman writes, arrived in DC. King, Harry Belafonte, Jackie Robinson, and Tom Mboya, chairman of the All-African People's Conference, all spoke.\n\nThe structure of the demonstration was similar to the first. Randolph and King called the march and received cosponsorship from the NAACP, while Rustin organized it, with the YPSL the major organizing force on the ground across the country. As Isserman writes, \"New recruits helped out at the Youth March headquarters in Harlem and elsewhere around the country; these recruits included Bob Moses, then a New York City high school teacher, and Eleanor Holmes . . . then a student at Antioch College.\"\n\nIn Chicago, the YPSL was able to use its influence within the NAACP, the United Auto Workers, and the United Packinghouse Workers of America to mobilize buses for the April 18 march. King linked the campaign to a broader effort to \"advance democracy in the South.\"\n\nThe three marches demonstrated the potential national scope of the movement, but the demand for federal intervention in the South was ignored by President Eisenhower, met with silence by the liberal establishment, and not covered by most of the white press. As an editorial in Labor Action succinctly declared, \"White liberals talk, Southern reaction acts.\"\n\nBut a new generation of young black people felt that they could not wait for court rulings or for the federal government to confront the apartheid system. Labor Action captured the mood of frustration and anger simmering among segregation's opponents at the inaction of the establishment:\n\nThe responsibility for the fact that there has been no break in the defiance of the Supreme Court's integration order in the Deep South rests to no small degree on the shoulders on the national leadership of both political parties. Their shameless capitulation to the Southern racists has actually encouraged the latter's defiance of the court order.\n\nBrown v. Board of Education appeared to mean little more than the paper it was written on.\n\nThe years between 1956 and 1960 were a period of racist backlash and also of ideological ferment preparing the next great wave of struggle. Revolutionary socialists' experience in building solidarity with Montgomery, organizing the three Washington marches, and forging close alliances with key movement leaders solidified us as a part of the activist core preparing movement revival. Some activists of the '60s began their political life as organizers for the marches - among them, Bob Moses of SNCC and the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, and Ezell Blair, one of the four students who began the Greensboro lunch counter sit-in.\n\nIn these years of ferment, a civil rights subculture was created, developing a new generation of fighters who emerged, to the surprise of the world, seemingly overnight in the 1960 sit-ins and solidarity picketing. The YSL/YPSL was a visible part of this subculture that fused activism with education, in a renewal of the tradition of abolitionism - a \"new abolitionism,\" as Howard Zinn called it .\n\nOur contribution was not only as movement fighters, but also in political education in the movement subculture. YPSL held classes and reading groups on Reconstruction, the populist movement, Scottsboro, the CIO upsurge. We read Du Bois, C.L.R. James, C. Vann Woodward, Langston Hughes, Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, and James Baldwin, a one-time YPSL member who would occasionally speak for us. These classes and discussions were part of the intellectual culture in which activists for the 1960s civil rights movement were being formed. To be taken seriously in movement discussions, people needed to know the Harlem Renaissance, Scottsboro, Reconstruction, populism.\n\nA dynamic political culture, of which we were an essential part, developed in the late 1950s, as the gathering momentum for social justice broke conformity and prefigured the 1960s. We established a strong position in the formative years of the movement; the test would be how we used these positions in the mass upsurge of the 1960s.\n\nJoel Geier has been a revolutionary Marxist activist for over six decades.

      "text": "Black or Bot? The Long, Sordid History of Co-opting Blackness Online\n\nConcept Rxch\n\nMorgan Jerkins SEPTEMBER+OCTOBER 2022 ISSUE\n\nIn late February, just after Russia invaded Ukraine, my Twitter feed began filling up with videos showing Black exchange students being refused passage on trains fleeing the escalating conflict, while white students had no problem boarding. But not everyone was buying it. In a now-deleted tweet, Teen Vogue Editor-in-Chief Versha Sharma shared a Washington Post article reporting on the spread of disinformation, and added, \"as videos go viral, a reminder about verifying sources before sharing-and a reminder that Russia disinfo ops have specifically targeted Black people in the past with fake accounts and media.\"\n\n\"The videos and the ppl are real,\" Q. Anthony Omene, creator of RZNWA Media, who had been amplifying the voices of those speaking out about anti-Black racism in Ukraine, shot back in response. Omene and others raising concerns were not part of a disinformation campaign, he asserted, but rather real people who had been in contact with African students who were struggling to escape. \"People were accusing me of being a Russian bot,\" he tells me, wondering whether his internationalist politics and identity as a communist played a role in why both white and Black users distrusted him. \"I still get called to this day a Russian disinformation agent.\"\n\nWhen Kimberly St. Julian-Varnon, a historian at the University of Pennsylvania who focuses on Black identity in the Soviet Union, delved into the conversation, she too came under fierce attacks. Media outlets were asking her for the provenance of one of the videos, so St. Julian-Varnon posed the question on Twitter: \"do we have a source for this video?\" The question triggered something she wasn't quite expecting: \"People came after me,\" she recalls. \"People were like, 'You're being racist,' 'You're white,' 'You're supporting white supremacy.'\"\n\nThe bigotry that African students faced at the border was in fact real . But Sharma and St. Julian-Varnon's suspicions weren't unfounded: Bots, particularly those from Russia, have been known to pose as Black people on Twitter. Online, the existential question of who someone truly is becomes fertile ground for chaos agents to further ignite painful interracial tensions. This discord serves to perpetuate racism, which has always been founded on lies. As feminist researcher and blogger Sydette Harry says, \"Racism is disinformation. Racism has been a form of this since almost every single iteration of mass communications, especially public [ones].\"\n\nThis manipulation of Blackness for political gain was on full display during the 2016 election. According to a 2018 New York Times report , Russia's Internet Research Agency (IRA), which fueled the country's influence campaign and was owned by a close Putin ally, \"created a dozen websites disguised as African American in origin, with names like blackmattersus.com, blacktivist.info, blacktolive.org and blacksoul.us.\" A report by the Senate Intelligence Committee on Russia's interference found that, on Facebook, more than 66 percent of the ira's advertising content contained the word \"race\"; five of its top 10 Instagram accounts were focused on African Americans and issues pervading Black communities; its Twitter page was full of stories about race and racism, such as the NFL kneeling protests; and 96 percent of its YouTube content was devoted to \"racial issues and police brutality.\"\n\nYet the 2016 election wasn't the first time Russians had targeted African Americans. This particular subset of the culture war has been brewing for years, tracing back to the knotted web of political agendas on both sides of the hemisphere.\n\nBack in the 1920s and '30s, when African Americans were fleeing by the thousands to the North to escape racial terrorism in the South, the USSR saw an opportunity. Although anti-Semitism was very much present, racial hierarchies were not as entrenched in the Soviet Union as they were in the United States, according to Meredith Roman, an associate professor at SUNY Brockport, who specializes in comparative Soviet and African American history. In fact, under Lenin, an official motto was \"Workers and oppressed peoples of all countries, unite!\"\n\nIn Moscow, organizations such as Comintern (Communist International) reached out to African Americans and Black people throughout the diaspora to spread communism and galvanize resistance to their capitalist oppressors. These organizations often created posters to spread their messages. One showed two images: an illustration of a Black man in chains beneath the Statue of Liberty with the caption \"under capitalism,\" next to an image of a happy, diverse crowd with the caption \"under socialism!\"-the idea being that Black people would be equal in the USSR. This propaganda worked. Increasing numbers of African and African American students went to the USSR to study. As economic opportunities narrowed for American blue-collar workers in the 1930s, Soviet companies recruited them to help power their new factories. Disenchanted intellectuals also made the journey.\n\n\"Paul Robeson, W.E.B. Du Bois-they made frequent trips to the Soviet Union and saw that there was good in having this country, a superpower, essentially being able to expose the anti-Black racial violence of the so-called 'leader of the free world,'\" Roman explains. But as the Soviet Union began to collapse, neo-Nazi groups proliferated throughout Eastern Europe. Starting in the early '90s, attacks not only on people of African descent, but also on Asians and non-Slavic people, such as people of the Caucasus, became more frequent. (People of the Caucasus were called chernye , which means \"black\" in Russian, whereas Black people were called negry . To put it simply, people of the Caucasus were treated similarly to those who are Black in the West.)\n\nNevertheless, the USSR's strategic fanning of racial animus was a Cold War feature, notably reaching the world of sports. In his 1999 book, The Sword and the Shield , historian and former KGB officer Vasili Mitrokhin detailed how, during the lead-up to the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, Soviet intelligence officers masqueraded as the KKK by forging letters and sending them to African and Asian countries to dissuade the Olympic committees of those nations from sending their best athletes. One of the letters stated, according to NPR: \"The Olympics-for the whites only...African monkeys! A grand reception awaits you in Los Angeles! We are preparing for the Olympic games by shooting black moving targets.\"\n\nDecades later, when Donald J. Trump was running for president in the 2016 election, Russia saw an opportunity again. This time, it wasn't through anti-­racist propaganda but quite the opposite: digital Blackface to spread alt-right ideologies around the world.\n\nThe foundation for foreign agents to meddle with online identities had already been set in the United States. In 2013, New York Times bestselling author and feminist Mikki Kendall started a popular Twitter hashtag called #SolidarityIsForWhiteWomen as a critique of the support given to self-proclaimed male feminist Hugo Schwyzer, who had recently admitted that he criticized Black feminists as a way to boost his career. One of his marks was Sydette Harry. In her words, \"[Schwyzer] admitted that he was outright targeting us because it was easy to get white women to ignore racism and to ignore whatever we were saying because of our big, bad attitudes.\"\n\nThe hashtag was hugely popular. But soon, 4chan users began to masquerade as Black women on Twitter as a way to further fracture digital feminism. \"They would fake being Black women and start fights with white women,\" Harry says. After attention around the hashtag faded, the fake accounts stuck around , only to show up again during the Gamergate controversy the following year. The trolls used the accounts as \"cover for when they were targeting Black women,\" says Shireen Mitchell, technology analyst and founder of Digital Sisters/Sistas Inc., and when they were \"showing up in gamer spaces pretending to be Black.\"\n\nHow do bots and trolls so successfully impersonate Black people? As André Brock, an associate professor at Georgia Tech's School of Literature, Media, and Communication, says, \"Black online discussions are internal yet not private; anyone can see it. White folks don't have to physically venture to Black enclaves to consume Black culture.\"\n\nOf course, Blackness has been co-opted in American culture for over a century. The appropriation of African American vernacular in particular goes back to the 1920s. \"Think about the jazz age, the beatniks in the 1950s and hipsters and so on,\" says Taylor Jones, a quantitative social scientist and linguist who focuses on African American English (AAE). \"This is what linguists call 'covert prestige.' The idea is that they [white people] have an air of cool with things that are problematically associated with African Americans.\" Online, Blackness becomes an exportable product that is accessible to anyone, hence why Black people are vulnerable to co-opting: Their identities are seen as accessories, elements to be adopted or discarded whenever one wants. \"Digital capacity to encode Blackness is what makes it exploitative,\" Brock says. If a chaos agent believes that they can mimic Black speech, then they in turn can become Black online.\n\nThese efforts aren't always successful: Many Black Twitter users can spot bots and trolls from a mile away. \"They don't think we're intelligent. They don't pay attention to grammatical or syntactical rules or rules of interaction with audiences,\" Brock explains. But bots are able to masquerade as Black via AAE because although Black people can spot the inaccuracies, the wider public cannot. The study of AAE is a fairly recent academic field, and its relative infancy, compounded with racism, is why many people and algorithms-bots, trolls, Twitter users, luddites, and the larger American public-don't know, or respect, its complex system of rules, structures, morphologies, and discursive strategies. If the public cannot understand the dialect being badly mimicked, they cannot mobilize to thwart these targeted attacks on Black people. Online, people can claim to be a member of any marginalized group, Jones explains, \"and it works because if you don't interact with anybody from that group on a regular basis, then how would you be able to evaluate it?\"\n\nDigital fraud is such a pervasive phenomenon that even those who are Black are using it to insult other Black people who do not perform their Blackness in a way that is arbitrarily acceptable. \"Twitter has become increasingly political and there's a really vocal contingent of folk that have become gatekeepers,\" Brock asserts. In his words, \"The easiest charge to level against somebody online is to say not only are you not down with the struggle, you're not even a real person.\" Both Omene and St. Julian-Varnon-the former a communist (antithetical to American politics) and the latter an empiricist, who asked for verification of a video depicting racism (and therefore not \"down with the struggle,\" St. Julian-Varnon reflects)-were seen as being fake or complicit in upholding white supremacy, simply because their perspectives ruffled feathers online.\n\nRussian disinformation agents, the far right, and any online troll will continue to capitalize on our rifts until we acknowledge racism and its sociopolitical implications. \"As long as we ignore our history and its real legacies in producing racial inequalities in terms of policies and practices,\" Roman, the SUNY historian, says, \"the Kremlin [is] going to try and exploit these vulnerabilities not with the purpose of offering refuge but to challenge the United States and make it look bad.\" Of course, Twitter does not allow for a nuanced discussion of Blackness on any side of the world. \"There's levels to this,\" St. Julian-­Varnon laments, \"and of course when you're on Twitter, you can't explain things in 280 characters.\"\n\nSo how do we rectify this issue? Mitchell, the technology analyst, says the first step is to acknowledge that the majority of this online impersonation and targeting happens to Black women. \"We are not admitting that,\" she says. \"We culturally, societally, don't have empathy when Black women are being harmed. Algorithms eventually know who to protect and who not to. The algorithms know not to protect Black women.\" No site can protect the marginalized if its creators do not value their voices or safety.\n\nHarry gave me a more practical tip: \"If you are ever finding that you have an account that is very inauthentic and you are worried about what to do next, don't automatically block the account. If they have under 100 followers, go to who they follow and block every locked account.\" The accounts that are locked, the ones she can't see into, are usually the ones that coordinate malicious activity, she points out, so blocking them will help dampen their power.\n\nAside from that, experts like Harry and Mitchell are not optimistic about the tide changing. When Harry has raised concerns about online impersonation and harassment while speaking on panels about digital technology and social media, she has felt ignored or undervalued for her insight. \"I'm not sure if it's actually fixable,\" she says, \"the damage we've done to the discourse around how to find truth online.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "When Did Negroes Become Nerds?\n\nMark Anthony Neal never fails. He finds a way to use his love of black music to talk about everything black at once. This time, he's gotten at something that's been worrying me for awhile now: when, and why, did public black culture become so degraded? I don't just mean rap's excesses but the paltry cultural footprint we're leaving these days when we used to mesmerize with our art.\n\nNo matter how much harder being black used to be, at least we knew we were the coolest people on earth. Hang us from trees though whites certainly did, they still envied us our style and rightfully so. We bad! and the world couldn't keep its eyes off us, on stage, screen or vinyl. The Temptations, afros, Chuck Berry, Lena Horne, The Cotton Club, jazz, blues, gospel. Now, public black culture is mostly rap, reality shows, overwrought r&b and over-priced clothing lines. Neal notes:\n\nIn his too-brilliant-to-be-dismissed collection of essays bloodbeats: vol. 1, Los Angeles cultural critic Ernest Hardy writes that \"selling blackness is permissible in the mainstream marketplace; celebrating it is not. Few folks know the difference.\" The occasion for Hardy's observation was the release of the music video for Janet Jackson's \"Got Till It's Gone,\" of which he writes that the video \"not only works the artfulness and artsiness that lie at the heart of everyday blackness but envisions a world of African cool, eroticism and playfulness that is electrifying in its forthrightness.\" \"Got Till It's Gone\" was released a decade ago and Hardy's argument is no less true today. Indeed blackness seems an industry unto itself, accessible on myriad media platforms and as pervasive as the air; there's rarely a moment where one can't conceivable choke on blackness-especially as the remote surfs past another reality show under-written by the Viacom Corporation. But where does one celebrate blackness at this moment?\n\nBlackness is everywhere but it doesn't seem to be about much. Ironically, this occurs to me on the ever rarer occasions when black artistry does what it's supposed to, what it used to do so much more reliably-remind me that blackness is amazing. Dreamgirls, the Color Purple and Corinne Bailey Rae shocked me. They made me cry; all those beautiful shades of black and all that talent. I had no idea how much I'd missed seeing myself being incredible, transcendant. Seeing blackness loved . They literally made me ache a little-I have to get out more-and realize that I missed blackness. I think the world does, too. 50 Cent is a poor replacement for Curtis Mayfield.\n\nMy days are filled with race. It's how I make my living when it used to be how I lived my life. But integration came and now, most of the time, blackness is work-Jena 6, Don Imus, Dog the Bounty Hunter , nooses, Barack Obama, predatory lending and crack-powder cocaine sentencing disparities. Blackness as problem, as politics. Blackness as duty and something for which I have to travel-back home to see the family, a soul food restaurant, a post-scandal rally. My bi-racial children wouldn't know collards and fried chicken if they tripped over them or how eight people shared one bathroom in the home their mother grew up in. They'll never be able to enjoy the bilingual's blessed retreat into Ebonics after a hard day fitting in on the job and they'll never know what they're missing. All they do know is when Mommy's talking to Grandma, though, because she \"talks funny\". At 6 and 4, they already sound like nerds, not Negroes. I'm as proud of their advanced vocabularies as I am worried that they'll grow up incog Negro . Credentialed, but bland. In an integrated world, how are they supposed to access a cultural blackness? There's a limit to how many times can I make them watch the Flip Wilson tapes I bought from Time-Life Books.\n\nWe eggheads are doing our part; what's up with the black artist contingent? It used to be much harder to be black but it was also a hell of a lot cooler. Ellington, Gaye and Pryor saw to that. Did they leave so few successors?\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Crime and the Counterculture\n\nColumbia Pictures/Entertainment Pictures via ZUMA\n\nOver at National Review they've reprinted a long review essay of Gene Dattel's \"fearless, eye-opening\" new book, Reckoning with Race: America's Failure . I tried to read the whole thing, but I'll confess that after several thousand words telling me that northerners have long been racists too, I sort of gave up. Surely this isn't news to anyone? \"I have never seen, even in Mississippi and Alabama, mobs as hateful as I've seen here in Chicago,\" Martin Luther King Jr. said in 1966, and evidence for brutal and widespread northern racism both before and after that is plentiful. It's hardly a secret.\n\n(That said, it's still true that legal slavery was worse than even circumscribed freedom, and statutory Jim Crow was worse than cultural bigotry. It matters that we hold two thoughts in our minds at once: racism wasn't confined to the South, but it was still quite a bit worse than it was in the North.)\n\nAnyway, the point of these thousands of words turns out to be simple: Dattel is apparently making the case that the rise in \"black pathologies\" starting in the 1960s is the fault of blacks themselves and the pernicious effects of 60s counterculture, not white racism and oppression. After all, as reviewer Myron Magnet says:\n\nAmerica fought a war to end [slavery], had a civil-rights movement to try to erase its malign remnants, and spent decades on affirmative action and other nostrums to expunge even the faintest remaining traces. Whatever white Americans could do to atone for and repair the damage they caused, they have done, as much as imperfect humans in an imperfect world can do.\n\nWe've done absolutely everything we could do. Everything! Later in the review, Magnet summarizes The Dream and the Nightmare , which he wrote in the 90s:\n\nIn that book, I argued that the counterculture's remaking of mainstream white American culture in the 1960s - the sexual revolution; the fling with drugs...the belief that in racist America, the criminal was really the victim of society...[etc.] - all these attitudes that devalued traditional mainstream values trickled down from young people and their teachers in the universities, to the media, to the mainstream Protestant churches, to the ed schools, to the high schools, and finally to American culture at large. And when these attitudes made their way to the ghetto, they destigmatized and validated the already-existing disproportionate illegitimacy, drug use, crime, school dropout, non-work, and welfare dependency there, and caused the rate of all these pathologies to skyrocket startlingly in the 1960s and beyond.\n\n....Aghast at the minority-crime explosion that rocked not just the ghettoes but much of urban America, voters began electing officials, especially in New York, who believed that the real victim of a crime was the victim, not the criminal - who ought to be arrested and jailed - and crime fell accordingly.\n\nIn other words, blacks today have no cause to blame their troubles on anyone but themselves. Unless they want to blame it on lefty counterculture. This is pretty putrid stuff, and I don't feel like taking it on right now. Instead, I'm going to change the subject so suddenly you might get whiplash.\n\nHere we go: it's hardened beliefs like this that make it so hard for many people to accept the lead-crime hypothesis that I've written about frequently and at length. A lot of teen pathologies did start to skyrocket in the 60s, but the primary cause was almost certainly lead poisoning. Certainly lead was the proximate cause of increases in crime, teen pregnancy, and school dropout rates. And these effects were more pronounced among blacks than whites, because blacks lived disproportionately in areas with high levels of lead. The opposite is true too: the decline in these pathologies starting in the 90s was due to the phaseout of lead in gasoline.\n\nIn theory, none of this should be too hard to accept. The evidence is strong, and given what we know about the effects of lead on brain development, it makes perfect sense. In practice, though, if lead poisoning was the primary cause of the increase in various pathologies in the 60s and beyond, then the counterculture wasn't. And if the phaseout of leaded gasoline was responsible for the subsequent decline, then the EPA gets the credit, not tough-on-crime policies. And that can't be tolerated.\n\nOn the left, the problems are similar. Liberals tend to dislike \"essentialist\" explanations of things like crime rates because that opens the door to noxious arguments that blacks are biologically more crime prone than whites. As it happens, lead poisoning isn't truly an essentialist explanation, but for many it's too close for comfort. And anyway, liberals have their own explanations for the crime wave of the 60s: poverty, racism, easy availability of guns, and so forth.\n\nThis is why something that ought to be viewed dispassionately as a straightforward scientific hypothesis has such a hard time gaining traction: if it's true, then everyone's pet theories about the 60s have to be seriously reevaluated. And no one wants to do that: on the left, most people want to stick with racism and poverty, and on the right they want to stick with moral decay and black culture.

      "text": "Do White Rappers Try To 'Act Black?'\n\nPhoto: Wikimedia Commons\n\n\"I forgot I was white,\" explains free-style rapper Automattic during a hip-hop Battle on the Indiana University campus. He says this after his lame competitor rhymes that the white and pretty clean-cut Automattic can't be an emcee because he's white and so he should \"stop acting like he's black\"-as though busting out some free-associative poetry is all it takes to be a black person, or that good rhythm is exclusively a black thing.\n\nThis is just one of the scenes in the new educational doc Blacking Up: Hip Hop's Remix of Race and Identity , which tries to figure out what attracts white rappers to hip-hop: admiration or something uglier? The answer, it turns out, depends on the person.\n\nIn the nearly hourlong film, director Robert Clift has hip-hop heavyweights like Public Enemy's Chuck D , Aesop Rock , Sage Francis , M1 from Dead Prez , Power from Wu-Tang Clan -along with some of Indiana's white hip-hop performers-weigh in on the motives behind the white appropriation of black culture, labels like \" wiggers ,\" and charges of minstrelsy. Clift, who is white and a big hip-hop fan, is on a quest to discover whether white rappers \"are transcending race\" or just mimicking \"a degrading idea of what it means to be black\" in the same vein as the minstrel scenes of Al Jolson's day.\n\nThe film traces a long lineage of white (male) musicians who cashed in on black musical traditions, men like Stephen Foster , who wrote Oh Susannah! and wanted to become \"the greatest Ethiopian songwriter of all time.\" (He was white and had never been to Ethiopia.) And Irving God Bless America Berlin who began his career writing \"coon songs.\" Cultural critic Amiri Baraka points out that black bluesmen never gained the fame of white performers who appropriated their styles. But he also notes that it's inevitable for different racial groups living together to steal each other's expressions-especially since the struggles mentioned in many hip-hop albums are universally shared by the working class. Hip-hop lyrics also portray a side of society lost to the common suburbanite, according to Russell Simmons. \"It's an education from people they wouldn't have heard from. And now they do.\"\n\n\"Blacking Up\" gradually explains the difference between white rappers who honestly embrace the hip-hop genre versus those who hawk and mock it for monetary gain. Vanilla Ice, for instance, lied about growing up in Miami's inner city and confesses in the film that he got offered millions to wear \"certain\" clothes, dance \"certain\" ways, and to be a \"novelty act,\" which he did. Indiana rapper Blazek, who is shown flowing in his bedroom closet to sharpen his craft, is a far cry from Mr.\"Ice Ice Baby.\" He's also in a different league from the Upright Citizen's Brigade act \"Cracked Owt,\" in which two white guys pretend to be crack addicts and don fake bling and baggy pants just so they can act out their \"ridiculous fantasy\" of being rappers. That's the MO of a hip-hop minstrel show. \"The bling and the clothes and the attitude-it's still a very narrow notion of what being black in America could possibly mean,\" Maurice Berger, a professor at Manhattan's The New School, says in the film. It also totally misrepresents a musical genre, which groups like Too White Crew could care less about since they believe that hip hop is \"inherently a joke\" anyway. Witness their offensive spectacle below:\n\nSo, ultimately, it's the intent behind a white rapper's performance that determines whether it's legit or mimicry, a point the film makes insightfully. \"No, I didn't want to be black,\" says one hip-hop fan of her high school fixation with the culture. \"I wanted to be cool.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Back at you\n\nIt's pronounced en-toe-zok-ee shan-gay, and she's utterly frank about-well, everything. We caught her just as her novel \" Liliane\" came out.\n\nQ: About this \"Bell Curve\" business-\n\nA. Oh my God, it made me so mad. Do you believe that just because they can't control us, they're gonna say it's Darwinian- [that] they're better?\n\nQ: It's not that they are better, just smarter .\n\nA: Well of course they are-we fed them! They took all the land, all the food-we ate chitlins and they ate beef! But who carried that nice food to them? And who is still talking and thinking? Now all they can say is that they're better? It's not even a new idea!\n\nQ: Toni Morrison writes about the ways we try to get over, around, and underneath our slave history, but it's still there. How do you deal with that?\n\nA: I have spent my life undoing language until it works for me. We must not only repossess the language, we must deslaveryize it.\n\nQ: Do you have any particular audience in mind when you write?\n\nA: I write for young girls of color, for girls who don't even exist yet, so that there is something there for them when they arrive. I can only change how they live, not how they think. I want to say, \"Here, look where you can live, look what you can think.\" I concentrate on giving this to young people because they are the treasurers of black culture.\n\nQ: Do you consider yourself a separatist?\n\nA: No. I'm not trying to go away from anybody. I don't go where my feelings get hurt. If you're going to be nice to me, I'll come.\n\nQ: What is your take on multiculturalism?\n\nA: Multiculturalism is a white people joke. Black people have always been here as different. People need to stop saying that there is one way to be-and then the issue will disappear. I don't tell Navajos they can't speak Navajo. I don't tell Asians they can't eat noodles. Because black people have refused to eat potatoes and cabbage, white people are terrified. Now that we're saying \"I'm talkin' Zulu, I'm changin' my name, my child's goin' to a black school with Muslims,\" white people get upset and have to call it something. Multiculturalism isn't about culture, it's about power.\n\nQ: What are you working on?\n\nA: A play with Ladysmith Black Mambazo. They gave me four lines of a song to work with! It's been the biggest challenge of my intellectual life. It opens in April at Steppenwolf in Chicago. Friends ask why they didn't ask a South African to write it. I tell them [Black Mambazo] wanted a love story. People involved with apar-theid all their lives can't write a love story without talking about apartheid.\n\nQ: Why do you choose to stay in America?\n\nA: I have an American daughter, and she is American. It tickles me to death. When she was three and we lived in Texas, I took her to the town Christmas party. She got up there and sang \"The Yellow Rose of Texas\"! Can you believe that? I'm the great black nationalist mother and my kid is singin' about Texas in front of all these white people! I thought I was gonna die. But it doesn't matter where I live. Just give me a room to write in.\n\nQ: Does your life, or your writing, have any boundaries?\n\nA: I used to have boundaries up all the time, which is limiting. I never want to feel limited. If anything is life changing, being the descendant of a slave is. I went into therapy 10 years ago because I needed to work that out. I've gotten better. Everything about me is more fluid, much less rigid. I'm gonna do everything I can, feel everything I can, until it hurts. Then I'll stop.

      "text": "Donald Glover's \"Atlanta\" Delivers a Witty Take on the African American Experience\n\nTriple threat Donald Glover-writer, actor, and rapper-can now tuck another feather into his cap, as showrunner of Atlanta , a worthy new series premiering September 6 on FX . The 32-year-old Glover, known for his portrayal of the lovable Troy on Community , opted to leave that series after five seasons to pursue a show of his own. With Atlanta , he looked to his own roots on the periphery of the Atlanta drug scene who attended an elite northeastern college to bring a bit of realism to a fictional story.\n\nGlover, a native of Stone Mountain, Georgia, and a graduate of NYU's prestigious Tisch School of the Arts, plays Earn (Ernest), a Princeton dropout and a young dad who is \"technically homeless\" but at the moment is living with Vanessa (Zazie Beets), his ex-girlfriend and the mother of his daughter. Earn's job selling travel deals at the airport only pays him on commission, which means his finances are constantly in disarray-at times he gets so desperate he has to borrow $20 just to take Van, whom he's struggling to win back, to dinner. Discouraged and at his wit's end, Earn approaches his rapper cousin Alfred (a.k.a. Paper Boi, played by Brian Tyree Henry) whose career is beginning to take off locally, and asks if he can be Alfred's manager.\n\nAs is the case with most dramedies, many of the jokes here aren't laugh-out-loud funny, even though Glover, during a previous three-year stint as a writer for 30 Rock , gave us many of Tracy Morgan's absurd lines. Rather, Atlanta has a similar feel to Aziz Ansari's Netflix hit Master of None . It provides an introspective look into the lives of millennial men navigating work, romance, and their own shortcomings as they become painfully aware of the people they've grown up to be.\n\nGlover largely trades in his sillier comedic sensibilities for a more nuanced approach, while bringing much of the same charming awkwardness to Earn that he brought to Troy on Community . As a writer, Glover saves his most humorous lines for Darius (Keith Stanfield), Paper Boi's hilariously enigmatic right-hand man.\n\nWhat makes Atlanta particularly unique in the world of half-hour comedies is that fact that all its writers are black, and many are rookies in the writers' room. \"I wanted to show white people, you don't know everything about black culture,\" Glover told Vulture last month. The premise of exploring race in a comedic format is compelling enough, but Atlanta also manages to tackle gun violence, mass incarceration, sexual identity, and authoritarian abuse in the Black community (all within the first four episodes). Glover relies on humor, not preaching, to get his serious points across.\n\nIn the debut episode, Earn runs into a (presumably) old friend, a white man around his age. The friend uses the N-word while telling Earn a story about a party he'd attended, but he doesn't use it when he tells the story to Paper Boi-a discrepancy highlighting flawed notions of whether, when, and with whom it's appropriate for a white person to use the word.\n\nIn another episode, Paper Boi, now a rising star, spots a child playing outside with a toy gun pretending to shoot another child and proclaiming he's \"just like Paper Boi.\" The rapper's efforts to set the kid straight are lost on the child, thwarted by Paper Bio's public persona. Elsewhere, as Earn awaits bond after being on a weapons charge after pulling a gun from his cousin's glove compartment, another man in the jail's holding area (where most are black) runs into his ex, a trans woman, who's also awaiting bond. In this uncomfortable scene, the other men ridicule the man as a \"faggot.\" Glover then breaks the tension with humor: \"Sexuality is a spectrum,\" he stage-whispers to the distraught guy. \"You can really do whatever you want.\"\n\nBut then our attention is then drawn to a mentally unstable man clad in a hospital gown. Earn asks a guard why the man is even there-\"He looks like he needs help\"-and is told to shut up. Then, after the unhinged man spits some toilet water he's been drinking on a guard, he is repaid with a beatdown.\n\nSocial issues aside, the show gives a dreamlike window into Earn's personal growth (or lack thereof) and his life, which seems to consist of one obstacle after another. \"I just keep losing,\" Earn tells a wise stranger on a city bus. Yet if Atlanta maintains its careful balance of laughs and gritty reality, the show could well prove to be a winner.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "How the Surveillance of Black Hair Can Kill a Child's Spirit\n\nNia t. evans and Arianna Coghill October 9, 2023\n\nMother Jones; Photo courtesy of Tiffany Stubbs\n\nMother Jones; Photo courtesy of Tiffany Stubbs\n\nIn January 2020 , Barbers Hill High School in Mont Belvieu, Texas, made national headlines after suspending a Black student over his dreadlocks, ordering DeAndre Arnold to cut them if he wanted to attend graduation. The incident partly inspired the CROWN Act, a state law that prohibits race-based hair discrimination in schools, housing, and workplaces. But on August 31, reportedly one day before the law was slated to go into effect, Barbers Hill High School disciplined another Black student, Darryl George, over his locs hairstyle. George's parents are now suing Gov. Greg Abbott for failing to enforce the law.\n\nThe episodes at Barbers Hills High reflect a longstanding issue in the United States, particularly in schools where dress codes can discriminate against students. You saw it in the video of a New Jersey high school wrestler forced to cut his locs after a referee claimed that keeping them would forfeit the match. When a North Carolina charter school demanded that a young Indigenous boy cut his hair before returning to class after spring break. Such incidents, widely condemned as racist, have sparked laws similar to the CROWN Act around the country.\n\nDespite these protections, school administrators still enforce policies that target non-white students. Mother Jones spoke with Dr. Bettina Love, a professor of education at Columbia University and author of Punished for Dreaming : How School Reform Harms Black Children and How We Heal , to learn more about how school systems in the United States codify policies that ultimately force students of color to assimilate to whiteness.\n\nHow did we end up with an education system that can suspend Black students for wearing natural hairstyles like locs?\n\nIt's important to note this story isn't just about hair. It's about anti-Blackness. Black people's hair is such an important symbol of our identity. It's about who we are and how we express ourselves. It's an easy signifier to go after but these suspension policies are about us as human beings. Sometimes when we think about racism, we just think about policy. What we miss is how the body is attacked. Our hair is one of the biggest reflections of our blackness and so it is always going to be under attack.\n\nYour new book explores the politics that brought us to this point. How common is it for Black students to be policed and suspended for expressing themselves or their culture?\n\nWhat I tried to do in the book is show how education reform shifted, particularly once [Ronald] Reagan took office, to be extremely anti-Black. There are a few entry points we can look at to understand how we got here. First, we have to start with the very pursuit of integration after Brown v. Board of Education which gutted Black education . Before Brown , we had Black teachers who understood Black culture. Fast forward to 1982 when Reagan declares a war on drugs, which is really a war on Black people.\n\nBy 1984, the Reagan administration comes out with another report called Chaos in the Classroom . It says certain children-they never have to say Black children, but we know who they are talking about-are unruly, disrespectful, and need to be policed. That's when you start to see crime reform, which is tied to the idea that Black people are inherently criminal and violent, merge with school reform. Policing concepts, like broken windows theory and three strikes rules , become education policies. Labels like \"thugs,\" \"crack babies,\" and \"superpredators\" enter public consciousness. There was a united effort by politicians and the media to dispose of Black children through schooling.\n\nSchools have always been hubs of political and cultural battles. But in recent years, conservative politicians and groups have upped the ante, targeting Black history and literature in schools. How have these attacks impacted Black students?\n\nI want to be clear: This is how you create chaos and manufacture crisis. It is the same playbook they used in 1983 with \" A Nation at Risk .\" They are manufacturing crises so they can say that public education is no longer needed. These attacks are about much more than attacking Blackness. We are being used for a larger agenda: to privatize education.\n\nBut students are starting to educate themselves. They are turning to the internet and TikTok. They are saying, \"Well if you say we can't read this, we'll find out what that book is about.\" Young people are curious about why this is happening. They are walking out of school and protesting. They want to know why they're being denied the chance to read and learn. I hope it's making this generation more inquisitive because they will have to seek out new ways to make sense of what is happening. That said, this whole situation is infuriating. Black children shouldn't have to struggle like this. And I want to be clear, this doesn't just impact Black students. What's happening right now impacts all students because Black history is American history. Keeping students ignorant is not how you have a flourishing, thoughtful caring democracy.\n\nThe district superintendent involved in George's case defended the hair policy by claiming it taught students to \"sacrifice\" and \"conform.\" Can you talk about the realities of forced assimilation for students of color?\n\nIt is always important to ask whose culture we need to assimilate to. And the very idea that this student needs to learn to sacrifice while other folks get to have liberties, freedom, and choice is despicable. Why does he have to sacrifice? Where is his freedom? One of my favorite quotes is by Professor Lindsey Stewart and she says white folks believe Black lives are tragic without intervention. That superintendent clearly believes that. That without his rules and policies, this young man will not learn sacrifice. This is a lesson in double standards, not sacrifice. This is a form of killing a child's spirit. Now that student has seen how racism works in this country and how policies can make him disposable.\n\nCan you describe the cultural significance of natural hairstyles in Black communities? Why is it more than \"just hair\"?\n\nWhen I hear these stories, it's a little triggering for me because that could have been me. I have a very similar hairstyle to the young man who was suspended for two weeks. Natural hair defines who we are as Black people.\n\nNo shade to Black people who don't wear their hair natural, but if you do, you're making a commitment to put your Blackness on display. I wear my hair natural for a few reasons. One, it's healthier for my hair and healthier for my body. Two, I am reinforcing that my Blackness is beautiful through my hair. Natural hair is a signifier of my commitment to the beauty of Blackness.\n\nBeyond cultural significance, how does Black joy play a role in self-expression and why is it important that Black children get the opportunity to express themselves?\n\nSo, there's a definition of self-love and it comes from Lizzie Stewart again. And she says that the real essence of Black joy is where whiteness doesn't exist. And for those moments and for those seconds, you are free. That is the Black joy that I want our children to be striving for. There are teachers who can facilitate that kind of joy. But schools as a whole are not doing that work. Most teachers are white women. How would they know how to facilitate Black joy?\n\nWhy is legislation like the CROWN Act necessary? Are there more effective ways to protect Black students in school?\n\nThe fact that we even have to have a CROWN Act says so much about this country. It is unbelievable that we are fighting in 2023 for Black folks to be able to wear their hair the way they want to.\n\nBut we need a few things. Number one is the hiring of Black educators. There's good data out of American University that says if you are a Black student from a low-income family and you have two Black teachers in elementary school, the likelihood that you will graduate increases by 32 percent. It matters to be able to have a teacher who looks like you. We need a true recruitment of Black teachers. We also need to mobilize Black parents. We have a few powerful people changing the course of public education in this country and we need parents -all parents-to understand what's happening.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "White People Often Don't See Damon Young. That's About to Change.\n\nRoss Mantle\n\nWhite people are trying not to see Damon Young. On a chilly December Sunday, he's sitting at the crowded bar of Pittsburgh's Ace Hotel, bent over a plate of eggs, potatoes, bacon, and a side of fruit, attempting to explain the arc of an unconventional writing career that-here in the shadow of the nation's media hubs, after years of underemployment-has finally landed him some money. Real money. Enough to buy a renovated row house with his wife, three-year-old daughter, and, as of two days ago, infant son. It's the kind of comfort that seemed unfathomable when he was growing up a stone's throw from here on \"the hottest block of East Liberty,\" once considered some of the city's most dangerous turf.\n\nYoung isn't easy to not see. A bearded, 6-foot-2 former point guard with a high-top haircut, he's dressed in black jeans and a black cutoff crewneck, the tattoos just visible on his biceps. Nor is he shy, although he does double Dutch his way into conversation: patiently finding the rhythm before leaping in with his soft-spoken baritone. Having spent most of his 40 years here, Young has the local elocution that transforms a word like \"there\" into \"dare\"-the man is Pittsburgh to the core.\n\nIt's a city on the move, or so it thinks. In nearby Bakery Square, the sterile shapes of redevelopment are everywhere: clean, rectangular sidewalks leading to massive, rectangular high-rises built to attract transplants seeking an alternative to, say, Brooklyn, and tech players like Google that would love to boast they had a hand in reviving a once-mighty city's fortunes after decades of postindustrial stagnation. The Ace, which the Wall Street Journal dubbed \"the cutting edge of the city's revival,\" is a century-old former YMCA renovated with a cozy, hipster vibe: white walls, black details, blond-wood coffee tables, and 1960s-style lounge chairs in greens, yellows, and grays. It's something of a second home for Young, who writes by day for his popular website, Very Smart Brothas - VSB to devotees-and has been hitting the Ace lobby late at night to complete his new memoir, What Doesn't Kill You Makes You Blacker . The hotel staffers see him. They give him a nod and smile.\n\nOur fellow diners do not. As Young, between bites, tells me about the blog he co-founded in 2008 with Panama Jackson, a DC-based former congress­ional budget analyst, and a third partner, white people keep blundering into our space. First, a middle-­aged white man reaches directly between us to pay his check. Failing to get the bartender's attention, he lingers, arm outstretched, oblivious to the people he is interrupting, who have stopped eating, stopped talking, and are now staring at him, waiting for him to move-he eventually does. Shortly thereafter, a middle-­aged white woman, without even an apologetic glance, reaches right over Young to grab the hot sauce sitting, clearly in use, next to his plate.\n\nIt is Young's wry commentary on such daily indignities that has made him one of the freshest, most impor­tant black voices on the internet. After the hot sauce grab, he smirks, laughing it off. Welcome to Pittsburgh, his smile seems to say. It's a city Young loves so much that he feels a duty to keep it honest. \"Just tell the fucking truth,\" he wrote on VSB in October , after a white supremacist marched into a local synagogue and murdered 11 worshippers. \"Don't pretend like Pittsburgh is this singular lodestar for justice and progressive thought.\" Yet living outside the media bubble enables him \"to write in a way that isn't self-consciously entertaining but is mindful of the fact that people need to read this.\"\n\nA typical VSB post requires readers to be schooled in both pop culture and the psychic dissonance nonwhite people often experience in their dealings with the majority. Young draws on aspects of white privilege to create viral memes. There's Darth Becky , a mashup of the Star Wars villain and the seductress in Beyoncé's song about infidelity-Young describes her as a \"privileged young White woman who exists in a state of racial obliviousness that shifts from intentionally clueless to intentionally condescending.\" Darth Susan is the workplace version, who uses her whiteness to gain power. And Donald Trump is \" Y'all's Triflin'-Ass President .\" Young is \"rigorous in general, but even in his humor he's rigorous,\" says Akiba Solomon, senior editorial director of the news site Colorlines and co-editor of the anthology How We Fight White Supremacy . \"When he breaks down race stuff in a serious way, he's really rigorous, but his humor also opens cultural doors. It reminds us of who we all are.\"\n\nWhen you stop to think about it, Pittsburgh, home to 20th-century black literary icons such as August Wilson and John Edgar Wideman , is a fitting place for what has come to be one of the web's premiere black culture blogs, with 2 million to 3 million unique monthly visitors. In addition to calling out fundamental truths about the black experience, Young and Jackson write wittily of their personal pains and triumphs. The content speaks directly to black people, even though Young is more than capable of writing for the masses. \"Perhaps this doesn't seem like a big deal,\" he explains in \"I Have Post-Brokeness Stress Disorder,\" a 2018 New York Times op-ed . \"But losing $20 and not missing it enough to tear my home apart looking for it is a relatively new privilege. Five years ago, I could account for every quarter belonging to me.\"\n\nYoung's memoir will inevitably bring his worldview to a wider crowd, but VSB 's demographics skew young, black, educated, and female-a profile that made the website attractive to big media suitors. In 2017, the Spanish-language conglomerate Univision purchased VSB and folded it into The Root , the black online magazine founded by Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr., which it had acquired two years earlier. \"We looked for and recruited writers that reminded us of Damon and Panama before we were finally able to make them part of The Root family,\" says Editor-in-Chief Danielle Belton. \" Very Smart Brothas was edgy and funny and relatable. We wanted to emulate that voice.\"\n\nThe Root had about 7 million unique monthly viewers prior to the purchase. Today, despite factors (like a capricious Facebook) that have suppressed traffic to news sites, it averages more than 10 million. The Root also adopted VSB 's engaged readers, who routinely comment on posts, purchase T-shirts with slogans like \" I Love Bougie Black Girls ,\" and show up at media events.\n\nYoung's most controversial writings, not surprisingly, poke at race and gender orthodoxies. In one post, \" Straight Black Men Are the White People of Black People ,\" he ranked his gender privilege on the hierarchy of racial identity, drawing fierce condemnation. But Young wasn't fazed. \"What's the problem with creating a space that looks out for people who have looked after you?\" he says.\n\nYoung takes pains to note that black women have been crucial at every stage of his career. He wrote poems in college-mainly to impress a woman, he says-and one of his cousins, Pittsburgh artist sarah huny young , built him a website so he could share his work. Jamilah Lemieux, his former editor at Ebony.com , gave him one of his first writing gigs. And then there was Alecia Young, who encouraged him to apply for a city arts grant so he would be able to blog full time. (She married him, too.)\n\nBut it was a gender-related misstep that inspired an entire memoir chapter: \"How to Make the Internet Hate You in 15 Simple Steps.\" In 2012, he had responded to an Ebony piece that argued men should never tell women how to dress to avoid being raped. \"But why can't both genders be educated on how to act responsibly around each other?\" Young wrote on VSB . \"What's stopping us from steadfastly instilling 'No always means no!' in the minds of all men and boys and educating women how not to put themselves in certain situations?\"\n\nThe backlash was immediate, and it was only made worse by a nonapology in which Young doubled down on his point. He eventually reached out to trusted women in his circle and instead of fighting just listened-about times they were blamed for being sexually assaulted. He admitted he was wrong and vowed to do better. \"I have a deep fear of hurting people,\" he told me. \"I don't want to be seen as this kind of person. I don't want my work to be seen as this type of work.\"\n\n\"Visibility is something that Damon has just accepted as a consequence of doing the sort of work he enjoys,\" Lemieux told me. \"I think that's why he's able to attain that feminist education in the way that he did.\"\n\nBack at the Young residence, a.k.a. \"the house the vsb built,\" the scene is surprisingly calm. Zoe, his daughter, is out with his mother-in-law, and infant Levi is napping upstairs with his wife. Young sits on his gray sectional. He appears to be bracing for a dramatic change in pace, personally and professionally. Right now he's in that fuzzy, surreal newborn-parenting phase. But he's also aware that his book, and the publicity it demands, will soon yank him out of his comfort zone-a writer unaccustomed to mainstream attention is about to be the subject of interviews, panel discussions, and critical write-ups.\n\nFor years, he and Jackson have hosted casual meet and greets with readers. A recent one I attended, at a rooftop bar in New York City, had the vibe of a gathering of college friends. A dozen or so black women turned up, and Young and Jackson made small talk while snacking on sliders and facilitating, rather than dictating, the conversation, which is part of what makes the blog resonate with its audience. The memoir, as Young sees it, is a chance to connect with readers at a more leisurely pace and to broadcast his ideas more widely-as a guest on cable programs, for instance, or a speaker on college campuses. One other fringe benefit: It's going to make him a lot harder for white folks to ignore.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Black Studies Matter\n\nBen Stewart, left, head of the Black Students Union at San Francisco State University; George Murray, center with dark glasses, a teacher who was suspended from the university; and Bobby Seale, right, chairman of the Black Panther Party, at a press conference in Oakland, California, on November 21, 1968. AP Photo/Ernest K. Bennett\n\n\"Don't talk race, assimilate. Find a way to purge who you are.\" That's what Ramona Tascoe's father told her when she was young. Tascoe, a former member of the nation's first Black Student Union, was born in Louisiana, but her family moved to San Francisco in 1953. When they got to California, her parents were determined to help their children succeed. That meant, they believed, eradicating any signs of black culture. The young Tascoe pressed her hair straight and practiced pulling in her lips to make them seem thinner.\n\nWhen she was ready to go to college in the mid '60s, Tascoe enrolled at San Francisco State University. At the same time, California was in the middle of a growing black cultural and political revolution-the Black Panthers were headquartered across the Bay in Oakland, and the NAACP was protesting de facto segregation of public schools in San Francisco. The black-power organizers were rejecting the emulation of white beauty standards and cultural norms, and calling for schools and universities to embrace black history and the arts. Tascoe joined the school's Black Student Union, and by 1967, she became the first San Francisco State student arrested during what is still the longest college strike in US history, and what would turn out to be a seminal event that shaped higher education.\n\nHere's what happened: In 1968, SF State faculty member George Murray joined the Black Panther Party and encouraged students to carry arms. In response, the administration asked the schools' president, John Summerskill, to fire Murray. Summerskill refused and was replaced by a president who did fire Murray. This sent the Black Student Union into protests and demonstrations. In response, the new president brought in the cops. To this day, those demonstrations are remembered as some of the bloodiest in university organizing; more than 500 students were arrested and hundreds of students were left with severe injuries. The violence radicalized and politicized many other people on campus in support of the protesters. After five months and hundreds of arrests, the strike ended-but not before the university agreed to establish the new College of Ethnic Studies. Within a year, every state campus in California had a Black Student Union that was pushing for similar reforms. Inspired by the organizers, Latino and Asian American students formed their own unions on college campuses. And similar protests took place at the University of Wisconsin, City College of New York, Duke, and Brandeis University. \"It's the higher education counterpart to Board v. Brown of Education ,\" said Juanita Tamayo-Lott, the former San Francisco State student leader.\n\nA new documentary, Agents of Change , describes the five-month SF State protest and a similar strike at Cornell University through the voices of former students like Tascoe who were involved. The film is a gripping case study of the meticulous organizing, community engagement, and careful planning that went into two of the most effective student strikes in American history.\n\nThe film was recently screened at San Francisco State in front of an audience of students who were involved in their own strike . For several months, students at the university have been protesting proposed budget cuts to the very same Ethnic Studies College that was born out of the 1968 strike. On May 2 this year, four of the student activists began a hunger strike. (The students dubbed their group the Third World Liberation Front 2016-an homage to the 1968 organizers depicted in the film.)\n\nAgents of Change , produced by Frank Dawson and Abby Ginzberg , is the first feature-length documentary about the founding of the SF State College of Ethnic Studies. The film is full of fascinating, archival footage, but its most important point is the central role that black students played in the fight to reform American universities: most notably, they pushed for the expansion of Eurocentric curricula to include intellectual contributions of other racial and ethnic groups, for the hiring of more diverse faculty and better recruitment, and for more humane treatment of students of color.\n\nIn the '60s at SF State, Black Student Union members worked hard to recruit students of color like Tascoe who were from working-class families to attend the predominantly white university. By 1967, the black population at SF State had doubled, and a year after that, it doubled again, according to the San Francisco Chronicle . The group also recruited faculty members, including prominent black intellectuals such as the writer Amiri Baraka and the poet Sonia Sanchez. In the film, Sanchez, who taught at SF State from 1968 to 1969, recalls, \"The black students didn't know anything about themselves. I was in the classroom, writing names [on the blackboard]: Langston Hughes, Du Bois, Richard Right, Marcus Garvey. And I said, 'Which of the names [do] you recognize?' 'MLK and Malcolm.' That was it. Can you imagine?\" Around the same time, student union members drafted a document called, \"The Justification for Black Studies.\"\n\nNearly 50 years later, all but one of the 23 campuses that are part of the California State University system offer ethnic studies classes. According to Dylan Rodriguez, the chair of the ethnic studies department at the University of California-Riverside, \"the departments that sprang up all over the country are the product of ordinary social and student movement organizing. That sets them apart from all other institutions in higher education.\"\n\nBetween 1975 and 2000, the number of ethnic studies programs more than doubled in American universities, according to the most recent 2009 John Hopkins University study. That was a good thing, argues Christine Sleeter, a professor of education at California State University-Monterey Bay who is known for her research on curriculum. In 2011, Sleeter reviewed dozens of studies and research reviews on the impact of ethnic studies classes in universities and public schools, and found that in all but one study the students' academic achievement improved. A 2016 Stanford study of three high schools in San Francisco that implemented an ethnic studies pilot program also found that students in the course improved their overall grades, their attendance rates, and the number of course credits they earned. In the last five years, at least nine school districts in California and others in Arizona and Texas are looking at the possibility of expanding their high school curricula to include more ethic studies courses, according to Sleeter.\n\nBut just as ethnic studies course offerings are expanding at the high school level, they have been in trouble at the college level over the last seven years, as states have searched for ways to reduce budget holes caused by the recession. At the same time, student interest and enrollment in ethnic studies is growing on many campuses, which is why so many students have protested these cuts. In 2011, students at the University of California-Berkeley staged a hunger strike to stem the budget cuts in their ethnic studies program. Two years later, 250 students at Temple University in Philadelphia marched to protest proposed cuts to faculty positions in the department for African American studies. Yearly cuts to ethnic studies programs in California prompted Timothy White, chancellor of the California State system, to establish a temporary moratorium on significant changes to ethnic studies programs in 2014-and to create a task force to survey the state of ethnic studies programs and suggest steps to strengthen them. The final report is still being refined, but a 2015 draft copy surveying 23 campuses found that all ethnic studies departments reported dramatic cuts. More than half of them have gotten smaller since the recession, with increased class sizes, and have reported that they are unable to replace faculty members whenever someone leaves or retires.\n\nDanny Glover: \"They're trying to gentrify this education. But [the college of ethnic studies] is what this city is.\" pic.twitter.com/ws3o8NHbgP\n\n- Jamilah King (@jamilahking) May 9, 2016\n\nAgents of Change documents some of what is happening today, but importantly it highlights the growing resistance to these cuts, often in alliance with the Black Lives Matter activists on college campuses. On May 11, San Francisco State President Leslie E. Wong and four hunger strikers signed an agreement that-bucking the national trend-increased funding for the Ethnic Studies College by 14 percent. \"I'm hoping that our film will reach college campuses especially and illustrate just how much student activism matters,\" Ginzberg said a few days after the signing of the agreement. \"The screening at San Francisco State University was so inspiring. The students there are so savvy. They know the history, they are engaged with the local communities, they are strategic, and they know this is a fight that needs to be refought over and over again.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Email Madness From the Afro-Sphere\n\nAuthorities are planning to open the entire length of the National Mall for Obama's inauguration , a historic first. Planners are estimating that 1.5-5 million folks will be visiting DC for that occasion. (Nice ballpark figure, huh?)\n\nI got the following joke email about it from one of those relatives. The kind who fill your inbox with miracle cures, urban myths Snopes wouldn't dignify with a debunking, and Protestant chauvinism too appalling to reply to. (Yesterday's was a shaggy dog joke about atheists suing for a holiday of their own and being informed by the judge that, as non-believers, they already had one: April 1. Hardy har.) But now I'm glad I hadn't blocked their address. This one made my day.\n\nSince Obama's election, the afro-sphere has been abuzz with joyful outbursts, but this one is the only one to really touch me. It's a trifle, but it's so exuberant and paints such an eloquent picture of blacks' sense of validation as Americans and their sense of family with the Obamas, it makes its own gravy. Pretending to scold, it is instead a clever, jubilant way of celebrating black culture and bragging about having a homey Prez, and makes its peace with individual blacks' inability to lay hands on the magic brother. It says: We can't all be with you there, Obama. But we're there in spirit. There's a party going on in black America.\n\nHere it is; enjoy.\n\nEMAIL:\n\nQuestion #1, where are all of those buses going to?\n\nDo all of these folks BELIEVE they are actually gong to get anywhere NEAR the ceremony? Brothers and Sistas. We can't all go to Washington for the ceremony. The city ain't but so big! \"D.C.\" is smaller than Queens.\n\nYou wasn't ALL INVITED! I heard of one church that has FIFTY buses going to Washington! Have y'all all lost yo minds?! FIFTY BUSES! Where they gonna go? AN' you know some our folks don't do well in the cold! What's Sista Jones and her bad hip gonna do standin on the lawn for three or four hours when it's 10 degrees out? First of all, you know she caint walk from where yall gon hafta leave the bus to where you goan hafta stan', which is gonna be 'bout five MILES from where the President gonna be! An' y'all know ya can't be draggin' all yo lawnchairs, beachchairs, piknik chairs an tables widya! You goanna hafta stand all through the ceremony.\n\n'Sides, by the time all them bad hips an' bad knees gits down there to the lawn, the ceremony be 'bout over! That brings ta mind another thing! Y'all needs to leave on time! This ain't goan be lak no chuch piknik or barbeque, an' it sho ain't goan start two or three hours late like some gospel show.\n\nNow Bam is a brotha, but he know how to handle his bizness! He don't run on CP Time! Them folks ain't goan stand out in that cold all mornin' waitin for the 10,000buses and vans comin' from all over to get there. You chuch folks migh jes as well plan on leaving Sunday mornin'-do all yore singin' an' prayin' on the road! Psalm 95 on I-95! (Check it out. It fits!)\n\nAn' y'all best be plannin' on leavin right afta the ceremony. They ain't goan let y'all jes tie up Pennsavania Avenue all daggone day! I can hear it now - \"WOULD YOU PLEASE LEAVE THE LAWN!\"\n\nThey ain't gonna wait while 20 million black folks line up to have they picture taken standin' in front of the Capital. AN' all your marchin' bands, steel pan ensembles, step teams, drill teams, Pee-Wee football cheerleaders, church choirs, jump-rope teams, Elks, Masons, Bisons, Shriners, Miners, Whiners, Evening Stars, Morning Stars, Falling Stars, Deltas, Sigmas, Kappas, Phi Beta Slammas, and fine Gamma Hammas can not ALL be in the pararde. If you ain't got an invitation ALLREADY, you ain't invited! So jes plan on goin' down, an' soon as you inside city limits get off the bus, take your pictures and LEAVE, cause with alla you peeples tryin to git there at the same time, the closest you likely to get to the capital will probably be Baltimore in the north and Richmond to the South.\n\nMake sure that you SCHEDULE your time off, an' that includes Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. Brack can't be callin' all your employers, an' beein' stuck in traffic on I-95 comin' from the Inauguration doesn't get you no kinda administrative leave!\n\nOne other thing, remember back in the day when we was all still upset about racism in America, an' many of us was convinced that THE MAN was constantly plottin' our extermination?! Remember when everything was seen as an act of racial GENOCIDE - Welfare Reform; requirements that college athletes meet academic standards to be eligible to play; the DISPROPORTIONATE number of brothas in PRISON; drugs; raising academic standards; even birth control!\n\nWell, just suppose there was a way to get ALL of the black people together in one place at the same time. Then it would be relatively easy to get rid of them. Well, as it seems like just about every black person in America is plannin' on bein' at the Inauguration, you don't suppose that all of this could be part of some sinister MASTER PLAN to get rid of black people, do you?\n\nFor myself. I plan on stayin' home that day an' watchin' everything on the tee-vee. Ah'll probably see more of it than any of y'all. Besides all that aroma of all that perfume, hair stylin' chemicals, curried goat and fried chicken on a bus for 16 hours would drive me plum crazy. On the other hand,\n\nI might jes go down to the church that mornin' an' make a few bucks sellin' some brown-paper-bag-gourmet-food. Besides, there's gotta be at least ONE person left to tell about all this.\n\nAnyway, I hope you have a great time and keep Barack an' his family in your prayers! Oh yeah, remember, Jan 20, 2009 @ 7:30 p.m. sharp!

(To be clear, this has long garnered Grandmaison criticism from Black people.)\n\nBut \"No Jumper\" has apparently taken a more explicitly racist turn.\n\nAccording to Media Matters:\n\nOver the past year, No Jumper has delved into platforming viral hate figures, including white nationalists, neo-Nazis, misogynists, and notorious antisemites. The show has a massive reach on social media, with over 4.5 million YouTube subscribers, 1.2 million Twitter followers, 3 million Instagram followers, and 2.1 million TikTok followers. Clips from the podcast are also available on Snapchat and the show has a large Discord following. Additionally, clips of viral hate figures' appearances on the show have been posted on TikTok by various users. ...\n\nGrandmaison, who is white, now invites white supremacists and racists onto a show that has many Black staff members and was born out of covering hip-hop and Black culture. This transitional period for the podcast comes at a time when Grandmaison faces criticism for reports of past predatory behavior.\n\nYou can read about some of that criticism here .\n\nSome of the extremists who've appeared on the \"No Jumper\" platform include Nick Fuentes, the white nationalist invited to dine with Donald Trump late last year , as well as several Black guests and co-hosts who've spread antisemitic conspiracy theories.\n\nEither The Shade Room is woefully ignorant, or it's willfully piping right-wing conspiracy theories to its followers.\n\nAlong with the Media Matters report, I was also made aware of a post published by the gossip outlet The Shade Room this week that  quotes right-wing lawmakers verbatim as they pushed unfounded claims similar to the racist \"replacement theory.\"\n\nIn The Shade Room post, the author quotes Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and other right-wingers referring to the \"central bank digital currency\" conspiracy theory , which essentially claims a global cabal is looking to establish digital currencies to patrol and control their citizens.\n\nThe theory plays on a common theme in right-wing disinformation : that a powerful group of nonwhite non-Americans, including Jewish elites, is seeking to undermine the American way of life.\n\nThe Shade Room also quoted Republican Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Mike Braun of Indiana and Chuck Grassley of Iowa as they whined about the threat posed by the Biden administration's nonexistent plans to create a \"digital dollar.\"\n\nThe idea of these senators - all of whom have blocked voting rights measures and aligned themselves with Trump - pointing elsewhere to highlight alleged dangers to democracy is laughable.\n\nSo either The Shade Room is woefully ignorant, or it's willfully piping right-wing conspiracy theories to its followers (or both).\n\nI'll leave it to you to guess why it is that a blog focused on Black culture is spewing conspiracy theories from anti-Black lawmakers.\n\nIn the meantime, if either of the aforementioned platforms are part of your news diet, I recommend a cleanse.\n\nJa'han Jones is an MSNBC opinion blogger.

And today Ellison, author of the oft-targeted novel \"Invisible Man,\" is in focus.\n\nEllison's essay pondering what the U.S. would look like without Black people addresses literal efforts, waged by President Abraham Lincoln and others, to send free Black people to Africa after the Civil War rather than encourage them to settle in the U.S. But the essay can be seen as a metaphor for the ideological severance of Black history from American history lessons we see taking place in conservative-led schools across the country, and the pitfalls of that crusade.\n\nTake this passage, for example:\n\n[T]here is something so embarrassingly absurd about the notion of purging the nation of blacks that it seems hardly a product of thought at all.

And today Ellison, author of the oft-targeted novel \"Invisible Man,\" is in focus.\n\nEllison's essay pondering what the U.S. would look like without Black people addresses literal efforts, waged by President Abraham Lincoln and others, to send free Black people to Africa after the Civil War rather than encourage them to settle in the U.S. But the essay can be seen as a metaphor for the ideological severance of Black history from American history lessons we see taking place in conservative-led schools across the country, and the pitfalls of that crusade.\n\nTake this passage, for example:\n\n[T]here is something so embarrassingly absurd about the notion of purging the nation of blacks that it seems hardly a product of thought at all. It is more like a primitive reflex, a throwback to the dim past of tribal experience, which we rationalize and try to make respectable by dressing it up in the gaudy and highly questionable trappings of what we call the \"concept of race.\" Yet, despite its absurdity, the fantasy of a blackless America continues to turn up.

A rare condition required him to have two nose surgeries, further isolating him from other kids. But he found a friend in drawing.\n\nBy fifth grade, he said, he realized he had \"a God-given talent.\" Years later, he went to Rutgers University to study engineering to fulfill his mother's wishes for him. But when the consistently solid student failed calculus, \"I knew engineering wasn't for me,\" Adams said.\n\nAbout that time, he came across the art of Charles White , a Black artist whose work centered on poignant images of Black life, and Adams' purpose - and career path - changed. As a freshman, he showed a professor his first oil painting, called \"The Start,\" which depicted a runner set to take off on a race. The professor was so impressed he visited Adams' home to convince his mother to allow her son to change his major.\n\n\"It was like a college coach coming into an athlete's living room to recruit a player,\" Adams said.\n\nHis mother acquiesced, and \"The Start\" turned out to be a symbol for the launch of his career. Adams, who earned a bachelor's degree in fine arts, exploded out of the blocks and is now one of the country's pre-eminent artists who captures Black culture.\n\n\"I dreamed of doing great work, so it's amazing to live out your dreams,\" he said.\n\nAdams, 62, actually is living a fantasy. Famous people are drawn to his work. Collectors of his art are a who's who of sports and entertainment: Among them are pro basketball Hall of Famers Alonzo Mourning, Ray Allen, Dwyane Wade, Patrick Ewing and Dikembe Mutombo, current NBA stars Chris Paul and Bam Adebayo, actor Wesley Snipes, NFL Hall of Famer and television host Michael Strahan, actress Jasmine Guy and comedian Tracy Morgan. Hollywood star Eddie Murphy, singer Patti LaBelle and former U.S. Ambassador Andrew Young also own Adams' early work.\n\n\"His work captures the essence of Black life,\" said Mourning, who first saw Adams' display at the 1997 NBA All-Star Weekend in Cleveland. \"I just froze and stared at all of it. I ended up buying five pieces, putting them in my house. And over the years I have seen a uniqueness in the character of his work. Given the opportunity and the visibility, he could become the premier ethnic artist in the country.\"\n\nHeritage Fine Arts describes Adams' work as \"dominated by the earth tones favored by Rembrandt and the American artists he admires, giving his work a poetic, pensive quality.\"\n\n\"It's extremely flattering that celebrities - or anyone - support my work,\" said Adams, who ran track in high school and is an avid golfer. \"Usually, my collectors have seen my work on their friends' or colleagues' walls and asked about me. I don't want to sell my art. I want my art to sell itself.\"\n\nAnd so it has.\n\nMourning is the No. 1 collector of Adams' work. Guy, who starred in the legendary television series \"A Different World,\" has been an Adams collector for years and hosted multiple events featuring his work.\n\nGuy sat for a portrait many years ago and was captured by the detail in the finished product. \"And the pose he used was not a pose. It was just me looking out the window, thinking,\" she said. \"It was a brilliant choice by a brilliant artist.\"\n\nAdams' connection to celebrities does not end there. While working on commission as an appliance salesman, he saved a woman hundreds of dollars on equipment and warranties she did not need. He said she reminded him of his mother \"and I just couldn't let her leave knowing she was wasting money.\" About six months later, the woman took the first-ever newspaper article about Adams as an artist to the set of \"The Cosby Show,\" where her son had scored a job as an extra.\n\nThe son shared the article with the show's star, Bill Cosby, who then purchased one of Adams' watercolor pieces sight unseen. Adams said Cosby later called him and urged him to apply to a master's program to refine his skills even further. \"You apply to any art school in the world, get in on your own merits - don't mention me - and I will pay for it,\" he recalls Cosby saying.\n\nAdams was accepted to the University of Pennsylvania, and Cosby paid for his tuition as well as an apartment and a stipend.\n\n\"I know there's controversy around Bill Cosby, but he changed my life,\" Adams said.\n\nThe late poet Maya Angelou had an impact on him, too. She appreciated Adams' work and hosted a showing for him at Howard University and a dinner in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. At the latter event, he recalled saying, \"'Dr. Angelou, I'm searching for that artistic voice.' And she said, 'Young Mr. Adams, you have to go out to the world, soak it up like a sponge, bring it back to your studio and bring it out.' Those words stuck with me.\"\n\nBut how did they influence his work? \"I started traveling with my camera and began photographing everything that moved me,\" he said. \"I started writing stuff down in a book. Her words made me see better.\"\n\nA trip to Ghana in 2019, many years after he received Angelou's advice, inspired him, too. He visited the so-called slave dungeons in Cape Coast, where enslaved Africans were held captive before being herded onto ships bound for the Middle Passage.\n\n\"I literally started vomiting when I came out of the male dungeon,\" Adams said. \"Whenever I think I can't do something, I always think back to that experience. I asked the tour guide, 'How did they survive?' And he simply said, 'They lived so that you can live.' It made me understand that I have so many things I want to say in my work.\"\n\nHe is proudly working on a 15-foot by 60-foot mural in his beloved hometown of Plainfield. And Adams has worked alongside his son Kyle Olani Adams, 23, also an accomplished artist. They teamed up for the exhibit \"Pivot\" last November at Detour Gallery in New York. \"A lot of people say, 'He's better than you with charcoal,' and I say, 'You're damned right. And I'm proud of him.' What I love most about Kyle is that he has a desire to be great. He's driven. He's going to be that guy.\"\n\nKyle Olani, poised and unassuming, said his older brother Jaylen inherited their father's boisterous personality \"and I guess I got the artist side.\" It wasn't until high school, though, that he \"took art seriously.\" Now, after creating consistently during the Covid pandemic, he's on an upward trajectory.\n\n\"I see the potential for greatness in Kyle,\" said Mourning, who has bought his work and placed one of his pieces in the lobby of his recently opened Overtown Youth Center in Miami. \"All he has to do is remain disciplined, diligent and hungry, and good things are going to happen for him - like it did for his dad.\"\n\nFor more from NBC BLK, sign up for our weekly newsletter .\n\nI proudly write intensely and almost exclusively about Black life, culture, issues and people in a way that informs and advances the conversation and provides context to sometimes complex concerns.

To be unapologetic is to remain stoic in the face of judgment. But to me, Coates has always represented something different.\n\nNot so much unapologetic Blackness - the kind that seems deeply concerned, albeit disgusted, with white perceptions of Black people. But, instead, \"unquestionable\" Blackness. The kind that reverses the white gaze and tells people from this privileged group: Now it's your turn under the microscope.\n\nHe's not stoic. He's righteously confrontational.\n\nThat's why I think Coates and his work have been so summarily targeted by conservatives. He's a fierce social critic and - even worse for right-wingers - an extremely creative writer who knows how to write about race and class with frankness and seriousness, and without relying on bigoted assumptions about Black people.\n\nSo today, on Day 3 of \"Black History, Uncensored,\" The ReidOut Blog's monthlong series focusing on creators targeted by GOP book bans, Ta-Nehisi Coates gets the spotlight.\n\nHis 2010 piece in The Atlantic rebutting a New York Times article on the \"culture of poverty\" supposedly afflicting Black people speaks to the reversal of the white gaze I mentioned earlier.\n\nHe wrote:\n\nWhen we talk \"culture,\" as it relates to African-Americans, we assume a kind of exclusivity and suspension of logic. Stats are whipped out (70 percent of black babies born out of wedlock) and then claims are tossed around cavalierly, (black culture doesn't value marriage.) The problem isn't that \"culture\" doesn't exist, nor is it that elements of that \"culture\" might impair upward mobility.\n\nHe continued:\n\nIt defies logic to think that any group, in a generationally entrenched position, would not develop codes and mores for how to survive in that position. African-Americans, themselves, from poor to bourgeois, are the harshest critics of the street mentality. Of course, most white people only pay attention when Bill Cosby or Barack Obama are making that criticism. The problem is that rarely do such critiques ask  why anyone would embrace such values. Moreover, they tend to assume that there's something uniquely \"black\" about those values, and their the embrace.\n\nThe piece pairs well with its 2014 follow-up, \" Black Pathology Crowdsourced ,\" in which Coates explains the vital role that historians played in constructing his 2010 essay, and why historians are essential in debates about culture.\n\nTaken together, the writings are perfect demonstrations of the threat Coates poses to today's conservative movement. He's insatiably curious, and he knows how the history that conservatives want to hide with book bans and curriculum changes is extremely powerful.\n\nCoates appeared on MSNBC's \"All In with Chris Hayes\" on Thursday to discuss recent efforts to ban his work, and the Republican Party's ongoing assault on nonwhite creators. Check it out here:\n\nRead previous \"Black History, Uncensored\" posts on Kimberlé Crenshaw and bell hooks .\n\nJa'han Jones is an MSNBC opinion blogger. He previously wrote The ReidOut Blog.

Heads in cars flip all the way around. Workers in shop windows stop what they're doing to look at me blank faced-as if I'm not their daughter's classmate, their friend's co-worker, like they haven't known me my whole life. \"When I forget the spectacle of myself,\" Diamond wryly notes, \"I look behind me to see who is the me.\" Books in review Swift River By Essie Chambers Buy this book Diamond is 16, biracial, overweight and seemingly in the midst of outgrowing everything familiar-her body, stretch-marked with the weight of racial trauma; her relationship with her loving but grief-numbed mother, Anna; and perhaps most of all, her down-at-the-heels, otherwise all-white hometown, where Diamond's size, skin, and story mark her as a permanent outsider. It is the summer of 1987, seven years after her African American father abruptly and mysteriously vanished, and with him, Diamond's only connection to an extended family whose Blackness reflects her own. Like the figure of \"Pop,\" Blackness is like a specter in Diamond's life, intangible yet omnipresent in its echoing and mystifying absence. More From Kali Holloway The Democrats' Lost Millions April 10, 2025 Why Musk and Trump Really Want to Gut the Government April 1, 2025 White Flops Rejoice! March 12, 2025 Swift River is \"a story about leaving,\" Diamond indicates from the novel's outset, and her desire to get out is indicated by bedroom walls adorned not with images of pop stars or 1980s teen idols, but aspirational destination photos: the pyramids, California's redwood coast, Stonehenge. There are also driving lessons, kept secret from her mother, whose unaddressed mourning manifests as codependency with her daughter. Despite, or perhaps because of, all she has endured, Diamond possesses emotional insights beyond her years-and a wit sharpened by the coarseness of fatphobic insults and racial slights. In one scene, she discovers the word \" NIGER \" has been scrawled next to her family's listing in a public phonebook. Grabbing a pen from her purse, she quickly, cheekily adds a final bit: \"- The third longest river in Africa! \" At its heart, Swift River is about the shedding of secrets-personal, familial, and communal-and concealed truths that Diamond learns have resulted in a transgenerational sense of placelessness, stagnation, and loss. That process begins when Diamond unexpectedly receives a letter from Auntie Lena, a previously unknown paternal relative. Thus begins an exchange that unearths the hidden history of Swift River's once-thriving Black community, a population driven from the town's borders by racist Jim Crow violence, upending Diamond's Black family tree at the roots. In that history, she finds not just a kindredness with bygone ancestors but also the familial legacy that blossomed from so many fractured branches. It's both recognition and reckoning, helping Diamond to locate herself in her past, make sense of her identity in the present, and map the route that lays out her future.

Diamond's family narrative is inextricably tangled in a larger history of race and place in America. The expulsion of entire Black communities from towns like Swift River was not uncommon during the Jim Crow era, a period marked by anti-Black pogroms and white vigilante violence. Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Rosewood, Florida, were all-Black towns leveled by white terror violence, finally acknowledged only in recent years, but there were many more . Equally common were towns like Swift River-all-white \"sundown towns\" where Black people were banned after dark , and faced potentially lethal consequences if they lingered after sunset. According to James Loewen, author of Sundown Towns: A Hidden Dimension of American Racism , some 10,000 sundown towns existed in America well into the 1960s. Chambers says that upon beginning research for Swift River several years ago, she discovered a little-known geographic aspect of sundown towns. Current Issue View our current issue \"I thought I understood what sundown towns were. I had read about them. We've all seen them represented in movies, we know the role the Green Book played because of sundown towns,\" Chambers told me. \"But what I didn't understand, that [Loewen's] book helped me to realize, is that sundown towns were primarily a northern thing-North meaning Midwest and West as well-and formed part of the response to the Great Migration. That's when I started to think about what it would mean for the book if Swift River were a former sundown town.\" Author Essie Chambers, it cannot be stated enough, is not Diamond Newberry; likewise, Swift River is not an autobiography. (Authors of color who write characters of color are all too often assumed to be unimaginatively recounting their own lives.) But like Diamond, Chambers is biracial (Black-identifying), and grew up in a small New England town where she, her siblings, and her father were among the few residents of color. There are as many Black American family stories as there are Black American families, and the details differ in critical ways. But for most Americans of color, there is relatability and resonance in stories of navigating inhospitable white spaces, just as there is in the experience of being the only one . \"When you have to maintain your sense of self, when you have to understand your identity in the absence of Black culture-that, too, is a part of the Black American experience,\" Chambers told me. \"And I've now experienced it in so many different contexts. There's the experience of being born into that situation, and that has its own set of rules. There's the corporate experience of it, where you are often folding yourself in half.\" Those insults can hollow out and diminish, but just as frequently, they can also accrue and amass within us. Chambers noted to me that Diamond's weight, in part, results from having to swallow so many racial microaggressions without response. Most painfully, for Diamond, those come from friends, family members and loved ones whose words inadvertently reveal their own unexamined anti-Blackness. In Swift River , Diamond's white maternal grandmother fails to notice that a tchotchke she brings home is a racist caricature; Diamond's one friend, while earnestly trying to protect her from a bigoted stranger hurling racist slurs at her, offers up a tokenizing defense, telling the stranger that Diamond is \"not like that.\" Chambers says her deftness in depicting those quotidian brushes with anti-Black racism were influenced by Claudia Rankine's book of poetry about encounters with anti-Black racism Citizen: An American Lyric. \"There was something about the way that [Rankine] expressed microaggressions, which was that she showed they so often came from people she loved. I hadn't been thinking about it that way, and that shifted my thinking,\" Chambers told me. \" Swift River wouldn't work if all the white characters were just cartoonishly bad. That wasn't my experience when I was growing up. Yes, maybe if I went for a walk, someone might scream something ugly out of a window. But that wasn't the daily experience of being there. It was much more about having to stay in your body somehow-in your skin-as people you cared about-teachers and friends-said hurtful things, maybe without even understanding that they were hurtful, just to be able to survive that environment and feel like a part of it.\" And perhaps to feel, however fleetingly or superficially, safe. Swift River is the only home Diamond has ever had. Known dangers can seem less threatening than unknown dangers. Diamond's resolve to leave Swift River flags during the moments when she thinks, \" These are my people in so many ways,\" as Chambers puts it. \"At least, until she finds new people.\" In the slowly deteriorating familial home Diamond shares with her Irish American mother, there is a bounty of family heirlooms: \"feathery yellowed papers announcing ancient births and deaths and marriages, antique wedding chests, lacy baptism dresses,\" allowing Diamond to feel like she's \"frolicking with the ancestors.\" Contrast her mother's tangible family tree roots with the rootlessness of her gardening-obsessed father, who to Diamond seems \"as if he sprang from the ground like one of his plants.\" \"I've always felt the gaps in my family tree,\" Chambers, who can trace her mother's side to an ancient King of Scotland, says. \"Especially because I've had these riches on my mother's side, I saw how they helped form her identity and her sense of herself.\" This is a typical African American conundrum, the result of a lack of documentation from the dislocating force of slavery, and a disregard for the humanity and personhood of Black enslaved peoples. But in writing Swift River and as a producer on the highly decorated 2022 film Descendant -director Margaret Brown's documentary about the last known ship to traffick African people into enslavement in the United States, and the living descendants of those onboard-Chambers learned how legacies are passed in so many other ways. \"Someone asked me recently how I learned storytelling, and I realized a lot of it was from watching my father and his brothers tell family stories on the porch,\" Chambers told me. \"That was the thing I learned working on Descendant . Oral history is not a lesser history, especially for people who are not part of the dominant culture. It's essential to tell the stories and pass them down in that way. And so I was part of many of those moments-the passing down of history, without even understanding that was happening. So in that way, I have a very different understanding of history on my dad's side. But it's one that is also very rich.\"\n\nIf I'm on foot, people stare so hard it's like I'm on fire. Heads in cars flip all the way around. Workers in shop windows stop what they're doing to look at me blank faced-as if I'm not their daughter's classmate, their friend's co-worker, like they haven't known me my whole life.\n\n\"When I forget the spectacle of myself,\" Diamond wryly notes, \"I look behind me to see who is the me.\" Books in review Swift River By Essie Chambers Buy this book Diamond is 16, biracial, overweight and seemingly in the midst of outgrowing everything familiar-her body, stretch-marked with the weight of racial trauma; her relationship with her loving but grief-numbed mother, Anna; and perhaps most of all, her down-at-the-heels, otherwise all-white hometown, where Diamond's size, skin, and story mark her as a permanent outsider. It is the summer of 1987, seven years after her African American father abruptly and mysteriously vanished, and with him, Diamond's only connection to an extended family whose Blackness reflects her own. Like the figure of \"Pop,\" Blackness is like a specter in Diamond's life, intangible yet omnipresent in its echoing and mystifying absence.

There are also driving lessons, kept secret from her mother, whose unaddressed mourning manifests as codependency with her daughter. Despite, or perhaps because of, all she has endured, Diamond possesses emotional insights beyond her years-and a wit sharpened by the coarseness of fatphobic insults and racial slights.

That process begins when Diamond unexpectedly receives a letter from Auntie Lena, a previously unknown paternal relative. Thus begins an exchange that unearths the hidden history of Swift River's once-thriving Black community, a population driven from the town's borders by racist Jim Crow violence, upending Diamond's Black family tree at the roots. In that history, she finds not just a kindredness with bygone ancestors but also the familial legacy that blossomed from so many fractured branches. It's both recognition and reckoning, helping Diamond to locate herself in her past, make sense of her identity in the present, and map the route that lays out her future.

But in writing Swift River and as a producer on the highly decorated 2022 film Descendant -director Margaret Brown's documentary about the last known ship to traffick African people into enslavement in the United States, and the living descendants of those onboard-Chambers learned how legacies are passed in so many other ways. \"Someone asked me recently how I learned storytelling, and I realized a lot of it was from watching my father and his brothers tell family stories on the porch,\" Chambers told me. \"That was the thing I learned working on Descendant . Oral history is not a lesser history, especially for people who are not part of the dominant culture. It's essential to tell the stories and pass them down in that way. And so I was part of many of those moments-the passing down of history, without even understanding that was happening. So in that way, I have a very different understanding of history on my dad's side. But it's one that is also very rich.\"\n\nAt its heart, Swift River is about the shedding of secrets-personal, familial, and communal-and concealed truths that Diamond learns have resulted in a transgenerational sense of placelessness, stagnation, and loss. That process begins when Diamond unexpectedly receives a letter from Auntie Lena, a previously unknown paternal relative. Thus begins an exchange that unearths the hidden history of Swift River's once-thriving Black community, a population driven from the town's borders by racist Jim Crow violence, upending Diamond's Black family tree at the roots. In that history, she finds not just a kindredness with bygone ancestors but also the familial legacy that blossomed from so many fractured branches. It's both recognition and reckoning, helping Diamond to locate herself in her past, make sense of her identity in the present, and map the route that lays out her future.

Diamond's family narrative is inextricably tangled in a larger history of race and place in America. The expulsion of entire Black communities from towns like Swift River was not uncommon during the Jim Crow era, a period marked by anti-Black pogroms and white vigilante violence. Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Rosewood, Florida, were all-Black towns leveled by white terror violence, finally acknowledged only in recent years, but there were many more . Equally common were towns like Swift River-all-white \"sundown towns\" where Black people were banned after dark , and faced potentially lethal consequences if they lingered after sunset. According to James Loewen, author of Sundown Towns: A Hidden Dimension of American Racism , some 10,000 sundown towns existed in America well into the 1960s. Chambers says that upon beginning research for Swift River several years ago, she discovered a little-known geographic aspect of sundown towns. Current Issue View our current issue \"I thought I understood what sundown towns were. I had read about them. We've all seen them represented in movies, we know the role the Green Book played because of sundown towns,\" Chambers told me. \"But what I didn't understand, that [Loewen's] book helped me to realize, is that sundown towns were primarily a northern thing-North meaning Midwest and West as well-and formed part of the response to the Great Migration. That's when I started to think about what it would mean for the book if Swift River were a former sundown town.\" Author Essie Chambers, it cannot be stated enough, is not Diamond Newberry; likewise, Swift River is not an autobiography. (Authors of color who write characters of color are all too often assumed to be unimaginatively recounting their own lives.) But like Diamond, Chambers is biracial (Black-identifying), and grew up in a small New England town where she, her siblings, and her father were among the few residents of color. There are as many Black American family stories as there are Black American families, and the details differ in critical ways. But for most Americans of color, there is relatability and resonance in stories of navigating inhospitable white spaces, just as there is in the experience of being the only one . \"When you have to maintain your sense of self, when you have to understand your identity in the absence of Black culture-that, too, is a part of the Black American experience,\" Chambers told me. \"And I've now experienced it in so many different contexts. There's the experience of being born into that situation, and that has its own set of rules. There's the corporate experience of it, where you are often folding yourself in half.\" Those insults can hollow out and diminish, but just as frequently, they can also accrue and amass within us. Chambers noted to me that Diamond's weight, in part, results from having to swallow so many racial microaggressions without response. Most painfully, for Diamond, those come from friends, family members and loved ones whose words inadvertently reveal their own unexamined anti-Blackness. In Swift River , Diamond's white maternal grandmother fails to notice that a tchotchke she brings home is a racist caricature; Diamond's one friend, while earnestly trying to protect her from a bigoted stranger hurling racist slurs at her, offers up a tokenizing defense, telling the stranger that Diamond is \"not like that.\" Chambers says her deftness in depicting those quotidian brushes with anti-Black racism were influenced by Claudia Rankine's book of poetry about encounters with anti-Black racism Citizen: An American Lyric. \"There was something about the way that [Rankine] expressed microaggressions, which was that she showed they so often came from people she loved. I hadn't been thinking about it that way, and that shifted my thinking,\" Chambers told me. \" Swift River wouldn't work if all the white characters were just cartoonishly bad. That wasn't my experience when I was growing up. Yes, maybe if I went for a walk, someone might scream something ugly out of a window. But that wasn't the daily experience of being there. It was much more about having to stay in your body somehow-in your skin-as people you cared about-teachers and friends-said hurtful things, maybe without even understanding that they were hurtful, just to be able to survive that environment and feel like a part of it.\" And perhaps to feel, however fleetingly or superficially, safe.

But it's one that is also very rich.\"\n\n\"There was something about the way that [Rankine] expressed microaggressions, which was that she showed they so often came from people she loved. I hadn't been thinking about it that way, and that shifted my thinking,\" Chambers told me. \" Swift River wouldn't work if all the white characters were just cartoonishly bad. That wasn't my experience when I was growing up. Yes, maybe if I went for a walk, someone might scream something ugly out of a window. But that wasn't the daily experience of being there. It was much more about having to stay in your body somehow-in your skin-as people you cared about-teachers and friends-said hurtful things, maybe without even understanding that they were hurtful, just to be able to survive that environment and feel like a part of it.\" And perhaps to feel, however fleetingly or superficially, safe. Swift River is the only home Diamond has ever had. Known dangers can seem less threatening than unknown dangers. Diamond's resolve to leave Swift River flags during the moments when she thinks, \" These are my people in so many ways,\" as Chambers puts it. \"At least, until she finds new people.\" In the slowly deteriorating familial home Diamond shares with her Irish American mother, there is a bounty of family heirlooms: \"feathery yellowed papers announcing ancient births and deaths and marriages, antique wedding chests, lacy baptism dresses,\" allowing Diamond to feel like she's \"frolicking with the ancestors.\" Contrast her mother's tangible family tree roots with the rootlessness of her gardening-obsessed father, who to Diamond seems \"as if he sprang from the ground like one of his plants.\" \"I've always felt the gaps in my family tree,\" Chambers, who can trace her mother's side to an ancient King of Scotland, says. \"Especially because I've had these riches on my mother's side, I saw how they helped form her identity and her sense of herself.\" This is a typical African American conundrum, the result of a lack of documentation from the dislocating force of slavery, and a disregard for the humanity and personhood of Black enslaved peoples. But in writing Swift River and as a producer on the highly decorated 2022 film Descendant -director Margaret Brown's documentary about the last known ship to traffick African people into enslavement in the United States, and the living descendants of those onboard-Chambers learned how legacies are passed in so many other ways. \"Someone asked me recently how I learned storytelling, and I realized a lot of it was from watching my father and his brothers tell family stories on the porch,\" Chambers told me. \"That was the thing I learned working on Descendant .

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Brooklyn, N.Y., 1980.\n\nThe Nation and Magnum Foundation are partnering on a visual chronicle of untold stories as the coronavirus continues to spread across the United States and the rest of the world- read more from The Invisible Front Line. -The Editors I mages have power. The strongest images have the ability to communicate a message that is more convincing, more believable than any written word. It was images-videos of young Black men being killed by police, by vigilantes-that has motivated so many people to take to the streets in protest these past few weeks. It has been images that are driving so many of the changes these protests are bringing about. I've been making images most of my adult life, and have always been driven by a desire to document Black culture, my culture. I started photographing for my own personal purposes in the 1980s, but as time progressed, and when the crack and AIDS epidemic hit, the image of the Black man and woman in America started to shift, and I wasn't happy with what I saw. I was seeing images that painted the spirit of addiction and mass incarceration, and I realized that I had a responsibility to provide a counternarrative. I believe in balance. I felt it was necessary for me to go out and document the love of family, the mothers and fathers, the children, the hope, and the promise. For me, it was a mission to do that. I was inspired by what W.E.B. Du Bois did in the Paris exposition of 1900-he brought images of Black life to the public, beyond the sensationalism. I wanted to focus on honor and dignity. The Righteous Brothers. Brooklyn, N.Y., 1982. Father's Day. Brooklyn, N.Y., 1997. I started my career as a corrections officer at New York's Rikers Island jail in the 1980s. Every day I went to work and looked in that pen to see who I could pull out, to see who I knew from the community. I always brought newspapers and extra magazines to encourage young men to read. I went to work looking for Malcolm; I went there looking for Mandela. I knew there were a lot of men who were incarcerated and didn't need to be in there. I tried to guide as many young men as I could. House of Pain. Rikers Island, East Elmhurst, Queens, NYC, 1985. One of the ways I used my camera as a tool for Black liberation was by simply recognizing the inner beauty that my subjects possess. In photographing, I always tried to impart knowledge. All my work was really about just reaching the people-photography was secondary. The primary aim was to talk to people about what was going on in America and how we needed to wake up. The camera was the master key that allowed me entry into the hearts and minds of the men and women I photographed. We grew up with a mantra, and it stayed with me for many years, even to this very day: I want for my brothers what I want for myself. I went out there with that passion and a duty. The camera became a compass to help guide me. Remembering a King. Washington, D.C., 1983. I carried two things with me at all times: my camera and my chessboard. I started to teach a lot of young men chess, because chess to me was teaching the science of conflict resolution, decision-making, strategy, and patience. I would say: This is the game of life. If you understand this game-and beyond the physical game, if you understand how it's related to life-it will carry you on through a lot of difficult times. Before you make a choice, you take time to look at your mental chessboard. You analyze it. You look at the sacrifices. You make hard decisions, and you make your move. We Love Our Youth. Harlem, NYC, 1997. And Then Came Crack. Harlem, NYC, 1982. In the 1990s I began working at the 100 Center Street Supreme Court in Manhattan, in the heart of the city. Police brutality was at an all-time high, and protests filled the streets. Giuliani was the mayor. The Rodney King verdict, O.J. Simpson, all these major racial incidents affected me. As a Black man in America, I was always looked upon as a suspect, an enemy of the state. But in my job, I enforced the law. It was a kind of double consciousness. On my lunch breaks I would photograph, feeling a sense of freedom. The 2000s provided me with a great opportunity to meet a number of up-and-coming visionaries and artists. That was the joy and one of the greatest blessings of my books' being published. I had an opportunity to meet a lot of young people who look to me as a mentor for the type of work I've done. Elders like Gordon Parks and James Van Der Zee weren't around, so I was someone in the flesh that had created something that served as a beacon to a lot of young people. I always wanted to be one that was open and available, approachable. No Disrespect. Supreme Court, New York City, 1997. Giuliani Time. New York City, 1997. SHOT IN THE BACK. New York City, 1997. The coronavirus pandemic has changed so much about how we do things in terms of greeting each other, in the handshake, the hug. With that being gone now, I don't know how that's going to impact people on an emotional level, especially during a time of tremendous loss, when a hug serves as a form of reassurance, assurance. And now it's gone. I'm not one to shoot from afar. Most of my photography is rooted in having conversations with people, and now there is an element of apprehension and fear in everyday connections. How are we going to grow as a society when everyone is wearing a mask, when we can no longer interact the way we once did? Fuck the Police. New York City, circa 1995. Hope. Washington, D.C., 2013. Right now, we need all hands on deck to produce a counterbalance to all this negativity in hopes of making not only this country a better place, but the world a better place. We've shown our power in using our cameras to address police brutality. Let's continue to use that same energy to address other issues, and prove that we are truly concerned about injustice at a global scale. We are living in some very troubling times when hatred and division are on the rise, but the youth are in the streets, struggling to bring about long-overdue change. In order to make a better world for our children and loved ones, we must come together as concerned citizens and use our individual platforms to spread messages of empathy and justice for all.

Rikers Island, East Elmhurst, Queens, NYC, 1985.\n\nOne of the ways I used my camera as a tool for Black liberation was by simply recognizing the inner beauty that my subjects possess. In photographing, I always tried to impart knowledge. All my work was really about just reaching the people-photography was secondary. The primary aim was to talk to people about what was going on in America and how we needed to wake up. The camera was the master key that allowed me entry into the hearts and minds of the men and women I photographed. We grew up with a mantra, and it stayed with me for many years, even to this very day: I want for my brothers what I want for myself. I went out there with that passion and a duty. The camera became a compass to help guide me. Remembering a King. Washington, D.C., 1983. I carried two things with me at all times: my camera and my chessboard. I started to teach a lot of young men chess, because chess to me was teaching the science of conflict resolution, decision-making, strategy, and patience. I would say: This is the game of life. If you understand this game-and beyond the physical game, if you understand how it's related to life-it will carry you on through a lot of difficult times.

Activate your online access\n\nThe art of everyday Black experience.\n\nIn Ordinary Notes , Sharpe considers Black culture \"in all of its shade and depth and glow.\"\n\nDays after Tyre Nichols was killed by five Memphis police officers earlier this year, the city's police department released footage of his murder. The videos sparked protests in Tennessee and across the country, demonstrating once again that depictions of state violence and Black death can spur national action and bring bodies into the streets. But seeing this sequence of events play out yet again raises a different question: What about Black life? Can it also spur people into action? Nichols, an amateur photographer of the urban and rural South, would not have wanted his legacy to endure through the lenses of police body cams or local surveillance cameras. His portfolio of photographs includes experiments with color and perspective that revel in the beauty, love, and charm that constitute the Black aesthetic of the everyday. What would happen, what actions would be sparked, if we disseminated these images invested with the vibrancy of Black life and subjectivity as well?\n\nIn her new book, Ordinary Notes , which was a finalist for this year's National Book Award for Nonfiction, Christina Sharpe explores this question without providing any easy answers. A lush enmeshment of photographs and other images with notes on various subjects-some as short as a phrase, others as long as a few pages-the book invites its readers to engage with the multitudes of Black life, to think about and work through them without expecting this engagement to necessarily repair the injustices of the past or the present. Sharpe's brilliant collage of materials probes how \"Black people make a life in beauty and in struggle\" in the face of structural racism and precarity. In close and provocative readings of Toni Morrison's Beloved , Dawoud Bey's black-and-white landscapes, Black Lives Matter protest video stills, Torkwase Dyson's multimedia installations, and other notable public projects, Sharpe considers Black culture \"in all of its shade and depth and glow.\" But she also notes that while the images of everyday Black life are valuable counterweights to the numerous images of everyday Black death that circulate, they too will not be enough to abolish anti-Blackness.\n\nIn many ways, Ordinary Notes extends from Sharpe's previous work, which has showcased how the typical, the commonplace, and much of what has been naturalized as such have contributed to the experience of being Black in the United States today. In Monstrous Intimacies: Making Post-Slavery Subjects , Sharpe-a professor of Black studies at York University in Canada-examined how the sexual and physical violence inflicted on the enslaved continues to haunt the formation of Black subjectivity in the present. With In the Wake , she combined meditations from her own life, analyses of the historical record, and close readings of works of contemporary Black art to consider the kinds of Black lives and aesthetic practices that emerge out of what she calls \"being in [slavery's] wake.\" To live knowing that the effects of slavery persist into the present, Sharpe argues, profoundly affects not just public life but our private lives as well; to study the afterlife of slavery therefore requires an approach to history and culture that looks beyond the formal disciplinary constraints of the academy and into the realm of the felt, the subjunctive, the conjectural. One must turn to poetry as well as to sociology, art as well as economics, culture as well as politics.\n\nAlong the lines of these previous endeavors, Ordinary Notes breaks out of the reductive conventions of academic scholarship in the pursuit of Black study. Just as In the Wake braided together personal biography and critical theory, disclosing how a series of deaths in Sharpe's family deeply affected her and how these lives lost illustrate the extent to which slavery's insistence on Black inferiority continues to guide the modus operandi of various American institutions, Ordinary Notes brings together a variety of media-ephemeral, historical, social, and otherwise-in order to tell a personal and individual story that contributes to and is shaped by a larger structural one.\n\nFor Sharpe, photographs are particularly useful tools for telling these stories. Drawing from photographs in her own personal library as well as those found in various archives, she shows how each picture-especially those featuring Black subjects-always documents a negotiation of power among the people in the photographs, those taking them, and those viewing them. An old photo of the writer's mother and grandmother leaning gently into each other, the former dressed in a Halloween costume made from scratch by the latter, displays a tenderness that would have been lost in the official paperwork, \"those archives that suspend and defer Black life in ways that would make our living tangential to some other living, not ours.\" A well-known photograph of Elizabeth Eckford being harangued by an angry white mob as she desegregates Little Rock Central High School is juxtaposed with a recent image of white nationalists in Charlottesville, Va., chanting anxiously about their replacement. Sometimes Sharpe presents us with pictures that are more opaque-at one point, photos of the condensation and frost on her window panes serve to illustrate how important it is \"to notice or observe with care.\" Each photograph, Sharpe reminds us, gathers so much within it: the depths of intimacy between a mother and a daughter, the racist vitriol that can be found even in a white supremacist's spittle, the calm of routine weather.\n\nIn poring over these images, Sharpe threads a needle between Roland Barthes's ruminations on photography, which insist that the medium is often haunted by a sense of death, and those put forward by, for instance, Frederick Douglass, which argue for the positive political work that photographs can do, especially when it is Black photographers working against the rampant proliferation of anti-Black caricatures. Sharpe does not entirely disagree with Barthes or Douglass, but she does think that neither school of theory accounts well enough for the filters that photographs are viewed and understood through. While Douglass had grandly claimed in a speech titled \"Pictures and Progress\" that photography could help usher in a social advancement for Black Americans that would \"dissolve the granite barriers of arbitrary power, bring the world into peace and unity, and at last crown the world with justice, liberty, and brotherly kindness,\" Sharpe contends that this might place too much faith in the observer's ability to transcend their own negative preconceptions of Black life.\n\nOne example, in fact, is provided in Sharpe's discussion of Barthes's writing. For Barthes, a portrait taken by the African American photographer James Van Der Zee of a Black family in Harlem dressed in formal attire signifies the unfortunate (because it is impossible) desire \"to assume the White Man's attributes,\" a \"spectacle\" that stirs \"almost a kind of tenderness\" within him. But as Sharpe notes, Barthes's reading of the photograph is itself \"a gaze and not a look,\" as it projects the desires of whiteness onto the picture's Black subjects.\n\nWho are photographs for, anyway? More specifically, what purpose do memorials to the victims of slavery and racism-which often employ images of Black suffering-serve, and who are they for? Throughout Ordinary Notes , Sharpe directs our attention to the ways in which we choose to memorialize as well as to the memorializations themselves. Such memorials, she suggests, cannot always \"be\" for everyone, but so few seem to be for Black people. When Sharpe visits the Whitney Plantation, a former plantation site about an hour west of New Orleans that has been restored as a center for education on the history of chattel slavery, the founder of the museum goes out of his way to assure white visitors that none of them were responsible for the atrocities that once occurred there. For Sharpe, such an assurance not only sanctions whatever feelings are aroused in the white guests as they peruse the plantation; it also obscures how much the \"peculiar institution\" continues to echo in the culture, structures, and interpersonal relations that shape our lives today. Bronze sculptures of enslaved children dressed in overalls and work aprons are displayed throughout the plantation, intended to galvanize white visitors into anti-racist action by highlighting the innocence that was lost on that site, even as Black innocence is lost all around us in the here and now, every day. Sharpe knows why the plantation doesn't have any sculptures of Black adults on display: They tend to play a different role in the white imaginary, often forcing white audiences to reckon with \"the culpability, the debt, the entanglements, and the ongoing brutality of slavery's afterlives.\"\n\nSharpe does not restrict her critique to memorials founded and funded by white patrons and institutions : At one point in Ordinary Notes , she narrates her experience at a screening of a short film produced by Claudia Rankine that stitched together recordings of interactions between Black people and the police, many of which depict excessive violence by law enforcement. She then reproduces a letter written by Rachel Zellars, a Black professor who had attended a similar event, that asks and elaborates on a single question that Sharpe directs at Rankine: \"Do you consider the impact your film will have on Black people in the room before you show it?\"\n\nElsewhere in the book, Sharpe describes a visit to the National Memorial for Peace and Justice in Montgomery, Ala., which was created by the Equal Justice Initiative. While she's there, a weeping white woman interrupts Sharpe's walk through a graveyard built to commemorate the thousands of African Americans who had been murdered by lynch mobs. The woman approaches Sharpe with an expression of regret and offers an apology, but Sharpe doesn't respond: \"With her apology, she tries to hand me her sorrow and whatever else she is carrying, to super-add her burden on my own.\"\n\nOften, Sharpe notes, museums, art galleries, and monuments dedicated to the Black experience purport to do a service for Black audiences, but at best it is one limited by the service they also provide for white audiences. Many of these memorials are designed, above all else, to remind those who need reminding of a history that others know all too well. As Sharpe adds, they also usually have another problem: By framing their memorializations as studies of something totally relegated to the past, they offer a model of history that erroneously stresses discontinuity between yesterday and today and misses how much of American history has already repeated itself. Slavery and Jim Crow may have formally ended, but their legacies-mass incarceration, redlining, police brutality, Black maternal mortality rates, environmental racism, and many others-all continue to manifest themselves today. The damage that has been done continues to be done.\n\nPerhaps we will never finish reckoning with our incomplete past and will have to accept that fact. We will never fully know history, much the way we will never fully know one another. At a certain point, a little more than halfway through Ordinary Notes , Sharpe wonders if this unknowability is itself something that history and memorialization should try to preserve. Writing movingly about her mother, Sharpe pauses and expresses an uncertainty about how candid she has been: \"Maybe I ought to return my mother to her own opacity; allow some description to fall away.\"\n\nOrdinary Notes is a large book full of ideas, both ephemeral and enduring; in it, Sharpe offers much piercing analysis but also, in other cases, respects the mysteries of the everyday and the beauty that comes from them. Sometimes the images of Black life should prompt us to action; at other times, they should simply remind us that if we surrender to our own beauty, perhaps we can ride it.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

Host and founder Don Cornelius's adage of \"Love, Peace, and Soul\" resonated for generations, unleashing what Nelson George has called the civil rights movement's secret power: \"Black Joy.\" Yet embedded within the funky rhythms, ethereal harmonies, and Day-Glo body suits was a desire for something more elusive: Black Power. Black music was a potent force in the drive towards civil rights, from the activists that repurposed spirituals and labor songs into protest anthems to groups like Curtis Mayfield and the Impressions urging folk to \"keep on pushing',\" Aretha Franklin demanding \"Respect,\" and James Brown saying it loud about being \"Black and Proud.\" The year of 1971 was a coming out of sorts for politically charged messages in Black music, with Aretha Franklin's Live at Fillmore West , Sly & the Family Stone's There's a Riot Goin' On , and Marvin Gaye's What's Going On all making their debuts. The national broadcast of Soul Train was born in and of this moment. A local version of Soul Train had already launched in August of 1970 in Chicago on WCIU-TV, with sponsorship from the Sears and Roebuck Company. The broadcast featured legendary Chicago vocalist Jerry Butler, as well as Chicago-based groups the Five Stairsteps, riding the waves of their breakthrough hit \"Ooh Child,\" and the Chi-Lites, whose own mainstream breakthrough, \"Have You Seen Her,\" would be a year away. Fellow Chicagoans Syl Johnson (\"Is It Because I'm Black\") and Gene Chandler of \"Duke of Earl\" fame were among the acts who would appear on the program's second episode. This ability to draw on \"local\" talent and the value of the show as a platform for up-and-coming acts would be important to Soul Train 's success. Eventually, an appearance on Soul Train would provide a kind of street cred for Black artists-even those who had achieved national crossover success. Soul Train hit nationally syndicated airwaves in late October of 1971. The first show featured the Honey Cone (\"Want Ads\"), Eddie Kendricks, newly solo after a decade as the co-lead of The Temptations, and Gladys Knight and the Pips. But it was the energy of the teenagers who populated the soundstage introducing the nation to the Get Down, the Hi-Low, and the Breakdown that made the show an immediate hit. In her book Love, Peace and Soul: Behind the Scenes of America's Favorite Dance Show Soul Train , Ericka Blount Danois described it as \"black radio on television.\" More to the point, Soul Train was an electronically mediated version of the chitlin' circuit -the informal networks of theaters, night-clubs, and after-hours joints that sustained Black performers who were denied access to integrated venues prior to the civil rights movement. One of the linchpins of the Black entrepreneurial class, the chitlin' circuit was the closest thing to a national Black culture.

One of the company's ads from that period featured Frederick Douglass chiding a Black teen for his messed-up Afro. Johnson Products was one of the first Black-owned businesses to trade on the American stock exchange, and, as Blount Danois observes, \" Soul Train was able to continue its programming with a level of autonomy that would not have been possible if it had had to rely on a national sponsor that had to cater to Southern affiliates.\" Company cofounder George E. Johnson was emblematic of a generation of so-called self-made Black men that Cornelius took cues from: Berry Gordy at Motown Records, John H. Johnson of Johnson Publishing, Al Bell at Stax Records, and James Brown, the \"hardest-working man\" in show business. These were not men who would necessarily raise a Black Power fist or quote Stokely Carmichael or Angela Davis, but were activists nonetheless, who doubled down on the ideas of Black respectability and Black excellence as counters to the racial stereotypes that circulated widely in American media and popular culture. Cornielius himself was hypersensitive to negative racial stereotypes; in the program's popular word-scramble segment, he wanted to make sure participants actually knew how to spell-even sharing the word beforehand-to guarantee that they wouldn't show up on national television reinforcing ideas of Black illiteracy. Part of Cornelius's success lay in his valuation of Black culture as something desirable to mass audiences-and his devout belief that Black culture should be in the hands of Black people . This valuation wasn't new: Ahmet Ertegun and Leonard and Marshall Chess built musical empires at Atlantic and Chess Records, respectively, largely on the promotion of Black blues and rhythm & blues artists. Current Issue View our current issue Accordingly Soul Train 's breakthrough success soon caught the attention of Dick Clark, the man behind the hugely popular dance show American Bandstand . American Bandstand set the industry standard for teen-based dance programs, and though Clark's platform was important for emerging soul artists in the 1960s to reach white audiences, even Clark knew he couldn't compete with Soul Train . When Cornelius rebuffed Clark's efforts to buy Soul Train , the latter responded with an ill-advised attempt to create his own version: Soul Unlimited . The show lasted only a year, in large part because of a behind-the-scenes campaign, led by music industry pioneer Clarence Avant-aka the \"Black Godfather\"-and the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Whether Soul Unlimited could deliver a product that could compete with Soul Train was beside the point, and apparently beyond Clark's grasp. What resonated for Black viewers were vibrant and authentic expressions of Black culture that were produced for and by Black people. According to Nelson George in his book The Hippest Trip in America: Soul Train and the Evolution of Culture & Style , \"Many in the black community felt that having a black-owned show on television wasn't just cool TV, but an extension of the Civil Rights Movement. The idea that Clark, with whom blacks had always had an uneasy relationship, could kill Soul Train led to threats of an ABC boycott.\" Cornelius viewed Soul Train as a recognizable Black-owned brand that would transcend changing taste and time. But with the advent of music video programs like BET's Video Soul or Ralph McDaniels's independently produced Video Music Box -a show that was largely indebted to the spirit of Soul Train -challenging his show's singular role, Cornelius launched The Soul Train Awards in 1987. As music industry recognition lagged for R&B and rap in the 1980s, Cornelius offered the gravitas of the Soul Train brand to affirm what mattered to his core audience. The show became a litmus test for what young Black audiences valued-and what they didn't, as when Whitney Houston was famously booed during the awards show. Snoop Dogg perhaps best described the enduring power of Soul Train in 1994 when-holding up his Soul Train Award- he quipped on stage , \"I ain't mad I 'cause didn't win no Grammy.... This the Black folk's Grammy.\" Soul Train survived until 2006, though Cornelius relinquished the hosting reins in the early 1990s. When Soul Train finally derailed after 35 years, it did so as the longest first-run syndicated series in American television history-until it was surpassed by Entertainment Tonight in 2016. Nearly 50 years after the local version was launched in Chicago, a new generation was drawn to the series American Soul -a loosely based account of the rise of Cornelius and Soul Train featuring many contemporary artists who leapt at the opportunity to portray iconic figures, like Kelly Rowland appearing as Gladys Knight and Bobby Brown as Rufus Thomas. In an article by the late journalist Greg Tate in 1994, Cornelius suggested that Black culture was \"one of the few things as an American of African descent that you can depend on. It's one of the few things that you can call yours.\" For Black Americans, Cornelius made sure we could always call Soul Train ours.\n\nBlack music was a potent force in the drive towards civil rights, from the activists that repurposed spirituals and labor songs into protest anthems to groups like Curtis Mayfield and the Impressions urging folk to \"keep on pushing',\" Aretha Franklin demanding \"Respect,\" and James Brown saying it loud about being \"Black and Proud.\" The year of 1971 was a coming out of sorts for politically charged messages in Black music, with Aretha Franklin's Live at Fillmore West , Sly & the Family Stone's There's a Riot Goin' On , and Marvin Gaye's What's Going On all making their debuts.

It's one of the few things that you can call yours.\" For Black Americans, Cornelius made sure we could always call Soul Train ours.\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nFeature / James North\n\nElie Mystal\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nFeature / James North\n\nElie Mystal\n\nElie Mystal\n\nKelton Ellis\n\nZito Madu\n\nYohuru Williams and Bryan Shih\n\nThe Chicago Defender noted at the time of its premier that the new dance show \"was one of the most fantastic presentation of a black production and was even better than most well-known TV musicals often seen on Network stations.\" The Defender might have been simply gassing up to a local homeboy, who by then had moved the show's operations to Los Angeles, but aesthetics of presentation was important to Cornelius-and to his primary sponsor, the Black-owned Johnson Products, best-known for the haircare products Ultra Sheen and Afro-Sheen. One of the company's ads from that period featured Frederick Douglass chiding a Black teen for his messed-up Afro. Johnson Products was one of the first Black-owned businesses to trade on the American stock exchange, and, as Blount Danois observes, \" Soul Train was able to continue its programming with a level of autonomy that would not have been possible if it had had to rely on a national sponsor that had to cater to Southern affiliates.\" Company cofounder George E. Johnson was emblematic of a generation of so-called self-made Black men that Cornelius took cues from: Berry Gordy at Motown Records, John H. Johnson of Johnson Publishing, Al Bell at Stax Records, and James Brown, the \"hardest-working man\" in show business. These were not men who would necessarily raise a Black Power fist or quote Stokely Carmichael or Angela Davis, but were activists nonetheless, who doubled down on the ideas of Black respectability and Black excellence as counters to the racial stereotypes that circulated widely in American media and popular culture. Cornielius himself was hypersensitive to negative racial stereotypes; in the program's popular word-scramble segment, he wanted to make sure participants actually knew how to spell-even sharing the word beforehand-to guarantee that they wouldn't show up on national television reinforcing ideas of Black illiteracy. Part of Cornelius's success lay in his valuation of Black culture as something desirable to mass audiences-and his devout belief that Black culture should be in the hands of Black people . This valuation wasn't new: Ahmet Ertegun and Leonard and Marshall Chess built musical empires at Atlantic and Chess Records, respectively, largely on the promotion of Black blues and rhythm & blues artists.

When Cornelius rebuffed Clark's efforts to buy Soul Train , the latter responded with an ill-advised attempt to create his own version: Soul Unlimited . The show lasted only a year, in large part because of a behind-the-scenes campaign, led by music industry pioneer Clarence Avant-aka the \"Black Godfather\"-and the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Whether Soul Unlimited could deliver a product that could compete with Soul Train was beside the point, and apparently beyond Clark's grasp. What resonated for Black viewers were vibrant and authentic expressions of Black culture that were produced for and by Black people. According to Nelson George in his book The Hippest Trip in America: Soul Train and the Evolution of Culture & Style , \"Many in the black community felt that having a black-owned show on television wasn't just cool TV, but an extension of the Civil Rights Movement. The idea that Clark, with whom blacks had always had an uneasy relationship, could kill Soul Train led to threats of an ABC boycott.\" Cornelius viewed Soul Train as a recognizable Black-owned brand that would transcend changing taste and time. But with the advent of music video programs like BET's Video Soul or Ralph McDaniels's independently produced Video Music Box -a show that was largely indebted to the spirit of Soul Train -challenging his show's singular role, Cornelius launched The Soul Train Awards in 1987.

The show became a litmus test for what young Black audiences valued-and what they didn't, as when Whitney Houston was famously booed during the awards show.

(Jim Alexander / Courtesy of the Auburn Avenue Research Library on African American Culture and History)\n\nIn the 1960s, the Free Southern Theater, an organization founded by a group of activists with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), traveled to a church in a predominantly Black, rural corner of Mississippi. There they staged Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot , an absurdist drama about characters conversing as they wait for someone who never arrives. The play may have seemed like a strange choice-who would imagine that Beckett might connect with rural Black Americans in the throes of the civil rights movement?-but it found at least one admirer in civil rights leader Fannie Lou Hamer. \"I guess we know something about waiting, don't we?\" Hamer said from the audience. 1 Books in Review Behold the Land: The Black Arts Movement in the South By James Smethurst Buy this book Everyone agreed, and as they discussed the play, the conversation eventually turned to slavery and prisons. \"We had this incredible discussion with people who barely had a sixth-grade education,\" Denise Nicholas, an actress in the Free Southern Theater, said later. And drama-even high-modernist, experimental drama-functioned as political education. 2 This was the Free Southern Theater's goal. As cofounder John O'Neal recalled of its creation: 3 We claimed to be playwrights and poets; yet the political facts of life presented by the situation we first learned of in the South called for a life of useful (political or economic) engagement. How could we remain true to ourselves and our own concerns as artists and at the same time remain true to our developing recognition of political responsibility? 4 Their answer was a theater group that aimed, as another cofounder, Doris Derby, put it, \"to take the plays out to the rural areas, go around and perform out in the cotton fields or in the churches.\" They did so out of the belief that, as Nicholas later explained, \"the theater, the images, the language, the physicality of it would open doors in people's minds that they didn't necessarily need to read a lot of books to get to.\" For the Free Southern Theater's members, bringing the stage to the countryside made political education accessible while enabling artists to participate in politics. 5 As James Smethurst chronicles in Behold the Land: The Black Arts Movement in the South , the Free Southern Theater was just one of a number of institutions that sought to marry art with local Black Power politics in the South. In a sweeping history of arts institutions from the 1930s to the '80s, the book tells the story of how the turn to Black Power politics in the '60s produced a corollary Black Arts Movement that was especially long-lasting in the South. The Black Power and Black Arts movements, in Smethurst's account, were \"so twinned and joined at the hip that it is impossible, really, to tell where one begins and the other ends.\" While Black Power generally aimed to develop Black autonomy rather than gain inclusion in American society, the Black Arts Movement sought to produce a culture that valued Black people and used cultural forms like theater to encourage their entry into Black Power politics. 6 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion How a Human Rights Lawyer Went From Hero to House Arrest How a Human Rights Lawyer Went From Hero to House Arrest Feature / James North This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion How a Human Rights Lawyer Went From Hero to House Arrest How a Human Rights Lawyer Went From Hero to House Arrest Feature / James North This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal How the Free Southern Theater and other Southern Black Arts Movement institutions were funded is central to Smethurst's story. As he notes, among the enduring successes of the Black Power movement in the South were its electoral victories, which allowed politicians like Maynard Jackson, the first Black mayor of Atlanta, to allocate funding to Black arts institutions. \"The movement in the South,\" Smethurst writes, \"saw some of the most intense publicly supported institutionalization of African American art and culture of anywhere in the country.\" Financing these institutions enabled them to outlast not only the Black Arts Movement's greatest period of success in Northern cities like New York but also the early stages of post-civil-rights Southern conservatism. Their longevity ensured that these institutions continued to provide essential services and arts instruction to Black communities. In his careful attention to this history, Smethurst reminds readers that building solid institutions can provide a means of outlasting the backlash that inevitably follows radical progress. 7 Current Issue View our current issue S methurst's history begins with Marcus Garvey's early-20th-century Black nationalism and the Black communism of the 1930s, which together, he argues, laid the groundwork for the civil rights, Black Power, and Black Arts movements. In the 1910s and '20s, Garvey pushed for the creation of a nation in Africa to which all the descendants of enslaved people could repatriate. His biggest organization was the Universal Negro Improvement Association, which likely reached millions of people at its height in the early 20th century. While Garvey was largely based in New York City, the association was especially prominent in the South: In Miami the UNIA organized self-defense, and in New Orleans it supported labor organizing and a clinic providing health care to Black people. It also sponsored a jazz band, foreshadowing the twinned emphasis of later Black nationalists on material change and cultural production. 8 Garveyism declined in the late 1920s, after Garvey's 1927 deportation to Jamaica. In its wake, many UNIA members flocked to the Communist Party, which became increasingly prominent in Black politics, especially in the South, where the struggle against the Depression and segregation attracted many new members to the party and its subsidiary organizations. Art as well as labor politics were central sites for Black and white Communists organizing in the South. 9 Eventually headquartered in Birmingham, Ala., a Communist Party stronghold, the Southern Negro Youth Congress was founded in 1937 both to pursue revolutionary change and to promote Black art. The SNYC's Puppet Caravan Theatre performed plays about labor and voting rights for Southern farmworkers. It also provided political experience for activists like Ernest Wright, who helped lead the People's Defense League in New Orleans, which marched for jobs and the right to vote and against police brutality. 10 Elsewhere in New Orleans, the Dillard History Unit, founded in 1936 and funded by the Federal Writers' Project, employed the novelist Margaret Walker and contributed to the history The Negro in Louisiana . And in Atlanta in 1942, the visual artist and professor Hale Woodruff joined W.E.B. Du Bois at Atlanta University's People's School in creating a program to educate local adults. In these and other organizations, Smethurst writes, the cross-organizational politics rooted in the Communist Party \"became the most viable space for building radical African American institutions with a bent toward Black self-determination in most of the South.\" 11 McCarthyism and the Second Red Scare resulted in the persecution of leftists in the early postwar years, but many of these Black cultural workers continued to be active in their communities. In 1941, John Biggers enrolled at the Hampton Institute in Virginia, where he was taught by Elizabeth Catlett, who had worked with the Dillard History Unit. In 1949, Biggers joined Texas Southern University, one of the nation's historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), as head of the art department, where he pushed students and instructors to interact with local Black communities. In the 1950s, he began painting murals in poor Black areas in Houston. Biggers was not alone in his persistence: Organizers like Anne and Carl Braden in Kentucky and writers like Sterling Brown in Washington, D.C., continued the project of keeping radical ideas and Black organizing alive in a time of segregation and anti-communist repression. 12 The Black radicalism that informed the Communist Party and many of its subsidiary groups in the South also provided an impetus for Black activism in an era in which the civil rights movement was heating up. In 1949, the demise of the SNYC led several members, including Esther Cooper Jackson, to move north to work for Paul Robeson's Black Marxist newspaper Freedom (where a young Lorraine Hansberry also worked). In 1955, Freedom succumbed to a lack of funding, in part because potential donors feared FBI harassment (and rightfully so, since the bureau was known to have photographed the license plates of those who attended Robeson's concerts). But in 1961, Jackson and other former SNYC leaders started the journal Freedomways , which repurposed 1930s radicalism and socialism for the ascendant civil rights movement. Freedomways published older Black radicals like Shirley Graham Du Bois, rising stars like Audre Lorde, and Black nationalists like Sonia Sanchez. In Smethurst's words, Freedomways \"served as a model of what a radical Black political and cultural journal that embodied the principle of self-determination might be...and practically supported the work and institutions of younger Black artists and intellectuals.\" In so doing, Freedomways created a bridge between different generations of the South's Black left and helped to lay the foundations for a new era of social activism and radical arts. 13 T he South proved to be an especially fertile ground from which civil rights organizers were able to harvest the fruit of seeds sown by past radical movements. In the 1960s, the region was home to about half of all Black Americans living in the United States. It hosted a large consortium of HBCUs, which provided shelter for teachers who might have fallen victim to anti-communism at other institutions. And the South provided a home base for SNCC, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and many of the other best-known civil rights groups and organizers. \"By the early 1960s,\" Smethurst writes, \"the South was the terrain of the most vibrant and diverse grassroots Black political activity in the United States, ranging from direct action nonviolent protest to actual armed self-defense.\" 14 Amid the tumult of the civil rights movement, Black artists sought out new means of making their work relevant to Black politics. In 1964, two members of SNCC's literacy project and a journalist employed by the Mississippi Free Press put their interest in theater to good use by forming the Free Southern Theater. Conceived as a cultural wing of SNCC, the group offered a writing workshop and staged drama for Black Southerners out of its base at Tougaloo College, until police harassment forced it to move to New Orleans. Though rehearsed, the Free Southern Theater's productions required improvisation because Black Southerners often interacted with the performers, including on one occasion when an audience member stood onstage for much of the play. One cofounder, John O'Neal, encouraged as much when he told the audience, \"You are the actors.\" The theater group may have read the lines and provided the set, but poor Black Southerners were the actual protagonists, and their lives were the central dramatic arc. 15 Like many radical Black organizations in the mid-1960s, the Free Southern Theater eventually moved past the integrationist politics of the early civil rights movement and began to concentrate on developing Black culture. This focus on cultural nationalism was occasioned in part by the arrival in 1965 of Tom Dent, a New Orleans native who had left the South for New York. In his time in the North, Dent had participated in Black cultural and political organizations whose members included Maya Angelou, Ishmael Reed, Amiri Baraka, Harold Cruse, and Archie Shepp. But Dent had grown frustrated with the factionalism of many Black Power and Black Arts Movement activists in New York and decided to return to the Big Easy to help bring their ideas (but not their infighting) home. Once there, Dent soon fell in with the Free Southern Theater, and through his extensive contacts the group garnered new financial, personal, and institutional support. The following year, Dent became chairman of the theater's board and facilitated its move from \"an integrated civil rights institution,\" Smethurst writes, \"to a more self-consciously Black theater with a strong nationalist bent.\" This change meant the departure of the group's white members, but it also provided new possibilities. Under Dent, the Free Southern Theater transitioned \"from civil rights to Black Arts, from Negro to Black, from serving the folk of the Black South to being emphatically southern in a Black modality.\" 16 Organizations across the South followed a similar trajectory. At Howard University in Washington, D.C., the poet Sterling Brown mentored students who became key organizers in SNCC as well as those who became noted Black Power activists, including Stokely Carmichael, and Black Arts Movement writers, such as Baraka and Toni Morrison. Off campus, the poet Gaston Neal used War on Poverty funds to establish the Cardozo Area Arts Committee, which in 1965 started the New School of Afro-American Thought, an education and cultural center that taught literature courses to nearby residents. Its opening event featured Black artists ranging from the Harlem Renaissance to the Black Arts Movement, from Brown to Baraka. In the following years, it hosted many important jazz musicians, including Sun Ra's Arkestra and Joseph Jarman. At another HBCU, Nashville's Fisk University, in 1966, the novelist John Oliver Killens organized the Black Writers Conference. Though Baraka was not among the participants, \"the new militant nationalist writing was a specter haunting the conference,\" Smethurst notes. In time, that specter made itself felt. 17 I n the late 1960s and the early '70s, Black Power radicals and artists opened new institutions and transformed older ones to marry the arts and politics. At the 1967 Black Writers Conference at Fisk, Baraka dominated the proceedings, while several older Black writers, including Gwendolyn Brooks, championed the Black Power and Black Arts movements. That same year, one of Brown's mentees, Charlie Cobb, visited the pan-African Parisian bookstore Présence Africaine, which inspired him to create a Black nationalist bookstore, Drum and Spear, in D.C. with other SNCC alumni in 1968. Another of Brown's mentees, A.B. Spellman, moved from New York to Atlanta, where he joined Morehouse professor Stephen Henderson and the historian Vincent Harding in forming what would become the first Black think tank, the Institute of the Black World, which they founded in 1969. And though the Free Southern Theater stopped its tours that year, in part because of diminished funding, its mission of spreading Black culture and inspiring Black people to create their own cultural institutions was sweeping the South. 18 The assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 and the Black uprisings across the nation that followed pushed these organizers to reconsider the relationship between their institutions and local Black communities. At the newly founded Drum and Spear, Cobb and others hosted political meetings, classes, and readings, including poetry by Gaston Neal. Drum and Spear Press also reprinted C.L.R. James's 1938 A History of Pan-African Revolt and a translated collection of Palestinian poetry, Enemy of the Sun . Elsewhere in the city, James Garrett, whose family had a history of radical organizing and who had helped found the Black studies program at San Francisco State, began running the Black studies department at the newly opened Federal City College. There, he hired Cobb and other SNCC alumni involved with Drum and Spear. As Cobb recalled: 19 The question of black education turned on the question or issue of what you were going to do with your education once you finished.... The question you had to confront as a college student was, \"Upon graduation, how am I going to use my education for the black community?\" 20 Email This pedagogical philosophy reoriented many disciplines, from science to literature, toward practical means of serving Black people. Though clashes with administrators led Garrett and others to leave Federal City College and establish a community school, the Center for Black Education, their new approach to the academy influenced other institutions. 21 Where D.C. became a hub for rethinking Black education, New Orleans served as a locus for rethinking Black art. In 1968, the Tulane Drama Review , edited by onetime Free Southern Theater member Richard Schechner, published its landmark \"Black Theatre\" issue. Among the offerings was Larry Neal's foundational essay \"The Black Arts Movement,\" which described the movement's ongoing efforts as the cultural wing of Black Power. If the Black Arts Movement sought to create culture that aided autonomous political efforts, as Neal suggested, the Free Southern Theater put that theory into practice. At the time, its theater troupe formally separated from the group's writers' workshop, BLKARTSOUTH, then under the leadership of Dent and Kalamu ya Salaam. \"For Black theater to have viability in our communities we must have a working tie to those communities,\" Dent wrote of the group's mission, \"something more than the mere performance of plays now and then.\" Consequently, BLKARTSOUTH was composed entirely of New Orleanians, presented their original work, and primarily cast residents as actors. By valorizing the workshop over the production, BLKARTSOUTH embodied a defining trait of the Black Arts Movement: It valued \"process over product.\" 22 Groups across the South likewise experimented with creating new institutions to develop Black culture and political thought. In 1969, the Institute for the Black World began running seminars in Atlanta. \"We were trying to put forward the idea,\" Vincent Harding later recalled, \"that Black scholarship and Black activism were not meant to be separated...and that all of that should be permeated by the arts as well.\" Members of Duke University's Afro-American Association followed through on Harding's goals in Raleigh-Durham, when protests on campus led them to found Malcolm X Liberation University, which aimed to provide an alternative education for Durham's Black residents, including Duke students seeking refuge from a violent campus. And in Nashville in 1970, HBCU faculty and staff founded People's College to teach political and cultural analysis in ways that applied to everyday life. They did so because they saw educating Black people and creating a unique Black culture as essential to building Black nationalism. 23 As the Black Power and Black Arts movements progressed across the South, they increasingly directed their energy toward electoral campaigns as well as the arts and education. In his 1970 \"Coordinator's Statement,\" delivered at the founding convention of the Congress of Afrikan Peoples in Atlanta, Baraka emphasized the importance of voter registration and mobilizing the Black vote. Art played a key part in that effort, with singers like Stevie Wonder, James Brown, and Isaac Hayes supporting Kenneth Gibson's successful 1970 mayoral campaign in Newark. And these electoral victories, as Smethurst notes, also helped the Black Arts Movement by giving \"Black people the administration of political apparatuses with significant control over material resources not before available to Black Power and Black Arts groups.\" 24 Perhaps nowhere was the importance of electoral victories to bolster the Black Arts Movement more on display than in Atlanta. Following his election in 1973, the city's \"culture mayor,\" Maynard Jackson, pledged better funding for the arts. His former speechwriter Michael Lomax led that effort: In 1974 he, the poet Ebon Dooley, and another Jackson campaign staffer and writer, Pearl Cleage, founded the Neighborhood Arts Center, which provided arts education and hosted theater groups in a working-class Black neighborhood. Lomax also helped the writer Toni Cade Bambara secure a position as a writer in residence at Spelman College, another HBCU. In 1975 Jackson appointed Lomax as director of cultural affairs, a position through which he continued financing Black Arts Movement institutions; and in 1978 Bambara, Dooley, and Alice Lovelace founded the Southern Collective of African American Writers, which the Neighborhood Arts Center hosted. In 1979 Lomax helped establish the Fulton County Arts Council, which funded Black Arts Movement organizations throughout the county. By gaining control of the government's spending power through the vote, politicians like Lomax and Jackson, and artists like Bambara and Dooley, developed Atlanta into a hub for radical Black culture. 25 Regional collaborations bolstered these efforts. As the Free Southern Theater and BLKARTSOUTH unraveled in the early 1970s, Dent turned his attention to arts organizations in the South more broadly. He had \"a great dissatisfaction,\" he later recalled, \"with the situation in the early '70s, because I knew that what they were doing in New York was about on the same level with us, but we just didn't have any money.\" Hoping to gain greater recognition and funding, Dent founded the Southern Black Cultural Alliance, which held yearly business meetings at which various organizations could learn from one another how to solve their problems. The alliance also held a yearly conference that brought Black theater troupes and artists across the South to perform. Dent, Salaam, and others then wrote about the conference for a variety of magazines-most notably Hoyt Fuller's Atlanta-based First World , which replaced Black World -as a means of garnering new exposure for their work. By helping artists across the South, the Southern Black Cultural Alliance aided many Black Arts Movement groups in surviving difficult times. 26 Unfortunately, many of these organizations, in Atlanta and in the South more generally, faltered as the federal government scaled back its local funding in the 1980s. In the same year that Ronald Reagan was elected, First World published its final issue. In 1981, when Lomax became chair of the Fulton County Arts Council, the federal government defunded the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act, which had supported many local arts organizations; its 1982 replacement, the Job Placement Training Act, funded far fewer theaters than CETA had. The Reagan administration also provided fewer community block grants, while increasingly conservative Southern state legislatures slashed the funding for Black Arts organizations. Though some managed to persevere, many others had to change their political mission to survive. But as Smethurst reminds his readers, these organizations would have shut down much earlier had they been in other regions; their difficulties in the 1980s after surviving many other conservative turns was less a mark of failure than it was a sign of success. 27 I n Behold the Land , Smethurst demonstrates that decades of organizing and institution building, from the Garveyite years and the Popular Front to the civil rights movement, helped preserve a Black radicalism in the South that eventually became central to the Black Arts Movement in the region. This radicalism was passed on both directly, as when SNYC members published Black Arts writers in Freedomways , and indirectly, as when the Southern Black Cultural Alliance provided a forum for Black Arts Movement workers to collaborate. But in all cases, the Black Arts and Black Power movements were driven by the goal \"to build a new culture of Black cooperation and self-determination.\" Doing so through the arts had the potential to reorient Black political relations toward a collective building of Black autonomy. \"The great strength of Black Arts, its grassroots character, makes it hard to grasp,\" Smethurst observes. \"Black Arts activities and institutions appeared in almost every community and on every campus where there was an appreciable number of Black people.\" By following some of the lines of Black Arts networks, Smethurst gestures toward the broader collaborative endeavors that enabled the movement to gain a foothold in the South and persevere through periods of conservatism. 28 Through interviews conducted with its surviving participants as well as archival research, Smethurst joins scholars like GerShun Avilez and Carter Mathes in revising the canonical understanding of the Black Arts Movement. Where Margo Crawford has argued, in Black Post-Blackness , that the movement foreshadowed contemporary Black artists in their complication of the meanings of Blackness, Smethurst demonstrates that one way that the Black Arts Movement did so was by building institutions that shaped, if not the contemporary artists directly, then the consumers of the art they produce, the venues in which they produce it, and the communities in which they grew up. This aesthetic legacy also bred a political one: The Black Arts Movement laid the foundation for contemporary community arts organizations, for the use of Black art in electoral campaigns, and for arts education as a Black radical, political practice. Though many Black Power organizations eventually folded, the Black Arts Movement helped spread and institutionalize their ideas. 29 This afterlife is especially clear in the long-lasting reach of Southern Black feminism. While scholars like Mary Helen Washington and activists like Mariame Kaba have worked to recover the often neglected history and legacy of midcentury Black radical feminists, Smethurst's account also reminds us of the role of those and other Popular Front radicals in the formation of the Black Arts Movement, especially in the South. Among the SNYC leaders that Smethurst discusses, for instance, was one Alabaman, Sallye Davis. While she worked as a national officer for the SNYC, she was also raising her daughter, Angela, in the intellectual and physical presence of Communist Party members. This early exposure to Marxism, one imagines, influenced not only Angela Davis's great Black Power autobiography, edited by Toni Morrison and published in 1974, but also her intellectual production and anti-carceral radicalism today. 30 In a similar fashion, the legacy of many Southern Black Arts Movement organizations lives on in the present. As Smethurst argues, they helped \"build new African American cultural institutions in historic African American communities that one finds throughout the South today, and the desire to construct networks between these institutions.\" This institutional and coalitional approach ensured that the unraveling of specific institutions did not mark the end of the Black Arts story. If, as Fannie Lou Hamer observed after viewing the Free Southern Theater's production of Waiting for Godot , Black people know something about waiting, they also know something about the long campaign. Liberation may not come tomorrow, but building institutions might mean that freedom can be achieved in the future. 31\n\nBy James Smethurst\n\nBuy this book\n\nEveryone agreed, and as they discussed the play, the conversation eventually turned to slavery and prisons. \"We had this incredible discussion with people who barely had a sixth-grade education,\" Denise Nicholas, an actress in the Free Southern Theater, said later. And drama-even high-modernist, experimental drama-functioned as political education. 2 This was the Free Southern Theater's goal. As cofounder John O'Neal recalled of its creation: 3 We claimed to be playwrights and poets; yet the political facts of life presented by the situation we first learned of in the South called for a life of useful (political or economic) engagement. How could we remain true to ourselves and our own concerns as artists and at the same time remain true to our developing recognition of political responsibility? 4 Their answer was a theater group that aimed, as another cofounder, Doris Derby, put it, \"to take the plays out to the rural areas, go around and perform out in the cotton fields or in the churches.\" They did so out of the belief that, as Nicholas later explained, \"the theater, the images, the language, the physicality of it would open doors in people's minds that they didn't necessarily need to read a lot of books to get to.\" For the Free Southern Theater's members, bringing the stage to the countryside made political education accessible while enabling artists to participate in politics. 5 As James Smethurst chronicles in Behold the Land: The Black Arts Movement in the South , the Free Southern Theater was just one of a number of institutions that sought to marry art with local Black Power politics in the South. In a sweeping history of arts institutions from the 1930s to the '80s, the book tells the story of how the turn to Black Power politics in the '60s produced a corollary Black Arts Movement that was especially long-lasting in the South. The Black Power and Black Arts movements, in Smethurst's account, were \"so twinned and joined at the hip that it is impossible, really, to tell where one begins and the other ends.\" While Black Power generally aimed to develop Black autonomy rather than gain inclusion in American society, the Black Arts Movement sought to produce a culture that valued Black people and used cultural forms like theater to encourage their entry into Black Power politics. 6 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion How a Human Rights Lawyer Went From Hero to House Arrest How a Human Rights Lawyer Went From Hero to House Arrest Feature / James North This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion How a Human Rights Lawyer Went From Hero to House Arrest How a Human Rights Lawyer Went From Hero to House Arrest Feature / James North This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal How the Free Southern Theater and other Southern Black Arts Movement institutions were funded is central to Smethurst's story. As he notes, among the enduring successes of the Black Power movement in the South were its electoral victories, which allowed politicians like Maynard Jackson, the first Black mayor of Atlanta, to allocate funding to Black arts institutions. \"The movement in the South,\" Smethurst writes, \"saw some of the most intense publicly supported institutionalization of African American art and culture of anywhere in the country.\" Financing these institutions enabled them to outlast not only the Black Arts Movement's greatest period of success in Northern cities like New York but also the early stages of post-civil-rights Southern conservatism. Their longevity ensured that these institutions continued to provide essential services and arts instruction to Black communities. In his careful attention to this history, Smethurst reminds readers that building solid institutions can provide a means of outlasting the backlash that inevitably follows radical progress. 7 Current Issue View our current issue S methurst's history begins with Marcus Garvey's early-20th-century Black nationalism and the Black communism of the 1930s, which together, he argues, laid the groundwork for the civil rights, Black Power, and Black Arts movements. In the 1910s and '20s, Garvey pushed for the creation of a nation in Africa to which all the descendants of enslaved people could repatriate. His biggest organization was the Universal Negro Improvement Association, which likely reached millions of people at its height in the early 20th century. While Garvey was largely based in New York City, the association was especially prominent in the South: In Miami the UNIA organized self-defense, and in New Orleans it supported labor organizing and a clinic providing health care to Black people. It also sponsored a jazz band, foreshadowing the twinned emphasis of later Black nationalists on material change and cultural production. 8 Garveyism declined in the late 1920s, after Garvey's 1927 deportation to Jamaica. In its wake, many UNIA members flocked to the Communist Party, which became increasingly prominent in Black politics, especially in the South, where the struggle against the Depression and segregation attracted many new members to the party and its subsidiary organizations. Art as well as labor politics were central sites for Black and white Communists organizing in the South. 9 Eventually headquartered in Birmingham, Ala., a Communist Party stronghold, the Southern Negro Youth Congress was founded in 1937 both to pursue revolutionary change and to promote Black art. The SNYC's Puppet Caravan Theatre performed plays about labor and voting rights for Southern farmworkers. It also provided political experience for activists like Ernest Wright, who helped lead the People's Defense League in New Orleans, which marched for jobs and the right to vote and against police brutality. 10 Elsewhere in New Orleans, the Dillard History Unit, founded in 1936 and funded by the Federal Writers' Project, employed the novelist Margaret Walker and contributed to the history The Negro in Louisiana . And in Atlanta in 1942, the visual artist and professor Hale Woodruff joined W.E.B. Du Bois at Atlanta University's People's School in creating a program to educate local adults. In these and other organizations, Smethurst writes, the cross-organizational politics rooted in the Communist Party \"became the most viable space for building radical African American institutions with a bent toward Black self-determination in most of the South.\" 11 McCarthyism and the Second Red Scare resulted in the persecution of leftists in the early postwar years, but many of these Black cultural workers continued to be active in their communities. In 1941, John Biggers enrolled at the Hampton Institute in Virginia, where he was taught by Elizabeth Catlett, who had worked with the Dillard History Unit. In 1949, Biggers joined Texas Southern University, one of the nation's historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), as head of the art department, where he pushed students and instructors to interact with local Black communities. In the 1950s, he began painting murals in poor Black areas in Houston. Biggers was not alone in his persistence: Organizers like Anne and Carl Braden in Kentucky and writers like Sterling Brown in Washington, D.C., continued the project of keeping radical ideas and Black organizing alive in a time of segregation and anti-communist repression. 12 The Black radicalism that informed the Communist Party and many of its subsidiary groups in the South also provided an impetus for Black activism in an era in which the civil rights movement was heating up. In 1949, the demise of the SNYC led several members, including Esther Cooper Jackson, to move north to work for Paul Robeson's Black Marxist newspaper Freedom (where a young Lorraine Hansberry also worked). In 1955, Freedom succumbed to a lack of funding, in part because potential donors feared FBI harassment (and rightfully so, since the bureau was known to have photographed the license plates of those who attended Robeson's concerts). But in 1961, Jackson and other former SNYC leaders started the journal Freedomways , which repurposed 1930s radicalism and socialism for the ascendant civil rights movement. Freedomways published older Black radicals like Shirley Graham Du Bois, rising stars like Audre Lorde, and Black nationalists like Sonia Sanchez. In Smethurst's words, Freedomways \"served as a model of what a radical Black political and cultural journal that embodied the principle of self-determination might be...and practically supported the work and institutions of younger Black artists and intellectuals.\" In so doing, Freedomways created a bridge between different generations of the South's Black left and helped to lay the foundations for a new era of social activism and radical arts. 13 T he South proved to be an especially fertile ground from which civil rights organizers were able to harvest the fruit of seeds sown by past radical movements. In the 1960s, the region was home to about half of all Black Americans living in the United States.

And the South provided a home base for SNCC, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and many of the other best-known civil rights groups and organizers. \"By the early 1960s,\" Smethurst writes, \"the South was the terrain of the most vibrant and diverse grassroots Black political activity in the United States, ranging from direct action nonviolent protest to actual armed self-defense.\" 14 Amid the tumult of the civil rights movement, Black artists sought out new means of making their work relevant to Black politics.

By gaining control of the government's spending power through the vote, politicians like Lomax and Jackson, and artists like Bambara and Dooley, developed Atlanta into a hub for radical Black culture. 25 Regional collaborations bolstered these efforts. As the Free Southern Theater and BLKARTSOUTH unraveled in the early 1970s, Dent turned his attention to arts organizations in the South more broadly. He had \"a great dissatisfaction,\" he later recalled, \"with the situation in the early '70s, because I knew that what they were doing in New York was about on the same level with us, but we just didn't have any money.\" Hoping to gain greater recognition and funding, Dent founded the Southern Black Cultural Alliance, which held yearly business meetings at which various organizations could learn from one another how to solve their problems. The alliance also held a yearly conference that brought Black theater troupes and artists across the South to perform. Dent, Salaam, and others then wrote about the conference for a variety of magazines-most notably Hoyt Fuller's Atlanta-based First World , which replaced Black World -as a means of garnering new exposure for their work. By helping artists across the South, the Southern Black Cultural Alliance aided many Black Arts Movement groups in surviving difficult times. 26 Unfortunately, many of these organizations, in Atlanta and in the South more generally, faltered as the federal government scaled back its local funding in the 1980s. In the same year that Ronald Reagan was elected, First World published its final issue. In 1981, when Lomax became chair of the Fulton County Arts Council, the federal government defunded the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act, which had supported many local arts organizations; its 1982 replacement, the Job Placement Training Act, funded far fewer theaters than CETA had. The Reagan administration also provided fewer community block grants, while increasingly conservative Southern state legislatures slashed the funding for Black Arts organizations. Though some managed to persevere, many others had to change their political mission to survive. But as Smethurst reminds his readers, these organizations would have shut down much earlier had they been in other regions; their difficulties in the 1980s after surviving many other conservative turns was less a mark of failure than it was a sign of success. 27 I n Behold the Land , Smethurst demonstrates that decades of organizing and institution building, from the Garveyite years and the Popular Front to the civil rights movement, helped preserve a Black radicalism in the South that eventually became central to the Black Arts Movement in the region. This radicalism was passed on both directly, as when SNYC members published Black Arts writers in Freedomways , and indirectly, as when the Southern Black Cultural Alliance provided a forum for Black Arts Movement workers to collaborate. But in all cases, the Black Arts and Black Power movements were driven by the goal \"to build a new culture of Black cooperation and self-determination.\" Doing so through the arts had the potential to reorient Black political relations toward a collective building of Black autonomy. \"The great strength of Black Arts, its grassroots character, makes it hard to grasp,\" Smethurst observes. \"Black Arts activities and institutions appeared in almost every community and on every campus where there was an appreciable number of Black people.\" By following some of the lines of Black Arts networks, Smethurst gestures toward the broader collaborative endeavors that enabled the movement to gain a foothold in the South and persevere through periods of conservatism. 28 Through interviews conducted with its surviving participants as well as archival research, Smethurst joins scholars like GerShun Avilez and Carter Mathes in revising the canonical understanding of the Black Arts Movement. Where Margo Crawford has argued, in Black Post-Blackness , that the movement foreshadowed contemporary Black artists in their complication of the meanings of Blackness, Smethurst demonstrates that one way that the Black Arts Movement did so was by building institutions that shaped, if not the contemporary artists directly, then the consumers of the art they produce, the venues in which they produce it, and the communities in which they grew up. This aesthetic legacy also bred a political one: The Black Arts Movement laid the foundation for contemporary community arts organizations, for the use of Black art in electoral campaigns, and for arts education as a Black radical, political practice. Though many Black Power organizations eventually folded, the Black Arts Movement helped spread and institutionalize their ideas. 29 This afterlife is especially clear in the long-lasting reach of Southern Black feminism. While scholars like Mary Helen Washington and activists like Mariame Kaba have worked to recover the often neglected history and legacy of midcentury Black radical feminists, Smethurst's account also reminds us of the role of those and other Popular Front radicals in the formation of the Black Arts Movement, especially in the South. Among the SNYC leaders that Smethurst discusses, for instance, was one Alabaman, Sallye Davis. While she worked as a national officer for the SNYC, she was also raising her daughter, Angela, in the intellectual and physical presence of Communist Party members. This early exposure to Marxism, one imagines, influenced not only Angela Davis's great Black Power autobiography, edited by Toni Morrison and published in 1974, but also her intellectual production and anti-carceral radicalism today. 30 In a similar fashion, the legacy of many Southern Black Arts Movement organizations lives on in the present. As Smethurst argues, they helped \"build new African American cultural institutions in historic African American communities that one finds throughout the South today, and the desire to construct networks between these institutions.\" This institutional and coalitional approach ensured that the unraveling of specific institutions did not mark the end of the Black Arts story. If, as Fannie Lou Hamer observed after viewing the Free Southern Theater's production of Waiting for Godot , Black people know something about waiting, they also know something about the long campaign. Liberation may not come tomorrow, but building institutions might mean that freedom can be achieved in the future. 31\n\nThis was the Free Southern Theater's goal. As cofounder John O'Neal recalled of its creation: 3 We claimed to be playwrights and poets; yet the political facts of life presented by the situation we first learned of in the South called for a life of useful (political or economic) engagement. How could we remain true to ourselves and our own concerns as artists and at the same time remain true to our developing recognition of political responsibility? 4 Their answer was a theater group that aimed, as another cofounder, Doris Derby, put it, \"to take the plays out to the rural areas, go around and perform out in the cotton fields or in the churches.\" They did so out of the belief that, as Nicholas later explained, \"the theater, the images, the language, the physicality of it would open doors in people's minds that they didn't necessarily need to read a lot of books to get to.\" For the Free Southern Theater's members, bringing the stage to the countryside made political education accessible while enabling artists to participate in politics. 5 As James Smethurst chronicles in Behold the Land: The Black Arts Movement in the South , the Free Southern Theater was just one of a number of institutions that sought to marry art with local Black Power politics in the South. In a sweeping history of arts institutions from the 1930s to the '80s, the book tells the story of how the turn to Black Power politics in the '60s produced a corollary Black Arts Movement that was especially long-lasting in the South. The Black Power and Black Arts movements, in Smethurst's account, were \"so twinned and joined at the hip that it is impossible, really, to tell where one begins and the other ends.\" While Black Power generally aimed to develop Black autonomy rather than gain inclusion in American society, the Black Arts Movement sought to produce a culture that valued Black people and used cultural forms like theater to encourage their entry into Black Power politics. 6 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion How a Human Rights Lawyer Went From Hero to House Arrest How a Human Rights Lawyer Went From Hero to House Arrest Feature / James North This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion How a Human Rights Lawyer Went From Hero to House Arrest How a Human Rights Lawyer Went From Hero to House Arrest Feature / James North This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal How the Free Southern Theater and other Southern Black Arts Movement institutions were funded is central to Smethurst's story. As he notes, among the enduring successes of the Black Power movement in the South were its electoral victories, which allowed politicians like Maynard Jackson, the first Black mayor of Atlanta, to allocate funding to Black arts institutions. \"The movement in the South,\" Smethurst writes, \"saw some of the most intense publicly supported institutionalization of African American art and culture of anywhere in the country.\" Financing these institutions enabled them to outlast not only the Black Arts Movement's greatest period of success in Northern cities like New York but also the early stages of post-civil-rights Southern conservatism. Their longevity ensured that these institutions continued to provide essential services and arts instruction to Black communities. In his careful attention to this history, Smethurst reminds readers that building solid institutions can provide a means of outlasting the backlash that inevitably follows radical progress. 7 Current Issue View our current issue S methurst's history begins with Marcus Garvey's early-20th-century Black nationalism and the Black communism of the 1930s, which together, he argues, laid the groundwork for the civil rights, Black Power, and Black Arts movements. In the 1910s and '20s, Garvey pushed for the creation of a nation in Africa to which all the descendants of enslaved people could repatriate. His biggest organization was the Universal Negro Improvement Association, which likely reached millions of people at its height in the early 20th century. While Garvey was largely based in New York City, the association was especially prominent in the South: In Miami the UNIA organized self-defense, and in New Orleans it supported labor organizing and a clinic providing health care to Black people. It also sponsored a jazz band, foreshadowing the twinned emphasis of later Black nationalists on material change and cultural production. 8 Garveyism declined in the late 1920s, after Garvey's 1927 deportation to Jamaica. In its wake, many UNIA members flocked to the Communist Party, which became increasingly prominent in Black politics, especially in the South, where the struggle against the Depression and segregation attracted many new members to the party and its subsidiary organizations. Art as well as labor politics were central sites for Black and white Communists organizing in the South. 9 Eventually headquartered in Birmingham, Ala., a Communist Party stronghold, the Southern Negro Youth Congress was founded in 1937 both to pursue revolutionary change and to promote Black art. The SNYC's Puppet Caravan Theatre performed plays about labor and voting rights for Southern farmworkers. It also provided political experience for activists like Ernest Wright, who helped lead the People's Defense League in New Orleans, which marched for jobs and the right to vote and against police brutality. 10 Elsewhere in New Orleans, the Dillard History Unit, founded in 1936 and funded by the Federal Writers' Project, employed the novelist Margaret Walker and contributed to the history The Negro in Louisiana . And in Atlanta in 1942, the visual artist and professor Hale Woodruff joined W.E.B. Du Bois at Atlanta University's People's School in creating a program to educate local adults. In these and other organizations, Smethurst writes, the cross-organizational politics rooted in the Communist Party \"became the most viable space for building radical African American institutions with a bent toward Black self-determination in most of the South.\" 11 McCarthyism and the Second Red Scare resulted in the persecution of leftists in the early postwar years, but many of these Black cultural workers continued to be active in their communities. In 1941, John Biggers enrolled at the Hampton Institute in Virginia, where he was taught by Elizabeth Catlett, who had worked with the Dillard History Unit. In 1949, Biggers joined Texas Southern University, one of the nation's historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), as head of the art department, where he pushed students and instructors to interact with local Black communities. In the 1950s, he began painting murals in poor Black areas in Houston. Biggers was not alone in his persistence: Organizers like Anne and Carl Braden in Kentucky and writers like Sterling Brown in Washington, D.C., continued the project of keeping radical ideas and Black organizing alive in a time of segregation and anti-communist repression. 12 The Black radicalism that informed the Communist Party and many of its subsidiary groups in the South also provided an impetus for Black activism in an era in which the civil rights movement was heating up. In 1949, the demise of the SNYC led several members, including Esther Cooper Jackson, to move north to work for Paul Robeson's Black Marxist newspaper Freedom (where a young Lorraine Hansberry also worked). In 1955, Freedom succumbed to a lack of funding, in part because potential donors feared FBI harassment (and rightfully so, since the bureau was known to have photographed the license plates of those who attended Robeson's concerts). But in 1961, Jackson and other former SNYC leaders started the journal Freedomways , which repurposed 1930s radicalism and socialism for the ascendant civil rights movement. Freedomways published older Black radicals like Shirley Graham Du Bois, rising stars like Audre Lorde, and Black nationalists like Sonia Sanchez. In Smethurst's words, Freedomways \"served as a model of what a radical Black political and cultural journal that embodied the principle of self-determination might be...and practically supported the work and institutions of younger Black artists and intellectuals.\" In so doing, Freedomways created a bridge between different generations of the South's Black left and helped to lay the foundations for a new era of social activism and radical arts. 13 T he South proved to be an especially fertile ground from which civil rights organizers were able to harvest the fruit of seeds sown by past radical movements. In the 1960s, the region was home to about half of all Black Americans living in the United States. It hosted a large consortium of HBCUs, which provided shelter for teachers who might have fallen victim to anti-communism at other institutions. And the South provided a home base for SNCC, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and many of the other best-known civil rights groups and organizers. \"By the early 1960s,\" Smethurst writes, \"the South was the terrain of the most vibrant and diverse grassroots Black political activity in the United States, ranging from direct action nonviolent protest to actual armed self-defense.\" 14 Amid the tumult of the civil rights movement, Black artists sought out new means of making their work relevant to Black politics. In 1964, two members of SNCC's literacy project and a journalist employed by the Mississippi Free Press put their interest in theater to good use by forming the Free Southern Theater. Conceived as a cultural wing of SNCC, the group offered a writing workshop and staged drama for Black Southerners out of its base at Tougaloo College, until police harassment forced it to move to New Orleans. Though rehearsed, the Free Southern Theater's productions required improvisation because Black Southerners often interacted with the performers, including on one occasion when an audience member stood onstage for much of the play. One cofounder, John O'Neal, encouraged as much when he told the audience, \"You are the actors.\" The theater group may have read the lines and provided the set, but poor Black Southerners were the actual protagonists, and their lives were the central dramatic arc. 15 Like many radical Black organizations in the mid-1960s, the Free Southern Theater eventually moved past the integrationist politics of the early civil rights movement and began to concentrate on developing Black culture. This focus on cultural nationalism was occasioned in part by the arrival in 1965 of Tom Dent, a New Orleans native who had left the South for New York. In his time in the North, Dent had participated in Black cultural and political organizations whose members included Maya Angelou, Ishmael Reed, Amiri Baraka, Harold Cruse, and Archie Shepp. But Dent had grown frustrated with the factionalism of many Black Power and Black Arts Movement activists in New York and decided to return to the Big Easy to help bring their ideas (but not their infighting) home. Once there, Dent soon fell in with the Free Southern Theater, and through his extensive contacts the group garnered new financial, personal, and institutional support. The following year, Dent became chairman of the theater's board and facilitated its move from \"an integrated civil rights institution,\" Smethurst writes, \"to a more self-consciously Black theater with a strong nationalist bent.\" This change meant the departure of the group's white members, but it also provided new possibilities. Under Dent, the Free Southern Theater transitioned \"from civil rights to Black Arts, from Negro to Black, from serving the folk of the Black South to being emphatically southern in a Black modality.\" 16 Organizations across the South followed a similar trajectory. At Howard University in Washington, D.C., the poet Sterling Brown mentored students who became key organizers in SNCC as well as those who became noted Black Power activists, including Stokely Carmichael, and Black Arts Movement writers, such as Baraka and Toni Morrison. Off campus, the poet Gaston Neal used War on Poverty funds to establish the Cardozo Area Arts Committee, which in 1965 started the New School of Afro-American Thought, an education and cultural center that taught literature courses to nearby residents. Its opening event featured Black artists ranging from the Harlem Renaissance to the Black Arts Movement, from Brown to Baraka. In the following years, it hosted many important jazz musicians, including Sun Ra's Arkestra and Joseph Jarman. At another HBCU, Nashville's Fisk University, in 1966, the novelist John Oliver Killens organized the Black Writers Conference. Though Baraka was not among the participants, \"the new militant nationalist writing was a specter haunting the conference,\" Smethurst notes. In time, that specter made itself felt. 17 I n the late 1960s and the early '70s, Black Power radicals and artists opened new institutions and transformed older ones to marry the arts and politics. At the 1967 Black Writers Conference at Fisk, Baraka dominated the proceedings, while several older Black writers, including Gwendolyn Brooks, championed the Black Power and Black Arts movements. That same year, one of Brown's mentees, Charlie Cobb, visited the pan-African Parisian bookstore Présence Africaine, which inspired him to create a Black nationalist bookstore, Drum and Spear, in D.C. with other SNCC alumni in 1968. Another of Brown's mentees, A.B. Spellman, moved from New York to Atlanta, where he joined Morehouse professor Stephen Henderson and the historian Vincent Harding in forming what would become the first Black think tank, the Institute of the Black World, which they founded in 1969. And though the Free Southern Theater stopped its tours that year, in part because of diminished funding, its mission of spreading Black culture and inspiring Black people to create their own cultural institutions was sweeping the South. 18 The assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 and the Black uprisings across the nation that followed pushed these organizers to reconsider the relationship between their institutions and local Black communities. At the newly founded Drum and Spear, Cobb and others hosted political meetings, classes, and readings, including poetry by Gaston Neal. Drum and Spear Press also reprinted C.L.R. James's 1938 A History of Pan-African Revolt and a translated collection of Palestinian poetry, Enemy of the Sun . Elsewhere in the city, James Garrett, whose family had a history of radical organizing and who had helped found the Black studies program at San Francisco State, began running the Black studies department at the newly opened Federal City College. There, he hired Cobb and other SNCC alumni involved with Drum and Spear. As Cobb recalled: 19 The question of black education turned on the question or issue of what you were going to do with your education once you finished.... The question you had to confront as a college student was, \"Upon graduation, how am I going to use my education for the black community?\" 20 Email This pedagogical philosophy reoriented many disciplines, from science to literature, toward practical means of serving Black people. Though clashes with administrators led Garrett and others to leave Federal City College and establish a community school, the Center for Black Education, their new approach to the academy influenced other institutions. 21 Where D.C. became a hub for rethinking Black education, New Orleans served as a locus for rethinking Black art. In 1968, the Tulane Drama Review , edited by onetime Free Southern Theater member Richard Schechner, published its landmark \"Black Theatre\" issue. Among the offerings was Larry Neal's foundational essay \"The Black Arts Movement,\" which described the movement's ongoing efforts as the cultural wing of Black Power. If the Black Arts Movement sought to create culture that aided autonomous political efforts, as Neal suggested, the Free Southern Theater put that theory into practice. At the time, its theater troupe formally separated from the group's writers' workshop, BLKARTSOUTH, then under the leadership of Dent and Kalamu ya Salaam. \"For Black theater to have viability in our communities we must have a working tie to those communities,\" Dent wrote of the group's mission, \"something more than the mere performance of plays now and then.\" Consequently, BLKARTSOUTH was composed entirely of New Orleanians, presented their original work, and primarily cast residents as actors. By valorizing the workshop over the production, BLKARTSOUTH embodied a defining trait of the Black Arts Movement: It valued \"process over product.\" 22 Groups across the South likewise experimented with creating new institutions to develop Black culture and political thought. In 1969, the Institute for the Black World began running seminars in Atlanta. \"We were trying to put forward the idea,\" Vincent Harding later recalled, \"that Black scholarship and Black activism were not meant to be separated...and that all of that should be permeated by the arts as well.\" Members of Duke University's Afro-American Association followed through on Harding's goals in Raleigh-Durham, when protests on campus led them to found Malcolm X Liberation University, which aimed to provide an alternative education for Durham's Black residents, including Duke students seeking refuge from a violent campus. And in Nashville in 1970, HBCU faculty and staff founded People's College to teach political and cultural analysis in ways that applied to everyday life. They did so because they saw educating Black people and creating a unique Black culture as essential to building Black nationalism. 23 As the Black Power and Black Arts movements progressed across the South, they increasingly directed their energy toward electoral campaigns as well as the arts and education. In his 1970 \"Coordinator's Statement,\" delivered at the founding convention of the Congress of Afrikan Peoples in Atlanta, Baraka emphasized the importance of voter registration and mobilizing the Black vote. Art played a key part in that effort, with singers like Stevie Wonder, James Brown, and Isaac Hayes supporting Kenneth Gibson's successful 1970 mayoral campaign in Newark. And these electoral victories, as Smethurst notes, also helped the Black Arts Movement by giving \"Black people the administration of political apparatuses with significant control over material resources not before available to Black Power and Black Arts groups.\" 24 Perhaps nowhere was the importance of electoral victories to bolster the Black Arts Movement more on display than in Atlanta. Following his election in 1973, the city's \"culture mayor,\" Maynard Jackson, pledged better funding for the arts. His former speechwriter Michael Lomax led that effort: In 1974 he, the poet Ebon Dooley, and another Jackson campaign staffer and writer, Pearl Cleage, founded the Neighborhood Arts Center, which provided arts education and hosted theater groups in a working-class Black neighborhood. Lomax also helped the writer Toni Cade Bambara secure a position as a writer in residence at Spelman College, another HBCU. In 1975 Jackson appointed Lomax as director of cultural affairs, a position through which he continued financing Black Arts Movement institutions; and in 1978 Bambara, Dooley, and Alice Lovelace founded the Southern Collective of African American Writers, which the Neighborhood Arts Center hosted. In 1979 Lomax helped establish the Fulton County Arts Council, which funded Black Arts Movement organizations throughout the county. By gaining control of the government's spending power through the vote, politicians like Lomax and Jackson, and artists like Bambara and Dooley, developed Atlanta into a hub for radical Black culture. 25 Regional collaborations bolstered these efforts. As the Free Southern Theater and BLKARTSOUTH unraveled in the early 1970s, Dent turned his attention to arts organizations in the South more broadly. He had \"a great dissatisfaction,\" he later recalled, \"with the situation in the early '70s, because I knew that what they were doing in New York was about on the same level with us, but we just didn't have any money.\" Hoping to gain greater recognition and funding, Dent founded the Southern Black Cultural Alliance, which held yearly business meetings at which various organizations could learn from one another how to solve their problems.

It also provided political experience for activists like Ernest Wright, who helped lead the People's Defense League in New Orleans, which marched for jobs and the right to vote and against police brutality. 10 Elsewhere in New Orleans, the Dillard History Unit, founded in 1936 and funded by the Federal Writers' Project, employed the novelist Margaret Walker and contributed to the history The Negro in Louisiana . And in Atlanta in 1942, the visual artist and professor Hale Woodruff joined W.E.B. Du Bois at Atlanta University's People's School in creating a program to educate local adults. In these and other organizations, Smethurst writes, the cross-organizational politics rooted in the Communist Party \"became the most viable space for building radical African American institutions with a bent toward Black self-determination in most of the South.\" 11 McCarthyism and the Second Red Scare resulted in the persecution of leftists in the early postwar years, but many of these Black cultural workers continued to be active in their communities. In 1941, John Biggers enrolled at the Hampton Institute in Virginia, where he was taught by Elizabeth Catlett, who had worked with the Dillard History Unit. In 1949, Biggers joined Texas Southern University, one of the nation's historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), as head of the art department, where he pushed students and instructors to interact with local Black communities. In the 1950s, he began painting murals in poor Black areas in Houston. Biggers was not alone in his persistence: Organizers like Anne and Carl Braden in Kentucky and writers like Sterling Brown in Washington, D.C., continued the project of keeping radical ideas and Black organizing alive in a time of segregation and anti-communist repression. 12 The Black radicalism that informed the Communist Party and many of its subsidiary groups in the South also provided an impetus for Black activism in an era in which the civil rights movement was heating up. In 1949, the demise of the SNYC led several members, including Esther Cooper Jackson, to move north to work for Paul Robeson's Black Marxist newspaper Freedom (where a young Lorraine Hansberry also worked). In 1955, Freedom succumbed to a lack of funding, in part because potential donors feared FBI harassment (and rightfully so, since the bureau was known to have photographed the license plates of those who attended Robeson's concerts). But in 1961, Jackson and other former SNYC leaders started the journal Freedomways , which repurposed 1930s radicalism and socialism for the ascendant civil rights movement. Freedomways published older Black radicals like Shirley Graham Du Bois, rising stars like Audre Lorde, and Black nationalists like Sonia Sanchez. In Smethurst's words, Freedomways \"served as a model of what a radical Black political and cultural journal that embodied the principle of self-determination might be...and practically supported the work and institutions of younger Black artists and intellectuals.\" In so doing, Freedomways created a bridge between different generations of the South's Black left and helped to lay the foundations for a new era of social activism and radical arts. 13 T he South proved to be an especially fertile ground from which civil rights organizers were able to harvest the fruit of seeds sown by past radical movements. In the 1960s, the region was home to about half of all Black Americans living in the United States. It hosted a large consortium of HBCUs, which provided shelter for teachers who might have fallen victim to anti-communism at other institutions. And the South provided a home base for SNCC, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and many of the other best-known civil rights groups and organizers. \"By the early 1960s,\" Smethurst writes, \"the South was the terrain of the most vibrant and diverse grassroots Black political activity in the United States, ranging from direct action nonviolent protest to actual armed self-defense.\" 14 Amid the tumult of the civil rights movement, Black artists sought out new means of making their work relevant to Black politics. In 1964, two members of SNCC's literacy project and a journalist employed by the Mississippi Free Press put their interest in theater to good use by forming the Free Southern Theater. Conceived as a cultural wing of SNCC, the group offered a writing workshop and staged drama for Black Southerners out of its base at Tougaloo College, until police harassment forced it to move to New Orleans. Though rehearsed, the Free Southern Theater's productions required improvisation because Black Southerners often interacted with the performers, including on one occasion when an audience member stood onstage for much of the play. One cofounder, John O'Neal, encouraged as much when he told the audience, \"You are the actors.\" The theater group may have read the lines and provided the set, but poor Black Southerners were the actual protagonists, and their lives were the central dramatic arc. 15 Like many radical Black organizations in the mid-1960s, the Free Southern Theater eventually moved past the integrationist politics of the early civil rights movement and began to concentrate on developing Black culture. This focus on cultural nationalism was occasioned in part by the arrival in 1965 of Tom Dent, a New Orleans native who had left the South for New York. In his time in the North, Dent had participated in Black cultural and political organizations whose members included Maya Angelou, Ishmael Reed, Amiri Baraka, Harold Cruse, and Archie Shepp. But Dent had grown frustrated with the factionalism of many Black Power and Black Arts Movement activists in New York and decided to return to the Big Easy to help bring their ideas (but not their infighting) home. Once there, Dent soon fell in with the Free Southern Theater, and through his extensive contacts the group garnered new financial, personal, and institutional support. The following year, Dent became chairman of the theater's board and facilitated its move from \"an integrated civil rights institution,\" Smethurst writes, \"to a more self-consciously Black theater with a strong nationalist bent.\" This change meant the departure of the group's white members, but it also provided new possibilities. Under Dent, the Free Southern Theater transitioned \"from civil rights to Black Arts, from Negro to Black, from serving the folk of the Black South to being emphatically southern in a Black modality.\" 16 Organizations across the South followed a similar trajectory. At Howard University in Washington, D.C., the poet Sterling Brown mentored students who became key organizers in SNCC as well as those who became noted Black Power activists, including Stokely Carmichael, and Black Arts Movement writers, such as Baraka and Toni Morrison. Off campus, the poet Gaston Neal used War on Poverty funds to establish the Cardozo Area Arts Committee, which in 1965 started the New School of Afro-American Thought, an education and cultural center that taught literature courses to nearby residents. Its opening event featured Black artists ranging from the Harlem Renaissance to the Black Arts Movement, from Brown to Baraka. In the following years, it hosted many important jazz musicians, including Sun Ra's Arkestra and Joseph Jarman. At another HBCU, Nashville's Fisk University, in 1966, the novelist John Oliver Killens organized the Black Writers Conference. Though Baraka was not among the participants, \"the new militant nationalist writing was a specter haunting the conference,\" Smethurst notes. In time, that specter made itself felt. 17 I n the late 1960s and the early '70s, Black Power radicals and artists opened new institutions and transformed older ones to marry the arts and politics. At the 1967 Black Writers Conference at Fisk, Baraka dominated the proceedings, while several older Black writers, including Gwendolyn Brooks, championed the Black Power and Black Arts movements. That same year, one of Brown's mentees, Charlie Cobb, visited the pan-African Parisian bookstore Présence Africaine, which inspired him to create a Black nationalist bookstore, Drum and Spear, in D.C. with other SNCC alumni in 1968. Another of Brown's mentees, A.B. Spellman, moved from New York to Atlanta, where he joined Morehouse professor Stephen Henderson and the historian Vincent Harding in forming what would become the first Black think tank, the Institute of the Black World, which they founded in 1969. And though the Free Southern Theater stopped its tours that year, in part because of diminished funding, its mission of spreading Black culture and inspiring Black people to create their own cultural institutions was sweeping the South. 18 The assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 and the Black uprisings across the nation that followed pushed these organizers to reconsider the relationship between their institutions and local Black communities. At the newly founded Drum and Spear, Cobb and others hosted political meetings, classes, and readings, including poetry by Gaston Neal. Drum and Spear Press also reprinted C.L.R. James's 1938 A History of Pan-African Revolt and a translated collection of Palestinian poetry, Enemy of the Sun . Elsewhere in the city, James Garrett, whose family had a history of radical organizing and who had helped found the Black studies program at San Francisco State, began running the Black studies department at the newly opened Federal City College. There, he hired Cobb and other SNCC alumni involved with Drum and Spear. As Cobb recalled: 19 The question of black education turned on the question or issue of what you were going to do with your education once you finished.... The question you had to confront as a college student was, \"Upon graduation, how am I going to use my education for the black community?\" 20 Email This pedagogical philosophy reoriented many disciplines, from science to literature, toward practical means of serving Black people. Though clashes with administrators led Garrett and others to leave Federal City College and establish a community school, the Center for Black Education, their new approach to the academy influenced other institutions. 21 Where D.C. became a hub for rethinking Black education, New Orleans served as a locus for rethinking Black art. In 1968, the Tulane Drama Review , edited by onetime Free Southern Theater member Richard Schechner, published its landmark \"Black Theatre\" issue. Among the offerings was Larry Neal's foundational essay \"The Black Arts Movement,\" which described the movement's ongoing efforts as the cultural wing of Black Power. If the Black Arts Movement sought to create culture that aided autonomous political efforts, as Neal suggested, the Free Southern Theater put that theory into practice. At the time, its theater troupe formally separated from the group's writers' workshop, BLKARTSOUTH, then under the leadership of Dent and Kalamu ya Salaam. \"For Black theater to have viability in our communities we must have a working tie to those communities,\" Dent wrote of the group's mission, \"something more than the mere performance of plays now and then.\" Consequently, BLKARTSOUTH was composed entirely of New Orleanians, presented their original work, and primarily cast residents as actors. By valorizing the workshop over the production, BLKARTSOUTH embodied a defining trait of the Black Arts Movement: It valued \"process over product.\" 22 Groups across the South likewise experimented with creating new institutions to develop Black culture and political thought. In 1969, the Institute for the Black World began running seminars in Atlanta. \"We were trying to put forward the idea,\" Vincent Harding later recalled, \"that Black scholarship and Black activism were not meant to be separated...and that all of that should be permeated by the arts as well.\" Members of Duke University's Afro-American Association followed through on Harding's goals in Raleigh-Durham, when protests on campus led them to found Malcolm X Liberation University, which aimed to provide an alternative education for Durham's Black residents, including Duke students seeking refuge from a violent campus. And in Nashville in 1970, HBCU faculty and staff founded People's College to teach political and cultural analysis in ways that applied to everyday life. They did so because they saw educating Black people and creating a unique Black culture as essential to building Black nationalism. 23 As the Black Power and Black Arts movements progressed across the South, they increasingly directed their energy toward electoral campaigns as well as the arts and education. In his 1970 \"Coordinator's Statement,\" delivered at the founding convention of the Congress of Afrikan Peoples in Atlanta, Baraka emphasized the importance of voter registration and mobilizing the Black vote. Art played a key part in that effort, with singers like Stevie Wonder, James Brown, and Isaac Hayes supporting Kenneth Gibson's successful 1970 mayoral campaign in Newark. And these electoral victories, as Smethurst notes, also helped the Black Arts Movement by giving \"Black people the administration of political apparatuses with significant control over material resources not before available to Black Power and Black Arts groups.\" 24 Perhaps nowhere was the importance of electoral victories to bolster the Black Arts Movement more on display than in Atlanta. Following his election in 1973, the city's \"culture mayor,\" Maynard Jackson, pledged better funding for the arts. His former speechwriter Michael Lomax led that effort: In 1974 he, the poet Ebon Dooley, and another Jackson campaign staffer and writer, Pearl Cleage, founded the Neighborhood Arts Center, which provided arts education and hosted theater groups in a working-class Black neighborhood. Lomax also helped the writer Toni Cade Bambara secure a position as a writer in residence at Spelman College, another HBCU. In 1975 Jackson appointed Lomax as director of cultural affairs, a position through which he continued financing Black Arts Movement institutions; and in 1978 Bambara, Dooley, and Alice Lovelace founded the Southern Collective of African American Writers, which the Neighborhood Arts Center hosted. In 1979 Lomax helped establish the Fulton County Arts Council, which funded Black Arts Movement organizations throughout the county. By gaining control of the government's spending power through the vote, politicians like Lomax and Jackson, and artists like Bambara and Dooley, developed Atlanta into a hub for radical Black culture. 25 Regional collaborations bolstered these efforts. As the Free Southern Theater and BLKARTSOUTH unraveled in the early 1970s, Dent turned his attention to arts organizations in the South more broadly. He had \"a great dissatisfaction,\" he later recalled, \"with the situation in the early '70s, because I knew that what they were doing in New York was about on the same level with us, but we just didn't have any money.\" Hoping to gain greater recognition and funding, Dent founded the Southern Black Cultural Alliance, which held yearly business meetings at which various organizations could learn from one another how to solve their problems. The alliance also held a yearly conference that brought Black theater troupes and artists across the South to perform. Dent, Salaam, and others then wrote about the conference for a variety of magazines-most notably Hoyt Fuller's Atlanta-based First World , which replaced Black World -as a means of garnering new exposure for their work. By helping artists across the South, the Southern Black Cultural Alliance aided many Black Arts Movement groups in surviving difficult times. 26 Unfortunately, many of these organizations, in Atlanta and in the South more generally, faltered as the federal government scaled back its local funding in the 1980s. In the same year that Ronald Reagan was elected, First World published its final issue. In 1981, when Lomax became chair of the Fulton County Arts Council, the federal government defunded the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act, which had supported many local arts organizations; its 1982 replacement, the Job Placement Training Act, funded far fewer theaters than CETA had. The Reagan administration also provided fewer community block grants, while increasingly conservative Southern state legislatures slashed the funding for Black Arts organizations. Though some managed to persevere, many others had to change their political mission to survive. But as Smethurst reminds his readers, these organizations would have shut down much earlier had they been in other regions; their difficulties in the 1980s after surviving many other conservative turns was less a mark of failure than it was a sign of success. 27 I n Behold the Land , Smethurst demonstrates that decades of organizing and institution building, from the Garveyite years and the Popular Front to the civil rights movement, helped preserve a Black radicalism in the South that eventually became central to the Black Arts Movement in the region. This radicalism was passed on both directly, as when SNYC members published Black Arts writers in Freedomways , and indirectly, as when the Southern Black Cultural Alliance provided a forum for Black Arts Movement workers to collaborate. But in all cases, the Black Arts and Black Power movements were driven by the goal \"to build a new culture of Black cooperation and self-determination.\" Doing so through the arts had the potential to reorient Black political relations toward a collective building of Black autonomy. \"The great strength of Black Arts, its grassroots character, makes it hard to grasp,\" Smethurst observes. \"Black Arts activities and institutions appeared in almost every community and on every campus where there was an appreciable number of Black people.\" By following some of the lines of Black Arts networks, Smethurst gestures toward the broader collaborative endeavors that enabled the movement to gain a foothold in the South and persevere through periods of conservatism. 28 Through interviews conducted with its surviving participants as well as archival research, Smethurst joins scholars like GerShun Avilez and Carter Mathes in revising the canonical understanding of the Black Arts Movement. Where Margo Crawford has argued, in Black Post-Blackness , that the movement foreshadowed contemporary Black artists in their complication of the meanings of Blackness, Smethurst demonstrates that one way that the Black Arts Movement did so was by building institutions that shaped, if not the contemporary artists directly, then the consumers of the art they produce, the venues in which they produce it, and the communities in which they grew up. This aesthetic legacy also bred a political one: The Black Arts Movement laid the foundation for contemporary community arts organizations, for the use of Black art in electoral campaigns, and for arts education as a Black radical, political practice. Though many Black Power organizations eventually folded, the Black Arts Movement helped spread and institutionalize their ideas. 29 This afterlife is especially clear in the long-lasting reach of Southern Black feminism. While scholars like Mary Helen Washington and activists like Mariame Kaba have worked to recover the often neglected history and legacy of midcentury Black radical feminists, Smethurst's account also reminds us of the role of those and other Popular Front radicals in the formation of the Black Arts Movement, especially in the South. Among the SNYC leaders that Smethurst discusses, for instance, was one Alabaman, Sallye Davis. While she worked as a national officer for the SNYC, she was also raising her daughter, Angela, in the intellectual and physical presence of Communist Party members. This early exposure to Marxism, one imagines, influenced not only Angela Davis's great Black Power autobiography, edited by Toni Morrison and published in 1974, but also her intellectual production and anti-carceral radicalism today. 30 In a similar fashion, the legacy of many Southern Black Arts Movement organizations lives on in the present. As Smethurst argues, they helped \"build new African American cultural institutions in historic African American communities that one finds throughout the South today, and the desire to construct networks between these institutions.\" This institutional and coalitional approach ensured that the unraveling of specific institutions did not mark the end of the Black Arts story. If, as Fannie Lou Hamer observed after viewing the Free Southern Theater's production of Waiting for Godot , Black people know something about waiting, they also know something about the long campaign. Liberation may not come tomorrow, but building institutions might mean that freedom can be achieved in the future. 31\n\nAs James Smethurst chronicles in Behold the Land: The Black Arts Movement in the South , the Free Southern Theater was just one of a number of institutions that sought to marry art with local Black Power politics in the South. In a sweeping history of arts institutions from the 1930s to the '80s, the book tells the story of how the turn to Black Power politics in the '60s produced a corollary Black Arts Movement that was especially long-lasting in the South. The Black Power and Black Arts movements, in Smethurst's account, were \"so twinned and joined at the hip that it is impossible, really, to tell where one begins and the other ends.\" While Black Power generally aimed to develop Black autonomy rather than gain inclusion in American society, the Black Arts Movement sought to produce a culture that valued Black people and used cultural forms like theater to encourage their entry into Black Power politics. 6 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion How a Human Rights Lawyer Went From Hero to House Arrest How a Human Rights Lawyer Went From Hero to House Arrest Feature / James North This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion How a Human Rights Lawyer Went From Hero to House Arrest How a Human Rights Lawyer Went From Hero to House Arrest Feature / James North This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk In a Normal World, Harvard's Lawsuit Against Trump Would Be a Slam Dunk Elie Mystal How the Free Southern Theater and other Southern Black Arts Movement institutions were funded is central to Smethurst's story. As he notes, among the enduring successes of the Black Power movement in the South were its electoral victories, which allowed politicians like Maynard Jackson, the first Black mayor of Atlanta, to allocate funding to Black arts institutions. \"The movement in the South,\" Smethurst writes, \"saw some of the most intense publicly supported institutionalization of African American art and culture of anywhere in the country.\" Financing these institutions enabled them to outlast not only the Black Arts Movement's greatest period of success in Northern cities like New York but also the early stages of post-civil-rights Southern conservatism. Their longevity ensured that these institutions continued to provide essential services and arts instruction to Black communities. In his careful attention to this history, Smethurst reminds readers that building solid institutions can provide a means of outlasting the backlash that inevitably follows radical progress. 7 Current Issue View our current issue S methurst's history begins with Marcus Garvey's early-20th-century Black nationalism and the Black communism of the 1930s, which together, he argues, laid the groundwork for the civil rights, Black Power, and Black Arts movements. In the 1910s and '20s, Garvey pushed for the creation of a nation in Africa to which all the descendants of enslaved people could repatriate. His biggest organization was the Universal Negro Improvement Association, which likely reached millions of people at its height in the early 20th century. While Garvey was largely based in New York City, the association was especially prominent in the South: In Miami the UNIA organized self-defense, and in New Orleans it supported labor organizing and a clinic providing health care to Black people. It also sponsored a jazz band, foreshadowing the twinned emphasis of later Black nationalists on material change and cultural production. 8 Garveyism declined in the late 1920s, after Garvey's 1927 deportation to Jamaica. In its wake, many UNIA members flocked to the Communist Party, which became increasingly prominent in Black politics, especially in the South, where the struggle against the Depression and segregation attracted many new members to the party and its subsidiary organizations. Art as well as labor politics were central sites for Black and white Communists organizing in the South. 9 Eventually headquartered in Birmingham, Ala., a Communist Party stronghold, the Southern Negro Youth Congress was founded in 1937 both to pursue revolutionary change and to promote Black art. The SNYC's Puppet Caravan Theatre performed plays about labor and voting rights for Southern farmworkers. It also provided political experience for activists like Ernest Wright, who helped lead the People's Defense League in New Orleans, which marched for jobs and the right to vote and against police brutality. 10 Elsewhere in New Orleans, the Dillard History Unit, founded in 1936 and funded by the Federal Writers' Project, employed the novelist Margaret Walker and contributed to the history The Negro in Louisiana .

Art played a key part in that effort, with singers like Stevie Wonder, James Brown, and Isaac Hayes supporting Kenneth Gibson's successful 1970 mayoral campaign in Newark. And these electoral victories, as Smethurst notes, also helped the Black Arts Movement by giving \"Black people the administration of political apparatuses with significant control over material resources not before available to Black Power and Black Arts groups.\" 24 Perhaps nowhere was the importance of electoral victories to bolster the Black Arts Movement more on display than in Atlanta. Following his election in 1973, the city's \"culture mayor,\" Maynard Jackson, pledged better funding for the arts. His former speechwriter Michael Lomax led that effort: In 1974 he, the poet Ebon Dooley, and another Jackson campaign staffer and writer, Pearl Cleage, founded the Neighborhood Arts Center, which provided arts education and hosted theater groups in a working-class Black neighborhood. Lomax also helped the writer Toni Cade Bambara secure a position as a writer in residence at Spelman College, another HBCU. In 1975 Jackson appointed Lomax as director of cultural affairs, a position through which he continued financing Black Arts Movement institutions; and in 1978 Bambara, Dooley, and Alice Lovelace founded the Southern Collective of African American Writers, which the Neighborhood Arts Center hosted. In 1979 Lomax helped establish the Fulton County Arts Council, which funded Black Arts Movement organizations throughout the county. By gaining control of the government's spending power through the vote, politicians like Lomax and Jackson, and artists like Bambara and Dooley, developed Atlanta into a hub for radical Black culture. 25 Regional collaborations bolstered these efforts. As the Free Southern Theater and BLKARTSOUTH unraveled in the early 1970s, Dent turned his attention to arts organizations in the South more broadly. He had \"a great dissatisfaction,\" he later recalled, \"with the situation in the early '70s, because I knew that what they were doing in New York was about on the same level with us, but we just didn't have any money.\" Hoping to gain greater recognition and funding, Dent founded the Southern Black Cultural Alliance, which held yearly business meetings at which various organizations could learn from one another how to solve their problems. The alliance also held a yearly conference that brought Black theater troupes and artists across the South to perform. Dent, Salaam, and others then wrote about the conference for a variety of magazines-most notably Hoyt Fuller's Atlanta-based First World , which replaced Black World -as a means of garnering new exposure for their work. By helping artists across the South, the Southern Black Cultural Alliance aided many Black Arts Movement groups in surviving difficult times. 26 Unfortunately, many of these organizations, in Atlanta and in the South more generally, faltered as the federal government scaled back its local funding in the 1980s. In the same year that Ronald Reagan was elected, First World published its final issue. In 1981, when Lomax became chair of the Fulton County Arts Council, the federal government defunded the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act, which had supported many local arts organizations; its 1982 replacement, the Job Placement Training Act, funded far fewer theaters than CETA had. The Reagan administration also provided fewer community block grants, while increasingly conservative Southern state legislatures slashed the funding for Black Arts organizations. Though some managed to persevere, many others had to change their political mission to survive. But as Smethurst reminds his readers, these organizations would have shut down much earlier had they been in other regions; their difficulties in the 1980s after surviving many other conservative turns was less a mark of failure than it was a sign of success. 27 I n Behold the Land , Smethurst demonstrates that decades of organizing and institution building, from the Garveyite years and the Popular Front to the civil rights movement, helped preserve a Black radicalism in the South that eventually became central to the Black Arts Movement in the region. This radicalism was passed on both directly, as when SNYC members published Black Arts writers in Freedomways , and indirectly, as when the Southern Black Cultural Alliance provided a forum for Black Arts Movement workers to collaborate. But in all cases, the Black Arts and Black Power movements were driven by the goal \"to build a new culture of Black cooperation and self-determination.\" Doing so through the arts had the potential to reorient Black political relations toward a collective building of Black autonomy. \"The great strength of Black Arts, its grassroots character, makes it hard to grasp,\" Smethurst observes. \"Black Arts activities and institutions appeared in almost every community and on every campus where there was an appreciable number of Black people.\" By following some of the lines of Black Arts networks, Smethurst gestures toward the broader collaborative endeavors that enabled the movement to gain a foothold in the South and persevere through periods of conservatism. 28 Through interviews conducted with its surviving participants as well as archival research, Smethurst joins scholars like GerShun Avilez and Carter Mathes in revising the canonical understanding of the Black Arts Movement. Where Margo Crawford has argued, in Black Post-Blackness , that the movement foreshadowed contemporary Black artists in their complication of the meanings of Blackness, Smethurst demonstrates that one way that the Black Arts Movement did so was by building institutions that shaped, if not the contemporary artists directly, then the consumers of the art they produce, the venues in which they produce it, and the communities in which they grew up. This aesthetic legacy also bred a political one: The Black Arts Movement laid the foundation for contemporary community arts organizations, for the use of Black art in electoral campaigns, and for arts education as a Black radical, political practice. Though many Black Power organizations eventually folded, the Black Arts Movement helped spread and institutionalize their ideas. 29 This afterlife is especially clear in the long-lasting reach of Southern Black feminism. While scholars like Mary Helen Washington and activists like Mariame Kaba have worked to recover the often neglected history and legacy of midcentury Black radical feminists, Smethurst's account also reminds us of the role of those and other Popular Front radicals in the formation of the Black Arts Movement, especially in the South. Among the SNYC leaders that Smethurst discusses, for instance, was one Alabaman, Sallye Davis. While she worked as a national officer for the SNYC, she was also raising her daughter, Angela, in the intellectual and physical presence of Communist Party members. This early exposure to Marxism, one imagines, influenced not only Angela Davis's great Black Power autobiography, edited by Toni Morrison and published in 1974, but also her intellectual production and anti-carceral radicalism today. 30 In a similar fashion, the legacy of many Southern Black Arts Movement organizations lives on in the present. As Smethurst argues, they helped \"build new African American cultural institutions in historic African American communities that one finds throughout the South today, and the desire to construct networks between these institutions.\" This institutional and coalitional approach ensured that the unraveling of specific institutions did not mark the end of the Black Arts story. If, as Fannie Lou Hamer observed after viewing the Free Southern Theater's production of Waiting for Godot , Black people know something about waiting, they also know something about the long campaign. Liberation may not come tomorrow, but building institutions might mean that freedom can be achieved in the future. 31\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nFeature / James North\n\nElie Mystal\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nFeature / James North\n\nElie Mystal\n\nElie Mystal\n\nHow the Free Southern Theater and other Southern Black Arts Movement institutions were funded is central to Smethurst's story. As he notes, among the enduring successes of the Black Power movement in the South were its electoral victories, which allowed politicians like Maynard Jackson, the first Black mayor of Atlanta, to allocate funding to Black arts institutions. \"The movement in the South,\" Smethurst writes, \"saw some of the most intense publicly supported institutionalization of African American art and culture of anywhere in the country.\" Financing these institutions enabled them to outlast not only the Black Arts Movement's greatest period of success in Northern cities like New York but also the early stages of post-civil-rights Southern conservatism. Their longevity ensured that these institutions continued to provide essential services and arts instruction to Black communities. In his careful attention to this history, Smethurst reminds readers that building solid institutions can provide a means of outlasting the backlash that inevitably follows radical progress. 7 Current Issue View our current issue S methurst's history begins with Marcus Garvey's early-20th-century Black nationalism and the Black communism of the 1930s, which together, he argues, laid the groundwork for the civil rights, Black Power, and Black Arts movements. In the 1910s and '20s, Garvey pushed for the creation of a nation in Africa to which all the descendants of enslaved people could repatriate. His biggest organization was the Universal Negro Improvement Association, which likely reached millions of people at its height in the early 20th century. While Garvey was largely based in New York City, the association was especially prominent in the South: In Miami the UNIA organized self-defense, and in New Orleans it supported labor organizing and a clinic providing health care to Black people. It also sponsored a jazz band, foreshadowing the twinned emphasis of later Black nationalists on material change and cultural production. 8 Garveyism declined in the late 1920s, after Garvey's 1927 deportation to Jamaica. In its wake, many UNIA members flocked to the Communist Party, which became increasingly prominent in Black politics, especially in the South, where the struggle against the Depression and segregation attracted many new members to the party and its subsidiary organizations. Art as well as labor politics were central sites for Black and white Communists organizing in the South. 9 Eventually headquartered in Birmingham, Ala., a Communist Party stronghold, the Southern Negro Youth Congress was founded in 1937 both to pursue revolutionary change and to promote Black art. The SNYC's Puppet Caravan Theatre performed plays about labor and voting rights for Southern farmworkers. It also provided political experience for activists like Ernest Wright, who helped lead the People's Defense League in New Orleans, which marched for jobs and the right to vote and against police brutality. 10 Elsewhere in New Orleans, the Dillard History Unit, founded in 1936 and funded by the Federal Writers' Project, employed the novelist Margaret Walker and contributed to the history The Negro in Louisiana . And in Atlanta in 1942, the visual artist and professor Hale Woodruff joined W.E.B. Du Bois at Atlanta University's People's School in creating a program to educate local adults. In these and other organizations, Smethurst writes, the cross-organizational politics rooted in the Communist Party \"became the most viable space for building radical African American institutions with a bent toward Black self-determination in most of the South.\" 11 McCarthyism and the Second Red Scare resulted in the persecution of leftists in the early postwar years, but many of these Black cultural workers continued to be active in their communities. In 1941, John Biggers enrolled at the Hampton Institute in Virginia, where he was taught by Elizabeth Catlett, who had worked with the Dillard History Unit. In 1949, Biggers joined Texas Southern University, one of the nation's historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), as head of the art department, where he pushed students and instructors to interact with local Black communities. In the 1950s, he began painting murals in poor Black areas in Houston. Biggers was not alone in his persistence: Organizers like Anne and Carl Braden in Kentucky and writers like Sterling Brown in Washington, D.C., continued the project of keeping radical ideas and Black organizing alive in a time of segregation and anti-communist repression. 12 The Black radicalism that informed the Communist Party and many of its subsidiary groups in the South also provided an impetus for Black activism in an era in which the civil rights movement was heating up. In 1949, the demise of the SNYC led several members, including Esther Cooper Jackson, to move north to work for Paul Robeson's Black Marxist newspaper Freedom (where a young Lorraine Hansberry also worked). In 1955, Freedom succumbed to a lack of funding, in part because potential donors feared FBI harassment (and rightfully so, since the bureau was known to have photographed the license plates of those who attended Robeson's concerts). But in 1961, Jackson and other former SNYC leaders started the journal Freedomways , which repurposed 1930s radicalism and socialism for the ascendant civil rights movement. Freedomways published older Black radicals like Shirley Graham Du Bois, rising stars like Audre Lorde, and Black nationalists like Sonia Sanchez. In Smethurst's words, Freedomways \"served as a model of what a radical Black political and cultural journal that embodied the principle of self-determination might be...and practically supported the work and institutions of younger Black artists and intellectuals.\" In so doing, Freedomways created a bridge between different generations of the South's Black left and helped to lay the foundations for a new era of social activism and radical arts. 13 T he South proved to be an especially fertile ground from which civil rights organizers were able to harvest the fruit of seeds sown by past radical movements. In the 1960s, the region was home to about half of all Black Americans living in the United States. It hosted a large consortium of HBCUs, which provided shelter for teachers who might have fallen victim to anti-communism at other institutions. And the South provided a home base for SNCC, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and many of the other best-known civil rights groups and organizers. \"By the early 1960s,\" Smethurst writes, \"the South was the terrain of the most vibrant and diverse grassroots Black political activity in the United States, ranging from direct action nonviolent protest to actual armed self-defense.\" 14 Amid the tumult of the civil rights movement, Black artists sought out new means of making their work relevant to Black politics. In 1964, two members of SNCC's literacy project and a journalist employed by the Mississippi Free Press put their interest in theater to good use by forming the Free Southern Theater. Conceived as a cultural wing of SNCC, the group offered a writing workshop and staged drama for Black Southerners out of its base at Tougaloo College, until police harassment forced it to move to New Orleans. Though rehearsed, the Free Southern Theater's productions required improvisation because Black Southerners often interacted with the performers, including on one occasion when an audience member stood onstage for much of the play. One cofounder, John O'Neal, encouraged as much when he told the audience, \"You are the actors.\" The theater group may have read the lines and provided the set, but poor Black Southerners were the actual protagonists, and their lives were the central dramatic arc. 15 Like many radical Black organizations in the mid-1960s, the Free Southern Theater eventually moved past the integrationist politics of the early civil rights movement and began to concentrate on developing Black culture. This focus on cultural nationalism was occasioned in part by the arrival in 1965 of Tom Dent, a New Orleans native who had left the South for New York. In his time in the North, Dent had participated in Black cultural and political organizations whose members included Maya Angelou, Ishmael Reed, Amiri Baraka, Harold Cruse, and Archie Shepp. But Dent had grown frustrated with the factionalism of many Black Power and Black Arts Movement activists in New York and decided to return to the Big Easy to help bring their ideas (but not their infighting) home. Once there, Dent soon fell in with the Free Southern Theater, and through his extensive contacts the group garnered new financial, personal, and institutional support. The following year, Dent became chairman of the theater's board and facilitated its move from \"an integrated civil rights institution,\" Smethurst writes, \"to a more self-consciously Black theater with a strong nationalist bent.\" This change meant the departure of the group's white members, but it also provided new possibilities. Under Dent, the Free Southern Theater transitioned \"from civil rights to Black Arts, from Negro to Black, from serving the folk of the Black South to being emphatically southern in a Black modality.\" 16 Organizations across the South followed a similar trajectory. At Howard University in Washington, D.C., the poet Sterling Brown mentored students who became key organizers in SNCC as well as those who became noted Black Power activists, including Stokely Carmichael, and Black Arts Movement writers, such as Baraka and Toni Morrison. Off campus, the poet Gaston Neal used War on Poverty funds to establish the Cardozo Area Arts Committee, which in 1965 started the New School of Afro-American Thought, an education and cultural center that taught literature courses to nearby residents. Its opening event featured Black artists ranging from the Harlem Renaissance to the Black Arts Movement, from Brown to Baraka. In the following years, it hosted many important jazz musicians, including Sun Ra's Arkestra and Joseph Jarman. At another HBCU, Nashville's Fisk University, in 1966, the novelist John Oliver Killens organized the Black Writers Conference. Though Baraka was not among the participants, \"the new militant nationalist writing was a specter haunting the conference,\" Smethurst notes. In time, that specter made itself felt. 17 I n the late 1960s and the early '70s, Black Power radicals and artists opened new institutions and transformed older ones to marry the arts and politics. At the 1967 Black Writers Conference at Fisk, Baraka dominated the proceedings, while several older Black writers, including Gwendolyn Brooks, championed the Black Power and Black Arts movements. That same year, one of Brown's mentees, Charlie Cobb, visited the pan-African Parisian bookstore Présence Africaine, which inspired him to create a Black nationalist bookstore, Drum and Spear, in D.C. with other SNCC alumni in 1968. Another of Brown's mentees, A.B. Spellman, moved from New York to Atlanta, where he joined Morehouse professor Stephen Henderson and the historian Vincent Harding in forming what would become the first Black think tank, the Institute of the Black World, which they founded in 1969. And though the Free Southern Theater stopped its tours that year, in part because of diminished funding, its mission of spreading Black culture and inspiring Black people to create their own cultural institutions was sweeping the South. 18 The assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 and the Black uprisings across the nation that followed pushed these organizers to reconsider the relationship between their institutions and local Black communities. At the newly founded Drum and Spear, Cobb and others hosted political meetings, classes, and readings, including poetry by Gaston Neal. Drum and Spear Press also reprinted C.L.R. James's 1938 A History of Pan-African Revolt and a translated collection of Palestinian poetry, Enemy of the Sun . Elsewhere in the city, James Garrett, whose family had a history of radical organizing and who had helped found the Black studies program at San Francisco State, began running the Black studies department at the newly opened Federal City College. There, he hired Cobb and other SNCC alumni involved with Drum and Spear. As Cobb recalled: 19 The question of black education turned on the question or issue of what you were going to do with your education once you finished.... The question you had to confront as a college student was, \"Upon graduation, how am I going to use my education for the black community?\" 20 Email This pedagogical philosophy reoriented many disciplines, from science to literature, toward practical means of serving Black people. Though clashes with administrators led Garrett and others to leave Federal City College and establish a community school, the Center for Black Education, their new approach to the academy influenced other institutions. 21 Where D.C. became a hub for rethinking Black education, New Orleans served as a locus for rethinking Black art. In 1968, the Tulane Drama Review , edited by onetime Free Southern Theater member Richard Schechner, published its landmark \"Black Theatre\" issue. Among the offerings was Larry Neal's foundational essay \"The Black Arts Movement,\" which described the movement's ongoing efforts as the cultural wing of Black Power. If the Black Arts Movement sought to create culture that aided autonomous political efforts, as Neal suggested, the Free Southern Theater put that theory into practice. At the time, its theater troupe formally separated from the group's writers' workshop, BLKARTSOUTH, then under the leadership of Dent and Kalamu ya Salaam. \"For Black theater to have viability in our communities we must have a working tie to those communities,\" Dent wrote of the group's mission, \"something more than the mere performance of plays now and then.\" Consequently, BLKARTSOUTH was composed entirely of New Orleanians, presented their original work, and primarily cast residents as actors. By valorizing the workshop over the production, BLKARTSOUTH embodied a defining trait of the Black Arts Movement: It valued \"process over product.\" 22 Groups across the South likewise experimented with creating new institutions to develop Black culture and political thought. In 1969, the Institute for the Black World began running seminars in Atlanta. \"We were trying to put forward the idea,\" Vincent Harding later recalled, \"that Black scholarship and Black activism were not meant to be separated...and that all of that should be permeated by the arts as well.\" Members of Duke University's Afro-American Association followed through on Harding's goals in Raleigh-Durham, when protests on campus led them to found Malcolm X Liberation University, which aimed to provide an alternative education for Durham's Black residents, including Duke students seeking refuge from a violent campus. And in Nashville in 1970, HBCU faculty and staff founded People's College to teach political and cultural analysis in ways that applied to everyday life. They did so because they saw educating Black people and creating a unique Black culture as essential to building Black nationalism. 23 As the Black Power and Black Arts movements progressed across the South, they increasingly directed their energy toward electoral campaigns as well as the arts and education. In his 1970 \"Coordinator's Statement,\" delivered at the founding convention of the Congress of Afrikan Peoples in Atlanta, Baraka emphasized the importance of voter registration and mobilizing the Black vote. Art played a key part in that effort, with singers like Stevie Wonder, James Brown, and Isaac Hayes supporting Kenneth Gibson's successful 1970 mayoral campaign in Newark. And these electoral victories, as Smethurst notes, also helped the Black Arts Movement by giving \"Black people the administration of political apparatuses with significant control over material resources not before available to Black Power and Black Arts groups.\" 24 Perhaps nowhere was the importance of electoral victories to bolster the Black Arts Movement more on display than in Atlanta. Following his election in 1973, the city's \"culture mayor,\" Maynard Jackson, pledged better funding for the arts. His former speechwriter Michael Lomax led that effort: In 1974 he, the poet Ebon Dooley, and another Jackson campaign staffer and writer, Pearl Cleage, founded the Neighborhood Arts Center, which provided arts education and hosted theater groups in a working-class Black neighborhood. Lomax also helped the writer Toni Cade Bambara secure a position as a writer in residence at Spelman College, another HBCU. In 1975 Jackson appointed Lomax as director of cultural affairs, a position through which he continued financing Black Arts Movement institutions; and in 1978 Bambara, Dooley, and Alice Lovelace founded the Southern Collective of African American Writers, which the Neighborhood Arts Center hosted. In 1979 Lomax helped establish the Fulton County Arts Council, which funded Black Arts Movement organizations throughout the county. By gaining control of the government's spending power through the vote, politicians like Lomax and Jackson, and artists like Bambara and Dooley, developed Atlanta into a hub for radical Black culture. 25 Regional collaborations bolstered these efforts. As the Free Southern Theater and BLKARTSOUTH unraveled in the early 1970s, Dent turned his attention to arts organizations in the South more broadly. He had \"a great dissatisfaction,\" he later recalled, \"with the situation in the early '70s, because I knew that what they were doing in New York was about on the same level with us, but we just didn't have any money.\" Hoping to gain greater recognition and funding, Dent founded the Southern Black Cultural Alliance, which held yearly business meetings at which various organizations could learn from one another how to solve their problems. The alliance also held a yearly conference that brought Black theater troupes and artists across the South to perform. Dent, Salaam, and others then wrote about the conference for a variety of magazines-most notably Hoyt Fuller's Atlanta-based First World , which replaced Black World -as a means of garnering new exposure for their work. By helping artists across the South, the Southern Black Cultural Alliance aided many Black Arts Movement groups in surviving difficult times. 26 Unfortunately, many of these organizations, in Atlanta and in the South more generally, faltered as the federal government scaled back its local funding in the 1980s. In the same year that Ronald Reagan was elected, First World published its final issue. In 1981, when Lomax became chair of the Fulton County Arts Council, the federal government defunded the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act, which had supported many local arts organizations; its 1982 replacement, the Job Placement Training Act, funded far fewer theaters than CETA had. The Reagan administration also provided fewer community block grants, while increasingly conservative Southern state legislatures slashed the funding for Black Arts organizations. Though some managed to persevere, many others had to change their political mission to survive. But as Smethurst reminds his readers, these organizations would have shut down much earlier had they been in other regions; their difficulties in the 1980s after surviving many other conservative turns was less a mark of failure than it was a sign of success. 27 I n Behold the Land , Smethurst demonstrates that decades of organizing and institution building, from the Garveyite years and the Popular Front to the civil rights movement, helped preserve a Black radicalism in the South that eventually became central to the Black Arts Movement in the region. This radicalism was passed on both directly, as when SNYC members published Black Arts writers in Freedomways , and indirectly, as when the Southern Black Cultural Alliance provided a forum for Black Arts Movement workers to collaborate. But in all cases, the Black Arts and Black Power movements were driven by the goal \"to build a new culture of Black cooperation and self-determination.\" Doing so through the arts had the potential to reorient Black political relations toward a collective building of Black autonomy. \"The great strength of Black Arts, its grassroots character, makes it hard to grasp,\" Smethurst observes. \"Black Arts activities and institutions appeared in almost every community and on every campus where there was an appreciable number of Black people.\" By following some of the lines of Black Arts networks, Smethurst gestures toward the broader collaborative endeavors that enabled the movement to gain a foothold in the South and persevere through periods of conservatism. 28 Through interviews conducted with its surviving participants as well as archival research, Smethurst joins scholars like GerShun Avilez and Carter Mathes in revising the canonical understanding of the Black Arts Movement. Where Margo Crawford has argued, in Black Post-Blackness , that the movement foreshadowed contemporary Black artists in their complication of the meanings of Blackness, Smethurst demonstrates that one way that the Black Arts Movement did so was by building institutions that shaped, if not the contemporary artists directly, then the consumers of the art they produce, the venues in which they produce it, and the communities in which they grew up. This aesthetic legacy also bred a political one: The Black Arts Movement laid the foundation for contemporary community arts organizations, for the use of Black art in electoral campaigns, and for arts education as a Black radical, political practice. Though many Black Power organizations eventually folded, the Black Arts Movement helped spread and institutionalize their ideas. 29 This afterlife is especially clear in the long-lasting reach of Southern Black feminism. While scholars like Mary Helen Washington and activists like Mariame Kaba have worked to recover the often neglected history and legacy of midcentury Black radical feminists, Smethurst's account also reminds us of the role of those and other Popular Front radicals in the formation of the Black Arts Movement, especially in the South. Among the SNYC leaders that Smethurst discusses, for instance, was one Alabaman, Sallye Davis. While she worked as a national officer for the SNYC, she was also raising her daughter, Angela, in the intellectual and physical presence of Communist Party members. This early exposure to Marxism, one imagines, influenced not only Angela Davis's great Black Power autobiography, edited by Toni Morrison and published in 1974, but also her intellectual production and anti-carceral radicalism today. 30 In a similar fashion, the legacy of many Southern Black Arts Movement organizations lives on in the present. As Smethurst argues, they helped \"build new African American cultural institutions in historic African American communities that one finds throughout the South today, and the desire to construct networks between these institutions.\" This institutional and coalitional approach ensured that the unraveling of specific institutions did not mark the end of the Black Arts story. If, as Fannie Lou Hamer observed after viewing the Free Southern Theater's production of Waiting for Godot , Black people know something about waiting, they also know something about the long campaign. Liberation may not come tomorrow, but building institutions might mean that freedom can be achieved in the future. 31\n\nS methurst's history begins with Marcus Garvey's early-20th-century Black nationalism and the Black communism of the 1930s, which together, he argues, laid the groundwork for the civil rights, Black Power, and Black Arts movements. In the 1910s and '20s, Garvey pushed for the creation of a nation in Africa to which all the descendants of enslaved people could repatriate.

One cofounder, John O'Neal, encouraged as much when he told the audience, \"You are the actors.\" The theater group may have read the lines and provided the set, but poor Black Southerners were the actual protagonists, and their lives were the central dramatic arc. 15 Like many radical Black organizations in the mid-1960s, the Free Southern Theater eventually moved past the integrationist politics of the early civil rights movement and began to concentrate on developing Black culture. This focus on cultural nationalism was occasioned in part by the arrival in 1965 of Tom Dent, a New Orleans native who had left the South for New York. In his time in the North, Dent had participated in Black cultural and political organizations whose members included Maya Angelou, Ishmael Reed, Amiri Baraka, Harold Cruse, and Archie Shepp. But Dent had grown frustrated with the factionalism of many Black Power and Black Arts Movement activists in New York and decided to return to the Big Easy to help bring their ideas (but not their infighting) home. Once there, Dent soon fell in with the Free Southern Theater, and through his extensive contacts the group garnered new financial, personal, and institutional support. The following year, Dent became chairman of the theater's board and facilitated its move from \"an integrated civil rights institution,\" Smethurst writes, \"to a more self-consciously Black theater with a strong nationalist bent.\" This change meant the departure of the group's white members, but it also provided new possibilities. Under Dent, the Free Southern Theater transitioned \"from civil rights to Black Arts, from Negro to Black, from serving the folk of the Black South to being emphatically southern in a Black modality.\" 16 Organizations across the South followed a similar trajectory. At Howard University in Washington, D.C., the poet Sterling Brown mentored students who became key organizers in SNCC as well as those who became noted Black Power activists, including Stokely Carmichael, and Black Arts Movement writers, such as Baraka and Toni Morrison. Off campus, the poet Gaston Neal used War on Poverty funds to establish the Cardozo Area Arts Committee, which in 1965 started the New School of Afro-American Thought, an education and cultural center that taught literature courses to nearby residents. Its opening event featured Black artists ranging from the Harlem Renaissance to the Black Arts Movement, from Brown to Baraka. In the following years, it hosted many important jazz musicians, including Sun Ra's Arkestra and Joseph Jarman. At another HBCU, Nashville's Fisk University, in 1966, the novelist John Oliver Killens organized the Black Writers Conference. Though Baraka was not among the participants, \"the new militant nationalist writing was a specter haunting the conference,\" Smethurst notes. In time, that specter made itself felt. 17 I n the late 1960s and the early '70s, Black Power radicals and artists opened new institutions and transformed older ones to marry the arts and politics. At the 1967 Black Writers Conference at Fisk, Baraka dominated the proceedings, while several older Black writers, including Gwendolyn Brooks, championed the Black Power and Black Arts movements. That same year, one of Brown's mentees, Charlie Cobb, visited the pan-African Parisian bookstore Présence Africaine, which inspired him to create a Black nationalist bookstore, Drum and Spear, in D.C. with other SNCC alumni in 1968. Another of Brown's mentees, A.B. Spellman, moved from New York to Atlanta, where he joined Morehouse professor Stephen Henderson and the historian Vincent Harding in forming what would become the first Black think tank, the Institute of the Black World, which they founded in 1969. And though the Free Southern Theater stopped its tours that year, in part because of diminished funding, its mission of spreading Black culture and inspiring Black people to create their own cultural institutions was sweeping the South. 18 The assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 and the Black uprisings across the nation that followed pushed these organizers to reconsider the relationship between their institutions and local Black communities. At the newly founded Drum and Spear, Cobb and others hosted political meetings, classes, and readings, including poetry by Gaston Neal. Drum and Spear Press also reprinted C.L.R. James's 1938 A History of Pan-African Revolt and a translated collection of Palestinian poetry, Enemy of the Sun . Elsewhere in the city, James Garrett, whose family had a history of radical organizing and who had helped found the Black studies program at San Francisco State, began running the Black studies department at the newly opened Federal City College. There, he hired Cobb and other SNCC alumni involved with Drum and Spear. As Cobb recalled: 19 The question of black education turned on the question or issue of what you were going to do with your education once you finished.... The question you had to confront as a college student was, \"Upon graduation, how am I going to use my education for the black community?\" 20 Email This pedagogical philosophy reoriented many disciplines, from science to literature, toward practical means of serving Black people. Though clashes with administrators led Garrett and others to leave Federal City College and establish a community school, the Center for Black Education, their new approach to the academy influenced other institutions. 21 Where D.C. became a hub for rethinking Black education, New Orleans served as a locus for rethinking Black art. In 1968, the Tulane Drama Review , edited by onetime Free Southern Theater member Richard Schechner, published its landmark \"Black Theatre\" issue. Among the offerings was Larry Neal's foundational essay \"The Black Arts Movement,\" which described the movement's ongoing efforts as the cultural wing of Black Power. If the Black Arts Movement sought to create culture that aided autonomous political efforts, as Neal suggested, the Free Southern Theater put that theory into practice. At the time, its theater troupe formally separated from the group's writers' workshop, BLKARTSOUTH, then under the leadership of Dent and Kalamu ya Salaam. \"For Black theater to have viability in our communities we must have a working tie to those communities,\" Dent wrote of the group's mission, \"something more than the mere performance of plays now and then.\" Consequently, BLKARTSOUTH was composed entirely of New Orleanians, presented their original work, and primarily cast residents as actors. By valorizing the workshop over the production, BLKARTSOUTH embodied a defining trait of the Black Arts Movement: It valued \"process over product.\" 22 Groups across the South likewise experimented with creating new institutions to develop Black culture and political thought. In 1969, the Institute for the Black World began running seminars in Atlanta. \"We were trying to put forward the idea,\" Vincent Harding later recalled, \"that Black scholarship and Black activism were not meant to be separated...and that all of that should be permeated by the arts as well.\" Members of Duke University's Afro-American Association followed through on Harding's goals in Raleigh-Durham, when protests on campus led them to found Malcolm X Liberation University, which aimed to provide an alternative education for Durham's Black residents, including Duke students seeking refuge from a violent campus. And in Nashville in 1970, HBCU faculty and staff founded People's College to teach political and cultural analysis in ways that applied to everyday life. They did so because they saw educating Black people and creating a unique Black culture as essential to building Black nationalism. 23 As the Black Power and Black Arts movements progressed across the South, they increasingly directed their energy toward electoral campaigns as well as the arts and education. In his 1970 \"Coordinator's Statement,\" delivered at the founding convention of the Congress of Afrikan Peoples in Atlanta, Baraka emphasized the importance of voter registration and mobilizing the Black vote. Art played a key part in that effort, with singers like Stevie Wonder, James Brown, and Isaac Hayes supporting Kenneth Gibson's successful 1970 mayoral campaign in Newark. And these electoral victories, as Smethurst notes, also helped the Black Arts Movement by giving \"Black people the administration of political apparatuses with significant control over material resources not before available to Black Power and Black Arts groups.\" 24 Perhaps nowhere was the importance of electoral victories to bolster the Black Arts Movement more on display than in Atlanta. Following his election in 1973, the city's \"culture mayor,\" Maynard Jackson, pledged better funding for the arts. His former speechwriter Michael Lomax led that effort: In 1974 he, the poet Ebon Dooley, and another Jackson campaign staffer and writer, Pearl Cleage, founded the Neighborhood Arts Center, which provided arts education and hosted theater groups in a working-class Black neighborhood. Lomax also helped the writer Toni Cade Bambara secure a position as a writer in residence at Spelman College, another HBCU. In 1975 Jackson appointed Lomax as director of cultural affairs, a position through which he continued financing Black Arts Movement institutions; and in 1978 Bambara, Dooley, and Alice Lovelace founded the Southern Collective of African American Writers, which the Neighborhood Arts Center hosted. In 1979 Lomax helped establish the Fulton County Arts Council, which funded Black Arts Movement organizations throughout the county. By gaining control of the government's spending power through the vote, politicians like Lomax and Jackson, and artists like Bambara and Dooley, developed Atlanta into a hub for radical Black culture. 25 Regional collaborations bolstered these efforts. As the Free Southern Theater and BLKARTSOUTH unraveled in the early 1970s, Dent turned his attention to arts organizations in the South more broadly. He had \"a great dissatisfaction,\" he later recalled, \"with the situation in the early '70s, because I knew that what they were doing in New York was about on the same level with us, but we just didn't have any money.\" Hoping to gain greater recognition and funding, Dent founded the Southern Black Cultural Alliance, which held yearly business meetings at which various organizations could learn from one another how to solve their problems. The alliance also held a yearly conference that brought Black theater troupes and artists across the South to perform. Dent, Salaam, and others then wrote about the conference for a variety of magazines-most notably Hoyt Fuller's Atlanta-based First World , which replaced Black World -as a means of garnering new exposure for their work. By helping artists across the South, the Southern Black Cultural Alliance aided many Black Arts Movement groups in surviving difficult times. 26 Unfortunately, many of these organizations, in Atlanta and in the South more generally, faltered as the federal government scaled back its local funding in the 1980s. In the same year that Ronald Reagan was elected, First World published its final issue. In 1981, when Lomax became chair of the Fulton County Arts Council, the federal government defunded the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act, which had supported many local arts organizations; its 1982 replacement, the Job Placement Training Act, funded far fewer theaters than CETA had. The Reagan administration also provided fewer community block grants, while increasingly conservative Southern state legislatures slashed the funding for Black Arts organizations. Though some managed to persevere, many others had to change their political mission to survive. But as Smethurst reminds his readers, these organizations would have shut down much earlier had they been in other regions; their difficulties in the 1980s after surviving many other conservative turns was less a mark of failure than it was a sign of success. 27 I n Behold the Land , Smethurst demonstrates that decades of organizing and institution building, from the Garveyite years and the Popular Front to the civil rights movement, helped preserve a Black radicalism in the South that eventually became central to the Black Arts Movement in the region. This radicalism was passed on both directly, as when SNYC members published Black Arts writers in Freedomways , and indirectly, as when the Southern Black Cultural Alliance provided a forum for Black Arts Movement workers to collaborate. But in all cases, the Black Arts and Black Power movements were driven by the goal \"to build a new culture of Black cooperation and self-determination.\" Doing so through the arts had the potential to reorient Black political relations toward a collective building of Black autonomy. \"The great strength of Black Arts, its grassroots character, makes it hard to grasp,\" Smethurst observes. \"Black Arts activities and institutions appeared in almost every community and on every campus where there was an appreciable number of Black people.\" By following some of the lines of Black Arts networks, Smethurst gestures toward the broader collaborative endeavors that enabled the movement to gain a foothold in the South and persevere through periods of conservatism. 28 Through interviews conducted with its surviving participants as well as archival research, Smethurst joins scholars like GerShun Avilez and Carter Mathes in revising the canonical understanding of the Black Arts Movement. Where Margo Crawford has argued, in Black Post-Blackness , that the movement foreshadowed contemporary Black artists in their complication of the meanings of Blackness, Smethurst demonstrates that one way that the Black Arts Movement did so was by building institutions that shaped, if not the contemporary artists directly, then the consumers of the art they produce, the venues in which they produce it, and the communities in which they grew up. This aesthetic legacy also bred a political one: The Black Arts Movement laid the foundation for contemporary community arts organizations, for the use of Black art in electoral campaigns, and for arts education as a Black radical, political practice. Though many Black Power organizations eventually folded, the Black Arts Movement helped spread and institutionalize their ideas. 29 This afterlife is especially clear in the long-lasting reach of Southern Black feminism. While scholars like Mary Helen Washington and activists like Mariame Kaba have worked to recover the often neglected history and legacy of midcentury Black radical feminists, Smethurst's account also reminds us of the role of those and other Popular Front radicals in the formation of the Black Arts Movement, especially in the South. Among the SNYC leaders that Smethurst discusses, for instance, was one Alabaman, Sallye Davis. While she worked as a national officer for the SNYC, she was also raising her daughter, Angela, in the intellectual and physical presence of Communist Party members. This early exposure to Marxism, one imagines, influenced not only Angela Davis's great Black Power autobiography, edited by Toni Morrison and published in 1974, but also her intellectual production and anti-carceral radicalism today. 30 In a similar fashion, the legacy of many Southern Black Arts Movement organizations lives on in the present. As Smethurst argues, they helped \"build new African American cultural institutions in historic African American communities that one finds throughout the South today, and the desire to construct networks between these institutions.\" This institutional and coalitional approach ensured that the unraveling of specific institutions did not mark the end of the Black Arts story. If, as Fannie Lou Hamer observed after viewing the Free Southern Theater's production of Waiting for Godot , Black people know something about waiting, they also know something about the long campaign. Liberation may not come tomorrow, but building institutions might mean that freedom can be achieved in the future. 31\n\nGarveyism declined in the late 1920s, after Garvey's 1927 deportation to Jamaica. In its wake, many UNIA members flocked to the Communist Party, which became increasingly prominent in Black politics, especially in the South, where the struggle against the Depression and segregation attracted many new members to the party and its subsidiary organizations. Art as well as labor politics were central sites for Black and white Communists organizing in the South. 9 Eventually headquartered in Birmingham, Ala., a Communist Party stronghold, the Southern Negro Youth Congress was founded in 1937 both to pursue revolutionary change and to promote Black art. The SNYC's Puppet Caravan Theatre performed plays about labor and voting rights for Southern farmworkers. It also provided political experience for activists like Ernest Wright, who helped lead the People's Defense League in New Orleans, which marched for jobs and the right to vote and against police brutality. 10 Elsewhere in New Orleans, the Dillard History Unit, founded in 1936 and funded by the Federal Writers' Project, employed the novelist Margaret Walker and contributed to the history The Negro in Louisiana . And in Atlanta in 1942, the visual artist and professor Hale Woodruff joined W.E.B. Du Bois at Atlanta University's People's School in creating a program to educate local adults. In these and other organizations, Smethurst writes, the cross-organizational politics rooted in the Communist Party \"became the most viable space for building radical African American institutions with a bent toward Black self-determination in most of the South.\" 11 McCarthyism and the Second Red Scare resulted in the persecution of leftists in the early postwar years, but many of these Black cultural workers continued to be active in their communities. In 1941, John Biggers enrolled at the Hampton Institute in Virginia, where he was taught by Elizabeth Catlett, who had worked with the Dillard History Unit. In 1949, Biggers joined Texas Southern University, one of the nation's historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), as head of the art department, where he pushed students and instructors to interact with local Black communities. In the 1950s, he began painting murals in poor Black areas in Houston. Biggers was not alone in his persistence: Organizers like Anne and Carl Braden in Kentucky and writers like Sterling Brown in Washington, D.C., continued the project of keeping radical ideas and Black organizing alive in a time of segregation and anti-communist repression. 12 The Black radicalism that informed the Communist Party and many of its subsidiary groups in the South also provided an impetus for Black activism in an era in which the civil rights movement was heating up. In 1949, the demise of the SNYC led several members, including Esther Cooper Jackson, to move north to work for Paul Robeson's Black Marxist newspaper Freedom (where a young Lorraine Hansberry also worked). In 1955, Freedom succumbed to a lack of funding, in part because potential donors feared FBI harassment (and rightfully so, since the bureau was known to have photographed the license plates of those who attended Robeson's concerts). But in 1961, Jackson and other former SNYC leaders started the journal Freedomways , which repurposed 1930s radicalism and socialism for the ascendant civil rights movement. Freedomways published older Black radicals like Shirley Graham Du Bois, rising stars like Audre Lorde, and Black nationalists like Sonia Sanchez. In Smethurst's words, Freedomways \"served as a model of what a radical Black political and cultural journal that embodied the principle of self-determination might be...and practically supported the work and institutions of younger Black artists and intellectuals.\" In so doing, Freedomways created a bridge between different generations of the South's Black left and helped to lay the foundations for a new era of social activism and radical arts. 13 T he South proved to be an especially fertile ground from which civil rights organizers were able to harvest the fruit of seeds sown by past radical movements. In the 1960s, the region was home to about half of all Black Americans living in the United States. It hosted a large consortium of HBCUs, which provided shelter for teachers who might have fallen victim to anti-communism at other institutions. And the South provided a home base for SNCC, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and many of the other best-known civil rights groups and organizers. \"By the early 1960s,\" Smethurst writes, \"the South was the terrain of the most vibrant and diverse grassroots Black political activity in the United States, ranging from direct action nonviolent protest to actual armed self-defense.\" 14 Amid the tumult of the civil rights movement, Black artists sought out new means of making their work relevant to Black politics. In 1964, two members of SNCC's literacy project and a journalist employed by the Mississippi Free Press put their interest in theater to good use by forming the Free Southern Theater. Conceived as a cultural wing of SNCC, the group offered a writing workshop and staged drama for Black Southerners out of its base at Tougaloo College, until police harassment forced it to move to New Orleans. Though rehearsed, the Free Southern Theater's productions required improvisation because Black Southerners often interacted with the performers, including on one occasion when an audience member stood onstage for much of the play. One cofounder, John O'Neal, encouraged as much when he told the audience, \"You are the actors.\" The theater group may have read the lines and provided the set, but poor Black Southerners were the actual protagonists, and their lives were the central dramatic arc. 15 Like many radical Black organizations in the mid-1960s, the Free Southern Theater eventually moved past the integrationist politics of the early civil rights movement and began to concentrate on developing Black culture.

In these and other organizations, Smethurst writes, the cross-organizational politics rooted in the Communist Party \"became the most viable space for building radical African American institutions with a bent toward Black self-determination in most of the South.\" 11 McCarthyism and the Second Red Scare resulted in the persecution of leftists in the early postwar years, but many of these Black cultural workers continued to be active in their communities. In 1941, John Biggers enrolled at the Hampton Institute in Virginia, where he was taught by Elizabeth Catlett, who had worked with the Dillard History Unit. In 1949, Biggers joined Texas Southern University, one of the nation's historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), as head of the art department, where he pushed students and instructors to interact with local Black communities. In the 1950s, he began painting murals in poor Black areas in Houston. Biggers was not alone in his persistence: Organizers like Anne and Carl Braden in Kentucky and writers like Sterling Brown in Washington, D.C., continued the project of keeping radical ideas and Black organizing alive in a time of segregation and anti-communist repression. 12 The Black radicalism that informed the Communist Party and many of its subsidiary groups in the South also provided an impetus for Black activism in an era in which the civil rights movement was heating up. In 1949, the demise of the SNYC led several members, including Esther Cooper Jackson, to move north to work for Paul Robeson's Black Marxist newspaper Freedom (where a young Lorraine Hansberry also worked). In 1955, Freedom succumbed to a lack of funding, in part because potential donors feared FBI harassment (and rightfully so, since the bureau was known to have photographed the license plates of those who attended Robeson's concerts). But in 1961, Jackson and other former SNYC leaders started the journal Freedomways , which repurposed 1930s radicalism and socialism for the ascendant civil rights movement. Freedomways published older Black radicals like Shirley Graham Du Bois, rising stars like Audre Lorde, and Black nationalists like Sonia Sanchez. In Smethurst's words, Freedomways \"served as a model of what a radical Black political and cultural journal that embodied the principle of self-determination might be...and practically supported the work and institutions of younger Black artists and intellectuals.\" In so doing, Freedomways created a bridge between different generations of the South's Black left and helped to lay the foundations for a new era of social activism and radical arts. 13 T he South proved to be an especially fertile ground from which civil rights organizers were able to harvest the fruit of seeds sown by past radical movements. In the 1960s, the region was home to about half of all Black Americans living in the United States. It hosted a large consortium of HBCUs, which provided shelter for teachers who might have fallen victim to anti-communism at other institutions. And the South provided a home base for SNCC, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and many of the other best-known civil rights groups and organizers. \"By the early 1960s,\" Smethurst writes, \"the South was the terrain of the most vibrant and diverse grassroots Black political activity in the United States, ranging from direct action nonviolent protest to actual armed self-defense.\" 14 Amid the tumult of the civil rights movement, Black artists sought out new means of making their work relevant to Black politics. In 1964, two members of SNCC's literacy project and a journalist employed by the Mississippi Free Press put their interest in theater to good use by forming the Free Southern Theater. Conceived as a cultural wing of SNCC, the group offered a writing workshop and staged drama for Black Southerners out of its base at Tougaloo College, until police harassment forced it to move to New Orleans. Though rehearsed, the Free Southern Theater's productions required improvisation because Black Southerners often interacted with the performers, including on one occasion when an audience member stood onstage for much of the play. One cofounder, John O'Neal, encouraged as much when he told the audience, \"You are the actors.\" The theater group may have read the lines and provided the set, but poor Black Southerners were the actual protagonists, and their lives were the central dramatic arc. 15 Like many radical Black organizations in the mid-1960s, the Free Southern Theater eventually moved past the integrationist politics of the early civil rights movement and began to concentrate on developing Black culture. This focus on cultural nationalism was occasioned in part by the arrival in 1965 of Tom Dent, a New Orleans native who had left the South for New York. In his time in the North, Dent had participated in Black cultural and political organizations whose members included Maya Angelou, Ishmael Reed, Amiri Baraka, Harold Cruse, and Archie Shepp. But Dent had grown frustrated with the factionalism of many Black Power and Black Arts Movement activists in New York and decided to return to the Big Easy to help bring their ideas (but not their infighting) home. Once there, Dent soon fell in with the Free Southern Theater, and through his extensive contacts the group garnered new financial, personal, and institutional support. The following year, Dent became chairman of the theater's board and facilitated its move from \"an integrated civil rights institution,\" Smethurst writes, \"to a more self-consciously Black theater with a strong nationalist bent.\" This change meant the departure of the group's white members, but it also provided new possibilities. Under Dent, the Free Southern Theater transitioned \"from civil rights to Black Arts, from Negro to Black, from serving the folk of the Black South to being emphatically southern in a Black modality.\" 16 Organizations across the South followed a similar trajectory. At Howard University in Washington, D.C., the poet Sterling Brown mentored students who became key organizers in SNCC as well as those who became noted Black Power activists, including Stokely Carmichael, and Black Arts Movement writers, such as Baraka and Toni Morrison. Off campus, the poet Gaston Neal used War on Poverty funds to establish the Cardozo Area Arts Committee, which in 1965 started the New School of Afro-American Thought, an education and cultural center that taught literature courses to nearby residents. Its opening event featured Black artists ranging from the Harlem Renaissance to the Black Arts Movement, from Brown to Baraka. In the following years, it hosted many important jazz musicians, including Sun Ra's Arkestra and Joseph Jarman. At another HBCU, Nashville's Fisk University, in 1966, the novelist John Oliver Killens organized the Black Writers Conference. Though Baraka was not among the participants, \"the new militant nationalist writing was a specter haunting the conference,\" Smethurst notes. In time, that specter made itself felt. 17 I n the late 1960s and the early '70s, Black Power radicals and artists opened new institutions and transformed older ones to marry the arts and politics. At the 1967 Black Writers Conference at Fisk, Baraka dominated the proceedings, while several older Black writers, including Gwendolyn Brooks, championed the Black Power and Black Arts movements. That same year, one of Brown's mentees, Charlie Cobb, visited the pan-African Parisian bookstore Présence Africaine, which inspired him to create a Black nationalist bookstore, Drum and Spear, in D.C. with other SNCC alumni in 1968. Another of Brown's mentees, A.B. Spellman, moved from New York to Atlanta, where he joined Morehouse professor Stephen Henderson and the historian Vincent Harding in forming what would become the first Black think tank, the Institute of the Black World, which they founded in 1969. And though the Free Southern Theater stopped its tours that year, in part because of diminished funding, its mission of spreading Black culture and inspiring Black people to create their own cultural institutions was sweeping the South. 18 The assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 and the Black uprisings across the nation that followed pushed these organizers to reconsider the relationship between their institutions and local Black communities. At the newly founded Drum and Spear, Cobb and others hosted political meetings, classes, and readings, including poetry by Gaston Neal. Drum and Spear Press also reprinted C.L.R. James's 1938 A History of Pan-African Revolt and a translated collection of Palestinian poetry, Enemy of the Sun . Elsewhere in the city, James Garrett, whose family had a history of radical organizing and who had helped found the Black studies program at San Francisco State, began running the Black studies department at the newly opened Federal City College. There, he hired Cobb and other SNCC alumni involved with Drum and Spear. As Cobb recalled: 19 The question of black education turned on the question or issue of what you were going to do with your education once you finished.... The question you had to confront as a college student was, \"Upon graduation, how am I going to use my education for the black community?\" 20 Email This pedagogical philosophy reoriented many disciplines, from science to literature, toward practical means of serving Black people. Though clashes with administrators led Garrett and others to leave Federal City College and establish a community school, the Center for Black Education, their new approach to the academy influenced other institutions. 21 Where D.C. became a hub for rethinking Black education, New Orleans served as a locus for rethinking Black art. In 1968, the Tulane Drama Review , edited by onetime Free Southern Theater member Richard Schechner, published its landmark \"Black Theatre\" issue. Among the offerings was Larry Neal's foundational essay \"The Black Arts Movement,\" which described the movement's ongoing efforts as the cultural wing of Black Power. If the Black Arts Movement sought to create culture that aided autonomous political efforts, as Neal suggested, the Free Southern Theater put that theory into practice. At the time, its theater troupe formally separated from the group's writers' workshop, BLKARTSOUTH, then under the leadership of Dent and Kalamu ya Salaam. \"For Black theater to have viability in our communities we must have a working tie to those communities,\" Dent wrote of the group's mission, \"something more than the mere performance of plays now and then.\" Consequently, BLKARTSOUTH was composed entirely of New Orleanians, presented their original work, and primarily cast residents as actors. By valorizing the workshop over the production, BLKARTSOUTH embodied a defining trait of the Black Arts Movement: It valued \"process over product.\" 22 Groups across the South likewise experimented with creating new institutions to develop Black culture and political thought. In 1969, the Institute for the Black World began running seminars in Atlanta. \"We were trying to put forward the idea,\" Vincent Harding later recalled, \"that Black scholarship and Black activism were not meant to be separated...and that all of that should be permeated by the arts as well.\" Members of Duke University's Afro-American Association followed through on Harding's goals in Raleigh-Durham, when protests on campus led them to found Malcolm X Liberation University, which aimed to provide an alternative education for Durham's Black residents, including Duke students seeking refuge from a violent campus. And in Nashville in 1970, HBCU faculty and staff founded People's College to teach political and cultural analysis in ways that applied to everyday life. They did so because they saw educating Black people and creating a unique Black culture as essential to building Black nationalism. 23 As the Black Power and Black Arts movements progressed across the South, they increasingly directed their energy toward electoral campaigns as well as the arts and education. In his 1970 \"Coordinator's Statement,\" delivered at the founding convention of the Congress of Afrikan Peoples in Atlanta, Baraka emphasized the importance of voter registration and mobilizing the Black vote. Art played a key part in that effort, with singers like Stevie Wonder, James Brown, and Isaac Hayes supporting Kenneth Gibson's successful 1970 mayoral campaign in Newark. And these electoral victories, as Smethurst notes, also helped the Black Arts Movement by giving \"Black people the administration of political apparatuses with significant control over material resources not before available to Black Power and Black Arts groups.\" 24 Perhaps nowhere was the importance of electoral victories to bolster the Black Arts Movement more on display than in Atlanta. Following his election in 1973, the city's \"culture mayor,\" Maynard Jackson, pledged better funding for the arts. His former speechwriter Michael Lomax led that effort: In 1974 he, the poet Ebon Dooley, and another Jackson campaign staffer and writer, Pearl Cleage, founded the Neighborhood Arts Center, which provided arts education and hosted theater groups in a working-class Black neighborhood. Lomax also helped the writer Toni Cade Bambara secure a position as a writer in residence at Spelman College, another HBCU. In 1975 Jackson appointed Lomax as director of cultural affairs, a position through which he continued financing Black Arts Movement institutions; and in 1978 Bambara, Dooley, and Alice Lovelace founded the Southern Collective of African American Writers, which the Neighborhood Arts Center hosted. In 1979 Lomax helped establish the Fulton County Arts Council, which funded Black Arts Movement organizations throughout the county. By gaining control of the government's spending power through the vote, politicians like Lomax and Jackson, and artists like Bambara and Dooley, developed Atlanta into a hub for radical Black culture. 25 Regional collaborations bolstered these efforts. As the Free Southern Theater and BLKARTSOUTH unraveled in the early 1970s, Dent turned his attention to arts organizations in the South more broadly. He had \"a great dissatisfaction,\" he later recalled, \"with the situation in the early '70s, because I knew that what they were doing in New York was about on the same level with us, but we just didn't have any money.\" Hoping to gain greater recognition and funding, Dent founded the Southern Black Cultural Alliance, which held yearly business meetings at which various organizations could learn from one another how to solve their problems. The alliance also held a yearly conference that brought Black theater troupes and artists across the South to perform. Dent, Salaam, and others then wrote about the conference for a variety of magazines-most notably Hoyt Fuller's Atlanta-based First World , which replaced Black World -as a means of garnering new exposure for their work. By helping artists across the South, the Southern Black Cultural Alliance aided many Black Arts Movement groups in surviving difficult times. 26 Unfortunately, many of these organizations, in Atlanta and in the South more generally, faltered as the federal government scaled back its local funding in the 1980s. In the same year that Ronald Reagan was elected, First World published its final issue. In 1981, when Lomax became chair of the Fulton County Arts Council, the federal government defunded the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act, which had supported many local arts organizations; its 1982 replacement, the Job Placement Training Act, funded far fewer theaters than CETA had. The Reagan administration also provided fewer community block grants, while increasingly conservative Southern state legislatures slashed the funding for Black Arts organizations. Though some managed to persevere, many others had to change their political mission to survive. But as Smethurst reminds his readers, these organizations would have shut down much earlier had they been in other regions; their difficulties in the 1980s after surviving many other conservative turns was less a mark of failure than it was a sign of success. 27 I n Behold the Land , Smethurst demonstrates that decades of organizing and institution building, from the Garveyite years and the Popular Front to the civil rights movement, helped preserve a Black radicalism in the South that eventually became central to the Black Arts Movement in the region. This radicalism was passed on both directly, as when SNYC members published Black Arts writers in Freedomways , and indirectly, as when the Southern Black Cultural Alliance provided a forum for Black Arts Movement workers to collaborate. But in all cases, the Black Arts and Black Power movements were driven by the goal \"to build a new culture of Black cooperation and self-determination.\" Doing so through the arts had the potential to reorient Black political relations toward a collective building of Black autonomy. \"The great strength of Black Arts, its grassroots character, makes it hard to grasp,\" Smethurst observes. \"Black Arts activities and institutions appeared in almost every community and on every campus where there was an appreciable number of Black people.\" By following some of the lines of Black Arts networks, Smethurst gestures toward the broader collaborative endeavors that enabled the movement to gain a foothold in the South and persevere through periods of conservatism. 28 Through interviews conducted with its surviving participants as well as archival research, Smethurst joins scholars like GerShun Avilez and Carter Mathes in revising the canonical understanding of the Black Arts Movement. Where Margo Crawford has argued, in Black Post-Blackness , that the movement foreshadowed contemporary Black artists in their complication of the meanings of Blackness, Smethurst demonstrates that one way that the Black Arts Movement did so was by building institutions that shaped, if not the contemporary artists directly, then the consumers of the art they produce, the venues in which they produce it, and the communities in which they grew up. This aesthetic legacy also bred a political one: The Black Arts Movement laid the foundation for contemporary community arts organizations, for the use of Black art in electoral campaigns, and for arts education as a Black radical, political practice. Though many Black Power organizations eventually folded, the Black Arts Movement helped spread and institutionalize their ideas. 29 This afterlife is especially clear in the long-lasting reach of Southern Black feminism. While scholars like Mary Helen Washington and activists like Mariame Kaba have worked to recover the often neglected history and legacy of midcentury Black radical feminists, Smethurst's account also reminds us of the role of those and other Popular Front radicals in the formation of the Black Arts Movement, especially in the South. Among the SNYC leaders that Smethurst discusses, for instance, was one Alabaman, Sallye Davis. While she worked as a national officer for the SNYC, she was also raising her daughter, Angela, in the intellectual and physical presence of Communist Party members. This early exposure to Marxism, one imagines, influenced not only Angela Davis's great Black Power autobiography, edited by Toni Morrison and published in 1974, but also her intellectual production and anti-carceral radicalism today. 30 In a similar fashion, the legacy of many Southern Black Arts Movement organizations lives on in the present. As Smethurst argues, they helped \"build new African American cultural institutions in historic African American communities that one finds throughout the South today, and the desire to construct networks between these institutions.\" This institutional and coalitional approach ensured that the unraveling of specific institutions did not mark the end of the Black Arts story. If, as Fannie Lou Hamer observed after viewing the Free Southern Theater's production of Waiting for Godot , Black people know something about waiting, they also know something about the long campaign. Liberation may not come tomorrow, but building institutions might mean that freedom can be achieved in the future. 31\n\nElsewhere in New Orleans, the Dillard History Unit, founded in 1936 and funded by the Federal Writers' Project, employed the novelist Margaret Walker and contributed to the history The Negro in Louisiana . And in Atlanta in 1942, the visual artist and professor Hale Woodruff joined W.E.B. Du Bois at Atlanta University's People's School in creating a program to educate local adults. In these and other organizations, Smethurst writes, the cross-organizational politics rooted in the Communist Party \"became the most viable space for building radical African American institutions with a bent toward Black self-determination in most of the South.\" 11 McCarthyism and the Second Red Scare resulted in the persecution of leftists in the early postwar years, but many of these Black cultural workers continued to be active in their communities. In 1941, John Biggers enrolled at the Hampton Institute in Virginia, where he was taught by Elizabeth Catlett, who had worked with the Dillard History Unit. In 1949, Biggers joined Texas Southern University, one of the nation's historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), as head of the art department, where he pushed students and instructors to interact with local Black communities.

But in 1961, Jackson and other former SNYC leaders started the journal Freedomways , which repurposed 1930s radicalism and socialism for the ascendant civil rights movement. Freedomways published older Black radicals like Shirley Graham Du Bois, rising stars like Audre Lorde, and Black nationalists like Sonia Sanchez. In Smethurst's words, Freedomways \"served as a model of what a radical Black political and cultural journal that embodied the principle of self-determination might be...and practically supported the work and institutions of younger Black artists and intellectuals.\" In so doing, Freedomways created a bridge between different generations of the South's Black left and helped to lay the foundations for a new era of social activism and radical arts. 13 T he South proved to be an especially fertile ground from which civil rights organizers were able to harvest the fruit of seeds sown by past radical movements.

Where Margo Crawford has argued, in Black Post-Blackness , that the movement foreshadowed contemporary Black artists in their complication of the meanings of Blackness, Smethurst demonstrates that one way that the Black Arts Movement did so was by building institutions that shaped, if not the contemporary artists directly, then the consumers of the art they produce, the venues in which they produce it, and the communities in which they grew up. This aesthetic legacy also bred a political one: The Black Arts Movement laid the foundation for contemporary community arts organizations, for the use of Black art in electoral campaigns, and for arts education as a Black radical, political practice. Though many Black Power organizations eventually folded, the Black Arts Movement helped spread and institutionalize their ideas. 29 This afterlife is especially clear in the long-lasting reach of Southern Black feminism. While scholars like Mary Helen Washington and activists like Mariame Kaba have worked to recover the often neglected history and legacy of midcentury Black radical feminists, Smethurst's account also reminds us of the role of those and other Popular Front radicals in the formation of the Black Arts Movement, especially in the South. Among the SNYC leaders that Smethurst discusses, for instance, was one Alabaman, Sallye Davis. While she worked as a national officer for the SNYC, she was also raising her daughter, Angela, in the intellectual and physical presence of Communist Party members. This early exposure to Marxism, one imagines, influenced not only Angela Davis's great Black Power autobiography, edited by Toni Morrison and published in 1974, but also her intellectual production and anti-carceral radicalism today. 30 In a similar fashion, the legacy of many Southern Black Arts Movement organizations lives on in the present. As Smethurst argues, they helped \"build new African American cultural institutions in historic African American communities that one finds throughout the South today, and the desire to construct networks between these institutions.\" This institutional and coalitional approach ensured that the unraveling of specific institutions did not mark the end of the Black Arts story. If, as Fannie Lou Hamer observed after viewing the Free Southern Theater's production of Waiting for Godot , Black people know something about waiting, they also know something about the long campaign. Liberation may not come tomorrow, but building institutions might mean that freedom can be achieved in the future. 31\n\nMcCarthyism and the Second Red Scare resulted in the persecution of leftists in the early postwar years, but many of these Black cultural workers continued to be active in their communities. In 1941, John Biggers enrolled at the Hampton Institute in Virginia, where he was taught by Elizabeth Catlett, who had worked with the Dillard History Unit. In 1949, Biggers joined Texas Southern University, one of the nation's historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), as head of the art department, where he pushed students and instructors to interact with local Black communities. In the 1950s, he began painting murals in poor Black areas in Houston. Biggers was not alone in his persistence: Organizers like Anne and Carl Braden in Kentucky and writers like Sterling Brown in Washington, D.C., continued the project of keeping radical ideas and Black organizing alive in a time of segregation and anti-communist repression. 12 The Black radicalism that informed the Communist Party and many of its subsidiary groups in the South also provided an impetus for Black activism in an era in which the civil rights movement was heating up. In 1949, the demise of the SNYC led several members, including Esther Cooper Jackson, to move north to work for Paul Robeson's Black Marxist newspaper Freedom (where a young Lorraine Hansberry also worked). In 1955, Freedom succumbed to a lack of funding, in part because potential donors feared FBI harassment (and rightfully so, since the bureau was known to have photographed the license plates of those who attended Robeson's concerts). But in 1961, Jackson and other former SNYC leaders started the journal Freedomways , which repurposed 1930s radicalism and socialism for the ascendant civil rights movement. Freedomways published older Black radicals like Shirley Graham Du Bois, rising stars like Audre Lorde, and Black nationalists like Sonia Sanchez. In Smethurst's words, Freedomways \"served as a model of what a radical Black political and cultural journal that embodied the principle of self-determination might be...and practically supported the work and institutions of younger Black artists and intellectuals.\" In so doing, Freedomways created a bridge between different generations of the South's Black left and helped to lay the foundations for a new era of social activism and radical arts. 13 T he South proved to be an especially fertile ground from which civil rights organizers were able to harvest the fruit of seeds sown by past radical movements. In the 1960s, the region was home to about half of all Black Americans living in the United States. It hosted a large consortium of HBCUs, which provided shelter for teachers who might have fallen victim to anti-communism at other institutions. And the South provided a home base for SNCC, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and many of the other best-known civil rights groups and organizers. \"By the early 1960s,\" Smethurst writes, \"the South was the terrain of the most vibrant and diverse grassroots Black political activity in the United States, ranging from direct action nonviolent protest to actual armed self-defense.\" 14 Amid the tumult of the civil rights movement, Black artists sought out new means of making their work relevant to Black politics. In 1964, two members of SNCC's literacy project and a journalist employed by the Mississippi Free Press put their interest in theater to good use by forming the Free Southern Theater. Conceived as a cultural wing of SNCC, the group offered a writing workshop and staged drama for Black Southerners out of its base at Tougaloo College, until police harassment forced it to move to New Orleans. Though rehearsed, the Free Southern Theater's productions required improvisation because Black Southerners often interacted with the performers, including on one occasion when an audience member stood onstage for much of the play. One cofounder, John O'Neal, encouraged as much when he told the audience, \"You are the actors.\" The theater group may have read the lines and provided the set, but poor Black Southerners were the actual protagonists, and their lives were the central dramatic arc. 15 Like many radical Black organizations in the mid-1960s, the Free Southern Theater eventually moved past the integrationist politics of the early civil rights movement and began to concentrate on developing Black culture. This focus on cultural nationalism was occasioned in part by the arrival in 1965 of Tom Dent, a New Orleans native who had left the South for New York. In his time in the North, Dent had participated in Black cultural and political organizations whose members included Maya Angelou, Ishmael Reed, Amiri Baraka, Harold Cruse, and Archie Shepp. But Dent had grown frustrated with the factionalism of many Black Power and Black Arts Movement activists in New York and decided to return to the Big Easy to help bring their ideas (but not their infighting) home. Once there, Dent soon fell in with the Free Southern Theater, and through his extensive contacts the group garnered new financial, personal, and institutional support. The following year, Dent became chairman of the theater's board and facilitated its move from \"an integrated civil rights institution,\" Smethurst writes, \"to a more self-consciously Black theater with a strong nationalist bent.\" This change meant the departure of the group's white members, but it also provided new possibilities. Under Dent, the Free Southern Theater transitioned \"from civil rights to Black Arts, from Negro to Black, from serving the folk of the Black South to being emphatically southern in a Black modality.\" 16 Organizations across the South followed a similar trajectory. At Howard University in Washington, D.C., the poet Sterling Brown mentored students who became key organizers in SNCC as well as those who became noted Black Power activists, including Stokely Carmichael, and Black Arts Movement writers, such as Baraka and Toni Morrison. Off campus, the poet Gaston Neal used War on Poverty funds to establish the Cardozo Area Arts Committee, which in 1965 started the New School of Afro-American Thought, an education and cultural center that taught literature courses to nearby residents. Its opening event featured Black artists ranging from the Harlem Renaissance to the Black Arts Movement, from Brown to Baraka. In the following years, it hosted many important jazz musicians, including Sun Ra's Arkestra and Joseph Jarman. At another HBCU, Nashville's Fisk University, in 1966, the novelist John Oliver Killens organized the Black Writers Conference. Though Baraka was not among the participants, \"the new militant nationalist writing was a specter haunting the conference,\" Smethurst notes. In time, that specter made itself felt. 17 I n the late 1960s and the early '70s, Black Power radicals and artists opened new institutions and transformed older ones to marry the arts and politics. At the 1967 Black Writers Conference at Fisk, Baraka dominated the proceedings, while several older Black writers, including Gwendolyn Brooks, championed the Black Power and Black Arts movements. That same year, one of Brown's mentees, Charlie Cobb, visited the pan-African Parisian bookstore Présence Africaine, which inspired him to create a Black nationalist bookstore, Drum and Spear, in D.C. with other SNCC alumni in 1968. Another of Brown's mentees, A.B. Spellman, moved from New York to Atlanta, where he joined Morehouse professor Stephen Henderson and the historian Vincent Harding in forming what would become the first Black think tank, the Institute of the Black World, which they founded in 1969. And though the Free Southern Theater stopped its tours that year, in part because of diminished funding, its mission of spreading Black culture and inspiring Black people to create their own cultural institutions was sweeping the South. 18 The assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 and the Black uprisings across the nation that followed pushed these organizers to reconsider the relationship between their institutions and local Black communities. At the newly founded Drum and Spear, Cobb and others hosted political meetings, classes, and readings, including poetry by Gaston Neal. Drum and Spear Press also reprinted C.L.R. James's 1938 A History of Pan-African Revolt and a translated collection of Palestinian poetry, Enemy of the Sun . Elsewhere in the city, James Garrett, whose family had a history of radical organizing and who had helped found the Black studies program at San Francisco State, began running the Black studies department at the newly opened Federal City College. There, he hired Cobb and other SNCC alumni involved with Drum and Spear. As Cobb recalled: 19 The question of black education turned on the question or issue of what you were going to do with your education once you finished.... The question you had to confront as a college student was, \"Upon graduation, how am I going to use my education for the black community?\" 20 Email This pedagogical philosophy reoriented many disciplines, from science to literature, toward practical means of serving Black people. Though clashes with administrators led Garrett and others to leave Federal City College and establish a community school, the Center for Black Education, their new approach to the academy influenced other institutions. 21 Where D.C. became a hub for rethinking Black education, New Orleans served as a locus for rethinking Black art. In 1968, the Tulane Drama Review , edited by onetime Free Southern Theater member Richard Schechner, published its landmark \"Black Theatre\" issue. Among the offerings was Larry Neal's foundational essay \"The Black Arts Movement,\" which described the movement's ongoing efforts as the cultural wing of Black Power. If the Black Arts Movement sought to create culture that aided autonomous political efforts, as Neal suggested, the Free Southern Theater put that theory into practice. At the time, its theater troupe formally separated from the group's writers' workshop, BLKARTSOUTH, then under the leadership of Dent and Kalamu ya Salaam. \"For Black theater to have viability in our communities we must have a working tie to those communities,\" Dent wrote of the group's mission, \"something more than the mere performance of plays now and then.\" Consequently, BLKARTSOUTH was composed entirely of New Orleanians, presented their original work, and primarily cast residents as actors. By valorizing the workshop over the production, BLKARTSOUTH embodied a defining trait of the Black Arts Movement: It valued \"process over product.\" 22 Groups across the South likewise experimented with creating new institutions to develop Black culture and political thought. In 1969, the Institute for the Black World began running seminars in Atlanta. \"We were trying to put forward the idea,\" Vincent Harding later recalled, \"that Black scholarship and Black activism were not meant to be separated...and that all of that should be permeated by the arts as well.\" Members of Duke University's Afro-American Association followed through on Harding's goals in Raleigh-Durham, when protests on campus led them to found Malcolm X Liberation University, which aimed to provide an alternative education for Durham's Black residents, including Duke students seeking refuge from a violent campus. And in Nashville in 1970, HBCU faculty and staff founded People's College to teach political and cultural analysis in ways that applied to everyday life. They did so because they saw educating Black people and creating a unique Black culture as essential to building Black nationalism. 23 As the Black Power and Black Arts movements progressed across the South, they increasingly directed their energy toward electoral campaigns as well as the arts and education. In his 1970 \"Coordinator's Statement,\" delivered at the founding convention of the Congress of Afrikan Peoples in Atlanta, Baraka emphasized the importance of voter registration and mobilizing the Black vote. Art played a key part in that effort, with singers like Stevie Wonder, James Brown, and Isaac Hayes supporting Kenneth Gibson's successful 1970 mayoral campaign in Newark. And these electoral victories, as Smethurst notes, also helped the Black Arts Movement by giving \"Black people the administration of political apparatuses with significant control over material resources not before available to Black Power and Black Arts groups.\" 24 Perhaps nowhere was the importance of electoral victories to bolster the Black Arts Movement more on display than in Atlanta. Following his election in 1973, the city's \"culture mayor,\" Maynard Jackson, pledged better funding for the arts. His former speechwriter Michael Lomax led that effort: In 1974 he, the poet Ebon Dooley, and another Jackson campaign staffer and writer, Pearl Cleage, founded the Neighborhood Arts Center, which provided arts education and hosted theater groups in a working-class Black neighborhood. Lomax also helped the writer Toni Cade Bambara secure a position as a writer in residence at Spelman College, another HBCU. In 1975 Jackson appointed Lomax as director of cultural affairs, a position through which he continued financing Black Arts Movement institutions; and in 1978 Bambara, Dooley, and Alice Lovelace founded the Southern Collective of African American Writers, which the Neighborhood Arts Center hosted. In 1979 Lomax helped establish the Fulton County Arts Council, which funded Black Arts Movement organizations throughout the county. By gaining control of the government's spending power through the vote, politicians like Lomax and Jackson, and artists like Bambara and Dooley, developed Atlanta into a hub for radical Black culture. 25 Regional collaborations bolstered these efforts. As the Free Southern Theater and BLKARTSOUTH unraveled in the early 1970s, Dent turned his attention to arts organizations in the South more broadly. He had \"a great dissatisfaction,\" he later recalled, \"with the situation in the early '70s, because I knew that what they were doing in New York was about on the same level with us, but we just didn't have any money.\" Hoping to gain greater recognition and funding, Dent founded the Southern Black Cultural Alliance, which held yearly business meetings at which various organizations could learn from one another how to solve their problems. The alliance also held a yearly conference that brought Black theater troupes and artists across the South to perform. Dent, Salaam, and others then wrote about the conference for a variety of magazines-most notably Hoyt Fuller's Atlanta-based First World , which replaced Black World -as a means of garnering new exposure for their work. By helping artists across the South, the Southern Black Cultural Alliance aided many Black Arts Movement groups in surviving difficult times. 26 Unfortunately, many of these organizations, in Atlanta and in the South more generally, faltered as the federal government scaled back its local funding in the 1980s. In the same year that Ronald Reagan was elected, First World published its final issue. In 1981, when Lomax became chair of the Fulton County Arts Council, the federal government defunded the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act, which had supported many local arts organizations; its 1982 replacement, the Job Placement Training Act, funded far fewer theaters than CETA had. The Reagan administration also provided fewer community block grants, while increasingly conservative Southern state legislatures slashed the funding for Black Arts organizations. Though some managed to persevere, many others had to change their political mission to survive. But as Smethurst reminds his readers, these organizations would have shut down much earlier had they been in other regions; their difficulties in the 1980s after surviving many other conservative turns was less a mark of failure than it was a sign of success. 27 I n Behold the Land , Smethurst demonstrates that decades of organizing and institution building, from the Garveyite years and the Popular Front to the civil rights movement, helped preserve a Black radicalism in the South that eventually became central to the Black Arts Movement in the region. This radicalism was passed on both directly, as when SNYC members published Black Arts writers in Freedomways , and indirectly, as when the Southern Black Cultural Alliance provided a forum for Black Arts Movement workers to collaborate. But in all cases, the Black Arts and Black Power movements were driven by the goal \"to build a new culture of Black cooperation and self-determination.\" Doing so through the arts had the potential to reorient Black political relations toward a collective building of Black autonomy. \"The great strength of Black Arts, its grassroots character, makes it hard to grasp,\" Smethurst observes. \"Black Arts activities and institutions appeared in almost every community and on every campus where there was an appreciable number of Black people.\" By following some of the lines of Black Arts networks, Smethurst gestures toward the broader collaborative endeavors that enabled the movement to gain a foothold in the South and persevere through periods of conservatism. 28 Through interviews conducted with its surviving participants as well as archival research, Smethurst joins scholars like GerShun Avilez and Carter Mathes in revising the canonical understanding of the Black Arts Movement.

This radicalism was passed on both directly, as when SNYC members published Black Arts writers in Freedomways , and indirectly, as when the Southern Black Cultural Alliance provided a forum for Black Arts Movement workers to collaborate. But in all cases, the Black Arts and Black Power movements were driven by the goal \"to build a new culture of Black cooperation and self-determination.\" Doing so through the arts had the potential to reorient Black political relations toward a collective building of Black autonomy. \"The great strength of Black Arts, its grassroots character, makes it hard to grasp,\" Smethurst observes. \"Black Arts activities and institutions appeared in almost every community and on every campus where there was an appreciable number of Black people.\" By following some of the lines of Black Arts networks, Smethurst gestures toward the broader collaborative endeavors that enabled the movement to gain a foothold in the South and persevere through periods of conservatism. 28 Through interviews conducted with its surviving participants as well as archival research, Smethurst joins scholars like GerShun Avilez and Carter Mathes in revising the canonical understanding of the Black Arts Movement. Where Margo Crawford has argued, in Black Post-Blackness , that the movement foreshadowed contemporary Black artists in their complication of the meanings of Blackness, Smethurst demonstrates that one way that the Black Arts Movement did so was by building institutions that shaped, if not the contemporary artists directly, then the consumers of the art they produce, the venues in which they produce it, and the communities in which they grew up. This aesthetic legacy also bred a political one: The Black Arts Movement laid the foundation for contemporary community arts organizations, for the use of Black art in electoral campaigns, and for arts education as a Black radical, political practice. Though many Black Power organizations eventually folded, the Black Arts Movement helped spread and institutionalize their ideas. 29 This afterlife is especially clear in the long-lasting reach of Southern Black feminism. While scholars like Mary Helen Washington and activists like Mariame Kaba have worked to recover the often neglected history and legacy of midcentury Black radical feminists, Smethurst's account also reminds us of the role of those and other Popular Front radicals in the formation of the Black Arts Movement, especially in the South. Among the SNYC leaders that Smethurst discusses, for instance, was one Alabaman, Sallye Davis. While she worked as a national officer for the SNYC, she was also raising her daughter, Angela, in the intellectual and physical presence of Communist Party members. This early exposure to Marxism, one imagines, influenced not only Angela Davis's great Black Power autobiography, edited by Toni Morrison and published in 1974, but also her intellectual production and anti-carceral radicalism today. 30 In a similar fashion, the legacy of many Southern Black Arts Movement organizations lives on in the present. As Smethurst argues, they helped \"build new African American cultural institutions in historic African American communities that one finds throughout the South today, and the desire to construct networks between these institutions.\" This institutional and coalitional approach ensured that the unraveling of specific institutions did not mark the end of the Black Arts story. If, as Fannie Lou Hamer observed after viewing the Free Southern Theater's production of Waiting for Godot , Black people know something about waiting, they also know something about the long campaign. Liberation may not come tomorrow, but building institutions might mean that freedom can be achieved in the future. 31\n\nT he South proved to be an especially fertile ground from which civil rights organizers were able to harvest the fruit of seeds sown by past radical movements. In the 1960s, the region was home to about half of all Black Americans living in the United States. It hosted a large consortium of HBCUs, which provided shelter for teachers who might have fallen victim to anti-communism at other institutions. And the South provided a home base for SNCC, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and many of the other best-known civil rights groups and organizers. \"By the early 1960s,\" Smethurst writes, \"the South was the terrain of the most vibrant and diverse grassroots Black political activity in the United States, ranging from direct action nonviolent protest to actual armed self-defense.\" 14 Amid the tumult of the civil rights movement, Black artists sought out new means of making their work relevant to Black politics. In 1964, two members of SNCC's literacy project and a journalist employed by the Mississippi Free Press put their interest in theater to good use by forming the Free Southern Theater. Conceived as a cultural wing of SNCC, the group offered a writing workshop and staged drama for Black Southerners out of its base at Tougaloo College, until police harassment forced it to move to New Orleans. Though rehearsed, the Free Southern Theater's productions required improvisation because Black Southerners often interacted with the performers, including on one occasion when an audience member stood onstage for much of the play. One cofounder, John O'Neal, encouraged as much when he told the audience, \"You are the actors.\" The theater group may have read the lines and provided the set, but poor Black Southerners were the actual protagonists, and their lives were the central dramatic arc. 15 Like many radical Black organizations in the mid-1960s, the Free Southern Theater eventually moved past the integrationist politics of the early civil rights movement and began to concentrate on developing Black culture. This focus on cultural nationalism was occasioned in part by the arrival in 1965 of Tom Dent, a New Orleans native who had left the South for New York. In his time in the North, Dent had participated in Black cultural and political organizations whose members included Maya Angelou, Ishmael Reed, Amiri Baraka, Harold Cruse, and Archie Shepp. But Dent had grown frustrated with the factionalism of many Black Power and Black Arts Movement activists in New York and decided to return to the Big Easy to help bring their ideas (but not their infighting) home. Once there, Dent soon fell in with the Free Southern Theater, and through his extensive contacts the group garnered new financial, personal, and institutional support. The following year, Dent became chairman of the theater's board and facilitated its move from \"an integrated civil rights institution,\" Smethurst writes, \"to a more self-consciously Black theater with a strong nationalist bent.\" This change meant the departure of the group's white members, but it also provided new possibilities. Under Dent, the Free Southern Theater transitioned \"from civil rights to Black Arts, from Negro to Black, from serving the folk of the Black South to being emphatically southern in a Black modality.\" 16 Organizations across the South followed a similar trajectory. At Howard University in Washington, D.C., the poet Sterling Brown mentored students who became key organizers in SNCC as well as those who became noted Black Power activists, including Stokely Carmichael, and Black Arts Movement writers, such as Baraka and Toni Morrison. Off campus, the poet Gaston Neal used War on Poverty funds to establish the Cardozo Area Arts Committee, which in 1965 started the New School of Afro-American Thought, an education and cultural center that taught literature courses to nearby residents. Its opening event featured Black artists ranging from the Harlem Renaissance to the Black Arts Movement, from Brown to Baraka. In the following years, it hosted many important jazz musicians, including Sun Ra's Arkestra and Joseph Jarman. At another HBCU, Nashville's Fisk University, in 1966, the novelist John Oliver Killens organized the Black Writers Conference. Though Baraka was not among the participants, \"the new militant nationalist writing was a specter haunting the conference,\" Smethurst notes. In time, that specter made itself felt. 17 I n the late 1960s and the early '70s, Black Power radicals and artists opened new institutions and transformed older ones to marry the arts and politics. At the 1967 Black Writers Conference at Fisk, Baraka dominated the proceedings, while several older Black writers, including Gwendolyn Brooks, championed the Black Power and Black Arts movements. That same year, one of Brown's mentees, Charlie Cobb, visited the pan-African Parisian bookstore Présence Africaine, which inspired him to create a Black nationalist bookstore, Drum and Spear, in D.C. with other SNCC alumni in 1968. Another of Brown's mentees, A.B. Spellman, moved from New York to Atlanta, where he joined Morehouse professor Stephen Henderson and the historian Vincent Harding in forming what would become the first Black think tank, the Institute of the Black World, which they founded in 1969. And though the Free Southern Theater stopped its tours that year, in part because of diminished funding, its mission of spreading Black culture and inspiring Black people to create their own cultural institutions was sweeping the South. 18 The assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 and the Black uprisings across the nation that followed pushed these organizers to reconsider the relationship between their institutions and local Black communities. At the newly founded Drum and Spear, Cobb and others hosted political meetings, classes, and readings, including poetry by Gaston Neal. Drum and Spear Press also reprinted C.L.R. James's 1938 A History of Pan-African Revolt and a translated collection of Palestinian poetry, Enemy of the Sun . Elsewhere in the city, James Garrett, whose family had a history of radical organizing and who had helped found the Black studies program at San Francisco State, began running the Black studies department at the newly opened Federal City College. There, he hired Cobb and other SNCC alumni involved with Drum and Spear. As Cobb recalled: 19 The question of black education turned on the question or issue of what you were going to do with your education once you finished.... The question you had to confront as a college student was, \"Upon graduation, how am I going to use my education for the black community?\" 20 Email This pedagogical philosophy reoriented many disciplines, from science to literature, toward practical means of serving Black people. Though clashes with administrators led Garrett and others to leave Federal City College and establish a community school, the Center for Black Education, their new approach to the academy influenced other institutions. 21 Where D.C. became a hub for rethinking Black education, New Orleans served as a locus for rethinking Black art. In 1968, the Tulane Drama Review , edited by onetime Free Southern Theater member Richard Schechner, published its landmark \"Black Theatre\" issue. Among the offerings was Larry Neal's foundational essay \"The Black Arts Movement,\" which described the movement's ongoing efforts as the cultural wing of Black Power. If the Black Arts Movement sought to create culture that aided autonomous political efforts, as Neal suggested, the Free Southern Theater put that theory into practice. At the time, its theater troupe formally separated from the group's writers' workshop, BLKARTSOUTH, then under the leadership of Dent and Kalamu ya Salaam. \"For Black theater to have viability in our communities we must have a working tie to those communities,\" Dent wrote of the group's mission, \"something more than the mere performance of plays now and then.\" Consequently, BLKARTSOUTH was composed entirely of New Orleanians, presented their original work, and primarily cast residents as actors. By valorizing the workshop over the production, BLKARTSOUTH embodied a defining trait of the Black Arts Movement: It valued \"process over product.\" 22 Groups across the South likewise experimented with creating new institutions to develop Black culture and political thought. In 1969, the Institute for the Black World began running seminars in Atlanta. \"We were trying to put forward the idea,\" Vincent Harding later recalled, \"that Black scholarship and Black activism were not meant to be separated...and that all of that should be permeated by the arts as well.\" Members of Duke University's Afro-American Association followed through on Harding's goals in Raleigh-Durham, when protests on campus led them to found Malcolm X Liberation University, which aimed to provide an alternative education for Durham's Black residents, including Duke students seeking refuge from a violent campus. And in Nashville in 1970, HBCU faculty and staff founded People's College to teach political and cultural analysis in ways that applied to everyday life. They did so because they saw educating Black people and creating a unique Black culture as essential to building Black nationalism. 23 As the Black Power and Black Arts movements progressed across the South, they increasingly directed their energy toward electoral campaigns as well as the arts and education. In his 1970 \"Coordinator's Statement,\" delivered at the founding convention of the Congress of Afrikan Peoples in Atlanta, Baraka emphasized the importance of voter registration and mobilizing the Black vote. Art played a key part in that effort, with singers like Stevie Wonder, James Brown, and Isaac Hayes supporting Kenneth Gibson's successful 1970 mayoral campaign in Newark. And these electoral victories, as Smethurst notes, also helped the Black Arts Movement by giving \"Black people the administration of political apparatuses with significant control over material resources not before available to Black Power and Black Arts groups.\" 24 Perhaps nowhere was the importance of electoral victories to bolster the Black Arts Movement more on display than in Atlanta. Following his election in 1973, the city's \"culture mayor,\" Maynard Jackson, pledged better funding for the arts. His former speechwriter Michael Lomax led that effort: In 1974 he, the poet Ebon Dooley, and another Jackson campaign staffer and writer, Pearl Cleage, founded the Neighborhood Arts Center, which provided arts education and hosted theater groups in a working-class Black neighborhood. Lomax also helped the writer Toni Cade Bambara secure a position as a writer in residence at Spelman College, another HBCU. In 1975 Jackson appointed Lomax as director of cultural affairs, a position through which he continued financing Black Arts Movement institutions; and in 1978 Bambara, Dooley, and Alice Lovelace founded the Southern Collective of African American Writers, which the Neighborhood Arts Center hosted. In 1979 Lomax helped establish the Fulton County Arts Council, which funded Black Arts Movement organizations throughout the county. By gaining control of the government's spending power through the vote, politicians like Lomax and Jackson, and artists like Bambara and Dooley, developed Atlanta into a hub for radical Black culture. 25 Regional collaborations bolstered these efforts. As the Free Southern Theater and BLKARTSOUTH unraveled in the early 1970s, Dent turned his attention to arts organizations in the South more broadly. He had \"a great dissatisfaction,\" he later recalled, \"with the situation in the early '70s, because I knew that what they were doing in New York was about on the same level with us, but we just didn't have any money.\" Hoping to gain greater recognition and funding, Dent founded the Southern Black Cultural Alliance, which held yearly business meetings at which various organizations could learn from one another how to solve their problems. The alliance also held a yearly conference that brought Black theater troupes and artists across the South to perform. Dent, Salaam, and others then wrote about the conference for a variety of magazines-most notably Hoyt Fuller's Atlanta-based First World , which replaced Black World -as a means of garnering new exposure for their work. By helping artists across the South, the Southern Black Cultural Alliance aided many Black Arts Movement groups in surviving difficult times. 26 Unfortunately, many of these organizations, in Atlanta and in the South more generally, faltered as the federal government scaled back its local funding in the 1980s. In the same year that Ronald Reagan was elected, First World published its final issue. In 1981, when Lomax became chair of the Fulton County Arts Council, the federal government defunded the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act, which had supported many local arts organizations; its 1982 replacement, the Job Placement Training Act, funded far fewer theaters than CETA had. The Reagan administration also provided fewer community block grants, while increasingly conservative Southern state legislatures slashed the funding for Black Arts organizations. Though some managed to persevere, many others had to change their political mission to survive. But as Smethurst reminds his readers, these organizations would have shut down much earlier had they been in other regions; their difficulties in the 1980s after surviving many other conservative turns was less a mark of failure than it was a sign of success. 27 I n Behold the Land , Smethurst demonstrates that decades of organizing and institution building, from the Garveyite years and the Popular Front to the civil rights movement, helped preserve a Black radicalism in the South that eventually became central to the Black Arts Movement in the region.

This radicalism was passed on both directly, as when SNYC members published Black Arts writers in Freedomways , and indirectly, as when the Southern Black Cultural Alliance provided a forum for Black Arts Movement workers to collaborate. But in all cases, the Black Arts and Black Power movements were driven by the goal \"to build a new culture of Black cooperation and self-determination.\" Doing so through the arts had the potential to reorient Black political relations toward a collective building of Black autonomy. \"The great strength of Black Arts, its grassroots character, makes it hard to grasp,\" Smethurst observes. \"Black Arts activities and institutions appeared in almost every community and on every campus where there was an appreciable number of Black people.\" By following some of the lines of Black Arts networks, Smethurst gestures toward the broader collaborative endeavors that enabled the movement to gain a foothold in the South and persevere through periods of conservatism. 28 Through interviews conducted with its surviving participants as well as archival research, Smethurst joins scholars like GerShun Avilez and Carter Mathes in revising the canonical understanding of the Black Arts Movement. Where Margo Crawford has argued, in Black Post-Blackness , that the movement foreshadowed contemporary Black artists in their complication of the meanings of Blackness, Smethurst demonstrates that one way that the Black Arts Movement did so was by building institutions that shaped, if not the contemporary artists directly, then the consumers of the art they produce, the venues in which they produce it, and the communities in which they grew up. This aesthetic legacy also bred a political one: The Black Arts Movement laid the foundation for contemporary community arts organizations, for the use of Black art in electoral campaigns, and for arts education as a Black radical, political practice. Though many Black Power organizations eventually folded, the Black Arts Movement helped spread and institutionalize their ideas. 29 This afterlife is especially clear in the long-lasting reach of Southern Black feminism. While scholars like Mary Helen Washington and activists like Mariame Kaba have worked to recover the often neglected history and legacy of midcentury Black radical feminists, Smethurst's account also reminds us of the role of those and other Popular Front radicals in the formation of the Black Arts Movement, especially in the South. Among the SNYC leaders that Smethurst discusses, for instance, was one Alabaman, Sallye Davis. While she worked as a national officer for the SNYC, she was also raising her daughter, Angela, in the intellectual and physical presence of Communist Party members. This early exposure to Marxism, one imagines, influenced not only Angela Davis's great Black Power autobiography, edited by Toni Morrison and published in 1974, but also her intellectual production and anti-carceral radicalism today. 30 In a similar fashion, the legacy of many Southern Black Arts Movement organizations lives on in the present. As Smethurst argues, they helped \"build new African American cultural institutions in historic African American communities that one finds throughout the South today, and the desire to construct networks between these institutions.\" This institutional and coalitional approach ensured that the unraveling of specific institutions did not mark the end of the Black Arts story. If, as Fannie Lou Hamer observed after viewing the Free Southern Theater's production of Waiting for Godot , Black people know something about waiting, they also know something about the long campaign. Liberation may not come tomorrow, but building institutions might mean that freedom can be achieved in the future. 31\n\nLike many radical Black organizations in the mid-1960s, the Free Southern Theater eventually moved past the integrationist politics of the early civil rights movement and began to concentrate on developing Black culture. This focus on cultural nationalism was occasioned in part by the arrival in 1965 of Tom Dent, a New Orleans native who had left the South for New York. In his time in the North, Dent had participated in Black cultural and political organizations whose members included Maya Angelou, Ishmael Reed, Amiri Baraka, Harold Cruse, and Archie Shepp. But Dent had grown frustrated with the factionalism of many Black Power and Black Arts Movement activists in New York and decided to return to the Big Easy to help bring their ideas (but not their infighting) home. Once there, Dent soon fell in with the Free Southern Theater, and through his extensive contacts the group garnered new financial, personal, and institutional support. The following year, Dent became chairman of the theater's board and facilitated its move from \"an integrated civil rights institution,\" Smethurst writes, \"to a more self-consciously Black theater with a strong nationalist bent.\" This change meant the departure of the group's white members, but it also provided new possibilities. Under Dent, the Free Southern Theater transitioned \"from civil rights to Black Arts, from Negro to Black, from serving the folk of the Black South to being emphatically southern in a Black modality.\" 16 Organizations across the South followed a similar trajectory. At Howard University in Washington, D.C., the poet Sterling Brown mentored students who became key organizers in SNCC as well as those who became noted Black Power activists, including Stokely Carmichael, and Black Arts Movement writers, such as Baraka and Toni Morrison. Off campus, the poet Gaston Neal used War on Poverty funds to establish the Cardozo Area Arts Committee, which in 1965 started the New School of Afro-American Thought, an education and cultural center that taught literature courses to nearby residents. Its opening event featured Black artists ranging from the Harlem Renaissance to the Black Arts Movement, from Brown to Baraka. In the following years, it hosted many important jazz musicians, including Sun Ra's Arkestra and Joseph Jarman. At another HBCU, Nashville's Fisk University, in 1966, the novelist John Oliver Killens organized the Black Writers Conference. Though Baraka was not among the participants, \"the new militant nationalist writing was a specter haunting the conference,\" Smethurst notes. In time, that specter made itself felt. 17 I n the late 1960s and the early '70s, Black Power radicals and artists opened new institutions and transformed older ones to marry the arts and politics. At the 1967 Black Writers Conference at Fisk, Baraka dominated the proceedings, while several older Black writers, including Gwendolyn Brooks, championed the Black Power and Black Arts movements. That same year, one of Brown's mentees, Charlie Cobb, visited the pan-African Parisian bookstore Présence Africaine, which inspired him to create a Black nationalist bookstore, Drum and Spear, in D.C. with other SNCC alumni in 1968. Another of Brown's mentees, A.B. Spellman, moved from New York to Atlanta, where he joined Morehouse professor Stephen Henderson and the historian Vincent Harding in forming what would become the first Black think tank, the Institute of the Black World, which they founded in 1969. And though the Free Southern Theater stopped its tours that year, in part because of diminished funding, its mission of spreading Black culture and inspiring Black people to create their own cultural institutions was sweeping the South. 18 The assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 and the Black uprisings across the nation that followed pushed these organizers to reconsider the relationship between their institutions and local Black communities. At the newly founded Drum and Spear, Cobb and others hosted political meetings, classes, and readings, including poetry by Gaston Neal. Drum and Spear Press also reprinted C.L.R. James's 1938 A History of Pan-African Revolt and a translated collection of Palestinian poetry, Enemy of the Sun . Elsewhere in the city, James Garrett, whose family had a history of radical organizing and who had helped found the Black studies program at San Francisco State, began running the Black studies department at the newly opened Federal City College. There, he hired Cobb and other SNCC alumni involved with Drum and Spear. As Cobb recalled: 19 The question of black education turned on the question or issue of what you were going to do with your education once you finished.... The question you had to confront as a college student was, \"Upon graduation, how am I going to use my education for the black community?\" 20 Email This pedagogical philosophy reoriented many disciplines, from science to literature, toward practical means of serving Black people. Though clashes with administrators led Garrett and others to leave Federal City College and establish a community school, the Center for Black Education, their new approach to the academy influenced other institutions. 21 Where D.C. became a hub for rethinking Black education, New Orleans served as a locus for rethinking Black art. In 1968, the Tulane Drama Review , edited by onetime Free Southern Theater member Richard Schechner, published its landmark \"Black Theatre\" issue. Among the offerings was Larry Neal's foundational essay \"The Black Arts Movement,\" which described the movement's ongoing efforts as the cultural wing of Black Power. If the Black Arts Movement sought to create culture that aided autonomous political efforts, as Neal suggested, the Free Southern Theater put that theory into practice. At the time, its theater troupe formally separated from the group's writers' workshop, BLKARTSOUTH, then under the leadership of Dent and Kalamu ya Salaam. \"For Black theater to have viability in our communities we must have a working tie to those communities,\" Dent wrote of the group's mission, \"something more than the mere performance of plays now and then.\" Consequently, BLKARTSOUTH was composed entirely of New Orleanians, presented their original work, and primarily cast residents as actors. By valorizing the workshop over the production, BLKARTSOUTH embodied a defining trait of the Black Arts Movement: It valued \"process over product.\" 22 Groups across the South likewise experimented with creating new institutions to develop Black culture and political thought. In 1969, the Institute for the Black World began running seminars in Atlanta. \"We were trying to put forward the idea,\" Vincent Harding later recalled, \"that Black scholarship and Black activism were not meant to be separated...and that all of that should be permeated by the arts as well.\" Members of Duke University's Afro-American Association followed through on Harding's goals in Raleigh-Durham, when protests on campus led them to found Malcolm X Liberation University, which aimed to provide an alternative education for Durham's Black residents, including Duke students seeking refuge from a violent campus. And in Nashville in 1970, HBCU faculty and staff founded People's College to teach political and cultural analysis in ways that applied to everyday life. They did so because they saw educating Black people and creating a unique Black culture as essential to building Black nationalism. 23 As the Black Power and Black Arts movements progressed across the South, they increasingly directed their energy toward electoral campaigns as well as the arts and education. In his 1970 \"Coordinator's Statement,\" delivered at the founding convention of the Congress of Afrikan Peoples in Atlanta, Baraka emphasized the importance of voter registration and mobilizing the Black vote. Art played a key part in that effort, with singers like Stevie Wonder, James Brown, and Isaac Hayes supporting Kenneth Gibson's successful 1970 mayoral campaign in Newark. And these electoral victories, as Smethurst notes, also helped the Black Arts Movement by giving \"Black people the administration of political apparatuses with significant control over material resources not before available to Black Power and Black Arts groups.\" 24 Perhaps nowhere was the importance of electoral victories to bolster the Black Arts Movement more on display than in Atlanta. Following his election in 1973, the city's \"culture mayor,\" Maynard Jackson, pledged better funding for the arts. His former speechwriter Michael Lomax led that effort: In 1974 he, the poet Ebon Dooley, and another Jackson campaign staffer and writer, Pearl Cleage, founded the Neighborhood Arts Center, which provided arts education and hosted theater groups in a working-class Black neighborhood. Lomax also helped the writer Toni Cade Bambara secure a position as a writer in residence at Spelman College, another HBCU. In 1975 Jackson appointed Lomax as director of cultural affairs, a position through which he continued financing Black Arts Movement institutions; and in 1978 Bambara, Dooley, and Alice Lovelace founded the Southern Collective of African American Writers, which the Neighborhood Arts Center hosted. In 1979 Lomax helped establish the Fulton County Arts Council, which funded Black Arts Movement organizations throughout the county. By gaining control of the government's spending power through the vote, politicians like Lomax and Jackson, and artists like Bambara and Dooley, developed Atlanta into a hub for radical Black culture. 25 Regional collaborations bolstered these efforts. As the Free Southern Theater and BLKARTSOUTH unraveled in the early 1970s, Dent turned his attention to arts organizations in the South more broadly. He had \"a great dissatisfaction,\" he later recalled, \"with the situation in the early '70s, because I knew that what they were doing in New York was about on the same level with us, but we just didn't have any money.\" Hoping to gain greater recognition and funding, Dent founded the Southern Black Cultural Alliance, which held yearly business meetings at which various organizations could learn from one another how to solve their problems. The alliance also held a yearly conference that brought Black theater troupes and artists across the South to perform. Dent, Salaam, and others then wrote about the conference for a variety of magazines-most notably Hoyt Fuller's Atlanta-based First World , which replaced Black World -as a means of garnering new exposure for their work. By helping artists across the South, the Southern Black Cultural Alliance aided many Black Arts Movement groups in surviving difficult times. 26 Unfortunately, many of these organizations, in Atlanta and in the South more generally, faltered as the federal government scaled back its local funding in the 1980s. In the same year that Ronald Reagan was elected, First World published its final issue. In 1981, when Lomax became chair of the Fulton County Arts Council, the federal government defunded the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act, which had supported many local arts organizations; its 1982 replacement, the Job Placement Training Act, funded far fewer theaters than CETA had. The Reagan administration also provided fewer community block grants, while increasingly conservative Southern state legislatures slashed the funding for Black Arts organizations. Though some managed to persevere, many others had to change their political mission to survive. But as Smethurst reminds his readers, these organizations would have shut down much earlier had they been in other regions; their difficulties in the 1980s after surviving many other conservative turns was less a mark of failure than it was a sign of success. 27 I n Behold the Land , Smethurst demonstrates that decades of organizing and institution building, from the Garveyite years and the Popular Front to the civil rights movement, helped preserve a Black radicalism in the South that eventually became central to the Black Arts Movement in the region. This radicalism was passed on both directly, as when SNYC members published Black Arts writers in Freedomways , and indirectly, as when the Southern Black Cultural Alliance provided a forum for Black Arts Movement workers to collaborate. But in all cases, the Black Arts and Black Power movements were driven by the goal \"to build a new culture of Black cooperation and self-determination.\" Doing so through the arts had the potential to reorient Black political relations toward a collective building of Black autonomy. \"The great strength of Black Arts, its grassroots character, makes it hard to grasp,\" Smethurst observes. \"Black Arts activities and institutions appeared in almost every community and on every campus where there was an appreciable number of Black people.\" By following some of the lines of Black Arts networks, Smethurst gestures toward the broader collaborative endeavors that enabled the movement to gain a foothold in the South and persevere through periods of conservatism. 28 Through interviews conducted with its surviving participants as well as archival research, Smethurst joins scholars like GerShun Avilez and Carter Mathes in revising the canonical understanding of the Black Arts Movement. Where Margo Crawford has argued, in Black Post-Blackness , that the movement foreshadowed contemporary Black artists in their complication of the meanings of Blackness, Smethurst demonstrates that one way that the Black Arts Movement did so was by building institutions that shaped, if not the contemporary artists directly, then the consumers of the art they produce, the venues in which they produce it, and the communities in which they grew up. This aesthetic legacy also bred a political one: The Black Arts Movement laid the foundation for contemporary community arts organizations, for the use of Black art in electoral campaigns, and for arts education as a Black radical, political practice. Though many Black Power organizations eventually folded, the Black Arts Movement helped spread and institutionalize their ideas. 29 This afterlife is especially clear in the long-lasting reach of Southern Black feminism. While scholars like Mary Helen Washington and activists like Mariame Kaba have worked to recover the often neglected history and legacy of midcentury Black radical feminists, Smethurst's account also reminds us of the role of those and other Popular Front radicals in the formation of the Black Arts Movement, especially in the South. Among the SNYC leaders that Smethurst discusses, for instance, was one Alabaman, Sallye Davis. While she worked as a national officer for the SNYC, she was also raising her daughter, Angela, in the intellectual and physical presence of Communist Party members. This early exposure to Marxism, one imagines, influenced not only Angela Davis's great Black Power autobiography, edited by Toni Morrison and published in 1974, but also her intellectual production and anti-carceral radicalism today. 30 In a similar fashion, the legacy of many Southern Black Arts Movement organizations lives on in the present. As Smethurst argues, they helped \"build new African American cultural institutions in historic African American communities that one finds throughout the South today, and the desire to construct networks between these institutions.\" This institutional and coalitional approach ensured that the unraveling of specific institutions did not mark the end of the Black Arts story. If, as Fannie Lou Hamer observed after viewing the Free Southern Theater's production of Waiting for Godot , Black people know something about waiting, they also know something about the long campaign. Liberation may not come tomorrow, but building institutions might mean that freedom can be achieved in the future. 31\n\nOrganizations across the South followed a similar trajectory.

But as Smethurst reminds his readers, these organizations would have shut down much earlier had they been in other regions; their difficulties in the 1980s after surviving many other conservative turns was less a mark of failure than it was a sign of success. 27 I n Behold the Land , Smethurst demonstrates that decades of organizing and institution building, from the Garveyite years and the Popular Front to the civil rights movement, helped preserve a Black radicalism in the South that eventually became central to the Black Arts Movement in the region. This radicalism was passed on both directly, as when SNYC members published Black Arts writers in Freedomways , and indirectly, as when the Southern Black Cultural Alliance provided a forum for Black Arts Movement workers to collaborate. But in all cases, the Black Arts and Black Power movements were driven by the goal \"to build a new culture of Black cooperation and self-determination.\" Doing so through the arts had the potential to reorient Black political relations toward a collective building of Black autonomy. \"The great strength of Black Arts, its grassroots character, makes it hard to grasp,\" Smethurst observes. \"Black Arts activities and institutions appeared in almost every community and on every campus where there was an appreciable number of Black people.\" By following some of the lines of Black Arts networks, Smethurst gestures toward the broader collaborative endeavors that enabled the movement to gain a foothold in the South and persevere through periods of conservatism. 28 Through interviews conducted with its surviving participants as well as archival research, Smethurst joins scholars like GerShun Avilez and Carter Mathes in revising the canonical understanding of the Black Arts Movement. Where Margo Crawford has argued, in Black Post-Blackness , that the movement foreshadowed contemporary Black artists in their complication of the meanings of Blackness, Smethurst demonstrates that one way that the Black Arts Movement did so was by building institutions that shaped, if not the contemporary artists directly, then the consumers of the art they produce, the venues in which they produce it, and the communities in which they grew up. This aesthetic legacy also bred a political one: The Black Arts Movement laid the foundation for contemporary community arts organizations, for the use of Black art in electoral campaigns, and for arts education as a Black radical, political practice. Though many Black Power organizations eventually folded, the Black Arts Movement helped spread and institutionalize their ideas. 29 This afterlife is especially clear in the long-lasting reach of Southern Black feminism. While scholars like Mary Helen Washington and activists like Mariame Kaba have worked to recover the often neglected history and legacy of midcentury Black radical feminists, Smethurst's account also reminds us of the role of those and other Popular Front radicals in the formation of the Black Arts Movement, especially in the South. Among the SNYC leaders that Smethurst discusses, for instance, was one Alabaman, Sallye Davis. While she worked as a national officer for the SNYC, she was also raising her daughter, Angela, in the intellectual and physical presence of Communist Party members. This early exposure to Marxism, one imagines, influenced not only Angela Davis's great Black Power autobiography, edited by Toni Morrison and published in 1974, but also her intellectual production and anti-carceral radicalism today. 30 In a similar fashion, the legacy of many Southern Black Arts Movement organizations lives on in the present. As Smethurst argues, they helped \"build new African American cultural institutions in historic African American communities that one finds throughout the South today, and the desire to construct networks between these institutions.\" This institutional and coalitional approach ensured that the unraveling of specific institutions did not mark the end of the Black Arts story. If, as Fannie Lou Hamer observed after viewing the Free Southern Theater's production of Waiting for Godot , Black people know something about waiting, they also know something about the long campaign. Liberation may not come tomorrow, but building institutions might mean that freedom can be achieved in the future. 31\n\nThe assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 and the Black uprisings across the nation that followed pushed these organizers to reconsider the relationship between their institutions and local Black communities. At the newly founded Drum and Spear, Cobb and others hosted political meetings, classes, and readings, including poetry by Gaston Neal. Drum and Spear Press also reprinted C.L.R. James's 1938 A History of Pan-African Revolt and a translated collection of Palestinian poetry, Enemy of the Sun . Elsewhere in the city, James Garrett, whose family had a history of radical organizing and who had helped found the Black studies program at San Francisco State, began running the Black studies department at the newly opened Federal City College. There, he hired Cobb and other SNCC alumni involved with Drum and Spear. As Cobb recalled: 19 The question of black education turned on the question or issue of what you were going to do with your education once you finished.... The question you had to confront as a college student was, \"Upon graduation, how am I going to use my education for the black community?\" 20 Email This pedagogical philosophy reoriented many disciplines, from science to literature, toward practical means of serving Black people. Though clashes with administrators led Garrett and others to leave Federal City College and establish a community school, the Center for Black Education, their new approach to the academy influenced other institutions. 21 Where D.C. became a hub for rethinking Black education, New Orleans served as a locus for rethinking Black art. In 1968, the Tulane Drama Review , edited by onetime Free Southern Theater member Richard Schechner, published its landmark \"Black Theatre\" issue. Among the offerings was Larry Neal's foundational essay \"The Black Arts Movement,\" which described the movement's ongoing efforts as the cultural wing of Black Power. If the Black Arts Movement sought to create culture that aided autonomous political efforts, as Neal suggested, the Free Southern Theater put that theory into practice. At the time, its theater troupe formally separated from the group's writers' workshop, BLKARTSOUTH, then under the leadership of Dent and Kalamu ya Salaam. \"For Black theater to have viability in our communities we must have a working tie to those communities,\" Dent wrote of the group's mission, \"something more than the mere performance of plays now and then.\" Consequently, BLKARTSOUTH was composed entirely of New Orleanians, presented their original work, and primarily cast residents as actors. By valorizing the workshop over the production, BLKARTSOUTH embodied a defining trait of the Black Arts Movement: It valued \"process over product.\" 22 Groups across the South likewise experimented with creating new institutions to develop Black culture and political thought. In 1969, the Institute for the Black World began running seminars in Atlanta. \"We were trying to put forward the idea,\" Vincent Harding later recalled, \"that Black scholarship and Black activism were not meant to be separated...and that all of that should be permeated by the arts as well.\" Members of Duke University's Afro-American Association followed through on Harding's goals in Raleigh-Durham, when protests on campus led them to found Malcolm X Liberation University, which aimed to provide an alternative education for Durham's Black residents, including Duke students seeking refuge from a violent campus. And in Nashville in 1970, HBCU faculty and staff founded People's College to teach political and cultural analysis in ways that applied to everyday life. They did so because they saw educating Black people and creating a unique Black culture as essential to building Black nationalism. 23 As the Black Power and Black Arts movements progressed across the South, they increasingly directed their energy toward electoral campaigns as well as the arts and education. In his 1970 \"Coordinator's Statement,\" delivered at the founding convention of the Congress of Afrikan Peoples in Atlanta, Baraka emphasized the importance of voter registration and mobilizing the Black vote. Art played a key part in that effort, with singers like Stevie Wonder, James Brown, and Isaac Hayes supporting Kenneth Gibson's successful 1970 mayoral campaign in Newark. And these electoral victories, as Smethurst notes, also helped the Black Arts Movement by giving \"Black people the administration of political apparatuses with significant control over material resources not before available to Black Power and Black Arts groups.\" 24 Perhaps nowhere was the importance of electoral victories to bolster the Black Arts Movement more on display than in Atlanta. Following his election in 1973, the city's \"culture mayor,\" Maynard Jackson, pledged better funding for the arts. His former speechwriter Michael Lomax led that effort: In 1974 he, the poet Ebon Dooley, and another Jackson campaign staffer and writer, Pearl Cleage, founded the Neighborhood Arts Center, which provided arts education and hosted theater groups in a working-class Black neighborhood. Lomax also helped the writer Toni Cade Bambara secure a position as a writer in residence at Spelman College, another HBCU. In 1975 Jackson appointed Lomax as director of cultural affairs, a position through which he continued financing Black Arts Movement institutions; and in 1978 Bambara, Dooley, and Alice Lovelace founded the Southern Collective of African American Writers, which the Neighborhood Arts Center hosted. In 1979 Lomax helped establish the Fulton County Arts Council, which funded Black Arts Movement organizations throughout the county. By gaining control of the government's spending power through the vote, politicians like Lomax and Jackson, and artists like Bambara and Dooley, developed Atlanta into a hub for radical Black culture. 25 Regional collaborations bolstered these efforts. As the Free Southern Theater and BLKARTSOUTH unraveled in the early 1970s, Dent turned his attention to arts organizations in the South more broadly. He had \"a great dissatisfaction,\" he later recalled, \"with the situation in the early '70s, because I knew that what they were doing in New York was about on the same level with us, but we just didn't have any money.\" Hoping to gain greater recognition and funding, Dent founded the Southern Black Cultural Alliance, which held yearly business meetings at which various organizations could learn from one another how to solve their problems. The alliance also held a yearly conference that brought Black theater troupes and artists across the South to perform. Dent, Salaam, and others then wrote about the conference for a variety of magazines-most notably Hoyt Fuller's Atlanta-based First World , which replaced Black World -as a means of garnering new exposure for their work. By helping artists across the South, the Southern Black Cultural Alliance aided many Black Arts Movement groups in surviving difficult times. 26 Unfortunately, many of these organizations, in Atlanta and in the South more generally, faltered as the federal government scaled back its local funding in the 1980s. In the same year that Ronald Reagan was elected, First World published its final issue. In 1981, when Lomax became chair of the Fulton County Arts Council, the federal government defunded the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act, which had supported many local arts organizations; its 1982 replacement, the Job Placement Training Act, funded far fewer theaters than CETA had. The Reagan administration also provided fewer community block grants, while increasingly conservative Southern state legislatures slashed the funding for Black Arts organizations. Though some managed to persevere, many others had to change their political mission to survive. But as Smethurst reminds his readers, these organizations would have shut down much earlier had they been in other regions; their difficulties in the 1980s after surviving many other conservative turns was less a mark of failure than it was a sign of success. 27 I n Behold the Land , Smethurst demonstrates that decades of organizing and institution building, from the Garveyite years and the Popular Front to the civil rights movement, helped preserve a Black radicalism in the South that eventually became central to the Black Arts Movement in the region.

And these electoral victories, as Smethurst notes, also helped the Black Arts Movement by giving \"Black people the administration of political apparatuses with significant control over material resources not before available to Black Power and Black Arts groups.\" 24 Perhaps nowhere was the importance of electoral victories to bolster the Black Arts Movement more on display than in Atlanta. Following his election in 1973, the city's \"culture mayor,\" Maynard Jackson, pledged better funding for the arts. His former speechwriter Michael Lomax led that effort: In 1974 he, the poet Ebon Dooley, and another Jackson campaign staffer and writer, Pearl Cleage, founded the Neighborhood Arts Center, which provided arts education and hosted theater groups in a working-class Black neighborhood. Lomax also helped the writer Toni Cade Bambara secure a position as a writer in residence at Spelman College, another HBCU. In 1975 Jackson appointed Lomax as director of cultural affairs, a position through which he continued financing Black Arts Movement institutions; and in 1978 Bambara, Dooley, and Alice Lovelace founded the Southern Collective of African American Writers, which the Neighborhood Arts Center hosted. In 1979 Lomax helped establish the Fulton County Arts Council, which funded Black Arts Movement organizations throughout the county. By gaining control of the government's spending power through the vote, politicians like Lomax and Jackson, and artists like Bambara and Dooley, developed Atlanta into a hub for radical Black culture. 25 Regional collaborations bolstered these efforts. As the Free Southern Theater and BLKARTSOUTH unraveled in the early 1970s, Dent turned his attention to arts organizations in the South more broadly. He had \"a great dissatisfaction,\" he later recalled, \"with the situation in the early '70s, because I knew that what they were doing in New York was about on the same level with us, but we just didn't have any money.\" Hoping to gain greater recognition and funding, Dent founded the Southern Black Cultural Alliance, which held yearly business meetings at which various organizations could learn from one another how to solve their problems. The alliance also held a yearly conference that brought Black theater troupes and artists across the South to perform. Dent, Salaam, and others then wrote about the conference for a variety of magazines-most notably Hoyt Fuller's Atlanta-based First World , which replaced Black World -as a means of garnering new exposure for their work. By helping artists across the South, the Southern Black Cultural Alliance aided many Black Arts Movement groups in surviving difficult times. 26 Unfortunately, many of these organizations, in Atlanta and in the South more generally, faltered as the federal government scaled back its local funding in the 1980s. In the same year that Ronald Reagan was elected, First World published its final issue. In 1981, when Lomax became chair of the Fulton County Arts Council, the federal government defunded the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act, which had supported many local arts organizations; its 1982 replacement, the Job Placement Training Act, funded far fewer theaters than CETA had. The Reagan administration also provided fewer community block grants, while increasingly conservative Southern state legislatures slashed the funding for Black Arts organizations. Though some managed to persevere, many others had to change their political mission to survive. But as Smethurst reminds his readers, these organizations would have shut down much earlier had they been in other regions; their difficulties in the 1980s after surviving many other conservative turns was less a mark of failure than it was a sign of success. 27 I n Behold the Land , Smethurst demonstrates that decades of organizing and institution building, from the Garveyite years and the Popular Front to the civil rights movement, helped preserve a Black radicalism in the South that eventually became central to the Black Arts Movement in the region. This radicalism was passed on both directly, as when SNYC members published Black Arts writers in Freedomways , and indirectly, as when the Southern Black Cultural Alliance provided a forum for Black Arts Movement workers to collaborate. But in all cases, the Black Arts and Black Power movements were driven by the goal \"to build a new culture of Black cooperation and self-determination.\" Doing so through the arts had the potential to reorient Black political relations toward a collective building of Black autonomy. \"The great strength of Black Arts, its grassroots character, makes it hard to grasp,\" Smethurst observes. \"Black Arts activities and institutions appeared in almost every community and on every campus where there was an appreciable number of Black people.\" By following some of the lines of Black Arts networks, Smethurst gestures toward the broader collaborative endeavors that enabled the movement to gain a foothold in the South and persevere through periods of conservatism. 28 Through interviews conducted with its surviving participants as well as archival research, Smethurst joins scholars like GerShun Avilez and Carter Mathes in revising the canonical understanding of the Black Arts Movement. Where Margo Crawford has argued, in Black Post-Blackness , that the movement foreshadowed contemporary Black artists in their complication of the meanings of Blackness, Smethurst demonstrates that one way that the Black Arts Movement did so was by building institutions that shaped, if not the contemporary artists directly, then the consumers of the art they produce, the venues in which they produce it, and the communities in which they grew up. This aesthetic legacy also bred a political one: The Black Arts Movement laid the foundation for contemporary community arts organizations, for the use of Black art in electoral campaigns, and for arts education as a Black radical, political practice. Though many Black Power organizations eventually folded, the Black Arts Movement helped spread and institutionalize their ideas. 29 This afterlife is especially clear in the long-lasting reach of Southern Black feminism. While scholars like Mary Helen Washington and activists like Mariame Kaba have worked to recover the often neglected history and legacy of midcentury Black radical feminists, Smethurst's account also reminds us of the role of those and other Popular Front radicals in the formation of the Black Arts Movement, especially in the South. Among the SNYC leaders that Smethurst discusses, for instance, was one Alabaman, Sallye Davis. While she worked as a national officer for the SNYC, she was also raising her daughter, Angela, in the intellectual and physical presence of Communist Party members. This early exposure to Marxism, one imagines, influenced not only Angela Davis's great Black Power autobiography, edited by Toni Morrison and published in 1974, but also her intellectual production and anti-carceral radicalism today. 30 In a similar fashion, the legacy of many Southern Black Arts Movement organizations lives on in the present. As Smethurst argues, they helped \"build new African American cultural institutions in historic African American communities that one finds throughout the South today, and the desire to construct networks between these institutions.\" This institutional and coalitional approach ensured that the unraveling of specific institutions did not mark the end of the Black Arts story. If, as Fannie Lou Hamer observed after viewing the Free Southern Theater's production of Waiting for Godot , Black people know something about waiting, they also know something about the long campaign. Liberation may not come tomorrow, but building institutions might mean that freedom can be achieved in the future. 31\n\nAs the Black Power and Black Arts movements progressed across the South, they increasingly directed their energy toward electoral campaigns as well as the arts and education.

While scholars like Mary Helen Washington and activists like Mariame Kaba have worked to recover the often neglected history and legacy of midcentury Black radical feminists, Smethurst's account also reminds us of the role of those and other Popular Front radicals in the formation of the Black Arts Movement, especially in the South. Among the SNYC leaders that Smethurst discusses, for instance, was one Alabaman, Sallye Davis. While she worked as a national officer for the SNYC, she was also raising her daughter, Angela, in the intellectual and physical presence of Communist Party members. This early exposure to Marxism, one imagines, influenced not only Angela Davis's great Black Power autobiography, edited by Toni Morrison and published in 1974, but also her intellectual production and anti-carceral radicalism today. 30 In a similar fashion, the legacy of many Southern Black Arts Movement organizations lives on in the present. As Smethurst argues, they helped \"build new African American cultural institutions in historic African American communities that one finds throughout the South today, and the desire to construct networks between these institutions.\" This institutional and coalitional approach ensured that the unraveling of specific institutions did not mark the end of the Black Arts story. If, as Fannie Lou Hamer observed after viewing the Free Southern Theater's production of Waiting for Godot , Black people know something about waiting, they also know something about the long campaign. Liberation may not come tomorrow, but building institutions might mean that freedom can be achieved in the future. 31\n\nThis afterlife is especially clear in the long-lasting reach of Southern Black feminism.

Standing in the living room moments before we shrugged on our coats, we belted out lyrics about self-reliance and persistence, finding a kind of armor through song. We wrapped ourselves in the richness and power of Whitney's voice, reaching for the high notes right along with her. I can't remember how long this lasted, but I consider it a defining ritual of my childhood. She's too young now, but I plan to do something similar with my daughter, Isobel, who is 2. Black children and their families need this. We need a kind of anthem, a melodic reminder to ourselves and each other that we are not who the wider world too often tells us we are: criminal, disposable, lazy, undeserving of health or peace or laughter. 1 This article is adapted from We Live for the We: The Political Power of Black Motherhood , by Dani McClain. Reprinted with permission from Bold Type Books, a division of the Hachette Book Group. Black mothers like me know that motherhood is deeply political. Black women are more likely to die during pregnancy or birth than women of any other race. My own mother, who has never married and who worked full-time throughout my childhood, is a model for my own parenting, but culture-war messages from the left and the right tell us she fell short of maternal ideals. My grandmother, great-grandmother, aunts, and elders in the community supported my mother as she raised me. Their investment in me and in other children-some their blood relations, some not-demonstrated an ethic that we can all learn from. Sociologist Patricia Hill Collins has called this \"other-mothering,\" a system of care through which black mothers are accountable to and work on behalf of all black children in a particular community. \"I tell my daughter all the time: We don't live for the 'I.' We live for the 'we,'\" Cat Brooks, an organizer in Oakland, told me. 2 In addition to serving as other-mothers, we've had to fight for our right to be mothers. Prior to Emancipation, the child of an enslaved woman was someone else's property. Slave owners routinely destabilized enslaved people's lives, severing kinship structures rooted in marriage and blood ties; family as a concept became elastic and inclusive. 3 Because of this history, black women have had to inhabit a different understanding of motherhood in order to navigate American life. If we merely accepted the status quo and failed to challenge the forces that have kept black people and women oppressed, then we participated in our own and our children's destruction. In recent years, this has become especially evident, as dozens of black women and men have had to stand before television cameras reminding the world that their recently slain children were in fact human beings, were loved and sources of joy. The mothers of those killed by police or vigilante violence embody every black mother's deepest fears: that we will not be able to adequately protect our children from or prepare them for a world that has to be convinced of their worth. Many parents speak of feeling more fear and anxiety once they take responsibility for keeping another human alive and well. But black women especially know fear-how to live despite it and how to metabolize it for our children so that they're not consumed by it. 4 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis In the fever dream that has been life in the United States since Donald Trump came to power, some of black women's deepest fears have become more comprehensible to the broader society.

At a time when \"Resist!\" has for some become a national battle cry in response to the norms-trampling Trump administration, it's critical to look at the messages communicated within our families and address hypocrisies or inconsistencies head on. Research suggests that white parents in particular need help seeing family as a source of political education, especially when it comes to passing on anti-racist values. A 2007 study in the Journal of Marriage and Family found that out of 17,000 families with kindergartners, parents of color are about three times more likely to discuss race than their white counterparts. Seventy-five percent of the white parents in the study never or almost never talked about race. According to research highlighted in Po Bronson and Ashley Merryman's 2009 book, NurtureShock , white parents communicate messages that skin color doesn't matter and that everyone is equal-messages that children know to be lies based on their own experiences even as early as infancy. When pressed, these parents often admit that they don't know how to talk about race. Black mothers, on the other hand, are scared not of talk of race, but of the impact of racist oppression. We're scared because we have no choice but to release our beloved creations into environments-doctors' offices, hospitals, day-care facilities, playgrounds, schools-where white supremacy is often woven into the fabric of the institution, and is both consciously and unwittingly practiced by the people acting in loco parentis. Black mothers haven't had the luxury of sticking our heads in the sand and hoping that our children learn about race and power as they go. Instead, we must act as a buffer and translator between them and the world, beginning from their earliest days. 6 The right to be a mother: Before Emancipation, enslaved women had no legal right to their children, and slave owners often severed kinship relations rooted in marriage or blood ties. (Library of Congress) I am the daughter of an unmarried black woman. I am now an unmarried black woman raising a girl. I didn't grow up with my father at home. As has been the case since soon after her first birthday, my daughter isn't either. I didn't meet my father until I was in my early 20s. Our meeting was healing, but his absence hadn't mattered in the ways that some people assumed it would. I grew up in a house in the suburbs, the same house where my mom and her sisters and their dad before them had grown up. My maternal grandmother had grown up around the corner. We had a big in-ground pool in the backyard, where I'd swim with my cousins and other neighborhood kids. I grew up playing soccer and riding horses and skiing, and on the few occasions that I was referred to jokingly as a \"Cosby kid,\" I knew what that meant: I was privileged, maybe even a little spoiled. 7 Current Issue View our current issue I always had a kind of unvarnished pride in my upbringing. None of the assumptions people seemed to have about families headed by \"single mothers\" applied to my life. As an only child, I was the focus of my mom's attention and resources. That investment in my success and happiness was supplemented by the love, time, and money of other adults in our family, especially my maternal aunt, Pam, who lived with my mom and me from the time I was 7. Extended family was everything, and while the word \"family\" seemed to mean a mom and dad and siblings to some, to me it's always meant aunts and uncles and cousins and grandparents and the neighborhood elders who watched you grow up. 8 Like me, my daughter is growing up without a dad at home, but the similarities in our experiences end there. My father lived across the country-he'd moved west before I was born to pursue a graduate degree-and we had no contact until I sought him out and initiated a conversation that led to us staying in touch for a few years. My daughter's dad also lives in a different city, but he was by my side during her birth and cared for her daily during the first year of her life, while we were still together romantically, and before he relocated for a job. He visits her often and video-chats with her daily, and they have a relationship that I support and that brings us all joy. Our family is not unique in this. In 2013, a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention corrected the misconception that black men disproportionately shirk their fatherly duties. Instead, black men are generally more likely than men of other races to read to, feed, bathe, and play with their young children on a daily basis, whether they live in the same home as the child or not. Relying on nonmarital birthrates to tell a story about parental involvement has built a false narrative. Just because a father isn't married to his child's mother doesn't mean he's an absent dad. 9 For my daughter's dad and me, it's not easy, but we work at it. For about six months after our breakup, we were in therapy to learn how to parent together despite our separation. I feel proud of us when I read a line from a 2008 study on co-parenting outside of marriage: \"We conclude that parents' ability to work together in rearing their common child across households helps keep nonresident fathers connected to their children and that programs aimed at improving parents' ability to communicate may have benefits for children irrespective of whether the parents' romantic relationship remains intact.\" We created our own program with the coaching of a black woman who talked us through some painful periods and helped us put our goals and commitments on paper. Now here we are-making the road by walking. 10 My father and my daughter's father are college-educated black men from middle-class families. They both grew up with their dads at home. At the time of their children's births, they were gainfully employed or training to advance in a profession. They were not ripped away by death or by the criminal-justice system or by the Pull of the StreetsTM. But not all black single moms have such a benign family backstory. For every 100 black women in communities around the country, there are just 83 black men. \"The remaining men-1.5 million of them-are, in a sense, missing,\" The New York Times reported in April 2015 , and incarceration and early death are to blame. There's no comparable gender gap for white people. For every 100 white women, there are 99 white men. But nearly one in 12 black men between the ages of 25 and 54 are behind bars, a rate that's five times that of nonblack men that age. The imbalance between free, living black boys and free, living black girls starts during their teen years and peaks in their 30s. (To be clear, black women are disproportionately incarcerated as well: One in 200 black women are behind bars, compared with one in 500 nonblack women.) These data help clarify why 30 percent of black families are headed by unmarried women, compared with 13 percent of American households overall. 11 G. Rosaline Preudhomme, a 73-year-old grandmother and organizer, helped pass Washington, DC's Initiative 71, which legalized marijuana. Preudhomme's work seeks to address the systemic reasons for these \"missing\" black men. Fifty thousand people were behind bars for nonviolent drug offenses in 1980. By 1997, that number had jumped to more than 400,000, close to where it remains today. A study by the Economic Policy Institute found that the incarceration of parents takes a serious toll on their children; children of incarcerated parents suffer from more physical and mental health problems than those whose parents aren't behind bars. Still, Preudhomme notes, despite the tremendous pressure that punitive drug policies have put on black communities in the past 40 years, our families persist. That's in part because black Americans have had a structure for organizing family life that predates the drug war and accommodates the absence or intermittent presence of parents. \"It's the resilient spirit of black women that has gotten us through these past 400 years of our family life always being disrupted,\" Preudhomme says. 12 Seeking humanity: Black parents have often had to remind the world that their slain children were in fact human beings. From left: Constance Malcolm, Gwen Carr, Hawa Bah, and Iris Baez all lost sons to police violence. (Sipa via AP) In taking a village-oriented approach to child-rearing, black Americans may be out of step with mainstream white, middle-class American culture, which became more centered on the nuclear family at the middle of the last century with the advent of mass suburbanization. But we're fully in step with how the rest of the world has functioned throughout most of history. A body of research has determined that Western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic countries, with their focus on the nuclear family, bring up children in what anthropologist David Lancy has called \"a departure from all other human culture.\" Most humans across time and space are \"cooperative breeders\" and depend on adult women and older children in the extended family and community to care for the young. 13 W hen I think about my own childhood growing up with my mom and my maternal aunt, the first words that come to mind are \"calm\" and \"even-keeled.\" In the decade before I left home for college, when the three of us lived together, I can remember only one or two times when there were raised voices or heavy silences. This is not to suggest that only men struggle with their tempers. But men are more often socialized to believe that explosive anger and a pouty retreat into themselves are appropriate ways to communicate. I grew up never threatened with \"wait till your father gets home,\" never seeing one adult's needs prioritized over another's. I saw two adults treating each other with love, respect, and humor. I saw that it was possible to be a whole, healthy adult without marriage and, in my aunt's case, without biological children of one's own. Throughout my 30s, I was sympathetic, but somewhat baffled, as I watched some of my women friends struggle to make peace with their unmarried, unpartnered status. Many of them seemed to feel that kids were unlikely, since no partner was in sight, but their predicaments just looked to me like another way to do life. Because of my own upbringing, I felt liberated from the assumption that marriage and mothering must go together. Mainstream culture's glorification of marriage leaves so many people feeling unnecessarily deflated and out of options when that type of union doesn't materialize. 14 Also by Dani McClain What It's Like to Be Black and Pregnant When You Know How Dangerous That Can Be Dani McClain Can Black Lives Matter Win in the Age of Trump? Dani McClain Tarana Burke Talks About How to Support Survivors-When They're Your Kids Dani McClain Last Father's Day, I felt a swell of recognition when I saw black feminist writer Amber J. Phillips tweeting about her own father: \"Because he opted out of being [a] parent, I was raised with the radical idea that I don't actually need a patriarch in my home or life to be happy or feel a false sense of success.\" In her 1987 essay , \"The Meaning of Motherhood in Black Culture and Black Mother/Daughter Relationships,\" Patricia Hill Collins writes that growing up in a household like mine, in which working mothers and extended-family support are common, creates a kind of domino effect. Generation after generation, black women reject ideas that the patriarchal family-and, by extension, patriarchy in the broader society-is normal. Collins suggests that slavery and the economic realities of Jim Crow made it hard for black families to create the separate, gender-based spheres of influence (father as economic provider and head of household, mother as nurturer and subordinate) that white America lauded as the ideal organization of family life. Instead, black girls grow up with a sense of empowerment and possibility that girls of other races don't necessarily see modeled at home or in their communities. \"Since Black mothers have a distinctive relationship to white patriarchy, they may be less likely to socialize their daughters into their proscribed roles as subordinates,\" Collins writes. 15 Black families have developed a tradition of passing onto our children a culture that repels the forces of white supremacy and creates ample opportunities to question patriarchy. But unmarried black mothers and their daughters aren't lauded for holding the keys to resisting patriarchal oppression. Our reliance on extended family networks and collective approaches to childcare, our rejection of the nuclear family as the only way to organize our lives, has been consistently derided throughout history. The dominant narrative is that we're poor, draining public coffers, and so a blight on society. The safety zones that black parents have created, with leadership from black mothers, the places where we learn that we are not who the world tells us we are, have been criticized by everyone from Daniel Patrick Moynihan in the 1960s to the American Enterprise Institute's W. Bradford Wilcox today. 16 Devoted dads: Black fathers are more likely than men of other races to read to, feed, bathe, and play with their young children on a daily basis, whether they live in the same home or not. (AP / David Goldman) Those who promote marriage as social policy want us to believe that getting married will automatically lift poor people out of poverty. But poor plus poor does not somehow equal middle class. It means two poor adults raising poor kids and trying to figure out how to survive. Lost in the conversation is the impact that low-wage work has on black families. The question shouldn't be whether we can put together two measly paychecks, but whether we as individuals can get paid a fair wage for the work that we do. In 2016, nearly 40 percent of black, female-headed households with children lived in poverty-meaning over 60 percent did not. Why don't we talk about how that 60 percent is often doing just fine, or why that 40 percent is actually impoverished? 17 Governments aren't equipped to understand all the pressures that low-income couples face, and they shouldn't presume to meddle in romantic relationships. What governments are equipped to do is address poverty head on, by acknowledging and supporting people's economic and social rights. Social policies such as paid parental leave, universal child care, and universal health care would go a long way to alleviate the financial pressures that unmarried moms face. This kind of government intervention is why a single mother and her child in Denmark are no more likely to be poor than a married mother and her child. 18 But the complex story of family formation and black mothering isn't only about beating back stigma and correcting falsehoods; the psychic and emotional impact of leading households on our own is often ignored. I've been guilty of this myself. In writing about black women and marriage in the past, I've failed to acknowledge that some of us actually aspire to the narratives of being chosen, of living happily ever after. Yes, it's important that we can and do successfully raise children without steady, committed romantic partners. But can we also note how depressing it is that we so often have to? There's a reason some black women were excited when finally, after 12 seasons of the franchise, there was a black Bachelorette . Some of us want love, marriage, and a baby carriage in exactly that order, and preferably with black men. It's important to acknowledge how it feels when those desires are often out of reach for us in a way they're just not for other women. 19 Poverty's true causes: Lost in the conversation about single parenthood and poverty is the impact of low-wage work on black families. No wonder so many Fight for $15 leaders are black women. Add to the existential angst the day-to-day responsibility of being in charge. Even with family help and enough money to pay for childcare, it's exhausting to be the sole adult responsible for cooking, bathing, reading, playing, and cleaning on those days or in those stretches of hours when you're going it alone. I never take it for granted that I was 100 percent certain I wanted to be a mother when I had my daughter. I can't imagine giving mothering the energy it demands and deserves if I had come into this reluctantly, especially now that it's often just the two of us. I enjoy the work of mothering and don't often feel like I'm going through the motions or putting on a brave face, but there have been times when my spirit has flagged under the weight. I'm reminded of those times, the moments I've blinked back tears, when I read asha bandele's memoir, Something Like Beautiful , about raising her daughter while her husband was incarcerated and then deported. She writes: \"I told myself if I cried I was setting a bad example for my daughter. Others told me the very same thing. Told me never to be a victim, Black women are not victims and we are not weak.... In the post-welfare-reform days of the alpha mom, I was clear that being a victim, showing any weakness, was punishable by complete isolation and total loss of respect. I was a mother, a single mother, a single Black mother. I was part of a tradition of women who do not bend and who do not break. This is what I said, this is how I now defined myself. As someone with no room for error.\" 20 I see little room for error in my own life. I have to guard against letting parenting become one more place I practice perfectionism. There are so many reasons to try to do it as close to perfectly as possible, since the mainstream conversation tells me that as both an unmarried mom and the child of an unmarried mom, I'm incapable of being or raising a successful, well-adjusted person. Even though I have known since childhood how mean-spirited and hollow that conversation is, I'm still affected by the stigma. As I get older, I can also see the danger in being too defensive, in disproving others' assumptions before I honestly explore my own nuanced truths. In 2007, artist Meshell Ndegeocello released an album called The World Has Made Me the Man of My Dreams . That album's title reminds me that learning to navigate an often-inhospitable world on one's own and with the help of relatives and friends can make us into our own rock-solid protectors. Partnership with a man can begin to feel unnecessary: nice when it comes along, but not a must for survival or happiness. This strength can be a source of pride, but it can also be reason to grieve when one starts to think about all the structural and historical reasons that black women have had to be so independent, and black men have often been unavailable or unwilling to offer meaningful help. 21 It's a February day, and Is and I are at the playground. I push her on the swing and notice that she can't take her eyes off the next swing over, where a dad is pushing his daughter. I think to myself: I know that feeling. That \"Why don't I have that?\" feeling. That \"Where's my dad?\" feeling. That \"I want bigger, messier, gruffer, rougher, and sillier than Mom\" feeling. But the truth is that I'm projecting. My child is a watcher; she's super-nosy and could be thinking anything. She actually gets playground time with her dad, though not daily. But my mind goes there because I am still, at 39, processing my own feelings around abandonment and loss. I don't want that for my daughter. I don't want her to know that sense of longing. If she does, I want her to know that she can express it, put it out in the open. In my experience, the silence around an absence can do more harm than the absence itself. For Is and for me, the challenge is to find-to make-space where we can be vulnerable and acknowledge hurt without giving into the narrative that we are of and in a \"broken family.\" As we are, our family is perfectly whole. 22\n\nThis article is adapted from We Live for the We: The Political Power of Black Motherhood , by Dani McClain.

Research suggests that white parents in particular need help seeing family as a source of political education, especially when it comes to passing on anti-racist values. A 2007 study in the Journal of Marriage and Family found that out of 17,000 families with kindergartners, parents of color are about three times more likely to discuss race than their white counterparts. Seventy-five percent of the white parents in the study never or almost never talked about race. According to research highlighted in Po Bronson and Ashley Merryman's 2009 book, NurtureShock , white parents communicate messages that skin color doesn't matter and that everyone is equal-messages that children know to be lies based on their own experiences even as early as infancy. When pressed, these parents often admit that they don't know how to talk about race. Black mothers, on the other hand, are scared not of talk of race, but of the impact of racist oppression. We're scared because we have no choice but to release our beloved creations into environments-doctors' offices, hospitals, day-care facilities, playgrounds, schools-where white supremacy is often woven into the fabric of the institution, and is both consciously and unwittingly practiced by the people acting in loco parentis. Black mothers haven't had the luxury of sticking our heads in the sand and hoping that our children learn about race and power as they go. Instead, we must act as a buffer and translator between them and the world, beginning from their earliest days. 6 The right to be a mother: Before Emancipation, enslaved women had no legal right to their children, and slave owners often severed kinship relations rooted in marriage or blood ties. (Library of Congress) I am the daughter of an unmarried black woman. I am now an unmarried black woman raising a girl. I didn't grow up with my father at home. As has been the case since soon after her first birthday, my daughter isn't either. I didn't meet my father until I was in my early 20s. Our meeting was healing, but his absence hadn't mattered in the ways that some people assumed it would. I grew up in a house in the suburbs, the same house where my mom and her sisters and their dad before them had grown up. My maternal grandmother had grown up around the corner. We had a big in-ground pool in the backyard, where I'd swim with my cousins and other neighborhood kids. I grew up playing soccer and riding horses and skiing, and on the few occasions that I was referred to jokingly as a \"Cosby kid,\" I knew what that meant: I was privileged, maybe even a little spoiled. 7 Current Issue View our current issue I always had a kind of unvarnished pride in my upbringing. None of the assumptions people seemed to have about families headed by \"single mothers\" applied to my life. As an only child, I was the focus of my mom's attention and resources. That investment in my success and happiness was supplemented by the love, time, and money of other adults in our family, especially my maternal aunt, Pam, who lived with my mom and me from the time I was 7. Extended family was everything, and while the word \"family\" seemed to mean a mom and dad and siblings to some, to me it's always meant aunts and uncles and cousins and grandparents and the neighborhood elders who watched you grow up. 8 Like me, my daughter is growing up without a dad at home, but the similarities in our experiences end there. My father lived across the country-he'd moved west before I was born to pursue a graduate degree-and we had no contact until I sought him out and initiated a conversation that led to us staying in touch for a few years. My daughter's dad also lives in a different city, but he was by my side during her birth and cared for her daily during the first year of her life, while we were still together romantically, and before he relocated for a job. He visits her often and video-chats with her daily, and they have a relationship that I support and that brings us all joy. Our family is not unique in this. In 2013, a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention corrected the misconception that black men disproportionately shirk their fatherly duties. Instead, black men are generally more likely than men of other races to read to, feed, bathe, and play with their young children on a daily basis, whether they live in the same home as the child or not. Relying on nonmarital birthrates to tell a story about parental involvement has built a false narrative. Just because a father isn't married to his child's mother doesn't mean he's an absent dad. 9 For my daughter's dad and me, it's not easy, but we work at it. For about six months after our breakup, we were in therapy to learn how to parent together despite our separation. I feel proud of us when I read a line from a 2008 study on co-parenting outside of marriage: \"We conclude that parents' ability to work together in rearing their common child across households helps keep nonresident fathers connected to their children and that programs aimed at improving parents' ability to communicate may have benefits for children irrespective of whether the parents' romantic relationship remains intact.\" We created our own program with the coaching of a black woman who talked us through some painful periods and helped us put our goals and commitments on paper. Now here we are-making the road by walking. 10 My father and my daughter's father are college-educated black men from middle-class families. They both grew up with their dads at home. At the time of their children's births, they were gainfully employed or training to advance in a profession. They were not ripped away by death or by the criminal-justice system or by the Pull of the StreetsTM. But not all black single moms have such a benign family backstory. For every 100 black women in communities around the country, there are just 83 black men. \"The remaining men-1.5 million of them-are, in a sense, missing,\" The New York Times reported in April 2015 , and incarceration and early death are to blame. There's no comparable gender gap for white people. For every 100 white women, there are 99 white men. But nearly one in 12 black men between the ages of 25 and 54 are behind bars, a rate that's five times that of nonblack men that age. The imbalance between free, living black boys and free, living black girls starts during their teen years and peaks in their 30s. (To be clear, black women are disproportionately incarcerated as well: One in 200 black women are behind bars, compared with one in 500 nonblack women.) These data help clarify why 30 percent of black families are headed by unmarried women, compared with 13 percent of American households overall. 11 G. Rosaline Preudhomme, a 73-year-old grandmother and organizer, helped pass Washington, DC's Initiative 71, which legalized marijuana. Preudhomme's work seeks to address the systemic reasons for these \"missing\" black men. Fifty thousand people were behind bars for nonviolent drug offenses in 1980. By 1997, that number had jumped to more than 400,000, close to where it remains today. A study by the Economic Policy Institute found that the incarceration of parents takes a serious toll on their children; children of incarcerated parents suffer from more physical and mental health problems than those whose parents aren't behind bars. Still, Preudhomme notes, despite the tremendous pressure that punitive drug policies have put on black communities in the past 40 years, our families persist. That's in part because black Americans have had a structure for organizing family life that predates the drug war and accommodates the absence or intermittent presence of parents. \"It's the resilient spirit of black women that has gotten us through these past 400 years of our family life always being disrupted,\" Preudhomme says. 12 Seeking humanity: Black parents have often had to remind the world that their slain children were in fact human beings. From left: Constance Malcolm, Gwen Carr, Hawa Bah, and Iris Baez all lost sons to police violence. (Sipa via AP) In taking a village-oriented approach to child-rearing, black Americans may be out of step with mainstream white, middle-class American culture, which became more centered on the nuclear family at the middle of the last century with the advent of mass suburbanization. But we're fully in step with how the rest of the world has functioned throughout most of history. A body of research has determined that Western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic countries, with their focus on the nuclear family, bring up children in what anthropologist David Lancy has called \"a departure from all other human culture.\" Most humans across time and space are \"cooperative breeders\" and depend on adult women and older children in the extended family and community to care for the young. 13 W hen I think about my own childhood growing up with my mom and my maternal aunt, the first words that come to mind are \"calm\" and \"even-keeled.\" In the decade before I left home for college, when the three of us lived together, I can remember only one or two times when there were raised voices or heavy silences. This is not to suggest that only men struggle with their tempers. But men are more often socialized to believe that explosive anger and a pouty retreat into themselves are appropriate ways to communicate. I grew up never threatened with \"wait till your father gets home,\" never seeing one adult's needs prioritized over another's. I saw two adults treating each other with love, respect, and humor. I saw that it was possible to be a whole, healthy adult without marriage and, in my aunt's case, without biological children of one's own. Throughout my 30s, I was sympathetic, but somewhat baffled, as I watched some of my women friends struggle to make peace with their unmarried, unpartnered status. Many of them seemed to feel that kids were unlikely, since no partner was in sight, but their predicaments just looked to me like another way to do life. Because of my own upbringing, I felt liberated from the assumption that marriage and mothering must go together. Mainstream culture's glorification of marriage leaves so many people feeling unnecessarily deflated and out of options when that type of union doesn't materialize. 14 Also by Dani McClain What It's Like to Be Black and Pregnant When You Know How Dangerous That Can Be Dani McClain Can Black Lives Matter Win in the Age of Trump? Dani McClain Tarana Burke Talks About How to Support Survivors-When They're Your Kids Dani McClain Last Father's Day, I felt a swell of recognition when I saw black feminist writer Amber J. Phillips tweeting about her own father: \"Because he opted out of being [a] parent, I was raised with the radical idea that I don't actually need a patriarch in my home or life to be happy or feel a false sense of success.\" In her 1987 essay , \"The Meaning of Motherhood in Black Culture and Black Mother/Daughter Relationships,\" Patricia Hill Collins writes that growing up in a household like mine, in which working mothers and extended-family support are common, creates a kind of domino effect. Generation after generation, black women reject ideas that the patriarchal family-and, by extension, patriarchy in the broader society-is normal. Collins suggests that slavery and the economic realities of Jim Crow made it hard for black families to create the separate, gender-based spheres of influence (father as economic provider and head of household, mother as nurturer and subordinate) that white America lauded as the ideal organization of family life. Instead, black girls grow up with a sense of empowerment and possibility that girls of other races don't necessarily see modeled at home or in their communities. \"Since Black mothers have a distinctive relationship to white patriarchy, they may be less likely to socialize their daughters into their proscribed roles as subordinates,\" Collins writes. 15 Black families have developed a tradition of passing onto our children a culture that repels the forces of white supremacy and creates ample opportunities to question patriarchy. But unmarried black mothers and their daughters aren't lauded for holding the keys to resisting patriarchal oppression. Our reliance on extended family networks and collective approaches to childcare, our rejection of the nuclear family as the only way to organize our lives, has been consistently derided throughout history. The dominant narrative is that we're poor, draining public coffers, and so a blight on society. The safety zones that black parents have created, with leadership from black mothers, the places where we learn that we are not who the world tells us we are, have been criticized by everyone from Daniel Patrick Moynihan in the 1960s to the American Enterprise Institute's W. Bradford Wilcox today. 16 Devoted dads: Black fathers are more likely than men of other races to read to, feed, bathe, and play with their young children on a daily basis, whether they live in the same home or not. (AP / David Goldman) Those who promote marriage as social policy want us to believe that getting married will automatically lift poor people out of poverty. But poor plus poor does not somehow equal middle class. It means two poor adults raising poor kids and trying to figure out how to survive. Lost in the conversation is the impact that low-wage work has on black families. The question shouldn't be whether we can put together two measly paychecks, but whether we as individuals can get paid a fair wage for the work that we do. In 2016, nearly 40 percent of black, female-headed households with children lived in poverty-meaning over 60 percent did not. Why don't we talk about how that 60 percent is often doing just fine, or why that 40 percent is actually impoverished? 17 Governments aren't equipped to understand all the pressures that low-income couples face, and they shouldn't presume to meddle in romantic relationships. What governments are equipped to do is address poverty head on, by acknowledging and supporting people's economic and social rights. Social policies such as paid parental leave, universal child care, and universal health care would go a long way to alleviate the financial pressures that unmarried moms face. This kind of government intervention is why a single mother and her child in Denmark are no more likely to be poor than a married mother and her child. 18 But the complex story of family formation and black mothering isn't only about beating back stigma and correcting falsehoods; the psychic and emotional impact of leading households on our own is often ignored. I've been guilty of this myself. In writing about black women and marriage in the past, I've failed to acknowledge that some of us actually aspire to the narratives of being chosen, of living happily ever after. Yes, it's important that we can and do successfully raise children without steady, committed romantic partners. But can we also note how depressing it is that we so often have to? There's a reason some black women were excited when finally, after 12 seasons of the franchise, there was a black Bachelorette . Some of us want love, marriage, and a baby carriage in exactly that order, and preferably with black men. It's important to acknowledge how it feels when those desires are often out of reach for us in a way they're just not for other women. 19 Poverty's true causes: Lost in the conversation about single parenthood and poverty is the impact of low-wage work on black families. No wonder so many Fight for $15 leaders are black women. Add to the existential angst the day-to-day responsibility of being in charge. Even with family help and enough money to pay for childcare, it's exhausting to be the sole adult responsible for cooking, bathing, reading, playing, and cleaning on those days or in those stretches of hours when you're going it alone. I never take it for granted that I was 100 percent certain I wanted to be a mother when I had my daughter. I can't imagine giving mothering the energy it demands and deserves if I had come into this reluctantly, especially now that it's often just the two of us. I enjoy the work of mothering and don't often feel like I'm going through the motions or putting on a brave face, but there have been times when my spirit has flagged under the weight. I'm reminded of those times, the moments I've blinked back tears, when I read asha bandele's memoir, Something Like Beautiful , about raising her daughter while her husband was incarcerated and then deported. She writes: \"I told myself if I cried I was setting a bad example for my daughter. Others told me the very same thing. Told me never to be a victim, Black women are not victims and we are not weak.... In the post-welfare-reform days of the alpha mom, I was clear that being a victim, showing any weakness, was punishable by complete isolation and total loss of respect. I was a mother, a single mother, a single Black mother. I was part of a tradition of women who do not bend and who do not break. This is what I said, this is how I now defined myself. As someone with no room for error.\" 20 I see little room for error in my own life. I have to guard against letting parenting become one more place I practice perfectionism. There are so many reasons to try to do it as close to perfectly as possible, since the mainstream conversation tells me that as both an unmarried mom and the child of an unmarried mom, I'm incapable of being or raising a successful, well-adjusted person. Even though I have known since childhood how mean-spirited and hollow that conversation is, I'm still affected by the stigma. As I get older, I can also see the danger in being too defensive, in disproving others' assumptions before I honestly explore my own nuanced truths. In 2007, artist Meshell Ndegeocello released an album called The World Has Made Me the Man of My Dreams . That album's title reminds me that learning to navigate an often-inhospitable world on one's own and with the help of relatives and friends can make us into our own rock-solid protectors. Partnership with a man can begin to feel unnecessary: nice when it comes along, but not a must for survival or happiness. This strength can be a source of pride, but it can also be reason to grieve when one starts to think about all the structural and historical reasons that black women have had to be so independent, and black men have often been unavailable or unwilling to offer meaningful help. 21 It's a February day, and Is and I are at the playground. I push her on the swing and notice that she can't take her eyes off the next swing over, where a dad is pushing his daughter. I think to myself: I know that feeling. That \"Why don't I have that?\" feeling. That \"Where's my dad?\" feeling. That \"I want bigger, messier, gruffer, rougher, and sillier than Mom\" feeling. But the truth is that I'm projecting. My child is a watcher; she's super-nosy and could be thinking anything. She actually gets playground time with her dad, though not daily. But my mind goes there because I am still, at 39, processing my own feelings around abandonment and loss. I don't want that for my daughter. I don't want her to know that sense of longing. If she does, I want her to know that she can express it, put it out in the open. In my experience, the silence around an absence can do more harm than the absence itself. For Is and for me, the challenge is to find-to make-space where we can be vulnerable and acknowledge hurt without giving into the narrative that we are of and in a \"broken family.\" As we are, our family is perfectly whole. 22\n\nIn addition to serving as other-mothers, we've had to fight for our right to be mothers. Prior to Emancipation, the child of an enslaved woman was someone else's property. Slave owners routinely destabilized enslaved people's lives, severing kinship structures rooted in marriage and blood ties; family as a concept became elastic and inclusive. 3 Because of this history, black women have had to inhabit a different understanding of motherhood in order to navigate American life. If we merely accepted the status quo and failed to challenge the forces that have kept black people and women oppressed, then we participated in our own and our children's destruction. In recent years, this has become especially evident, as dozens of black women and men have had to stand before television cameras reminding the world that their recently slain children were in fact human beings, were loved and sources of joy. The mothers of those killed by police or vigilante violence embody every black mother's deepest fears: that we will not be able to adequately protect our children from or prepare them for a world that has to be convinced of their worth. Many parents speak of feeling more fear and anxiety once they take responsibility for keeping another human alive and well. But black women especially know fear-how to live despite it and how to metabolize it for our children so that they're not consumed by it. 4 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis In the fever dream that has been life in the United States since Donald Trump came to power, some of black women's deepest fears have become more comprehensible to the broader society. No one has ever been able to guarantee safe passage into adulthood for their children, but nonblack parents with money, citizenship, and class status had a leg up on the rest of us. Now, even for many of them, the threats and uncertainty seem to multiply by the day. The Trump era has given those who may have previously felt invulnerable to the shifting tides of human fortune a wake-up call. 5 Related Article What It's Like to Be Black and Pregnant When You Know How Dangerous That Can Be Dani McClain Family is often the first social institution to shape how we understand our identities and our politics.

The safety zones that black parents have created, with leadership from black mothers, the places where we learn that we are not who the world tells us we are, have been criticized by everyone from Daniel Patrick Moynihan in the 1960s to the American Enterprise Institute's W. Bradford Wilcox today. 16 Devoted dads: Black fathers are more likely than men of other races to read to, feed, bathe, and play with their young children on a daily basis, whether they live in the same home or not. (AP / David Goldman) Those who promote marriage as social policy want us to believe that getting married will automatically lift poor people out of poverty. But poor plus poor does not somehow equal middle class. It means two poor adults raising poor kids and trying to figure out how to survive. Lost in the conversation is the impact that low-wage work has on black families. The question shouldn't be whether we can put together two measly paychecks, but whether we as individuals can get paid a fair wage for the work that we do. In 2016, nearly 40 percent of black, female-headed households with children lived in poverty-meaning over 60 percent did not. Why don't we talk about how that 60 percent is often doing just fine, or why that 40 percent is actually impoverished? 17 Governments aren't equipped to understand all the pressures that low-income couples face, and they shouldn't presume to meddle in romantic relationships. What governments are equipped to do is address poverty head on, by acknowledging and supporting people's economic and social rights. Social policies such as paid parental leave, universal child care, and universal health care would go a long way to alleviate the financial pressures that unmarried moms face. This kind of government intervention is why a single mother and her child in Denmark are no more likely to be poor than a married mother and her child. 18 But the complex story of family formation and black mothering isn't only about beating back stigma and correcting falsehoods; the psychic and emotional impact of leading households on our own is often ignored. I've been guilty of this myself. In writing about black women and marriage in the past, I've failed to acknowledge that some of us actually aspire to the narratives of being chosen, of living happily ever after. Yes, it's important that we can and do successfully raise children without steady, committed romantic partners. But can we also note how depressing it is that we so often have to? There's a reason some black women were excited when finally, after 12 seasons of the franchise, there was a black Bachelorette . Some of us want love, marriage, and a baby carriage in exactly that order, and preferably with black men. It's important to acknowledge how it feels when those desires are often out of reach for us in a way they're just not for other women. 19 Poverty's true causes: Lost in the conversation about single parenthood and poverty is the impact of low-wage work on black families. No wonder so many Fight for $15 leaders are black women. Add to the existential angst the day-to-day responsibility of being in charge. Even with family help and enough money to pay for childcare, it's exhausting to be the sole adult responsible for cooking, bathing, reading, playing, and cleaning on those days or in those stretches of hours when you're going it alone. I never take it for granted that I was 100 percent certain I wanted to be a mother when I had my daughter. I can't imagine giving mothering the energy it demands and deserves if I had come into this reluctantly, especially now that it's often just the two of us. I enjoy the work of mothering and don't often feel like I'm going through the motions or putting on a brave face, but there have been times when my spirit has flagged under the weight. I'm reminded of those times, the moments I've blinked back tears, when I read asha bandele's memoir, Something Like Beautiful , about raising her daughter while her husband was incarcerated and then deported. She writes: \"I told myself if I cried I was setting a bad example for my daughter. Others told me the very same thing. Told me never to be a victim, Black women are not victims and we are not weak.... In the post-welfare-reform days of the alpha mom, I was clear that being a victim, showing any weakness, was punishable by complete isolation and total loss of respect. I was a mother, a single mother, a single Black mother. I was part of a tradition of women who do not bend and who do not break. This is what I said, this is how I now defined myself. As someone with no room for error.\" 20 I see little room for error in my own life. I have to guard against letting parenting become one more place I practice perfectionism. There are so many reasons to try to do it as close to perfectly as possible, since the mainstream conversation tells me that as both an unmarried mom and the child of an unmarried mom, I'm incapable of being or raising a successful, well-adjusted person. Even though I have known since childhood how mean-spirited and hollow that conversation is, I'm still affected by the stigma. As I get older, I can also see the danger in being too defensive, in disproving others' assumptions before I honestly explore my own nuanced truths. In 2007, artist Meshell Ndegeocello released an album called The World Has Made Me the Man of My Dreams . That album's title reminds me that learning to navigate an often-inhospitable world on one's own and with the help of relatives and friends can make us into our own rock-solid protectors. Partnership with a man can begin to feel unnecessary: nice when it comes along, but not a must for survival or happiness. This strength can be a source of pride, but it can also be reason to grieve when one starts to think about all the structural and historical reasons that black women have had to be so independent, and black men have often been unavailable or unwilling to offer meaningful help. 21 It's a February day, and Is and I are at the playground. I push her on the swing and notice that she can't take her eyes off the next swing over, where a dad is pushing his daughter. I think to myself: I know that feeling. That \"Why don't I have that?\" feeling. That \"Where's my dad?\" feeling. That \"I want bigger, messier, gruffer, rougher, and sillier than Mom\" feeling. But the truth is that I'm projecting. My child is a watcher; she's super-nosy and could be thinking anything. She actually gets playground time with her dad, though not daily. But my mind goes there because I am still, at 39, processing my own feelings around abandonment and loss. I don't want that for my daughter. I don't want her to know that sense of longing. If she does, I want her to know that she can express it, put it out in the open. In my experience, the silence around an absence can do more harm than the absence itself. For Is and for me, the challenge is to find-to make-space where we can be vulnerable and acknowledge hurt without giving into the narrative that we are of and in a \"broken family.\" As we are, our family is perfectly whole. 22\n\nBecause of this history, black women have had to inhabit a different understanding of motherhood in order to navigate American life. If we merely accepted the status quo and failed to challenge the forces that have kept black people and women oppressed, then we participated in our own and our children's destruction. In recent years, this has become especially evident, as dozens of black women and men have had to stand before television cameras reminding the world that their recently slain children were in fact human beings, were loved and sources of joy. The mothers of those killed by police or vigilante violence embody every black mother's deepest fears: that we will not be able to adequately protect our children from or prepare them for a world that has to be convinced of their worth. Many parents speak of feeling more fear and anxiety once they take responsibility for keeping another human alive and well. But black women especially know fear-how to live despite it and how to metabolize it for our children so that they're not consumed by it. 4 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis In the fever dream that has been life in the United States since Donald Trump came to power, some of black women's deepest fears have become more comprehensible to the broader society. No one has ever been able to guarantee safe passage into adulthood for their children, but nonblack parents with money, citizenship, and class status had a leg up on the rest of us. Now, even for many of them, the threats and uncertainty seem to multiply by the day. The Trump era has given those who may have previously felt invulnerable to the shifting tides of human fortune a wake-up call. 5 Related Article What It's Like to Be Black and Pregnant When You Know How Dangerous That Can Be Dani McClain Family is often the first social institution to shape how we understand our identities and our politics. At a time when \"Resist!\" has for some become a national battle cry in response to the norms-trampling Trump administration, it's critical to look at the messages communicated within our families and address hypocrisies or inconsistencies head on. Research suggests that white parents in particular need help seeing family as a source of political education, especially when it comes to passing on anti-racist values. A 2007 study in the Journal of Marriage and Family found that out of 17,000 families with kindergartners, parents of color are about three times more likely to discuss race than their white counterparts. Seventy-five percent of the white parents in the study never or almost never talked about race. According to research highlighted in Po Bronson and Ashley Merryman's 2009 book, NurtureShock , white parents communicate messages that skin color doesn't matter and that everyone is equal-messages that children know to be lies based on their own experiences even as early as infancy. When pressed, these parents often admit that they don't know how to talk about race. Black mothers, on the other hand, are scared not of talk of race, but of the impact of racist oppression. We're scared because we have no choice but to release our beloved creations into environments-doctors' offices, hospitals, day-care facilities, playgrounds, schools-where white supremacy is often woven into the fabric of the institution, and is both consciously and unwittingly practiced by the people acting in loco parentis. Black mothers haven't had the luxury of sticking our heads in the sand and hoping that our children learn about race and power as they go. Instead, we must act as a buffer and translator between them and the world, beginning from their earliest days. 6 The right to be a mother: Before Emancipation, enslaved women had no legal right to their children, and slave owners often severed kinship relations rooted in marriage or blood ties. (Library of Congress) I am the daughter of an unmarried black woman. I am now an unmarried black woman raising a girl. I didn't grow up with my father at home. As has been the case since soon after her first birthday, my daughter isn't either. I didn't meet my father until I was in my early 20s. Our meeting was healing, but his absence hadn't mattered in the ways that some people assumed it would. I grew up in a house in the suburbs, the same house where my mom and her sisters and their dad before them had grown up. My maternal grandmother had grown up around the corner. We had a big in-ground pool in the backyard, where I'd swim with my cousins and other neighborhood kids. I grew up playing soccer and riding horses and skiing, and on the few occasions that I was referred to jokingly as a \"Cosby kid,\" I knew what that meant: I was privileged, maybe even a little spoiled. 7 Current Issue View our current issue I always had a kind of unvarnished pride in my upbringing. None of the assumptions people seemed to have about families headed by \"single mothers\" applied to my life. As an only child, I was the focus of my mom's attention and resources. That investment in my success and happiness was supplemented by the love, time, and money of other adults in our family, especially my maternal aunt, Pam, who lived with my mom and me from the time I was 7. Extended family was everything, and while the word \"family\" seemed to mean a mom and dad and siblings to some, to me it's always meant aunts and uncles and cousins and grandparents and the neighborhood elders who watched you grow up. 8 Like me, my daughter is growing up without a dad at home, but the similarities in our experiences end there. My father lived across the country-he'd moved west before I was born to pursue a graduate degree-and we had no contact until I sought him out and initiated a conversation that led to us staying in touch for a few years. My daughter's dad also lives in a different city, but he was by my side during her birth and cared for her daily during the first year of her life, while we were still together romantically, and before he relocated for a job. He visits her often and video-chats with her daily, and they have a relationship that I support and that brings us all joy. Our family is not unique in this. In 2013, a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention corrected the misconception that black men disproportionately shirk their fatherly duties. Instead, black men are generally more likely than men of other races to read to, feed, bathe, and play with their young children on a daily basis, whether they live in the same home as the child or not. Relying on nonmarital birthrates to tell a story about parental involvement has built a false narrative. Just because a father isn't married to his child's mother doesn't mean he's an absent dad. 9 For my daughter's dad and me, it's not easy, but we work at it. For about six months after our breakup, we were in therapy to learn how to parent together despite our separation. I feel proud of us when I read a line from a 2008 study on co-parenting outside of marriage: \"We conclude that parents' ability to work together in rearing their common child across households helps keep nonresident fathers connected to their children and that programs aimed at improving parents' ability to communicate may have benefits for children irrespective of whether the parents' romantic relationship remains intact.\" We created our own program with the coaching of a black woman who talked us through some painful periods and helped us put our goals and commitments on paper. Now here we are-making the road by walking. 10 My father and my daughter's father are college-educated black men from middle-class families. They both grew up with their dads at home. At the time of their children's births, they were gainfully employed or training to advance in a profession. They were not ripped away by death or by the criminal-justice system or by the Pull of the StreetsTM. But not all black single moms have such a benign family backstory. For every 100 black women in communities around the country, there are just 83 black men. \"The remaining men-1.5 million of them-are, in a sense, missing,\" The New York Times reported in April 2015 , and incarceration and early death are to blame. There's no comparable gender gap for white people. For every 100 white women, there are 99 white men. But nearly one in 12 black men between the ages of 25 and 54 are behind bars, a rate that's five times that of nonblack men that age. The imbalance between free, living black boys and free, living black girls starts during their teen years and peaks in their 30s. (To be clear, black women are disproportionately incarcerated as well: One in 200 black women are behind bars, compared with one in 500 nonblack women.) These data help clarify why 30 percent of black families are headed by unmarried women, compared with 13 percent of American households overall. 11 G. Rosaline Preudhomme, a 73-year-old grandmother and organizer, helped pass Washington, DC's Initiative 71, which legalized marijuana. Preudhomme's work seeks to address the systemic reasons for these \"missing\" black men. Fifty thousand people were behind bars for nonviolent drug offenses in 1980. By 1997, that number had jumped to more than 400,000, close to where it remains today. A study by the Economic Policy Institute found that the incarceration of parents takes a serious toll on their children; children of incarcerated parents suffer from more physical and mental health problems than those whose parents aren't behind bars. Still, Preudhomme notes, despite the tremendous pressure that punitive drug policies have put on black communities in the past 40 years, our families persist. That's in part because black Americans have had a structure for organizing family life that predates the drug war and accommodates the absence or intermittent presence of parents. \"It's the resilient spirit of black women that has gotten us through these past 400 years of our family life always being disrupted,\" Preudhomme says. 12 Seeking humanity: Black parents have often had to remind the world that their slain children were in fact human beings. From left: Constance Malcolm, Gwen Carr, Hawa Bah, and Iris Baez all lost sons to police violence. (Sipa via AP) In taking a village-oriented approach to child-rearing, black Americans may be out of step with mainstream white, middle-class American culture, which became more centered on the nuclear family at the middle of the last century with the advent of mass suburbanization. But we're fully in step with how the rest of the world has functioned throughout most of history. A body of research has determined that Western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic countries, with their focus on the nuclear family, bring up children in what anthropologist David Lancy has called \"a departure from all other human culture.\" Most humans across time and space are \"cooperative breeders\" and depend on adult women and older children in the extended family and community to care for the young. 13 W hen I think about my own childhood growing up with my mom and my maternal aunt, the first words that come to mind are \"calm\" and \"even-keeled.\" In the decade before I left home for college, when the three of us lived together, I can remember only one or two times when there were raised voices or heavy silences. This is not to suggest that only men struggle with their tempers. But men are more often socialized to believe that explosive anger and a pouty retreat into themselves are appropriate ways to communicate. I grew up never threatened with \"wait till your father gets home,\" never seeing one adult's needs prioritized over another's. I saw two adults treating each other with love, respect, and humor. I saw that it was possible to be a whole, healthy adult without marriage and, in my aunt's case, without biological children of one's own. Throughout my 30s, I was sympathetic, but somewhat baffled, as I watched some of my women friends struggle to make peace with their unmarried, unpartnered status. Many of them seemed to feel that kids were unlikely, since no partner was in sight, but their predicaments just looked to me like another way to do life. Because of my own upbringing, I felt liberated from the assumption that marriage and mothering must go together. Mainstream culture's glorification of marriage leaves so many people feeling unnecessarily deflated and out of options when that type of union doesn't materialize. 14 Also by Dani McClain What It's Like to Be Black and Pregnant When You Know How Dangerous That Can Be Dani McClain Can Black Lives Matter Win in the Age of Trump? Dani McClain Tarana Burke Talks About How to Support Survivors-When They're Your Kids Dani McClain Last Father's Day, I felt a swell of recognition when I saw black feminist writer Amber J. Phillips tweeting about her own father: \"Because he opted out of being [a] parent, I was raised with the radical idea that I don't actually need a patriarch in my home or life to be happy or feel a false sense of success.\" In her 1987 essay , \"The Meaning of Motherhood in Black Culture and Black Mother/Daughter Relationships,\" Patricia Hill Collins writes that growing up in a household like mine, in which working mothers and extended-family support are common, creates a kind of domino effect. Generation after generation, black women reject ideas that the patriarchal family-and, by extension, patriarchy in the broader society-is normal. Collins suggests that slavery and the economic realities of Jim Crow made it hard for black families to create the separate, gender-based spheres of influence (father as economic provider and head of household, mother as nurturer and subordinate) that white America lauded as the ideal organization of family life. Instead, black girls grow up with a sense of empowerment and possibility that girls of other races don't necessarily see modeled at home or in their communities. \"Since Black mothers have a distinctive relationship to white patriarchy, they may be less likely to socialize their daughters into their proscribed roles as subordinates,\" Collins writes. 15 Black families have developed a tradition of passing onto our children a culture that repels the forces of white supremacy and creates ample opportunities to question patriarchy. But unmarried black mothers and their daughters aren't lauded for holding the keys to resisting patriarchal oppression. Our reliance on extended family networks and collective approaches to childcare, our rejection of the nuclear family as the only way to organize our lives, has been consistently derided throughout history.

Just because a father isn't married to his child's mother doesn't mean he's an absent dad. 9 For my daughter's dad and me, it's not easy, but we work at it. For about six months after our breakup, we were in therapy to learn how to parent together despite our separation. I feel proud of us when I read a line from a 2008 study on co-parenting outside of marriage: \"We conclude that parents' ability to work together in rearing their common child across households helps keep nonresident fathers connected to their children and that programs aimed at improving parents' ability to communicate may have benefits for children irrespective of whether the parents' romantic relationship remains intact.\" We created our own program with the coaching of a black woman who talked us through some painful periods and helped us put our goals and commitments on paper. Now here we are-making the road by walking. 10 My father and my daughter's father are college-educated black men from middle-class families. They both grew up with their dads at home. At the time of their children's births, they were gainfully employed or training to advance in a profession. They were not ripped away by death or by the criminal-justice system or by the Pull of the StreetsTM. But not all black single moms have such a benign family backstory. For every 100 black women in communities around the country, there are just 83 black men. \"The remaining men-1.5 million of them-are, in a sense, missing,\" The New York Times reported in April 2015 , and incarceration and early death are to blame. There's no comparable gender gap for white people. For every 100 white women, there are 99 white men. But nearly one in 12 black men between the ages of 25 and 54 are behind bars, a rate that's five times that of nonblack men that age. The imbalance between free, living black boys and free, living black girls starts during their teen years and peaks in their 30s. (To be clear, black women are disproportionately incarcerated as well: One in 200 black women are behind bars, compared with one in 500 nonblack women.) These data help clarify why 30 percent of black families are headed by unmarried women, compared with 13 percent of American households overall. 11 G. Rosaline Preudhomme, a 73-year-old grandmother and organizer, helped pass Washington, DC's Initiative 71, which legalized marijuana. Preudhomme's work seeks to address the systemic reasons for these \"missing\" black men. Fifty thousand people were behind bars for nonviolent drug offenses in 1980. By 1997, that number had jumped to more than 400,000, close to where it remains today. A study by the Economic Policy Institute found that the incarceration of parents takes a serious toll on their children; children of incarcerated parents suffer from more physical and mental health problems than those whose parents aren't behind bars. Still, Preudhomme notes, despite the tremendous pressure that punitive drug policies have put on black communities in the past 40 years, our families persist. That's in part because black Americans have had a structure for organizing family life that predates the drug war and accommodates the absence or intermittent presence of parents. \"It's the resilient spirit of black women that has gotten us through these past 400 years of our family life always being disrupted,\" Preudhomme says. 12 Seeking humanity: Black parents have often had to remind the world that their slain children were in fact human beings. From left: Constance Malcolm, Gwen Carr, Hawa Bah, and Iris Baez all lost sons to police violence. (Sipa via AP) In taking a village-oriented approach to child-rearing, black Americans may be out of step with mainstream white, middle-class American culture, which became more centered on the nuclear family at the middle of the last century with the advent of mass suburbanization. But we're fully in step with how the rest of the world has functioned throughout most of history. A body of research has determined that Western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic countries, with their focus on the nuclear family, bring up children in what anthropologist David Lancy has called \"a departure from all other human culture.\" Most humans across time and space are \"cooperative breeders\" and depend on adult women and older children in the extended family and community to care for the young. 13 W hen I think about my own childhood growing up with my mom and my maternal aunt, the first words that come to mind are \"calm\" and \"even-keeled.\" In the decade before I left home for college, when the three of us lived together, I can remember only one or two times when there were raised voices or heavy silences. This is not to suggest that only men struggle with their tempers. But men are more often socialized to believe that explosive anger and a pouty retreat into themselves are appropriate ways to communicate. I grew up never threatened with \"wait till your father gets home,\" never seeing one adult's needs prioritized over another's. I saw two adults treating each other with love, respect, and humor. I saw that it was possible to be a whole, healthy adult without marriage and, in my aunt's case, without biological children of one's own. Throughout my 30s, I was sympathetic, but somewhat baffled, as I watched some of my women friends struggle to make peace with their unmarried, unpartnered status. Many of them seemed to feel that kids were unlikely, since no partner was in sight, but their predicaments just looked to me like another way to do life. Because of my own upbringing, I felt liberated from the assumption that marriage and mothering must go together. Mainstream culture's glorification of marriage leaves so many people feeling unnecessarily deflated and out of options when that type of union doesn't materialize. 14 Also by Dani McClain What It's Like to Be Black and Pregnant When You Know How Dangerous That Can Be Dani McClain Can Black Lives Matter Win in the Age of Trump? Dani McClain Tarana Burke Talks About How to Support Survivors-When They're Your Kids Dani McClain Last Father's Day, I felt a swell of recognition when I saw black feminist writer Amber J. Phillips tweeting about her own father: \"Because he opted out of being [a] parent, I was raised with the radical idea that I don't actually need a patriarch in my home or life to be happy or feel a false sense of success.\" In her 1987 essay , \"The Meaning of Motherhood in Black Culture and Black Mother/Daughter Relationships,\" Patricia Hill Collins writes that growing up in a household like mine, in which working mothers and extended-family support are common, creates a kind of domino effect. Generation after generation, black women reject ideas that the patriarchal family-and, by extension, patriarchy in the broader society-is normal. Collins suggests that slavery and the economic realities of Jim Crow made it hard for black families to create the separate, gender-based spheres of influence (father as economic provider and head of household, mother as nurturer and subordinate) that white America lauded as the ideal organization of family life. Instead, black girls grow up with a sense of empowerment and possibility that girls of other races don't necessarily see modeled at home or in their communities. \"Since Black mothers have a distinctive relationship to white patriarchy, they may be less likely to socialize their daughters into their proscribed roles as subordinates,\" Collins writes. 15 Black families have developed a tradition of passing onto our children a culture that repels the forces of white supremacy and creates ample opportunities to question patriarchy. But unmarried black mothers and their daughters aren't lauded for holding the keys to resisting patriarchal oppression. Our reliance on extended family networks and collective approaches to childcare, our rejection of the nuclear family as the only way to organize our lives, has been consistently derided throughout history. The dominant narrative is that we're poor, draining public coffers, and so a blight on society. The safety zones that black parents have created, with leadership from black mothers, the places where we learn that we are not who the world tells us we are, have been criticized by everyone from Daniel Patrick Moynihan in the 1960s to the American Enterprise Institute's W. Bradford Wilcox today. 16 Devoted dads: Black fathers are more likely than men of other races to read to, feed, bathe, and play with their young children on a daily basis, whether they live in the same home or not. (AP / David Goldman) Those who promote marriage as social policy want us to believe that getting married will automatically lift poor people out of poverty. But poor plus poor does not somehow equal middle class. It means two poor adults raising poor kids and trying to figure out how to survive. Lost in the conversation is the impact that low-wage work has on black families. The question shouldn't be whether we can put together two measly paychecks, but whether we as individuals can get paid a fair wage for the work that we do. In 2016, nearly 40 percent of black, female-headed households with children lived in poverty-meaning over 60 percent did not. Why don't we talk about how that 60 percent is often doing just fine, or why that 40 percent is actually impoverished? 17 Governments aren't equipped to understand all the pressures that low-income couples face, and they shouldn't presume to meddle in romantic relationships. What governments are equipped to do is address poverty head on, by acknowledging and supporting people's economic and social rights. Social policies such as paid parental leave, universal child care, and universal health care would go a long way to alleviate the financial pressures that unmarried moms face. This kind of government intervention is why a single mother and her child in Denmark are no more likely to be poor than a married mother and her child. 18 But the complex story of family formation and black mothering isn't only about beating back stigma and correcting falsehoods; the psychic and emotional impact of leading households on our own is often ignored. I've been guilty of this myself. In writing about black women and marriage in the past, I've failed to acknowledge that some of us actually aspire to the narratives of being chosen, of living happily ever after. Yes, it's important that we can and do successfully raise children without steady, committed romantic partners. But can we also note how depressing it is that we so often have to? There's a reason some black women were excited when finally, after 12 seasons of the franchise, there was a black Bachelorette . Some of us want love, marriage, and a baby carriage in exactly that order, and preferably with black men. It's important to acknowledge how it feels when those desires are often out of reach for us in a way they're just not for other women. 19 Poverty's true causes: Lost in the conversation about single parenthood and poverty is the impact of low-wage work on black families. No wonder so many Fight for $15 leaders are black women. Add to the existential angst the day-to-day responsibility of being in charge. Even with family help and enough money to pay for childcare, it's exhausting to be the sole adult responsible for cooking, bathing, reading, playing, and cleaning on those days or in those stretches of hours when you're going it alone. I never take it for granted that I was 100 percent certain I wanted to be a mother when I had my daughter. I can't imagine giving mothering the energy it demands and deserves if I had come into this reluctantly, especially now that it's often just the two of us. I enjoy the work of mothering and don't often feel like I'm going through the motions or putting on a brave face, but there have been times when my spirit has flagged under the weight. I'm reminded of those times, the moments I've blinked back tears, when I read asha bandele's memoir, Something Like Beautiful , about raising her daughter while her husband was incarcerated and then deported. She writes: \"I told myself if I cried I was setting a bad example for my daughter. Others told me the very same thing. Told me never to be a victim, Black women are not victims and we are not weak.... In the post-welfare-reform days of the alpha mom, I was clear that being a victim, showing any weakness, was punishable by complete isolation and total loss of respect. I was a mother, a single mother, a single Black mother. I was part of a tradition of women who do not bend and who do not break. This is what I said, this is how I now defined myself. As someone with no room for error.\" 20 I see little room for error in my own life. I have to guard against letting parenting become one more place I practice perfectionism. There are so many reasons to try to do it as close to perfectly as possible, since the mainstream conversation tells me that as both an unmarried mom and the child of an unmarried mom, I'm incapable of being or raising a successful, well-adjusted person. Even though I have known since childhood how mean-spirited and hollow that conversation is, I'm still affected by the stigma. As I get older, I can also see the danger in being too defensive, in disproving others' assumptions before I honestly explore my own nuanced truths. In 2007, artist Meshell Ndegeocello released an album called The World Has Made Me the Man of My Dreams . That album's title reminds me that learning to navigate an often-inhospitable world on one's own and with the help of relatives and friends can make us into our own rock-solid protectors. Partnership with a man can begin to feel unnecessary: nice when it comes along, but not a must for survival or happiness. This strength can be a source of pride, but it can also be reason to grieve when one starts to think about all the structural and historical reasons that black women have had to be so independent, and black men have often been unavailable or unwilling to offer meaningful help. 21 It's a February day, and Is and I are at the playground. I push her on the swing and notice that she can't take her eyes off the next swing over, where a dad is pushing his daughter. I think to myself: I know that feeling. That \"Why don't I have that?\" feeling. That \"Where's my dad?\" feeling. That \"I want bigger, messier, gruffer, rougher, and sillier than Mom\" feeling. But the truth is that I'm projecting. My child is a watcher; she's super-nosy and could be thinking anything. She actually gets playground time with her dad, though not daily. But my mind goes there because I am still, at 39, processing my own feelings around abandonment and loss. I don't want that for my daughter. I don't want her to know that sense of longing. If she does, I want her to know that she can express it, put it out in the open. In my experience, the silence around an absence can do more harm than the absence itself. For Is and for me, the challenge is to find-to make-space where we can be vulnerable and acknowledge hurt without giving into the narrative that we are of and in a \"broken family.\" As we are, our family is perfectly whole. 22\n\nDani McClain\n\nFamily is often the first social institution to shape how we understand our identities and our politics. At a time when \"Resist!\" has for some become a national battle cry in response to the norms-trampling Trump administration, it's critical to look at the messages communicated within our families and address hypocrisies or inconsistencies head on. Research suggests that white parents in particular need help seeing family as a source of political education, especially when it comes to passing on anti-racist values. A 2007 study in the Journal of Marriage and Family found that out of 17,000 families with kindergartners, parents of color are about three times more likely to discuss race than their white counterparts. Seventy-five percent of the white parents in the study never or almost never talked about race. According to research highlighted in Po Bronson and Ashley Merryman's 2009 book, NurtureShock , white parents communicate messages that skin color doesn't matter and that everyone is equal-messages that children know to be lies based on their own experiences even as early as infancy. When pressed, these parents often admit that they don't know how to talk about race. Black mothers, on the other hand, are scared not of talk of race, but of the impact of racist oppression. We're scared because we have no choice but to release our beloved creations into environments-doctors' offices, hospitals, day-care facilities, playgrounds, schools-where white supremacy is often woven into the fabric of the institution, and is both consciously and unwittingly practiced by the people acting in loco parentis. Black mothers haven't had the luxury of sticking our heads in the sand and hoping that our children learn about race and power as they go. Instead, we must act as a buffer and translator between them and the world, beginning from their earliest days. 6 The right to be a mother: Before Emancipation, enslaved women had no legal right to their children, and slave owners often severed kinship relations rooted in marriage or blood ties. (Library of Congress) I am the daughter of an unmarried black woman. I am now an unmarried black woman raising a girl. I didn't grow up with my father at home. As has been the case since soon after her first birthday, my daughter isn't either. I didn't meet my father until I was in my early 20s. Our meeting was healing, but his absence hadn't mattered in the ways that some people assumed it would. I grew up in a house in the suburbs, the same house where my mom and her sisters and their dad before them had grown up. My maternal grandmother had grown up around the corner. We had a big in-ground pool in the backyard, where I'd swim with my cousins and other neighborhood kids. I grew up playing soccer and riding horses and skiing, and on the few occasions that I was referred to jokingly as a \"Cosby kid,\" I knew what that meant: I was privileged, maybe even a little spoiled. 7 Current Issue View our current issue I always had a kind of unvarnished pride in my upbringing. None of the assumptions people seemed to have about families headed by \"single mothers\" applied to my life. As an only child, I was the focus of my mom's attention and resources. That investment in my success and happiness was supplemented by the love, time, and money of other adults in our family, especially my maternal aunt, Pam, who lived with my mom and me from the time I was 7. Extended family was everything, and while the word \"family\" seemed to mean a mom and dad and siblings to some, to me it's always meant aunts and uncles and cousins and grandparents and the neighborhood elders who watched you grow up. 8 Like me, my daughter is growing up without a dad at home, but the similarities in our experiences end there. My father lived across the country-he'd moved west before I was born to pursue a graduate degree-and we had no contact until I sought him out and initiated a conversation that led to us staying in touch for a few years. My daughter's dad also lives in a different city, but he was by my side during her birth and cared for her daily during the first year of her life, while we were still together romantically, and before he relocated for a job. He visits her often and video-chats with her daily, and they have a relationship that I support and that brings us all joy. Our family is not unique in this. In 2013, a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention corrected the misconception that black men disproportionately shirk their fatherly duties. Instead, black men are generally more likely than men of other races to read to, feed, bathe, and play with their young children on a daily basis, whether they live in the same home as the child or not. Relying on nonmarital birthrates to tell a story about parental involvement has built a false narrative. Just because a father isn't married to his child's mother doesn't mean he's an absent dad. 9 For my daughter's dad and me, it's not easy, but we work at it. For about six months after our breakup, we were in therapy to learn how to parent together despite our separation.

As has been the case since soon after her first birthday, my daughter isn't either. I didn't meet my father until I was in my early 20s. Our meeting was healing, but his absence hadn't mattered in the ways that some people assumed it would. I grew up in a house in the suburbs, the same house where my mom and her sisters and their dad before them had grown up. My maternal grandmother had grown up around the corner. We had a big in-ground pool in the backyard, where I'd swim with my cousins and other neighborhood kids. I grew up playing soccer and riding horses and skiing, and on the few occasions that I was referred to jokingly as a \"Cosby kid,\" I knew what that meant: I was privileged, maybe even a little spoiled. 7 Current Issue View our current issue I always had a kind of unvarnished pride in my upbringing. None of the assumptions people seemed to have about families headed by \"single mothers\" applied to my life. As an only child, I was the focus of my mom's attention and resources. That investment in my success and happiness was supplemented by the love, time, and money of other adults in our family, especially my maternal aunt, Pam, who lived with my mom and me from the time I was 7. Extended family was everything, and while the word \"family\" seemed to mean a mom and dad and siblings to some, to me it's always meant aunts and uncles and cousins and grandparents and the neighborhood elders who watched you grow up. 8 Like me, my daughter is growing up without a dad at home, but the similarities in our experiences end there. My father lived across the country-he'd moved west before I was born to pursue a graduate degree-and we had no contact until I sought him out and initiated a conversation that led to us staying in touch for a few years. My daughter's dad also lives in a different city, but he was by my side during her birth and cared for her daily during the first year of her life, while we were still together romantically, and before he relocated for a job. He visits her often and video-chats with her daily, and they have a relationship that I support and that brings us all joy. Our family is not unique in this. In 2013, a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention corrected the misconception that black men disproportionately shirk their fatherly duties. Instead, black men are generally more likely than men of other races to read to, feed, bathe, and play with their young children on a daily basis, whether they live in the same home as the child or not. Relying on nonmarital birthrates to tell a story about parental involvement has built a false narrative. Just because a father isn't married to his child's mother doesn't mean he's an absent dad. 9 For my daughter's dad and me, it's not easy, but we work at it. For about six months after our breakup, we were in therapy to learn how to parent together despite our separation. I feel proud of us when I read a line from a 2008 study on co-parenting outside of marriage: \"We conclude that parents' ability to work together in rearing their common child across households helps keep nonresident fathers connected to their children and that programs aimed at improving parents' ability to communicate may have benefits for children irrespective of whether the parents' romantic relationship remains intact.\" We created our own program with the coaching of a black woman who talked us through some painful periods and helped us put our goals and commitments on paper. Now here we are-making the road by walking. 10 My father and my daughter's father are college-educated black men from middle-class families. They both grew up with their dads at home. At the time of their children's births, they were gainfully employed or training to advance in a profession. They were not ripped away by death or by the criminal-justice system or by the Pull of the StreetsTM. But not all black single moms have such a benign family backstory. For every 100 black women in communities around the country, there are just 83 black men. \"The remaining men-1.5 million of them-are, in a sense, missing,\" The New York Times reported in April 2015 , and incarceration and early death are to blame. There's no comparable gender gap for white people. For every 100 white women, there are 99 white men. But nearly one in 12 black men between the ages of 25 and 54 are behind bars, a rate that's five times that of nonblack men that age. The imbalance between free, living black boys and free, living black girls starts during their teen years and peaks in their 30s. (To be clear, black women are disproportionately incarcerated as well: One in 200 black women are behind bars, compared with one in 500 nonblack women.) These data help clarify why 30 percent of black families are headed by unmarried women, compared with 13 percent of American households overall. 11 G. Rosaline Preudhomme, a 73-year-old grandmother and organizer, helped pass Washington, DC's Initiative 71, which legalized marijuana. Preudhomme's work seeks to address the systemic reasons for these \"missing\" black men. Fifty thousand people were behind bars for nonviolent drug offenses in 1980. By 1997, that number had jumped to more than 400,000, close to where it remains today. A study by the Economic Policy Institute found that the incarceration of parents takes a serious toll on their children; children of incarcerated parents suffer from more physical and mental health problems than those whose parents aren't behind bars. Still, Preudhomme notes, despite the tremendous pressure that punitive drug policies have put on black communities in the past 40 years, our families persist. That's in part because black Americans have had a structure for organizing family life that predates the drug war and accommodates the absence or intermittent presence of parents. \"It's the resilient spirit of black women that has gotten us through these past 400 years of our family life always being disrupted,\" Preudhomme says. 12 Seeking humanity: Black parents have often had to remind the world that their slain children were in fact human beings. From left: Constance Malcolm, Gwen Carr, Hawa Bah, and Iris Baez all lost sons to police violence. (Sipa via AP) In taking a village-oriented approach to child-rearing, black Americans may be out of step with mainstream white, middle-class American culture, which became more centered on the nuclear family at the middle of the last century with the advent of mass suburbanization. But we're fully in step with how the rest of the world has functioned throughout most of history. A body of research has determined that Western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic countries, with their focus on the nuclear family, bring up children in what anthropologist David Lancy has called \"a departure from all other human culture.\" Most humans across time and space are \"cooperative breeders\" and depend on adult women and older children in the extended family and community to care for the young. 13 W hen I think about my own childhood growing up with my mom and my maternal aunt, the first words that come to mind are \"calm\" and \"even-keeled.\" In the decade before I left home for college, when the three of us lived together, I can remember only one or two times when there were raised voices or heavy silences. This is not to suggest that only men struggle with their tempers. But men are more often socialized to believe that explosive anger and a pouty retreat into themselves are appropriate ways to communicate. I grew up never threatened with \"wait till your father gets home,\" never seeing one adult's needs prioritized over another's. I saw two adults treating each other with love, respect, and humor. I saw that it was possible to be a whole, healthy adult without marriage and, in my aunt's case, without biological children of one's own. Throughout my 30s, I was sympathetic, but somewhat baffled, as I watched some of my women friends struggle to make peace with their unmarried, unpartnered status. Many of them seemed to feel that kids were unlikely, since no partner was in sight, but their predicaments just looked to me like another way to do life. Because of my own upbringing, I felt liberated from the assumption that marriage and mothering must go together. Mainstream culture's glorification of marriage leaves so many people feeling unnecessarily deflated and out of options when that type of union doesn't materialize. 14 Also by Dani McClain What It's Like to Be Black and Pregnant When You Know How Dangerous That Can Be Dani McClain Can Black Lives Matter Win in the Age of Trump? Dani McClain Tarana Burke Talks About How to Support Survivors-When They're Your Kids Dani McClain Last Father's Day, I felt a swell of recognition when I saw black feminist writer Amber J. Phillips tweeting about her own father: \"Because he opted out of being [a] parent, I was raised with the radical idea that I don't actually need a patriarch in my home or life to be happy or feel a false sense of success.\" In her 1987 essay , \"The Meaning of Motherhood in Black Culture and Black Mother/Daughter Relationships,\" Patricia Hill Collins writes that growing up in a household like mine, in which working mothers and extended-family support are common, creates a kind of domino effect. Generation after generation, black women reject ideas that the patriarchal family-and, by extension, patriarchy in the broader society-is normal. Collins suggests that slavery and the economic realities of Jim Crow made it hard for black families to create the separate, gender-based spheres of influence (father as economic provider and head of household, mother as nurturer and subordinate) that white America lauded as the ideal organization of family life. Instead, black girls grow up with a sense of empowerment and possibility that girls of other races don't necessarily see modeled at home or in their communities. \"Since Black mothers have a distinctive relationship to white patriarchy, they may be less likely to socialize their daughters into their proscribed roles as subordinates,\" Collins writes. 15 Black families have developed a tradition of passing onto our children a culture that repels the forces of white supremacy and creates ample opportunities to question patriarchy. But unmarried black mothers and their daughters aren't lauded for holding the keys to resisting patriarchal oppression. Our reliance on extended family networks and collective approaches to childcare, our rejection of the nuclear family as the only way to organize our lives, has been consistently derided throughout history. The dominant narrative is that we're poor, draining public coffers, and so a blight on society. The safety zones that black parents have created, with leadership from black mothers, the places where we learn that we are not who the world tells us we are, have been criticized by everyone from Daniel Patrick Moynihan in the 1960s to the American Enterprise Institute's W. Bradford Wilcox today. 16 Devoted dads: Black fathers are more likely than men of other races to read to, feed, bathe, and play with their young children on a daily basis, whether they live in the same home or not. (AP / David Goldman) Those who promote marriage as social policy want us to believe that getting married will automatically lift poor people out of poverty. But poor plus poor does not somehow equal middle class. It means two poor adults raising poor kids and trying to figure out how to survive. Lost in the conversation is the impact that low-wage work has on black families. The question shouldn't be whether we can put together two measly paychecks, but whether we as individuals can get paid a fair wage for the work that we do. In 2016, nearly 40 percent of black, female-headed households with children lived in poverty-meaning over 60 percent did not. Why don't we talk about how that 60 percent is often doing just fine, or why that 40 percent is actually impoverished? 17 Governments aren't equipped to understand all the pressures that low-income couples face, and they shouldn't presume to meddle in romantic relationships. What governments are equipped to do is address poverty head on, by acknowledging and supporting people's economic and social rights. Social policies such as paid parental leave, universal child care, and universal health care would go a long way to alleviate the financial pressures that unmarried moms face. This kind of government intervention is why a single mother and her child in Denmark are no more likely to be poor than a married mother and her child. 18 But the complex story of family formation and black mothering isn't only about beating back stigma and correcting falsehoods; the psychic and emotional impact of leading households on our own is often ignored. I've been guilty of this myself. In writing about black women and marriage in the past, I've failed to acknowledge that some of us actually aspire to the narratives of being chosen, of living happily ever after. Yes, it's important that we can and do successfully raise children without steady, committed romantic partners. But can we also note how depressing it is that we so often have to? There's a reason some black women were excited when finally, after 12 seasons of the franchise, there was a black Bachelorette . Some of us want love, marriage, and a baby carriage in exactly that order, and preferably with black men. It's important to acknowledge how it feels when those desires are often out of reach for us in a way they're just not for other women. 19 Poverty's true causes: Lost in the conversation about single parenthood and poverty is the impact of low-wage work on black families. No wonder so many Fight for $15 leaders are black women. Add to the existential angst the day-to-day responsibility of being in charge. Even with family help and enough money to pay for childcare, it's exhausting to be the sole adult responsible for cooking, bathing, reading, playing, and cleaning on those days or in those stretches of hours when you're going it alone. I never take it for granted that I was 100 percent certain I wanted to be a mother when I had my daughter. I can't imagine giving mothering the energy it demands and deserves if I had come into this reluctantly, especially now that it's often just the two of us. I enjoy the work of mothering and don't often feel like I'm going through the motions or putting on a brave face, but there have been times when my spirit has flagged under the weight. I'm reminded of those times, the moments I've blinked back tears, when I read asha bandele's memoir, Something Like Beautiful , about raising her daughter while her husband was incarcerated and then deported. She writes: \"I told myself if I cried I was setting a bad example for my daughter. Others told me the very same thing. Told me never to be a victim, Black women are not victims and we are not weak.... In the post-welfare-reform days of the alpha mom, I was clear that being a victim, showing any weakness, was punishable by complete isolation and total loss of respect. I was a mother, a single mother, a single Black mother. I was part of a tradition of women who do not bend and who do not break. This is what I said, this is how I now defined myself. As someone with no room for error.\" 20 I see little room for error in my own life. I have to guard against letting parenting become one more place I practice perfectionism. There are so many reasons to try to do it as close to perfectly as possible, since the mainstream conversation tells me that as both an unmarried mom and the child of an unmarried mom, I'm incapable of being or raising a successful, well-adjusted person. Even though I have known since childhood how mean-spirited and hollow that conversation is, I'm still affected by the stigma. As I get older, I can also see the danger in being too defensive, in disproving others' assumptions before I honestly explore my own nuanced truths. In 2007, artist Meshell Ndegeocello released an album called The World Has Made Me the Man of My Dreams . That album's title reminds me that learning to navigate an often-inhospitable world on one's own and with the help of relatives and friends can make us into our own rock-solid protectors. Partnership with a man can begin to feel unnecessary: nice when it comes along, but not a must for survival or happiness. This strength can be a source of pride, but it can also be reason to grieve when one starts to think about all the structural and historical reasons that black women have had to be so independent, and black men have often been unavailable or unwilling to offer meaningful help. 21 It's a February day, and Is and I are at the playground. I push her on the swing and notice that she can't take her eyes off the next swing over, where a dad is pushing his daughter. I think to myself: I know that feeling. That \"Why don't I have that?\" feeling. That \"Where's my dad?\" feeling. That \"I want bigger, messier, gruffer, rougher, and sillier than Mom\" feeling. But the truth is that I'm projecting. My child is a watcher; she's super-nosy and could be thinking anything. She actually gets playground time with her dad, though not daily. But my mind goes there because I am still, at 39, processing my own feelings around abandonment and loss. I don't want that for my daughter. I don't want her to know that sense of longing. If she does, I want her to know that she can express it, put it out in the open. In my experience, the silence around an absence can do more harm than the absence itself. For Is and for me, the challenge is to find-to make-space where we can be vulnerable and acknowledge hurt without giving into the narrative that we are of and in a \"broken family.\" As we are, our family is perfectly whole. 22\n\nI always had a kind of unvarnished pride in my upbringing.

My daughter's dad also lives in a different city, but he was by my side during her birth and cared for her daily during the first year of her life, while we were still together romantically, and before he relocated for a job. He visits her often and video-chats with her daily, and they have a relationship that I support and that brings us all joy. Our family is not unique in this. In 2013, a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention corrected the misconception that black men disproportionately shirk their fatherly duties. Instead, black men are generally more likely than men of other races to read to, feed, bathe, and play with their young children on a daily basis, whether they live in the same home as the child or not. Relying on nonmarital birthrates to tell a story about parental involvement has built a false narrative. Just because a father isn't married to his child's mother doesn't mean he's an absent dad. 9 For my daughter's dad and me, it's not easy, but we work at it. For about six months after our breakup, we were in therapy to learn how to parent together despite our separation. I feel proud of us when I read a line from a 2008 study on co-parenting outside of marriage: \"We conclude that parents' ability to work together in rearing their common child across households helps keep nonresident fathers connected to their children and that programs aimed at improving parents' ability to communicate may have benefits for children irrespective of whether the parents' romantic relationship remains intact.\" We created our own program with the coaching of a black woman who talked us through some painful periods and helped us put our goals and commitments on paper. Now here we are-making the road by walking. 10 My father and my daughter's father are college-educated black men from middle-class families. They both grew up with their dads at home. At the time of their children's births, they were gainfully employed or training to advance in a profession. They were not ripped away by death or by the criminal-justice system or by the Pull of the StreetsTM. But not all black single moms have such a benign family backstory. For every 100 black women in communities around the country, there are just 83 black men. \"The remaining men-1.5 million of them-are, in a sense, missing,\" The New York Times reported in April 2015 , and incarceration and early death are to blame. There's no comparable gender gap for white people. For every 100 white women, there are 99 white men. But nearly one in 12 black men between the ages of 25 and 54 are behind bars, a rate that's five times that of nonblack men that age. The imbalance between free, living black boys and free, living black girls starts during their teen years and peaks in their 30s. (To be clear, black women are disproportionately incarcerated as well: One in 200 black women are behind bars, compared with one in 500 nonblack women.) These data help clarify why 30 percent of black families are headed by unmarried women, compared with 13 percent of American households overall. 11 G. Rosaline Preudhomme, a 73-year-old grandmother and organizer, helped pass Washington, DC's Initiative 71, which legalized marijuana. Preudhomme's work seeks to address the systemic reasons for these \"missing\" black men. Fifty thousand people were behind bars for nonviolent drug offenses in 1980. By 1997, that number had jumped to more than 400,000, close to where it remains today. A study by the Economic Policy Institute found that the incarceration of parents takes a serious toll on their children; children of incarcerated parents suffer from more physical and mental health problems than those whose parents aren't behind bars. Still, Preudhomme notes, despite the tremendous pressure that punitive drug policies have put on black communities in the past 40 years, our families persist. That's in part because black Americans have had a structure for organizing family life that predates the drug war and accommodates the absence or intermittent presence of parents. \"It's the resilient spirit of black women that has gotten us through these past 400 years of our family life always being disrupted,\" Preudhomme says. 12 Seeking humanity: Black parents have often had to remind the world that their slain children were in fact human beings. From left: Constance Malcolm, Gwen Carr, Hawa Bah, and Iris Baez all lost sons to police violence. (Sipa via AP) In taking a village-oriented approach to child-rearing, black Americans may be out of step with mainstream white, middle-class American culture, which became more centered on the nuclear family at the middle of the last century with the advent of mass suburbanization. But we're fully in step with how the rest of the world has functioned throughout most of history. A body of research has determined that Western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic countries, with their focus on the nuclear family, bring up children in what anthropologist David Lancy has called \"a departure from all other human culture.\" Most humans across time and space are \"cooperative breeders\" and depend on adult women and older children in the extended family and community to care for the young. 13 W hen I think about my own childhood growing up with my mom and my maternal aunt, the first words that come to mind are \"calm\" and \"even-keeled.\" In the decade before I left home for college, when the three of us lived together, I can remember only one or two times when there were raised voices or heavy silences. This is not to suggest that only men struggle with their tempers. But men are more often socialized to believe that explosive anger and a pouty retreat into themselves are appropriate ways to communicate. I grew up never threatened with \"wait till your father gets home,\" never seeing one adult's needs prioritized over another's. I saw two adults treating each other with love, respect, and humor. I saw that it was possible to be a whole, healthy adult without marriage and, in my aunt's case, without biological children of one's own. Throughout my 30s, I was sympathetic, but somewhat baffled, as I watched some of my women friends struggle to make peace with their unmarried, unpartnered status. Many of them seemed to feel that kids were unlikely, since no partner was in sight, but their predicaments just looked to me like another way to do life. Because of my own upbringing, I felt liberated from the assumption that marriage and mothering must go together. Mainstream culture's glorification of marriage leaves so many people feeling unnecessarily deflated and out of options when that type of union doesn't materialize. 14 Also by Dani McClain What It's Like to Be Black and Pregnant When You Know How Dangerous That Can Be Dani McClain Can Black Lives Matter Win in the Age of Trump? Dani McClain Tarana Burke Talks About How to Support Survivors-When They're Your Kids Dani McClain Last Father's Day, I felt a swell of recognition when I saw black feminist writer Amber J. Phillips tweeting about her own father: \"Because he opted out of being [a] parent, I was raised with the radical idea that I don't actually need a patriarch in my home or life to be happy or feel a false sense of success.\" In her 1987 essay , \"The Meaning of Motherhood in Black Culture and Black Mother/Daughter Relationships,\" Patricia Hill Collins writes that growing up in a household like mine, in which working mothers and extended-family support are common, creates a kind of domino effect. Generation after generation, black women reject ideas that the patriarchal family-and, by extension, patriarchy in the broader society-is normal. Collins suggests that slavery and the economic realities of Jim Crow made it hard for black families to create the separate, gender-based spheres of influence (father as economic provider and head of household, mother as nurturer and subordinate) that white America lauded as the ideal organization of family life. Instead, black girls grow up with a sense of empowerment and possibility that girls of other races don't necessarily see modeled at home or in their communities. \"Since Black mothers have a distinctive relationship to white patriarchy, they may be less likely to socialize their daughters into their proscribed roles as subordinates,\" Collins writes. 15 Black families have developed a tradition of passing onto our children a culture that repels the forces of white supremacy and creates ample opportunities to question patriarchy. But unmarried black mothers and their daughters aren't lauded for holding the keys to resisting patriarchal oppression. Our reliance on extended family networks and collective approaches to childcare, our rejection of the nuclear family as the only way to organize our lives, has been consistently derided throughout history. The dominant narrative is that we're poor, draining public coffers, and so a blight on society. The safety zones that black parents have created, with leadership from black mothers, the places where we learn that we are not who the world tells us we are, have been criticized by everyone from Daniel Patrick Moynihan in the 1960s to the American Enterprise Institute's W. Bradford Wilcox today. 16 Devoted dads: Black fathers are more likely than men of other races to read to, feed, bathe, and play with their young children on a daily basis, whether they live in the same home or not. (AP / David Goldman) Those who promote marriage as social policy want us to believe that getting married will automatically lift poor people out of poverty. But poor plus poor does not somehow equal middle class. It means two poor adults raising poor kids and trying to figure out how to survive. Lost in the conversation is the impact that low-wage work has on black families. The question shouldn't be whether we can put together two measly paychecks, but whether we as individuals can get paid a fair wage for the work that we do. In 2016, nearly 40 percent of black, female-headed households with children lived in poverty-meaning over 60 percent did not. Why don't we talk about how that 60 percent is often doing just fine, or why that 40 percent is actually impoverished? 17 Governments aren't equipped to understand all the pressures that low-income couples face, and they shouldn't presume to meddle in romantic relationships. What governments are equipped to do is address poverty head on, by acknowledging and supporting people's economic and social rights. Social policies such as paid parental leave, universal child care, and universal health care would go a long way to alleviate the financial pressures that unmarried moms face. This kind of government intervention is why a single mother and her child in Denmark are no more likely to be poor than a married mother and her child. 18 But the complex story of family formation and black mothering isn't only about beating back stigma and correcting falsehoods; the psychic and emotional impact of leading households on our own is often ignored. I've been guilty of this myself. In writing about black women and marriage in the past, I've failed to acknowledge that some of us actually aspire to the narratives of being chosen, of living happily ever after. Yes, it's important that we can and do successfully raise children without steady, committed romantic partners. But can we also note how depressing it is that we so often have to? There's a reason some black women were excited when finally, after 12 seasons of the franchise, there was a black Bachelorette . Some of us want love, marriage, and a baby carriage in exactly that order, and preferably with black men. It's important to acknowledge how it feels when those desires are often out of reach for us in a way they're just not for other women. 19 Poverty's true causes: Lost in the conversation about single parenthood and poverty is the impact of low-wage work on black families. No wonder so many Fight for $15 leaders are black women. Add to the existential angst the day-to-day responsibility of being in charge. Even with family help and enough money to pay for childcare, it's exhausting to be the sole adult responsible for cooking, bathing, reading, playing, and cleaning on those days or in those stretches of hours when you're going it alone. I never take it for granted that I was 100 percent certain I wanted to be a mother when I had my daughter. I can't imagine giving mothering the energy it demands and deserves if I had come into this reluctantly, especially now that it's often just the two of us. I enjoy the work of mothering and don't often feel like I'm going through the motions or putting on a brave face, but there have been times when my spirit has flagged under the weight. I'm reminded of those times, the moments I've blinked back tears, when I read asha bandele's memoir, Something Like Beautiful , about raising her daughter while her husband was incarcerated and then deported. She writes: \"I told myself if I cried I was setting a bad example for my daughter. Others told me the very same thing. Told me never to be a victim, Black women are not victims and we are not weak.... In the post-welfare-reform days of the alpha mom, I was clear that being a victim, showing any weakness, was punishable by complete isolation and total loss of respect. I was a mother, a single mother, a single Black mother. I was part of a tradition of women who do not bend and who do not break. This is what I said, this is how I now defined myself. As someone with no room for error.\" 20 I see little room for error in my own life. I have to guard against letting parenting become one more place I practice perfectionism. There are so many reasons to try to do it as close to perfectly as possible, since the mainstream conversation tells me that as both an unmarried mom and the child of an unmarried mom, I'm incapable of being or raising a successful, well-adjusted person. Even though I have known since childhood how mean-spirited and hollow that conversation is, I'm still affected by the stigma. As I get older, I can also see the danger in being too defensive, in disproving others' assumptions before I honestly explore my own nuanced truths. In 2007, artist Meshell Ndegeocello released an album called The World Has Made Me the Man of My Dreams . That album's title reminds me that learning to navigate an often-inhospitable world on one's own and with the help of relatives and friends can make us into our own rock-solid protectors. Partnership with a man can begin to feel unnecessary: nice when it comes along, but not a must for survival or happiness. This strength can be a source of pride, but it can also be reason to grieve when one starts to think about all the structural and historical reasons that black women have had to be so independent, and black men have often been unavailable or unwilling to offer meaningful help. 21 It's a February day, and Is and I are at the playground. I push her on the swing and notice that she can't take her eyes off the next swing over, where a dad is pushing his daughter. I think to myself: I know that feeling. That \"Why don't I have that?\" feeling. That \"Where's my dad?\" feeling. That \"I want bigger, messier, gruffer, rougher, and sillier than Mom\" feeling. But the truth is that I'm projecting. My child is a watcher; she's super-nosy and could be thinking anything. She actually gets playground time with her dad, though not daily. But my mind goes there because I am still, at 39, processing my own feelings around abandonment and loss. I don't want that for my daughter. I don't want her to know that sense of longing. If she does, I want her to know that she can express it, put it out in the open. In my experience, the silence around an absence can do more harm than the absence itself. For Is and for me, the challenge is to find-to make-space where we can be vulnerable and acknowledge hurt without giving into the narrative that we are of and in a \"broken family.\" As we are, our family is perfectly whole. 22\n\nFor my daughter's dad and me, it's not easy, but we work at it.

I grew up never threatened with \"wait till your father gets home,\" never seeing one adult's needs prioritized over another's. I saw two adults treating each other with love, respect, and humor. I saw that it was possible to be a whole, healthy adult without marriage and, in my aunt's case, without biological children of one's own. Throughout my 30s, I was sympathetic, but somewhat baffled, as I watched some of my women friends struggle to make peace with their unmarried, unpartnered status. Many of them seemed to feel that kids were unlikely, since no partner was in sight, but their predicaments just looked to me like another way to do life. Because of my own upbringing, I felt liberated from the assumption that marriage and mothering must go together. Mainstream culture's glorification of marriage leaves so many people feeling unnecessarily deflated and out of options when that type of union doesn't materialize. 14 Also by Dani McClain What It's Like to Be Black and Pregnant When You Know How Dangerous That Can Be Dani McClain Can Black Lives Matter Win in the Age of Trump? Dani McClain Tarana Burke Talks About How to Support Survivors-When They're Your Kids Dani McClain Last Father's Day, I felt a swell of recognition when I saw black feminist writer Amber J. Phillips tweeting about her own father: \"Because he opted out of being [a] parent, I was raised with the radical idea that I don't actually need a patriarch in my home or life to be happy or feel a false sense of success.\" In her 1987 essay , \"The Meaning of Motherhood in Black Culture and Black Mother/Daughter Relationships,\" Patricia Hill Collins writes that growing up in a household like mine, in which working mothers and extended-family support are common, creates a kind of domino effect. Generation after generation, black women reject ideas that the patriarchal family-and, by extension, patriarchy in the broader society-is normal. Collins suggests that slavery and the economic realities of Jim Crow made it hard for black families to create the separate, gender-based spheres of influence (father as economic provider and head of household, mother as nurturer and subordinate) that white America lauded as the ideal organization of family life. Instead, black girls grow up with a sense of empowerment and possibility that girls of other races don't necessarily see modeled at home or in their communities. \"Since Black mothers have a distinctive relationship to white patriarchy, they may be less likely to socialize their daughters into their proscribed roles as subordinates,\" Collins writes. 15 Black families have developed a tradition of passing onto our children a culture that repels the forces of white supremacy and creates ample opportunities to question patriarchy. But unmarried black mothers and their daughters aren't lauded for holding the keys to resisting patriarchal oppression. Our reliance on extended family networks and collective approaches to childcare, our rejection of the nuclear family as the only way to organize our lives, has been consistently derided throughout history. The dominant narrative is that we're poor, draining public coffers, and so a blight on society. The safety zones that black parents have created, with leadership from black mothers, the places where we learn that we are not who the world tells us we are, have been criticized by everyone from Daniel Patrick Moynihan in the 1960s to the American Enterprise Institute's W. Bradford Wilcox today. 16 Devoted dads: Black fathers are more likely than men of other races to read to, feed, bathe, and play with their young children on a daily basis, whether they live in the same home or not. (AP / David Goldman) Those who promote marriage as social policy want us to believe that getting married will automatically lift poor people out of poverty. But poor plus poor does not somehow equal middle class. It means two poor adults raising poor kids and trying to figure out how to survive. Lost in the conversation is the impact that low-wage work has on black families. The question shouldn't be whether we can put together two measly paychecks, but whether we as individuals can get paid a fair wage for the work that we do. In 2016, nearly 40 percent of black, female-headed households with children lived in poverty-meaning over 60 percent did not. Why don't we talk about how that 60 percent is often doing just fine, or why that 40 percent is actually impoverished? 17 Governments aren't equipped to understand all the pressures that low-income couples face, and they shouldn't presume to meddle in romantic relationships. What governments are equipped to do is address poverty head on, by acknowledging and supporting people's economic and social rights. Social policies such as paid parental leave, universal child care, and universal health care would go a long way to alleviate the financial pressures that unmarried moms face. This kind of government intervention is why a single mother and her child in Denmark are no more likely to be poor than a married mother and her child. 18 But the complex story of family formation and black mothering isn't only about beating back stigma and correcting falsehoods; the psychic and emotional impact of leading households on our own is often ignored. I've been guilty of this myself. In writing about black women and marriage in the past, I've failed to acknowledge that some of us actually aspire to the narratives of being chosen, of living happily ever after. Yes, it's important that we can and do successfully raise children without steady, committed romantic partners. But can we also note how depressing it is that we so often have to? There's a reason some black women were excited when finally, after 12 seasons of the franchise, there was a black Bachelorette . Some of us want love, marriage, and a baby carriage in exactly that order, and preferably with black men. It's important to acknowledge how it feels when those desires are often out of reach for us in a way they're just not for other women. 19 Poverty's true causes: Lost in the conversation about single parenthood and poverty is the impact of low-wage work on black families. No wonder so many Fight for $15 leaders are black women. Add to the existential angst the day-to-day responsibility of being in charge. Even with family help and enough money to pay for childcare, it's exhausting to be the sole adult responsible for cooking, bathing, reading, playing, and cleaning on those days or in those stretches of hours when you're going it alone. I never take it for granted that I was 100 percent certain I wanted to be a mother when I had my daughter. I can't imagine giving mothering the energy it demands and deserves if I had come into this reluctantly, especially now that it's often just the two of us. I enjoy the work of mothering and don't often feel like I'm going through the motions or putting on a brave face, but there have been times when my spirit has flagged under the weight. I'm reminded of those times, the moments I've blinked back tears, when I read asha bandele's memoir, Something Like Beautiful , about raising her daughter while her husband was incarcerated and then deported. She writes: \"I told myself if I cried I was setting a bad example for my daughter. Others told me the very same thing. Told me never to be a victim, Black women are not victims and we are not weak.... In the post-welfare-reform days of the alpha mom, I was clear that being a victim, showing any weakness, was punishable by complete isolation and total loss of respect. I was a mother, a single mother, a single Black mother. I was part of a tradition of women who do not bend and who do not break. This is what I said, this is how I now defined myself. As someone with no room for error.\" 20 I see little room for error in my own life. I have to guard against letting parenting become one more place I practice perfectionism. There are so many reasons to try to do it as close to perfectly as possible, since the mainstream conversation tells me that as both an unmarried mom and the child of an unmarried mom, I'm incapable of being or raising a successful, well-adjusted person. Even though I have known since childhood how mean-spirited and hollow that conversation is, I'm still affected by the stigma. As I get older, I can also see the danger in being too defensive, in disproving others' assumptions before I honestly explore my own nuanced truths. In 2007, artist Meshell Ndegeocello released an album called The World Has Made Me the Man of My Dreams . That album's title reminds me that learning to navigate an often-inhospitable world on one's own and with the help of relatives and friends can make us into our own rock-solid protectors. Partnership with a man can begin to feel unnecessary: nice when it comes along, but not a must for survival or happiness. This strength can be a source of pride, but it can also be reason to grieve when one starts to think about all the structural and historical reasons that black women have had to be so independent, and black men have often been unavailable or unwilling to offer meaningful help. 21 It's a February day, and Is and I are at the playground. I push her on the swing and notice that she can't take her eyes off the next swing over, where a dad is pushing his daughter. I think to myself: I know that feeling. That \"Why don't I have that?\" feeling. That \"Where's my dad?\" feeling. That \"I want bigger, messier, gruffer, rougher, and sillier than Mom\" feeling. But the truth is that I'm projecting. My child is a watcher; she's super-nosy and could be thinking anything. She actually gets playground time with her dad, though not daily. But my mind goes there because I am still, at 39, processing my own feelings around abandonment and loss. I don't want that for my daughter. I don't want her to know that sense of longing. If she does, I want her to know that she can express it, put it out in the open. In my experience, the silence around an absence can do more harm than the absence itself. For Is and for me, the challenge is to find-to make-space where we can be vulnerable and acknowledge hurt without giving into the narrative that we are of and in a \"broken family.\" As we are, our family is perfectly whole. 22\n\nG. Rosaline Preudhomme, a 73-year-old grandmother and organizer, helped pass Washington, DC's Initiative 71, which legalized marijuana. Preudhomme's work seeks to address the systemic reasons for these \"missing\" black men. Fifty thousand people were behind bars for nonviolent drug offenses in 1980. By 1997, that number had jumped to more than 400,000, close to where it remains today. A study by the Economic Policy Institute found that the incarceration of parents takes a serious toll on their children; children of incarcerated parents suffer from more physical and mental health problems than those whose parents aren't behind bars. Still, Preudhomme notes, despite the tremendous pressure that punitive drug policies have put on black communities in the past 40 years, our families persist. That's in part because black Americans have had a structure for organizing family life that predates the drug war and accommodates the absence or intermittent presence of parents. \"It's the resilient spirit of black women that has gotten us through these past 400 years of our family life always being disrupted,\" Preudhomme says. 12 Seeking humanity: Black parents have often had to remind the world that their slain children were in fact human beings. From left: Constance Malcolm, Gwen Carr, Hawa Bah, and Iris Baez all lost sons to police violence. (Sipa via AP) In taking a village-oriented approach to child-rearing, black Americans may be out of step with mainstream white, middle-class American culture, which became more centered on the nuclear family at the middle of the last century with the advent of mass suburbanization. But we're fully in step with how the rest of the world has functioned throughout most of history. A body of research has determined that Western, educated, industrialized, rich, democratic countries, with their focus on the nuclear family, bring up children in what anthropologist David Lancy has called \"a departure from all other human culture.\" Most humans across time and space are \"cooperative breeders\" and depend on adult women and older children in the extended family and community to care for the young. 13 W hen I think about my own childhood growing up with my mom and my maternal aunt, the first words that come to mind are \"calm\" and \"even-keeled.\" In the decade before I left home for college, when the three of us lived together, I can remember only one or two times when there were raised voices or heavy silences. This is not to suggest that only men struggle with their tempers. But men are more often socialized to believe that explosive anger and a pouty retreat into themselves are appropriate ways to communicate.

I saw that it was possible to be a whole, healthy adult without marriage and, in my aunt's case, without biological children of one's own. Throughout my 30s, I was sympathetic, but somewhat baffled, as I watched some of my women friends struggle to make peace with their unmarried, unpartnered status. Many of them seemed to feel that kids were unlikely, since no partner was in sight, but their predicaments just looked to me like another way to do life. Because of my own upbringing, I felt liberated from the assumption that marriage and mothering must go together. Mainstream culture's glorification of marriage leaves so many people feeling unnecessarily deflated and out of options when that type of union doesn't materialize. 14 Also by Dani McClain What It's Like to Be Black and Pregnant When You Know How Dangerous That Can Be Dani McClain Can Black Lives Matter Win in the Age of Trump?

Phillips tweeting about her own father: \"Because he opted out of being [a] parent, I was raised with the radical idea that I don't actually need a patriarch in my home or life to be happy or feel a false sense of success.\" In her 1987 essay , \"The Meaning of Motherhood in Black Culture and Black Mother/Daughter Relationships,\" Patricia Hill Collins writes that growing up in a household like mine, in which working mothers and extended-family support are common, creates a kind of domino effect. Generation after generation, black women reject ideas that the patriarchal family-and, by extension, patriarchy in the broader society-is normal. Collins suggests that slavery and the economic realities of Jim Crow made it hard for black families to create the separate, gender-based spheres of influence (father as economic provider and head of household, mother as nurturer and subordinate) that white America lauded as the ideal organization of family life. Instead, black girls grow up with a sense of empowerment and possibility that girls of other races don't necessarily see modeled at home or in their communities. \"Since Black mothers have a distinctive relationship to white patriarchy, they may be less likely to socialize their daughters into their proscribed roles as subordinates,\" Collins writes. 15 Black families have developed a tradition of passing onto our children a culture that repels the forces of white supremacy and creates ample opportunities to question patriarchy. But unmarried black mothers and their daughters aren't lauded for holding the keys to resisting patriarchal oppression. Our reliance on extended family networks and collective approaches to childcare, our rejection of the nuclear family as the only way to organize our lives, has been consistently derided throughout history. The dominant narrative is that we're poor, draining public coffers, and so a blight on society. The safety zones that black parents have created, with leadership from black mothers, the places where we learn that we are not who the world tells us we are, have been criticized by everyone from Daniel Patrick Moynihan in the 1960s to the American Enterprise Institute's W. Bradford Wilcox today. 16 Devoted dads: Black fathers are more likely than men of other races to read to, feed, bathe, and play with their young children on a daily basis, whether they live in the same home or not. (AP / David Goldman) Those who promote marriage as social policy want us to believe that getting married will automatically lift poor people out of poverty. But poor plus poor does not somehow equal middle class. It means two poor adults raising poor kids and trying to figure out how to survive. Lost in the conversation is the impact that low-wage work has on black families. The question shouldn't be whether we can put together two measly paychecks, but whether we as individuals can get paid a fair wage for the work that we do. In 2016, nearly 40 percent of black, female-headed households with children lived in poverty-meaning over 60 percent did not. Why don't we talk about how that 60 percent is often doing just fine, or why that 40 percent is actually impoverished? 17 Governments aren't equipped to understand all the pressures that low-income couples face, and they shouldn't presume to meddle in romantic relationships. What governments are equipped to do is address poverty head on, by acknowledging and supporting people's economic and social rights. Social policies such as paid parental leave, universal child care, and universal health care would go a long way to alleviate the financial pressures that unmarried moms face. This kind of government intervention is why a single mother and her child in Denmark are no more likely to be poor than a married mother and her child. 18 But the complex story of family formation and black mothering isn't only about beating back stigma and correcting falsehoods; the psychic and emotional impact of leading households on our own is often ignored. I've been guilty of this myself. In writing about black women and marriage in the past, I've failed to acknowledge that some of us actually aspire to the narratives of being chosen, of living happily ever after. Yes, it's important that we can and do successfully raise children without steady, committed romantic partners. But can we also note how depressing it is that we so often have to? There's a reason some black women were excited when finally, after 12 seasons of the franchise, there was a black Bachelorette . Some of us want love, marriage, and a baby carriage in exactly that order, and preferably with black men. It's important to acknowledge how it feels when those desires are often out of reach for us in a way they're just not for other women. 19 Poverty's true causes: Lost in the conversation about single parenthood and poverty is the impact of low-wage work on black families. No wonder so many Fight for $15 leaders are black women. Add to the existential angst the day-to-day responsibility of being in charge. Even with family help and enough money to pay for childcare, it's exhausting to be the sole adult responsible for cooking, bathing, reading, playing, and cleaning on those days or in those stretches of hours when you're going it alone. I never take it for granted that I was 100 percent certain I wanted to be a mother when I had my daughter. I can't imagine giving mothering the energy it demands and deserves if I had come into this reluctantly, especially now that it's often just the two of us. I enjoy the work of mothering and don't often feel like I'm going through the motions or putting on a brave face, but there have been times when my spirit has flagged under the weight. I'm reminded of those times, the moments I've blinked back tears, when I read asha bandele's memoir, Something Like Beautiful , about raising her daughter while her husband was incarcerated and then deported. She writes: \"I told myself if I cried I was setting a bad example for my daughter. Others told me the very same thing. Told me never to be a victim, Black women are not victims and we are not weak.... In the post-welfare-reform days of the alpha mom, I was clear that being a victim, showing any weakness, was punishable by complete isolation and total loss of respect. I was a mother, a single mother, a single Black mother. I was part of a tradition of women who do not bend and who do not break. This is what I said, this is how I now defined myself. As someone with no room for error.\" 20 I see little room for error in my own life. I have to guard against letting parenting become one more place I practice perfectionism. There are so many reasons to try to do it as close to perfectly as possible, since the mainstream conversation tells me that as both an unmarried mom and the child of an unmarried mom, I'm incapable of being or raising a successful, well-adjusted person. Even though I have known since childhood how mean-spirited and hollow that conversation is, I'm still affected by the stigma. As I get older, I can also see the danger in being too defensive, in disproving others' assumptions before I honestly explore my own nuanced truths. In 2007, artist Meshell Ndegeocello released an album called The World Has Made Me the Man of My Dreams . That album's title reminds me that learning to navigate an often-inhospitable world on one's own and with the help of relatives and friends can make us into our own rock-solid protectors. Partnership with a man can begin to feel unnecessary: nice when it comes along, but not a must for survival or happiness. This strength can be a source of pride, but it can also be reason to grieve when one starts to think about all the structural and historical reasons that black women have had to be so independent, and black men have often been unavailable or unwilling to offer meaningful help. 21 It's a February day, and Is and I are at the playground.

My child is a watcher; she's super-nosy and could be thinking anything. She actually gets playground time with her dad, though not daily. But my mind goes there because I am still, at 39, processing my own feelings around abandonment and loss. I don't want that for my daughter. I don't want her to know that sense of longing. If she does, I want her to know that she can express it, put it out in the open. In my experience, the silence around an absence can do more harm than the absence itself.

It's important to acknowledge how it feels when those desires are often out of reach for us in a way they're just not for other women. 19 Poverty's true causes: Lost in the conversation about single parenthood and poverty is the impact of low-wage work on black families. No wonder so many Fight for $15 leaders are black women. Add to the existential angst the day-to-day responsibility of being in charge. Even with family help and enough money to pay for childcare, it's exhausting to be the sole adult responsible for cooking, bathing, reading, playing, and cleaning on those days or in those stretches of hours when you're going it alone. I never take it for granted that I was 100 percent certain I wanted to be a mother when I had my daughter. I can't imagine giving mothering the energy it demands and deserves if I had come into this reluctantly, especially now that it's often just the two of us. I enjoy the work of mothering and don't often feel like I'm going through the motions or putting on a brave face, but there have been times when my spirit has flagged under the weight. I'm reminded of those times, the moments I've blinked back tears, when I read asha bandele's memoir, Something Like Beautiful , about raising her daughter while her husband was incarcerated and then deported. She writes: \"I told myself if I cried I was setting a bad example for my daughter. Others told me the very same thing. Told me never to be a victim, Black women are not victims and we are not weak.... In the post-welfare-reform days of the alpha mom, I was clear that being a victim, showing any weakness, was punishable by complete isolation and total loss of respect. I was a mother, a single mother, a single Black mother. I was part of a tradition of women who do not bend and who do not break. This is what I said, this is how I now defined myself. As someone with no room for error.\" 20 I see little room for error in my own life. I have to guard against letting parenting become one more place I practice perfectionism. There are so many reasons to try to do it as close to perfectly as possible, since the mainstream conversation tells me that as both an unmarried mom and the child of an unmarried mom, I'm incapable of being or raising a successful, well-adjusted person. Even though I have known since childhood how mean-spirited and hollow that conversation is, I'm still affected by the stigma. As I get older, I can also see the danger in being too defensive, in disproving others' assumptions before I honestly explore my own nuanced truths. In 2007, artist Meshell Ndegeocello released an album called The World Has Made Me the Man of My Dreams . That album's title reminds me that learning to navigate an often-inhospitable world on one's own and with the help of relatives and friends can make us into our own rock-solid protectors. Partnership with a man can begin to feel unnecessary: nice when it comes along, but not a must for survival or happiness. This strength can be a source of pride, but it can also be reason to grieve when one starts to think about all the structural and historical reasons that black women have had to be so independent, and black men have often been unavailable or unwilling to offer meaningful help. 21 It's a February day, and Is and I are at the playground. I push her on the swing and notice that she can't take her eyes off the next swing over, where a dad is pushing his daughter. I think to myself: I know that feeling. That \"Why don't I have that?\" feeling. That \"Where's my dad?\" feeling. That \"I want bigger, messier, gruffer, rougher, and sillier than Mom\" feeling. But the truth is that I'm projecting. My child is a watcher; she's super-nosy and could be thinking anything. She actually gets playground time with her dad, though not daily. But my mind goes there because I am still, at 39, processing my own feelings around abandonment and loss. I don't want that for my daughter. I don't want her to know that sense of longing. If she does, I want her to know that she can express it, put it out in the open. In my experience, the silence around an absence can do more harm than the absence itself. For Is and for me, the challenge is to find-to make-space where we can be vulnerable and acknowledge hurt without giving into the narrative that we are of and in a \"broken family.\" As we are, our family is perfectly whole. 22\n\nBut the complex story of family formation and black mothering isn't only about beating back stigma and correcting falsehoods; the psychic and emotional impact of leading households on our own is often ignored. I've been guilty of this myself. In writing about black women and marriage in the past, I've failed to acknowledge that some of us actually aspire to the narratives of being chosen, of living happily ever after. Yes, it's important that we can and do successfully raise children without steady, committed romantic partners. But can we also note how depressing it is that we so often have to?

Host and founder Don Cornelius's adage of \"Love, Peace, and Soul\" resonated for generations, unleashing what Nelson George has called the civil rights movement's secret power: \"Black Joy.\" Yet embedded within the funky rhythms, ethereal harmonies, and Day-Glo body suits was a desire for something more elusive: Black Power. Black music was a potent force in the drive towards civil rights, from the activists that repurposed spirituals and labor songs into protest anthems to groups like Curtis Mayfield and the Impressions urging folk to \"keep on pushing',\" Aretha Franklin demanding \"Respect,\" and James Brown saying it loud about being \"Black and Proud.\" The year of 1971 was a coming out of sorts for politically charged messages in Black music, with Aretha Franklin's Live at Fillmore West , Sly & the Family Stone's There's a Riot Goin' On , and Marvin Gaye's What's Going On all making their debuts. The national broadcast of Soul Train was born in and of this moment. A local version of Soul Train had already launched in August of 1970 in Chicago on WCIU-TV, with sponsorship from the Sears and Roebuck Company. The broadcast featured legendary Chicago vocalist Jerry Butler, as well as Chicago-based groups the Five Stairsteps, riding the waves of their breakthrough hit \"Ooh Child,\" and the Chi-Lites, whose own mainstream breakthrough, \"Have You Seen Her,\" would be a year away. Fellow Chicagoans Syl Johnson (\"Is It Because I'm Black\") and Gene Chandler of \"Duke of Earl\" fame were among the acts who would appear on the program's second episode. This ability to draw on \"local\" talent and the value of the show as a platform for up-and-coming acts would be important to Soul Train 's success. Eventually, an appearance on Soul Train would provide a kind of street cred for Black artists-even those who had achieved national crossover success. Soul Train hit nationally syndicated airwaves in late October of 1971. The first show featured the Honey Cone (\"Want Ads\"), Eddie Kendricks, newly solo after a decade as the co-lead of The Temptations, and Gladys Knight and the Pips. But it was the energy of the teenagers who populated the soundstage introducing the nation to the Get Down, the Hi-Low, and the Breakdown that made the show an immediate hit. In her book Love, Peace and Soul: Behind the Scenes of America's Favorite Dance Show Soul Train , Ericka Blount Danois described it as \"black radio on television.\" More to the point, Soul Train was an electronically mediated version of the chitlin' circuit -the informal networks of theaters, night-clubs, and after-hours joints that sustained Black performers who were denied access to integrated venues prior to the civil rights movement. One of the linchpins of the Black entrepreneurial class, the chitlin' circuit was the closest thing to a national Black culture.

One of the company's ads from that period featured Frederick Douglass chiding a Black teen for his messed-up Afro. Johnson Products was one of the first Black-owned businesses to trade on the American stock exchange, and, as Blount Danois observes, \" Soul Train was able to continue its programming with a level of autonomy that would not have been possible if it had had to rely on a national sponsor that had to cater to Southern affiliates.\" Company cofounder George E. Johnson was emblematic of a generation of so-called self-made Black men that Cornelius took cues from: Berry Gordy at Motown Records, John H. Johnson of Johnson Publishing, Al Bell at Stax Records, and James Brown, the \"hardest-working man\" in show business. These were not men who would necessarily raise a Black Power fist or quote Stokely Carmichael or Angela Davis, but were activists nonetheless, who doubled down on the ideas of Black respectability and Black excellence as counters to the racial stereotypes that circulated widely in American media and popular culture. Cornielius himself was hypersensitive to negative racial stereotypes; in the program's popular word-scramble segment, he wanted to make sure participants actually knew how to spell-even sharing the word beforehand-to guarantee that they wouldn't show up on national television reinforcing ideas of Black illiteracy. Part of Cornelius's success lay in his valuation of Black culture as something desirable to mass audiences-and his devout belief that Black culture should be in the hands of Black people . This valuation wasn't new: Ahmet Ertegun and Leonard and Marshall Chess built musical empires at Atlantic and Chess Records, respectively, largely on the promotion of Black blues and rhythm & blues artists. Current Issue View our current issue Accordingly Soul Train 's breakthrough success soon caught the attention of Dick Clark, the man behind the hugely popular dance show American Bandstand . American Bandstand set the industry standard for teen-based dance programs, and though Clark's platform was important for emerging soul artists in the 1960s to reach white audiences, even Clark knew he couldn't compete with Soul Train . When Cornelius rebuffed Clark's efforts to buy Soul Train , the latter responded with an ill-advised attempt to create his own version: Soul Unlimited . The show lasted only a year, in large part because of a behind-the-scenes campaign, led by music industry pioneer Clarence Avant-aka the \"Black Godfather\"-and the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Whether Soul Unlimited could deliver a product that could compete with Soul Train was beside the point, and apparently beyond Clark's grasp. What resonated for Black viewers were vibrant and authentic expressions of Black culture that were produced for and by Black people. According to Nelson George in his book The Hippest Trip in America: Soul Train and the Evolution of Culture & Style , \"Many in the black community felt that having a black-owned show on television wasn't just cool TV, but an extension of the Civil Rights Movement. The idea that Clark, with whom blacks had always had an uneasy relationship, could kill Soul Train led to threats of an ABC boycott.\" Cornelius viewed Soul Train as a recognizable Black-owned brand that would transcend changing taste and time. But with the advent of music video programs like BET's Video Soul or Ralph McDaniels's independently produced Video Music Box -a show that was largely indebted to the spirit of Soul Train -challenging his show's singular role, Cornelius launched The Soul Train Awards in 1987. As music industry recognition lagged for R&B and rap in the 1980s, Cornelius offered the gravitas of the Soul Train brand to affirm what mattered to his core audience. The show became a litmus test for what young Black audiences valued-and what they didn't, as when Whitney Houston was famously booed during the awards show. Snoop Dogg perhaps best described the enduring power of Soul Train in 1994 when-holding up his Soul Train Award- he quipped on stage , \"I ain't mad I 'cause didn't win no Grammy.... This the Black folk's Grammy.\" Soul Train survived until 2006, though Cornelius relinquished the hosting reins in the early 1990s. When Soul Train finally derailed after 35 years, it did so as the longest first-run syndicated series in American television history-until it was surpassed by Entertainment Tonight in 2016. Nearly 50 years after the local version was launched in Chicago, a new generation was drawn to the series American Soul -a loosely based account of the rise of Cornelius and Soul Train featuring many contemporary artists who leapt at the opportunity to portray iconic figures, like Kelly Rowland appearing as Gladys Knight and Bobby Brown as Rufus Thomas. In an article by the late journalist Greg Tate in 1994, Cornelius suggested that Black culture was \"one of the few things as an American of African descent that you can depend on. It's one of the few things that you can call yours.\" For Black Americans, Cornelius made sure we could always call Soul Train ours.\n\nBlack music was a potent force in the drive towards civil rights, from the activists that repurposed spirituals and labor songs into protest anthems to groups like Curtis Mayfield and the Impressions urging folk to \"keep on pushing',\" Aretha Franklin demanding \"Respect,\" and James Brown saying it loud about being \"Black and Proud.\" The year of 1971 was a coming out of sorts for politically charged messages in Black music, with Aretha Franklin's Live at Fillmore West , Sly & the Family Stone's There's a Riot Goin' On , and Marvin Gaye's What's Going On all making their debuts.

Johnson Products was one of the first Black-owned businesses to trade on the American stock exchange, and, as Blount Danois observes, \" Soul Train was able to continue its programming with a level of autonomy that would not have been possible if it had had to rely on a national sponsor that had to cater to Southern affiliates.\" Company cofounder George E. Johnson was emblematic of a generation of so-called self-made Black men that Cornelius took cues from: Berry Gordy at Motown Records, John H. Johnson of Johnson Publishing, Al Bell at Stax Records, and James Brown, the \"hardest-working man\" in show business. These were not men who would necessarily raise a Black Power fist or quote Stokely Carmichael or Angela Davis, but were activists nonetheless, who doubled down on the ideas of Black respectability and Black excellence as counters to the racial stereotypes that circulated widely in American media and popular culture.

Current Issue View our current issue Accordingly Soul Train 's breakthrough success soon caught the attention of Dick Clark, the man behind the hugely popular dance show American Bandstand . American Bandstand set the industry standard for teen-based dance programs, and though Clark's platform was important for emerging soul artists in the 1960s to reach white audiences, even Clark knew he couldn't compete with Soul Train . When Cornelius rebuffed Clark's efforts to buy Soul Train , the latter responded with an ill-advised attempt to create his own version: Soul Unlimited . The show lasted only a year, in large part because of a behind-the-scenes campaign, led by music industry pioneer Clarence Avant-aka the \"Black Godfather\"-and the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Whether Soul Unlimited could deliver a product that could compete with Soul Train was beside the point, and apparently beyond Clark's grasp. What resonated for Black viewers were vibrant and authentic expressions of Black culture that were produced for and by Black people. According to Nelson George in his book The Hippest Trip in America: Soul Train and the Evolution of Culture & Style , \"Many in the black community felt that having a black-owned show on television wasn't just cool TV, but an extension of the Civil Rights Movement. The idea that Clark, with whom blacks had always had an uneasy relationship, could kill Soul Train led to threats of an ABC boycott.\" Cornelius viewed Soul Train as a recognizable Black-owned brand that would transcend changing taste and time. But with the advent of music video programs like BET's Video Soul or Ralph McDaniels's independently produced Video Music Box -a show that was largely indebted to the spirit of Soul Train -challenging his show's singular role, Cornelius launched The Soul Train Awards in 1987. As music industry recognition lagged for R&B and rap in the 1980s, Cornelius offered the gravitas of the Soul Train brand to affirm what mattered to his core audience. The show became a litmus test for what young Black audiences valued-and what they didn't, as when Whitney Houston was famously booed during the awards show. Snoop Dogg perhaps best described the enduring power of Soul Train in 1994 when-holding up his Soul Train Award- he quipped on stage , \"I ain't mad I 'cause didn't win no Grammy.... This the Black folk's Grammy.\" Soul Train survived until 2006, though Cornelius relinquished the hosting reins in the early 1990s. When Soul Train finally derailed after 35 years, it did so as the longest first-run syndicated series in American television history-until it was surpassed by Entertainment Tonight in 2016. Nearly 50 years after the local version was launched in Chicago, a new generation was drawn to the series American Soul -a loosely based account of the rise of Cornelius and Soul Train featuring many contemporary artists who leapt at the opportunity to portray iconic figures, like Kelly Rowland appearing as Gladys Knight and Bobby Brown as Rufus Thomas. In an article by the late journalist Greg Tate in 1994, Cornelius suggested that Black culture was \"one of the few things as an American of African descent that you can depend on. It's one of the few things that you can call yours.\" For Black Americans, Cornelius made sure we could always call Soul Train ours.\n\nA local version of Soul Train had already launched in August of 1970 in Chicago on WCIU-TV, with sponsorship from the Sears and Roebuck Company. The broadcast featured legendary Chicago vocalist Jerry Butler, as well as Chicago-based groups the Five Stairsteps, riding the waves of their breakthrough hit \"Ooh Child,\" and the Chi-Lites, whose own mainstream breakthrough, \"Have You Seen Her,\" would be a year away. Fellow Chicagoans Syl Johnson (\"Is It Because I'm Black\") and Gene Chandler of \"Duke of Earl\" fame were among the acts who would appear on the program's second episode. This ability to draw on \"local\" talent and the value of the show as a platform for up-and-coming acts would be important to Soul Train 's success. Eventually, an appearance on Soul Train would provide a kind of street cred for Black artists-even those who had achieved national crossover success. Soul Train hit nationally syndicated airwaves in late October of 1971. The first show featured the Honey Cone (\"Want Ads\"), Eddie Kendricks, newly solo after a decade as the co-lead of The Temptations, and Gladys Knight and the Pips. But it was the energy of the teenagers who populated the soundstage introducing the nation to the Get Down, the Hi-Low, and the Breakdown that made the show an immediate hit. In her book Love, Peace and Soul: Behind the Scenes of America's Favorite Dance Show Soul Train , Ericka Blount Danois described it as \"black radio on television.\" More to the point, Soul Train was an electronically mediated version of the chitlin' circuit -the informal networks of theaters, night-clubs, and after-hours joints that sustained Black performers who were denied access to integrated venues prior to the civil rights movement. One of the linchpins of the Black entrepreneurial class, the chitlin' circuit was the closest thing to a national Black culture.

Nearly 50 years after the local version was launched in Chicago, a new generation was drawn to the series American Soul -a loosely based account of the rise of Cornelius and Soul Train featuring many contemporary artists who leapt at the opportunity to portray iconic figures, like Kelly Rowland appearing as Gladys Knight and Bobby Brown as Rufus Thomas. In an article by the late journalist Greg Tate in 1994, Cornelius suggested that Black culture was \"one of the few things as an American of African descent that you can depend on. It's one of the few things that you can call yours.\" For Black Americans, Cornelius made sure we could always call Soul Train ours.\n\nAccordingly Soul Train 's breakthrough success soon caught the attention of Dick Clark, the man behind the hugely popular dance show American Bandstand . American Bandstand set the industry standard for teen-based dance programs, and though Clark's platform was important for emerging soul artists in the 1960s to reach white audiences, even Clark knew he couldn't compete with Soul Train . When Cornelius rebuffed Clark's efforts to buy Soul Train , the latter responded with an ill-advised attempt to create his own version: Soul Unlimited . The show lasted only a year, in large part because of a behind-the-scenes campaign, led by music industry pioneer Clarence Avant-aka the \"Black Godfather\"-and the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Whether Soul Unlimited could deliver a product that could compete with Soul Train was beside the point, and apparently beyond Clark's grasp. What resonated for Black viewers were vibrant and authentic expressions of Black culture that were produced for and by Black people. According to Nelson George in his book The Hippest Trip in America: Soul Train and the Evolution of Culture & Style , \"Many in the black community felt that having a black-owned show on television wasn't just cool TV, but an extension of the Civil Rights Movement. The idea that Clark, with whom blacks had always had an uneasy relationship, could kill Soul Train led to threats of an ABC boycott.\" Cornelius viewed Soul Train as a recognizable Black-owned brand that would transcend changing taste and time. But with the advent of music video programs like BET's Video Soul or Ralph McDaniels's independently produced Video Music Box -a show that was largely indebted to the spirit of Soul Train -challenging his show's singular role, Cornelius launched The Soul Train Awards in 1987. As music industry recognition lagged for R&B and rap in the 1980s, Cornelius offered the gravitas of the Soul Train brand to affirm what mattered to his core audience. The show became a litmus test for what young Black audiences valued-and what they didn't, as when Whitney Houston was famously booed during the awards show. Snoop Dogg perhaps best described the enduring power of Soul Train in 1994 when-holding up his Soul Train Award- he quipped on stage , \"I ain't mad I 'cause didn't win no Grammy.... This the Black folk's Grammy.\" Soul Train survived until 2006, though Cornelius relinquished the hosting reins in the early 1990s.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Heads in cars flip all the way around. Workers in shop windows stop what they're doing to look at me blank faced-as if I'm not their daughter's classmate, their friend's co-worker, like they haven't known me my whole life. \"When I forget the spectacle of myself,\" Diamond wryly notes, \"I look behind me to see who is the me.\" Books in review Swift River By Essie Chambers Buy this book Diamond is 16, biracial, overweight and seemingly in the midst of outgrowing everything familiar-her body, stretch-marked with the weight of racial trauma; her relationship with her loving but grief-numbed mother, Anna; and perhaps most of all, her down-at-the-heels, otherwise all-white hometown, where Diamond's size, skin, and story mark her as a permanent outsider. It is the summer of 1987, seven years after her African American father abruptly and mysteriously vanished, and with him, Diamond's only connection to an extended family whose Blackness reflects her own. Like the figure of \"Pop,\" Blackness is like a specter in Diamond's life, intangible yet omnipresent in its echoing and mystifying absence. More From Kali Holloway The Democrats' Lost Millions April 10, 2025 Why Musk and Trump Really Want to Gut the Government April 1, 2025 White Flops Rejoice! March 12, 2025 Swift River is \"a story about leaving,\" Diamond indicates from the novel's outset, and her desire to get out is indicated by bedroom walls adorned not with images of pop stars or 1980s teen idols, but aspirational destination photos: the pyramids, California's redwood coast, Stonehenge. There are also driving lessons, kept secret from her mother, whose unaddressed mourning manifests as codependency with her daughter. Despite, or perhaps because of, all she has endured, Diamond possesses emotional insights beyond her years-and a wit sharpened by the coarseness of fatphobic insults and racial slights. In one scene, she discovers the word \" NIGER \" has been scrawled next to her family's listing in a public phonebook. Grabbing a pen from her purse, she quickly, cheekily adds a final bit: \"- The third longest river in Africa! \" At its heart, Swift River is about the shedding of secrets-personal, familial, and communal-and concealed truths that Diamond learns have resulted in a transgenerational sense of placelessness, stagnation, and loss. That process begins when Diamond unexpectedly receives a letter from Auntie Lena, a previously unknown paternal relative. Thus begins an exchange that unearths the hidden history of Swift River's once-thriving Black community, a population driven from the town's borders by racist Jim Crow violence, upending Diamond's Black family tree at the roots. In that history, she finds not just a kindredness with bygone ancestors but also the familial legacy that blossomed from so many fractured branches. It's both recognition and reckoning, helping Diamond to locate herself in her past, make sense of her identity in the present, and map the route that lays out her future.

Diamond's family narrative is inextricably tangled in a larger history of race and place in America. The expulsion of entire Black communities from towns like Swift River was not uncommon during the Jim Crow era, a period marked by anti-Black pogroms and white vigilante violence. Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Rosewood, Florida, were all-Black towns leveled by white terror violence, finally acknowledged only in recent years, but there were many more . Equally common were towns like Swift River-all-white \"sundown towns\" where Black people were banned after dark , and faced potentially lethal consequences if they lingered after sunset. According to James Loewen, author of Sundown Towns: A Hidden Dimension of American Racism , some 10,000 sundown towns existed in America well into the 1960s. Chambers says that upon beginning research for Swift River several years ago, she discovered a little-known geographic aspect of sundown towns. Current Issue View our current issue \"I thought I understood what sundown towns were. I had read about them. We've all seen them represented in movies, we know the role the Green Book played because of sundown towns,\" Chambers told me. \"But what I didn't understand, that [Loewen's] book helped me to realize, is that sundown towns were primarily a northern thing-North meaning Midwest and West as well-and formed part of the response to the Great Migration. That's when I started to think about what it would mean for the book if Swift River were a former sundown town.\" Author Essie Chambers, it cannot be stated enough, is not Diamond Newberry; likewise, Swift River is not an autobiography. (Authors of color who write characters of color are all too often assumed to be unimaginatively recounting their own lives.) But like Diamond, Chambers is biracial (Black-identifying), and grew up in a small New England town where she, her siblings, and her father were among the few residents of color. There are as many Black American family stories as there are Black American families, and the details differ in critical ways. But for most Americans of color, there is relatability and resonance in stories of navigating inhospitable white spaces, just as there is in the experience of being the only one . \"When you have to maintain your sense of self, when you have to understand your identity in the absence of Black culture-that, too, is a part of the Black American experience,\" Chambers told me. \"And I've now experienced it in so many different contexts. There's the experience of being born into that situation, and that has its own set of rules. There's the corporate experience of it, where you are often folding yourself in half.\" Those insults can hollow out and diminish, but just as frequently, they can also accrue and amass within us. Chambers noted to me that Diamond's weight, in part, results from having to swallow so many racial microaggressions without response. Most painfully, for Diamond, those come from friends, family members and loved ones whose words inadvertently reveal their own unexamined anti-Blackness. In Swift River , Diamond's white maternal grandmother fails to notice that a tchotchke she brings home is a racist caricature; Diamond's one friend, while earnestly trying to protect her from a bigoted stranger hurling racist slurs at her, offers up a tokenizing defense, telling the stranger that Diamond is \"not like that.\" Chambers says her deftness in depicting those quotidian brushes with anti-Black racism were influenced by Claudia Rankine's book of poetry about encounters with anti-Black racism Citizen: An American Lyric. \"There was something about the way that [Rankine] expressed microaggressions, which was that she showed they so often came from people she loved. I hadn't been thinking about it that way, and that shifted my thinking,\" Chambers told me. \" Swift River wouldn't work if all the white characters were just cartoonishly bad. That wasn't my experience when I was growing up. Yes, maybe if I went for a walk, someone might scream something ugly out of a window. But that wasn't the daily experience of being there. It was much more about having to stay in your body somehow-in your skin-as people you cared about-teachers and friends-said hurtful things, maybe without even understanding that they were hurtful, just to be able to survive that environment and feel like a part of it.\" And perhaps to feel, however fleetingly or superficially, safe. Swift River is the only home Diamond has ever had. Known dangers can seem less threatening than unknown dangers. Diamond's resolve to leave Swift River flags during the moments when she thinks, \" These are my people in so many ways,\" as Chambers puts it. \"At least, until she finds new people.\" In the slowly deteriorating familial home Diamond shares with her Irish American mother, there is a bounty of family heirlooms: \"feathery yellowed papers announcing ancient births and deaths and marriages, antique wedding chests, lacy baptism dresses,\" allowing Diamond to feel like she's \"frolicking with the ancestors.\" Contrast her mother's tangible family tree roots with the rootlessness of her gardening-obsessed father, who to Diamond seems \"as if he sprang from the ground like one of his plants.\" \"I've always felt the gaps in my family tree,\" Chambers, who can trace her mother's side to an ancient King of Scotland, says. \"Especially because I've had these riches on my mother's side, I saw how they helped form her identity and her sense of herself.\" This is a typical African American conundrum, the result of a lack of documentation from the dislocating force of slavery, and a disregard for the humanity and personhood of Black enslaved peoples. But in writing Swift River and as a producer on the highly decorated 2022 film Descendant -director Margaret Brown's documentary about the last known ship to traffick African people into enslavement in the United States, and the living descendants of those onboard-Chambers learned how legacies are passed in so many other ways. \"Someone asked me recently how I learned storytelling, and I realized a lot of it was from watching my father and his brothers tell family stories on the porch,\" Chambers told me. \"That was the thing I learned working on Descendant . Oral history is not a lesser history, especially for people who are not part of the dominant culture. It's essential to tell the stories and pass them down in that way. And so I was part of many of those moments-the passing down of history, without even understanding that was happening. So in that way, I have a very different understanding of history on my dad's side. But it's one that is also very rich.\"\n\nIf I'm on foot, people stare so hard it's like I'm on fire.

March 12, 2025 Swift River is \"a story about leaving,\" Diamond indicates from the novel's outset, and her desire to get out is indicated by bedroom walls adorned not with images of pop stars or 1980s teen idols, but aspirational destination photos: the pyramids, California's redwood coast, Stonehenge. There are also driving lessons, kept secret from her mother, whose unaddressed mourning manifests as codependency with her daughter. Despite, or perhaps because of, all she has endured, Diamond possesses emotional insights beyond her years-and a wit sharpened by the coarseness of fatphobic insults and racial slights. In one scene, she discovers the word \" NIGER \" has been scrawled next to her family's listing in a public phonebook. Grabbing a pen from her purse, she quickly, cheekily adds a final bit: \"- The third longest river in Africa! \" At its heart, Swift River is about the shedding of secrets-personal, familial, and communal-and concealed truths that Diamond learns have resulted in a transgenerational sense of placelessness, stagnation, and loss. That process begins when Diamond unexpectedly receives a letter from Auntie Lena, a previously unknown paternal relative. Thus begins an exchange that unearths the hidden history of Swift River's once-thriving Black community, a population driven from the town's borders by racist Jim Crow violence, upending Diamond's Black family tree at the roots. In that history, she finds not just a kindredness with bygone ancestors but also the familial legacy that blossomed from so many fractured branches. It's both recognition and reckoning, helping Diamond to locate herself in her past, make sense of her identity in the present, and map the route that lays out her future.

Diamond's family narrative is inextricably tangled in a larger history of race and place in America. The expulsion of entire Black communities from towns like Swift River was not uncommon during the Jim Crow era, a period marked by anti-Black pogroms and white vigilante violence. Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Rosewood, Florida, were all-Black towns leveled by white terror violence, finally acknowledged only in recent years, but there were many more . Equally common were towns like Swift River-all-white \"sundown towns\" where Black people were banned after dark , and faced potentially lethal consequences if they lingered after sunset. According to James Loewen, author of Sundown Towns: A Hidden Dimension of American Racism , some 10,000 sundown towns existed in America well into the 1960s. Chambers says that upon beginning research for Swift River several years ago, she discovered a little-known geographic aspect of sundown towns. Current Issue View our current issue \"I thought I understood what sundown towns were. I had read about them. We've all seen them represented in movies, we know the role the Green Book played because of sundown towns,\" Chambers told me. \"But what I didn't understand, that [Loewen's] book helped me to realize, is that sundown towns were primarily a northern thing-North meaning Midwest and West as well-and formed part of the response to the Great Migration. That's when I started to think about what it would mean for the book if Swift River were a former sundown town.\" Author Essie Chambers, it cannot be stated enough, is not Diamond Newberry; likewise, Swift River is not an autobiography. (Authors of color who write characters of color are all too often assumed to be unimaginatively recounting their own lives.) But like Diamond, Chambers is biracial (Black-identifying), and grew up in a small New England town where she, her siblings, and her father were among the few residents of color. There are as many Black American family stories as there are Black American families, and the details differ in critical ways. But for most Americans of color, there is relatability and resonance in stories of navigating inhospitable white spaces, just as there is in the experience of being the only one . \"When you have to maintain your sense of self, when you have to understand your identity in the absence of Black culture-that, too, is a part of the Black American experience,\" Chambers told me. \"And I've now experienced it in so many different contexts. There's the experience of being born into that situation, and that has its own set of rules. There's the corporate experience of it, where you are often folding yourself in half.\" Those insults can hollow out and diminish, but just as frequently, they can also accrue and amass within us. Chambers noted to me that Diamond's weight, in part, results from having to swallow so many racial microaggressions without response. Most painfully, for Diamond, those come from friends, family members and loved ones whose words inadvertently reveal their own unexamined anti-Blackness. In Swift River , Diamond's white maternal grandmother fails to notice that a tchotchke she brings home is a racist caricature; Diamond's one friend, while earnestly trying to protect her from a bigoted stranger hurling racist slurs at her, offers up a tokenizing defense, telling the stranger that Diamond is \"not like that.\" Chambers says her deftness in depicting those quotidian brushes with anti-Black racism were influenced by Claudia Rankine's book of poetry about encounters with anti-Black racism Citizen: An American Lyric. \"There was something about the way that [Rankine] expressed microaggressions, which was that she showed they so often came from people she loved. I hadn't been thinking about it that way, and that shifted my thinking,\" Chambers told me. \" Swift River wouldn't work if all the white characters were just cartoonishly bad. That wasn't my experience when I was growing up. Yes, maybe if I went for a walk, someone might scream something ugly out of a window. But that wasn't the daily experience of being there. It was much more about having to stay in your body somehow-in your skin-as people you cared about-teachers and friends-said hurtful things, maybe without even understanding that they were hurtful, just to be able to survive that environment and feel like a part of it.\" And perhaps to feel, however fleetingly or superficially, safe. Swift River is the only home Diamond has ever had. Known dangers can seem less threatening than unknown dangers. Diamond's resolve to leave Swift River flags during the moments when she thinks, \" These are my people in so many ways,\" as Chambers puts it. \"At least, until she finds new people.\" In the slowly deteriorating familial home Diamond shares with her Irish American mother, there is a bounty of family heirlooms: \"feathery yellowed papers announcing ancient births and deaths and marriages, antique wedding chests, lacy baptism dresses,\" allowing Diamond to feel like she's \"frolicking with the ancestors.\" Contrast her mother's tangible family tree roots with the rootlessness of her gardening-obsessed father, who to Diamond seems \"as if he sprang from the ground like one of his plants.\" \"I've always felt the gaps in my family tree,\" Chambers, who can trace her mother's side to an ancient King of Scotland, says. \"Especially because I've had these riches on my mother's side, I saw how they helped form her identity and her sense of herself.\" This is a typical African American conundrum, the result of a lack of documentation from the dislocating force of slavery, and a disregard for the humanity and personhood of Black enslaved peoples. But in writing Swift River and as a producer on the highly decorated 2022 film Descendant -director Margaret Brown's documentary about the last known ship to traffick African people into enslavement in the United States, and the living descendants of those onboard-Chambers learned how legacies are passed in so many other ways. \"Someone asked me recently how I learned storytelling, and I realized a lot of it was from watching my father and his brothers tell family stories on the porch,\" Chambers told me. \"That was the thing I learned working on Descendant .

There's the experience of being born into that situation, and that has its own set of rules. There's the corporate experience of it, where you are often folding yourself in half.\" Those insults can hollow out and diminish, but just as frequently, they can also accrue and amass within us. Chambers noted to me that Diamond's weight, in part, results from having to swallow so many racial microaggressions without response. Most painfully, for Diamond, those come from friends, family members and loved ones whose words inadvertently reveal their own unexamined anti-Blackness. In Swift River , Diamond's white maternal grandmother fails to notice that a tchotchke she brings home is a racist caricature; Diamond's one friend, while earnestly trying to protect her from a bigoted stranger hurling racist slurs at her, offers up a tokenizing defense, telling the stranger that Diamond is \"not like that.\" Chambers says her deftness in depicting those quotidian brushes with anti-Black racism were influenced by Claudia Rankine's book of poetry about encounters with anti-Black racism Citizen: An American Lyric. \"There was something about the way that [Rankine] expressed microaggressions, which was that she showed they so often came from people she loved. I hadn't been thinking about it that way, and that shifted my thinking,\" Chambers told me. \" Swift River wouldn't work if all the white characters were just cartoonishly bad. That wasn't my experience when I was growing up. Yes, maybe if I went for a walk, someone might scream something ugly out of a window. But that wasn't the daily experience of being there. It was much more about having to stay in your body somehow-in your skin-as people you cared about-teachers and friends-said hurtful things, maybe without even understanding that they were hurtful, just to be able to survive that environment and feel like a part of it.\" And perhaps to feel, however fleetingly or superficially, safe. Swift River is the only home Diamond has ever had. Known dangers can seem less threatening than unknown dangers. Diamond's resolve to leave Swift River flags during the moments when she thinks, \" These are my people in so many ways,\" as Chambers puts it. \"At least, until she finds new people.\" In the slowly deteriorating familial home Diamond shares with her Irish American mother, there is a bounty of family heirlooms: \"feathery yellowed papers announcing ancient births and deaths and marriages, antique wedding chests, lacy baptism dresses,\" allowing Diamond to feel like she's \"frolicking with the ancestors.\" Contrast her mother's tangible family tree roots with the rootlessness of her gardening-obsessed father, who to Diamond seems \"as if he sprang from the ground like one of his plants.\" \"I've always felt the gaps in my family tree,\" Chambers, who can trace her mother's side to an ancient King of Scotland, says. \"Especially because I've had these riches on my mother's side, I saw how they helped form her identity and her sense of herself.\" This is a typical African American conundrum, the result of a lack of documentation from the dislocating force of slavery, and a disregard for the humanity and personhood of Black enslaved peoples. But in writing Swift River and as a producer on the highly decorated 2022 film Descendant -director Margaret Brown's documentary about the last known ship to traffick African people into enslavement in the United States, and the living descendants of those onboard-Chambers learned how legacies are passed in so many other ways. \"Someone asked me recently how I learned storytelling, and I realized a lot of it was from watching my father and his brothers tell family stories on the porch,\" Chambers told me. \"That was the thing I learned working on Descendant . Oral history is not a lesser history, especially for people who are not part of the dominant culture. It's essential to tell the stories and pass them down in that way. And so I was part of many of those moments-the passing down of history, without even understanding that was happening. So in that way, I have a very different understanding of history on my dad's side. But it's one that is also very rich.\"\n\nAuthor Essie Chambers, it cannot be stated enough, is not Diamond Newberry; likewise, Swift River is not an autobiography. (Authors of color who write characters of color are all too often assumed to be unimaginatively recounting their own lives.) But like Diamond, Chambers is biracial (Black-identifying), and grew up in a small New England town where she, her siblings, and her father were among the few residents of color. There are as many Black American family stories as there are Black American families, and the details differ in critical ways. But for most Americans of color, there is relatability and resonance in stories of navigating inhospitable white spaces, just as there is in the experience of being the only one . \"When you have to maintain your sense of self, when you have to understand your identity in the absence of Black culture-that, too, is a part of the Black American experience,\" Chambers told me. \"And I've now experienced it in so many different contexts.

And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

That's mostly because, as congenial as the two have been toward one another, I detect in Chait's argument one of my greatest pet peeves: a white person attempting to talk a black person down from their justifiable rage. One of the issues that has come up in this debate is the way these two men view American history. Chait writes: Coates and I disagree about racial progress in America. Coates sees the Americas' racial history as a story of continuity of white supremacy. I see the sequence (I'd call it a progression, but that term would load the argument in my favor) that began with chattel slavery and has led to the Obama administration as a story of halting, painful, non-continuous, but clear improvement. What a luxury it must be to define the history of racism in America through the lens of progress. He goes on: Coates associates himself with a quote from Malcolm X: \"You don't stick a knife in a man's back nine inches, and then pull it out six inches and say you're making progress.\" The analogy defines out of existence the very possibility of steady progress. People who subscribe to this way of thinking won't agree with measures that reduce but fail to eliminate racial discrimination, or those that reduce but fail to eliminate poverty, or reduce but fail to eliminate medical deprivation. I have written before , for instance, about how slavery continues to poison white minds in ways white people are often unaware of. One can believe in the continued existence of racism and still think that the scale of the evil has fallen enormously since the 19th century.

It's really that simple. You inevitably bring to that analysis an outsider's perspective, and from that vantage point, progress of any measure looks astounding. It's particularly awe-inspiring if it allows you to feel less implicated in the reason for that struggle. But that's what we call privilege: the ability to observe \"improvement\" because you're not experiencing the ever present oppression. It clouds your judgment. It deludes you into believing you have the authority of objectivity. It breeds self-righteousness. It impedes true progress. This doesn't preclude Chait, or other white people, from having an opinion on the state of racism in America. But it must be understood that their whiteness, and therefore distance from the lived experience of racism, affords them much rosier view of what constitutes progress. Chait previously wrote, with a note of disappointment, \"I have never previously detected this level of pessimism in Coates's thinking before.\" He isn't alone. Andrew Sullivan and quite a few of his readers detect a \"profound gloom\" in Coates's writing as of late, a change, they say, from just a few years ago. Where they see pessimism and gloom, I see anger, an anger I wish we saw more of. Anger helps build movements. Of course, anger alone isn't sufficient, but it has a galvanizing effect. There's an anger unique to experiencing America through blackness that has pushed this country to react. Chait, Sullivan and some anonymous emailers appear to want Coates to feel happier about the progress America has made in eliminating racism. Sure, there are still a few things left to hammer out, but c'mon, you've got to admit we've gotten better, right? Right? Here I find it instructive to revisit this passage from Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \"Letter from a Birmingham Jail\": We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed. Frankly, I have yet to engage in a direct action campaign that was \"well timed\" in the view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation. For years now I have heard the word \"Wait!\" It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This \"Wait\" has almost always meant \"Never.\" We must come to see, with one of our distinguished jurists, that \"justice too long delayed is justice denied.\" We have waited for more than 340 years for our constitutional and God given rights. The nations of Asia and Africa are moving with jetlike speed toward gaining political independence, but we still creep at horse and buggy pace toward gaining a cup of coffee at a lunch counter. Perhaps it is easy for those who have never felt the stinging darts of segregation to say, \"Wait.\" But when you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate filled policemen curse, kick and even kill your black brothers and sisters; when you see the vast majority of your twenty million Negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society; when you suddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to explain to your six year old daughter why she can't go to the public amusement park that has just been advertised on television, and see tears welling up in her eyes when she is told that Funtown is closed to colored children, and see ominous clouds of inferiority beginning to form in her little mental sky, and see her beginning to distort her personality by developing an unconscious bitterness toward white people; when you have to concoct an answer for a five year old son who is asking: \"Daddy, why do white people treat colored people so mean?\"; when you take a cross county drive and find it necessary to sleep night after night in the uncomfortable corners of your automobile because no motel will accept you; when you are humiliated day in and day out by nagging signs reading \"white\" and \"colored\"; when your first name becomes \"nigger,\" your middle name becomes \"boy\" (however old you are) and your last name becomes \"John,\" and your wife and mother are never given the respected title \"Mrs.\"; when you are harried by day and haunted by night by the fact that you are a Negro, living constantly at tiptoe stance, never quite knowing what to expect next, and are plagued with inner fears and outer resentments; when you are forever fighting a degenerating sense of \"nobodiness\"-then you will understand why we find it difficult to wait. There comes a time when the cup of endurance runs over, and men are no longer willing to be plunged into the abyss of despair. I hope, sirs, you can understand our legitimate and unavoidable impatience. That is an impatience born of rage. We don't associate King with anger, as we've whitewashed his image to that of a peaceful dreamer, but you can not read or hear him without feeling that palpable sense of frustration, fury and anger. Or perhaps you can, which simply means, to me, you have no way to relate. And it's easy to say, \"Of course King was angry, this is a different time. This shouldn't apply now. We're not dealing with the same things as back then.\" But we are. We are dealing with the persistence of white supremacy as an ideology and the practice of racism as a determinant of black humanity. That the degree has lessened and the tactics changed does not make that any less true. Additionally, what King was responding to is the same type of white liberal malaise on display now. There remains an uneasiness with discussing American racism alongside the myth of American exceptionalism, because the myth is easier to digest. We continue to be asked to stop. We continue to be told we've won enough. Emancipation was supposed to be enough. \"Separate but equal\" was supposed to be enough. Brown v. Board of Education was supposed to be enough. The Civil Rights/Voting Acts were supposed to be enough. Affirmative action was supposed to be enough. A black president is supposed to be enough. Yet, here we are, facing mass incarceration, food insecurity, chronic unemployment, the erosion of the social safety net, income inequality, housing discrimination, police brutality and the seemingly unending deaths of our young people at the hands of police and armed vigilantes. Pardon the \"profound gloom.\" What some call depression or pessimism, I would call impatience and rage. Our impatience and rage is what has produced progress. That we are still impatient and angry reflects not black people's failing but how far America still has to go. My question/challenge to white people who claim to be on the side of equality and justice: when will you get just as angry that these things have been done in your name?\n\nWhen the tête-à-tête between Ta-Nehisi Coates and Jonathan Chait over black culture, the \"culture of poverty,\" President Obama, Paul Ryan and American racism started, it was somewhat fascinating, but has become what Tressie McMillan Cottom described as \" a nasty piece of cornbread. \" It has left a rotten taste in my mouth. That's mostly because, as congenial as the two have been toward one another, I detect in Chait's argument one of my greatest pet peeves: a white person attempting to talk a black person down from their justifiable rage. One of the issues that has come up in this debate is the way these two men view American history. Chait writes: Coates and I disagree about racial progress in America. Coates sees the Americas' racial history as a story of continuity of white supremacy. I see the sequence (I'd call it a progression, but that term would load the argument in my favor) that began with chattel slavery and has led to the Obama administration as a story of halting, painful, non-continuous, but clear improvement. What a luxury it must be to define the history of racism in America through the lens of progress. He goes on: Coates associates himself with a quote from Malcolm X: \"You don't stick a knife in a man's back nine inches, and then pull it out six inches and say you're making progress.\" The analogy defines out of existence the very possibility of steady progress. People who subscribe to this way of thinking won't agree with measures that reduce but fail to eliminate racial discrimination, or those that reduce but fail to eliminate poverty, or reduce but fail to eliminate medical deprivation. I have written before , for instance, about how slavery continues to poison white minds in ways white people are often unaware of. One can believe in the continued existence of racism and still think that the scale of the evil has fallen enormously since the 19th century.

It's really that simple. You inevitably bring to that analysis an outsider's perspective, and from that vantage point, progress of any measure looks astounding. It's particularly awe-inspiring if it allows you to feel less implicated in the reason for that struggle. But that's what we call privilege: the ability to observe \"improvement\" because you're not experiencing the ever present oppression. It clouds your judgment. It deludes you into believing you have the authority of objectivity. It breeds self-righteousness. It impedes true progress. This doesn't preclude Chait, or other white people, from having an opinion on the state of racism in America. But it must be understood that their whiteness, and therefore distance from the lived experience of racism, affords them much rosier view of what constitutes progress. Chait previously wrote, with a note of disappointment, \"I have never previously detected this level of pessimism in Coates's thinking before.\" He isn't alone. Andrew Sullivan and quite a few of his readers detect a \"profound gloom\" in Coates's writing as of late, a change, they say, from just a few years ago.

Chait, Sullivan and some anonymous emailers appear to want Coates to feel happier about the progress America has made in eliminating racism. Sure, there are still a few things left to hammer out, but c'mon, you've got to admit we've gotten better, right? Right? Here I find it instructive to revisit this passage from Martin Luther King, Jr.'s \"Letter from a Birmingham Jail\": We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed. Frankly, I have yet to engage in a direct action campaign that was \"well timed\" in the view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation. For years now I have heard the word \"Wait!\" It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This \"Wait\" has almost always meant \"Never.\" We must come to see, with one of our distinguished jurists, that \"justice too long delayed is justice denied.\" We have waited for more than 340 years for our constitutional and God given rights. The nations of Asia and Africa are moving with jetlike speed toward gaining political independence, but we still creep at horse and buggy pace toward gaining a cup of coffee at a lunch counter. Perhaps it is easy for those who have never felt the stinging darts of segregation to say, \"Wait.\" But when you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate filled policemen curse, kick and even kill your black brothers and sisters; when you see the vast majority of your twenty million Negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society; when you suddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to explain to your six year old daughter why she can't go to the public amusement park that has just been advertised on television, and see tears welling up in her eyes when she is told that Funtown is closed to colored children, and see ominous clouds of inferiority beginning to form in her little mental sky, and see her beginning to distort her personality by developing an unconscious bitterness toward white people; when you have to concoct an answer for a five year old son who is asking: \"Daddy, why do white people treat colored people so mean?\"; when you take a cross county drive and find it necessary to sleep night after night in the uncomfortable corners of your automobile because no motel will accept you; when you are humiliated day in and day out by nagging signs reading \"white\" and \"colored\"; when your first name becomes \"nigger,\" your middle name becomes \"boy\" (however old you are) and your last name becomes \"John,\" and your wife and mother are never given the respected title \"Mrs.\"; when you are harried by day and haunted by night by the fact that you are a Negro, living constantly at tiptoe stance, never quite knowing what to expect next, and are plagued with inner fears and outer resentments; when you are forever fighting a degenerating sense of \"nobodiness\"-then you will understand why we find it difficult to wait. There comes a time when the cup of endurance runs over, and men are no longer willing to be plunged into the abyss of despair. I hope, sirs, you can understand our legitimate and unavoidable impatience. That is an impatience born of rage. We don't associate King with anger, as we've whitewashed his image to that of a peaceful dreamer, but you can not read or hear him without feeling that palpable sense of frustration, fury and anger. Or perhaps you can, which simply means, to me, you have no way to relate. And it's easy to say, \"Of course King was angry, this is a different time. This shouldn't apply now. We're not dealing with the same things as back then.\" But we are. We are dealing with the persistence of white supremacy as an ideology and the practice of racism as a determinant of black humanity. That the degree has lessened and the tactics changed does not make that any less true. Additionally, what King was responding to is the same type of white liberal malaise on display now. There remains an uneasiness with discussing American racism alongside the myth of American exceptionalism, because the myth is easier to digest. We continue to be asked to stop. We continue to be told we've won enough. Emancipation was supposed to be enough. \"Separate but equal\" was supposed to be enough. Brown v. Board of Education was supposed to be enough. The Civil Rights/Voting Acts were supposed to be enough. Affirmative action was supposed to be enough. A black president is supposed to be enough. Yet, here we are, facing mass incarceration, food insecurity, chronic unemployment, the erosion of the social safety net, income inequality, housing discrimination, police brutality and the seemingly unending deaths of our young people at the hands of police and armed vigilantes. Pardon the \"profound gloom.\" What some call depression or pessimism, I would call impatience and rage. Our impatience and rage is what has produced progress. That we are still impatient and angry reflects not black people's failing but how far America still has to go. My question/challenge to white people who claim to be on the side of equality and justice: when will you get just as angry that these things have been done in your name?\n\nCoates associates himself with a quote from Malcolm X: \"You don't stick a knife in a man's back nine inches, and then pull it out six inches and say you're making progress.\" The analogy defines out of existence the very possibility of steady progress. People who subscribe to this way of thinking won't agree with measures that reduce but fail to eliminate racial discrimination, or those that reduce but fail to eliminate poverty, or reduce but fail to eliminate medical deprivation. I have written before , for instance, about how slavery continues to poison white minds in ways white people are often unaware of. One can believe in the continued existence of racism and still think that the scale of the evil has fallen enormously since the 19th century.

It's really that simple. You inevitably bring to that analysis an outsider's perspective, and from that vantage point, progress of any measure looks astounding. It's particularly awe-inspiring if it allows you to feel less implicated in the reason for that struggle. But that's what we call privilege: the ability to observe \"improvement\" because you're not experiencing the ever present oppression. It clouds your judgment. It deludes you into believing you have the authority of objectivity. It breeds self-righteousness. It impedes true progress. This doesn't preclude Chait, or other white people, from having an opinion on the state of racism in America. But it must be understood that their whiteness, and therefore distance from the lived experience of racism, affords them much rosier view of what constitutes progress. Chait previously wrote, with a note of disappointment, \"I have never previously detected this level of pessimism in Coates's thinking before.\" He isn't alone. Andrew Sullivan and quite a few of his readers detect a \"profound gloom\" in Coates's writing as of late, a change, they say, from just a few years ago. Where they see pessimism and gloom, I see anger, an anger I wish we saw more of. Anger helps build movements. Of course, anger alone isn't sufficient, but it has a galvanizing effect.

Frankly, I have yet to engage in a direct action campaign that was \"well timed\" in the view of those who have not suffered unduly from the disease of segregation. For years now I have heard the word \"Wait!\" It rings in the ear of every Negro with piercing familiarity. This \"Wait\" has almost always meant \"Never.\" We must come to see, with one of our distinguished jurists, that \"justice too long delayed is justice denied.\" We have waited for more than 340 years for our constitutional and God given rights. The nations of Asia and Africa are moving with jetlike speed toward gaining political independence, but we still creep at horse and buggy pace toward gaining a cup of coffee at a lunch counter. Perhaps it is easy for those who have never felt the stinging darts of segregation to say, \"Wait.\" But when you have seen vicious mobs lynch your mothers and fathers at will and drown your sisters and brothers at whim; when you have seen hate filled policemen curse, kick and even kill your black brothers and sisters; when you see the vast majority of your twenty million Negro brothers smothering in an airtight cage of poverty in the midst of an affluent society; when you suddenly find your tongue twisted and your speech stammering as you seek to explain to your six year old daughter why she can't go to the public amusement park that has just been advertised on television, and see tears welling up in her eyes when she is told that Funtown is closed to colored children, and see ominous clouds of inferiority beginning to form in her little mental sky, and see her beginning to distort her personality by developing an unconscious bitterness toward white people; when you have to concoct an answer for a five year old son who is asking: \"Daddy, why do white people treat colored people so mean?\"; when you take a cross county drive and find it necessary to sleep night after night in the uncomfortable corners of your automobile because no motel will accept you; when you are humiliated day in and day out by nagging signs reading \"white\" and \"colored\"; when your first name becomes \"nigger,\" your middle name becomes \"boy\" (however old you are) and your last name becomes \"John,\" and your wife and mother are never given the respected title \"Mrs.\"; when you are harried by day and haunted by night by the fact that you are a Negro, living constantly at tiptoe stance, never quite knowing what to expect next, and are plagued with inner fears and outer resentments; when you are forever fighting a degenerating sense of \"nobodiness\"-then you will understand why we find it difficult to wait. There comes a time when the cup of endurance runs over, and men are no longer willing to be plunged into the abyss of despair. I hope, sirs, you can understand our legitimate and unavoidable impatience.\n\nWe have waited for more than 340 years for our constitutional and God given rights.

We don't associate King with anger, as we've whitewashed his image to that of a peaceful dreamer, but you can not read or hear him without feeling that palpable sense of frustration, fury and anger. Or perhaps you can, which simply means, to me, you have no way to relate. And it's easy to say, \"Of course King was angry, this is a different time. This shouldn't apply now. We're not dealing with the same things as back then.\" But we are. We are dealing with the persistence of white supremacy as an ideology and the practice of racism as a determinant of black humanity. That the degree has lessened and the tactics changed does not make that any less true. Additionally, what King was responding to is the same type of white liberal malaise on display now. There remains an uneasiness with discussing American racism alongside the myth of American exceptionalism, because the myth is easier to digest. We continue to be asked to stop. We continue to be told we've won enough. Emancipation was supposed to be enough. \"Separate but equal\" was supposed to be enough. Brown v. Board of Education was supposed to be enough. The Civil Rights/Voting Acts were supposed to be enough. Affirmative action was supposed to be enough. A black president is supposed to be enough. Yet, here we are, facing mass incarceration, food insecurity, chronic unemployment, the erosion of the social safety net, income inequality, housing discrimination, police brutality and the seemingly unending deaths of our young people at the hands of police and armed vigilantes. Pardon the \"profound gloom.\" What some call depression or pessimism, I would call impatience and rage. Our impatience and rage is what has produced progress. That we are still impatient and angry reflects not black people's failing but how far America still has to go.

This has also been buttressed, since the 1960s, by an interest in the \"Southern strategy\" that the Republican Party began to pursue with Barry Goldwater's vote against the Civil Rights Act in 1964 and that reached an apex with Richard Nixon's mastery of racial code words (\"states' rights,\" \"law and order\") in the 1968 presidential campaign. A new history by Anders Walker, The Burning House: Jim Crow and the Making of Modern America , touches on many of these events and their lingering legacies, but Walker directs our attention elsewhere: to those intellectuals who, in the second half of the 20th century, sought to save some of the unique qualities of Southern culture. Reviewed The Burning House: Jim Crow and the Making of Modern America By Anders Walker Buy this book The South, Walker argues, did more than offer heroic moments of black auto-emancipation and shameful moments of white supremacy; it also served as the arena for an ongoing debate over multiculturalism. This might seem like a strange assertion at first, as the politics of multiculturalism are usually framed in the context of the late 20th century, when conflicts over how to define a country's cultural identity exploded in Europe. But Walker's provocative thesis is this: Beginning in the 1940s, black and white writers-from Zora Neale Hurston to Robert Penn Warren-began to worry about what might happen to the South's culture in the wake of integration. These writers were not defenders of segregation; in fact, most were active in helping tear it down. But they feared that the region might also lose some of its cultural heterogeneity: In particular, they worried that it might lose its distinct white and black cultures and become flattened into the more homogeneous culture found in the rest of America. One might argue with this thesis on a variety of accounts. Thinking of the South as having two distinct cultures, one white, one black, as opposed to one culture that was a mixture of the two, is already highly questionable. For that matter, it is unclear if the rest of the nation was truly as monocultural as some of the intellectuals in Walker's book seem to believe. The work of historians like Jon Lauck, for instance, reminds us that the Midwest has its own rich literary and cultural heritage-to say nothing of the significant racial and ethnic cultures that permeated other regions of the United States outside the South. Even so, Walker has opened up a fresh way of thinking about the intellectual history of the South during the civil-rights movement, and he also asks some tough questions about how we should remember its legacy. A professor of law at Saint Louis University, Walker focused his first book, The Ghost of Jim Crow , on the white Southern moderates who, under the guise of promoting gradual progress and \"respect\" for African-American culture, tried to slow the implementation of the Supreme Court's landmark Brown v. Board of Education ruling in the late 1950s. In The Burning House , we get a different set of ghost stories about the afterlife of Jim Crow, but it's a book that follows the same line of reasoning, showing how the multicultural arguments made by intellectuals who wanted to sustain the South's cultural heterogeneity had their own unintended consequences, ending up being used by Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell in his effort to undermine affirmative action's constitutional standing.

Hurston and Warren, as well as James Baldwin, William Faulkner, Harper Lee, Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, Flannery O'Connor, Eudora Welty, and Stokely Carmichael, all make appearances. Not all of these people were from the South-Baldwin and Carmichael grew up in New York, for instance-but nearly all of them spent much of their lives fighting against or writing about the region's segregation. For these writers, culture and politics were never far apart. This was particularly true for Warren, who saw the cultural strength of the South as proof that the region needed nothing more than to reform its Jim Crow system-as opposed to a wholesale revolution overturning it. Other writers discussed in the book, such as Faulkner, promoted a similar ideology of the South being culturally superior to the rest of the nation due to the biracial and bicultural system arising from Jim Crow. Walker doesn't pull any punches when it comes to these white intellectuals. Their arguments for a biracial culture ultimately served to empower white Southerners, not black ones, and Walker's story is very much about the untenable nature of their position. White Southern liberals had to choose between civil and human rights, on the one hand, and white-supremacist regimes, on the other; there was no middle ground. Seeking to preserve the South's biracial character, in a context in which black Americans and their culture were not treated equally, figures like Warren ended up only helping to reinforce African Americans' unequal status in the South. And so it is not surprising that many of these arguments were later invoked by people like Powell. Walker's argument becomes trickier when it involves those black writers who also expressed trepidation about the future of the South's black culture and wanted to find a way to preserve it. In particular, many of these black intellectuals and activists worried about what would happen if, as Baldwin put it, black culture was integrated into the \"burning house\" of the United States. For Walker, this is what makes this generation of black writers so historically intriguing. They found the moderate position taken by white Southern liberals like Warren baneful, and they frequently challenged it. Yet they also questioned the bleak, materialist ethos of modern American culture and hoped that black culture might be able to preserve some of its unique characteristics-especially black culture as it existed in the South. Current Issue View our current issue In one of the more eye-opening sections of The Burning House , Walker explores Warren's interview with Carmichael just as the latter was beginning to enter his more radical phase in the mid-1960s. Warren initially expected Carmichael and other young black activists to support the integrationist drive not only in civil society and legal institutions, but also on questions relating to culture. So he was surprised to find Carmichael embracing a view of African-American cultural separation. When the two met in 1964, Carmichael had not yet made his complete turn to Black Power. But the ideas that formed the basis of the movement-self-reliance and a pride in African-American culture-were already there for Carmichael to adopt. In the interview, Warren asks Carmichael why nonviolence mattered. Carmichael explains: \"I never took the approach we've got to teach them to love us.... I thought that was nonsense from the start. But I was impressed by the way [the demonstrators] conducted themselves, the way they sat there and took the punishment.\" For Carmichael, the compelling feature of the civil-rights movement's nonviolence wasn't its ethical appeal, but that it represented an act of black resolve, a symbol of independence and black Americans' power on their own. For Warren, Walker notes, this \"incipient iteration of Black Power proved a coup...enabling him to demonstrate that pluralism reigned even among young black activists, who demonstrated little interest in joining white society or culture.\" But it's hard to ignore the cynicism operating here. Warren and other white Southerners who wanted to see Southern white culture preserved had found few allies within the civil-rights movement; with figures like Baldwin and Carmichael, Warren wanted to show black Americans were making a similar argument. Baldwin and Carmichael, on the other hand, felt they had little in common with someone like Warren. Between them was a large gulf: Warren was in pursuit of a cultural pluralism for the sake of a once-dominant culture; Baldwin and Carmichael wanted a pluralism that might help emancipate and protect a culture that for centuries had been violently suppressed. W alker picks up some of these ambiguities in the second thread of his book, which chronicles the story of Lewis F. Powell Jr. A Virginia-born lawyer who served as a Supreme Court justice from 1972 to 1987, Powell is infamous among progressives for the so-called \"Powell Memo,\" which he wrote in 1971 to the US Chamber of Commerce, arguing that American business should become more involved in politics. What is less known-but for Walker is of immense importance-is the role that Powell played in defining a conservative idea of \"diversity\" in several Supreme Court decisions in the 1970s concerning school segregation and affirmative action in college admissions. In Keyes v. School District No. 1 (1973), Powell wrote a concurring opinion insisting that local community control of schools-and therefore de facto segregation-was constitutional. If, for example, various government programs had pushed African Americans into lower-income areas with fewer sources of funding for their schools, then so be it: The federal government, in Powell's view, had no power to change such conditions, because to do so risked damaging the cultural autonomy of local communities. \"As Powell saw it, Brown demanded an end to overtly segregationist law, nothing more,\" Walker writes. Integration was a laudable goal, Powell claimed, but it could not be administered by the federal government, only by local school districts. More importantly, however, this opinion was an example of Powell arguing publicly that the South was, in Walker's words, \"no more guilty of racial injustice than anyplace else.\" One can begin to hear how Warren's multicultural argument intersects with Powell's defense of segregation in the Keyes concurrence. But Powell's biggest contribution to the modern history of race and law came in the Court's decision in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke (1978), when he argued that diversity could be taken into account as a factor in college admissions, but not to respond to historical injustice against African Americans. Instead, Powell thought that the only reason diversity could be taken into account was when it was designed to promote \"academic freedom.\" As Walker notes, this kind of argument, like the Southern moderates' position examined in his first book, purportedly seeks to protect the \"diversity\" of cultural institutions but is, in fact, \"hostile to aggressive government efforts aimed at achieving equality.\" Like Warren, Powell made a case for multicultural pluralism that ultimately weakened the idea of social, as well as cultural, integration. It is no coincidence that Powell's rise to the Supreme Court in the early 1970s came just as the nation was attempting to reckon with the meaning of \"Southernness.\" Scholars like John Egerton, who wrote The Americanization of Dixie , and politicians like Jimmy Carter had started to ask serious questions about what it meant to be a white Southerner after the successes of the civil-rights movement. As a result, Walker argues, it was not only Powell and his fellow conservatives who found in cultural pluralism a means to enliven Southern identity; it was also liberals like Carter, who argued during his 1976 presidential campaign that \"people have a tendency-and it is an unshakable tendency-to want to share common social clubs, common churches, common restaurants,\" an argument that runs very closely to the one being made by those in the North and the South who sought to resegregate schools and neighborhoods. Had The Burning House 's sections on the 1970s included Albert Murray, Walker would have found a fascinating foil for the arguments made by the likes of Warren and Powell. While offering glowing portraits of black culture in the South, Murray also argued in his 1970 The Omni-Americans that it was through these different cultures that a national American culture would emerge. \"Ethnic differences,\" Murray wrote, \"are the very essence of cultural diversity and national creativity.\" One could have a cultural pluralism while also not giving way to Warren's vision of a dual Southern culture, or Powell's use of \"diversity\" to defend de facto segregation and racial inequality. That Murray's argument never gained a larger audience in his time was a symbol of the dominance of an American culture that, in the 1970s, wanted to move beyond concern about the antiblack racism associated with images of marches in the South. Threading the needle on race, culture, and diversity would be a bit easier if more intellectuals had wrestled with Murray's example. S cholars and historians of the South have, in recent years, started to reflect on the diversity of thought in the region. Zandria Robinson's This Ain't Chicago makes a compelling argument for the differences between African Americans in the North and the South. Jason Sokol's There Goes My Everything attempts to unveil the reactions of white Southerners to the revolution taking place around them. The Burning House fits well within the growing literature about the modern South, a literature that does not assume \"Southern exceptionalism\"-the view that the South's history and culture are radically different from the rest of the nation-but, instead, attempts to understand the region from a variety of different viewpoints. Even so, one weakness of The Burning House is that it's not entirely clear that Powell was directly influenced by the Southern writers profiled in the first two-thirds of the book. It would be easy to assume that he came from the same ideological tradition as most of the white writers in Walker's book, an ideology that criticized the worst excesses of Jim Crow while also remaining uncomfortable with integration. But there's never a \"smoking gun\" to indicate that Powell gave credit to Warren for his Supreme Court rulings. Likewise, as Baldwin and Carmichael would have noted, there's a world of difference between the cultural pluralism of black writers seeking an independent African-American culture and white ones seeking some continuation of the \"Southern way of life.\" After all, the Southern way of life for much of America's history meant a world of slavery and racial hierarchy. That was hardly the kind of Southern culture that black intellectuals were calling for. Nonetheless, The Burning House is a worthwhile book for anyone interested in the continuing importance of the South to the nation's culture and politics. The recent off-year election in Virginia and the Senate special election in Alabama have proved that the road to a progressive future for the United States goes through the South. The Burning House reminds us that this road will be marked by twists, turns, and hazardous pitfalls. \"Ethnic differences are the very essence of cultural diversity and national creativity,\" Murray wrote in the introduction to The Omni-Americans . Understanding the fraught relationship between diversity and power-whether economic, political, or social-is something that still eludes most Americans.\n\nBy Anders Walker\n\nBuy this book\n\nThe South, Walker argues, did more than offer heroic moments of black auto-emancipation and shameful moments of white supremacy; it also served as the arena for an ongoing debate over multiculturalism.

For Warren, Walker notes, this \"incipient iteration of Black Power proved a coup...enabling him to demonstrate that pluralism reigned even among young black activists, who demonstrated little interest in joining white society or culture.\" But it's hard to ignore the cynicism operating here. Warren and other white Southerners who wanted to see Southern white culture preserved had found few allies within the civil-rights movement; with figures like Baldwin and Carmichael, Warren wanted to show black Americans were making a similar argument. Baldwin and Carmichael, on the other hand, felt they had little in common with someone like Warren. Between them was a large gulf: Warren was in pursuit of a cultural pluralism for the sake of a once-dominant culture; Baldwin and Carmichael wanted a pluralism that might help emancipate and protect a culture that for centuries had been violently suppressed. W alker picks up some of these ambiguities in the second thread of his book, which chronicles the story of Lewis F. Powell Jr. A Virginia-born lawyer who served as a Supreme Court justice from 1972 to 1987, Powell is infamous among progressives for the so-called \"Powell Memo,\" which he wrote in 1971 to the US Chamber of Commerce, arguing that American business should become more involved in politics. What is less known-but for Walker is of immense importance-is the role that Powell played in defining a conservative idea of \"diversity\" in several Supreme Court decisions in the 1970s concerning school segregation and affirmative action in college admissions. In Keyes v. School District No. 1 (1973), Powell wrote a concurring opinion insisting that local community control of schools-and therefore de facto segregation-was constitutional. If, for example, various government programs had pushed African Americans into lower-income areas with fewer sources of funding for their schools, then so be it: The federal government, in Powell's view, had no power to change such conditions, because to do so risked damaging the cultural autonomy of local communities. \"As Powell saw it, Brown demanded an end to overtly segregationist law, nothing more,\" Walker writes. Integration was a laudable goal, Powell claimed, but it could not be administered by the federal government, only by local school districts. More importantly, however, this opinion was an example of Powell arguing publicly that the South was, in Walker's words, \"no more guilty of racial injustice than anyplace else.\" One can begin to hear how Warren's multicultural argument intersects with Powell's defense of segregation in the Keyes concurrence. But Powell's biggest contribution to the modern history of race and law came in the Court's decision in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke (1978), when he argued that diversity could be taken into account as a factor in college admissions, but not to respond to historical injustice against African Americans. Instead, Powell thought that the only reason diversity could be taken into account was when it was designed to promote \"academic freedom.\" As Walker notes, this kind of argument, like the Southern moderates' position examined in his first book, purportedly seeks to protect the \"diversity\" of cultural institutions but is, in fact, \"hostile to aggressive government efforts aimed at achieving equality.\" Like Warren, Powell made a case for multicultural pluralism that ultimately weakened the idea of social, as well as cultural, integration. It is no coincidence that Powell's rise to the Supreme Court in the early 1970s came just as the nation was attempting to reckon with the meaning of \"Southernness.\" Scholars like John Egerton, who wrote The Americanization of Dixie , and politicians like Jimmy Carter had started to ask serious questions about what it meant to be a white Southerner after the successes of the civil-rights movement. As a result, Walker argues, it was not only Powell and his fellow conservatives who found in cultural pluralism a means to enliven Southern identity; it was also liberals like Carter, who argued during his 1976 presidential campaign that \"people have a tendency-and it is an unshakable tendency-to want to share common social clubs, common churches, common restaurants,\" an argument that runs very closely to the one being made by those in the North and the South who sought to resegregate schools and neighborhoods. Had The Burning House 's sections on the 1970s included Albert Murray, Walker would have found a fascinating foil for the arguments made by the likes of Warren and Powell. While offering glowing portraits of black culture in the South, Murray also argued in his 1970 The Omni-Americans that it was through these different cultures that a national American culture would emerge. \"Ethnic differences,\" Murray wrote, \"are the very essence of cultural diversity and national creativity.\" One could have a cultural pluralism while also not giving way to Warren's vision of a dual Southern culture, or Powell's use of \"diversity\" to defend de facto segregation and racial inequality. That Murray's argument never gained a larger audience in his time was a symbol of the dominance of an American culture that, in the 1970s, wanted to move beyond concern about the antiblack racism associated with images of marches in the South. Threading the needle on race, culture, and diversity would be a bit easier if more intellectuals had wrestled with Murray's example. S cholars and historians of the South have, in recent years, started to reflect on the diversity of thought in the region. Zandria Robinson's This Ain't Chicago makes a compelling argument for the differences between African Americans in the North and the South. Jason Sokol's There Goes My Everything attempts to unveil the reactions of white Southerners to the revolution taking place around them. The Burning House fits well within the growing literature about the modern South, a literature that does not assume \"Southern exceptionalism\"-the view that the South's history and culture are radically different from the rest of the nation-but, instead, attempts to understand the region from a variety of different viewpoints. Even so, one weakness of The Burning House is that it's not entirely clear that Powell was directly influenced by the Southern writers profiled in the first two-thirds of the book. It would be easy to assume that he came from the same ideological tradition as most of the white writers in Walker's book, an ideology that criticized the worst excesses of Jim Crow while also remaining uncomfortable with integration. But there's never a \"smoking gun\" to indicate that Powell gave credit to Warren for his Supreme Court rulings. Likewise, as Baldwin and Carmichael would have noted, there's a world of difference between the cultural pluralism of black writers seeking an independent African-American culture and white ones seeking some continuation of the \"Southern way of life.\" After all, the Southern way of life for much of America's history meant a world of slavery and racial hierarchy. That was hardly the kind of Southern culture that black intellectuals were calling for. Nonetheless, The Burning House is a worthwhile book for anyone interested in the continuing importance of the South to the nation's culture and politics. The recent off-year election in Virginia and the Senate special election in Alabama have proved that the road to a progressive future for the United States goes through the South. The Burning House reminds us that this road will be marked by twists, turns, and hazardous pitfalls. \"Ethnic differences are the very essence of cultural diversity and national creativity,\" Murray wrote in the introduction to The Omni-Americans . Understanding the fraught relationship between diversity and power-whether economic, political, or social-is something that still eludes most Americans.\n\nOne might argue with this thesis on a variety of accounts. Thinking of the South as having two distinct cultures, one white, one black, as opposed to one culture that was a mixture of the two, is already highly questionable. For that matter, it is unclear if the rest of the nation was truly as monocultural as some of the intellectuals in Walker's book seem to believe. The work of historians like Jon Lauck, for instance, reminds us that the Midwest has its own rich literary and cultural heritage-to say nothing of the significant racial and ethnic cultures that permeated other regions of the United States outside the South. Even so, Walker has opened up a fresh way of thinking about the intellectual history of the South during the civil-rights movement, and he also asks some tough questions about how we should remember its legacy. A professor of law at Saint Louis University, Walker focused his first book, The Ghost of Jim Crow , on the white Southern moderates who, under the guise of promoting gradual progress and \"respect\" for African-American culture, tried to slow the implementation of the Supreme Court's landmark Brown v. Board of Education ruling in the late 1950s. In The Burning House , we get a different set of ghost stories about the afterlife of Jim Crow, but it's a book that follows the same line of reasoning, showing how the multicultural arguments made by intellectuals who wanted to sustain the South's cultural heterogeneity had their own unintended consequences, ending up being used by Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell in his effort to undermine affirmative action's constitutional standing.

Hurston and Warren, as well as James Baldwin, William Faulkner, Harper Lee, Richard Wright, Ralph Ellison, Flannery O'Connor, Eudora Welty, and Stokely Carmichael, all make appearances. Not all of these people were from the South-Baldwin and Carmichael grew up in New York, for instance-but nearly all of them spent much of their lives fighting against or writing about the region's segregation. For these writers, culture and politics were never far apart. This was particularly true for Warren, who saw the cultural strength of the South as proof that the region needed nothing more than to reform its Jim Crow system-as opposed to a wholesale revolution overturning it. Other writers discussed in the book, such as Faulkner, promoted a similar ideology of the South being culturally superior to the rest of the nation due to the biracial and bicultural system arising from Jim Crow. Walker doesn't pull any punches when it comes to these white intellectuals. Their arguments for a biracial culture ultimately served to empower white Southerners, not black ones, and Walker's story is very much about the untenable nature of their position. White Southern liberals had to choose between civil and human rights, on the one hand, and white-supremacist regimes, on the other; there was no middle ground. Seeking to preserve the South's biracial character, in a context in which black Americans and their culture were not treated equally, figures like Warren ended up only helping to reinforce African Americans' unequal status in the South. And so it is not surprising that many of these arguments were later invoked by people like Powell. Walker's argument becomes trickier when it involves those black writers who also expressed trepidation about the future of the South's black culture and wanted to find a way to preserve it. In particular, many of these black intellectuals and activists worried about what would happen if, as Baldwin put it, black culture was integrated into the \"burning house\" of the United States. For Walker, this is what makes this generation of black writers so historically intriguing. They found the moderate position taken by white Southern liberals like Warren baneful, and they frequently challenged it. Yet they also questioned the bleak, materialist ethos of modern American culture and hoped that black culture might be able to preserve some of its unique characteristics-especially black culture as it existed in the South. Current Issue View our current issue In one of the more eye-opening sections of The Burning House , Walker explores Warren's interview with Carmichael just as the latter was beginning to enter his more radical phase in the mid-1960s. Warren initially expected Carmichael and other young black activists to support the integrationist drive not only in civil society and legal institutions, but also on questions relating to culture. So he was surprised to find Carmichael embracing a view of African-American cultural separation. When the two met in 1964, Carmichael had not yet made his complete turn to Black Power. But the ideas that formed the basis of the movement-self-reliance and a pride in African-American culture-were already there for Carmichael to adopt. In the interview, Warren asks Carmichael why nonviolence mattered. Carmichael explains: \"I never took the approach we've got to teach them to love us.... I thought that was nonsense from the start. But I was impressed by the way [the demonstrators] conducted themselves, the way they sat there and took the punishment.\" For Carmichael, the compelling feature of the civil-rights movement's nonviolence wasn't its ethical appeal, but that it represented an act of black resolve, a symbol of independence and black Americans' power on their own.

In particular, many of these black intellectuals and activists worried about what would happen if, as Baldwin put it, black culture was integrated into the \"burning house\" of the United States. For Walker, this is what makes this generation of black writers so historically intriguing. They found the moderate position taken by white Southern liberals like Warren baneful, and they frequently challenged it. Yet they also questioned the bleak, materialist ethos of modern American culture and hoped that black culture might be able to preserve some of its unique characteristics-especially black culture as it existed in the South. Current Issue View our current issue In one of the more eye-opening sections of The Burning House , Walker explores Warren's interview with Carmichael just as the latter was beginning to enter his more radical phase in the mid-1960s. Warren initially expected Carmichael and other young black activists to support the integrationist drive not only in civil society and legal institutions, but also on questions relating to culture. So he was surprised to find Carmichael embracing a view of African-American cultural separation. When the two met in 1964, Carmichael had not yet made his complete turn to Black Power. But the ideas that formed the basis of the movement-self-reliance and a pride in African-American culture-were already there for Carmichael to adopt. In the interview, Warren asks Carmichael why nonviolence mattered. Carmichael explains: \"I never took the approach we've got to teach them to love us.... I thought that was nonsense from the start. But I was impressed by the way [the demonstrators] conducted themselves, the way they sat there and took the punishment.\" For Carmichael, the compelling feature of the civil-rights movement's nonviolence wasn't its ethical appeal, but that it represented an act of black resolve, a symbol of independence and black Americans' power on their own. For Warren, Walker notes, this \"incipient iteration of Black Power proved a coup...enabling him to demonstrate that pluralism reigned even among young black activists, who demonstrated little interest in joining white society or culture.\" But it's hard to ignore the cynicism operating here. Warren and other white Southerners who wanted to see Southern white culture preserved had found few allies within the civil-rights movement; with figures like Baldwin and Carmichael, Warren wanted to show black Americans were making a similar argument. Baldwin and Carmichael, on the other hand, felt they had little in common with someone like Warren. Between them was a large gulf: Warren was in pursuit of a cultural pluralism for the sake of a once-dominant culture; Baldwin and Carmichael wanted a pluralism that might help emancipate and protect a culture that for centuries had been violently suppressed. W alker picks up some of these ambiguities in the second thread of his book, which chronicles the story of Lewis F. Powell Jr. A Virginia-born lawyer who served as a Supreme Court justice from 1972 to 1987, Powell is infamous among progressives for the so-called \"Powell Memo,\" which he wrote in 1971 to the US Chamber of Commerce, arguing that American business should become more involved in politics. What is less known-but for Walker is of immense importance-is the role that Powell played in defining a conservative idea of \"diversity\" in several Supreme Court decisions in the 1970s concerning school segregation and affirmative action in college admissions. In Keyes v. School District No. 1 (1973), Powell wrote a concurring opinion insisting that local community control of schools-and therefore de facto segregation-was constitutional. If, for example, various government programs had pushed African Americans into lower-income areas with fewer sources of funding for their schools, then so be it: The federal government, in Powell's view, had no power to change such conditions, because to do so risked damaging the cultural autonomy of local communities. \"As Powell saw it, Brown demanded an end to overtly segregationist law, nothing more,\" Walker writes. Integration was a laudable goal, Powell claimed, but it could not be administered by the federal government, only by local school districts. More importantly, however, this opinion was an example of Powell arguing publicly that the South was, in Walker's words, \"no more guilty of racial injustice than anyplace else.\" One can begin to hear how Warren's multicultural argument intersects with Powell's defense of segregation in the Keyes concurrence. But Powell's biggest contribution to the modern history of race and law came in the Court's decision in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke (1978), when he argued that diversity could be taken into account as a factor in college admissions, but not to respond to historical injustice against African Americans. Instead, Powell thought that the only reason diversity could be taken into account was when it was designed to promote \"academic freedom.\" As Walker notes, this kind of argument, like the Southern moderates' position examined in his first book, purportedly seeks to protect the \"diversity\" of cultural institutions but is, in fact, \"hostile to aggressive government efforts aimed at achieving equality.\" Like Warren, Powell made a case for multicultural pluralism that ultimately weakened the idea of social, as well as cultural, integration. It is no coincidence that Powell's rise to the Supreme Court in the early 1970s came just as the nation was attempting to reckon with the meaning of \"Southernness.\" Scholars like John Egerton, who wrote The Americanization of Dixie , and politicians like Jimmy Carter had started to ask serious questions about what it meant to be a white Southerner after the successes of the civil-rights movement. As a result, Walker argues, it was not only Powell and his fellow conservatives who found in cultural pluralism a means to enliven Southern identity; it was also liberals like Carter, who argued during his 1976 presidential campaign that \"people have a tendency-and it is an unshakable tendency-to want to share common social clubs, common churches, common restaurants,\" an argument that runs very closely to the one being made by those in the North and the South who sought to resegregate schools and neighborhoods. Had The Burning House 's sections on the 1970s included Albert Murray, Walker would have found a fascinating foil for the arguments made by the likes of Warren and Powell. While offering glowing portraits of black culture in the South, Murray also argued in his 1970 The Omni-Americans that it was through these different cultures that a national American culture would emerge. \"Ethnic differences,\" Murray wrote, \"are the very essence of cultural diversity and national creativity.\" One could have a cultural pluralism while also not giving way to Warren's vision of a dual Southern culture, or Powell's use of \"diversity\" to defend de facto segregation and racial inequality. That Murray's argument never gained a larger audience in his time was a symbol of the dominance of an American culture that, in the 1970s, wanted to move beyond concern about the antiblack racism associated with images of marches in the South. Threading the needle on race, culture, and diversity would be a bit easier if more intellectuals had wrestled with Murray's example. S cholars and historians of the South have, in recent years, started to reflect on the diversity of thought in the region. Zandria Robinson's This Ain't Chicago makes a compelling argument for the differences between African Americans in the North and the South. Jason Sokol's There Goes My Everything attempts to unveil the reactions of white Southerners to the revolution taking place around them. The Burning House fits well within the growing literature about the modern South, a literature that does not assume \"Southern exceptionalism\"-the view that the South's history and culture are radically different from the rest of the nation-but, instead, attempts to understand the region from a variety of different viewpoints. Even so, one weakness of The Burning House is that it's not entirely clear that Powell was directly influenced by the Southern writers profiled in the first two-thirds of the book. It would be easy to assume that he came from the same ideological tradition as most of the white writers in Walker's book, an ideology that criticized the worst excesses of Jim Crow while also remaining uncomfortable with integration. But there's never a \"smoking gun\" to indicate that Powell gave credit to Warren for his Supreme Court rulings. Likewise, as Baldwin and Carmichael would have noted, there's a world of difference between the cultural pluralism of black writers seeking an independent African-American culture and white ones seeking some continuation of the \"Southern way of life.\" After all, the Southern way of life for much of America's history meant a world of slavery and racial hierarchy. That was hardly the kind of Southern culture that black intellectuals were calling for. Nonetheless, The Burning House is a worthwhile book for anyone interested in the continuing importance of the South to the nation's culture and politics. The recent off-year election in Virginia and the Senate special election in Alabama have proved that the road to a progressive future for the United States goes through the South. The Burning House reminds us that this road will be marked by twists, turns, and hazardous pitfalls. \"Ethnic differences are the very essence of cultural diversity and national creativity,\" Murray wrote in the introduction to The Omni-Americans . Understanding the fraught relationship between diversity and power-whether economic, political, or social-is something that still eludes most Americans.\n\nWalker doesn't pull any punches when it comes to these white intellectuals. Their arguments for a biracial culture ultimately served to empower white Southerners, not black ones, and Walker's story is very much about the untenable nature of their position. White Southern liberals had to choose between civil and human rights, on the one hand, and white-supremacist regimes, on the other; there was no middle ground. Seeking to preserve the South's biracial character, in a context in which black Americans and their culture were not treated equally, figures like Warren ended up only helping to reinforce African Americans' unequal status in the South. And so it is not surprising that many of these arguments were later invoked by people like Powell. Walker's argument becomes trickier when it involves those black writers who also expressed trepidation about the future of the South's black culture and wanted to find a way to preserve it. In particular, many of these black intellectuals and activists worried about what would happen if, as Baldwin put it, black culture was integrated into the \"burning house\" of the United States.

The recent off-year election in Virginia and the Senate special election in Alabama have proved that the road to a progressive future for the United States goes through the South. The Burning House reminds us that this road will be marked by twists, turns, and hazardous pitfalls. \"Ethnic differences are the very essence of cultural diversity and national creativity,\" Murray wrote in the introduction to The Omni-Americans . Understanding the fraught relationship between diversity and power-whether economic, political, or social-is something that still eludes most Americans.\n\nFor Warren, Walker notes, this \"incipient iteration of Black Power proved a coup...enabling him to demonstrate that pluralism reigned even among young black activists, who demonstrated little interest in joining white society or culture.\" But it's hard to ignore the cynicism operating here. Warren and other white Southerners who wanted to see Southern white culture preserved had found few allies within the civil-rights movement; with figures like Baldwin and Carmichael, Warren wanted to show black Americans were making a similar argument. Baldwin and Carmichael, on the other hand, felt they had little in common with someone like Warren. Between them was a large gulf: Warren was in pursuit of a cultural pluralism for the sake of a once-dominant culture; Baldwin and Carmichael wanted a pluralism that might help emancipate and protect a culture that for centuries had been violently suppressed. W alker picks up some of these ambiguities in the second thread of his book, which chronicles the story of Lewis F. Powell Jr. A Virginia-born lawyer who served as a Supreme Court justice from 1972 to 1987, Powell is infamous among progressives for the so-called \"Powell Memo,\" which he wrote in 1971 to the US Chamber of Commerce, arguing that American business should become more involved in politics. What is less known-but for Walker is of immense importance-is the role that Powell played in defining a conservative idea of \"diversity\" in several Supreme Court decisions in the 1970s concerning school segregation and affirmative action in college admissions. In Keyes v. School District No. 1 (1973), Powell wrote a concurring opinion insisting that local community control of schools-and therefore de facto segregation-was constitutional. If, for example, various government programs had pushed African Americans into lower-income areas with fewer sources of funding for their schools, then so be it: The federal government, in Powell's view, had no power to change such conditions, because to do so risked damaging the cultural autonomy of local communities. \"As Powell saw it, Brown demanded an end to overtly segregationist law, nothing more,\" Walker writes. Integration was a laudable goal, Powell claimed, but it could not be administered by the federal government, only by local school districts. More importantly, however, this opinion was an example of Powell arguing publicly that the South was, in Walker's words, \"no more guilty of racial injustice than anyplace else.\" One can begin to hear how Warren's multicultural argument intersects with Powell's defense of segregation in the Keyes concurrence. But Powell's biggest contribution to the modern history of race and law came in the Court's decision in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke (1978), when he argued that diversity could be taken into account as a factor in college admissions, but not to respond to historical injustice against African Americans. Instead, Powell thought that the only reason diversity could be taken into account was when it was designed to promote \"academic freedom.\" As Walker notes, this kind of argument, like the Southern moderates' position examined in his first book, purportedly seeks to protect the \"diversity\" of cultural institutions but is, in fact, \"hostile to aggressive government efforts aimed at achieving equality.\" Like Warren, Powell made a case for multicultural pluralism that ultimately weakened the idea of social, as well as cultural, integration. It is no coincidence that Powell's rise to the Supreme Court in the early 1970s came just as the nation was attempting to reckon with the meaning of \"Southernness.\" Scholars like John Egerton, who wrote The Americanization of Dixie , and politicians like Jimmy Carter had started to ask serious questions about what it meant to be a white Southerner after the successes of the civil-rights movement. As a result, Walker argues, it was not only Powell and his fellow conservatives who found in cultural pluralism a means to enliven Southern identity; it was also liberals like Carter, who argued during his 1976 presidential campaign that \"people have a tendency-and it is an unshakable tendency-to want to share common social clubs, common churches, common restaurants,\" an argument that runs very closely to the one being made by those in the North and the South who sought to resegregate schools and neighborhoods. Had The Burning House 's sections on the 1970s included Albert Murray, Walker would have found a fascinating foil for the arguments made by the likes of Warren and Powell. While offering glowing portraits of black culture in the South, Murray also argued in his 1970 The Omni-Americans that it was through these different cultures that a national American culture would emerge. \"Ethnic differences,\" Murray wrote, \"are the very essence of cultural diversity and national creativity.\" One could have a cultural pluralism while also not giving way to Warren's vision of a dual Southern culture, or Powell's use of \"diversity\" to defend de facto segregation and racial inequality. That Murray's argument never gained a larger audience in his time was a symbol of the dominance of an American culture that, in the 1970s, wanted to move beyond concern about the antiblack racism associated with images of marches in the South. Threading the needle on race, culture, and diversity would be a bit easier if more intellectuals had wrestled with Murray's example. S cholars and historians of the South have, in recent years, started to reflect on the diversity of thought in the region. Zandria Robinson's This Ain't Chicago makes a compelling argument for the differences between African Americans in the North and the South. Jason Sokol's There Goes My Everything attempts to unveil the reactions of white Southerners to the revolution taking place around them. The Burning House fits well within the growing literature about the modern South, a literature that does not assume \"Southern exceptionalism\"-the view that the South's history and culture are radically different from the rest of the nation-but, instead, attempts to understand the region from a variety of different viewpoints. Even so, one weakness of The Burning House is that it's not entirely clear that Powell was directly influenced by the Southern writers profiled in the first two-thirds of the book. It would be easy to assume that he came from the same ideological tradition as most of the white writers in Walker's book, an ideology that criticized the worst excesses of Jim Crow while also remaining uncomfortable with integration. But there's never a \"smoking gun\" to indicate that Powell gave credit to Warren for his Supreme Court rulings. Likewise, as Baldwin and Carmichael would have noted, there's a world of difference between the cultural pluralism of black writers seeking an independent African-American culture and white ones seeking some continuation of the \"Southern way of life.\" After all, the Southern way of life for much of America's history meant a world of slavery and racial hierarchy. That was hardly the kind of Southern culture that black intellectuals were calling for. Nonetheless, The Burning House is a worthwhile book for anyone interested in the continuing importance of the South to the nation's culture and politics.

      "text": "Why Is Everyone Always Stealing Black Music?\n\nBy WESLEY MORRIS AUG. 14, 2019\n\nBecause it's the sound of complete artistic freedom.\n\nFor centuries, black music, forged in bondage, has been the sound of complete artistic freedom. No wonder everybody is always stealing it.\n\nBy Wesley Morris AUG. 14, 2019\n\nI've got a friend who's an incurable Pandora guy, and one Saturday while we were making dinner, he found a station called Yacht Rock . \"A tongue-in-cheek name for the breezy sounds of late '70s/early '80s soft rock\" is Pandora's definition, accompanied by an exhortation to \"put on your Dockers, pull up a deck chair and relax.\" With a single exception, the passengers aboard the yacht were all dudes. With two exceptions, they were all white. But as the hours passed and dozens of songs accrued, the sound gravitated toward a familiar quality that I couldn't give language to but could practically taste: an earnest Christian yearning that would reach, for a moment, into Baptist rawness, into a known warmth. I had to laugh - not because as a category Yacht Rock is absurd, but because what I tasted in that absurdity was black.\n\nI started putting each track under investigation. Which artists would saunter up to the racial border? And which could do their sauntering without violating it? I could hear degrees of blackness in the choir-loft certitude of Doobie Brothers-era Michael McDonald on \"What a Fool Believes\" ; in the rubber-band soul of Steely Dan's \"Do It Again\" ; in the malt-liquor misery of Ace's \"How Long\" and the toy-boat wistfulness of Little River Band's \"Reminiscing.\"\n\nThen Kenny Loggins's \"This Is It\" arrived and took things far beyond the line. \"This Is It\" was a hit in 1979 and has the requisite smoothness to keep the yacht rocking. But Loggins delivers the lyrics in a desperate stage whisper, like someone determined to make the kind of love that doesn't wake the baby. What bowls you over is the intensity of his yearning - teary in the verses, snarling during the chorus. He sounds as if he's baring it all yet begging to wring himself out even more.\n\nPlaying black-music detective that day, I laughed out of bafflement and embarrassment and exhilaration. It's the conflation of pride and chagrin I've always felt anytime a white person inhabits blackness with gusto. It's: You have to hand it to her . It's: Go, white boy. Go, white boy . Go. But it's also: Here we go again . The problem is rich. If blackness can draw all of this ornate literariness out of Steely Dan and all this psychotic origami out of Eminem; if it can make Teena Marie sing everything - \"Square Biz,\" \"Revolution,\" \"Portuguese Love,\" \"Lovergirl\" - like she knows her way around a pack of Newports; if it can turn the chorus of Carly Simon's \"You Belong to Me\" into a gospel hymn; if it can animate the swagger in the sardonic vulnerabilities of Amy Winehouse ; if it can surface as unexpectedly as it does in the angelic angst of a singer as seemingly green as Ben Platt ; if it's the reason Nu Shooz's \"I Can't Wait\" remains the whitest jam at the blackest parties, then it's proof of how deeply it matters to the music of being alive in America, alive to America.\n\nIt's proof, too, that American music has been fated to thrive in an elaborate tangle almost from the beginning. Americans have made a political investment in a myth of racial separateness, the idea that art forms can be either \"white\" or \"black\" in character when aspects of many are at least both. The purity that separation struggles to maintain? This country's music is an advertisement for 400 years of the opposite: centuries of \"amalgamation\" and \"miscegenation\" as they long ago called it, of all manner of interracial collaboration conducted with dismaying ranges of consent.\n\n\"White,\" \"Western,\" \"classical\" music is the overarching basis for lots of American pop songs. Chromatic-chord harmony, clean timbre of voice and instrument: These are the ingredients for some of the hugely singable harmonies of the Beatles, the Eagles, Simon and Fleetwood Mac, something choral, \"pure,\" largely ungrained. Black music is a completely different story. It brims with call and response, layers of syncopation and this rougher element called \"noise,\" unique sounds that arise from the particular hue and timbre of an instrument - Little Richard's woos and knuckled keyboard zooms. The dusky heat of Miles Davis's trumpeting . Patti LaBelle's emotional police siren . DMX's scorched-earth bark . The visceral stank of Etta James , Aretha Franklin, live-in-concert Whitney Houston and Prince on electric guitar.\n\nBut there's something even more fundamental, too. My friend Delvyn Case, a musician who teaches at Wheaton College, explained in an email that improvisation is one of the most crucial elements in what we think of as black music: \"The raising of individual creativity/expression to the highest place within the aesthetic world of a song.\" Without improvisation, a listener is seduced into the composition of the song itself and not the distorting or deviating elements that noise creates. Particular to black American music is the architecture to create a means by which singers and musicians can be completely free, free in the only way that would have been possible on a plantation: through art, through music - music no one \"composed\" (because enslaved people were denied literacy), music born of feeling, of play, of exhaustion, of hope.\n\nWhat you're hearing in black music is a miracle of sound, an experience that can really happen only once - not just melisma, glissandi, the rasp of a sax, breakbeats or sampling but the mood or inspiration from which those moments arise. The attempt to rerecord it seems, if you think about it, like a fool's errand. You're not capturing the arrangement of notes, per se. You're catching the spirit.\n\n[Listen to an episode of the \"1619\" podcast with Wesley Morris and Nikole Hannah-Jones on the birth of American music.]\n\nAnd the spirit travels from host to host, racially indiscriminate about where it settles, selective only about who can withstand being possessed by it. The rockin' backwoods blues so bewitched Elvis Presley that he believed he'd been called by blackness. Chuck Berry sculpted rock 'n' roll with uproarious guitar riffs and lascivious winks at whiteness. Mick Jagger and Robert Plant and Steve Winwood and Janis Joplin and the Beatles jumped, jived and wailed the black blues. Tina Turner wrested it all back , tripling the octane in some of their songs. Since the 1830s, the historian Ann Douglas writes in \"Terrible Honesty,\" her history of popular culture in the 1920s, \"American entertainment, whatever the state of American society, has always been integrated, if only by theft and parody.\" What we've been dealing with ever since is more than a catchall word like \"appropriation\" can approximate. The truth is more bounteous and more spiritual than that, more confused. That confusion is the DNA of the American sound.\n\nIt's in the wink-wink costume funk of Beck's \"Midnite Vultures\" from 1999, an album whose kicky nonsense deprecations circle back to the popular culture of 150 years earlier. It's in the dead-serious, nostalgic dance-floor schmaltz of Bruno Mars . It's in what we once called \"blue-eyed soul,\" a term I've never known what to do with, because its most convincing practitioners - the Bee-Gees, Michael McDonald, Hall & Oates, Simply Red, George Michael, Taylor Dayne, Lisa Stansfield, Adele - never winked at black people, so black people rarely batted an eyelash. Flaws and all, these are homeowners as opposed to renters. No matter what, though, a kind of gentrification tends to set in, underscoring that black people have often been rendered unnecessary to attempt blackness. Take Billboard's Top 10 songs of 2013: It's mostly nonblack artists strongly identified with black music, for real and for kicks: Robin Thicke, Miley Cyrus, Justin Timberlake, Macklemore and Ryan Lewis, the dude who made \"The Harlem Shake.\"\n\nSometimes all the inexorable mixing leaves me longing for something with roots that no one can rip all the way out. This is to say that when we're talking about black music, we're talking about horns, drums, keyboards and guitars doing the unthinkable together. We're also talking about what the borrowers and collaborators don't want to or can't lift - centuries of weight, of atrocity we've never sufficiently worked through, the blackness you know is beyond theft because it's too real, too rich, too heavy to steal.\n\nBlackness was on the move before my ancestors were legally free to be. It was on the move before my ancestors even knew what they had. It was on the move because white people were moving it. And the white person most frequently identified as its prime mover is Thomas Dartmouth Rice, a New Yorker who performed as T.D. Rice and, in acclaim, was lusted after as \"Daddy\" Rice, \"the negro par excelle nce.\" Rice was a minstrel, which by the 1830s, when his stardom was at its most refulgent, meant he painted his face with burned cork to approximate those of the enslaved black people he was imitating.\n\nIn 1830, Rice was a nobody actor in his early 20s, touring with a theater company in Cincinnati (or Louisville; historians don't know for sure), when, the story goes, he saw a decrepit, possibly disfigured old black man singing while grooming a horse on the property of a white man whose last name was Crow. On went the light bulb. Rice took in the tune and the movements but failed, it seems, to take down the old man's name. So in his song based on the horse groomer, he renamed him: \"Weel about and turn about jus so/Ebery time I weel about, I jump Jim Crow .\" And just like that, Rice had invented the fellow who would become the mascot for two centuries of legalized racism.\n\nThat night, Rice made himself up to look like the old black man - or something like him, because Rice's get-up most likely concocted skin blacker than any actual black person's and a gibberish dialect meant to imply black speech. Rice had turned the old man's melody and hobbled movements into a song-and-dance routine that no white audience had ever experienced before. What they saw caused a permanent sensation. He reportedly won 20 encores.\n\nRice repeated the act again, night after night, for audiences so profoundly rocked that he was frequently mobbed during performances. Across the Ohio River, not an arduous distance from all that adulation, was Boone County, Ky., whose population would have been largely enslaved Africans. As they were being worked, sometimes to death, white people, desperate with anticipation, were paying to see them depicted at play.\n\n[ To get updates on The 1619 Project, and for more on race from The New York Times, sign up f or our weekly Race/Related newsletter .]\n\nOther performers came and conquered, particularly the Virginia Minstrels , who exploded in 1843, burned brightly then burned out after only months. In their wake, P.T. Barnum made a habit of booking other troupes for his American Museum; when he was short on performers, he blacked up himself. By the 1840s, minstrel acts were taking over concert halls, doing wildly clamored-for residencies in Boston, New York and Philadelphia.\n\nA blackface minstrel would sing, dance, play music, give speeches and cut up for white audiences, almost exclusively in the North, at least initially. Blackface was used for mock operas and political monologues (they called them stump speeches), skits, gender parodies and dances. Before the minstrel show gave it a reliable home, blackface was the entertainment between acts of conventional plays. Its stars were the Elvis, the Beatles, the 'NSync of the 19th century. The performers were beloved and so, especially, were their songs.\n\nDuring minstrelsy's heyday, white songwriters like Stephen Foster wrote the tunes that minstrels sang, tunes we continue to sing. Edwin Pearce Christy's group the Christy Minstrels formed a band - banjo, fiddle, bone castanets, tambourine - that would lay the groundwork for American popular music, from bluegrass to Motown. Some of these instruments had come from Africa; on a plantation, the banjo's body would have been a desiccated gourd. In \"Doo-Dah!\" his book on Foster's work and life, Ken Emerson writes that the fiddle and banjo were paired for the melody, while the bones \"chattered\" and the tambourine \"thumped and jingled a beat that is still heard 'round the world.\"\n\nBut the sounds made with these instruments could be only imagined as black, because the first wave of minstrels were Northerners who'd never been meaningfully South. They played Irish melodies and used Western choral harmonies, not the proto-gospel call-and-response music that would make life on a plantation that much more bearable. Black artists were on the scene, like the pioneer bandleader Frank Johnson and the borderline-mythical Old Corn Meal , who started as a street vendor and wound up the first black man to perform, as himself, on a white New Orleans stage. His stuff was copied by George Nichols, who took up blackface after a start in plain-old clowning. Yet as often as not, blackface minstrelsy tethered black people and black life to white musical structures, like the polka, which was having a moment in 1848. The mixing was already well underway: Europe plus slavery plus the circus, times harmony, comedy and drama, equals Americana.\n\nAnd the muses for so many of the songs were enslaved Americans, people the songwriters had never met, whose enslavement they rarely opposed and instead sentimentalized. Foster's minstrel-show staple \"Old Uncle Ned,\" for instance, warmly if disrespectfully eulogizes the enslaved the way you might a salaried worker or an uncle:\n\nDen lay down de shubble and de hoe, Hang up de fiddle and de bow: No more hard work for poor Old Ned - He's gone whar de good Niggas go, No more hard work for poor Old Ned - He's gone whar de good Niggas go.\n\nSuch an affectionate showcase for poor old (enslaved, soon-to-be-dead) Uncle Ned was as essential as \"air,\" in the white critic Bayard Taylor's 1850 assessment ; songs like this were the \"true expressions of the more popular side of the national character,\" a force that follows \"the American in all its emigrations, colonizations and conquests, as certainly as the Fourth of July and Thanksgiving Day.\" He's not wrong. Minstrelsy's peak stretched from the 1840s to the 1870s, years when the country was at its most violently and legislatively ambivalent about slavery and Negroes; years that included the Civil War and Reconstruction, the ferocious rhetorical ascent of Frederick Douglass, John Brown's botched instigation of a black insurrection at Harpers Ferry and the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.\n\nMinstrelsy's ascent also coincided with the publication, in 1852, of \"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" a polarizing landmark that minstrels adapted for the stage, arguing for and, in simply remaining faithful to Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel, against slavery. These adaptations, known as U.T.C.s, took over the art form until the end of the Civil War. Perhaps minstrelsy's popularity could be (generously) read as the urge to escape a reckoning. But a good time predicated upon the presentation of other humans as stupid, docile, dangerous with lust and enamored of their bondage? It was an escape into slavery's fun house.\n\nWhat blackface minstrelsy gave the country during this period was an entertainment of skill, ribaldry and polemics. But it also lent racism a stage upon which existential fear could become jubilation, contempt could become fantasy. Paradoxically, its dehumanizing bent let white audiences feel more human. They could experience loathing as desire, contempt as adoration, repulsion as lust. They could weep for overworked Uncle Ned as surely as they could ignore his lashed back or his body as it swung from a tree.\n\nBut where did this leave a black performer? If blackface was the country's cultural juggernaut, who would pay Negroes money to perform as themselves? When they were hired, it was only in a pinch. Once, P.T. Barnum needed a replacement for John Diamond, his star white minstrel. In a New York City dance hall, Barnum found a boy, who, it was reported at the time, could outdo Diamond (and Diamond was good ). The boy, of course, was genuinely black. And his being actually black would have rendered him an outrageous blight on a white consumer's narrow presumptions. As Thomas Low Nichols would write in his 1864 compendium, \"Forty Years of American Life,\" \"There was not an audience in America that would not have resented, in a very energetic fashion, the insult of being asked to look at the dancing of a real negro.\" So Barnum \"greased the little 'nigger's' face and rubbed it over with a new blacking of burned cork, painted his thick lips vermilion, put on a woolly wig over his tight curled locks and brought him out as 'the champion nigger-dancer of the world.' \" This child might have been William Henry Lane, whose stage name was Juba . And, as Juba, Lane was persuasive enough that Barnum could pass him off as a white person in blackface. He ceased being a real black boy in order to become Barnum's minstrel Pinocchio.\n\nAfter the Civil War, black performers had taken up minstrelsy, too, corking themselves, for both white and black audiences - with a straight face or a wink, depending on who was looking. Black troupes invented important new dances with blue-ribbon names (the buck-and-wing, the Virginia essence , the stop-time). But these were unhappy innovations. Custom obligated black performers to fulfill an audience's expectations, expectations that white performers had established. A black minstrel was impersonating the impersonation of himself. Think, for a moment, about the talent required to pull that off. According to Henry T. Sampson's book, \"Blacks in Blackface,\" there were no sets or effects, so the black blackface minstrel show was \"a developer of ability because the artist was placed on his own.\" How's that for being twice as good? Yet that no-frills excellence could curdle into an entirely other, utterly degrading double consciousness, one that predates, predicts and probably informs W.E.B. DuBois's more self-consciously dignified rendering .\n\nAmerican popular culture was doomed to cycles not only of questioned ownership, challenged authenticity, dubious propriety and legitimate cultural self-preservation but also to the prison of black respectability, which, with brutal irony, could itself entail a kind of appropriation. It meant comportment in a manner that seemed less black and more white. It meant the appearance of refinement and polish. It meant the cognitive dissonance of, say, Nat King Cole's being very black and sounding - to white America, anyway, with his frictionless baritone and diction as crisp as a hospital corner - suitably white. He was perfect for radio, yet when he got a TV show of his own , it was abruptly canceled, his brown skin being too much for even the black and white of a 1955 television set. There was, perhaps, not a white audience in America, particularly in the South, that would not have resented, in a very energetic fashion, the insult of being asked to look at the majestic singing of a real Negro.\n\nThe modern conundrum of the black performer's seeming respectable, among black people, began, in part, as a problem of white blackface minstrels' disrespectful blackness. Frederick Douglass wrote that they were \"the filthy scum of white society.\" It's that scum that's given us pause over everybody from Bert Williams and Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson to Flavor Flav and Kanye West. Is their blackness an act? Is the act under white control? Just this year, Harold E. Doley Jr., an affluent black Republican in his 70s, was quoted in The Times lamenting West and his alignment with Donald Trump as a \"bad and embarrassing minstrel show\" that \"served to only drive black people away from the G.O.P.\"\n\nBut it's from that scum that a robust, post-minstrel black American theater sprung as a new, black audience hungered for actual, uncorked black people. Without that scum, I'm not sure we get an event as shatteringly epochal as the reign of Motown Records. Motown was a full-scale integration of Western, classical orchestral ideas (strings, horns, woodwinds) with the instincts of both the black church (rhythm sections, gospel harmonies, hand claps) and juke joint Saturday nights (rhythm sections, guitars, vigor). Pure yet \"noisy.\" Black men in Armani. Black women in ball gowns. Stables of black writers, producers and musicians. Backup singers solving social equations with geometric choreography. And just in time for the hegemony of the American teenager.\n\nEven now it feels like an assault on the music made a hundred years before it. Motown specialized in love songs. But its stars, those songs and their performance of them were declarations of war on the insults of the past and present. The scratchy piccolo at the start of a Four Tops hit was, in its way, a raised fist. Respectability wasn't a problem with Motown; respectability was its point. How radically optimistic a feat of antiminstrelsy, for it's as glamorous a blackness as this country has ever mass-produced and devoured.\n\nThe proliferation of black music across the planet - the proliferation, in so many senses, of being black - constitutes a magnificent joke on American racism. It also confirms the attraction that someone like Rice had to that black man grooming the horse. But something about that desire warps and perverts its source, lampoons and cheapens it even in adoration. Loving black culture has never meant loving black people, too. Loving black culture risks loving the life out of it.\n\nAnd yet doesn't that attraction make sense? This is the music of a people who have survived, who not only won't stop but also can't be stopped. Music by a people whose major innovations - jazz, funk, hip-hop - have been about progress, about the future, about getting as far away from nostalgia as time will allow, music that's thought deeply about the allure of outer space and robotics, music whose promise and possibility, whose rawness, humor and carnality call out to everybody - to other black people, to kids in working class England and middle-class Indonesia. If freedom's ringing, who on Earth wouldn't also want to rock the bell?\n\nIn 1845, J.K. Kennard, a critic for the newspaper The Knickerbocker, hyperventilated about the blackening of America. Except he was talking about blackface minstrels doing the blackening. Nonetheless, Kennard could see things for what they were:\n\n\"Who are our true rulers? The negro poets, to be sure! Do they not set the fashion, and give laws to the public taste? Let one of them, in the swamps of Carolina, compose a new song, and it no sooner reaches the ear of a white amateur, than it is written down, amended, (that is, almost spoilt,) printed, and then put upon a course of rapid dissemination, to cease only with the utmost bounds of Anglo-Saxondom, perhaps of the world.\"\n\nWhat a panicked clairvoyant! The fear of black culture - or \"black culture\" - was more than a fear of black people themselves. It was an anxiety over white obsolescence. Kennard's anxiety over black influence sounds as ambivalent as Lorde's, when, all the way from her native New Zealand, she tsk-ed rap culture's extravagance on \"Royals,\" her hit from 2013, while recognizing, both in the song's hip-hop production and its appetite for a particular sort of blackness, that maybe she's too far gone:\n\nEvery song's like gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair\n\nBeneath Kennard's warnings must have lurked an awareness that his white brethren had already fallen under this spell of blackness, that nothing would stop its spread to teenage girls in 21st-century Auckland, that the men who \"infest our promenades and our concert halls like a colony of beetles\" (as a contemporary of Kennard's put it) weren't black people at all but white people just like him - beetles and, eventually, Beatles. Our first most original art form arose from our original sin, and some white people have always been worried that the primacy of black music would be a kind of karmic punishment for that sin. The work has been to free this country from paranoia's bondage, to truly embrace the amplitude of integration. I don't know how we're doing.\n\nLast spring, \"Old Town Road,\" a silly, drowsy ditty by the Atlanta songwriter Lil Nas X, was essentially banished from country radio. Lil Nas sounds black, as does the trap beat he's droning over. But there's definitely a twang to him that goes with the opening bars of faint banjo and Lil Nas's lil' cowboy fantasy. The song snowballed into a phenomenon . All kinds of people - cops, soldiers, dozens of dapper black promgoers - posted dances to it on YouTube and TikTok. Then a crazy thing happened. It charted - not just on Billboard's Hot 100 singles chart, either. In April, it showed up on both its Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and its Hot Country Songs chart. A first. And, for now at least, a last.\n\nThe gatekeepers of country radio refused to play the song ; they didn't explain why. Then, Billboard determined that the song failed to \"embrace enough elements of today's country music to chart in its current version.\" This doesn't warrant translation, but let's be thorough, anyway: The song is too black for certain white people.\n\nBut by that point it had already captured the nation's imagination and tapped into the confused thrill of integrated culture. A black kid hadn't really merged white music with black, he'd just taken up the American birthright of cultural synthesis. The mixing feels historical. Here, for instance, in the song's sample of a Nine Inch Nails track is a banjo, the musical spine of the minstrel era. Perhaps Lil Nas was too American. Other artists of the genre seemed to sense this. White singers recorded pretty tributes in support, and one, Billy Ray Cyrus, performed his on a remix with Lil Nas X himself.\n\nThe newer version lays Cyrus's casual grit alongside Lil Nas's lackadaisical wonder. It's been No.1 on Billboard's all-genre Hot 100 singles chart since April, setting a record. And the bottomless glee over the whole thing makes me laugh, too - not in a surprised, yacht-rock way but as proof of what a fine mess this place is. One person's sign of progress remains another's symbol of encroachment. Screw the history. Get off my land.\n\nFour hundred years ago, more than 20 kidnapped Africans arrived in Virginia. They were put to work and put through hell. Twenty became millions, and some of those people found - somehow - deliverance in the power of music. Lil Nas X has descended from those millions and appears to be a believer in deliverance. The verses of his song flirt with Western kitsch, what young black internetters branded, with adorable idiosyncrasy and a deep sense of history, the \" yee-haw agenda.\" But once the song reaches its chorus (\"I'm gonna take my horse to the Old Town Road, and ride til I can't no more\"), I don't hear a kid in an outfit. I hear a cry of ancestry. He's a westward-bound refugee; he's an Exoduster . And Cyrus is down for the ride. Musically, they both know: This land is their land.\n\nWesley Morris is a staff writer for the magazine, a critic at large for The New York Times and a co-host of the podcast \"Still Processing.\" He was awarded the 2012 Pulitzer Prize for criticism.

      "text": "For Future Generations, It's Time to Reflect on Black Art\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nShifts in politics, performance and protest have all altered our culture in a way not seen in years.\n\nBy Eric V. Copage\n\nI grew up in Southern California neighborhoods that were overwhelmingly white - white schools, white teachers, white curriculum. I remember visiting the Los Angeles County Museum of Art where a cast of Auguste Rodin's monumental sculpture of Balzac towered over me. My friends and I immersed ourselves in the works of white authors, and I can still recite vast sections of T.S. Eliot's \"The Hollow Men,\" William Butler Yeats's \"The Second Coming,\" and, if I squeeze my eyes real tight, the final luxurious paragraphs of \"The Dead,\" James Joyce's masterful short story.\n\nBut I am black - African-American, if you will - and unambiguously of African heritage. Thanks to my father, the rhythms and melodies of Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis and John Coltrane flowed through our household during my childhood. Yet, as an adolescent, Led Zeppelin, Cream and the Who were favored by my friends and me. (My enthusiasm for bluesmen such as Sonny Terry, Brownie McGhee, Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters was rooted in my rock 'n' roll fandom.) In short, I felt only incidentally \"black,\" despite being harassed by the local police, who frequently stopped me as I walked home from school or rode my bike to the grocery store.\n\nThat feeling slowly changed, of course, as I became an adult. But I didn't feel I became fully black until the birth of my first child. His arrival brought into focus the usual parental responsibilities of providing food, shelter and moral support. But I also felt a special duty to imbue my son - and later my daughter - with a sense of what it means to be of African heritage in America. Not \"the talk\" about navigating encounters with the police. I felt the need to address meta-questions pertaining to the frame of mind that would help my children prosper in the world, not only survive.\n\nSo, I wrote a cookbook whose recipes from the African diaspora were anchored by stories from the black cooks who contributed them, as well as the wit and wisdom from black cultures around the world and across time. Then came a series of what I call \"affirmative action\" books - collections of pithy proverbs and quotes from prominent historical and contemporary black people meant to inspire the desire to implement concrete positive action.\n\nMore recently, my thoughts turned to internalizing black culture in a more formal way, especially after seeing Jacob Lawrence's \"The Migration Series\" at the Museum of Modern Art in 2015. The 60 small panel paintings illustrating the movement of black Southerners to the North had affected me tremendously. The formal beauty of the work and the message of black agency felt like an oasis of pride and inspiration in a world of stop and frisks, police killings of black men and women, and the general denigration of \"black culture.\"\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "See the Black Art Remaking Our Culture\n\nThe Culture Issue\n\nBy Jenna Wortham and Kimberly Drew Oct. 7, 2020\n\nBlack culture is flourishing. Jenna Wortham and Kimberly Drew want to preserve it. Here's what that means.\n\nThis essay and the portfolio below are adapted from \"Black Futures,\" to be published in December by One World, an imprint of Random House.\n\nIn a piece titled \"LTS I,\" the Nigerian-American artist Toyin Ojih Odutola paints her brother in repose, with midnight-colored skin, gold jewelry and piercing eyes, unconcerned by who might be looking at him. The painting is part of \"Like the Sea,\" a series of portraits of her two younger brothers rendered in her signature style, which emphasizes the depths of Black skin by applying layers of color, in this case, black pastels. Ojih Odutola said she gave her subjects the range to \"just be\" and exist \"as they are,\" rather than forcing them into backdrops that might have felt more recognizable, or informed by historical representations of Black people.\n\nOjih Odutola named her series for a passage in Zora Neale Hurston's \"Their Eyes Were Watching God,\" in which the main character, Janie Mae Crawford, reflects that \"love is lak de sea. It's uh movin' thing, but still and all, it takes its shape from de shore it meets, and it's different with every shore.\" Crawford comes to realize that love is as vast as it is mysterious - like Ojih Odutola's practice, which insists on the beauty in seeing ourselves as we are.\n\nWhat Ojih Odutola presciently conveys through her work is that Black representation is almost always limited if we allow ourselves to be crunched into other people's fantasies. In authoring our own images, Black people achieve some sovereignty beyond the reach of colonialist ideas and racist mythologies. Today you can see brilliant examples of this throughout our culture, whether in the plays of Jackie Sibblies Drury, or in the painter Amy Sherald's portraits of Michelle Obama and Breonna Taylor, or in the comedian Jaboukie Young-White's sly wit on Twitter, or even in the satirical takes on politics and public policy from young cultural producers on TikTok.\n\nOnline and off, we are witnessing a flourishing of Black creativity and art. Our Instagram posts, likes and quoted tweets are creating an unparalleled sense of dynamism and interconnectivity, and what is noticed feels more expansive than it has before. It is now possible, for instance, to witness our everyday thoughts and reactions and experiences - a staggering feat considering how little has been historically logged about the lives of Black people, unmediated and from our own perspectives.\n\nIn an essay collected in \"Picturing Us: African-American Identity in Photography,\" Bell Hooks writes about how photography - particularly snapshots of Black people - form \"pictorial genealogies\" that \"could ensure against the losses of the past.\" Hooks describes altars, hallways, credenzas and dressers as the commemorative homes for hallowed Black photos; today those collective memories are aggregated on social platforms. The daily diaries of our experience and the documentation of key moments in modern Black history - including the uprisings in Ferguson, Mo., the Ethiopia-Eritrea peace deal and feminist discussions about the impact of patriarchal violence on rapper Megan Thee Stallion - flow through Twitter, Instagram and TikTok. Our generation's James Browns release their new music not through Republic Records but on Bandcamp.\n\nAnd yet, it is very likely that none of this is being preserved carefully or comprehensively for later review. Social media companies prioritize and monetize Black content, but make no effort to protect it. Ownership for Black people has long been constrained (just think of discriminatory redlining or the dismal number of Fortune 500 companies helmed by Black entrepreneurs), and online it is no different. These platforms encourage quantity over quality and make it increasingly difficult to access past posts. Already some of the most important reservoirs of modern Black culture, including Vine, a short-form video site that predated TikTok, or BlackPlanet, a social-networking site built specifically for Black people, have shuttered or faded from popular use. In some cases, the blogs, photos and clips created and exchanged on social platforms have disappeared from view. A recent update to Myspace, a social site that many Black musicians relied on, lost a trove of data some estimated to be as large as 53 million songs.\n\nOnline, there exists an inherent tension between remembering and forgetting that is particularly tormented, given how little agency we have over how information and memories are stored. Right now it is possible to download archives from Facebook, Instagram or Twitter for future reference, but it's hard to imagine that anyone is doing so with regularity. With social platforms, there is newly shared culture, and in effect, shared history, but it is one that is vulnerable to a loss as arbitrary as a server migration or company sale. Scholars like Meredith Clark at the University of Virginia and projects like Documenting the Now study how Black people use social media, but those efforts alone are not enough to capture the monumental flow of content.\n\nTen years ago, the Library of Congress announced plans to archive every single public tweet. The institution describes Twitter as \"one of this generation's most significant legacies\" for capturing \"this rich period in our history, the information flows and social and political forces that help define the current generation.\" But in 2017, librarians were forced to abandon their efforts. The sheer volume of tweets - numbering in the high billions - and the multitude of formats shared on the platform (photos, videos, GIFs) made it impossible to archive and organize the catalog of data in a legible way. The Library of Congress has said it will continue to selectively save tweets around major events, like elections, and subjects, like public policy, but its challenges only highlight the urgency for more nuanced and creative approaches to archives.\n\nIn 2015, we set out to create our own analog archive of contemporary Black life by Black people and for Black people. This project eventually became the book \"Black Futures,\" from which this portfolio is drawn. The ephemerality of social media terrified us, and as such, inspired us. We also wanted to acknowledge and assemble the multifaceted tiers of dialogues happening among activists, artists, academics, performers and athletes about Black life today. Generations before us had collections like Toni Morrison's \"The Black Book\" (1974); Akasha Gloria Hull, Patricia Bell-Scott, and Barbara Smith's \"All the Women Are White, All the Blacks Are Men, But Some of Us Are Brave\" (1982); and countless other texts, and similarly, we wanted to create a book that could serve as a guide to this unprecedented moment of connectivity and production to ensure that it would not be lost in the annals of history.\n\nWe set out on this project with a keen awareness that all archives are incomplete because they rely on the priorities and preferences of the authors and collectors. We called on the wisdom of Saidiya Hartman, a professor of English and comparative literature at Columbia University, who writes in her preliminary note to \"Wayward Lives, Beautiful Experiments\" that \"every historian of the multitude, the dispossessed, the subaltern and the enslaved is forced to grapple with the power and authority of the archive and the limits it sets on what can be known, whose perspective matters and who is endowed with the gravity and authority of historical actor.\" One solution, embedded within \"Black Futures,\" is encouraging our readers to see the book as an invitation to document our present as they see fit, too.\n\nRight now, many of us are actively engaged with dismantling the history of the past, exposing it as wrong, perverted. This summer, we watched as people toppled racist monuments into rivers, renamed streets, unearthed pasts that we were told did not matter. The familiar is being made strange and shown to be ripe for revision. You can see this in the work of Amanda Williams, for example. Williams repaints empty houses on the South Side of Chicago using a palette based on products historically marketed to Black people. They include Crown Royal bag purple, Luster's Pink Oil Moisturizer pink, Ultra Sheen blue. Williams's houses transform an otherwise bleak landscape into something rich and brilliant, and simultaneously raise an eyebrow at how colors are tethered to notions of race and class. Sarah Lewis, who teaches art history, architecture and African and African-American studies at Harvard, uses her \"Vision & Justice Project,\" which includes a multifaceted curriculum and print publication, to decenter whiteness in academia and scholarship. In describing the project, Lewis urges \"speaking faith over the future\" to sharpen our visual literacy as we do the work of looking back to better understand where we are headed.\n\nThe cultural landscape is a metaphorical sundown town - welcoming us conditionally and refusing us methodically, violently and consistently. In June 2015, in an article for The New Yorker, Edwidge Danticat wrote about Black people that \"we have always traveled from place to place looking for better opportunities, where they exist. We are not always welcomed, especially if we are viewed as different and dangerous. ... Will we ever have a home in this place, or will we always be set adrift from the home we knew? Or the home we have never known.\" \"Black Futures\" is meant to be a dwelling place for our most precious cultural exports in a moment in which so much of our work is still subject to erasure. It wasn't enough to define ourselves by our examples of productivity; we also wanted to go further and invite each contributor to delve into what it meant to be alive.\n\nThe book is not an answer, but a series of prompts and questions, including what it would mean for everyone to create their own \"Black Futures\" project. We know that one book can't begin to capture everything about Black life, but we also know that too much has already been lost.

A New Doc Tells Its Story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\n\"Mr. Soul!\" spotlights Ellis Haizlip, the host of a show that gave Stevie Wonder, Wilson Pickett and James Baldwin a platform.\n\nBy Jim Farber\n\nAnyone analyzing the image of African-Americans on the narrow range of TV stations available in the United States 50 years ago could expect to see one of just two stark portrayals. \"We were either victims or villains,\" said Chester Higgins, a veteran photographer whose portraits of Black America helped widen that perspective. \"The media focused on poverty, riots and crime. They chose not to give any presence to the full character of our people.\"\n\nThat's the dehumanizing image the show emphatically titled \"Soul!\" aimed to obliterate. Debuting on New York City's Public Television station WNET (then WNDT) on Sept. 12, 1968, with Higgins as its chief photographer, \"Soul!\" presented \"the vitality and creativity of Black America in a way no other program ever had,\" said Felipe Luciano, the poet, activist and broadcaster who worked on its production team. \"'Soul!' gave viewers the first genuine sense of the expansiveness of Black culture.\"\n\nNona Hendryx, who shared an ecstatic performance with Patti LaBelle and the Bluebelles on the show's inaugural episode, said, \"For me, 'Soul!' was must-see TV.\" She added: \"Being on the show gave you credibility.\"\n\nThe show was largely shaped by its co-producer and host, Ellis Haizlip, a Black gay man operating with power and confidence at a homophobic time. Haizlip used his refined taste, eccentric character and outsider's perspective both to guide the show's aesthetic and to define its goals. Now, half a century after its debut, a new documentary named \"Mr. Soul!\" is arriving, with a focus on the inexorable link between the program and its host.\n\n\"It was Ellis's revolutionary idea to combine politics, poetry, music and fiction into one forum,\" said Melissa Haizlip, the host's cousin, who directed the film, which arrives on Friday via movie theaters' video-on-demand services .\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "Don't Be Like That\n\nIt was just after eight o'clock on a November night when Robert McCulloch, the prosecuting attorney for St. Louis County, announced that a grand jury would not be returning an indictment in the police killing of Michael Brown, who was eighteen, unarmed, and African-American. About an hour later and eight hundred miles away, President Obama delivered a short and sober speech designed to function as an anti-inflammatory. He praised police officers while urging them to \"show care and restraint\" when confronting protesters. He said that \"communities of color\" had \"real issues\" with law enforcement, but reminded disappointed Missourians that Brown's mother and father had asked for peace. \"Michael Brown's parents have lost more than anyone,\" he said. \"We should be honoring their wishes.\"\n\nEven as he mentioned Brown's parents, Obama was careful not to invoke Brown himself, who had become a polarizing figure. To the protesters who chanted, \"Hands up! Don't shoot!,\" Brown was a symbol of the young African-American man as victim-the chant referred to the claim that Brown was surrendering, with his hands up, when he was killed. Critics of the protest movement were more likely to bring up the video, taken in the fifteen minutes before Brown's death, that appeared to show him stealing cigarillos from a convenience store and then shoving and intimidating the worker who tried to stop him-the victim was also, it seemed, a perpetrator.\n\nAfter the Times described Brown as \"no angel,\" the MSNBC host Melissa Harris-Perry accused the newspaper of \"victim-blaming,\" arguing that African-Americans, no matter how \"angelic,\" will never be safe from \"those who see their very skin as a sin.\" But, on the National Review Web site, Heather MacDonald quoted an anonymous black corporate executive who told her, \"Michael Brown may have been shot by the cop, but he was killed by parents and a community that produced such a thug.\" And so the Michael Brown debate became a proxy for our ongoing argument about race: where some seek to expose what America is doing to black communities, others insist that the real problem is what black communities are doing to themselves.\n\nSociologists who study black America have a name for these camps: those who emphasize the role of institutional racism and economic circumstances are known as structuralists, while those who emphasize the importance of self-perpetuating norms and behaviors are known as culturalists. Mainstream politicians are culturalists by nature, because in America you seldom lose an election by talking up the virtues of hard work and good conduct. But in many sociology departments structuralism holds sway-no one who studies African-American communities wants to be accused, as the Times was, of \"victim-blaming.\" Orlando Patterson, a Jamaica-born sociologist at Harvard with an appetite for intellectual combat, wants to redeem the culturalist tradition, thereby redeeming sociology itself. In a manifesto published in December, in the Chronicle of Higher Education , he argued that \"fearful\" sociologists had abandoned \"studies of the cultural dimensions of poverty, particularly black poverty,\" and that the discipline had become \"largely irrelevant.\" Now Patterson and Ethan Fosse, a Harvard doctoral student in sociology, are publishing an ambitious new anthology called \"The Cultural Matrix: Understanding Black Youth\" (Harvard), which is meant to show that the culturalist tradition still has something to teach us.\n\nThe book arrives on the fiftieth anniversary of its most important predecessor: a slim government report written by an Assistant Secretary of Labor and first printed in an edition of a hundred. The author was Daniel Patrick Moynihan, and the title was \"The Negro Family: The Case for National Action.\" At first, the historian James T. Patterson has written, only one copy was allowed to circulate; the other ninety-nine were locked in a vault. Moynihan's report cited sociologists and government surveys to underscore a message meant to startle: the Negro community was doing badly, and its condition was probably \"getting worse, not better.\" Moynihan, who was trained in sociology, judged that \"most Negro youth are in danger of being caught up in the tangle of pathology that affects their world, and probably a majority are so entrapped.\" He returned again and again to his main theme, \"the deterioration of the Negro family,\" which he considered \"the fundamental source of the weakness of the Negro community\"; he included a chart showing the rising proportion of nonwhite births in America that were \"illegitimate.\" (The report used the terms \"Negro\" and \"nonwhite\" interchangeably.) And, at the end, Moynihan called-briefly, and vaguely-for a national program to \"strengthen the Negro family.\"\n\nThe 1965 report was leaked to the press, inspiring a series of lurid articles, and later that year the Johnson Administration released the entire document, making it available for forty-five cents. Moynihan found some allies, including Martin Luther King, Jr. In a speech in October, King referred to an unnamed \"recent study\" showing that \"the Negro family in the urban ghettos is crumbling and disintegrating.\" But King also worried that some people might attribute this \"social catastrophe\" to \"innate Negro weaknesses,\" and that discussions of it could be \"used to justify neglect and rationalize oppression.\" Many sociologists were harsher. Andrew Billingsley argued that in assessing the problems caused by dysfunctional black families Moynihan had mistaken the symptom for the sickness. \"The family is a creature of society,\" he wrote. \"And the greatest problems facing black families are problems which emanate from the white racist, militarist, materialistic society which places higher priority on putting white men on the moon than putting black men on their feet on this earth.\" This debate had influence far beyond sociological journals: when Harris-Perry accused the Times of \"victim-blaming,\" she was using a term coined by the psychologist William Ryan, in a book-length rebuttal to the Moynihan report, \"Blaming the Victim.\"\n\nOrlando Patterson thinks that, half a century later, it's easier to appreciate all that Moynihan got right. \"History has been kind to Moynihan,\" he and Fosse write, which might be another way of saying that history has not been particularly kind to the people Moynihan wrote about-some of his dire predictions no longer seem so outlandish. Moynihan despaired that the illegitimacy rate for Negro babies was approaching twenty-five per cent. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the equivalent rate in 2013 was 71.5 per cent. (The rate for non-Hispanic white babies was 29.3 per cent.) Even so, Patterson and the other contributors avoid pronouncing upon \"ghetto culture\" or \"the culture of poverty,\" or even \"black culture.\" Instead, the authors see shifting patterns of belief and behavior that may nevertheless combine to make certain families less stable, or certain young people less employable. The hope is that, by paying close attention to culture, sociologists will be better equipped to identify these patterns, and help change them.\n\nIn Moynihan's view, the triumph of the civil-rights movement made his report that much more exigent: he was sure that as long as the Negro family was unstable the movement's promises of economic advancement and social equality would remain unfulfilled. Of course, alarming reports about the state of black culture have a long history in America: sometimes the accounts of deviant behavior were meant to explain why black oppression was justified; at other times, the accounts were meant to explain why black oppression was harmful.\n\nIn 1899, the trailblazing Negro scholar W. E. B. Du Bois drew on interviews and census data to produce \"The Philadelphia Negro: A Social Study,\" which helped shape the young discipline of sociology. Du Bois spent a year living in the neighborhood he wrote about, amid what he later described as \"an atmosphere of dirt, drunkenness, poverty, and crime.\" What emerged from this field research was a stern, unsentimental book; at times, Du Bois's disdain for his subjects, especially what he called \"the dregs,\" seemed as great as his outrage at the discrimination they faced. He observed, in language much harsher than Moynihan's, the large number of unmarried mothers, many of whom he characterized as \"ignorant and loose.\" In this book, as in the rest of his life, Du Bois did not shy away from prescription. He concluded by reminding whites of their duty to stop employment discrimination, which he called \"morally wrong, politically dangerous, industrially wasteful, and socially silly.\" But he reminded Negro readers that they had a duty, too: to work harder, to behave better, and to stem the tide of \"Negro crime,\" which was, he said, \"a menace to a civilized people.\" His chapter on \"The Negro Criminal,\" illustrated with charts and graphs, showed that Negroes were disproportionately represented in police records-though he suggested that the police, too, were acting disproportionately.\n\nLink copied\n\nIn the years before Moynihan, other social scientists refined Du Bois's approach, most famously Oscar Lewis, who used the term \"culture of poverty\" to describe what he saw among the Mexican families he studied. In retrospect, it seems clear that what infuriated many of Moynihan's readers wasn't so much what he wrote (he was mainly summarizing contemporary research) as what he represented. He was a young white political staffer explaining what was wrong with black communities, so he had to be wrong, even if he was right. One of the most revealing and representative responses came from James Farmer, the director of the Congress of Racial Equality: \"We are sick unto death of being analyzed, mesmerized, bought, sold, and slobbered over, while the same evils that are the ingredients of our oppression go unattended.\" Moynihan had stumbled into a quandary familiar to sociologists: sometimes your subject doesn't want to be subjectified.\n\nThe battle over Moynihan's report was a battle over the legacy of slavery, too, and Orlando Patterson was well qualified to join it. He earned his Ph.D. in 1965, with a dissertation on the sociology of Jamaican slavery, and in his best-known books, \"Slavery and Social Death\" and \"Freedom in the Making of Western Culture,\" he broadened his focus to consider the institution of slavery and how it gave rise to the ideal of freedom. (He has also published a trio of novels set in Jamaica.) In 1973, as the anti-Moynihan wave was cresting, Patterson offered a partial defense: rebutting Ryan's rebuttal, he wrote that writers like Moynihan \"in no way blame the victim.\" In fact, Patterson argued, Moynihan's report was overly \"deterministic,\" portraying black Americans as the inevitable victims of a long and oppressive history. Even more than Du Bois, Moynihan stressed the debilitating legacy of American slavery, asserting that it was \"indescribably worse\" than any form of bondage in the history of the world. Although Moynihan's fiercest critics didn't dispute this, they found themselves arguing that slavery had been less destructive than Moynihan thought: they celebrated the resilience of the black family in its non-standard forms. (Moynihan's \"illegitimacy\" statistics couldn't account for the grandparents and other extended-family members who might help a mother bring up her child.) Patterson called these scholars \"survivalists,\" in contrast to \"catastrophists,\" and years later the survivalists' work can seem too transparent in its aims. A number of sociologists, wary of insulting their subjects, seemed content to settle for flattery instead, depicting the black family as an extraordinary success story, no matter what the statistics said.\n\nPatterson sometimes implies that the Moynihan affair chastened sociology forever, but the culturalist impulse didn't go away. In 1978, William Julius Wilson popularized the term \"underclass,\" to describe the non-working poor who have been left behind by the disappearance of blue-collar jobs, but he also came to believe that \"social isolation\" helps create ways of living that perpetuate poverty. (Wilson argued that declining professional prospects made some black men less marriageable. Patterson thinks that declining marriage rates had more to do with the increased availability of contraception and abortion, which eroded cultural norms that had once compelled men to marry the women they impregnated.) And in 1999, on the hundredth anniversary of Du Bois's classic, Elijah Anderson published a new sociological study of poor black neighborhoods in Philadelphia, \"Code of the Street,\" which took seriously its informants' own characterization of themselves and their neighbors as either \"decent\" or \"street\" or, not infrequently, a bit of both. In \"The Cultural Matrix,\" Patterson updates and expands Anderson's taxonomy, listing \"three main social groups\" (the middle class, the working class, and \"disconnected street people\") that are common in \"disadvantaged\" African-American neighborhoods, along with \"four focal cultural configurations\" (adapted mainstream, proletarian, street, and hip-hop). In general, though, \"black youth\" means \"poor black youth,\" since poverty is what gives a project such as this one its urgency.\n\nThe contributors to \"The Cultural Matrix\" strive to avoid technical language, in what seems to be a brave but doomed attempt to attract casual readers to a book that is nearly seven hundred pages long. Some of the best cultural sociology draws its power from careful interviewing and observation. Anderson's \"Code of the Street\" was influential because it was widely read, and it was widely read because it often resembled a novel, full of complicated people and pungent testimonials. (One \"decent\" woman's account of raising five children had a nine-word opening sentence that no writing workshop could have improved: \"My son that's bad now-his name is Curtis.\") Some of Patterson's contributors have a similar facility with anecdote. A chapter about resisting the influence of poor neighborhoods includes a startling detail about a tough but crime-averse young man named Gary: \"He pats people down before they get in his car to make sure they are not carrying anything that could get him arrested.\" This, apparently, is what staying out of trouble might entail for a young black man in Baltimore.\n\nAmong the most important essays in the new anthology is Jody Miller's account of sexual relationships in St. Louis. An eighteen-year-old informant named Terence talks about participating in a sexual encounter that may not have been consensual, and his affectless language only makes the scene more discomfiting:\n\nI NTERVIEWER : Did you know the girl?\n\nT ERENCE : Naw, I ain't know her, know her like for real know her. But I knew her name or whatever. I had seen her before. That was it though.\n\nI NTERVIEWER : So when you all got there, she was in the room already?\n\nTERENCE : Naw, when we got there, she hadn't even got there yet. And when she came, she went in the room with my friend, the one she had already knew. And then after they was in there for a minute, he came out and let us know that she was gon', you know, run a train or whatever. So after that, we just went one by one.\n\nMiller knows that most readers will find this appalling, so she follows Terence's testimony with an assurance that incidents such as these reflect a legacy of racism-she mentions, for instance, \"the gross 'scientific' objectification of African women in the nineteenth century.\" This is a common technique among the new culturalists: every distressing contemporary phenomenon must be matched to an explicitly racist antecedent, however distant. This distance is what separates the culturalists from the structuralists. Patterson and the others are right that cultural traits often outgrow and outlive the circumstances of their creation. But often what remains is a circular explanation, description masquerading as a causal account. African-American gender relations are troubled because of \"cultural features\" that foster troubled gender relations.\n\nOne difference between the current era and Moynihan's, or Du Bois's, is that contemporary sociologists have a new potential culprit to blame for the disorder they see: hip-hop. The anthology includes a careful history of the genre by Wayne Marshall, an ethnomusicologist, who emphasizes its mutability. But Patterson, brave as ever, can't resist wading into this culture war. In one exuberant passage, he compares MC Hammer to Nietzsche, uses an obscure remix verse to contend that hip-hop routinely celebrates \"forced abortions,\" and pronounces Lil Wayne \"irredeemably vulgar\" and \"all too typical\" of the genre's devolution. And yet he is a conscientious enough social scientist to concede that there doesn't seem to be decisive evidence for a \"causal link\" between violent lyrics and violent behavior. Writing in 1999, Anderson mentioned hip-hop only in passing, suggesting that it supported, and was supported by, \"an ideology of alienation.\" (He was nearly as critical of \"popular love songs\" and \"television soap operas,\" which he judged to nourish girls' dreams of storybook romance. \"When a girl is approached by a boy,\" he wrote, \"her faith in the dream clouds her view of the situation.\") Now hip-hop has achieved cultural hegemony, but Patterson doesn't seem to have noticed that the genre has become markedly less pugnacious in recent years, thanks to non-thuggish stars like Drake, Nicki Minaj, Macklemore, Kendrick Lamar, and Iggy Azalea. The next wave of culturalist analyses will surely be able to explain how this music, too, is part of the problem.\n\nThe most provocative chapter in \"The Cultural Matrix\" is the final one, an exacting polemic by a Harvard colleague of Patterson's, Tommie Shelby, a professor of African and African-American studies and of philosophy. Shelby accepts, for the sake of argument, the idea that \"suboptimal cultural traits\" are the major impediment for many African-Americans seeking to escape poverty. He notes, in language much more delicate than Moynihan's (let alone Du Bois's), that \"some in ghetto communities are believed to devalue traditional coparenting and to eschew mainstream styles of childrearing.\" Still, Shelby is suspicious of attempts to reform these traits, and not only because he is wary of \"victim-blaming.\" He thinks that the \"ghetto poor\" have a right to remain defiantly unaltered. In his view, a program of compulsory cultural reform \"robs the ghetto poor of a choice that should be theirs alone-namely, whether the improved prospects for ending or ameliorating ghetto poverty are worth the loss of moral pride they would incur by conceding the insulting view that they have not shown themselves to be deserving of better treatment.\" For Shelby, opposing hypothetical future government programs is also a way of registering frustration with past government action, and inaction. \"Given its failure to secure just social conditions,\" he writes, \"the state lacks the moral standing to act as an agent of moral reform.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nThis \"moral standing\" argument is too powerful for its own good, because it would invalidate just about everything done by the U.S. government, or any other. The crucial question is not whether the state has the \"moral standing\" to reform cultural practices in the ghetto but whether it has the ability. Politicians love to call for such reform; Obama could have been channelling Moynihan when he said, in his famous 2008 speech on race, that African-Americans needed to take more responsibility for their own communities by \"demanding more from our fathers.\" But a demand is not a program. Patterson, in the essay for the Chronicle , suggested that \"cultural values, norms, beliefs, and habitual practices may be easier to change than structural ones.\" And yet a chapter in the anthology, about a federal relationship-counselling program called Building Strong Families, provides less reason for confidence. In most cases, the follow-up reports suggested that the program had little or no effect on the relationships it sought to help; in one city, Baltimore, couples who received counselling were markedly more likely to split. (The authors, looking for good news, voice a faint hope that the demise of those relationships \"may lead to better repartnering outcomes.\")\n\nA few years ago, in The Nation , Patterson responded to some disappointing statistics showing high unemployment and persistent segregation by urging African-Americans to \"do some serious soul-searching.\" But part of the problem with calls for cultural reform is that the so-called \"ghetto poor\" tend to agree with the kinds of messages that outsiders, whether tough-love politicians or self-conscious sociologists alike, would urge upon them: work matters, family matters, culture matters. Ethan Fosse draws on a number of recent surveys of the \"disconnected\"-the term refers to young people who are neither employed nor attending school-and finds that they adhere more strongly to various mainstream cultural values than their connected counterparts do: they are more likely to say that having a good career is \"very important\" to them, and seventy-four per cent of them say that black men \"don't take their education seriously enough,\" compared with only sixty-two per cent of connected black youth. Surveys also suggest that disconnected young people are more likely to agree with Patterson's critique of hip-hop-the people most susceptible to the genre's influence turn out to be the ones most skeptical of it. In an overview chapter, Patterson wryly notes that results such as these may pose a conundrum. \"Sociologists love subjects who tell truth to mainstream power,\" he writes. \"They grow uncomfortable when these subjects tell mainstream truths to sociologists.\" But none of this offers encouragement for people who think that cultural change is a key to social uplift.\n\nJust how dire is the situation? Moynihan worried that \"the Negro community\" was in a state of decline, bedevilled by an increasingly matriarchal family structure, which led to the increasing incidence of crime and delinquency. Much of Moynihan's historical data was scant or inconclusive, but, when it came to violent crime, he guessed correctly: in the fifteen years after he published his report, the country's homicide rate doubled, with blacks overrepresented among both perpetrators and victims. America, and Negro America in particular, was at the beginning of a years-long catastrophe. But what happened next was even more surprising: beginning in the early nineteen-nineties, the homicide rate, like other rates of violent crime, began to decline; today, African-Americans are about half as likely to be involved in a homicide, either as perpetrator or as victim, as they were two decades ago. Patterson and Fosse write that, in the years after Moynihan's report, a \"discrepancy\" developed between the optimistic scholarship of sociologists, eager to emphasize the resilience of black families, and \"the reality of urban black life,\" which was increasingly grim. But the contemporary era has been marked by the opposite discrepancy: even as the new culturalists were resurrecting Moynihan's diagnosis, the scourge of crime was in retreat.\n\nPatterson, committed to his critique of African-American cultural life, can't bring himself to celebrate this news. Hip-hop is important to him because it fuels his suspicion that, despite the drop in crime, black culture is in trouble. Fosse seems to share this pessimism, reporting \"an alarming increase in the percentage of black youth who are structurally disconnected over the past decade.\" He uses survey data to create a fitted curve, showing that \"nearly 25 percent\" of black youth were disconnected in 2012, while the white rate \"has remained below 15 percent.\" (The curve is not included in the book.) In fact, the data suggest that percentages of disconnection among black and white youth have been rising at about the same rate over the past decade; what's most alarming is not the recent increase but the ongoing disparity. Among Patterson, Fosse, and their peers, the tendency to write as if black culture were in exceptional crisis seems to be what a sociologist might call an unexamined injunctive norm: a shared prescriptive rule, one so ingrained that its followers don't even realize it exists.\n\nAnd so the good news on crime gets downplayed. \"By focusing too much on the sharp oscillation period between the eighties and late nineties,\" Patterson writes, \"social scientists working on crime run the risk of neglecting the historic pattern of high crime rates among blacks.\" But this hardly justifies the fact that these sociologists, otherwise so concerned with the effects of crime and the criminal-justice system, aren't more interested in this extraordinary rise and fall, which defied Moynihan's suggestion that crime and \"illegitimacy\" were inextricably linked. Apparently, this great oscillation neither required nor induced any great changes in black culture, and it has inspired nothing like a consensus among criminologists looking for a cause. Fine-grained cultural trends and well-meaning cultural initiatives often seem insignificant compared with the mysterious forces that can stealthily double or halve the violent-crime rate in the course of a decade or two. A chapter on \"street violence\" mentions the homicide drop only in passing, in its final paragraph.\n\nIn our political debates, as in cultural sociology, it can take some time for the stories to catch up to the statistics, especially because it takes a while to decipher what the statistics are saying. There is some evidence that, after years of rapid expansion, the African-American prison population levelled off, and may even have begun to decrease. But that hasn't made the recent arguments over race and the criminal-justice system any less urgent. The outrage in Missouri was followed, a week later, by outrage in New York, when a Staten Island grand jury declined to indict a white police officer who caused the death of an unarmed African-American man. In the aftermath, as some other commentators talked about America's legacy of racism, Patterson dissented. In a Slate interview, he said, \"I am not in favor of a national conversation on race.\" He said that most white people in America had come to accept racial equality, but added that \"there's a hard core of about twenty per cent which still remains thoroughly racist.\" The startling implication is that, even now, blacks in America live alongside an equal number of \"thoroughly racist\" whites. If this is true, it may explain the tragic sensibility that haunts Patterson's avowedly optimistic approach to race in America. He contends that black culture can and must change while conceding, less loudly, that \"thoroughly racist\" whites are likely to remain stubbornly the same.\n\nThere is a paradox at the heart of cultural sociology, which both seeks to explain behavior in broad, categorical terms and promises to respect its subjects' autonomy and intelligence. The results can be deflating, as the researchers find that their subjects are not stupid or crazy or heroic or transcendent-their cultural traditions just don't seem peculiar enough to answer the questions that motivate the research. Black cultural sociology has always been a project of comparison: the idea is not simply to understand black culture but to understand how it differs from white culture, as part of the broader push to reduce racial disparities that have changed surprisingly little since Du Bois's time. Fifty years after Moynihan's report, it's easy to understand why he was concerned. Even so, it's getting easier, too, to sympathize with his detractors, who couldn't understand why he thought new trends might explain old problems. If we want to learn more about black culture, we should study it. But, if we seek to answer the question of racial inequality in America, black culture won't tell us what we want to know. ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

Moynihan despaired that the illegitimacy rate for Negro babies was approaching twenty-five per cent. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the equivalent rate in 2013 was 71.5 per cent. (The rate for non-Hispanic white babies was 29.3 per cent.) Even so, Patterson and the other contributors avoid pronouncing upon \"ghetto culture\" or \"the culture of poverty,\" or even \"black culture.\" Instead, the authors see shifting patterns of belief and behavior that may nevertheless combine to make certain families less stable, or certain young people less employable. The hope is that, by paying close attention to culture, sociologists will be better equipped to identify these patterns, and help change them.\n\nIn Moynihan's view, the triumph of the civil-rights movement made his report that much more exigent: he was sure that as long as the Negro family was unstable the movement's promises of economic advancement and social equality would remain unfulfilled. Of course, alarming reports about the state of black culture have a long history in America: sometimes the accounts of deviant behavior were meant to explain why black oppression was justified; at other times, the accounts were meant to explain why black oppression was harmful.\n\nIn 1899, the trailblazing Negro scholar W. E. B. Du Bois drew on interviews and census data to produce \"The Philadelphia Negro: A Social Study,\" which helped shape the young discipline of sociology. Du Bois spent a year living in the neighborhood he wrote about, amid what he later described as \"an atmosphere of dirt, drunkenness, poverty, and crime.\" What emerged from this field research was a stern, unsentimental book; at times, Du Bois's disdain for his subjects, especially what he called \"the dregs,\" seemed as great as his outrage at the discrimination they faced. He observed, in language much harsher than Moynihan's, the large number of unmarried mothers, many of whom he characterized as \"ignorant and loose.\" In this book, as in the rest of his life, Du Bois did not shy away from prescription. He concluded by reminding whites of their duty to stop employment discrimination, which he called \"morally wrong, politically dangerous, industrially wasteful, and socially silly.\" But he reminded Negro readers that they had a duty, too: to work harder, to behave better, and to stem the tide of \"Negro crime,\" which was, he said, \"a menace to a civilized people.\" His chapter on \"The Negro Criminal,\" illustrated with charts and graphs, showed that Negroes were disproportionately represented in police records-though he suggested that the police, too, were acting disproportionately.\n\nLink copied\n\nIn the years before Moynihan, other social scientists refined Du Bois's approach, most famously Oscar Lewis, who used the term \"culture of poverty\" to describe what he saw among the Mexican families he studied. In retrospect, it seems clear that what infuriated many of Moynihan's readers wasn't so much what he wrote (he was mainly summarizing contemporary research) as what he represented. He was a young white political staffer explaining what was wrong with black communities, so he had to be wrong, even if he was right. One of the most revealing and representative responses came from James Farmer, the director of the Congress of Racial Equality: \"We are sick unto death of being analyzed, mesmerized, bought, sold, and slobbered over, while the same evils that are the ingredients of our oppression go unattended.\" Moynihan had stumbled into a quandary familiar to sociologists: sometimes your subject doesn't want to be subjectified.\n\nThe battle over Moynihan's report was a battle over the legacy of slavery, too, and Orlando Patterson was well qualified to join it. He earned his Ph.D. in 1965, with a dissertation on the sociology of Jamaican slavery, and in his best-known books, \"Slavery and Social Death\" and \"Freedom in the Making of Western Culture,\" he broadened his focus to consider the institution of slavery and how it gave rise to the ideal of freedom. (He has also published a trio of novels set in Jamaica.) In 1973, as the anti-Moynihan wave was cresting, Patterson offered a partial defense: rebutting Ryan's rebuttal, he wrote that writers like Moynihan \"in no way blame the victim.\" In fact, Patterson argued, Moynihan's report was overly \"deterministic,\" portraying black Americans as the inevitable victims of a long and oppressive history. Even more than Du Bois, Moynihan stressed the debilitating legacy of American slavery, asserting that it was \"indescribably worse\" than any form of bondage in the history of the world. Although Moynihan's fiercest critics didn't dispute this, they found themselves arguing that slavery had been less destructive than Moynihan thought: they celebrated the resilience of the black family in its non-standard forms. (Moynihan's \"illegitimacy\" statistics couldn't account for the grandparents and other extended-family members who might help a mother bring up her child.) Patterson called these scholars \"survivalists,\" in contrast to \"catastrophists,\" and years later the survivalists' work can seem too transparent in its aims. A number of sociologists, wary of insulting their subjects, seemed content to settle for flattery instead, depicting the black family as an extraordinary success story, no matter what the statistics said.\n\nPatterson sometimes implies that the Moynihan affair chastened sociology forever, but the culturalist impulse didn't go away. In 1978, William Julius Wilson popularized the term \"underclass,\" to describe the non-working poor who have been left behind by the disappearance of blue-collar jobs, but he also came to believe that \"social isolation\" helps create ways of living that perpetuate poverty. (Wilson argued that declining professional prospects made some black men less marriageable. Patterson thinks that declining marriage rates had more to do with the increased availability of contraception and abortion, which eroded cultural norms that had once compelled men to marry the women they impregnated.) And in 1999, on the hundredth anniversary of Du Bois's classic, Elijah Anderson published a new sociological study of poor black neighborhoods in Philadelphia, \"Code of the Street,\" which took seriously its informants' own characterization of themselves and their neighbors as either \"decent\" or \"street\" or, not infrequently, a bit of both. In \"The Cultural Matrix,\" Patterson updates and expands Anderson's taxonomy, listing \"three main social groups\" (the middle class, the working class, and \"disconnected street people\") that are common in \"disadvantaged\" African-American neighborhoods, along with \"four focal cultural configurations\" (adapted mainstream, proletarian, street, and hip-hop). In general, though, \"black youth\" means \"poor black youth,\" since poverty is what gives a project such as this one its urgency.\n\nThe contributors to \"The Cultural Matrix\" strive to avoid technical language, in what seems to be a brave but doomed attempt to attract casual readers to a book that is nearly seven hundred pages long. Some of the best cultural sociology draws its power from careful interviewing and observation. Anderson's \"Code of the Street\" was influential because it was widely read, and it was widely read because it often resembled a novel, full of complicated people and pungent testimonials. (One \"decent\" woman's account of raising five children had a nine-word opening sentence that no writing workshop could have improved: \"My son that's bad now-his name is Curtis.\") Some of Patterson's contributors have a similar facility with anecdote. A chapter about resisting the influence of poor neighborhoods includes a startling detail about a tough but crime-averse young man named Gary: \"He pats people down before they get in his car to make sure they are not carrying anything that could get him arrested.\" This, apparently, is what staying out of trouble might entail for a young black man in Baltimore.\n\nAmong the most important essays in the new anthology is Jody Miller's account of sexual relationships in St. Louis. An eighteen-year-old informant named Terence talks about participating in a sexual encounter that may not have been consensual, and his affectless language only makes the scene more discomfiting:\n\nI NTERVIEWER : Did you know the girl?\n\nT ERENCE : Naw, I ain't know her, know her like for real know her. But I knew her name or whatever. I had seen her before. That was it though.\n\nI NTERVIEWER : So when you all got there, she was in the room already?\n\nTERENCE : Naw, when we got there, she hadn't even got there yet. And when she came, she went in the room with my friend, the one she had already knew. And then after they was in there for a minute, he came out and let us know that she was gon', you know, run a train or whatever. So after that, we just went one by one.\n\nMiller knows that most readers will find this appalling, so she follows Terence's testimony with an assurance that incidents such as these reflect a legacy of racism-she mentions, for instance, \"the gross 'scientific' objectification of African women in the nineteenth century.\" This is a common technique among the new culturalists: every distressing contemporary phenomenon must be matched to an explicitly racist antecedent, however distant. This distance is what separates the culturalists from the structuralists. Patterson and the others are right that cultural traits often outgrow and outlive the circumstances of their creation. But often what remains is a circular explanation, description masquerading as a causal account. African-American gender relations are troubled because of \"cultural features\" that foster troubled gender relations.\n\nOne difference between the current era and Moynihan's, or Du Bois's, is that contemporary sociologists have a new potential culprit to blame for the disorder they see: hip-hop. The anthology includes a careful history of the genre by Wayne Marshall, an ethnomusicologist, who emphasizes its mutability. But Patterson, brave as ever, can't resist wading into this culture war. In one exuberant passage, he compares MC Hammer to Nietzsche, uses an obscure remix verse to contend that hip-hop routinely celebrates \"forced abortions,\" and pronounces Lil Wayne \"irredeemably vulgar\" and \"all too typical\" of the genre's devolution. And yet he is a conscientious enough social scientist to concede that there doesn't seem to be decisive evidence for a \"causal link\" between violent lyrics and violent behavior. Writing in 1999, Anderson mentioned hip-hop only in passing, suggesting that it supported, and was supported by, \"an ideology of alienation.\" (He was nearly as critical of \"popular love songs\" and \"television soap operas,\" which he judged to nourish girls' dreams of storybook romance. \"When a girl is approached by a boy,\" he wrote, \"her faith in the dream clouds her view of the situation.\") Now hip-hop has achieved cultural hegemony, but Patterson doesn't seem to have noticed that the genre has become markedly less pugnacious in recent years, thanks to non-thuggish stars like Drake, Nicki Minaj, Macklemore, Kendrick Lamar, and Iggy Azalea. The next wave of culturalist analyses will surely be able to explain how this music, too, is part of the problem.\n\nThe most provocative chapter in \"The Cultural Matrix\" is the final one, an exacting polemic by a Harvard colleague of Patterson's, Tommie Shelby, a professor of African and African-American studies and of philosophy. Shelby accepts, for the sake of argument, the idea that \"suboptimal cultural traits\" are the major impediment for many African-Americans seeking to escape poverty. He notes, in language much more delicate than Moynihan's (let alone Du Bois's), that \"some in ghetto communities are believed to devalue traditional coparenting and to eschew mainstream styles of childrearing.\" Still, Shelby is suspicious of attempts to reform these traits, and not only because he is wary of \"victim-blaming.\" He thinks that the \"ghetto poor\" have a right to remain defiantly unaltered. In his view, a program of compulsory cultural reform \"robs the ghetto poor of a choice that should be theirs alone-namely, whether the improved prospects for ending or ameliorating ghetto poverty are worth the loss of moral pride they would incur by conceding the insulting view that they have not shown themselves to be deserving of better treatment.\" For Shelby, opposing hypothetical future government programs is also a way of registering frustration with past government action, and inaction. \"Given its failure to secure just social conditions,\" he writes, \"the state lacks the moral standing to act as an agent of moral reform.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nThis \"moral standing\" argument is too powerful for its own good, because it would invalidate just about everything done by the U.S. government, or any other. The crucial question is not whether the state has the \"moral standing\" to reform cultural practices in the ghetto but whether it has the ability. Politicians love to call for such reform; Obama could have been channelling Moynihan when he said, in his famous 2008 speech on race, that African-Americans needed to take more responsibility for their own communities by \"demanding more from our fathers.\" But a demand is not a program. Patterson, in the essay for the Chronicle , suggested that \"cultural values, norms, beliefs, and habitual practices may be easier to change than structural ones.\" And yet a chapter in the anthology, about a federal relationship-counselling program called Building Strong Families, provides less reason for confidence. In most cases, the follow-up reports suggested that the program had little or no effect on the relationships it sought to help; in one city, Baltimore, couples who received counselling were markedly more likely to split. (The authors, looking for good news, voice a faint hope that the demise of those relationships \"may lead to better repartnering outcomes.\")\n\nA few years ago, in The Nation , Patterson responded to some disappointing statistics showing high unemployment and persistent segregation by urging African-Americans to \"do some serious soul-searching.\" But part of the problem with calls for cultural reform is that the so-called \"ghetto poor\" tend to agree with the kinds of messages that outsiders, whether tough-love politicians or self-conscious sociologists alike, would urge upon them: work matters, family matters, culture matters. Ethan Fosse draws on a number of recent surveys of the \"disconnected\"-the term refers to young people who are neither employed nor attending school-and finds that they adhere more strongly to various mainstream cultural values than their connected counterparts do: they are more likely to say that having a good career is \"very important\" to them, and seventy-four per cent of them say that black men \"don't take their education seriously enough,\" compared with only sixty-two per cent of connected black youth. Surveys also suggest that disconnected young people are more likely to agree with Patterson's critique of hip-hop-the people most susceptible to the genre's influence turn out to be the ones most skeptical of it. In an overview chapter, Patterson wryly notes that results such as these may pose a conundrum. \"Sociologists love subjects who tell truth to mainstream power,\" he writes. \"They grow uncomfortable when these subjects tell mainstream truths to sociologists.\" But none of this offers encouragement for people who think that cultural change is a key to social uplift.\n\nJust how dire is the situation? Moynihan worried that \"the Negro community\" was in a state of decline, bedevilled by an increasingly matriarchal family structure, which led to the increasing incidence of crime and delinquency. Much of Moynihan's historical data was scant or inconclusive, but, when it came to violent crime, he guessed correctly: in the fifteen years after he published his report, the country's homicide rate doubled, with blacks overrepresented among both perpetrators and victims. America, and Negro America in particular, was at the beginning of a years-long catastrophe. But what happened next was even more surprising: beginning in the early nineteen-nineties, the homicide rate, like other rates of violent crime, began to decline; today, African-Americans are about half as likely to be involved in a homicide, either as perpetrator or as victim, as they were two decades ago. Patterson and Fosse write that, in the years after Moynihan's report, a \"discrepancy\" developed between the optimistic scholarship of sociologists, eager to emphasize the resilience of black families, and \"the reality of urban black life,\" which was increasingly grim. But the contemporary era has been marked by the opposite discrepancy: even as the new culturalists were resurrecting Moynihan's diagnosis, the scourge of crime was in retreat.\n\nPatterson, committed to his critique of African-American cultural life, can't bring himself to celebrate this news. Hip-hop is important to him because it fuels his suspicion that, despite the drop in crime, black culture is in trouble. Fosse seems to share this pessimism, reporting \"an alarming increase in the percentage of black youth who are structurally disconnected over the past decade.\" He uses survey data to create a fitted curve, showing that \"nearly 25 percent\" of black youth were disconnected in 2012, while the white rate \"has remained below 15 percent.\" (The curve is not included in the book.) In fact, the data suggest that percentages of disconnection among black and white youth have been rising at about the same rate over the past decade; what's most alarming is not the recent increase but the ongoing disparity. Among Patterson, Fosse, and their peers, the tendency to write as if black culture were in exceptional crisis seems to be what a sociologist might call an unexamined injunctive norm: a shared prescriptive rule, one so ingrained that its followers don't even realize it exists.\n\nAnd so the good news on crime gets downplayed. \"By focusing too much on the sharp oscillation period between the eighties and late nineties,\" Patterson writes, \"social scientists working on crime run the risk of neglecting the historic pattern of high crime rates among blacks.\" But this hardly justifies the fact that these sociologists, otherwise so concerned with the effects of crime and the criminal-justice system, aren't more interested in this extraordinary rise and fall, which defied Moynihan's suggestion that crime and \"illegitimacy\" were inextricably linked. Apparently, this great oscillation neither required nor induced any great changes in black culture, and it has inspired nothing like a consensus among criminologists looking for a cause. Fine-grained cultural trends and well-meaning cultural initiatives often seem insignificant compared with the mysterious forces that can stealthily double or halve the violent-crime rate in the course of a decade or two. A chapter on \"street violence\" mentions the homicide drop only in passing, in its final paragraph.\n\nIn our political debates, as in cultural sociology, it can take some time for the stories to catch up to the statistics, especially because it takes a while to decipher what the statistics are saying. There is some evidence that, after years of rapid expansion, the African-American prison population levelled off, and may even have begun to decrease. But that hasn't made the recent arguments over race and the criminal-justice system any less urgent. The outrage in Missouri was followed, a week later, by outrage in New York, when a Staten Island grand jury declined to indict a white police officer who caused the death of an unarmed African-American man. In the aftermath, as some other commentators talked about America's legacy of racism, Patterson dissented. In a Slate interview, he said, \"I am not in favor of a national conversation on race.\" He said that most white people in America had come to accept racial equality, but added that \"there's a hard core of about twenty per cent which still remains thoroughly racist.\" The startling implication is that, even now, blacks in America live alongside an equal number of \"thoroughly racist\" whites. If this is true, it may explain the tragic sensibility that haunts Patterson's avowedly optimistic approach to race in America. He contends that black culture can and must change while conceding, less loudly, that \"thoroughly racist\" whites are likely to remain stubbornly the same.\n\nThere is a paradox at the heart of cultural sociology, which both seeks to explain behavior in broad, categorical terms and promises to respect its subjects' autonomy and intelligence. The results can be deflating, as the researchers find that their subjects are not stupid or crazy or heroic or transcendent-their cultural traditions just don't seem peculiar enough to answer the questions that motivate the research. Black cultural sociology has always been a project of comparison: the idea is not simply to understand black culture but to understand how it differs from white culture, as part of the broader push to reduce racial disparities that have changed surprisingly little since Du Bois's time. Fifty years after Moynihan's report, it's easy to understand why he was concerned. Even so, it's getting easier, too, to sympathize with his detractors, who couldn't understand why he thought new trends might explain old problems. If we want to learn more about black culture, we should study it. But, if we seek to answer the question of racial inequality in America, black culture won't tell us what we want to know. ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "I wonder how they were dressed when they were put in the ground. Trayvon and Breonna and George. Each was born or mostly reared in the American South, an area defined as much by its powerful aesthetic as by its racial segregation, a place where people of color wear their culture on their backs, like a second skin, and a statement: This is a synthesis of all that is American, of all that we are and that you are, too. This is how we do. Given the importance of self-presentation in that part of the world, the correctness of John Lewis's suit as he was beaten in Alabama, or the fall of his coat as he and other freedom fighters were gassed in Tennessee, or the sharp brim of Martin Luther King, Jr.,'s hat when he was arrested for loitering in Alabama, created a distinct impression of unbendable self-possession in the midst of chaos, of moral rectitude in a sea of shit. That is what made me wonder how Trayvon and Breonna and George's families dressed them before they were put in the ground. In stateliness and blood? The same kind of stateliness that I see in Grace Wales Bonner's clothes?\n\nThe twenty-nine-year-old London-based designer-a slight woman with enormous intellectual and artistic ambitions-draws from the creative and thus political minds of the modern African diaspora, not only to inform her art but to reveal how style has grown out of the diaspora itself, linking together our fragmented worlds in ways that others may not have noticed, but that we have. Equally at home with Aimé Césaire and Léopold Sédar Senghor's theories about Negritude as she is with the history of Christian Dior-last April, she worked with the fabled house to reinterpret its New Look-Wales Bonner has been sui generis from the start, in part because, unlike many other designers, she doesn't reference the past to service trend; in her work, she aims to make the broken history of the Black artist and intellectual in African, European, and American culture whole. Wales Bonner has always been drawn to Black thinkers and creators whose relationship to the society that made them is a passionate but uneasy one-including the abolitionist Ethiopian leader Haile Selassie I, the Caribbean poet Derek Walcott, the Brooklyn visual artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, the Chicago-based painter Kerry James Marshall, and the Harlem writer Langston Hughes. These cultural forefathers have made explicit and implicit appearances in Wales Bonner's designs, which are generally tailored to emphasize the dignity and the line of their wearers, through the dash of a jacket pocket, the lay of the lapels, the drape of a pants leg, or the interplay of each element with the others.\n\nUsing, almost exclusively, models of color-the collection with which she graduated from Central Saint Martins, in 2014, was called Afrique; her Autumn/Winter 2015 collection was titled Ebonics-Wales Bonner evokes the kind of complicated, fascinating, and rich history of people of color that one finds in James Weldon Johnson's wonderful 1930 study, \"Black Manhattan,\" or in the culture of Black leisure resorts that is conjured up in Toni Morrison's 2003 novel, \"Love,\" or in the lovesick voice of colonialism-influenced Shabine, in Walcott's 1979 poem \"The Schooner Flight\"-lush worlds shaped by the artists' discipline. And Wales Bonner's apparel is as disciplined as it is lush, cool out of necessity; she wants her love to be constructive, not explosive.\n\nDiscipline and cool don't mean that Wales Bonner's work is devoid of joy; her costuming has the alchemy of spirit and mind, style and body, that you can find in Ishmael Reed's \"neo-hoodooism,\" say-in, for instance, the opening of his 1972 novel, \"Mumbo Jumbo\": \"A True Sport, the Mayor of New Orleans, spiffy in his patent-leather brown and white shoes, his plaid suit, the Rudolph Valentino parted-down-the-middle hair style, sits in his office.\" (Wales Bonner titled her Autumn/Winter 2019 collection after Reed's novel; she also designed a tunic with Reed's name stitched across the front.)\n\nWales Bonner designs women's wear as well as men's-Meghan Markle wore her white belted trench dress when she and Prince Harry introduced their newborn son, Archie, to the press-but it's her exploration of and commitment to the art, history, and sexuality of the Black male form that distinguishes her style. Wales Bonner's parents-her mother is white and English, and works as a business consultant; her father, a Black Jamaican, is a lawyer-separated when she was around five, and, although she and her two sisters grew up primarily in a prosperous, predominantly white section of southeast London, she spent a significant amount of time with her father and his family, a world away, in Stockwell. On bus rides across town to see her dad, Wales Bonner observed a multitude of communities, where Nigerian and Jamaican immigrants and others came together in a European context. What she saw was enhanced by the books that her father, an avid reader of writing from the West Indies and elsewhere, passed on to his daughter. Politics was part of the fabric of both of Wales Bonner's homes. Her mother, Julie Wales, said of her daughters, \"The thread running through any conversations I might have had with my girls about potentially challenging situations or people usually focussed on our power. For Grace and her sisters, this meant understanding, knowing, and feeling their worth. Also appreciating the importance of education, self-expression, and self-definition.\"\n\nWhen Wales Bonner enrolled at Central Saint Martins, she wasn't sure whether she wanted to be a historian or an artist. In 2013, she wrote her dissertation, \"Black on Black,\" which is a study about \"Black creatives and thinkers,\" who, through their very existence, represent a \"new identity politics,\" which is to say a world in which Blackness is not just one thing. Black history, she writes, is best understood as a reality that's been cut up, a collection of pieces that has its own ethos, one that becomes more complex, elegant, and vibrant from generation to generation. You can't apply Western ideas of linearity to any of it. If you do, you're a non-hoodoo fool.\n\nAt Central Saint Martins, Wales Bonner found herself more and more drawn to clothing as a means of expression. In 2013, she came to New York to assist Camilla Nickerson, the fashion editor at Vogue , for a time. Nickerson encouraged her love of research, and her interest in using garments as a way to say something about the times, society, and the nature of storytelling in general. Back in London, Wales Bonner began to exhibit her work, which was, she says, a reaction to the way in which Black culture was represented in fashion. The industry was quick to support her vision. Here was a woman who was creating menswear in a new way, with less heteronormative flash than there was in Ozwald Boateng's renderings of street cool, and with more control and oomph than Richard James put into his sleek suiting. Wales Bonner was awarded, in 2016, the LVMH Prize; at the 2017 GQ Awards, she was named Breakthrough Designer of the Year; and in May, 2019, she became a beneficiary of the British Fashion Council/Vogue Designer Fashion Fund. Her work, however, isn't restricted to the runway. The adventurous Serpentine Gallery, in London, has hosted her installations; in 2019, when she released her Mumbo Jumbo line, the space welcomed not only Wales Bonner's work but its inspiration himself, Ishmael Reed. Although the overwhelmingly white fashion world has, for decades, marginalized-or treated as a kind of \"urban\" sideshow-the stories that Wales Bonner wants to tell, she has become, in our \"woke\" era, one of the people to whom fashion editors look to understand the interplay of race and style. These days, woke makes money.\n\nBut a hallmark of Wales Bonner's self-presentation is a certain wariness, a kind of self-protectiveness, which is meant, I think, to safeguard the emotional openness that goes into the work. You can see that vulnerability in the writing she did before she found her true language in clothes. In \"Black on Black,\" she quotes Amiri Baraka (LeRoi Jones) in a way that indicates her determination to speak to the African diaspora, despite and because of all the blood that was spilled to create it. What did Baraka write? What is Wales Bonner endeavoring to say? \"Our terribleness is our survival as beautiful beings anywhere.\"\n\n-Hilton Als\n\nStyled by Tom Guinness; set design by Andrew Lim Clarkson; hair by Akiko Kawasaki;\nmakeup by Kentaro Kondo\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "Kendrick Lamar and the Mantle of Black Genius\n\nPrestige has been chasing the Compton rapper Kendrick Lamar ever since he broke through in 2011-first, in hip-hop, when he was the protégé of Dr. Dre, and then, beyond. His major-label début, \"good kid, m.A.A.d city,\" was deemed an \" instant masterpiece \"; his most recent release, \"D.A.M.N.,\" an \" instant classic .\" He has been hailed as a \" literary genius \" and a visual one . His lyrics have been annotated by the Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Michael Chabon, and he himself collected the Pulitzer Prize, in music, in 2018, becoming the first pop artist ever to do so.\n\nMuch like Kanye West before him, critics and fans view Lamar as an unparalleled virtuoso who pushes boundaries with each new project, his coronation to the pantheon of great contemporary artists not so much an \"if\" as a \"when.\" These accolades, obviously, aren't without merit. Lamar is a prodigiously gifted lyricist and performer who consistently makes bold aesthetic choices. He deploys lacerating wordplay, nearly frantic in its motion yet piercing in its lucidity. When his verbal skills combine with his fine-tuned hood morality, Lamar opens a window onto an imperilled, alienating existence: what it's like to navigate the territorial Compton streets with a sixth sense for trouble.\n\nRead an excerpt in this week's issue.\n\nBoth West and Lamar have been christened with the glow of Black genius , which the writer Jason Parham defined as \"an uncanny power to awaken our deepest and most sacred sentiments.\" The Roots drummer Questlove connects this genius to extraordinary insight into the everyday Black struggle: \"Anyone who is Black that started in meagre or so-so conditions that are not that of the privileged of the world-when they finally transform to a higher level, it is guilt they feel. Having survivor's guilt. And that is one thing that every Black genius wrestles with.\" For Lamar, survivor's guilt came to a head in 2015, in the form of \"To Pimp a Butterfly,\" where he grappled with celebrity and civic responsibility-the internal conflicts and the external pressures, the tension between materialism and spirituality. It is an album that begins with a Wesley Snipes parable on the exploitation of the Black artist and ends with a phantom Tupac interview. \"We ain't even really rappin',\" the late rapper says from beyond the grave, with his living heir apparent listening intently. \"We just letting our dead homies tell stories for us.\"\n\nThe intersection of Black genius and Black strife is the focus of a new book, \" The Butterfly Effect: How Kendrick Lamar Ignited the Soul of Black America .\" The writer Marcus J. Moore places the rapper on the list of historic Black musicians who \"spoke to us and for us.\" \"They created music in which we could see our full, beautiful selves, and they helped us remember that we weren't second-class citizens, even when the world tried to render us invisible,\" Moore writes. \"America can beat you down if you let it, but through Sly's howl, Curtis's falsetto, and D'Angelo's hum, you felt the beauty and bleakness of black culture.\" Moore points to Black genius itself as an act of dissent. \"Sometimes that's what protest is. It isn't solely about picket signs and clever chants, it's about the full breadth of the experience, about wading through the misery and finding light through it all.\"\n\nThe beauty and bleakness of Black culture are on full display in Moore's examination of Lamar's musicianship. The book ties his radical music and its incredible growth curve to the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, in 2012, then a travelling apprenticeship with West during the \"Yeezus\" tour, in 2013, and finally a trip to South Africa to learn about Nelson Mandela, in 2014. Here, Lamar's breakthrough is presented as a turning point for modern Black artistic expression, not just in America but in Africa as well, ushering in what Moore describes as the \"most fertile period of socially conscious black music\" since the nineteen-seventies. Lamar-like Dave Chappelle and LeBron James before him-becomes a crossover star so transcendent that he embodies the American ideal of upward mobility.\n\nLamar's career is still unfolding, thus making him difficult to evaluate and scrutinize. At thirty-three, he has conquered nearly every cultural sphere, and that success has made him somewhat impenetrable. His peerless genius is a bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy. There has been little need for criticism but little room for it either. The white-hot reverence for his work can, occasionally, blot out valid grievances. On the \"To Pimp a Butterfly\" closing track \"Mortal Man,\" his hero worship of Michael Jackson extends to the denial of abuse. Subsequently, in 2018, Lamar threatened to pull his music from Spotify in response to a new policy punishing abusers like the late rapper XXXtentacion and the disgraced R. & B. icon R. Kelly. Though Lamar has been praised for the ethics of leadership displayed in his work, he has remained silent throughout a summer of protests and riots.\n\nMoore's cultural history is less concerned with exploring the contradictions and complexities of Lamar's life and career than with weighing its outsized impact. The book pieces together the notoriously private rapper's background-his N.B.A. aspirations, his working-class roots, his experience of the L.A. riots, and, at five, his early exposure to gun violence-illustrating both the connective tissue of Black experience and how Lamar drew upon it to become a generational voice. Here are just some of the threads used to make a case for Lamar's significance: the white Seattle rapper Macklemore's absurd rap Grammys sweep, in 2014, the public outcry in response, and his subsequent public apology to Lamar; Lamar's controversial BET performance, in 2015, and his war with conservative commentators such as Geraldo Rivera; and Lamar's unforgettable Grammys return, in 2016, when he performed in a blue jumpsuit along a chain gang. In each case, Moore spells out what these events say about the politics of race in public space. He identifies Lamar as the unlikely point of intersection between the Pulitzer Board and the Disney conglomerate-an artist capable of clearing the barrier to entry into highbrow culture and also radicalizing the music of a billion-dollar cat superhero franchise. Principally, he points out how Lamar's rise runs parallel with that of the Black Lives Matter movement and counter to the rise of President Trump.\n\nThe trouble with chronicling genius is that, if not careful, the process can quickly veer into hagiography. The most resonant chapters in Moore's book are less focussed on kingmaking than on craft and coöperation: the \"lesser\" influences that spark inventiveness, such as the high-school English teacher, Regis Inge, who brought poetry into Lamar's life and fostered his interest in creative writing, or the instrumentalist Terrace Martin, who introduced the saxophonist Kamasi Washington and the pianist Robert Glasper to the \"Butterfly\" sessions. It is in these snapshots that we learn how talent only becomes genius when nurtured. One passage illustrates how the indie-rap empire that Kendrick now fronts, Top Dawg Entertainment, is the byproduct of so many coincidences that its success begins to feel like destiny, when in fact it has also been made with hard work.\n\nTop Dawg Entertainment became the support system that allowed Lamar to reach his creative peaks. His artistry bloomed in combination with Martin and the producer Sounwave, and his sound was refined under the stewardship of the engineer Derek Ali. His skills as a lyricist were sharpened by the competitive, albeit friendly, atmosphere of Black Hippy, the supergroup that formed in 2009 with Jay Rock, ScHoolBoy Q, and Ab-Soul. The visual acumen displayed in his videos was heightened by his creative partnership with Dave Free, who co-directs with him in the Grammy-winning \"The Little Homies.\" And none of this would have been possible without Top Dawg himself (a.k.a. Anthony Tiffith), who provided structure and oversight, creating the space where Lamar grew into his personality. \"This was boot camp and domination was the ultimate goal,\" Moore writes, and it's as if running that gauntlet prepared Lamar for greatness.\n\nIn essence, this is the story of how Lamar became the kind of rapper who could make a paradigm-shifting album like \"To Pimp a Butterfly,\" and how \"To Pimp a Butterfly,\" in turn, pushed the pop landscape toward jazz and soul sounds and made space for more radical forms of Blackness in entertainment, for rule-breaking. \"That record changed music, and we're still seeing the effects of it. It went beyond jazz; it meant that intellectually stimulating music doesn't have to be underground. It can be mainstream,\" Washington told Pitchfork , in 2017. \"It just didn't change the music. It changed the audience.\" Moore's enthusiasm for Kendrick's work jumps off the page, and while that occasionally drifts into hyperbole and conjecture, it fuels a deep desire to trace the music's genealogy. In so doing, the book explores how hip-hop culture is inextricably linked to the Black American experience. An entire section is devoted to victims of police brutality, their stories, their cases, and the injustice of acquittal after acquittal for the cops involved. The Wu-Tang Clan rapper Method Man, who grew up on Staten Island, speaks of the prohibited chokehold that killed Eric Garner in the borough, in 2014, as if inherent to life there. Another of the victims, Michael Brown, was an aspiring rapper himself and a Lamar fan. Though Kendrick's controversial take on Brown's death is somewhat glossed over, the book is constantly putting into context how the rapper's art is a product of the same trauma and working in service to the Black communities that experienced that trauma.\n\nOf course, it is always dangerous to make any kind of definitive claim about artistic genius. There is no real barometer, and the atmosphere can change quickly. Those who proclaimed Kanye a genius years ago may feel differently today. In a 2018 essay, \" Kanye West and Why the Myth of 'Genius' Needs to Die ,\" the critic Jayson Greene wrote, \"The larger cultural insanity of genius twists all of us. To believe in genius is to believe in saviors. It is to lie in wait for cult leaders to arise. Elevating geniuses automatically subjugates the rest of us.\" As Marjorie Garber put it, in the 2002 essay \" Our Genius Problem ,\" \"The pursuit of genius is the pursuit of an illusion.\" This is especially true in the arts, where the fruits of collaboration are too often credited to singular talent. Moore is constantly trying to strike a balance between honoring Lamar's artistry, acknowledging his many inspirations and allies, and placing him at the center of something bigger than himself. He is described as possessing both types of genius-natural and learned, brilliant and industrious-and as an auteur of near-flawless creative vision, but also as the product of a network of creators and as the living legacy of the tangle of Black geniuses that came before. He is spoken of as just short of a savior here-the bestower of instant classics. But at this stage, it is impossible to know just how much of his \"genius\" is transitory. That's the thing: only time can tell.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Black Body: Rereading James Baldwin's \"Stranger in the Village\"\n\nThen the bus began driving into clouds, and between one cloud and the next we caught glimpses of the town below. It was suppertime and the town was a constellation of yellow points. We arrived thirty minutes after leaving that town, which was called Leuk. The train to Leuk had come in from Visp, the train from Visp had come from Bern, and the train before that was from Zurich, from which I had started out in the afternoon. Three trains, a bus, and a short stroll, all of it through beautiful country, and then we reached Leukerbad in darkness. So Leukerbad, not far in terms of absolute distance, was not all that easy to get to. August 2, 2014: it was James Baldwin's birthday. Were he alive, he would be turning ninety. He is one of those people just on the cusp of escaping the contemporary and slipping into the historical-John Coltrane would have turned eighty-eight this year; Martin Luther King, Jr., would have turned eighty-five-people who could still be with us but who feel, at times, very far away, as though they lived centuries ago.\n\nJames Baldwin left Paris and came to Leukerbad for the first time in 1951. His lover Lucien Happersberger's family had a chalet in a village up in the mountains. And so Baldwin, who was depressed and distracted at the time, went, and the village (which is also called Loèche-les-Bains) proved to be a refuge for him. His first trip was in the summer, and lasted two weeks. Then he returned, to his own surprise, for two more winters. His first novel, \"Go Tell It on the Mountain,\" found its final form here. He had struggled with the book for eight years, and he finally finished it in this unlikely retreat. He wrote something else, too, an essay called \"Stranger in the Village\"; it was this essay, even more than the novel, that brought me to Leukerbad.\n\n\"Stranger in the Village\" first appeared in Harper's Magazine in 1953, and then in the essay collection \"Notes of a Native Son,\" in 1955. It recounts the experience of being black in an all-white village. It begins with a sense of an extreme journey, like Charles Darwin's in the Galápagos or Tété-Michel Kpomassie's in Greenland. But then it opens out into other concerns and into a different voice, swivelling to look at the American racial situation in the nineteen-fifties. The part of the essay that focusses on the Swiss village is both bemused and sorrowful. Baldwin is alert to the absurdity of being a writer from New York who is considered in some way inferior by Swiss villagers, many of whom have never travelled. But, later in the essay, when he writes about race in America, he is not at all bemused. He is angry and prophetic, writing with a hard clarity and carried along by a precipitous eloquence.\n\nI took a room at the Hotel Mercure Bristol the night I arrived. I opened the windows to a dark view, but I knew that in the darkness loomed the Daubenhorn mountain. I ran a hot bath and lay neck-deep in the water with my old paperback copy of \"Notes of a Native Son.\" The tinny sound from my laptop was Bessie Smith singing \"I'm Wild About That Thing,\" a filthy blues number and a masterpiece of plausible deniability: \"Don't hold it baby when I cry / Give me every bit of it, else I'd die / I'm wild about that thing.\" She could be singing about a trombone. And it was there in the bath, with his words and her voice, that I had my body-double moment: here I was in Leukerbad, with Bessie Smith singing across the years from 1929; and I am black like him; and I am slender; and have a gap in my front teeth; and am not especially tall (no, write it: short); and am cool on the page and animated in person, except when it is the other way around; and I was once a fervid teen-age preacher (Baldwin: \"Nothing that has happened to me since equals the power and the glory that I sometimes felt when, in the middle of a sermon, I knew that I was somehow, by some miracle, really carrying, as they said, 'the Word'-when the church and I were one\"); and I, too, left the church; and I call New York home even when not living there; and feel myself in all places, from New York City to rural Switzerland, the custodian of a black body, and have to find the language for all of what that means to me and to the people who look at me. The ancestor had briefly taken possession of the descendant. It was a moment of identification, and in the days that followed that moment was a guide.\n\n\"From all available evidence no black man had ever set foot in this tiny Swiss village before I came,\" Baldwin wrote. But the village has grown considerably since his visits, more than sixty years ago. They've seen blacks now; I wasn't a remarkable sight. There were a few glances at the hotel when I was checking in, and in the fine restaurant just up the road, but there are always glances. There are glances in Zurich, where I am spending the summer, and there are glances in New York City, which has been my home for fourteen years. There are glances all over Europe and in India, and anywhere I go outside Africa. The test is how long the glances last, whether they become stares, with what intent they occur, whether they contain any degree of hostility or mockery, and to what extent connections, money, or mode of dress shield me in these situations. To be a stranger is to be looked at, but to be black is to be looked at especially. (\"The children shout Neger! Neger! as I walk along the streets.\") Leukerbad has changed, but in which way? There were, in fact, no bands of children on the street, and few children anywhere at all. Presumably the children of Leukerbad, like children the world over, were indoors, frowning over computer games, checking Facebook, or watching music videos. Perhaps some of the older folks I saw in the streets were once the very children who had been so surprised by the sight of Baldwin, and about whom, in the essay, he struggles to take a reasonable tone: \"In all of this, in which it must be conceded that there was the charm of genuine wonder and in which there was certainly no element of intentional unkindness, there was yet no suggestion that I was human: I was simply a living wonder.\" But now the children or grandchildren of those children are connected to the world in a different way. Maybe some xenophobia or racism are part of their lives, but part of their lives, too, are Beyoncé, Drake, and Meek Mill, the music I hear pulsing from Swiss clubs on Friday nights.\n\nBaldwin had to bring his records with him in the fifties, like a secret stash of medicine, and he had to haul his phonograph up to Leukerbad, so that the sound of the American blues could keep him connected to a Harlem of the spirit. I listened to some of the same music while I was there, as a way of being with him: Bessie Smith singing \"I Need A Little Sugar In My Bowl\" (\"I need a little sugar in my bowl / I need a little hot dog on my roll\"), Fats Waller singing \"Your Feet's Too Big.\" I listened to my own playlist as well: Bettye Swann, Billie Holiday, Jean Wells, \"Coltrane Plays the Blues,\" the Physics, Childish Gambino. The music you travel with helps you to create your own internal weather. But the world participates, too: when I sat down to lunch at the Römerhof restaurant one afternoon-that day, all the customers and staff were white-the music playing overhead was Whitney Houston's \"I Wanna Dance With Somebody.\" History is now and black America.\n\nAt dinner, at a pizzeria, there were glances. A table of British tourists stared at me. But the waitress was part black, and at the hotel one of the staff members at the spa was an older black man. \"People are trapped in history, and history is trapped in them,\" Baldwin wrote. But it is also true that the little pieces of history move around at a tremendous speed, settling with a not-always-clear logic, and rarely settling for long. And perhaps more interesting than my not being the only black person in the village is the plain fact that many of the other people I saw were also foreigners. This was the biggest change of all. If, back then, the village had a pious and convalescent air about it, the feel of \"a lesser Lourdes,\" it is much busier now, packed with visitors from other parts of Switzerland, Germany, France, Italy, and all over Europe, Asia, and the Americas. It has become the most popular thermal resort in the Alps. The municipal baths were full. There are hotels on every street, at every price point, and there are restaurants and luxury-goods shops. If you wish to buy an eye-wateringly costly watch at forty-six hundred feet above sea level, it is now possible to do so.\n\nThe better hotels have their own thermal pools. At the Hotel Mercure Bristol, I took an elevator down to the spa and sat in the dry sauna. A few minutes later, I slipped into the pool and floated outside in the warm water. Others were there, but not many. A light rain fell. We were ringed by mountains and held in the immortal blue.\n\n* * *\n\nIn her brilliant \"Harlem Is Nowhere,\" Sharifa Rhodes-Pitts writes, \"In almost every essay James Baldwin wrote about Harlem, there is a moment when he commits a literary sleight-of-hand so particular that, if he'd been an athlete, sportscasters would have codified the maneuver and named it 'the Jimmy.' I think of it in cinematic terms, because its effect reminds me of a technique wherein camera operators pan out by starting with a tight shot and then zoom out to a wide view while the lens remains focused on a point in the distance.\" This move, this sudden widening of focus, is present even in his essays that are not about Harlem. In \"Stranger in the Village,\" there's a passage about seven pages in where one can feel the rhetoric revving up, as Baldwin prepares to leave behind the calm, fabular atmosphere of the opening section. Of the villagers, he writes:\n\nThese people cannot be, from the point of view of power, strangers anywhere in the world; they have made the modern world, in effect, even if they do not know it. The most illiterate among them is related, in a way I am not, to Dante, Shakespeare, Michelangelo, Aeschylus, Da Vinci, Rembrandt, and Racine; the cathedral at Chartres says something to them which it cannot say to me, as indeed would New York's Empire State Building, should anyone here ever see it. Out of their hymns and dances come Beethoven and Bach. Go back a few centuries and they are in their full glory-but I am in Africa, watching the conquerors arrive.\n\nWhat is this list about? Does it truly bother Baldwin that the people of Leukerbad are related, through some faint familiarity, to Chartres? That some distant genetic thread links them to the Beethoven string quartets? After all, as he argues later in the essay, no one can deny the impact \"the presence of the Negro has had on the American character.\" He understands the truth and the art in Bessie Smith's work. He does not, and cannot-I want to believe-rate the blues below Bach. But there was a certain narrowness in received ideas of black culture in the nineteen-fifties. In the time since then, there has been enough black cultural achievement from which to compile an all-star team: there's been Coltrane and Monk and Miles, and Ella and Billie and Aretha. Toni Morrison, Wole Soyinka, and Derek Walcott happened, as have Audre Lorde, and Chinua Achebe, and Bob Marley. The body was not abandoned for the mind's sake: Alvin Ailey, Arthur Ashe, and Michael Jordan happened, too. The source of jazz and the blues also gave the world hip-hop, Afrobeat, dancehall, and house. And, yes, when James Baldwin died in 1987, he, too, was recognized as an all-star.\n\nThinking further about the cathedral at Chartres, about the greatness of that achievement and about how, in his view, it included blacks only in the negative, as devils, Baldwin writes that \"the American Negro has arrived at his identity by virtue of the absoluteness of his estrangement from his past.\" But the distant African past has also become much more available than it was in 1953. It would not occur to me to think that, centuries ago, I was \"in Africa, watching the conquerors arrive.\" But I suspect that for Baldwin it is, in part, a rhetorical move, a grim cadence on which to end a paragraph. In \"A Question of Identity\" (another essay collected in \"Notes of a Native Son\"), he writes, \"The truth about that past is not that it is too brief, or too superficial, but only that we, having turned our faces so resolutely away from it, have never demanded from it what it has to give.\" The fourteenth-century court artists of Ife made bronze sculptures using a complicated casting process lost to Europe since antiquity, and which was not rediscovered there until the Renaissance. Ife sculptures are equal to the works of Ghiberti or Donatello. From their precision and formal sumptuousness we can extrapolate the contours of a great monarchy, a network of sophisticated ateliers, and a cosmopolitan world of trade and knowledge. And it was not only Ife. All of West Africa was a cultural ferment. From the egalitarian government of the Igbo to the goldwork of the Ashanti courts, the brass sculpture of Benin, the military achievement of the Mandinka Empire and the musical virtuosi who praised those war heroes, this was a region of the world too deeply invested in art and life to simply be reduced to a caricature of \"watching the conquerors arrive.\" We know better now. We know it with a stack of corroborating scholarship and we know it implicitly, so that even making a list of the accomplishments feels faintly tedious, and is helpful mainly as a counter to Eurocentrism.\n\nThere's no world in which I would surrender the intimidating beauty of Yoruba-language poetry for, say, Shakespeare's sonnets, nor one in which I'd prefer the chamber orchestras of Brandenburg to the koras of Mali. I'm happy to own all of it. This carefree confidence is, in part, the gift of time. It is a dividend of the struggle of people from earlier generations. I feel no alienation in museums. But this question of filiation tormented Baldwin considerably. He was sensitive to what was great in world art, and sensitive to his own sense of exclusion from it. He made a similar list in the title essay of \"Notes of a Native Son\" (one begins to feel that lists like this had been flung at him during arguments): \"In some subtle way, in a really profound way, I brought to Shakespeare, Bach, Rembrandt, to the Stones of Paris, to the Cathedral at Chartres, and the Empire State Building a special attitude. These were not really my creations, they did not contain my history; I might search them in vain forever for any reflection of myself. I was an interloper; this was not my heritage.\" The lines throb with sadness. What he loves does not love him in return.\n\nThis is where I part ways with Baldwin. I disagree not with his particular sorrow but with the self-abnegation that pinned him to it. Bach, so profoundly human, is my heritage. I am not an interloper when I look at a Rembrandt portrait. I care for them more than some white people do, just as some white people care more for aspects of African art than I do. I can oppose white supremacy and still rejoice in Gothic architecture. In this, I stand with Ralph Ellison: \"The values of my own people are neither 'white' nor 'black,' they are American. Nor can I see how they could be anything else, since we are people who are involved in the texture of the American experience.\" And yet I (born in the United States more than half a century after Baldwin) continue to understand, because I have experienced in my own body the undimmed fury he felt about pervasive, limiting racism. In his writing there is a hunger for life, for all of it, and a strong wish to not be accounted nothing (a mere nigger, a mere neger ) when he knows himself to be so much. And this \"so much\" is neither a matter of ego about his writing nor an anxiety about his fame in New York or in Paris. It is about the incontestable fundamentals of a person: pleasure, sorrow, love, humor, and grief, and the complexity of the interior landscape that sustains those feelings. Baldwin was astonished that anyone anywhere should question these fundamentals, thereby burdening him with the supreme waste of time that is racism, let alone so many people in so many places. This unflagging ability to be shocked rises like steam off his written pages. \"The rage of the disesteemed is personally fruitless,\" he writes, \"but it is also absolutely inevitable.\"\n\nLeukerbad gave Baldwin a way to think about white supremacy from its first principles. It was as though he found it in its simplest form there. The men who suggested that he learn to ski so that they might mock him, the villagers who accused him behind his back of being a firewood thief, the ones who wished to touch his hair and suggested that he grow it out and make himself a winter coat, and the children who \"having been taught that the devil is a black man, scream in genuine anguish\" as he approached: Baldwin saw these as prototypes (preserved like coelacanths) of attitudes that had evolved into the more intimate, intricate, familiar, and obscene American forms of white supremacy that he already knew so well.\n\n* * *\n\nIt is a beautiful village. I liked the mountain air. But when I returned to my room from the thermal baths, or from strolling in the streets with my camera, I read the news online. There I found an unending sequence of crises: in the Middle East, in Africa, in Russia, and everywhere else, really. Pain was general. But within that larger distress was a set of linked stories, and thinking about \"Stranger in the Village,\" thinking with its help, was like injecting a contrast dye into my encounter with the news. The American police continued shooting unarmed black men, or killing them in other ways. The protests that followed, in black communities, were countered with violence by a police force that is becoming indistinguishable from an invading army. People began to see a connection between the various events: the shootings, the fatal choke hold, the stories of who was not given life-saving medication. And black communities were flooded with outrage and grief.\n\nIn all of this, a smaller, less significant story (but one that nevertheless signified ), caught my attention. The Mayor of New York and his police chief have a public-policy obsession with cleaning, with cleansing, and they decided that arresting members of the dance troupes that perform in moving subway cars is one of the ways to clean up the city. I read the excuses for this becoming a priority: some people fear being seriously injured by an errant kick (it has not happened, but they sure fear it), some people consider it a nuisance, some policymakers believe that going after misdemeanors is a way of preëmpting major crimes. And so, to combat this menace of dancers, the police moved in. They began chasing, and harassing, and handcuffing. The \"problem\" was dancers, and the dancers were, for the most part, black boys. The newspapers took the same tone as the government: a sniffy dismissal of the performers. And yet these same dancers are a bright spark in the day, a moment of unregulated beauty, artists with talents unimaginable to their audience. What kind of thinking would consider their abolition an improvement in city life? No one considers Halloween trick-or-treaters a public menace. There's no law enforcement against people selling Girl Scout cookies or against Jehovah's Witnesses. But the black body comes pre-judged, and as a result it is placed in needless jeopardy. To be black is to bear the brunt of selective enforcement of the law, and to inhabit a psychic unsteadiness in which there is no guarantee of personal safety. You are a black body first, before you are a kid walking down the street or a Harvard professor who has misplaced his keys.\n\nWilliam Hazlitt, in an 1821 essay entitled \"The Indian Jugglers,\" wrote words that I think of when I see a great athlete or dancer: \"Man, thou art a wonderful animal, and thy ways past finding out! Thou canst do strange things, but thou turnest them to little account!-To conceive of this effort of extraordinary dexterity distracts the imagination and makes admiration breathless.\" In the presence of the admirable, some are breathless not with admiration but with rage. They object to the presence of the black body (an unarmed boy in a street, a man buying a toy, a dancer in the subway, a bystander) as much as they object to the presence of the black mind. And simultaneous with these erasures is the unending collection of profit from black labor. Throughout the culture, there are imitations of the gait, bearing, and dress of the black body, a vampiric \"everything but the burden\" co-option of black life.\n\n* * *\n\nLeukerbad is ringed by mountains: the Daubenhorn, the Torrenthorn, the Rinderhorn. A high mountain pass called the Gemmi, another twenty-eight hundred feet above the village, connects the canton of Valais with the Bernese Oberland. Through this landscape-craggy, bare in places and verdant elsewhere, a textbook instance of the sublime-one moves as though through a dream. The Gemmipass is famous for good reason, and Goethe was there, as were Byron, Twain, and Picasso. The pass is mentioned in a Sherlock Holmes adventure, when Holmes crosses it on his way to the fateful meeting with Professor Moriarty at Reichenbach Falls. There was bad weather the day I went up, rain and fog, but it was good luck, as it meant I was alone on the trails. While there, I remembered a story that Lucien Happersberger told about Baldwin going out on a hike in these mountains. Baldwin had lost his footing during the ascent, and the situation was precarious for a moment. But Happersberger, who was an experienced climber, reached out a hand, and Baldwin was saved. It was out of this frightening moment, this appealingly biblical moment, that Baldwin got the title for the book he had been struggling to write: \"Go Tell It On the Mountain.\"\n\nIf Leukerbad was his mountain pulpit, the United States was his audience. The remote village gave him a sharper view of what things looked like back home. He was a stranger in Leukerbad, Baldwin wrote, but there was no possibility for blacks to be strangers in the United States, nor for whites to achieve the fantasy of an all-white America purged of blacks. This fantasy about the disposability of black life is a constant in American history. It takes a while to understand that this disposability continues. It takes whites a while to understand it; it takes non-black people of color a while to understand it; and it takes some blacks, whether they've always lived in the U.S. or are latecomers like myself, weaned elsewhere on other struggles, a while to understand it. American racism has many moving parts, and has had enough centuries in which to evolve an impressive camouflage. It can hoard its malice in great stillness for a long time, all the while pretending to look the other way. Like misogyny, it is atmospheric. You don't see it at first. But understanding comes.\n\n\"People who shut their eyes to reality simply invite their own destruction, and anyone who insists on remaining in a state of innocence long after that innocence is dead turns himself into a monster.\" The news of the day (old news, but raw as a fresh wound) is that black American life is disposable from the point of view of policing, sentencing, economic policy, and countless terrifying forms of disregard. There is a vivid performance of innocence, but there's no actual innocence left. The moral ledger remains so far in the negative that we can't even get started on the question of reparations. Baldwin wrote \"Stranger in the Village\" more than sixty years ago. Now what?\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Heard but Not Seen\n\nAway from home, I walk into unfamiliar spaces with my shoulders hunched and tight. Instinctively, I scan my surroundings, stretching every sense around the corners of the room until it feels safe. What the eye see? What the ears hear? What the nose smell?\n\nIt's Sunday afternoon and Toups South, a restaurant serving \"regional southern cuisine\" in the Lower Garden District of New Orleans, is mostly empty. A handful of patrons sit at the bar and at a smattering of tables. Everyone's white: the patrons, the hostess, the bartenders. In the open kitchen I see the only other Black person there, a brother working over the stove. But I'm hot and hungry and the restaurant smells like what I've selfishly been looking for; I'm down South and I want to eat Southern food.\n\nMy shoulders relax as I skim the menu; then I hear Q-Tip's familiar voice over the speakers, rapping \"but you stuck here nigga.\" And just like that my shoulders rise right back up again, bound by a familiar string of tension. I order a drink and try to relax again, try those familiar incantations that get you to release that energy, but it's too late-I'm taken out.\n\nThe song is \"The Space Program,\" from A Tribe Called Quest's 2016 album, We Got It From Here ... Thank You 4 Your Service , which spans Trump, gentrification, immigration, and the loss of Phife Dawg. As I drink my fancy Old-Fashioned and order a fried chicken sandwich, Tribe drips right into more songs I know by Outkast, Jay-Z, and Frank Ocean. A track from Beyonce's Lemonade is followed by Kendrick Lamar's \"Alright,\" songs born out of mainstream Black artists' return to conscious conversations about the Black American experience. But here it still feels unconscious, disconnected, and I too feel disconnected, a part of me seeing everyone in here experiencing the music: patrons occasionally singing along with little snatches of lyrics, the bartenders' heads bopping as they mix drinks, the chefs in the center island chopping to the beat. And here I am, Black and alone in the restaurant, watching it all with a mix of horror and fascination.\n\nThis morning on my Lyft ride into the city, as we rolled past the Superdome and the sites of projects demolished after the storm, Pat, my driver, schooled me on the artists who made the city's hip-hop scene: the names he knew that I'd know-Lil Wayne, Mystikal, 504 Boyz, Cash Money Millionaires-and then the names no one knew enough of now, now that so much has been wiped away, artists like Soulja Slim and C-Murder. We talked about how much of the music scene here was self-made in cars and homes, on blocks and corners. The low-budget album covers and big beats and boasts all felt living-room-made, as if they'd been recorded and immediately brought to listeners now , with no intervening processing and focus-grouping for wider audiences.\n\n\"But the culture's gone now,\" Pat said, and I get it as I sit at the restaurant bar, like I really get it; there's so much about Black people that's literally and figuratively gone in this city. On the restaurant's and its chef's Instagram profiles, the words they use to describe this buttermilk chicken sandwich and the other food on the menu- reimagined , innovative , based in tradition -now strike a funny chord in a city of self-made Black artists whose communities don't have much of a chance to reimagine or innovate in this newer New Orleans. It's notable that this playlist doesn't feature those New Orleans artists Pat discussed with me, or even-if you want to talk about recycling and innovation-Mos Def's \"Katrina Clap,\" which samples Juvenile's \"Nolia Clap,\" or the Legendary K.O.'s \"George Bush Doesn't Care About Black People,\" leaning on Kanye's \"Gold Digger.\" Instead it's a playlist filled with people like Biggie and Jay-Z, with a sprinkle of Wu. I think a track or two from the Internet make an appearance. All of it feels familiar and fine; I mean, they're artists on about 1,000 playlists that I've made myself. But it's jarring to hear them here in the middle of this restaurant. It's not just their presence as Black artists; they're not even local ones, or ones with deep connections to NOLA. I get the \"cool\" the restaurant's going for; it's the type that infiltrates sneaker shops and some trendy fashion stores. Yet in those spaces, the aesthetics and the culture are in concert with one another. Here it feels like costume-or maybe, I guess, an apron. The foregrounding of this playlist and its absence of NOLA artists feels messy-best to wipe your hands of it all.\n\nI don't have to travel to New Orleans to experience hip-hop as a soundtrack to gentrification and displacement. On a corner in my Philadelphia neighborhood, Graduate Hospital, a once-Black-owned all-hours neighborhood bar was bought out and eventually replaced by a white-owned taqueria. On any given night you can hear Black music playing in the restaurant, almost as if they were phantoms of the old owners and clientele. You've undoubtedly heard Solange's \"Cranes in the Sky\" while shopping at a fancy boutique in the heart of a city, Blood Orange's \"Charcoal Baby\" in a chic coffee shop adorned with hip baristas in knit caps. Now that hip-hop is no longer seen as a threat, the way it was when I was growing up in the '80s and '90s, it's become the default ambiance in the kinds of high-end spaces that include few Black people.\n\nWhen I enter one of these spaces I understand, in my bones, the weight of that displacement. I start looking around Philadelphia and seeing a city that's gradually cordoning off the Black community with bars with coded dress requirements and expensive homes that few can afford. Not long after some new homes were built near Broad and South streets, new neighbors started complaining about the live reggae music that's long been featured in the backyard of the Jamaican Jerk Hut, a city staple. Not long after, summer beer gardens started popping up around the city, with one of the first built flush against the Jerk Hut. On summer nights you can now hear hip-hop with your craft beer, as suddenly loud music's no longer an inconvenience and Center City continues to hollow itself out.\n\nAt a Flywheel gym in Center City, the Saturday class theme is \"Lizzo,\" and so for 45 minutes we drive our bodies into grime to a playlist of Lizzo songs. It's me and a coterie of largely young white women, clad in workout Lycra, hair tightly wound, lips pressed or teeth gnashed, hunched over a squadron of bikes. All around me the cyclists are rapturously singing along to this Black woman who has become the latest familiar avatar for white women, with her unbridled confidence, her beauty, and her liberated sound. Near the front of the semicircle arena, where we stationary stormtroopers attempt to bike in unison, one woman is so passionately engaged she looks more like she's at church than at the gym. And as I pedal, I am watching her and her athleisure-wearing counterparts whip their bodies to songs by this large Black woman.\n\nIt took me out. How inviting are these spaces for Black women? How often do these companies' Instagram feeds highlight Black women's stories-of beauty, of power, of confidence, of independence, of camaraderie? And how has the music of Black women become a kind of sonic drill sergeant for a mostly white group of cyclists who turn these Black women into their avatars, costuming themselves in their personas and music in a way that cheapens and flattens them? Flywheel itself is more like a macabre megachurch; as the miked instructor bellows to the flock, you're asked to give your body up to something bigger, and the music is meant to fuel this transformation each week. These hip-hop songs become hymnals to the body temple, tools to assist with punishing and improving the body, making it better, able to endure more and more.\n\nA white friend said that Black culture is American culture, and that the two are, as a result, linked. True. And yet that's what makes it all the more painful to find myself in mostly white spaces with their Black soundtracks, doing something intimate like eating with a friend, doing something public like shopping or working out-always in a place that's using that music not only to create a vibe but a communal experience for their customers. The music's been recycled for consumption, with little care for the context of this consumption. Embracing Black music is not the same as embracing Black people, after all, no matter how often our music is created with a specific gaze toward our experience. How many times, while our music plays, have one of us been dismissed, followed, or harassed in these spaces? What was playing when those two brothers were being kicked out of a Philadelphia Starbucks ? On the loudspeakers and PA systems in stadiums, as hip-hop music blasts to keep the crowd hyped, and celebrate big plays, Black men and women tie on aprons and stand behind concession stands, walk the rows and aisles, sweep the floors-even as a nation denounces players' rights to kneel in protest. It's as if the music gets to stand in for us. Increasingly we're in the background as our music is pushed to the fore.\n\nMy nana, Alice, and her best friend Ms. Sarah were two Black women among many who worked the assembly line at a General Motors factory back in Trenton, New Jersey. They wore their bodies down making cars that it would take them years to afford themselves, and I imagine them singing Tina, Aretha, the Supremes to get through hourslong shifts. How those anthems of Black homes, Black marriage, Black communities, Black love, Black sex, Black strength fell in lockstep with their lives! Now that's all been replaced; the factories and homes and communities have gone away, often literally replaced by boutiques and upscale restaurants and Flywheels. Yet the music remains. As Tina, Aretha, and the Supremes have been replaced by Rihanna, Cardi, and Beyonce, so have the bodies. I once spent a summer as a high schooler working alongside Nana; now I'm an adult in the city, a Black man pedaling in the dark, alone with these rows of white bodies and Lizzo's joyous, lonely voice.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Many Faces of Timothée Chalamet\n\nIn the wake of a tentative ( and since-ratified ) SAG-AFTRA deal, Timothée Chalamet and his disarmingly angular visage kicked into publicity high gear and swung by 30 Rockefeller Plaza last month to host Saturday Night Live in the run-up to his latest film project, Paul King's highly anticipated musical blockbuster Wonka . It was the actor's second time up at bat in the famed studio, and his monologue opened with the standard trappings of Lorne Michaels' legacy program: canned, self-effacing jokes with pauses built in for applause, mildly pointed observations about contemporary celebrity affairs, and a campy yet gracious nod-via a kitschy musical number, Willy Wonka cane included-to the shameless circuit of press and self-promotion that NBC milks in order to wrangle Hollywood's biggest for an hour of sketch comedy each week.\n\nSometime after the asides shouting out Fandango discount codes ( damnhughgrantgotthatoompaloompadumptruck , in case you were wondering) and gesturing at A.I.-generated crowds, the melody makes a hard pivot: The melancholy piano of \"Pure Imagination\" is exchanged for a scattershot imitation trap beat, and SNL cast member Marcello Hernandez joins Chalamet onstage, where they rap about being adults with baby faces. It's a jocular performance reminiscent of SNL 's Lonely Island era -one where the joke is partially in the catchiness and in the commitment to the absurdity of the record, but also in the fundamental hypebeast-tinged irreverence to the hip-hop art form that makes the parody seem so amusing. Partway through, Punkie Johnson joins the duo, donning a vivid fuchsia wig from Spirit Halloween, in a clear homage to Nicki Minaj's Barbie persona in likeness and in animated rapping intonations, although not in lyrical capacity; Kenan Thompson also comes in to round out the group as the ditty comes to a close, with a quick series of couplets on how his face has remained the same from his Kenan & Kel days.\n\nThe reaction to the midperformance switch was mixed, ranging from genuine amusement to bewilderment that veered on being mildly affronted , especially on behalf of the Pink Friday 2 rapper. But the rap parody is not, we can assume, just a desperate attempt to rile up Minaj's Barbz. Rather, it is a cheeky-albeit poorly executed-nod to a distinct part of Chalamet's persona and history: \"Timmy Tim,\" the actor's rap alter ego, as famously documented 11 years ago on the stage of the prestigious Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts in New York. Before he was nabbing Academy Award nominations and hanging out with the likes of Luca Guadagnino, Noah Baumbach, and Greta Gerwig, Chalamet was emulating Nicki Minaj -a fellow LaGuardia alum- and other rappers , busting out his own choreography , and throwing himself into not just consuming but actively participating in Black culture. (\"What's wrong with that kid, does he think that he's Black?\" he quips in a particularly rowdy high school performance.)\n\n\"Timmy Tim\" remains a key part of Chalamet's lore-and his public image. His appeal as a celebrity is a high-wire act, balancing his boyish charm with his high ceiling as a thespian and his hypebeast enthusiasm for Black culture. Much of Chalamet's early press and charm was framed around his casual proximity to urban cool-he would speak about living in the Bronx, rap Cardi B lyrics , openly acknowledge his former rap \"alter ego\" on late-night shows, and make references to a much-memed \"Statistics\" rap of his that, by my estimation, seemed to be made exclusively to bring Lin-Manuel Miranda to tears. His ability to traverse in and out of a \"swag\" aesthetic at will was endlessly exciting to a buttoned-up press corps easily titillated by the slightest aberration. There was a near-breathy fascination with the fact that the first album he ever bought was 50 Cent's Get Rich or Die Tryin' at age 7 or 8. (His sister persuaded their mom to let him buy the explicit version from Tower Records.) Which Ye lyric would he be caught rapping along to next during a film promo run? Which A-list rapper collective would he manage to get invited to dinner with and enthusiastically report on for the late-night circuit? It was befuddling and thrilling to interviewers and hosts that Chalamet not only engaged in the space of \"Black cool\" but sought to be included. What might have just been a fun fact-and, indeed, it seems as if he's genuinely just having fun, whether he's talking about his hip-hop dancing skills or caught kicking back at a now-viral cookout -became an inextricable part of the Timothée Chalamet package, a dichotomy that fans and magazines alike could reach for when championing the actor as unique and different, a rare diamond in the rough.\n\nThe best of movies, TV, books, music, and more, delivered to your inbox.\n\nBut this dichotomy-the mystique of this chic thespian whose command of the French language and dizzyingly sharp facial structure are indicative of his cosmopolitan flair, while also happening to be bohemian enough to vibe at a cookout-works only if you view art and cinema as diametrically opposed to hip-hop, urban cool, and Black culture. To those who continue to separate the indie film scene from the height of Complex Magazine's heyday, Chalamet may confound and defy expectations. What that framework misses, however, are two simple truths: For one, Blackness has been part of the cultural conversation, to the point where there isn't a music critic around who couldn't tell you about the sea of white, avowed Kid Cudi fans who were faithful acolytes of his Man on the Moon era-like Chalamet, now a close friend of the rapper's, is. Furthermore, Chalamet is not just a French auteur artboi who looks plucked straight out of a Baroque painting, nor is he a just a so-called \" swag-era millennial \" riding the penetration of Black urban trends into mainstream cool: He's a lifelong New Yorker, a product of the Theater District's Manhattan Plaza (the same building where Alicia Keys grew up), the famed arts program at LaGuardia High School, and New York University. \"Just like with acting, you have to grow up quickly in New York,\" he said in an interview early on in his career. \"It helped me with my poise. And it gave me the ability to be calm on set at 16: I could go into my own world and not be fazed by everything going on around me.\"\n\nIt is Chalamet's metropolitan-influenced upbringing, coupled with his proximity to the arts and urban trends, that is key to understanding his celebrity fame. He has most successfully managed to meld all sides of himself in his sartorial sensibilities, which have ranged from sequin-forward formalwear and a high-low approach to the Met Gala ( who could forget the white Chucks?) to a standard, if somewhat pedestrian, approach to streetwear in general: joggers, Supreme tees, and a sneaker, albeit generally paired with a stunning (in aesthetic and sticker price) Cartier panther watch. At his most casual, even with the expensive adornments and fashion partnerships, Chalamet is fairly indistinguishable from the average recent NYU grad, clinging to life in lower Manhattan and a watered-down approach to Black urban trends.\n\nThe dual sides of Chalamet's public persona-his proximity to an aesthetic edginess-helped build his fame and his fan base, but recent reactions to his SNL rap and to his dating life show the tenuousness of the tightrope that he must walk. The news that the actor is seemingly dating Kylie Jenner-yes, of the Kardashian clan-deconstructs that mirage of Chalamet as elevated ingenue and/or bohemian, hip-hop-loving cookout guest. A current scroll through Chalamet's Instagram comments requires wading through waist-deep levels of malice, even now, months since the reported relationship came to light: \"That family will be your downfall\"; \"I didn't know you liked plastic so much\"; \"I REFUSE TO BELIEVE UR DATING KYLIE\"; \"your career will bomb for this hope plastic was worth it.\" The level of vitriol is not merely irrational-it is also being fed by the media. Early reports in W Magazine asserted that \"someone out there (Kris Jenner?) really wants us to believe this coupling is for real. Despite them both being very famous twentysomethings, they come from extremely different worlds\"-a pointed choice of words that fueled rumors that this was a \"PR relationship\" (one of the most misused conspiracies in pop-culture discussions, next to \"industry plant\" and \"woke mob\").\n\n\"Extremely different worlds\"? If nothing else, Jenner and Chalamet share an affinity as young, white celebrities who are unsubtle about their interest in Black cultural aesthetics. It would also be prudent to remember that the famed Kid Cudi birthday party photo that featured Chalamet chucking up the peace sign next to Cudi, Kanye West, and Pete Davidson was taken by fellow A-list guest Kim Kardashian, Jenner's sister; the alleged couple's circles have encroached upon each other for years, even if it may not have been all that obvious to outsiders. Gone are the days when we could perpetuate the absurd urban legend that the Kardashian-Jenner family are bewitching sirens, leaving destruction and men helpless to their temptations in their wake.

There's something peculiar about certain fans' open revulsion at Chalamet acting like many people his age do, as if he is supposed to embody somebody more mature than he has ever declared he was, merely because of the projects he has been attached to.

      "text": "The Many Faces of Timothée Chalamet\n\nIn the wake of a tentative ( and since-ratified ) SAG-AFTRA deal, Timothée Chalamet and his disarmingly angular visage kicked into publicity high gear and swung by 30 Rockefeller Plaza last month to host Saturday Night Live in the run-up to his latest film project, Paul King's highly anticipated musical blockbuster Wonka . It was the actor's second time up at bat in the famed studio, and his monologue opened with the standard trappings of Lorne Michaels' legacy program: canned, self-effacing jokes with pauses built in for applause, mildly pointed observations about contemporary celebrity affairs, and a campy yet gracious nod-via a kitschy musical number, Willy Wonka cane included-to the shameless circuit of press and self-promotion that NBC milks in order to wrangle Hollywood's biggest for an hour of sketch comedy each week.\n\nSometime after the asides shouting out Fandango discount codes ( damnhughgrantgotthatoompaloompadumptruck , in case you were wondering) and gesturing at A.I.-generated crowds, the melody makes a hard pivot: The melancholy piano of \"Pure Imagination\" is exchanged for a scattershot imitation trap beat, and SNL cast member Marcello Hernandez joins Chalamet onstage, where they rap about being adults with baby faces. It's a jocular performance reminiscent of SNL 's Lonely Island era -one where the joke is partially in the catchiness and in the commitment to the absurdity of the record, but also in the fundamental hypebeast-tinged irreverence to the hip-hop art form that makes the parody seem so amusing. Partway through, Punkie Johnson joins the duo, donning a vivid fuchsia wig from Spirit Halloween, in a clear homage to Nicki Minaj's Barbie persona in likeness and in animated rapping intonations, although not in lyrical capacity; Kenan Thompson also comes in to round out the group as the ditty comes to a close, with a quick series of couplets on how his face has remained the same from his Kenan & Kel days.\n\nThe reaction to the midperformance switch was mixed, ranging from genuine amusement to bewilderment that veered on being mildly affronted , especially on behalf of the Pink Friday 2 rapper. But the rap parody is not, we can assume, just a desperate attempt to rile up Minaj's Barbz. Rather, it is a cheeky-albeit poorly executed-nod to a distinct part of Chalamet's persona and history: \"Timmy Tim,\" the actor's rap alter ego, as famously documented 11 years ago on the stage of the prestigious Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts in New York. Before he was nabbing Academy Award nominations and hanging out with the likes of Luca Guadagnino, Noah Baumbach, and Greta Gerwig, Chalamet was emulating Nicki Minaj -a fellow LaGuardia alum- and other rappers , busting out his own choreography , and throwing himself into not just consuming but actively participating in Black culture. (\"What's wrong with that kid, does he think that he's Black?\" he quips in a particularly rowdy high school performance.)\n\n\"Timmy Tim\" remains a key part of Chalamet's lore-and his public image. His appeal as a celebrity is a high-wire act, balancing his boyish charm with his high ceiling as a thespian and his hypebeast enthusiasm for Black culture. Much of Chalamet's early press and charm was framed around his casual proximity to urban cool-he would speak about living in the Bronx, rap Cardi B lyrics , openly acknowledge his former rap \"alter ego\" on late-night shows, and make references to a much-memed \"Statistics\" rap of his that, by my estimation, seemed to be made exclusively to bring Lin-Manuel Miranda to tears. His ability to traverse in and out of a \"swag\" aesthetic at will was endlessly exciting to a buttoned-up press corps easily titillated by the slightest aberration. There was a near-breathy fascination with the fact that the first album he ever bought was 50 Cent's Get Rich or Die Tryin' at age 7 or 8. (His sister persuaded their mom to let him buy the explicit version from Tower Records.) Which Ye lyric would he be caught rapping along to next during a film promo run? Which A-list rapper collective would he manage to get invited to dinner with and enthusiastically report on for the late-night circuit? It was befuddling and thrilling to interviewers and hosts that Chalamet not only engaged in the space of \"Black cool\" but sought to be included. What might have just been a fun fact-and, indeed, it seems as if he's genuinely just having fun, whether he's talking about his hip-hop dancing skills or caught kicking back at a now-viral cookout -became an inextricable part of the Timothée Chalamet package, a dichotomy that fans and magazines alike could reach for when championing the actor as unique and different, a rare diamond in the rough.\n\nThe best of movies, TV, books, music, and more, delivered to your inbox.\n\nBut this dichotomy-the mystique of this chic thespian whose command of the French language and dizzyingly sharp facial structure are indicative of his cosmopolitan flair, while also happening to be bohemian enough to vibe at a cookout-works only if you view art and cinema as diametrically opposed to hip-hop, urban cool, and Black culture. To those who continue to separate the indie film scene from the height of Complex Magazine's heyday, Chalamet may confound and defy expectations. What that framework misses, however, are two simple truths: For one, Blackness has been part of the cultural conversation, to the point where there isn't a music critic around who couldn't tell you about the sea of white, avowed Kid Cudi fans who were faithful acolytes of his Man on the Moon era-like Chalamet, now a close friend of the rapper's, is. Furthermore, Chalamet is not just a French auteur artboi who looks plucked straight out of a Baroque painting, nor is he a just a so-called \" swag-era millennial \" riding the penetration of Black urban trends into mainstream cool: He's a lifelong New Yorker, a product of the Theater District's Manhattan Plaza (the same building where Alicia Keys grew up), the famed arts program at LaGuardia High School, and New York University. \"Just like with acting, you have to grow up quickly in New York,\" he said in an interview early on in his career. \"It helped me with my poise. And it gave me the ability to be calm on set at 16: I could go into my own world and not be fazed by everything going on around me.\"\n\nIt is Chalamet's metropolitan-influenced upbringing, coupled with his proximity to the arts and urban trends, that is key to understanding his celebrity fame. He has most successfully managed to meld all sides of himself in his sartorial sensibilities, which have ranged from sequin-forward formalwear and a high-low approach to the Met Gala ( who could forget the white Chucks?) to a standard, if somewhat pedestrian, approach to streetwear in general: joggers, Supreme tees, and a sneaker, albeit generally paired with a stunning (in aesthetic and sticker price) Cartier panther watch. At his most casual, even with the expensive adornments and fashion partnerships, Chalamet is fairly indistinguishable from the average recent NYU grad, clinging to life in lower Manhattan and a watered-down approach to Black urban trends.\n\nThe dual sides of Chalamet's public persona-his proximity to an aesthetic edginess-helped build his fame and his fan base, but recent reactions to his SNL rap and to his dating life show the tenuousness of the tightrope that he must walk. The news that the actor is seemingly dating Kylie Jenner-yes, of the Kardashian clan-deconstructs that mirage of Chalamet as elevated ingenue and/or bohemian, hip-hop-loving cookout guest. A current scroll through Chalamet's Instagram comments requires wading through waist-deep levels of malice, even now, months since the reported relationship came to light: \"That family will be your downfall\"; \"I didn't know you liked plastic so much\"; \"I REFUSE TO BELIEVE UR DATING KYLIE\"; \"your career will bomb for this hope plastic was worth it.\" The level of vitriol is not merely irrational-it is also being fed by the media. Early reports in W Magazine asserted that \"someone out there (Kris Jenner?) really wants us to believe this coupling is for real. Despite them both being very famous twentysomethings, they come from extremely different worlds\"-a pointed choice of words that fueled rumors that this was a \"PR relationship\" (one of the most misused conspiracies in pop-culture discussions, next to \"industry plant\" and \"woke mob\").\n\n\"Extremely different worlds\"? If nothing else, Jenner and Chalamet share an affinity as young, white celebrities who are unsubtle about their interest in Black cultural aesthetics. It would also be prudent to remember that the famed Kid Cudi birthday party photo that featured Chalamet chucking up the peace sign next to Cudi, Kanye West, and Pete Davidson was taken by fellow A-list guest Kim Kardashian, Jenner's sister; the alleged couple's circles have encroached upon each other for years, even if it may not have been all that obvious to outsiders. Gone are the days when we could perpetuate the absurd urban legend that the Kardashian-Jenner family are bewitching sirens, leaving destruction and men helpless to their temptations in their wake. Treating Chalamet as a victim or a prop to be used is no less ridiculous. (He has faced these allegations before, with former girlfriend Lily-Rose Depp: \"And then people are like, 'This is a PR stunt.' A PR stunt?!\" he told Elle . \"Do you think I'd want to look like that in front of all of you?!\") Fans' active rejection of what likely may amount to his very real feelings-even if it is a fleeting romance, which he has every right to-shouldn't prompt such an outsized reaction under the guise of protecting their favorite artist's career interests.\n\nIn a 2018 GQ interview , Chalamet described his approach to acting roles as \"less a transformation of character ... and more capturing a feeling ... a synchronization, a flow. Of being able to communicate by thought.\" While he was referring to his actions on set, there's a symbolism to the level of recoil his once-adoring public has had to Chalamet doing nothing more than simply existing as himself and going with the flow, as it were (the flow, of course, being highly curated celebrity). There's something peculiar about certain fans' open revulsion at Chalamet acting like many people his age do, as if he is supposed to embody somebody more mature than he has ever declared he was, merely because of the projects he has been attached to. Because he has played the tender teenager in Call Me by Your Name , the aching kindred soul in Little Women , the hurting son in Beautiful Boy , must he necessarily be held to the same expectations as the characters he plays?\n\nThis is part of a philosophical conversation about not just fandom but how the relationship between art and artist has continued to evolve under the gaze of today's viewer, particularly when it comes to on-screen performances. Cultural commentators and fans alike increasingly use shorthand such as \"such-and-such actor is playing themselves\"-or, rather, what we believe is a heightened version of their personas, cobbled together from scraps of media and roles and assumptions-and it has completely blunted these distinctions over time. After the implication of actors such as Kevin Spacey, James Franco, and other accused perpetrators of misconduct in the #MeToo movement , backlash to any equivocation over separating the art from the artist based on moral grounds has misguidedly evolved into rendering the artist and their art inextricable on all levels-if an actor plays a specific kind of role, whether it be sweet, affected, disenchanted, devilish, charming, or erudite, it has somehow become insightful to their off-screen behavior as well, should they ever be mired in any sort of controversy or reproachable behavior. And if a socialite known for dating Black men crosses the threshold of someone known for their proximity to prestige films, all signs thusly indicate that their worlds cannot possibly collide. Strike me if you've heard this one before, but an artist's ability to evoke a story is occasionally separate from their leisurely interests.\n\nUltimately, whether Chalamet's alleged romance is \"real\" or not, or whether it has much lasting power, has very little relevance-what it does reveal, however, is the quickly constructed fan fictions we cling to, made of little more than viral movie clips and fan edits of curated moments and preferred versions of a celebrity. These twin acts of presumption and projection create a blinkered view of Chalamet, one wherein his relationship to Black cool is alternately trotted out as a party trick or dismissed as a minor inconvenience to be acknowledged semiannually at best, secondary to the evidently more enticing and satisfying narrative that is Chalamet as a sensitive, artistic soul-a conceit cobbled together largely from film reels.

      "text": "Black History Treasures\n\nListen to A Word ... With Jason Johnson:\n\nMany of us are planning a post-pandemic summer full of fun, travel, and catching up with our families. Particularly for Black Americans, the catastrophic losses of COVID-19 brought us a greater appreciation of how important it is to talk with elders to get a better understanding of our country, our families, and ourselves. But that wasn't news to Julieanna Richardson. She's the founder and president of The HistoryMakers, a project devoted to creating a video archive of notable Black Americans, with thousands of interviews already. Richardson has spoken to everyone from musical legend Quincy Jones, to late congressman and civil rights hero John Lewis. On Friday's episode of A Word , I spoke with Richardson about the HistoryMakers project and whether the pandemic has given her a greater sense of urgency about her work. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nJason Johnson: Has the pandemic given your work a greater sense of urgency?\n\nJulieanna Richardson: It definitely has, but I would also say that before COVID hit, I was increasingly concerned because I did not realize the fact that we don't have a lot of documentation of the 20th century. I don't think I knew that when I started the project. I wanted to document, in a massive way, our experience across a variety of disciplines. And so my concern was: Can we now do things over Zoom? So yes, we're very concerned about that, and also we've had a significant number of people dying.\n\nWhat are the kinds of things that Black America doesn't tend to have archived compared with, say, the white majority?\n\nWell, wholesale, the Black community is not archiving hardly anything. We all know the scrapbooks that people have, and we're in a time of social media, so people have Facebook. But social media cannot be confused with archives. I need to say that. But let me tell you, I would call it a crisis and I'll just take our body of interviews, which I would consider a pretty significant representative sample. Less than a fraction of 1 percent had any what we call \"plans for their papers.\" When I mention papers, I'm talking about letters, correspondences, emails, AV material, recordings, photographs, and reports. I knew that that was the case because I started to ask people what they were planning to do. And I would say to people, \"Oh well, why don't you check out this? There's the Schomburg [Center for Research Center in Black Culture], Amistad , the Howard Moorland-Spingarn [Research Center]. You should put your things someplace,\" and so that I did.\n\nThen when we were starting to get our digital archive, which is a searchable database, into colleges, and universities, and libraries. This was before George Floyd and COVID, so they're dismissive. And then to really try to engage in partnership, I started to ask them what they had about the Black experience and they didn't have anything, and that's when I panicked. Like, we are not being documented. And the 20th century is a really significant century because we had already lost the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries for the most part. Sometimes I don't sleep well.\n\nThrough HistoryMakers, you've talked to Colin Powell, Whoopi Goldberg, Quincy Jones, but you also talked to a lot of just regular folks. So give us an idea how you find the people that you want to talk to?\n\nWe were really trying to build a record of our achievements, and family histories, and more information about our culture. That doesn't always come with the big names. We're talking about memory. The other thing is that we were going across a variety of disciplines. So whether they were scientists-we were able to do Katherine Johnson way before her story was featured in Hidden Figures . And so we've been working now with advisory committees that are helping to better inform who we're doing. That is important. We're interested in the person, but we're really interested in the stories that reside inside of them.\n\nSo it's interesting you say that because you're not always focusing on the big, famous, greatest hits. During your conversation with Maya Angelou, she talked about meeting modern dance legend Alvin Ailey. Here's a clip from Angelou:\n\nWe met the way dancers meet in dance halls or in dance studios. So we put together a duo and we wore almost no clothes at all. I think I had a small, little G-string and two tassels on my breasts or something. And he wore a little G-string made out of cloth, like leopard print. And we both slathered our bodies down with Max Factor makeup, so we were greasy as lard.\n\nWow. When you hear stuff like that, I mean...do you write about it to yourself? Does this just make you the most fascinating dinner party guest ever? How do you feel when you hear these nuggets of history?\n\nWell, I think that I could make a fascinating dinner guest because we've learned so much. I want to say that what we do are really serious, oral histories. Our interviews last three to five hours a night. We go in with a research outline. What is so wonderful about that interview is that we think of this as the time before [Maya Angelou] becomes the writer, and we've been having discussions with our artists. Artists can merge between different categories. And so here she was, this is early Maya Angelou, when she is actually dancing, which gets lost in the whole telling of her story.\n\nHow did you get the inspiration to do this? I hear that it was a project that happened in grade school. What got you into archiving?\n\nThe inspiration came because I grew up in a small town in Ohio called Newark, Ohio, just south of Columbus. We had a thousand Blacks out of 50,000 whites, but I didn't know anything about Black people. The only thing we studied were about slavery and George Washington Carver and my 9-year-old brain could not compute how he could have done all those things with peanuts and white people were talking about it. When all we have been were slaves, it just didn't compute.\n\nOne day the teacher asked us to talk about our family background and everybody's hands, I mean, they shot up like arrows. They were twofers and threefers. Like, they were part-German, part-Italian, and I'm sitting there horrified. What am I? And I said, I don't even know what I said, Negro or colored. I'm not sure because it's not like... It's before \"Black and proud.\"\n\nAnd then I said I was Native American because everybody who is Black says that. Then I added in French because I didn't want to be left out. I thought she was looking at me like, \"Where did that come from?\" I felt like a fraud. And that feeling stayed with me until my sophomore year at Brandeis University, where I was a theater arts, American studies major, doing research on the Harlem Renaissance in New York at Schomburg Library. And I'm listening to a song from the 1921 production of Shuffle Along on Broadway called \"I'm Just Wild About Harry,\" thinking that song had to be written by a white songwriting team, but it was written by a Black songwriting team, Noble Sissle and Eubie Blake. You talk about a bingo moment. I was in my element and being helped by the famous librarian Jean Hutson. She'd given me a list of people.\n\nI went and interviewed Butterfly McQueen and Leigh Whipper, who was the oldest living Black actor at the time, and Dick Campbell, who was legendary in Black theater circles, and John Henrik Clarke, a famous historian, and tap dancer Honi Coles. I mean, I have found myself... and even at that point, I probably didn't know that would be my life's passion.\n\nYou also worked in television, you went to Harvard. Do you think all those things, did they give you the skill set to eventually make HistoryMakers? Or do you think that was part of your personal exploration?\n\nVery much so. My father often would say before he passed that I ended up doing exactly what I wanted to do, so I'm storytelling. Theater is storytelling and American studies is about the United States. All roads have led me to where I am now, and everything I've put behind this initiative, it came to me really when I was without a job and confused about where I wanted to go next, and those stories came back to me. I was also in my mid-40s and not having had children, and you get to the point where you start thinking about what your legacy is going to be, what your leave behind is, and all those things led me to this.\n\nSpeaking of Harvard, in 2001, about a year after you started the project, you interviewed this young lawyer in Chicago named Barack Obama.\n\nDuring your conversation, he said, \"I think by the time I was an adolescent and had moved back from Indonesia and was struggling with these issues of racial identity and the father not being in the house, I reacted by engaging in a lot of behavior that's not untypical of Black males across the country.\"\n\nWhat made you want to interview this Barack Obama guy? I mean, he was just a state senator, and this is February of 2001. What made you think, \"I need to talk to this guy\"?\n\nBarack was interviewed as part of a project of someone who actually was known here as his godfather, but at that point that wasn't even on the horizon. It was early funding that we had gotten, and I wanted to trace the history of African Americans in the Illinois General Assembly. That turned out to be really a defining moment in many ways, besides us having had probably what is the earliest in-depth interview of him. But after he also had written his book, and you know, and I would say I've listened to the interview and it's remarkably consistent to the person we see today. I find that intriguing.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC. All rights reserved."

They were twofers and threefers. Like, they were part-German, part-Italian, and I'm sitting there horrified. What am I? And I said, I don't even know what I said, Negro or colored. I'm not sure because it's not like... It's before \"Black and proud.\"\n\nAnd then I said I was Native American because everybody who is Black says that. Then I added in French because I didn't want to be left out. I thought she was looking at me like, \"Where did that come from?\" I felt like a fraud. And that feeling stayed with me until my sophomore year at Brandeis University, where I was a theater arts, American studies major, doing research on the Harlem Renaissance in New York at Schomburg Library. And I'm listening to a song from the 1921 production of Shuffle Along on Broadway called \"I'm Just Wild About Harry,\" thinking that song had to be written by a white songwriting team, but it was written by a Black songwriting team, Noble Sissle and Eubie Blake. You talk about a bingo moment. I was in my element and being helped by the famous librarian Jean Hutson. She'd given me a list of people.\n\nI went and interviewed Butterfly McQueen and Leigh Whipper, who was the oldest living Black actor at the time, and Dick Campbell, who was legendary in Black theater circles, and John Henrik Clarke, a famous historian, and tap dancer Honi Coles. I mean, I have found myself... and even at that point, I probably didn't know that would be my life's passion.\n\nYou also worked in television, you went to Harvard. Do you think all those things, did they give you the skill set to eventually make HistoryMakers? Or do you think that was part of your personal exploration?\n\nVery much so. My father often would say before he passed that I ended up doing exactly what I wanted to do, so I'm storytelling. Theater is storytelling and American studies is about the United States. All roads have led me to where I am now, and everything I've put behind this initiative, it came to me really when I was without a job and confused about where I wanted to go next, and those stories came back to me. I was also in my mid-40s and not having had children, and you get to the point where you start thinking about what your legacy is going to be, what your leave behind is, and all those things led me to this.\n\nSpeaking of Harvard, in 2001, about a year after you started the project, you interviewed this young lawyer in Chicago named Barack Obama.\n\nDuring your conversation, he said, \"I think by the time I was an adolescent and had moved back from Indonesia and was struggling with these issues of racial identity and the father not being in the house, I reacted by engaging in a lot of behavior that's not untypical of Black males across the country.\"\n\nWhat made you want to interview this Barack Obama guy? I mean, he was just a state senator, and this is February of 2001. What made you think, \"I need to talk to this guy\"?\n\nBarack was interviewed as part of a project of someone who actually was known here as his godfather, but at that point that wasn't even on the horizon. It was early funding that we had gotten, and I wanted to trace the history of African Americans in the Illinois General Assembly. That turned out to be really a defining moment in many ways, besides us having had probably what is the earliest in-depth interview of him. But after he also had written his book, and you know, and I would say I've listened to the interview and it's remarkably consistent to the person we see today. I find that intriguing.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC. All rights reserved."

      "text": "How Black Is King Got Its African Lullabies\n\nIf you watch the credits of Beyoncé's visual album Black Is King and don't let Disney+ shunt you over to watching CGI big cats, you'll notice something interesting. Dotted among the songwriting credits for Beyoncé and her contemporary superstar collaborators from last summer's album are several tracks with names like \" Little Girls' Sung Games \" and \" Lullaby - Nzakara ,\" archival recordings of African folk music that date back to the mid-20 th century, capturing traditions that go back much longer. They're drawn from the UNESCO Collection of Traditional Music , a massive 127-album collection of recordings drawn from all over the world and released by Smithsonian Folkways. In a project explicitly dedicated to Beyoncé's son, Sir Carter, the recordings, many of which are lullabies, underline the way in which tradition is passed down through music (and, in one case, how that transmission can be exploited by outside parties for profit).\n\nFor insight into how those recordings came to be, and what Beyoncé is up to with them, we turned to ethnomusicologist Atesh Sonneborn, the retired associated director of Smithsonian Folkways, who oversaw the massive digital release of the UNESCO collection beginning in 2014.\n\nThe best of movies, TV, books, music, and more, delivered to your inbox three times a week.\n\nSam Adams: Looking over the recordings of African folk music included in Black Is King , they're all drawn from a period between the late 1950s and the early 1970s. Is there something special about that period of time?\n\nAtesh Sonneborn: There were a couple of things going on. One is an intense period of recording, but also an intense period of publication. People recorded and deposited those recordings in archives for years, and nothing was ever heard, but then there came a few record labels like Folkways and Ocora that put out stuff from all over the world. And they didn't find a huge audience, but they found an audience of people who really were fascinated by it-in some cases by the exoticism, and in some cases by the recognition.\n\nWhat's your own connection to this collection of music?\n\nIn the late '60s, early '70s, I used some of the music in a radio show I did for KPFK in Los Angeles about the history of Vietnam, and then I studied ethnomusicology at UCLA, where this becomes a really significant reference work, because there's so many music traditions at the village level that were recorded from the 1950s through the 1990s, when they were still whatever it means to be authentic.\n\nLooking at the tracks Beyoncé chose for Black Is King , do you see a connection between them?\n\nWhen I tried to reverse engineer how the search would occur to get these materials, I think I get it-the basics of it-although I can't figure out how they got to the Pete Seeger. I thought she was trying to do a couple of things. One was to reach back to her own sense of African heritage, which is, just because of the nature of being descended from slaves, you don't really know where your African heritage starts. So she reached into Central Africa and Western Africa, and I think she or somebody who was working for her went in for sounds, and they searched for lullabies, they searched for children's songs, and they searched for, again, a concept of authenticity. \"Who am I?\" The thing that's ethnomusicologically interesting is people finding themselves, finding their own identity in music.\n\nDo any of them stand out to you from an ethnomusicological perspective?\n\nI really personally like the way the Baka material goes, the Cameroonian lullaby , because they use a method of singing where each person has a note or two that comes at a certain point in the melodic line, and they only do it then. So it's both polyrhythmic and polyphonic. You know how English hand bells are, where they're doing \"Jingle Bells,\" and one person has \"jingle\"? That's the same concept, except in a very different kind of interlocking pattern. But for me, that was the coolest.\n\nMaybe the most substantial piece of music that's not Beyoncé's is the use of Solomon Linda's \" Mbube ,\" which eventually formed the basis for \" The Lion Sleeps Tonight ,\" although Linda originally got no credit and his family had to sue Disney to get paid for its use in The Lion King . That feels like a pointed reference to the historic exploitation of African and Black culture by the music industry, which is also something the largely white ethnographers who made these kinds of recordings were accused of. So has there been a reconsideration about the way this material was collected and used?\n\nOh, gosh, there's been reconsideration. It's ongoing. It's ongoing. And yeah, how to do that in a paragraph? Obviously, as we learned, I think, in seventh grade, the anthropologists went out and treated them as exotic other, didn't quite treat them as people, came back with their artifacts, their music. And no names were used, and maybe no money was exchanged. \"Do you mind if I record you?\" \"Well, no. We give our music. It's a gift from the gods. We give it to you.\" And OK, we take it back, and we publish it, and we make money, and we don't give you a dime. That, by the 1970s, was very much being challenged. And the idea of an ethnomusicological work being a collaboration. You know, not I know. You, the subject of what I'm trying to understand, you as a knower. I am not the knower. I can't do anything but faithfully trace what you know and share it. There's much, much more of that. And I think at this point there's been, over the past 30, 40 years, a number of significant moments where somebody in some place that is not a big urban center in Western culture said, \"Hey, that's my grandfather, and we never saw a dime.\" That's still going on.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Utopian and Dystopian Visions of Afrofuturism\n\nPhoto illustration by Lisa Larson-Walker. Photo by Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images, Sean Carter Photography via U Mich/ Flickr CC .\n\nThis article is part of Future Tense, a collaboration among Arizona State University , New America , and Slate . Future Tense explores the ways emerging technologies affect society, policy, and culture. On Thursday, Dec. 3, Future Tense will host \"Afrofuturism: Imagining the Future of Black Identity\" in New York. For more information and to RSVP, visit the New America website .\n\nAfrofuturism pioneers such as jazz musician Sun Ra-who walked around the streets of Chicago with custom-made electric space suits in the 1950s-and science fiction author Octavia Butler wouldn't have used the label Afrofuturism during their lifetimes, because it hadn't been invented yet. It wasn't in common parlance even a decade ago. As World Fantasy Award winner Nnedi Okorafor put it: \"My first novel was published in 2005 when I'd never heard the word. Now it's being retroactively labeled. Why?\"\n\nIn the early '90s, academic Mark Dery coined the term Afrofuturism to encompass a wide variety of creative explorations across numerous fields-music, art, film, and literature-over nearly a half-century in black culture. Afrofuturism is loosely marked by a passion for technology and innovation, as well as mysticism rooted in African-American and African culture. Narratives often feature black protagonists, and the aesthetic can draw upon design elements sourced from the rich traditions of the diaspora. Authors may reach back into the tribal histories of the Igbo , while mingling myths with spaceships or alien invasions.\n\nAfrofuturism-the idea, if not the word-appears to be bubbling up into the mainstream. National Book Award winner Ta-Nehisi Coates, for example, is writing an update of the Marvel comic book Black Panther , which was originally created by Stan Lee. Jaden Smith starred alongside his father Will Smith in 2013's After Earth . Neil de Grasse Tyson is the most popular astrophysicist on the planet today. While I write this, I'm drinking an IPA with a black superhero on the label and the fourth Lagos Comicon just wrapped in Nigeria.\n\nBut it's unclear whether Afrofuturism is taking permanent hold or whether science fiction is merely featuring a few additional cast members of color. If, like me, you grew up believing that characters like Lando Calrissian and Princess Leia would soon become commonplace in popular entertainment, you've learned that empowerment across racial, gender, and ethnic lines isn't guaranteed. (For instance, Will Smith was already a bankable star when he made After Earth -which wasn't exactly a roaring success .) There is a bright utopian vision of Afrofuturism, and a much bleaker dystopian possibility of exclusion from mainstream culture once again.\n\nYtasha Womack, author of the seminal work Afrofuturism: The World of Black Sci-Fi and Fantasy Culture , is upbeat about the movement. \"As people create more works and more spaces to share their work, growth will continue,\" she said. \"Ultimately, creating more intersections of thought and works will create a web of healing and inspiration that anyone can connect to and grow from.\"\n\nMaking the utopian vision come to fruition will require a few things. Lisa Lucas, publisher of the art and politics magazine Guernica , and a woman of color, says, \"There is this ever-growing, snowballing movement of people who are interested in alternate storytelling forms for writers of color and for readers of color.\" But she says the movement requires growth outside the creative spotlight, among what she calls \"administrators of color.\" These are the expediters who drive the business decisions surrounding entertainment-the producers, editors, and owners. Administrators of color would look to cultivate new audiences instead of relying on sales metrics that tend to exclude marginalized voices. The notion could be extended to the boardrooms of major publishing houses and studios, neglected spaces for advancing progressive causes.\n\nAfrofuturism will also thrive when writers immerse themselves in technology in their studies or in their work. Speculative fiction can succeed through narrative discipline and intellectual curiosity alone, while sci-fi subgenres like space opera tend to be written by engineers. It helps to know some physics when you're writing about a spaceship that is five kilometers long. Only about 1 percent of engineers at Facebook and Google are black Americans. And this has been my experience working in tech, too-meeting a black employee is like happening upon a crocus peeking through the snowmelt.\n\nA truly transformative Afrofuturism would find creators confronting prejudices within black culture. They would question laws that force LGBTQ writers to flee from Africa , or fight gender discrimination couched under arguments of tradition. It could become a liberation movement of the imagination for all people.\n\nThis utopian vision of Afrofuturism is enticing, but it hasn't arrived yet. Right now there are a number of very real challenges for Afrofuturism to overcome in order to take hold in mainstream culture.\n\nIn the dystopian vision, no one on the business end of creative industries-the agents, marketers, publishers, producers-takes risks on creators of color. Artists might be forced to revert to addressing explicitly black themes. \"We have to write a slave narrative,\" Lisa Lucas said, \"or a story about civil rights, a retelling of Rosa Parks, some kind of better understanding of what it was like in 1960 or 1830, or what it was like on a slave boat.\"\n\nIt's a mistake, too, to think that crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter, Indiegogo, and Patreon can solve the problem of structural exclusion. The impressive speculative fiction collection Long Hidden: Speculative Fiction From the Margins of History was created from a Kickstarter campaign. The volunteer-run Tumblr blog We Are Wakanda , which is named for the fictional African kingdom in Marvel's Black Panther series, publishes an incredible volume of content about black comics and science. Founder Lionel Queen recently launched an Indiegogo campaign to develop a new app to support underrepresented creators. It's a great idea, well worth supporting, but an Afrofuturism that relies upon crowdfunding to survive is dystopian. It means there's no sustainable investment.\n\nAfrofuturism also needs to overcome its geographic myopia. Nnedi Okarafor, one of the most prominent science fiction writers working today, said: \"My issue with Afrofuturism is that it has traditionally been based and rooted far too much in American culture.\" She champions what she calls \"Africa-based sci-fi.\" Authors such as Fred Strydom , Lauren Beukes , and Sarah Lotz are writing engaging fiction set on the continent. But it's dangerous to oversimplify this trend. To my knowledge, not a single black sci-fi writer has been published by a major publishing house in Africa, and most writers working in Africa-based sci-fi hail from South Africa or Nigeria-not coincidentally, the largest economies on the continent.\n\nThere are other threats to Afrofuturism, too. Safe online spaces could become mired in hate and vitriol. The recent controversy surrounding the Hugo Awards -one of the most prestigious awards for science fiction writing-shows that the \"administrators of color\" whom Lisa Lucas supports tend to be missing from sci-fi culture. In that distasteful example, white authors attempted to game the voting system to fight against the rise in sci-fi of nontraditional and marginalized voices, such as LGBTQ authors. (They did not succeed.)\n\nIn some ways, the new film Star Wars: The Force Awakens exemplifies both the utopian and dystopian visions of Afrofuturism. The film stars the black British actor John Boyega as Finn , reportedly a major character in the storyline. Boyega can inspire the next generation of black sci-fi actors, but none of the credited writers will become a role model for the next generation of black writers-they're all white .\n\nWhether you call it Afrofuturism or another name, creators of color have developed support networks to imagine their own futures, ones in which they have agency, intellect, and purpose. Something special is happening.\n\n\"Afrofuturism existed before it was called Afrofuturism,\" Ytasha Womack says, \"and it will always exist. It's a human desire to want to shape your present and future. It's a human desire to embrace the imagination.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

For African-Americans, those initiatives offered social and economic programs that helped many people stake a greater claim on full citizenship for the first time.\n\nThe exhibition, \" Claiming Citizenship: African Americans and New Deal Photography ,\" now at New York's Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, shows African-Americans taking advantage of opportunities that hadn't been available to them previously. \"You can see how during the New Deal the government was experimenting with the possibility that all citizens deserved education, deserved medical care, deserved food security,\" said exhibition curator Rickie Solinger.\n\nThe photos are drawn from the Library of Congress and the National Archives. Solinger said the Library of Congress photographs were taken by experienced photographers and tended to document the ravages of the Great Depression in order to build support for New Deal spending. The photos from the National Archives, she said, were taken mostly by anonymous photographers commissioned to show what that money was accomplishing.\n\nBeginner class in adult education, New Orleans, September 1936\n\nNational Archives\n\nNational Archives\n\nNational Archives\n\nThe programs were wide-ranging, addressing issues including literacy, employment, and health. The Works Progress Administration , the most famous of these programs, put millions of Americans to work, including many African-Americans. It also exposed African-Americans to federally funded art, theater, music, and writing programs.\n\nFor some African-Americans, these were gateways to achieving some of the most basic elements of citizenship, which had been illusive due to systemic racism and poverty. \"If you're living in a moment in the 1930s in which you're able for the first time to claim medical care or to be an adult and learn how to read ... or to buy land and live in decent housing for the first time, these are arguably the constituent arguments for citizenship,\" Solinger said.\n\nFor the way it empowered African-Americans, Solinger said that the New Deal era might be seen as a rehearsal for the civil rights movement. \"When you think chronologically, the children in these pictures could grow up to be the parents of the civil rights activists of the '60s, or the children could be participants in the civil rights movements themselves,\" Solinger said.\n\nNational Archives\n\nMarjory Collins/Library of Congress\n\nBut in the 1930s, the government had a long way to go before it would begin offering equal rights to all citizens. The New Deal, though a step forward for African-Americans, did little to address institutional inequality. \"If you look at those pictures, you almost never see settings that were integrated in any way. Work settings, health care settings, and educational settings were always segregated, and the New Deal programs did not challenge that,\" Solinger said.\n\n\"Claiming Citizenship\" is on display at the Schomburg Center until Jan. 4.\n\nEdwin Rosskam/Library of Congress\n\nJack Delano/Library of Congress\n\nArthur Rothstein/Library of Congress\n\nNational Archives\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nby Jenée Desmond-Harris\n\nThis year marks the 50th anniversary of sociologist-turned-US Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan's 1965 study, The Negro Family: The Case for National Action . Generally referred to as the Moynihan Report, it primarily blames black poverty on \"ghetto culture,\" failure to marry, and absent black fathers, in an analysis that was instantly controversial and is still debated today.\n\nBut the report's focus on t he weakening of the black nuclear family as the key explanation for racial inequality has largely fallen out of favor in academic circles. Why? Some believe liberal backlash against the report has had a chilling effect on research that focused on so-called \"cultural pathologies\" - versus structural issues - for problems faced by African Americans.\n\nBut University of Maryland sociologist Philip N. Cohen, author of The Family: Diversity, Inequality, and Social Change , says that's ridiculous. The shift in sociology to a \"new, less victim-blamey perspective\" about the black experience in America, Cohen wrote in a recent blog post , wasn't because liberal scholars were scared to look at black culture as a way to explain black poverty and inequality. Rather, he said, it was that they simply didn't agree those factors were the real problem.\n\nI spoke to Cohen about why he says the narrative about liberals stifling studies like Moynihan's doesn't make sense, and how it connects to modern-day complaints about \"political correctness.\"\n\nJenée Desmond-Harris: What's the origin of the idea that the backlash against the Moynihan Report scared people away from studying \"cultural explanations\" for black poverty and inequality, and why do you think it's wrong?\n\nPhilip N. Cohen: It's complicated, because Moynihan started his whole report saying we had hundreds of years of racial oppression that had brought us to the point he was writing at in 1965. But he went on to say that as of [that point], the main problem facing the black population was the problem of absent fathers, single mothers, and problems associated with nonstandard family structure.\n\nTo understand the reaction against it, you have to look back at what was happening in 1965: the Civil Rights Act, the transition to the black power era of the civil rights movement. ... There was a strong sense against victim-blaming attitudes already, and it crystallized among those criticizing Moynihan. It became a catalyst for people to latch onto.\n\nSo the idea that the liberal backlash squelched the report comes from the same sort of \"politically correct\" criticism of literature or of leftists that we have in academia today. The myth is the idea that the defenders of the black community were so vociferous and their criticism was so toxic that everyone steered away from asking hard questions like, \"What if black fathers were more responsible?\" and \"What if black couples stayed together?\"\n\n[Sociologist] Williams Julius Wilson introduced [his 1987 book] The Truly Disadvantaged by saying no one has wanted to talk about this since [the backlash against the Moynihan report in] the 1960s and \"liberal scholars shied away from researching behavior construed as unflattering or stigmatizing.\" That was a little bit of drama and hyperbole. It wasn't that people were afraid; it's that they didn't agree.\n\nThere was actually an explosion of research focused on black family resilience, extended families, and non-kin family networks that allowed people to survive in really harsh conditions, rather than beating up on people for not being married.\n\nJDH: You've said that the reason for this explosion of research wasn't a backlash against the Moynihan report and harsh academic critiques, but because \"history was actually happening then, too.\" What does this mean?\n\nPNC: For example, the picture I put on the blog was the Breakfast for Children program that the Black Panther Party did locally. The scholars who were focused on black family resilience were not acting out of reaction to Moynihan. What was really happening was a broad movement to empower local communities and community uplift ... that was very much an important part of the public and political discourse. The scholars who went out into communities and started writing books like All Our Kin [Carol B. Stack's 1983 book that ran counter to Moynihan's research], their work was informed by that, and they looked for ways that poor people - people in really highly poverty-concentrated ghetto cities, especially - were surviving and empowering themselves.\n\nJDH: Who's complaining about the chilling effect of the backlash against the Moynihan Report today?\n\nPNC: The occasion of my post was Nicholas Kristof's New York Times column . He rehashed history down to one sentence: \"The taboo on careful research on family structure and poverty was broken by William Julius Wilson, an eminent black sociologist,\" and said since then we've really learned the importance of family structure.\n\nThe myth-making aspect of that is that of course we have always known family structure was important and that single-parent families have fewer resources, and there are obvious challenges associated with that - but as an explanation for why people are poor or why the black population is poorer than the white population, it's just not a good explanation.\n\nJDH: You say the idea that some faction of the political left is silencing debate through \"political correctness\" has been revived, for example, by Jonathan Chait , who recently wrote \" How the language police are perverting liberalism \" for New York magazine. Do you see similar themes here as in the discussion around the Moynihan report?\n\nPNC: \"Political correctness\" is an idea that what happens, especially on campuses and really anywhere college-educated people congregate, is that the rules for what people can discuss are sort of dominated by liberals and progressives, and people shut people down, use toxic accusations like \"sexist\" or \"racist,\" and don't permit unorthodox attitudes. This has always been overblown, but the connection between Chait and those reviving the 1965 Moynihan Report is that in both cases [the complaints about political correctness are coming from] a conservative position that would like to describe itself as centrist and resents being pushed to the right.\n\nJDH: What's the predominant view among social scientists now when it comes to how black communities are doing?\n\nPNC: The predominant view now is that there is a specific condition of inner-city concentrated poverty especially in black communities, because of racial segregation and racism, and the structural conditions are very damaging to family life, family relationships. People lose jobs and housing because of incarceration, job discrimination, etc., which create real obstacles to family stability, which in turn is a challenging condition for children's development.\n\nWe have a pretty good consensus that family instability is a hurdle for children's development, but there is not a consensus that this stems from the bad decisions of people not to get married.\n\nJDH: What are some of the best post-Moynihan studies that reflect this thinking?\n\nPNC: These are some favorite studies, aiming for a variety of research styles and perspectives:\n\nYo' Mama's Disfunktional! Fighting the Culture Wars in Urban America , by Robin D.G. Kelley (1998)\n\nDoing the Best I Can: Fatherhood in the Inner City , by Kathryn Edin and Timothy J.

There are no signs of the excitement abating, either, as the conversation about the film has evolved from discussions about the importance of representation into something grander: a rather groundbreaking celebration of black culture.\n\nWith an all-star collection of majority black talent both in front of and behind the camera, Black Panther , under the direction of Ryan Coogler ( Fruitvale Station , Creed ), is about more than the latest superhero's journey; it's also about black culture's journey, and it points toward a future where it could be the culture. It acknowledges and celebrates everything from traditional African society to African-American political debates, from the power and beauty of black women to the preservation of identity, all within the lush confines of the fictional African nation of Wakanda.\n\nAll told, Black Panther 's greatest legacy may not be what it's done for Marvel, Hollywood, or box office records, but what it's done for the culture. In Wakanda, which offers much to marvel at for audiences of all backgrounds, black viewers in particular have found a cultural oasis that feels like nothing we've seen before.\n\nBlack Panther is in many ways a love letter to black culture. Africa has traditionally been an unsophisticated bit player in American media, often portrayed as backward, savage, and chaotic in everything from news coverage to films. It's a portrayal that has left little room for other interpretations, which is why Black Panther's vision of Wakanda as a bustling metropolis of vibranium-powered futuristic skyscrapers, racing trains, and soaring spaceships feels so refreshing.\n\nMarvel movies often take place in grand, imaginative locales, like Thor's Asgard or Guardians of the Galaxy' s far-flung planets. But nothing has been quite as audacious and poignant as Wakanda, a vision of Africa that feels indebted to both Jack Kirby and Octavia Butler, home to a thriving black population that represents our collective ingenuity and beauty. As a testament to black empowerment, Black Panther is an important artifact, but it's also, quite simply, a big draw for black moviegoers starved for this sort of vision.\n\nIt's not just Wakanda's skyline that makes an impact, though; the film drew on a team of designers and stylists to showcase a very specific, beautiful black aesthetic. In an interview with the New York Times, Camille Friend, who oversaw the various hair designs of what she calls \"a totally Afrocentric, natural hair movie,\" said the entire production was considered against a backdrop of a bigger black cultural moment: \"We're in a moment when people are feeling empowered about being black,\" she says. \"The hair helps communicate that.\"\n\nLike the film's hair, Black Panther 's costuming was an opportunity to infuse meaning and pride into the movie. As the film's head costume designer, Ruth Carter, shared with NPR , the costumes, like Wakanda itself, needed to evoke a place and people that had \"never been colonized, one that looked toward the future but was based on a real past.\"\n\nCarter and her team drew on Kenyan, Namibian, and South African reference points to complete the film's array of looks, reflecting not only the tribal diversity that exists within Wakanda but the diversity of black culture and identity as well. The film is a crucial stamp of validation for black people hungry for the opportunity to celebrate everything from Afrofuturism to the natural hair movement that's often been derided in mainstream spaces.\n\nThe care and intricacy of the film's styling carried a heavy price tag, with Marvel committing more money to Black Panther than its previous few films in order to achieve a visual splendor that's as exciting to the culture as it is to the eye. The result is the sort of spectacle black moviegoers rarely get to see in popular mainstream culture. That isn't lost on Marvel's Kevin Feige, who explained his reasoning behind the film's budget to Vulture : \"It's a big story that deserves to be told in a big way, for all of the cultural and political reasons that people talk about.\"\n\nThese vague \"cultural and political reasons\" are at the heart of a movie phenomenon that's inspired everything from Black Panther -themed watch parties to a voter registration initiative to a curriculum that encourages educators to leverage the film to teach deeper histories about African culture, politics, and history. It's also opened up dialogues and personal reflections about black identity in America and abroad via #WhatBlackPantherMeansToMe , a powerful cross section of editorial and real-time reflections on the film's resonance with black moviegoers.\n\nThe film has also jumped into the current of black political thought and action, prompting challenging think pieces about how T'Challa and Killmonger's rift is representative of familiar ideological debates in the black community, and what the film's politics represent about the state of black America . In addition to escapism and inspiration, Black Panther offers African Americans the opportunity to reexamine and reimagine their place in the world, both literally and figuratively. Wakanda has emerged as a vision of what's possible, representing what true liberation could look like, but the power of that fantasy is directly linked to the harsh realities of Erik Killmonger's experience growing up in Oakland, California, far away from that utopic vision.\n\nThe excitement around Black Panther doesn't exist in a vacuum; the film is the latest in a string of high-water-mark moments for a black pop culture landscape that's experiencing a renaissance. Recent years have seen a new level of black art that's intertwined sociopolitical commentary with high-caliber artistry: from Beyoncé's Lemonade and Kendrick Lamar's DAMN to Atlanta and Queen Sugar, there's been a renewed focus on telling stories that broaden and sharpen the range of black narratives.\n\nThis expansion is significant given black audiences' complex relationship with Hollywood, which has typically presented a narrow slice of the African-American narrative. It's an industry that has often seemed invested in black Americans primarily as slaves ( 12 Years a Slave ), victims of inner-city strife ( Detroit ), or symbols of comfort ( The Help ) and is fixated on stories about the post-Reconstruction and civil rights eras and biopics of famous black people that only glimpse at race .\n\nFor a long time, it's felt like the only stories about the African-American experience Hollywood was interested in telling were stories that were intertwined in some way with the white experience, making this shift toward stories that center black narratives as black narratives feel both welcome and long overdue.\n\nA similar shift has been afoot in Hollywood offscreen in recent years. As #OscarsSoWhite launched a debate about the industry's fidelity to representation and valuing nonwhite contributions, filmmakers like Moonlight 's Barry Jenkins, A Wrinkle in Time 's Ava DuVernay, and Get Out 's Jordan Peele have taken crucial pole positions as visionaries who are pushing the boundaries of black representation on film. Coogler's Black Panther joins these projects as a missing piece: a popcorn movie that uses the most mainstream of film genres - the superhero movie - to project the complexity of black identity, politics, and creativity.\n\nThe renewed conversation around race that Black Panther enters into extends beyond the entertainment industry. As the first black superhero film in a cinematic universe that's spent the past decade focused primarily on white superheroes, it underlines the chasm that exists between society's treatment of black Americans and white Americans.\n\nIn many ways, black bodies have experienced a renewed series of attacks in recent years. Black NFL players can't kneel in protest without recrimination from the president, team owners, or a conservative-leaning fan base. Everyday black citizens have been increasingly displaced in gentrifying cities, locked up in prisons at alarming rates, and shot and beaten by law enforcement at equally high ones.\n\nThis makes Black Panther a palate cleanser of sorts, a healthy injection of powerful, beautiful images of the black body. It's what's behind the lure of Wakanda, a land of black vibrancy, freedom, diversity, and discourse not blighted by outside forces or forced to negotiate with anyone but themselves. It's why the Killmonger/T'Challa chasm rings so true, as they both offer their own type of wish fulfillment for black viewers: Wouldn't it be nice to have a world where we aren't encumbered by systemic racism and oppression and are masters of our own destiny? And yet wouldn't it also be nice to galvanize a community with resources and political might to address and maybe even reverse the effects of that systemic oppression?\n\nTold from a posture of power and pride, Black Panther is in many ways a most necessary antidote for the black American experience in 2018, an elixir that provides escape into a world where black Americans can imagine these conversations outside of the white gaze. As black America feels under assault everywhere from Charlottesville to the White House, it's invaluable to be reminded that we still have the ability to soar and take action like T'Challa or Nakia or Okoye, to be strong black bodies of justice. The value of that reminder is not just timely - it's timeless.\n\nFor more on Black Panther, listen to our episode of Today Explained featuring Rise of the Black Panther author Evan Narcisse.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nHow Kristi Noem and Karoline Leavitt offer two visions of conservative femininity.\n\nDJs, club owners, and patrons alike say there's way too much standing around.\n\nAstrology's enormous appeal, explained for believers and skeptics.\n\nThe surprising truth about milk is hiding in plain sight.\n\n﻿From Dunkin' deodorant to Sabrina Carpenter perfume, smelling good isn't enough - it's all about smelling edible.\n\nA star-studded film explains the hope and hype behind regenerative agriculture.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nConservatives are embracing a new book by a veteran criminologist that tries to blame \"black culture\" for violent crime. But there are big holes in the idea.\n\nby German Lopez\n\nWalking through a major US city without serious fear of harm is one of those simple acts that many Americans now take for granted. On a Saturday night in Washington, DC, I can walk a few blocks from my old Columbia Heights apartment to an active shopping center filled with restaurants, pet stores, a Target, and more - with people drinking outside, others eating food from countries all across the world, and kids running around and playing in the plaza. I have done this walk multiple times, not once thinking about whether I would get shot or robbed.\n\nJust a few decades ago, this would have been an unimaginable sight in this exact neighborhood. The area would have been largely abandoned. Many of the people going through the streets would have been darting through as quickly as possible. As was true in many US cities at the time, it was more likely - doubly so nationwide, based on violent crime figures - that around the corner could be a total stranger ready to take your watch, your wallet, and even your life.\n\nOne federal study put this in stark context, suggesting that if crime rates kept at the levels of the late 1970s and early '80s, more than 80 percent of Americans aged 12 at the time would be victimized by a violent crime in their lifetime - rates impossible to fathom today.\n\nThe Rise and Fall of Violent Crime in America , a new book by Barry Latzer, a criminologist at John Jay College, tells the story of how America went from the peaceful era of the immediate post-World War II period to the massive, decades-long crime waves of the 1960s through 1990s, and, finally, the relatively peaceful period we're in today.\n\nLatzer also offers an explanation for why crime was so high in previous decades and is now so low. His thesis is controversial: He says cultural factors may have more influence than anything else on violence levels.\n\nMost controversially, he says a \"black culture of violence\" explains much of the crime rise: \"[T]he black migration to cities, especially the big cities of the North, brought a culture of violence to the urban landscape. The effects of migration by a group with historically high levels of violence were compounded by the increase in young males within the African American population.\"\n\nThe thesis isn't totally new. Conservatives, in particular, have long argued that culture contributes to the massive crime and violence problem seen in inner-city black communities. But Latzer offers a fairly prominent, scholarly example of this argument.\n\nThe book has not received much attention, but it has garnered praise from a certain segment of conservatives - leading to articles from David Frum at the Atlantic , the Federalist , and Breitbart about Latzer's work.\n\nThe rest of America hasn't paid much attention to the book. As Alfred Regnery wrote at Breitbart, \"You would think that such a study would be warmly welcomed, written about and reviewed widely. But you would be wrong. Professor Latzer's book has all but been ignored.\"\n\nPerhaps some of that neglect is because, at face value, the book may seem like it's just rehashing the same old issues. Ta-Nehisi Coates, a prominent writer at the Atlantic, has written on the subject of \"black culture\" and crime time and time and time again. For journalists and scholars, having this debate so many times can get tiring.\n\nStill, Latzer's is a credible scholarly work that's being taken very seriously by a significant faction of the American political spectrum. Just for that, it's worth looking at what we can learn from the book and what it tells us about these ongoing debates, particularly as Black Lives Matter and other racial justice movements continue across the US.\n\nLatzer's book is at its best - and most revealing - when it's focused simply on the history of crime in America and, particularly, how it rose and fell through the latter half of the 20th century. But the book struggles to provide much insight when it focuses on \"black culture.\" The term \"black culture\" is so vague to be at once unnecessary and useless at explaining exactly what's going on in black communities. It's also offensive - a broad, biased characterization of 13 percent of Americans.\n\nBefore diving into Latzer's theory about \"black culture,\" let's look at what makes his book undeniably important: Latzer is trying to address a major gap in the study of crime.\n\nThere's one big problem in just about any conversation about crime in America: We may know some causes of crime, but we don't know all the causes.\n\nThis remains true even with the huge crime drop America has seen: Although many Americans lived through this big decline, we have no single concrete explanation for why, for example, murder rates plummeted from a high of 10.2 per 100,000 people in 1980 to 4.5 in 2014, the year with the most recent data.\n\nIt's not that criminologists lack ideas to explain the crime drop of the past couple of decades. They've put forward all sorts of theories : mass incarceration, more aggressive policing, changes in the economy, the legalization of abortion, the drop in exposure to lead, and much more. All of these have research and experts lined up behind them and against them.\n\nBut you need to talk to only a handful of experts in the field to realize that virtually no one agrees on what were the biggest contributors to the rise and fall of crime. As criminal justice expert John Roman of the Urban Institute often tells me, he alone can think up at least 20 explanations - and they might not all match with all the ideas other experts are considering.\n\nPart of the problem here, as criminologist Richard Rosenfeld has told me , is that there is no good source of data for violent crime in America. The best data collector in the field is the FBI , but that data comes out with a nearly one-year lag, and everyone agrees it's likely underreporting crime. If researchers have a hard time collecting the basic raw crime statistics, how can they provide definitive answers for the reasons and trends behind those statistics?\n\nThis is where Latzer comes in. Latzer acknowledges that there's a dearth of good data on all of these issues, but his book pulls together the scholarly work done despite the inadequate data to give a more systematic review of the research and fill in what we can learn and don't yet know about fighting and preventing massive crime waves.\n\nLatzer suggests that America's recent crime drop was partly a result of a few significant changes: baby boomers aging out of their peak crime ages (teens, 20s, and 30s), and the escalation of the criminal justice system. Latzer writes that the boomers growing up \"was the main reason for the end of the post-1960s crime tsunami.\"\n\nWhen the boomers' children came of age, there was, in Latzer's words, \"a shortterm crime wave.\" But this time, the criminal justice system kicked into high gear: \"The pressures of police harassment, arrests, and high rates of imprisonment, combined with the consequences of the whole grim cocaine lifestyle, set off an anticrack craze - a positive contagion - and by the mid-1990s, the short-term spike was over. The great crime tidal wave was finally receding.\"\n\nLatzer argues that the criminal justice system, rather than socioeconomic policies that tend to focus on solving poverty or improving education, keeps us safe from crime.\n\nHe also suggests that our current peaceful era won't last forever. He quotes crime historian Eric Monkkonen : \"When the murder rate ebbs, control efforts get relaxed, thus creating the multiple conditions causing the next upswing.\"\n\nThese are the beliefs that guide Latzer's work throughout his book, as he explains the theories that he sees as most credible for why violent crime rose and fell in the post-World War II era. What Latzer says makes sense, although other criminologists will very likely poke holes in his review of the research and contest, in particular, claims that mass incarceration was a huge contributor to the crime drop. After all, the huge crime drop came decades after incarceration began to steeply rise, as criminal justice scholar William Stuntz argues in The Collapse of American Criminal Justice .\n\nBut the most troubling aspect of Latzer's book isn't about these common debates over the rise and fall of violent crime. Rather, Latzer's most concerning assertion is that \"black culture\" and its spread to big cities is a big reason that crime exploded in the 1960s and forward.\n\nThe book acknowledges that people who study crime tend to fall into two categories: those who believe crime is the result of systemic social problems such as economic inequality and racism, and those who blame crime on the pathologies and cultural problems inherent to certain groups of people - in Latzer's words, who link \"the beliefs and values of social groups to their crime rates.\"\n\nLatzer seems to fall in between: He argues that \"black culture\" is more violent as a result of systemic racism.\n\nHe says that black Americans inherited a violent culture from white Southerners, the same people who enslaved and oppressed black people in the days of slavery and Jim Crow. (This provocative theory was also championed by Thomas Sowell , who wrote, controversially, about the historical development of what he described as self-destructive \"black culture.\")\n\nLatzer supports this argument by pointing out that historically, crime rates among white Southerners have been higher than among white people in other parts of the country. To explain why, Latzer quotes the work of psychologists Richard Nisbett and Dov Cohen :\n\nUnlike the North, which was settled by farmers from England, Holland, and Germany, the South was settled by herdsmen from the fringes of Britain. Herdsmen the world over tend to be capable of great aggressiveness and violence because of their vulnerability to losing their primary resources, their animals. Also, unlike the North, where population densities have been in general relatively high, the South was a low-population frontier region until well into the nineteenth century. In such regions the state often has little power to command compliance with the law, and citizens have to create their own system of order. The means for doing this is the rule of retaliation: If you cross me, I will punish you.\n\nLatzer argues that this, along with systemic oppression that black Americans have faced for generations, is the root of a violent \"black culture.\"\n\nFrom there, he walks through the rise in crime in big cities following the Great Migration's end in the 1960s. Near the peak in 1990, the violent crime rate in New York City was close to 2,400 per 100,000 people.\n\nThe book claims that the essential change of the post-Great Migration era is that cities became predominantly black. \"Insofar as crime is concerned,\" Latzer wrote, \"the effect was to transport high levels of black violent crime to the big cities of the United States, with profound consequences for urban black communities and, ultimately, for the entire nation.\"\n\nBut Latzer doesn't quite say how his \"black culture\" argument fits into the recent crime drop. Crime has fallen quickly in big cities in recent decades as their black populations barely changed or actually grew.\n\nFor example, Philadelphia's murder rate fell from 31.7 per 100,000 people in 1990 to 20.1 per 100,000 in 2010 as the percent of its population that's black grew from 39.9 percent to 43.4 percent. New York City's murder rate, meanwhile, plummeted from 30.7 to 6.6 as its black population dropped slightly from 28.7 percent to 25.5 percent.\n\nAnd this isn't the only problem with the \"black culture\" argument.\n\nWhere Latzer gets into trouble is that he's broadly calling something \"culture\" that really may be thousands of causes of crime, some of which we may not know about or can't measure in hard numbers.\n\nConsider one of these possible factors: Black communities may be more violent and crime-ridden in response to a criminal justice system that has both under- and overpoliced them. In the fantastic Ghettoside , journalist Jill Leovy draws on the stories of police officers and black residents in violence-torn parts of Los Angeles to weave a nuanced story of how the justice system deals with crime depending on the community involved.\n\nLeovy writes that police often harass black people for petty crimes - such as drugs, jaywalking, traffic rules, and loitering. But when black people most need police to prevent and solve violent crimes, they are not present. Investigations have found, for instance, that homicides involving black victims are much less likely to be solved than those with white victims. It's a two-sided coin of systemic racism.\n\n\"Like the schoolyard bully, our criminal justice system harasses people on small pretexts but is exposed as a coward before murder,\" Leovy writes. \"It hauls masses of black men through its machinery but fails to protect them from bodily injury and death. It is at once oppressive and inadequate.\"\n\nThe result: Only 30 percent of black people reported \"a great deal\" or \"quite a lot\" of confidence in the police during a 2014-'15 period, versus 57 percent of white people, according to Gallup .\n\nThe criminal justice system has abandoned the most significant needs of black people, while fostering resentment and distrust with excessive policing of small crimes . In the face of this, black communities have turned to their own means - including violence - to solve conflicts that would normally be solved in courts.\n\n(As Latzer notes, \"Murder and its junior partner, assault, are in the main precipitated by anger, sexual jealousy, perceived insults and threats, long-standing personal quarrels, and similar issues, frequently facilitated by alcohol or some other disinhibiting substance.\")\n\nAfter all, preventing interpersonal conflicts is the main reason for the criminal justice system's existence. Leovy writes:\n\nIn the dim early stirring of civilization, many scholars believe, law itself was developed as a response to legal \"self-help\": people's desire to settle their own scores. Rough justice slowly gave way to organized state monopolies on violence. The low homicide rate of some modern democracies are, perhaps, an aberration in human history.\n\nIndeed, Latzer acknowledges this. In The Code of the Streets , Elijah Anderson analyzed the reality that many black people in violent neighborhoods live under and the grim rules (\"the code\") they've adopted that essentially allow violence to solve disputes the law can't be trusted to take care of. Citing Anderson's work, Latzer writes:\n\nThe code also was a product of the perception that law enforcement can't or won't control violent crime. \"Feeling they cannot depend on the police and other civil authorities to protect them from danger,\" residents adhere to \"a set of informal rules governing interpersonal public behavior, particularly violence. The rules prescribe both proper comportment and the proper way to respond if challenged.\"\n\nBut how do you prove anything like this empirically? How do you measure the actual, full impact of systemic racism or distrust in law enforcement? Mathematical models are very advanced nowadays, but they can't explain everything. We still don't even fully know why crime rose and fell during the period Latzer looks at - something Latzer acknowledges. So how can we be expected to measure something as abstract as the effects of distrust or a systemic force that has existed since America was founded?\n\nAnd there are many more factors to crime in black communities: disproportionate rates of poverty , racial segregation that leads to concentrations of poverty in their neighborhoods, horrible social mobility , job discrimination , and so on.\n\nWith all these complicated issues that can be hard to untangle, a term like \"culture\" seems to provide an easy answer. It helps put a concept, however abstract, to the hard-to-explain. But the vagueness of the term presents a serious problem - suggesting that Latzer is putting a diverse group of people into a monolithic culture.\n\nAll of this can sound pedantic, but it's important. In studying this history and getting it right, we can learn from what worked and what didn't. So in looking at the unfortunate reality of high crime in black communities, getting into the nitty-gritty of what's going on - instead of just broadly applying a vague label like \"culture\" - is crucial to learning how to fix all of this.\n\nFor example, if the problem is really a mix of under- and overpolicing, there are policy reforms the country can take on to address this. We know how to make police officers more effective - by working with the community to focus resources on very specific troubled areas and individuals. And we know there are policy changes that could help build trust between the police and black neighborhoods - such as cops working more closely with the people who live there, and police taking their communities' criticisms more seriously. These ideas can work together to reduce crime and improve trust.\n\nBut if the issue is \"culture,\" as Latzer argues, that's a much more abstract problem that can't be definitively addressed with policy solutions - and in fact might dissuade reform. As Latzer writes, \"Cultures of violence may persist for decades, even centuries, and travel with their bearers.\"\n\nIn light of this, the continued punitiveness of the criminal justice system may seem like the right answer - and that's exactly what many conservatives would like. After all, in the face of an inherently violent culture that could last centuries, why should a system meant to protect us all relax in any way? Mass incarceration and aggressive policing are needed, from this view, to put away people fundamentally corrupted by their culture.\n\n(It's not just conservatives, either; this is the kind of logic that led Hillary Clinton to speak out against violent teenage \"superpredators\" in the 1990s, when her husband, as president, enacted \"tough-on-crime\" laws .)\n\nApplying a broad label also seems far more counterproductive, misleading, and even insulting than it is useful.\n\nFor one, the term \"black culture\" suggests it's inherent among all black people. That's just not true, considering a majority of violent crime is committed by a small fraction of the population . If this is something that was pushed on a small minority of black Americans by white people's prejudice, can it really be described as \"black culture\"?\n\nIn fact, there's no reason to think the violent cultural traits that Latzer describes are even \"black,\" as the term \"black culture\" suggests. As Leovy wrote in Ghettoside : \"Take a bunch of teenage boys from the whitest, safest suburb in America and plunk them down in a place where their friends are murdered and they are constantly attacked and threatened. Signal that no one cares, and fail to solve murders. Limit their options for escape. Then see what happens.\"\n\nYet many people do use this term to bash black Americans. Blaming \"black culture\" is a common form of coded language that politicians and pundits use to get away with explicitly racist messages - from crime to immigration and terrorism.\n\nIan Haney López, author of Dog Whistle Politics , explained : \"Current racial code operates by appealing to deep-seated stereotypes of groups that are perceived as threatening. But they differ from naked racial terms in that they don't emphasize biology - so it's not references to brown skin or black skin.\" He added, \"It allows people to say, 'Hey, I'm just criticizing the behavior, not criticizing a racially defined group.'\"\n\nThe \"culture\" label also doesn't give any information to fully understand these issues. This is a problem in Latzer's book more broadly - what he means by \"culture\" remains very vague, and he never provides any clear solutions to these supposed cultural problems.\n\nDespite the troubling discussion of \"black culture,\" Latzer's history is valuable in detailing why policymakers in the 1960s through 1990s reacted harshly to crime with policy prescriptions such as mass incarceration, which are now under a lot of scrutiny today. Latzer makes it clear the punitive measures were, despite the racially disparate effects, a reaction to a genuine fear of crime.\n\nLatzer cites a notable set of statistics to demonstrate this point:\n\nThe federal Bureau of Justice Statistics once calculated, based on crime victimization rates from 1975 to 1984, the lifetime chances of being raped, robbed, or assaulted. The numbers were astounding. If crime rates remained the same (which, of course, they didn't), 83 percent of all Americans aged 12 at the time would, in their actuarial lifetimes, be victimized by an attempted or completed violent crime, and 40 percent would be injured as a result of a robbery or assault.\n\nThese are the kind of numbers that the public, media, and lawmakers worried about in the '60s through '90s. Rates of violent crime and drug use, particularly during the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s, really were unusually high, as federal statistics show. And the public knew it: Gallup's polling shows Americans in the 1960s, '70s, '80s, and especially the early '90s were much more likely to say that crime was \"the most important problem\" facing the US.\n\nBut in their fears of these statistics, policymakers embraced a tremendous escalation of the criminal justice system. This escalation had dire effects: The US now incarcerates more people than any other country in the world, including authoritarian regimes like China and Russia. Black people are nearly six times as likely to be locked up as their white peers, with only about 61 to 80 percent of that overrepresentation explained by higher crime rates in black communities.\n\nThe racial disparity is one of the major explanations for black Americans' distrust of the criminal justice system. It is, in other words, one reason that people in these communities may feel the need to take the law into their own hands - sometimes leading to more violent crime.\n\nBut were the racially disparate results that have led to this distrust deliberate - the \"new Jim Crow,\" to use a term popularized by Michelle Alexander's book of the same name ? Latzer's history suggests they weren't, since policymakers - including black leaders - were reacting to a real crime wave. This is an important point of clarification for political discourse, demonstrating just how vast a well-meaning policy's unintended consequences can be.\n\nThe history suggests that the next time someone develops a policy that leads to big racial disparities, the perpetrator won't necessarily be an outright racist villain that Americans can readily see through. Instead, it will likely be someone who really has good intentions and is genuinely trying to solve the problems of the day - but is not thinking enough about the downsides and possible unintended consequences.\n\nSo to avoid more policies as disastrous as mass incarceration, Americans need to be well aware of that possibility of bad consequences despite good intentions. Otherwise, a new round of criminal justice policies, like the old, could cause the exact problems in black communities and high levels of crime that The Rise and Fall of Violent Crime worries so much about.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

If you want to predict a trend years in advance, go where lipgloss application techniques are perfected before they hit TikTok and the next big female rap artist is selected way before you stumble upon whoever is trending. Ice Spice ? Black teenage girls listened to her while you were still figuring out who Glorilla is. The makeup hack you'll be swearing by six months in the future ( slugging ? Black girls have been dousing themselves in Vaseline for decades) was inspired by a Black girl's beauty supply run before a blogger makes it go viral.\n\nBlack teenage girls are the invisible tastemakers creating and popularizing some of the biggest trends simply by being their authentic selves. It's the everyday Black girl, without a platform or the machine of capitalism behind her, who exudes cool without having to try. A tongue-in-cheek line from \"Best I Ever Had,\" the song that catapulted Drake to the mainstream, is \"When my album drop, bitches'll buy it for the picture, and ni**as'll buy it too and claim they got it for they sister.\" This line encapsulates a pattern in American culture that eventually defines the zeitgeist but is rarely correctly credited.\n\nThe effect Black teenagers have on popular culture has only increased as technology makes the world - and trends - less regional and more universal. In 2018, Nielsen reported that Black consumers are in a \"remarkable period of influence,\" with the \"highest smartphone ownership and usage of any demographic group and an unyielding desire for self-expression and image control.\" TikTok itself is a shining example of how Black teenagers, especially girls, are at the center of pop culture. Black teen girls like Jalaiah Harmon and Keara Wilson famously created the viral dances that helped turn TikTok into what it is today. This means that Black teenagers are now on a virtual stage for the whole world to study - and why you see influencers from Sweden or nepo babies from Calabasas cosplaying as Black girls.\n\nIn addition to Nielsen's findings that prove Black consumers are highly influential, the media research company reported that the preferences of Black women in particular are a main driving force. And these young women, particularly Gen Z, are demanding to be seen on their own terms - even if that means creating their own content. Creating niche communities on platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok makes it easier now for Black girls to find spaces where they can be unapologetically themselves, without fear of being told they're \"doing too much.\"\n\nThese communities, which often start in the bedrooms of fly and ambitious Black girls, garner attention from big brands and marketers creating influencers almost overnight. Black girls who are into natural hair , alt aesthetics , or anything else under the sun easily find community online. Kendra Bracken-Ferguson, founder of the social media and brand representation agency BrainTrust, noted that \"the notion of being black and a woman is having a key moment in society, between black girl magic and black lives matter. Investments are being made to support and shape black consumerism, which is largely driven by the idea that black women influence the shopping habits and purchases of their peers.\" Ferguson's agency did a case study with the popular beauty supply store Sally's. They found that when they leaned into these niche communities of influencers, they engaged with their followers \"at a rate of 261% more than their general market peers.\"\n\nSince the invention of the teenager as the demographic that we know today, the desires and preferences of adolescents have been a driving force for popular culture. The phrase \"teenager\" was introduced into the American vernacular by advertisers in the 1940s, emerging as a result of postwar developments in the economy, education, and technology. The end of widespread child labor (although there are still unsettling cases within the US) combined with widespread compulsory education meant society was no longer made up of simply adults and children, but also an emerging group of young adults who had their own society outside of the home and were able to gain even more independence as automobiles rose in popularity.\n\nIn 1958, the New Yorker ran an article about young people who were too young to work but too old to be infantilized. The publication noted that the \"teenage market - and, in fact, the very notion of the teenager - has been created by the businessmen who exploit it,\" arguing that advertisers hopped on the opportunity to directly target this growing demographic. This rings true today: Experts estimate that Gen Z's overwhelming buying power exceeds $150 billion.\n\nAs journalist Derek Thompson wrote , \"modern culture is fully teenocratic, governed by the tastes of young people, with old fogies forever playing catch-up.\" From the moment the concept of being a teenager entered the collective consciousness, their gravitational pull toward coolness began to emanate outward to the rest of society. But what even is \"cool\"? Thompson defines it as a positive rebellion, \"breaking away from an illegitimate mainstream in a legitimate way.\" America, a country built on rebellion, is constantly looking for ways to be different and revolutionary. And, historically, Black people are the go-to resource for new culture: As the prolific writer bell hooks once said , \"I believe that American culture is obsessed with transgression. And to the degree that Blackness remains a primary sign of transgression, one could talk about American culture and mainstream culture as being obsessed with Blackness.\"\n\nBlack culture, in a sense, is a rejection of whiteness, showing up in all the ways attempted cultural genocide couldn't suppress our Africanness. It's seen in our clothing, our music, our speech, and the way we carry ourselves. It also makes sense why teenagers of all races could inherently feel and relate to the rebellion in the sounds Black people created out of resistance. We see this in the counterculture of each generation embracing the newest Black music, whether that's jazz, rock-'n'-roll, R&B, disco, funk, or hip-hop.\n\nAs Vox's Constance Grady wrote , \"Teenage girls anointed the Beatles. But you already knew that. ... To be a teenage girl is to simultaneously be pop culture's ultimate punching bag, cash cow, and gatekeeper.\" Who anointed the artists that the Beatles appropriated? Black girls. They're the ones who swooned and screamed in the presence of Chuck Berry and other Black heartthrobs of the time, the people from whom the Beatles openly took large inspiration . They were the ones hanging at the roller rinks in the '70s being used as a test audience by DJs to gauge popularity. Lolita Shanté Gooden, a 14-year-old Black girl, wrote the first rap diss track in the '80s, \" Roxanne's Revenge ,\" beginning a long tradition in hip-hop. Who other than a Black teen girl could think of turning a scathing read into a rap song? Boyz II Men, a group adored by young Black girls, began the boy band craze in the '90s, paving the way for the Backstreet Boys and NSYNC.\n\nToday, they're changing the hip-hop landscape as we know it, ditching the blatant misogyny of male rappers in favor of women like Ice Spice, who embodies the aesthetic of a 2000s teenager in her velour sweatsuits and shoulder bags. In 2020, for the first time ever, there were two weeks when three female rap artists occupied the top two Billboard spots: Doja Cat and Nicki Minaj with the \"Say So\" remix and Megan Thee Stallion's \"Savage\" remix featuring Beyoncé, both songs that spread like wildfire. Because rap is the popular music genre with one of the youngest fan bases (48 percent of 16- to 19-year-olds claim it as their favorite), it's inevitable that the preferences of Black teenage girls move the needle in what's considered popular.\n\nThe same goes for fashion: Many argue that Black people's association with style traces back to West Africa, where it's been a long tradition to adorn oneself and reflect the beauty of the continent's abundant resources through jewels, gold, and vibrant colors. A group of Black girls from the projects in Detroit would form the Supremes and heavily impact the style of the '60s. The everyday young girls of the '70s, with their Afro puffs and bell bottoms, have looks that stood the test of time. Aaliyah's teenage fashion , as well as the looks of girl groups like Destiny's Child and TLC, remains a prevailing symbol of the style of the '90s. Before Carrie had her infamous nameplate necklace on Sex and the City , Black teenage girls wore them as part of a long tradition in their neighborhoods. (Patricia Fields, the legendary costume designer of the HBO series, admitted that she incorporated the nameplate after seeing a lot of kids in New York City wearing them. Statistically, it would be a surprise if most of those kids weren't Black girls.)\n\nIn the digital age, accounts like @aliyahsinterlude on TikTok showcase how an everyday young Black girl can be at the pinnacle of style. Women like Aleali May and Teyana Taylor got their start as stylish teens who were noticed by major players in the fashion industry.\n\nBeyond their outward style, the vernacular of these young girls has spread like wildfire. Non-Black people from all walks of life have made a habit of turning on a blaccent like it's a filter to use when they want to be seen as sassy or cool, ready to be disposed of when it's time to be taken seriously. Some don't even realize they're doing it - there's been discourse surrounding people conflating AAVE with \"internet language,\" which is yet another instance that proves Black girls have a massive, and unappreciated, impact on culture. These words that are being appropriated weren't all created in the mouths of middle-aged Black people but rather through the banter of mostly Black girls (not to mention queer youth, who deserve an essay of their own about their enormous contributions).\n\nThe influence of Black girls does not take away from the repercussions of white supremacy and global anti-Blackness. Living at the intersection of youth, Blackness, and womanhood, Black teen girls are one of the most vulnerable communities. Children are arguably a section of our population that receive the least amount of autonomy and respect with little real protection, too often treated like property or only an extension of their parents. Teenage girls of all races are dealing with a mental health crisis. The Washington Post reported that nearly 1 in 3 high school-age girls said they had considered suicide, and almost 15 percent said they had been forced to have sex. On top of that, Black girls are disproportionately sexualized and seen as more mature than they really are. And Black women and girls experience sexism from within their own communities, contributing to the erasure of Black women's impact on American history.\n\nWhile brands and investors have clearly noticed the lucrative cultural capital of Black girls, there is still a lack of respect and political support for them. This creates an oxymoronic landscape where Black teenage girls are overlooked while simultaneously being the leading curators of popular culture, with their impact (if it's even recognized in the first place) ultimately attributed to Black culture as a whole. Despite deserving way more credit than they've ever received, young Black girls will remain trendsetters because, as playwright Lorraine Hansberry once said, \"Though it be a thrilling and marvelous thing to be merely young and gifted in such times, it is doubly dynamic to be young, gifted and Black.\"\n\nIle-Ife Okantah is a cultural critic and media scholar with a master's degree in journalism.

In its more than 900 episodes, it launched musicians like Teena Marie , Curtis Mayfield , and the Jackson Five , and others like Vivica A. Fox , Jody Watley , and Rosie Perez , to new heights of fame. Now, 54 years after the groundbreaking show's premiere, its impact on culture and history hasn't diminished.\n\nSoul Train was an ensemble show, featuring musicians, dancers, comedians, and special guests who came together to put on a grand show. It was glittery and glamorous, but also intimate and personal, with celebrities like Patti LaBelle , Elton John , and Little Richard mingling with the dancers in the audience. Simply put, you couldn't miss it. Richard Gay, the producer of a soon-to-be-on- Broadway musical called Soul Train , tells Vox, \"The day Soul Train was supposed to come on, we all knew we needed to have our chores done and everything together so we could watch. ... Then you got older and started tuning in so you could use the dances at the parties that weekend.\"\n\nI was too young to really engage with Soul Train during my childhood (and wasn't even alive during its peak). Still, its legacy lives on for me. From reruns, I can recall with ease the intro, with the animated train, the screech of \"The Soullll Trainnn!,\" and a smooth voice calling it \"the hippest trip in America.\" I have vivid memories of Don Cornelius, Soul Train 's founder and legendary \"conductor\" or host. And the iconic Soul Train line, where people make a corridor and one person has the spotlight, dancing wildly and passionately down the line as everyone claps and cheers, which showed up at so many of my family functions and parties at my alma mater, the historically Black Howard University. It's undeniable that Soul Train has been a huge part of my life, and that of many others, even long after it stopped airing.\n\nBethonie Butler, author of Black TV: Five Decades of Groundbreaking Television from Soul Train to Black-ish and Beyond , writes that the variety music program started as a local show on Chicago's WCIU , a TV station that's now part of The CW, featuring local musicians like Jerry Butler, the Chi-Lites, and the Emotions. The small local show, often described as the Black version of American Bandstand , an ensemble show that was once only for whites, quickly took off due to the culture's hunger for the show and its host's hunger for success. (Don Cornelius's son said Cornelius wanted to be the \"next Black Dick Clark,\" the host of American Bandstand .)\n\n\"Once people start to hear about it, then the big acts wanted to be a part of it. I know for a fact his initial bookings of the show were not the biggest acts,\" Tony Cornelius, Don's son, told KCRW . \"But the biggest acts decided that they wanted to be a part of it and it became the place to be, because everyone started to hear about this phenomenon.\"\n\nIts tremendous popularity - it remains the longest first-run syndicated television series in broadcast history - and a key partnership with Johnson Products , the makers of the Afro-Sheen hair care brand, led to its status as a radical show for the times, slotted next to commercials that proudly showcased natural hairstyles like glistening Afros and fluffy tresses in spite of the pressure for Black hair to conform to European standards. Suddenly it wasn't just Black music or dance on the national stage, but our hair as well.\n\nBlack fashion was also a huge part of the show's success. When people came on Soul Train , they dressed their best. Rich and bright colors, textured fabrics of thick satin and corduroy, dashikis and sequined blazers with shoulder pads and gleaming gold buttons, sharp angles and soft leathers. The fashion was unique and bright, consisting of bell bottoms, exaggerated collars, and flowy blouses. It was a richness of style that felt like seeing the best of ourselves in a time when Black people on TV were often reduced to minstrels - characters that exaggerate negative stereotypes of Black people - or weren't included at all.\n\nIn his 20s, when he was still working for WCIU, Don Cornelius reported on social unrest and met figures like Rev. Jesse Jackson and Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Tony Cornelius told KCRW , \"My father initially just wanted to do a show that presented Blacks in a positive light, because there was nothing like that going on. I mean, the only thing that you saw about African Americans was on the news where they were being arrested or something.\"\n\nIt was glittery and glamorous, but also intimate and personal\n\nGay, who stood in the lobby after every performance of his musical in the Bay Area, was surprised when Fredrika Newton, the widow of Huey P. Newton, co-founder of the revolutionary Black Panther Party who was murdered in 1989, came up to him to thank him for the nod in the show to the civil rights movement, including the Black Panther Party. \"She was almost in tears and she was like, 'Me and Huey used to watch Soul Train every Saturday. It would bring us joy.'\"\n\nCassie Taylor, a musician whose upbringing was greatly influenced by Soul Train and her father, blues musician Otis Taylor, told me, \"Black culture was demonized by the majority of white media, and Soul Train was a place for people to safely express themselves. ... It retains its iconicism because the joy is contagious.\" Taylor, who has had a supplemental business from flipping vintage clothing in the past, said her childhood memories of Soul Train informed what she looked for in vintage and thrift shops for her customers.\n\nEntertainers like Bill Withers, Al Green, Bobby Womack, Little Richard, Stevie Wonder, and Marvin Gaye all furthered their careers by appearing on the show. From Soul Train dancer Jeffrey Daniel, Michael Jackson learned the robot and \"backslide,\" which was renamed the moonwalk, Jackson's trademark dance. Part of Aretha Franklin's great fame came from her appearance on the show. After Don Cornelius's death in 2008, Franklin told ABC that \"An appearance on ' Soul Train' meant, what it could mean, a person being virtually an unknown person to an American sensation overnight, very similar to 'American Idol.'\" She said, \"It was like if you had a record that sold maybe 10,000 copies, to be on ' Soul Train ' meant it might sell 100 to 200- to 300- or even 500,000 or more.\"\n\nDespite - or perhaps because of - its emphasis on joy and togetherness, Soul Train was a response to an incredibly bleak time for Black Americans . When it premiered in 1970 in Chicago , Black Americans like my grandparents were still fleeing racial terror and poverty in the South as part of the Great Migration. Segregation had ended legally, but its disastrous effects were still felt in Black communities everywhere.\n\nVeronica McComb, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Bryant University, told me in an interview that \"Black bodies were constantly in danger to a high degree. To be in a safe and protected space to express themselves physically in the form of dress and dance was just, as they say, it was everything.\"\n\nSoul Train premiered at a time when those who had already migrated were still trying to find community and navigate new racial discrimination in different contexts. \"If you're away from home, like many African Americans were as part of the Great Migration, Soul Train definitely gave you that stronger sense of home,\" McComb said. The act of watching became not only a space to gather but a conversation point the next morning at school or work, a way for Black people to find each other in all spaces.\n\nSegregation continued socially, with Black people being chased out of white neighborhoods and schools, while Black neighborhoods and schools remaining overpoliced and underfunded. Lynchings continued, and sundown towns didn't cease their violence toward Black people. Meanwhile, those who managed to integrate faced their own set of challenges - some of which were intensified. \"Integration wasn't necessarily the wonderful thing that it was intended to be in terms of creating better equity and equality for African Americans,\" McComb said. \"In some cases, it created a lot of inequity and even more discrimination. ... Soul Train having a space for African Americans was a form of resistance against the forces that would say, 'You are still not equal; you are still not valued.' It was a way to say, 'Yes, we are indeed.'\"\n\n\"There's an element of spontaneity to the show that just doesn't exist much anymore\"\n\nFor most of its airing, non-Black performers and guests on Soul Train were rare. \"It had to be a very particular type of entertainer that was valued by the Black community to be accepted onto Soul Train, because it was such a protected space for Black expression and Black entertainment,\" McComb said.\n\nGay's Soul Train musical delves into the entrepreneur and visionary Don Cornelius's biggest project. \"He was a kingmaker, right? At the show's height, you had people like Elton John going, 'I have this giant audience that knows 'Crocodile Rock' that doesn't look like me. How do I reach them? Well, Soul Train was the answer to that,\" said Gay.\n\nOn May 17, 1975, Elton John became the first white performer to appear on the show. After that, Soul Train became a sort of litmus test for all musicians but especially white ones. There was a difference between only making music for white people and making music that Black people could jive to as well, a sort of encapsulation of the radicalism of Soul Train. Here, in this integrated space, Black folks made the culture and determined who could cross over into our spaces, an act that truly could transform singers and widen their audience.\n\nIt was also a time when popular forms of Black creativity were more accessible. It didn't cost three months' rent to see our biggest stars in concert, and spending hundreds on an outfit was unheard of. Pictures of Soul Train from its height show the special environment it cultivated. One in particular shows Marvin Gaye in the crowd , at the audience's level, smiling and interacting as equals. The fashion was textured, layered, quality, and unique. It was a kind of fashion culture that would be hard to reproduce today because the way we make and consume clothes - in factories with labor exploitation, producing waste that is contributing mightily to the existential climate crisis , and simply making clothes less stylish - has changed radically, for the very worst.\n\nWe are in a similar state of despair as the one that Soul Train was born out of. Covid-19 isolated people for months and killed more than a million Americans. Economic instability and student loan debt are crushing people's hopes for the future. Police brutality is a constant worry for Black people and other marginalized groups. Our court system appears ever more imperiled . We are watching devastating violence take place overseas. This has all taken a tremendous toll on the collective psyche. In the face of such despair, it's natural that people express a rising dissent against the disappointments of this world, and are actively looking for artistic spaces to express that dissent. \"We are in a post-pandemic world and we need a reboot of Soul Train ,\" Taylor says, adding that the horrors of late-stage capitalism make this more urgent.\n\nSoul Train was revolutionary, but Cornelius was a skilled businessman who went after numbers. Yet Soul Train feels anti-capitalist in some ways in retrospect, not because it was created that way, but because we live in a more flagrantly exploitative and consumerist society than ever before. The show was still revolutionary because of its assertion of Black people's right to joy and unbridled expression in the face of forces meant to destroy our bodies and souls.\n\nMuch of why people loved Soul Train was the intimacy and spontaneity. We live in a time when much of our culture is intensely curated by algorithms and trends, where fast fashion and cosmetic surgeries have produced an eerie sense of sameness, and when public images are more carefully managed than ever before, making it difficult to assess who artists truly are. \" Soul Train wasn't very structured,\" said McComb. \"There's an element of spontaneity to the show that just doesn't exist much anymore. ... There's this very strong sense of control that exists in American entertainment, broadly speaking, that didn't exist at the time of Soul Train .\"\n\nMcComb said that when the spirit of Soul Train truly returns, we likely won't see it through the same medium. \"It may not be on television that we will see protected spaces where people can be their authentic selves. I don't have much hope for American public entertainment to provide that space,\" she said.\n\nShe points out that one of the places where this kind of self-expression is seen most often is in spaces that fly under the radar of pop culture. \"When people take over warehouses and abandoned buildings and host parties there, that is a means of transgressing and rebelling against the structures and the controls of American capitalism. That's the closest thing I can think of to Soul Train .\"\n\nHowever, this isn't necessarily a negative for McComb (although she stresses that she doesn't endorse the takeover of abandoned buildings). \"We're at a saturation point in American entertainment where there's just so much messaging and stimuli, that maybe it is the lived experience of that unbridled authenticity that will have a revival.\"\n\nThe beauty of Soul Train was that \"it was the kind of unbridled celebration that you would see in your own home or in your own community, but on American television,\" McComb said. For now, then, offscreen, Soul Train lives on in the impromptu line dances we do at weddings, parties, and any function where Black people feel joy and freedom.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nHow Kristi Noem and Karoline Leavitt offer two visions of conservative femininity.\n\nDJs, club owners, and patrons alike say there's way too much standing around.\n\nAstrology's enormous appeal, explained for believers and skeptics.\n\nThe surprising truth about milk is hiding in plain sight.\n\n﻿From Dunkin' deodorant to Sabrina Carpenter perfume, smelling good isn't enough - it's all about smelling edible.\n\nA star-studded film explains the hope and hype behind regenerative agriculture.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe newest Marvel movie is about more than a superhero's journey. It's about black culture's journey.\n\nby Tre Johnson\n\nMarvel's Black Panther is a cultural phenomenon, a historic box office success that's brought in rave reviews and sparked conversation all over social media and traditional media alike. There are no signs of the excitement abating, either, as the conversation about the film has evolved from discussions about the importance of representation into something grander: a rather groundbreaking celebration of black culture.\n\nWith an all-star collection of majority black talent both in front of and behind the camera, Black Panther , under the direction of Ryan Coogler ( Fruitvale Station , Creed ), is about more than the latest superhero's journey; it's also about black culture's journey, and it points toward a future where it could be the culture. It acknowledges and celebrates everything from traditional African society to African-American political debates, from the power and beauty of black women to the preservation of identity, all within the lush confines of the fictional African nation of Wakanda.\n\nAll told, Black Panther 's greatest legacy may not be what it's done for Marvel, Hollywood, or box office records, but what it's done for the culture. In Wakanda, which offers much to marvel at for audiences of all backgrounds, black viewers in particular have found a cultural oasis that feels like nothing we've seen before.\n\nBlack Panther is in many ways a love letter to black culture. Africa has traditionally been an unsophisticated bit player in American media, often portrayed as backward, savage, and chaotic in everything from news coverage to films. It's a portrayal that has left little room for other interpretations, which is why Black Panther's vision of Wakanda as a bustling metropolis of vibranium-powered futuristic skyscrapers, racing trains, and soaring spaceships feels so refreshing.\n\nMarvel movies often take place in grand, imaginative locales, like Thor's Asgard or Guardians of the Galaxy' s far-flung planets. But nothing has been quite as audacious and poignant as Wakanda, a vision of Africa that feels indebted to both Jack Kirby and Octavia Butler, home to a thriving black population that represents our collective ingenuity and beauty. As a testament to black empowerment, Black Panther is an important artifact, but it's also, quite simply, a big draw for black moviegoers starved for this sort of vision.\n\nIt's not just Wakanda's skyline that makes an impact, though; the film drew on a team of designers and stylists to showcase a very specific, beautiful black aesthetic. In an interview with the New York Times, Camille Friend, who oversaw the various hair designs of what she calls \"a totally Afrocentric, natural hair movie,\" said the entire production was considered against a backdrop of a bigger black cultural moment: \"We're in a moment when people are feeling empowered about being black,\" she says. \"The hair helps communicate that.\"\n\nLike the film's hair, Black Panther 's costuming was an opportunity to infuse meaning and pride into the movie. As the film's head costume designer, Ruth Carter, shared with NPR , the costumes, like Wakanda itself, needed to evoke a place and people that had \"never been colonized, one that looked toward the future but was based on a real past.\"\n\nCarter and her team drew on Kenyan, Namibian, and South African reference points to complete the film's array of looks, reflecting not only the tribal diversity that exists within Wakanda but the diversity of black culture and identity as well. The film is a crucial stamp of validation for black people hungry for the opportunity to celebrate everything from Afrofuturism to the natural hair movement that's often been derided in mainstream spaces.\n\nThe care and intricacy of the film's styling carried a heavy price tag, with Marvel committing more money to Black Panther than its previous few films in order to achieve a visual splendor that's as exciting to the culture as it is to the eye. The result is the sort of spectacle black moviegoers rarely get to see in popular mainstream culture. That isn't lost on Marvel's Kevin Feige, who explained his reasoning behind the film's budget to Vulture : \"It's a big story that deserves to be told in a big way, for all of the cultural and political reasons that people talk about.\"\n\nThese vague \"cultural and political reasons\" are at the heart of a movie phenomenon that's inspired everything from Black Panther -themed watch parties to a voter registration initiative to a curriculum that encourages educators to leverage the film to teach deeper histories about African culture, politics, and history. It's also opened up dialogues and personal reflections about black identity in America and abroad via #WhatBlackPantherMeansToMe , a powerful cross section of editorial and real-time reflections on the film's resonance with black moviegoers.\n\nThe film has also jumped into the current of black political thought and action, prompting challenging think pieces about how T'Challa and Killmonger's rift is representative of familiar ideological debates in the black community, and what the film's politics represent about the state of black America . In addition to escapism and inspiration, Black Panther offers African Americans the opportunity to reexamine and reimagine their place in the world, both literally and figuratively. Wakanda has emerged as a vision of what's possible, representing what true liberation could look like, but the power of that fantasy is directly linked to the harsh realities of Erik Killmonger's experience growing up in Oakland, California, far away from that utopic vision.\n\nThe excitement around Black Panther doesn't exist in a vacuum; the film is the latest in a string of high-water-mark moments for a black pop culture landscape that's experiencing a renaissance. Recent years have seen a new level of black art that's intertwined sociopolitical commentary with high-caliber artistry: from Beyoncé's Lemonade and Kendrick Lamar's DAMN to Atlanta and Queen Sugar, there's been a renewed focus on telling stories that broaden and sharpen the range of black narratives.\n\nThis expansion is significant given black audiences' complex relationship with Hollywood, which has typically presented a narrow slice of the African-American narrative.

In its more than 900 episodes, it launched musicians like Teena Marie , Curtis Mayfield , and the Jackson Five , and others like Vivica A. Fox , Jody Watley , and Rosie Perez , to new heights of fame. Now, 54 years after the groundbreaking show's premiere, its impact on culture and history hasn't diminished.\n\nSoul Train was an ensemble show, featuring musicians, dancers, comedians, and special guests who came together to put on a grand show. It was glittery and glamorous, but also intimate and personal, with celebrities like Patti LaBelle , Elton John , and Little Richard mingling with the dancers in the audience. Simply put, you couldn't miss it. Richard Gay, the producer of a soon-to-be-on- Broadway musical called Soul Train , tells Vox, \"The day Soul Train was supposed to come on, we all knew we needed to have our chores done and everything together so we could watch. ... Then you got older and started tuning in so you could use the dances at the parties that weekend.\"\n\nI was too young to really engage with Soul Train during my childhood (and wasn't even alive during its peak). Still, its legacy lives on for me. From reruns, I can recall with ease the intro, with the animated train, the screech of \"The Soullll Trainnn!,\" and a smooth voice calling it \"the hippest trip in America.\" I have vivid memories of Don Cornelius, Soul Train 's founder and legendary \"conductor\" or host. And the iconic Soul Train line, where people make a corridor and one person has the spotlight, dancing wildly and passionately down the line as everyone claps and cheers, which showed up at so many of my family functions and parties at my alma mater, the historically Black Howard University. It's undeniable that Soul Train has been a huge part of my life, and that of many others, even long after it stopped airing.\n\nBethonie Butler, author of Black TV: Five Decades of Groundbreaking Television from Soul Train to Black-ish and Beyond , writes that the variety music program started as a local show on Chicago's WCIU , a TV station that's now part of The CW, featuring local musicians like Jerry Butler, the Chi-Lites, and the Emotions. The small local show, often described as the Black version of American Bandstand , an ensemble show that was once only for whites, quickly took off due to the culture's hunger for the show and its host's hunger for success. (Don Cornelius's son said Cornelius wanted to be the \"next Black Dick Clark,\" the host of American Bandstand .)\n\n\"Once people start to hear about it, then the big acts wanted to be a part of it. I know for a fact his initial bookings of the show were not the biggest acts,\" Tony Cornelius, Don's son, told KCRW . \"But the biggest acts decided that they wanted to be a part of it and it became the place to be, because everyone started to hear about this phenomenon.\"\n\nIts tremendous popularity - it remains the longest first-run syndicated television series in broadcast history - and a key partnership with Johnson Products , the makers of the Afro-Sheen hair care brand, led to its status as a radical show for the times, slotted next to commercials that proudly showcased natural hairstyles like glistening Afros and fluffy tresses in spite of the pressure for Black hair to conform to European standards. Suddenly it wasn't just Black music or dance on the national stage, but our hair as well.\n\nBlack fashion was also a huge part of the show's success. When people came on Soul Train , they dressed their best. Rich and bright colors, textured fabrics of thick satin and corduroy, dashikis and sequined blazers with shoulder pads and gleaming gold buttons, sharp angles and soft leathers. The fashion was unique and bright, consisting of bell bottoms, exaggerated collars, and flowy blouses. It was a richness of style that felt like seeing the best of ourselves in a time when Black people on TV were often reduced to minstrels - characters that exaggerate negative stereotypes of Black people - or weren't included at all.\n\nIn his 20s, when he was still working for WCIU, Don Cornelius reported on social unrest and met figures like Rev. Jesse Jackson and Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Tony Cornelius told KCRW , \"My father initially just wanted to do a show that presented Blacks in a positive light, because there was nothing like that going on. I mean, the only thing that you saw about African Americans was on the news where they were being arrested or something.\"\n\nIt was glittery and glamorous, but also intimate and personal\n\nGay, who stood in the lobby after every performance of his musical in the Bay Area, was surprised when Fredrika Newton, the widow of Huey P. Newton, co-founder of the revolutionary Black Panther Party who was murdered in 1989, came up to him to thank him for the nod in the show to the civil rights movement, including the Black Panther Party. \"She was almost in tears and she was like, 'Me and Huey used to watch Soul Train every Saturday. It would bring us joy.'\"\n\nCassie Taylor, a musician whose upbringing was greatly influenced by Soul Train and her father, blues musician Otis Taylor, told me, \"Black culture was demonized by the majority of white media, and Soul Train was a place for people to safely express themselves. ... It retains its iconicism because the joy is contagious.\" Taylor, who has had a supplemental business from flipping vintage clothing in the past, said her childhood memories of Soul Train informed what she looked for in vintage and thrift shops for her customers.\n\nEntertainers like Bill Withers, Al Green, Bobby Womack, Little Richard, Stevie Wonder, and Marvin Gaye all furthered their careers by appearing on the show. From Soul Train dancer Jeffrey Daniel, Michael Jackson learned the robot and \"backslide,\" which was renamed the moonwalk, Jackson's trademark dance. Part of Aretha Franklin's great fame came from her appearance on the show. After Don Cornelius's death in 2008, Franklin told ABC that \"An appearance on ' Soul Train' meant, what it could mean, a person being virtually an unknown person to an American sensation overnight, very similar to 'American Idol.'\" She said, \"It was like if you had a record that sold maybe 10,000 copies, to be on ' Soul Train ' meant it might sell 100 to 200- to 300- or even 500,000 or more.\"\n\nDespite - or perhaps because of - its emphasis on joy and togetherness, Soul Train was a response to an incredibly bleak time for Black Americans . When it premiered in 1970 in Chicago , Black Americans like my grandparents were still fleeing racial terror and poverty in the South as part of the Great Migration. Segregation had ended legally, but its disastrous effects were still felt in Black communities everywhere.\n\nVeronica McComb, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Bryant University, told me in an interview that \"Black bodies were constantly in danger to a high degree. To be in a safe and protected space to express themselves physically in the form of dress and dance was just, as they say, it was everything.\"\n\nSoul Train premiered at a time when those who had already migrated were still trying to find community and navigate new racial discrimination in different contexts. \"If you're away from home, like many African Americans were as part of the Great Migration, Soul Train definitely gave you that stronger sense of home,\" McComb said. The act of watching became not only a space to gather but a conversation point the next morning at school or work, a way for Black people to find each other in all spaces.\n\nSegregation continued socially, with Black people being chased out of white neighborhoods and schools, while Black neighborhoods and schools remaining overpoliced and underfunded. Lynchings continued, and sundown towns didn't cease their violence toward Black people. Meanwhile, those who managed to integrate faced their own set of challenges - some of which were intensified. \"Integration wasn't necessarily the wonderful thing that it was intended to be in terms of creating better equity and equality for African Americans,\" McComb said. \"In some cases, it created a lot of inequity and even more discrimination. ... Soul Train having a space for African Americans was a form of resistance against the forces that would say, 'You are still not equal; you are still not valued.' It was a way to say, 'Yes, we are indeed.'\"\n\n\"There's an element of spontaneity to the show that just doesn't exist much anymore\"\n\nFor most of its airing, non-Black performers and guests on Soul Train were rare. \"It had to be a very particular type of entertainer that was valued by the Black community to be accepted onto Soul Train, because it was such a protected space for Black expression and Black entertainment,\" McComb said.\n\nGay's Soul Train musical delves into the entrepreneur and visionary Don Cornelius's biggest project. \"He was a kingmaker, right? At the show's height, you had people like Elton John going, 'I have this giant audience that knows 'Crocodile Rock' that doesn't look like me. How do I reach them? Well, Soul Train was the answer to that,\" said Gay.\n\nOn May 17, 1975, Elton John became the first white performer to appear on the show. After that, Soul Train became a sort of litmus test for all musicians but especially white ones. There was a difference between only making music for white people and making music that Black people could jive to as well, a sort of encapsulation of the radicalism of Soul Train. Here, in this integrated space, Black folks made the culture and determined who could cross over into our spaces, an act that truly could transform singers and widen their audience.\n\nIt was also a time when popular forms of Black creativity were more accessible. It didn't cost three months' rent to see our biggest stars in concert, and spending hundreds on an outfit was unheard of. Pictures of Soul Train from its height show the special environment it cultivated. One in particular shows Marvin Gaye in the crowd , at the audience's level, smiling and interacting as equals. The fashion was textured, layered, quality, and unique. It was a kind of fashion culture that would be hard to reproduce today because the way we make and consume clothes - in factories with labor exploitation, producing waste that is contributing mightily to the existential climate crisis , and simply making clothes less stylish - has changed radically, for the very worst.\n\nWe are in a similar state of despair as the one that Soul Train was born out of. Covid-19 isolated people for months and killed more than a million Americans. Economic instability and student loan debt are crushing people's hopes for the future. Police brutality is a constant worry for Black people and other marginalized groups. Our court system appears ever more imperiled . We are watching devastating violence take place overseas. This has all taken a tremendous toll on the collective psyche. In the face of such despair, it's natural that people express a rising dissent against the disappointments of this world, and are actively looking for artistic spaces to express that dissent. \"We are in a post-pandemic world and we need a reboot of Soul Train ,\" Taylor says, adding that the horrors of late-stage capitalism make this more urgent.\n\nSoul Train was revolutionary, but Cornelius was a skilled businessman who went after numbers. Yet Soul Train feels anti-capitalist in some ways in retrospect, not because it was created that way, but because we live in a more flagrantly exploitative and consumerist society than ever before. The show was still revolutionary because of its assertion of Black people's right to joy and unbridled expression in the face of forces meant to destroy our bodies and souls.\n\nMuch of why people loved Soul Train was the intimacy and spontaneity. We live in a time when much of our culture is intensely curated by algorithms and trends, where fast fashion and cosmetic surgeries have produced an eerie sense of sameness, and when public images are more carefully managed than ever before, making it difficult to assess who artists truly are. \" Soul Train wasn't very structured,\" said McComb. \"There's an element of spontaneity to the show that just doesn't exist much anymore. ... There's this very strong sense of control that exists in American entertainment, broadly speaking, that didn't exist at the time of Soul Train .\"\n\nMcComb said that when the spirit of Soul Train truly returns, we likely won't see it through the same medium. \"It may not be on television that we will see protected spaces where people can be their authentic selves. I don't have much hope for American public entertainment to provide that space,\" she said.\n\nShe points out that one of the places where this kind of self-expression is seen most often is in spaces that fly under the radar of pop culture. \"When people take over warehouses and abandoned buildings and host parties there, that is a means of transgressing and rebelling against the structures and the controls of American capitalism. That's the closest thing I can think of to Soul Train .\"\n\nHowever, this isn't necessarily a negative for McComb (although she stresses that she doesn't endorse the takeover of abandoned buildings). \"We're at a saturation point in American entertainment where there's just so much messaging and stimuli, that maybe it is the lived experience of that unbridled authenticity that will have a revival.\"\n\nThe beauty of Soul Train was that \"it was the kind of unbridled celebration that you would see in your own home or in your own community, but on American television,\" McComb said. For now, then, offscreen, Soul Train lives on in the impromptu line dances we do at weddings, parties, and any function where Black people feel joy and freedom.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nHow Kristi Noem and Karoline Leavitt offer two visions of conservative femininity.\n\nDJs, club owners, and patrons alike say there's way too much standing around.\n\nAstrology's enormous appeal, explained for believers and skeptics.\n\nThe surprising truth about milk is hiding in plain sight.\n\n﻿From Dunkin' deodorant to Sabrina Carpenter perfume, smelling good isn't enough - it's all about smelling edible.\n\nA star-studded film explains the hope and hype behind regenerative agriculture.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe newest Marvel movie is about more than a superhero's journey. It's about black culture's journey.\n\nby Tre Johnson\n\nMarvel's Black Panther is a cultural phenomenon, a historic box office success that's brought in rave reviews and sparked conversation all over social media and traditional media alike. There are no signs of the excitement abating, either, as the conversation about the film has evolved from discussions about the importance of representation into something grander: a rather groundbreaking celebration of black culture.\n\nWith an all-star collection of majority black talent both in front of and behind the camera, Black Panther , under the direction of Ryan Coogler ( Fruitvale Station , Creed ), is about more than the latest superhero's journey; it's also about black culture's journey, and it points toward a future where it could be the culture. It acknowledges and celebrates everything from traditional African society to African-American political debates, from the power and beauty of black women to the preservation of identity, all within the lush confines of the fictional African nation of Wakanda.\n\nAll told, Black Panther 's greatest legacy may not be what it's done for Marvel, Hollywood, or box office records, but what it's done for the culture. In Wakanda, which offers much to marvel at for audiences of all backgrounds, black viewers in particular have found a cultural oasis that feels like nothing we've seen before.\n\nBlack Panther is in many ways a love letter to black culture. Africa has traditionally been an unsophisticated bit player in American media, often portrayed as backward, savage, and chaotic in everything from news coverage to films. It's a portrayal that has left little room for other interpretations, which is why Black Panther's vision of Wakanda as a bustling metropolis of vibranium-powered futuristic skyscrapers, racing trains, and soaring spaceships feels so refreshing.\n\nMarvel movies often take place in grand, imaginative locales, like Thor's Asgard or Guardians of the Galaxy' s far-flung planets. But nothing has been quite as audacious and poignant as Wakanda, a vision of Africa that feels indebted to both Jack Kirby and Octavia Butler, home to a thriving black population that represents our collective ingenuity and beauty. As a testament to black empowerment, Black Panther is an important artifact, but it's also, quite simply, a big draw for black moviegoers starved for this sort of vision.\n\nIt's not just Wakanda's skyline that makes an impact, though; the film drew on a team of designers and stylists to showcase a very specific, beautiful black aesthetic. In an interview with the New York Times, Camille Friend, who oversaw the various hair designs of what she calls \"a totally Afrocentric, natural hair movie,\" said the entire production was considered against a backdrop of a bigger black cultural moment: \"We're in a moment when people are feeling empowered about being black,\" she says. \"The hair helps communicate that.\"\n\nLike the film's hair, Black Panther 's costuming was an opportunity to infuse meaning and pride into the movie. As the film's head costume designer, Ruth Carter, shared with NPR , the costumes, like Wakanda itself, needed to evoke a place and people that had \"never been colonized, one that looked toward the future but was based on a real past.\"\n\nCarter and her team drew on Kenyan, Namibian, and South African reference points to complete the film's array of looks, reflecting not only the tribal diversity that exists within Wakanda but the diversity of black culture and identity as well. The film is a crucial stamp of validation for black people hungry for the opportunity to celebrate everything from Afrofuturism to the natural hair movement that's often been derided in mainstream spaces.\n\nThe care and intricacy of the film's styling carried a heavy price tag, with Marvel committing more money to Black Panther than its previous few films in order to achieve a visual splendor that's as exciting to the culture as it is to the eye. The result is the sort of spectacle black moviegoers rarely get to see in popular mainstream culture. That isn't lost on Marvel's Kevin Feige, who explained his reasoning behind the film's budget to Vulture : \"It's a big story that deserves to be told in a big way, for all of the cultural and political reasons that people talk about.\"\n\nThese vague \"cultural and political reasons\" are at the heart of a movie phenomenon that's inspired everything from Black Panther -themed watch parties to a voter registration initiative to a curriculum that encourages educators to leverage the film to teach deeper histories about African culture, politics, and history. It's also opened up dialogues and personal reflections about black identity in America and abroad via #WhatBlackPantherMeansToMe , a powerful cross section of editorial and real-time reflections on the film's resonance with black moviegoers.\n\nThe film has also jumped into the current of black political thought and action, prompting challenging think pieces about how T'Challa and Killmonger's rift is representative of familiar ideological debates in the black community, and what the film's politics represent about the state of black America . In addition to escapism and inspiration, Black Panther offers African Americans the opportunity to reexamine and reimagine their place in the world, both literally and figuratively. Wakanda has emerged as a vision of what's possible, representing what true liberation could look like, but the power of that fantasy is directly linked to the harsh realities of Erik Killmonger's experience growing up in Oakland, California, far away from that utopic vision.\n\nThe excitement around Black Panther doesn't exist in a vacuum; the film is the latest in a string of high-water-mark moments for a black pop culture landscape that's experiencing a renaissance. Recent years have seen a new level of black art that's intertwined sociopolitical commentary with high-caliber artistry: from Beyoncé's Lemonade and Kendrick Lamar's DAMN to Atlanta and Queen Sugar, there's been a renewed focus on telling stories that broaden and sharpen the range of black narratives.\n\nThis expansion is significant given black audiences' complex relationship with Hollywood, which has typically presented a narrow slice of the African-American narrative. It's an industry that has often seemed invested in black Americans primarily as slaves ( 12 Years a Slave ), victims of inner-city strife ( Detroit ), or symbols of comfort ( The Help ) and is fixated on stories about the post-Reconstruction and civil rights eras and biopics of famous black people that only glimpse at race .\n\nFor a long time, it's felt like the only stories about the African-American experience Hollywood was interested in telling were stories that were intertwined in some way with the white experience, making this shift toward stories that center black narratives as black narratives feel both welcome and long overdue.\n\nA similar shift has been afoot in Hollywood offscreen in recent years. As #OscarsSoWhite launched a debate about the industry's fidelity to representation and valuing nonwhite contributions, filmmakers like Moonlight 's Barry Jenkins, A Wrinkle in Time 's Ava DuVernay, and Get Out 's Jordan Peele have taken crucial pole positions as visionaries who are pushing the boundaries of black representation on film. Coogler's Black Panther joins these projects as a missing piece: a popcorn movie that uses the most mainstream of film genres - the superhero movie - to project the complexity of black identity, politics, and creativity.\n\nThe renewed conversation around race that Black Panther enters into extends beyond the entertainment industry. As the first black superhero film in a cinematic universe that's spent the past decade focused primarily on white superheroes, it underlines the chasm that exists between society's treatment of black Americans and white Americans.\n\nIn many ways, black bodies have experienced a renewed series of attacks in recent years.

I mean, the only thing that you saw about African Americans was on the news where they were being arrested or something.\"\n\nIt was glittery and glamorous, but also intimate and personal\n\nGay, who stood in the lobby after every performance of his musical in the Bay Area, was surprised when Fredrika Newton, the widow of Huey P. Newton, co-founder of the revolutionary Black Panther Party who was murdered in 1989, came up to him to thank him for the nod in the show to the civil rights movement, including the Black Panther Party. \"She was almost in tears and she was like, 'Me and Huey used to watch Soul Train every Saturday. It would bring us joy.'\"\n\nCassie Taylor, a musician whose upbringing was greatly influenced by Soul Train and her father, blues musician Otis Taylor, told me, \"Black culture was demonized by the majority of white media, and Soul Train was a place for people to safely express themselves. ... It retains its iconicism because the joy is contagious.\" Taylor, who has had a supplemental business from flipping vintage clothing in the past, said her childhood memories of Soul Train informed what she looked for in vintage and thrift shops for her customers.\n\nEntertainers like Bill Withers, Al Green, Bobby Womack, Little Richard, Stevie Wonder, and Marvin Gaye all furthered their careers by appearing on the show. From Soul Train dancer Jeffrey Daniel, Michael Jackson learned the robot and \"backslide,\" which was renamed the moonwalk, Jackson's trademark dance. Part of Aretha Franklin's great fame came from her appearance on the show. After Don Cornelius's death in 2008, Franklin told ABC that \"An appearance on ' Soul Train' meant, what it could mean, a person being virtually an unknown person to an American sensation overnight, very similar to 'American Idol.'\" She said, \"It was like if you had a record that sold maybe 10,000 copies, to be on ' Soul Train ' meant it might sell 100 to 200- to 300- or even 500,000 or more.\"\n\nDespite - or perhaps because of - its emphasis on joy and togetherness, Soul Train was a response to an incredibly bleak time for Black Americans . When it premiered in 1970 in Chicago , Black Americans like my grandparents were still fleeing racial terror and poverty in the South as part of the Great Migration. Segregation had ended legally, but its disastrous effects were still felt in Black communities everywhere.\n\nVeronica McComb, dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at Bryant University, told me in an interview that \"Black bodies were constantly in danger to a high degree. To be in a safe and protected space to express themselves physically in the form of dress and dance was just, as they say, it was everything.\"\n\nSoul Train premiered at a time when those who had already migrated were still trying to find community and navigate new racial discrimination in different contexts. \"If you're away from home, like many African Americans were as part of the Great Migration, Soul Train definitely gave you that stronger sense of home,\" McComb said. The act of watching became not only a space to gather but a conversation point the next morning at school or work, a way for Black people to find each other in all spaces.\n\nSegregation continued socially, with Black people being chased out of white neighborhoods and schools, while Black neighborhoods and schools remaining overpoliced and underfunded. Lynchings continued, and sundown towns didn't cease their violence toward Black people. Meanwhile, those who managed to integrate faced their own set of challenges - some of which were intensified. \"Integration wasn't necessarily the wonderful thing that it was intended to be in terms of creating better equity and equality for African Americans,\" McComb said. \"In some cases, it created a lot of inequity and even more discrimination. ... Soul Train having a space for African Americans was a form of resistance against the forces that would say, 'You are still not equal; you are still not valued.' It was a way to say, 'Yes, we are indeed.'\"\n\n\"There's an element of spontaneity to the show that just doesn't exist much anymore\"\n\nFor most of its airing, non-Black performers and guests on Soul Train were rare. \"It had to be a very particular type of entertainer that was valued by the Black community to be accepted onto Soul Train, because it was such a protected space for Black expression and Black entertainment,\" McComb said.\n\nGay's Soul Train musical delves into the entrepreneur and visionary Don Cornelius's biggest project. \"He was a kingmaker, right? At the show's height, you had people like Elton John going, 'I have this giant audience that knows 'Crocodile Rock' that doesn't look like me. How do I reach them? Well, Soul Train was the answer to that,\" said Gay.\n\nOn May 17, 1975, Elton John became the first white performer to appear on the show. After that, Soul Train became a sort of litmus test for all musicians but especially white ones. There was a difference between only making music for white people and making music that Black people could jive to as well, a sort of encapsulation of the radicalism of Soul Train. Here, in this integrated space, Black folks made the culture and determined who could cross over into our spaces, an act that truly could transform singers and widen their audience.\n\nIt was also a time when popular forms of Black creativity were more accessible. It didn't cost three months' rent to see our biggest stars in concert, and spending hundreds on an outfit was unheard of. Pictures of Soul Train from its height show the special environment it cultivated. One in particular shows Marvin Gaye in the crowd , at the audience's level, smiling and interacting as equals. The fashion was textured, layered, quality, and unique. It was a kind of fashion culture that would be hard to reproduce today because the way we make and consume clothes - in factories with labor exploitation, producing waste that is contributing mightily to the existential climate crisis , and simply making clothes less stylish - has changed radically, for the very worst.\n\nWe are in a similar state of despair as the one that Soul Train was born out of. Covid-19 isolated people for months and killed more than a million Americans. Economic instability and student loan debt are crushing people's hopes for the future. Police brutality is a constant worry for Black people and other marginalized groups. Our court system appears ever more imperiled . We are watching devastating violence take place overseas. This has all taken a tremendous toll on the collective psyche. In the face of such despair, it's natural that people express a rising dissent against the disappointments of this world, and are actively looking for artistic spaces to express that dissent. \"We are in a post-pandemic world and we need a reboot of Soul Train ,\" Taylor says, adding that the horrors of late-stage capitalism make this more urgent.\n\nSoul Train was revolutionary, but Cornelius was a skilled businessman who went after numbers. Yet Soul Train feels anti-capitalist in some ways in retrospect, not because it was created that way, but because we live in a more flagrantly exploitative and consumerist society than ever before. The show was still revolutionary because of its assertion of Black people's right to joy and unbridled expression in the face of forces meant to destroy our bodies and souls.\n\nMuch of why people loved Soul Train was the intimacy and spontaneity. We live in a time when much of our culture is intensely curated by algorithms and trends, where fast fashion and cosmetic surgeries have produced an eerie sense of sameness, and when public images are more carefully managed than ever before, making it difficult to assess who artists truly are. \" Soul Train wasn't very structured,\" said McComb. \"There's an element of spontaneity to the show that just doesn't exist much anymore. ... There's this very strong sense of control that exists in American entertainment, broadly speaking, that didn't exist at the time of Soul Train .\"\n\nMcComb said that when the spirit of Soul Train truly returns, we likely won't see it through the same medium. \"It may not be on television that we will see protected spaces where people can be their authentic selves. I don't have much hope for American public entertainment to provide that space,\" she said.\n\nShe points out that one of the places where this kind of self-expression is seen most often is in spaces that fly under the radar of pop culture. \"When people take over warehouses and abandoned buildings and host parties there, that is a means of transgressing and rebelling against the structures and the controls of American capitalism. That's the closest thing I can think of to Soul Train .\"\n\nHowever, this isn't necessarily a negative for McComb (although she stresses that she doesn't endorse the takeover of abandoned buildings). \"We're at a saturation point in American entertainment where there's just so much messaging and stimuli, that maybe it is the lived experience of that unbridled authenticity that will have a revival.\"\n\nThe beauty of Soul Train was that \"it was the kind of unbridled celebration that you would see in your own home or in your own community, but on American television,\" McComb said. For now, then, offscreen, Soul Train lives on in the impromptu line dances we do at weddings, parties, and any function where Black people feel joy and freedom.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nHow Kristi Noem and Karoline Leavitt offer two visions of conservative femininity.\n\nDJs, club owners, and patrons alike say there's way too much standing around.\n\nAstrology's enormous appeal, explained for believers and skeptics.\n\nThe surprising truth about milk is hiding in plain sight.\n\n﻿From Dunkin' deodorant to Sabrina Carpenter perfume, smelling good isn't enough - it's all about smelling edible.\n\nA star-studded film explains the hope and hype behind regenerative agriculture.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

(\"Ain't that about a bitch?\" she added, with a tiny but telling smirk.) But even if she hadn't literally said it, every single minute of her set was imbued with her acknowledgment of that fact, which was, as the New Yorker's Doreen St. Félix put it , \"an education in black expression.\"\n\nThroughout the two-hour set, St. Félix writes, Beyoncé put on a show that honored \"New Orleans and its horns, Houston and its chopped and screwed beats, Brooklyn and its rap velocity, Kingston and its dancehall, and Nigeria and the legacy of its dissenter, Fela Kuti.\" At one point, she sang a heartfelt rendition of \"Lift Every Voice and Sing,\" a song rooted in the civil rights movement that is commonly referred to as the \"black national anthem.\"\n\nSurrounded by black dancers and musicians, Beyoncé was purposeful and direct about her influences and what she wanted to pay homage to - and she did so in front of a predominantly white crowd that mostly failed to pick up the references.\n\nBut that, according to her mother, Tina Knowles-Lawson, was exactly the point.\n\n\"I told Beyonce that I was afraid that the predominately white audience at Coachella would be confused by all of the black culture and Black college culture because it was something that they might not get,\" Knowles-Lawson wrote on Instagram the Monday after her daughter's performance. \"Her brave response to me made me feel a bit selfish and ashamed.\"\n\nKnowles-Lawson said Beyoncé told her that she wanted to use her platform to elevate and educate people, to do \"what's best for the world and not what is most popular.\" In fact, Knowles-Lawson added, Beyoncé deliberately referenced the aesthetics of historically black colleges and universities in order to encourage more people to go there - a wish she quickly backed up by announcing that she will sponsor scholarships to Xavier, Wilberforce, Tuskegee, and Bethune-Cookman universities this year.\n\n\"[Beyoncé] said that her hope is that after the show young people would research this culture and see how cool it is,\" Knowles-Lawson continued in her Instagram post, \"and young people black and white would listen to LIFT EVERY VOICE AND SING and see how amazing the words are for us all and bridge the gap.\"\n\nIn centering black traditions in such a spectacular way for the Coachella audience, Beyoncé made sure that they - not to mention those watching the live stream around the world - wouldn't just have an amazing time at the show but would actually learn something while she had their undivided attention.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nHow Kristi Noem and Karoline Leavitt offer two visions of conservative femininity.\n\nDJs, club owners, and patrons alike say there's way too much standing around.\n\nAstrology's enormous appeal, explained for believers and skeptics.\n\nThe surprising truth about milk is hiding in plain sight.\n\n﻿From Dunkin' deodorant to Sabrina Carpenter perfume, smelling good isn't enough - it's all about smelling edible.\n\nA star-studded film explains the hope and hype behind regenerative agriculture.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

      "text": "White hip-hop artists navigate line between art and cultural appropriation\n\nThe hip-hop community saw some acts as not embracing the genre's Black roots.\n\nFor over 50 years, the hip-hop world has presented fans with hits that have reflected Black culture.\n\nBut as the genre grew, several big-name white artists such as the Beastie Boys and Eminem rose to the top of the charts.\n\n\"In the '80s, the majority of hip-hop fans were urban Black kids. In the early '90s, it starts to shift and it becomes suburban white boys and the music industry shifts to cater to what they want,\" music journalist and author Touré told ABC News Live.\n\nBut as more white artists began to make a name for themselves on the radio, some, like Bubba Sparxxx, acknowledged that there is a very fine line to walk as they contribute to the genre they love without appropriating the Black culture that created it.\n\n\"As a white boy, there are certain doors that being white, that you'll automatically get in, that perhaps no Black person or other race could ever get in. But there's also certain doors as a white boy that you can never get in. No matter what,\" Sparxxx, whose real name is Warren Anderson Mathis, told ABC News Live.\n\nTouré said the first mainstream white hip-hop group was the Beastie Boys, who broke out with their 1986 album \"Licensed to Ill.\" Touré noted that the band mixed punk and hip-hop and introduced the latter genre to others.\n\n\"For a lot of people, the Beastie Boys are a gateway drug. They brought a lot of white fans in who loved the Beasties and then become genuine fans of other artists,\" he said.\n\nWhile some white artists like Vanilla Ice had success with their hip-hop albums, Touré said that the hip-hop community saw their acts as not fully embracing the genre's Black roots.\n\n\"The Beastie Boys seem to be wanting to be part of hip-hop culture and the hip-hop community. Vanilla Ice was clearly not,\" he said.\n\nEminem's breakout success in the late '90s was mostly welcomed within the Black community, Touré said, because not only was he talented, but he showed respect for the Black artists who led the way before him, including Dr. Dre, who discovered and produced some of his work.\n\nHowever, music experts said the widespread popularity of hip-hop has raised questions about who can and should thrive in a space created by Black artists.\n\nIn 2014, the Grammys sparked controversy among fans after Macklemore and Ryan Lewis beat out Kendrick Lamar for Best Rap Album.\n\nMacklemore reportedly texted Lamar after the ceremony telling him, \"You got robbed.\"\n\nBay Area hip-hop artist G-Eazy told ABC News Live he is aware that the privilege he has as a white man has benefited his career. However, the artist, whose real name is Gerald Earl Gillum, said he makes it a point to honor the Black community in his albums.\n\n\"As a white person in hip-hop now...I get to contribute to a culture that I grew up in and that I have a great love and respect for. And I'm very appreciative and grateful for, like, all that I've gotten to do in this space,\" he said.\n\nG-Eazy noted that he has had fellow Bay Area artist E-40 on every album he's put out and continues to collaborate with other Black artists in the genre.\n\n\"At the end of the day, doing things with true intention and for the right reasons with integrity, it's the place I come from,\" he said.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "The rich and beautiful history of HBCU majorette teams\n\nMajorette dance teams echo the importance of dance to Black culture.\n\nBeyoncé's 2018 Coachella performance broke the internet with its powerful homage to historically Black colleges and universities, or HBCUs, particularly their band culture.\n\nA year later, she released the Netflix film \"Homecoming,\" giving viewers a behind the scenes look into the performance, finding inspiration from HBCU bands to formulate the marching band theme, outfits and even the title of the documentary.\n\n\"I always dreamed of going to an HBCU,\" she said in the film.\n\nWhile the singer didn't play an instrument during her performance, the choreography was heavily influenced by an integral part of any HBCU band: the majorettes.\n\nDerived from the Dutch word \"Dansmarietjes,\" the original majorettes were carnival dancers who twirled batons in their performances. When the style reached the American South, it morphed into what HBCUs know today.\n\n\"I think it is a mix of pop culture dance and other expressions through movement that is done on the fields with a marching band,\" said Traci Greene, coach of the Southern University Dancing Dolls and a former Dancing Doll majorette herself.\n\nMajorette dancers mix multiple styles of dancing, including jazz, hip-hop, ballet, burlesque, cabaret, kick lines and more, to entertain audiences while simultaneously honoring the dancers who came before them.\n\n\"I think if you can define it, it's a dancer who cannot be defined,\" said Sydney Clark, a fourth-year member of North Carolina A &T State University's Golden Delight auxiliary majorette team. \"It's a person who is doing things with their body that physically or mentally you can't really comprehend, but physically you can't take your eyes off of them.\"\n\nPerformances by majorette teams are often grand, with props, bright outfits, cohesive hairstyles, tricks and dances in collaboration with their school's band song selections, which often reflect Black culture on HBCU campuses.\n\nAlthough Beyoncé's tribute to HBCU majorette culture was the first time some people were exposed to the lifestyle, the first known majorette performance dates back to 1968.\n\nThe 1968 Orange Blossom Classic, an annual HBCU football sporting event in Florida, hosted the first known majorette performance with the introduction of Alcorn State University's Golden Girls majorette team. Gloria Gray Liggans was a part of the original eight dancers on the line.\n\n\"I don't think any of us really thought it would bloom or be what it is right now,\" Liggans said, \"We were just college students wanting to be a part of the band. Maybe perform at home games, travel some.\"\n\nLiggans, along with the other original seven girls -- Mar Deen Bingham Boykin, Delores Black Jenkins, Patricia Gibbs, Barbara Heidelberg Fox, Paulette McClain Moore, Josephine Washington Parker and Margaret Bacchus Wilson -- made their debut with \"long, golden boots and gold capes\" at the halftime show with their team against Florida A &M University , Essence reported in November.\n\nAccording to Liggans, the vision came directly from band director Samuel S. Griffin after seeing Notre Dame University's band perform with a \"twirler\" who wore a gold performance costume.\n\n\"I give all the accolades to the band director, it was all him,\" Liggans added. \"It wasn't us, it was him. He had the idea and the vision, and he said it was a blessing that it went forward.\"\n\nAlmost 55 years after that December 1968 game, majorette culture has grown in popularity from TikTok trends to being featured in Vice President Kamala Harris ' inauguration procession.\n\n\"It actually doesn't surprise me at all because I feel like Black culture and music has always had such a broad reach in the world,\" Greene said. \"I guess the natural transition would be that HBCU culture is now what's popular.\"\n\nGreene started as the coach of Southern's Dancing Dolls last year but shared she'd been a Dancing Doll herself while she was an undergrad student and captain of the team from 1993-1995.\n\nFor those involved in HBCU culture, majorette dance is important not only to the campus but to Black culture as a whole, adding to the connection between Black people and dance in general.\n\n\"I feel like it's something we have kept in our culture because looking at African roots, dancing has always been a part,\" Liggans said.\n\nGreene views the dance style as a Black dancer's \"voice through movement.\"\n\n\"For a culture whose voice has been stifled for decades in our history, movement and song and things like that, creative movement is the only way we could truly express ourselves through joy, through whatever emotional turmoil we were going through,\" she said. \"It's extremely important in Black culture and in HBCU culture.\"\n\nAlthough majorette culture combines new dance styles with old dance styles, majorettes hope to reach each generation with a strong connection to the culture that started it.\n\n\"I think this space is not only important but necessary,\" Clark said. \"It's a space of freedom. I think it's a space to express yourself, and with music that is so important to our culture.\n\nAlthough majorettes primarily focus on dance and entertainment, its growing exposure through social media has served as an inspiration for some young people to want to go to college.\n\n\"I love the fact that little Black girls want to be like me,\" Clark said. \"That is such an amazing feeling to have because it not only allows them to continue to dance but it allows them the opportunity to go to school. I think pushing college into Black communities is very, very, very important.\"\n\nThere are around 100 HBCUs in the U.S., and HBCUs account for almost 20% of all African American graduates, according to the United Negro College Fund.\n\nWhile other colleges have seen a decline in enrollment, HBCUs have seen a steady increase in enrollment in recent years.\n\n\"The thing I'm most delighted about is [majorette culture is] bringing attention to HBCUs so that people will attend [them] and consider getting a very high-quality education from [them] just by seeing the dance line,\" Greene said.\n\nJunior Jakayla Lofton has been a part of Alcorn State University's Golden Girls since 2021 and said that being a part of the team has allowed her to grow as a dancer -- and as a woman.\n\n\"You can talk to anybody, no matter what time they came in or year they came in, it doesn't matter,\" she said. \"The Golden Girls didn't really just teach me dance, they taught me real-life lessons. They taught me how to become a woman, a better friend, a better sister, and I will never ever forget those moments.\"\n\nHBCUs have traditionally been home to the Divine Nine Greek fraternities and sororities , but they're also home to the honorary band fraternity Kappa Kappa Psi and sorority Tau Beta Sigma, which serve campuses as well.\n\nClark, a Spring 2020 initiate into the Theta Zeta chapter of Tau Beta Sigma, agrees that through her sorority and majorette dancing, she was able to grow as a person and learn things she otherwise would not have.\n\n\"I think that when I go out into the world, I am at a higher level because I've been disciplined to be at that higher level through band and through that sisterhood,\" she said. \"The fact that you get to be in this safe space with people who equally love music just as much as you do is such a necessary thing to have at HBCUs.\"\n\nMajorette performances are high energy, with continuous stand routines throughout football games and a halftime show on the football field.\n\nMost dancers practice like professional athletes , with \"rigorous dance schedules,\" according to Greene, drastic diet changes, workouts that include cardio and weight lifting, and extensive travel schedules during football season and off-season.\n\n\"It's not just something where you can train for a week and be ready to hit the field. We train all summer like it's a professional sport,\" Clark said.\n\nDespite the hard work that goes into being a majorette dancer on HBCU campuses, the passion of these dancers never seems to waver.\n\n\"You can have no choice but to give it your all and leave your mark on the field,\" Lofton said. \"I hope they can see my passion. I hope they can see how much I love to be here, and I hope to inspire younger dancers to be in [this] place ... to entice you to look at me and look how I'm loving it and to come and join us.\"\n\nThe growth in popularity of HBCU bands has landed them performances worldwide, including at NFL games and Disney World events.\n\nThe spread of HBCU majorette culture encourages those involved to help educate those curious on how to join.\n\n\"We have to try to keep our culture alive, and it seems like HBCUs are the ones who are trying to keep [it up],\" Liggans said. \"Not down the culture or demean it in any way. They try to uplift it and appreciate it because that is our culture.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Follow her @ebonyladelle and @coloringbookslit .\n\nHappy Black History (29-days-in-February-because-we-got-a-leap-year) Month!\n\nBlack History Month is a reminder of the strides Black Americans have made in this country despite the cards we've been dealt, and it's also a month to display the pride we feel as a people -- that in spite of what we've endured, we're still able to overcome so much, birth beautiful art, find joy, and celebrate us and our contributions to society, showing the true resilience of a community.\n\nBlack culture is American culture, and with book bans spreading throughout the United States , it's vital we all do our part to make sure teenagers are reading books that show a breadth of experiences so that they can feel seen or begin to understand the world around them, a world in desperate need of their voice and advocacy to create the changes they're looking to see in their lifetimes.\n\nDespite the many avenues available to consume Black history and culture in today's world -- through social media posts, TV, movies, and podcasts -- such topics are not always taught fully in schools, and some teens graduate high school without learning about all of the barriers Black people have faced throughout history and the inequalities many experience daily. Reading about an experience depicted by a Black author can help shatter stereotypes and give young people a richer understanding of what it means to be Black.\n\nIn general, reading as a practice is also one that offers benefits for all, including potentially reducing stress and helping strengthen brain health in young people. A small study published in the Journal of American College Health in 2022 proposed that \"recreational reading was associated with reduced psychological distress\" and \"improved mental health\" among Canadian university students across the school year, and a study published in the journal International Psychogeriatrics in 2021 suggested that reading may even help prevent cognitive decline later in life, regardless of education level. Additionally, an analysis of five studies published in the journal PLOS One in 2022 discussed how \"recalling, reading, and discussing fiction\" might potentially \"have a positive impact on measures of mood and emotion.\"\n\nBelow are 10 young adult reads that are perfect for Black History Month and beyond. In this list, you'll find a 128-page biography, a short horror story collection where Black girls get respectable endings, novels in verse and graphic novels that are short but leave a mark, as well as romance that will carry you away, all written by Black authors.\n\nScroll to check them out.\n\nStarting us out with a little joy, I'm recommending my own book, \"Love Radio,\" in audiobook form -- because while I have trouble gushing about it, I can gush about it being an Audie Awards finalist for 2023, with Joniece Abbott-Pratt and JaQwan J. Kelly lending their incredible voices to this read. \"Love Radio\" is a story of two teens who meet at the Detroit Public Library and fall for one another after three dates, but at its core, \"Love Radio\" is also so much more. It's a story of community, of two Black teenagers who are allowed to be imperfect and the friends and family that hold them down, even if they may not look like your typical American family. It's a story of love -- for a person, your family, your city, but most importantly, yourself.\n\nThis novelization of the Civil Rights activist's adolescence begins with a young Malcolm making a dumb decision that lands him in prison. It's in these dire circumstances that he self-reflects and finds his path through vignettes of things he learned as a child. His father, also an activist, told Malcolm at an early age he'd be a leader, and Malcolm held on to those lessons and affirmations as he befriended other inmates, read everything he could get his hands on as he began to understand the importance of education, and discovered Islam with his siblings and maintained a close relationship with them, even while incarcerated. It's also where he began to gain a deeper understanding of the world around him and how he'd be treated as a Black man, which led to him turning into the activist he ultimately became. A great introduction into learning the young life of Malcolm X before he became a prominent figure, co-authored by his daughter Ilyasah Shabazz and Tiffany D. Jackson.\n\nThis is the fantasy I'm riding for in 2024. This Jamaican-inspired tale takes place after a war for independence and follows two sisters, one chosen to use her connection to the gods to save her country, the other living in her shadow but desperate to make her own mark. Cole will pull you into this fantastical and magical world with dragons and ancestral calling, rooted in beautiful Caribbean traditions, all the while infusing it with colonialism, honor and despair -- a reminder of what happens to a people forced to pick up the pieces of their own liberation.\n\nThere hasn't been a memoir like this in the young adult space that compares to the likes of Audre Lorde's \"The Cancer Journals,\" but Nehanda has changed that with their memoir, a searing look at a cancer patient dealing with medical racism after being diagnosed with leukemia. Nehanda uses both poetry and essays to convey the hospital system as they navigate what feels like a death sentence, all while experiencing the unfortunate aspects of this country's health care system when you're Black, queer, non-binary and have a disability.\n\nI can't stop recommending this book enough, a young adult biography on one of the greatest Black science fiction writers of our time, Octavia Butler. Author and fellow Cancer Ibi Zoboi writes about a young and determined Butler, her dreams, and what she ultimately set out to do, writing works that put a Black girl at the center of any post-apocalyptic world she penned to paper, a world not much different than the one Black girls have to live daily. (The astrology reference is relevant here, by the way: Butler and Zoboi share a birthday.)\n\nAnother story with romance at the center, \"We Deserve Monuments\" offers so much more -- it's equal parts love, grief, family secrets and generational trauma as seen through Avery's eyes as she and her family travel to Georgia to stay with her sick grandmother, aka Mama Letty, for the summer. While Avery is trying to understand the budding feelings she has for her grandmother's next door neighbor Simone, she's also coming to learn the town's hidden racist history and how much of it is connected to her own family. Somehow, while uncovering this racist past, we get to experience Avery and Simone falling in love, despite living in a town where the intersection of Blackness and queerness makes you an even greater target. Through these characters, the author shows us queerness can and should exist everywhere, that this country's past should never be buried, and that sometimes it takes a young person to uncover family truths.\n\nThis book is going to make you feel things -- namely, fear. You might also feel hopeful, considering this horror anthology features Black girls in stories that don't end poorly (for them). You'll see them fighting demons, witches, and generational curses, showing Black girls always know how to save themselves (and this world too). If that isn't enough to persuade you, they got the queen of horror herself, Tananarive Due, to pen the foreword. This book isn't yet available -- it's due out April 2 -- but you can preorder it now to support the multiple Black authors featured in the anthology .\n\nThese days, it seems nearly every single one of us knows a teenager affected by gun violence in some way -- and if we don't, the news serves as a constant reminder of the threat of school shootings that young people face daily. In \"Long Way Down\", Reynolds invites us to reckon with feelings of grief, especially when you're on the brink after losing someone you love dearly. Through verse, he is able to convey the full range of Will's emotions, a seventeen-year-old who has tragically lost his brother to gun violence, and how he finds a way to cope with his new reality.\n\nThis visual (or illustrated) poem is a love letter to the beauty of Black hair, and also documents the history of negative remarks Black and Afro-Latine people have heard over the years about needing to straighten or tame their hair, whether in school, in corporate America or sometimes even at home. While parts of me feel we've come a long way since the CROWN Act was enacted in 2019 -- prohibiting discrimination based on hair style and hair texture -- I'm still gutted every time I read an article of a teenage girl being told her hair was too much of a distraction or a teenage boy being suspended and taken to a disciplinary school because his hair is too long. This book reminds us all that all coils are beautiful and a true mantra for curly kids everywhere.\n\nA graphic novel and biography of American sprinter and Olympic medalist Tommie Smith, this format as a graphic novel is pure gold (pun intended). We follow Tommie's story from the moment his feet leave the blocks, including his backstory of growing up in a Southern family with 13 siblings, and parents who taught and showed him the value of hard work, discipline, consistency, focus and so much more -- values that could be applied in the workforce, in track and in life. Tommie applied these principles while dealing with a muscle injury and death threats, and at the end, we not only see him win the gold medal at the 1968 Summer Olympics for the 200-meter sprint, but proudly and boldly throw his fist in the air to protest the injustice Black people faced in the very country he was running for.\n\nConstantine E. Kanakis, M.D., MSc, MLS, a member of ABC News' medical unit, contributed to this article.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

According to Parham, Twitter was chosen because it was a lightning rod moment. He believes that social tools best spoke to the moment of the 2010s.\n\nParham also said that Twitter had the platform's immediacy and allowed people to come together and connect, which led to so many things happening.\n\nABC News sat down with Parham and Penny to discuss the importance of Black Twitter.\n\nABC NEWS LIVE: Black Twitter was never a URL or an app. Instead, it emerged organically as a thriving community within the Twitter platform itself.\n\nHulu's new three-part docuseries, \"Black Twitter: A People's History,\" directed by Prentice Penny and inspired by Jason Parham's WIRED article series, \"A People's History of Black Twitter,\" traces the evolution of this digital community from its humble beginnings as a hashtag to its impact on everything from entertainment to activism.\n\nThank you so much for joining us tonight, gentlemen.\n\nPENNY: Thank you.\n\nPARHAM: Thanks for having us.\n\nABC NEWS LIVE: So I had a former boss who one time I remember we had done this story that was really blowing up on Black Twitter. And so we were telling him like, 'Oh, my gosh, this is getting so much attention on Black Twitter.' He happened to not be Black. And he was like, 'Do I need a special password?' That was funny. So we'll start out with the general question: How do you find Black Twitter?\n\nPARHAM: I mean, you don't. It's, it's sort of this it's, it's sort of like the not right if you know it. You know what? If you get it, you get it. It's one of those things where it's like, we're not going to explain it to you, but if you're there and you know where to look for it. Yeah, but it's a community of many communities, sort of Black users on the platform, sort of showing up, coming together around moments of joy, courage, sacrifice, sorrow. It's all these things together. Yeah.\n\nABC NEWS LIVE: And, Prentice, congratulations to you on your nonfiction directorial debut. What made you decide you know, 'I'm actually going to do a docuseries about this'?\n\nPENNY: Yeah. I mean, I'd finish \"Insecure\" for HBO and I kind of wanted the feeling of being scared creatively again, and I knew whatever I did next, if it was scripted, would inevitably be compared to that. And I didn't really want that.\n\nAnd so I thought about my favorite filmmaker, Spike Lee, who had done narrative. But it also done docs like, you know, \"When the Levees Break\" and \"Four Little Girls.\" And so I really wanted to pursue that feeling again.  And Condé Nast brought me the article that Jason wrote and, once I read it, I was just like, I'm here for this.\n\nABC NEWS LIVE: And, Jason, what inspired you to write the article?\n\nPARHAM: At the time, and I've been a part of Black Twitter since the beginning, 2009, almost sort of when the origin of it starts for me. And I just kind of wanted to give Black Twitter its flowers while it was still around, you know, so many things on the social editor are here today and gone tomorrow.\n\nSo, I felt like Black Twitter had it had been enough distance from its origin in, its founding where we could like, really put some care and thought and really give it, uh, it's just due.\n\nABC NEWS LIVE: Do you feel like, for either of you, it's not as prominent any longer now that Elon Musk is part of, there's been so many changes, change from Twitter to X. Has that at all changed the community?\n\nPARHAM: I mean, the data shows that, you know, there has been an exodus of users from the platform, less so for Black users. I think they're not on the main avenue in the way that they used to be, like in moments of the Black Lives Matter movement or during Trump's election, but they're still there doing what they're doing, doing what they do in their own corners of the app, for sure.\n\nPENNY: I was going to say I think our culture, in this country, is usually pushed out right in certain ways. And I think our presence on the platform is another way of defiance of being right, just because you own it. We've kind of established a home here, and it may not be a physical home, but it's a digital space again where you feel support, you feel joy. And so I think there is a hesitance to go, like, 'why should we leave?'\n\nABC NEWS LIVE: And why Twitter do you feel, in particular, now known as X? Why do you think that this started? Because there are a lot of other this could have happened on Facebook. It could have happened on Instagram.\n\nPARHAM: It really was a lightning rod moment. I think it was the social tool that best spoke to the moment of the 2010s. We were coming out of the Obama years. We had the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nThere were so many things that I think Twitter, that was sort of the immediacy of the platform and people coming together and to connect. It was the news almost before the news.\n\nPENNY: And we talk about this in the doc, too. I think Twitter was a lot of different things. It wasn't sure what it was trying to be. So, as a result, it was very pliable as a platform; you could use it.\n\nAnd Black culture is typically really good at, in this country, of taking something and repurposing it or remixing it, not in its original intention, but doing what works for us. And I think that's why you see memes and that sort of language take off or activism take off is because we could bend the platform to kind of do whatever we needed it to do.\n\nABC NEWS LIVE: You talk about it as coming of age. How do you think that the future will evolve for Black Twitter? Do you feel like it is growing up and changing the dynamic different?\n\nPENNY: I think it's definitely grown up and stepped into its own power in its own way, and I feel like it's even off the platform now.\n\nI mean, I think you're seeing it obviously in other social media apps. I feel like you're seeing and in real life, I have three kids. They have lived in a life where they have always heard the phrase Black Lives Matter or Black Girl Magic, and that's all a result of of stuff that happened on Black Twitter.\n\nSo I feel like it's just bigger than the platform now. I think it's always been in us, and I think that's, just gave us the tools to take it out into the real world.\n\nABC NEWS LIVE: Prentice, Jason, we thank you both so much for coming on and talking with us. Really appreciate it. Want to let our viewers know \"Black Twitter: A People's History\" is now available to stream on Hulu.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "The GMA Inspiration List: Who's making Black history in 2021?\n\nInfluential Black Americans nominated these these trailblazers.\n\nBlack History Month has become a time-honored tradition since it was first conceptualized as \"Negro History Week\" in 1925 by Carter G. Woodson and the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History (ASNLH), and first celebrated in 1926. In 1976, honoring the heritage of Black Americans became a month-long celebration, officially recognized in the United States by President Gerald R. Ford.\n\nNow more than ever, February is a time to remember the people who have enriched the community with knowledge, pride and respect. We recognize the contributions, struggles and history of African Americans, and reflect on the idea that Black History is at the heart of American history.Welcome to the first GMA INSPIRATION LIST: Who's Making Black History Right Now?\n\nGood Morning America and ABC News asked influential Black leaders, celebrities, intellectuals, entrepreneurs, athletes and more to nominate fellow Black Americans for the list. Most of these nominations are rising stars on the cusp of becoming household names, whose influence, we believe, will become monumental. They are \"hidden figures\" doing the work, gaining success and sharing their talent ... making Black history right here, right now.\n\nAmerica, meet the next generation of Black excellence.\n\nDiscover over 100 nominations from 98 influential figures in the Black American community:\n\nDuring Black History Month it is important to reflect on those who've paved the way and recognize the new generation following in their footsteps. Tomi Adeyemi exemplifies the latter. At 27 years old, she is breaking barriers as a best-selling novelist and creative writing coach. Her debut novel, \"Children of Blood and Bone,\" spent over two years on the New York Times Best Sellers List and is currently being adapted into a film. Tomi uses her words to celebrate the richness of the Black experience and creates leading characters with the intention of inspiring those behind her: \"A little Black girl [could] pick up my book one day and see herself as the star ... I want her to know that she's beautiful and she matters, and she can have a crazy, magical adventure ...\" It's a been a pleasure to witness Tomi's rise. As she continues to put pen to paper, she simultaneously writes her name in Black history.\n\nWATCH: 'GMA' Inspiration List celebrates those making Black history now\n\nDeion Sanders is walking the walk and making Black history now. In his new role as the head football coach at Jackson State, an HBCU, Deion is on a mission to level the playing field for Jackson State and all HBCUs by bringing national attention and recognition to the traditionally underfunded schools. As an HBCU alum, I applaud the work Coach Prime is doing and thank him for giving these student athletes an opportunity they may never have gotten.\n\nLewis Hamilton launched The Hamilton Commission to effect \"real, tangible, and measurable change in motorsports diversity.\" Its goal is to see how motorsport can be used to get more Black children involved in science, technology, engineering and mathematics subjects, and to help them find employment in the future. Lewis is using his platform to help make change now and I salute him for his work in making Black history now.\n\nFollowing the jarring scenes of violence at our nation's Capitol, fashion designer Sergio Hudson gave us an opportunity to focus on Washington, D.C. with pride and excitement. His eye-popping merlot pantsuit ensemble chosen by former first lady Michelle Obama was transformative. He also gave us plenty to dream about as trailblazing Vice President Kamala Harris watched the inaugural fireworks in her sleek black evening attire. 36-year-old Hudson strolled onto the world stage along with these fabulous women. He also charmed us all with his gracious spirit.\n\nSaving our children with her love - fighting for justice for Black Americans when her justice is even more denied. Getting the rest of America to listen, with the weight of her tears, the strength of her voice, and the power of her stare. There's no more important a person in Black history right now than the Black Woman.\n\nWith wisdom that far exceeds her age, poet Amanda Gorman held a mirror before Americans watching the dawn of a new day in this country and spoke to our collective soul - honestly, painfully, beautifully - and showed us, just through her mere presence as a young, diverse, woman of the next generation, why we have reasons to hope.\n\nRaised in the projects of the East Bronx, Ritchie Torres, U.S. Representative from New York's 15th District, is one of only two openly gay Black men elected to Congress and the first openly gay Afro-Latino elected to Congress. He helped to open the first homeless shelter for LGBTQ youth in the Bronx, and has focused on projects aimed at gun violence prevention and reduction. At just age 32, he connects with youth while having a direct line to more senior leaders to help foster discussion and change .\n\nThe first woman to lead the Louisville Urban League in its 95-year history, Sadiqa Reynolds was a key figure in organizing community response in the days and months after Breonna Taylor was killed, and instrumental in fostering constructive dialogue with Louisville city leaders - using her position to call for non-violent protests in Louisville and across the country, and fight for systemic change. All the while, still working for Black equality in jobs, education, health, housing, and the arts.\n\nAlphonso David, president of the Human Rights Campaign , runs the nation's largest LGBTQ advocacy group, fighting for equality and inclusion. The organization has a number of programs, including one focused on and working directly with HBCUs. As we know, with the stigma of being gay, suicide rates and many other problems are far higher in queer communities of color.\n\nTamika Palmer was heartbroken after her daughter, Breonna Taylor, was shot and killed by police in Louisville. Palmer, who describes herself as an extremely private person, ditched her shyness to step into the spotlight, and fight for police reform and be a voice for Black women. Using her social media and partnering with other groups, Palmer has vowed to work to bring about real change and reform to law enforcement.\n\nBlack women have been the backbone of our society for centuries. They've raised their own families. They've raised others. They've fed communities. They've fed our souls. Black women have taken on an array of jobs in the course of our nation: homemaker, abolitionist, scientist, doctor, lawyer, entertainer, journalist, politician, first lady, and now: vice president. Black women have been the pillars behind change. Black women have led movements. So it was no surprise when Dr. Kizzmekia \"Kizzy\" Corbett stepped up to help save the world by leading the team that developed a coronavirus vaccine. COVID-19 has been disproportionately affecting Black people killing them at a higher rate. But when a November Axios/Ipsos poll showed only 55% of Black Americans said they would take a vaccine, Dr. Anthony Fauci pointed to Dr. Corbett to raise the level of confidence. \"So, the first thing you might want to say to my African American brothers and sisters is that the vaccine that you're going to be taking was developed by an African American woman,\" Fauci said. One of the National Institutes of Health's leading scientists, Dr. Corbett was always top of the pack. As a student, the North Carolina native was part of a program for gifted minority students, which allowed her to study chemistry in labs at UNC-Chapel Hill. She received a full ride to the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. Dr. Corbett spent summers inside labs and a summer internship at NIH before getting her Ph.D. in microbiology and immunology from UNC-Chapel Hill. She told ABC News that she could have never anticipated what she's been able to accomplish. We salute this rising star in the study of infectious diseases and Dr. Corbett's commitment to ending this deadly pandemic.\n\nThe name that immediately comes to mind is Jerry Lorenzo, the designer behind the high-end fashion line Fear of God. In the last few years he's had a couple of major breakthroughs. First, an incredibly successful collab with Nike doing something the shoe giant seldom does - give complete control of a silhouette to an outsider. Aside from that, Lorenzo, who attended Florida A &M, has been consistent in nods to Black culture in his designs. That includes a line last year honoring the 100-year anniversary of the Negro Leagues. And next, Lorenzo and Adidas have announced a partnership that will see the designer head up the Three Stripes' basketball division, as well as the formation of Fear of God Athletics. He says he wants a Ralph Lauren-esque legacy and he's well on his way. His star and influence is only going to continue to rise.\n\nI nominate Aisha \"Pinky\" Cole, the owner of Slutty Vegan, as someone who is not only living the American dream and inspiring others along the way, but also making Black history against all odds as a minority small business owner. While restaurants are folding in this COVID-ravaged economy, Cole has found a way to thrive while selling plant-based comfort food wrapped in the Black cultural experience. She uses celebrity power and her nonprofit to promote social justice causes, educate and encourage communities of color to vote, help other small businesses that are struggling, giving out free meals to community members in need, helping students pay off college loans and being part of many other philanthropic initiatives.\n\nAs a motorsports enthusiast, I think Formula 1 (F1) champion Lewis Hamilton is making Black history before our eyes. His tenacity on the track is arguably unmatched. Beyond his accomplishments on the racing circuit, Hamilton has amplified the conversation about diversity and racial equality across the globe.\n\nL. Londell McMillan is not only the owner of the NorthStar Group and The Source magazine, he amplifies community voices, promotes kindness in hip-hop and advocates for business ownership among entrepreneurs of color.\n\nDr. Freeman Hrabowski , the president of University of Maryland, Baltimore County, has graduated more Black students in the STEM fields than any other university in the nation.\n\nDr. Valerie Montgomery Rice , the dean of Morehouse School of Medicine, is almost single-handedly growing the number of Black medical doctors.\n\nMellody Hobson, the co-CEO of Ariel Investments, which is the oldest Black investment firm in the United States. She spends coin and time growing Black financial literacy at Ariel Community Academy, a public school in a Chicago.\n\nSeni Tienabeso , Catherine McKenzie , and Janice Johnston , who are all executive producers at the ABC News network level at the same time - a first, and a step forward for people of color having the opportunity to decide what's important day to day in news and the message.\n\nOne of the unsung heroes behind the historic turnout that helped propel Democrats to victory in Georgia is LaTosha Brown , who together with Cliff Albright, founded Black Voters Matter in 2016.\n\nI am thinking of Cavanaugh Bell , a youngster who was bullied who has transformed his pain into love and empathy by spearheading a food pantry to help others in need during the pandemic.\n\nLinda Lopes, a yoga teacher and reiki practitioner, is a gifted healer creating access to a diverse community of students in Brooklyn, New York and beyond. She's shaping Black history with the powers of grace and intention.\n\nIt's been said that joy is the strongest form of resistance. Against the backdrop of systemic oppression and social uprising, Saada Ahmed, the co-founder of Everyday People , and her team (Chef Roblé and DJ Moma) are known the world over. Everyday People is a celebration of who we are. It's the embodiment of love, respect and resistance. Their platform now includes invaluable outreach, conversations and context for today's most relevant issues. They are shaping Black history by building community and creating space for Black people to be seen as their full selves.\n\nHer books are number one. Her headbands are sold out. And we are all collectively waiting for her next move. While poet Amanda Gorman stole the show on Inauguration Day as she recited \"The Hill We Climb,\" it's really the highest peak of the mountaintop that she is now ascending. Amanda was introduced to the world as a 22-year-old poet, but it was more than her poetry that captivated the world. It was her power, her prowess, her passion... now propelling her to the highest heights. She has been called \"a new kind of style icon.\" But more than a model, she is a role model. At 22 she made history as the youngest inaugural poet, but we will all be watching as she makes history again... in whatever form that may take. Clearly we haven't heard nor seen the last from Amanda .\n\nDr. Kizzmekia \"Kizzy\" Corbett found herself on the frontlines at a time when her community and nation needed her most. The young doctor played a pivotal role in developing a vaccine to stop a virus that is disproportionately killing Black Americans. Representation matters especially for a community where centuries of racism has led to medical mistrust and in a field where Black scientists are still underrepresented.\n\nBrooklyn designer Aurora James started the 15 Percent Pledge after the George Floyd protests to get big corporations to support Black-owned businesses. Her petition went viral and she got companies like Sephora to make shelf space for underrepresented brands.\n\nTamika Mallory , a prominent social justice advocate, whose speech during the summer protests was dubbed the speech of a generation because she eloquently captured what many Black Americans were feeling.\n\nLindsay Peoples Wagner , editor-in-chief of Teen Vogue and also co-founder of the Black Fashion Council, a group formed to advocate for inclusivity and equality in the fashion industry.\n\nAs a career-changer like me, Tracee Stanley has found her true calling. She embraces yoga not only as a practice, but a way of life. In fact, Tracee says that yoga found her. I deeply admire her, because she lives her life promoting healing while creating a space for relaxation and a greater connection to self. She is very deliberate and intentional with her practice and how she delivers it to the world at large. While Tracee may be known in the yoga community, her work is vital to the physical and mental health of the Black community and communities of color. Tracee has drawn upon her 20-plus years of experience and practice to guide and train others to spread this much needed healing. This is invaluable, because mental and emotional health is not a topic that is discussed freely. She is healing these communities by drawing upon tantric practices and teachings to help people address trauma. With mental illness on the rise, the healing power that Tracee provides is needed even more and to a broader audience. She's the author of \"Radiant Rest,\" to be released in March 2021, and the creator and host of a podcast of the same name.\n\nAmanda Gorman is a young Black girl doing phenomenal things. She's a prime example of how age shouldn't hinder your accomplishments. I had the privilege of speaking with her in December 2020 and it's clear that great things lie ahead. She was the youngest inaugural poet. She's written for the New York Times. She's reciting a poem at the Super Bowl. She has spent years speaking out about the social injustices we face in this country and her poetry has resonated in the hearts of many.\n\nLauren Ridloff is bringing awareness and visibility to what it means to be a Black deaf woman living in the world. By taking on roles in mainstream projects like \"The Walking Dead\" and \"The Eternals\" - where she will play Marvel's first deaf superhero - she is showing the hearing world that Black deaf folks exist while also inspiring future generations of young kids to see that they can pursue a career in entertainment as well.\n\nAdam Faison stars in \"Everything's Gonna Be Okay\" on Freeform.\n\nI am completely in awe of and inspired by Stacey Abrams. Her dedication to the progressive movement of civil rights and tireless leadership of our communities has not only been impactful for Georgians, but for our county as a whole. Ms. Abrams has fought for and encouraged the (otherwise) unheard voices of our state to be acknowledged and respected by our democracy. I'm grateful that she represents a tangible figure, for young black girls and future generations, to understand their importance and value. Stacey Abrams is the embodiment of Black Girl Magic.\n\nKron Moore stars as First Lady Victoria Franklin in the BET prime time soap opera \"The Oval.\"\n\nStacey Abrams, who served in the Georgia House of Representatives, lost a Georgia gubernatorial race in 2018 which was alleged to have been rife with voter suppression. Instead of letting that loss be the end of it and focusing on making her next political move, Stacey focused on fixing the problem at the root. She aimed to galvanize voters in the most marginalized and suppressed communities. She started Fair Fight, an organization created to register and empower voters in numerous battleground states. Along with the help of so many who recognized how important this fight was, Stacey helped turn Georgia blue for Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election, a feat not seen since Bill Clinton won the state in 1992. She is now nominated for Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nShe is the epitome of Black girl magic to me. Never letting your losses be the end of your journey. She's a fighter and always aims to work for the greater good. An icon in the truest sense.\n\nAmong many, Issa Rae is exemplifying Black history in excellence. Her storytelling normalizes (and shines an incredibly nuanced, honest and cathartic light on) the many experiences of our community and refuses to settle for stereotypes or perfectionism. She does all of this while providing career advancement for so many people. Her impact and purpose are generational and have undoubtedly opened doors for me to be the authentic creator I am today.\n\nZuri Adele stars in \"Good Trouble\" on Freeform.\n\nI am totally inspired by Vice President Kamala Harris . There are so many reasons that she inspires me. Because her initials are K. Harris and my mother's name is Kimberly Harris (so she, too, is K. Harris) is the beginning of me being totally attached to her. They are both boss chicks and doing big things in the world to make a difference. Another reason is that both K. Harris boss chicks belong to the same sorority that I am legacy to - Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. - the pink and green. But I don't even have to say that Vice President K. Harris is changing the world. She is not just going to make a difference in our country but the entire world! Little girls that look like me will forever be able to say, because she was the first, we can be the next. It was so, so exciting to watch all of the ceremonies on Jan. 20, 2021. I almost could not stop yelling and screaming. It made my heart feel fuzzy inside. When she walked with her niece who had afro puffs like me, it was almost unbelievable to see on the way to the White House! I mean, can you believe it? I am watching Black history being made. Wow. Thank you, Vice President Harris. We love you more than you know.\n\nRecent Harvard grad Amanda Gorman made history on Jan 20, 2021. Ms. Gorman's story resonates with me because she's shared that she has battled a speech impediment and we know that President Biden was able to overcome a severe stutter as a child. My own immigrant mother, who has a pronounced stutter, through intense work and determination became a singer, performing on a world stage during her career. Amanda Gorman had a national stage and she acknowledged her power , \"... in a country and a time where a skinny Black girl descended from slaves and raised by a single mother can dream of becoming president, only to find herself reciting for one.\"\n\nWithout question, Madam Vice President Kamala Harris. She has made history throughout her career being the first Black woman in her positions. First, as an attorney general in California and now as the vice president. Her strong core values will ensure a path of many more firsts. And as VP , she will undoubtedly be making great progress in the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nLogan Browning has found a beautiful way to unapologetically capture the essence of change by amplifying her voice for diversity and equity. As well as cultivate a soulful and mindful space that transcends beyond the boundaries of time, race, gender and spirit. She is an amazing representation for Black Womxn in this generation and is already creating a legendary journey for herself.\n\nWhen thinking about people who are making Black history today, film director, producer, and screenwriter Ryan Coogler is a leader in this new generation. He tells stories that focus on current issues and achieving social change, like \"Fruitvale Station,\" and mentors new voices on projects like \"Judas and the Black Messiah.\" America knows his work best through \"Black Panther,\" which started a movement that instilled the Black community and people of color with a sense of empowerment, pride, and identity about our culture and place in history, while also including the whole of society. However, the history he's making isn't just artistic. Through Blackout for Human Rights and its movements like #BlackoutFriday, he's using his voice and the power of community to make a real impact on the nation. I'm inspired by his voice , his spirit and am excited to see how he continues to make Black history.\n\nIt is with great pleasure that I nominate Tamika D. Mallory to GMA's Inspiration List for Black History Month.\n\nFor those of you who don't know, Tamika has been in the game for a long time. Her parents were founding members of Rev. Al's National Action Network, where Tamika volunteered as a teenager, eventually becoming its youngest Executive Director in 2011. In 2017, Tamika mobilized the Women's March, protesting the inauguration of Donald Trump. And in 2019, she was the co-president of the Women's March. And that brings us to 2020. Over the summer, I was mesmerized by Tamika's courageous work on the frontlines fighting for racial justice in the wake of the George Floyd murder. Seeing this young, black woman stand in her power, protesting against inequality - it was inspiring. Amongst all the chaos, here was this beacon of hope. Tamika is a force to be reckoned with, a true game changer, who will not stop until she leaves her footprint not just on America, but on the world. Tamika lives and breathes activism. It's in her blood. Following in the footsteps of the civil rights activists who came before, Tamika dares to use her voice. Speaking truth to power - when the weaker man opts to remain silent. As with the crusaders of that era, history will not recognize the impact of Tamika's work for years to come. But believe you me, Tamika D. Mallory is making Black History right now. But don't take my word for it, check her out for yourself. Her inspiration awaits you.\n\nGeorge Mumford's performance, expertise and mindfulness training have been quietly making history behind the scenes. George has been the sports psychologist for elite athletes like Michael Jordan and Kobe Bryant, and has been called \"Phil Jackson's secret weapon\" to winning eight NBA championships. But Mumford's contribution to helping people achieve greatness isn't limited to high-profile athletes. He uses his skills to help female athletes push beyond the limits sexism poses in sports. He's guiding students at Historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) through challenging situations around racism and has even brought the art of mindfulness to people incarcerated. According to George, \"Success is being and expressing yourself and hopefully in the service of helping others.\" George believes we all have a divine spark in us, and if we're willing to chip away and reveal that, it will make the world better for all of us. George is sharing the secrets to performance expertise with our communities, who have not historically had access to these practices. These have been very white, elite spaces - often open to top earners and high performers. George is working to change that.\n\nMi madre, Demour D'Angelo, because she is amazing by being a strong, beautiful Black woman (aka \"The Backbone\") in her family, job and community in the American South.\n\n\"You can't grow up and be Black in America and not experience trauma from these systems that were built to traumatize us.\" A quote by Kendrick Sampson. Kendrick was one of the first people that I met back in L.A. in 2008. We lived in the same apartment complex and shared a few of the same team members. The thing that sat with me most upon meeting him and that has only grown in spades since is his genuine care for humanity. Beyond being the incredible actor he is, showing art and soul in all performances, he leads his life with incredible fortitude, standing up for and speaking out on the things that mean the most to him, from the Black Lives Matter movement to true mental health care and awareness, specifically for the Black community. From one mixed man from the South to another, thank you, Kendrick.\n\nJessica Moneà Evans is a multifaceted artist from Raleigh, North Carolina, who connects the past and present through dance. Under the guidance of her legendary mentor, Tanita Fadyeyola, the founder and creator of the movement modality Afrofunk Dance Fitness (a fusion of movements from around the world that inspires positive transformation and growth), Jessica learned to translate deep ancestral and spiritual roots into movement manifestations with choreography, storytelling and positive affirmations. Jessica's presence as a Black, female choreographer, who authentically showcases African dance in a largely co-opted space, is immeasurable and she is able to produce works of art for both theater and film that are visually stunning and emotionally powerful.\n\nKirby Howell-Baptiste is an actress who has appeared in \"Killing Eve,\" \"The Good Place,\" \"Barry,\" \"Why Women Kill\" and more. She will star opposite Emma Stone in Disney's live-action \"Cruella,\" to be released in 2021.\n\nI want to name two people making Black history right now. The first is my uncle, Dr. Pastor Marshall Hatch of New Mount Pilgrim Missionary Baptist Church on the Westside Of Chicago. Outside of being a huge role model to me, he fights every day for African Americans not only in our community but all over the city of Chicago. He use his strong faith, education and morals to do what's right, and is well respected in our community and political landscapes.\n\nThe second is DeShuna Spencer, founder and CEO of the streaming service kweliTV. She created a platform for Black content creators all over the world to have a home to tell their stories, and also found a way that they can get paid for their amazing content, which include feature films, documentaries, short films, web series, animation series and more.\n\nNigel Campbell and Chanel DaSilva founded MOVE |NYC| in 2015, a leading-edge arts and social justice nonprofit organization with an ambitious mission to cultivate greater diversity and equity within the dance profession and beyond. Chanel and Nigel first conceptualized MOVE |NYC| in 2013 as the Black Lives Matter movement was gaining momentum and while reflecting on why they saw so few dancers of color in the profession. They peeled back the layers and found that what hinders young dancers from realizing their full potential, particularly young dancers of color, is not their level of talent, but their lack of access to individualized guidance and support due to historical socioeconomic barriers. Chanel and Nigel tackle these pervasive and inequitable roadblocks by providing tuition-free artistic training, mentorship and professional development resources to young artists at the earliest stages of their careers. These promising young artists are destined to not only enter the dance profession, but lead it. With a proven track record of high school students gaining acceptance into the most prestigious conservatories and colleges in the nation, such as The Juilliard School, Chanel and Nigel's critical work has garnered national recognition. Recently, they were featured on the cover of Dance Teacher magazine's Spring 2020 issue titled, \"Changing the Face of Dance,\" rendering the work of Chanel, Nigel and MOVE|NYC| as essential to the dance ecosystem. Furthering their impact as Black leaders and visionaries in the field, Nigel co-directs the Gibney Company in New York City, and teaches dance and entrepreneurial courses at colleges and conservatories across the nation, while Chanel has an active freelance choreography practice with credits including a 2019 IRNE nomination for best choreography for \"The Black Clown,\" which premiered at American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nTeyonah Parris is an actress who plays the role of \"Monica Rambeau\" in Disney+'s \"Wandavision\" and will also be seen in \"Candyman\" in Spring 2021. Teyonah's work also includes roles on \"Mad Men,\" \"Dear White People\" and \"If Beale Street Could Talk.\"\n\nUpon hearing the brief, the legendary Pierre Davis immediately came to mind as the perfect nominee. I'm not sure if the word \"unsung\" works here - dressing a myriad of celebrities and people of note, debuting as the first trans woman of color to present during New York Fashion Week and establishing her unique aesthetic voice are just a few highlights during her time in the international fashion consciousness. Her work is helping to shift the fashion conversation towards a more idiosyncratic and personal way of dressing - anointing style and craft over trends. I'm continually inspired by the modernity and community-based nature of her offering. Her specific understanding of texture, nuanced attention to detail and fit, and her ability to make people feel something with her designs resonate with me. She's an icon , she's a legend and she is the moment.\n\nMy choice would be Karen Attiah, global opinions editor and columnist for the Washington Post. She is only in her 30s, but she has already made a big impact on the journalism world in her time at the Washington Post. Whether she is speaking truth to power in the name of racial justice in her columns or ensuring that Black perspectives from around the world are heard, her work is a clear commitment to elevating Black voices from Africa, Europe and the Americas. As an editor, she might be known best for drawing international attention to the cause of accountability for Jamal Khashoggi, the Washington Post columnist that was killed by Saudi regime agents in 2018. But she has also been writing hard-hitting articles that force America to confront its own injustices, including pieces like \"America hates to let Black women speak,\" on powerful Black women like Kamala Harris being interrupted; \"The Texas Rangers' team name must go,\" an argument for why the Texas Rangers baseball team's name carries a racist legacy; and of course, her viral columns on \"How Western media would cover ...\" satirical series, which forces readers to confront America's own myths of being an exceptional country. Whether she is writing about Megan Thee Stallion, Breonna Taylor or Kamala Harris, she makes sure that issues affecting Black women are represented at the Washington Post. For her work, she has won the prestigious George Polk Award and National Association of Black Journalists 2019 Journalist of the Year award. She doesn't do any of this without risk, as she puts her safety and security on the line for speaking out against injustice. Nevertheless, she continues to speak truth to power without fear, inspiring us all.\n\nMy mom, Dr. Sybil Smith, Ed.D, is a Black American modern history-maker and my hero. She is the first African-American female swimmer to be named as a first-team Division I All-American and is still the only All-American in Boston University women's swimming history. My mom broke barriers in the swimming world and instilled that determined spirit in me as I pursued my own athletic career in another sport with historic underrepresentation of people of color. You'll notice I referred to her by her full title - I think it is so important for Black women to embrace our hard work and show up as our fullest, most authentic selves. My mom is a school psychologist by training and earned her doctorate degree during late nights on the road with me as I worked toward my dreams. As the executive director of the Sloane Stephens Foundation, she leads our tennis, education and mental wellness programs in 25 K-12 schools in the Compton Unified School District, one of the most historically underserved communities in the country. In six years, we've served over 6,000 Compton students and are working to create pathways to generational change - encouraging Black and Latinx students to graduate high school, be leaders, make healthy choices and dream big. One hundred percent of students in our program have graduated high school and gone on to a two or four-year institution. My mom practices what she preaches and leads by example. She cares for each student as if they were her own, and has worked tirelessly to ensure their physical and emotional wellness, spending time working with district administrators, sponsors, community members and parents to provide opportunities for every single student that crosses her path. Dr. Sybil Smith, Ed.D. is a community builder, role model, advocate and champion. I am beyond proud to call her my mom and to share her light with the world.\n\nSloane Stephens is a US Open Champion and a top player on the WTA Tour with five WTA titles. In short: she's amazing.\n\nPorter Braswell and Ryan Williams will be making history for many years to come. What I most admire about this duo is that they uncovered a problem and found a solution. Their intelligence, passion and innovative abilities led to the founding of Jopwell . While working on Wall Street, they were frequently called upon to recruit other minority candidates. They knew there had to be a better way to attract top talent at scale while building a diverse professional community. In 2014 they left finance to launch Jopwell, which helps companies connect with, recruit, and retain students and professionals of color. Jopwell currently assists over 300 companies in their diversity, equity and inclusion strategies, and their platform has helped tens of thousands of its community members connect with corporate opportunities. A resource for both top companies and minority talent across the country, Ryan and Porter are eliminating excuses about diversity hires in corporations and providing opportunities for the next generation of talented innovators.\n\nArtistic Director Kyle Abraham's voice, vision and choreography are the future of dance. In founding his own company, A.I.M., Kyle has long been creating works that tell stories of identity, history and community, earning him recognition as a MacArthur \"Genius\" Fellow. His expansion from creating pieces for the modern dance community to also including the classical ballet world, his work and artistry couldn't be more timely and important. With the state and climate of the world today, Kyle's presence as a Black creator in the very white ballet space has pushed boundaries, and is leading the way in an art form that doesn't often represent Black people or tell our stories.\n\nLeyna Bloom is an actress, model, dancer and activist. In 2017, she made headlines for being one of the few openly transgender models to walk the runway during New York Fashion Week and became the first transgender woman of color to appear in Vogue India. In 2019, Leyna was the only transgender model to walk the runway at Paris Fashion Week for Tommy Hilfiger x Zendaya's Fall/Winter collection. Leyna recently made her acting debut in Danielle Lessovitz's \"Port Authority,\" which premiered at the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. It was the first film in festival history to feature a transgender woman of color in a leading role. This year, Leyna can be seen in advertising campaigns for Levi's, Dior and Tresemme. Leyna is a formidable force who is breaking down barriers in the industry. She is a true inspiration for her activism in the Black transgender community. She is creating real change and inspiring LGBTQ youth to be proud of who they are. Leyna is blazing a trail and it's exciting to watch.\n\nMargaret \"Midge\" Purce is an American soccer player in the National Women's Soccer League who recently received call-ups to the U.S. Women's National Team and made her first appearance for the USA at the end of last year. She has inspired me in many ways, as a friend, teammate, mentor and role model, and her passion to elevate the image and representation of Black women as athletes and leaders across all industries has made her a trailblazer and a powerful advocate. She is the executive director of the Black Women's Player Collective, a nonprofit organization that aims to advance opportunities for Black girls in sports and beyond. As a Harvard graduate, one of the best players to come out of the Ivy League in recent memory and a prominent member of the Harvard Board of Overseers, she continues to exhibit her exceptional leadership qualities by empowering others, like myself, to join in the fight for direct access to soccer for underrepresented minorities.\n\nThe impact of LaJean Gould's commitment to fostering the growth of golf among women and youth is undeniable. For decades the Women in Golf Foundation has helped develop young golfers by increasing opportunities for them to learn and compete into adulthood, and instilling leadership and life skills applicable to all facets of life. With youth programs based in predominantly minority neighborhoods in the Metro Atlanta area and the Women's Collegiate Championship that provides a competitive opportunity for HBCU women's golf programs, her influence on the accessibility of golf in the Black community is especially noteworthy. Equally significant is that every college golfer groomed within WIGF went on to earn their degree. At a time when the world is reckoning with the work that must be done to achieve true equality, LaJean's bottom-up approach, beginning with the youth, can be used as a blueprint for golf organizations everywhere.\n\nMy rival. My teammate. My friend. Reshanda Gray is a beam of light in every space she enters. I've never felt such love and gratitude from a person in my time in the WNBA. Last season, the 2020 bubble, was a first and a frenzy. In the middle of working hard to ensure a safe season, also dedicated to raising awareness for social justice, every team had to do their best to put together a group of women ready to compete in such unexpected circumstances. Hours before the deadline for finalized rosters, the L.A. Sparks signed former Cal Bear, Reshanda Gray. Her alma mater only matters in this case because I competed against \"Gray-Gray\" as a player at Stanford, Cal's rival (Go Card!). And, as dreamers do, we followed individual paths to play professionally. And as life would have it, this Texas native turned honorary Californian, and a young woman born, raised, and bred in the soul of Los Angeles stepped onto the hardwood as teammates on the L.A. Sparks for a special season that would eventually reveal a friendship forever. Without going on endlessly about Reshanda as a person, the intention and impact of her work speaks loudly and for itself. In 2015, the year she was drafted, the No Gray Areas foundation was formed. Even before establishing herself in a new and competitive career as a high-level professional athlete, Reshanda already had others needs in mind before her own. No Gray Areas' mission is and continues to be to provide support, love and opportunity to undecided women academically, socially and athletically through education, mentorship and fitness with the State of California. And a season confined to a bubble didn't stop that! In my time as her teammate, I learned much about Reshanda, her community, and what she is doing and wishes to continue to do to make things better. As a girl from South Central L.A., her heart throbs for the impact she has in her own neighborhood as someone with resources to make a change for young aspirers in marginalized communities. From initiatives and camps, to community drives and workshops, Reshanda is making great change and leads by example by showing that love, care and support for our people and society that need it most come from giving back, giving first and never giving up.\n\nNneka Ogwumike is President of the WNBA Players' Association and WNBA MVP.\n\nRyan Tillman is a continued source of inspiration to me and a perfect example of someone who has turned adversity into strength for the greater good. Currently, Ryan is a Police Officer for the Chino Police Department, however, prior to Ryan's career as a Police Officer, he was not a fan of Law Enforcement due to negative interactions with them as he was growing up. Upon completing the Field Training Program, Ryan recognized the need for more transparency and dialogue between Law Enforcement and the community, so he created Breaking Barriers United LLC (BBU). With an understanding that the future lies in the hands of our youth, Breaking Barriers United is an initiative which addresses current issues between law enforcement and the communities they serve, with a transparent approach. Through relationship building and mentoring programs, BBU connects with tomorrow's leaders in neighborhoods sometimes forgotten. Since its inception, Ryan has changed the perception of many citizens, as well as Police Officers, throughout the world. Ryan speaks on a national level for both Law Enforcement and non-LE organizations. He has created afterschool programs that train and teach students about the profession of Law Enforcement and Career Development. He also has a podcast called \"ITSNEEDED\" which brings law enforcement and city officials together for common goals and is currently developing a program called \"The United\" which aims at recruiting and training the best future police officers.\n\nLewis Hamilton is someone that I've gotten to know over the last year, but before getting to know him, he was someone I looked up to for what he did on and off the track. To have the career that he has had and to win seven championships is simply amazing. But take away the championships and it's the work he does off the track that makes him a great human. The way he uses his platform and voice to push for change around the world to make it a better place for everyone, no matter the color of their skin, is truly inspiring.\n\nStacey Abrams worked to register hundreds of thousands of new voters in Georgia and has dedicated a large part of her career to fighting voter suppression all over the country. I believe her work strongly impacted the presidential election and in flipping the Senate. She truly doesn't get enough credit for all the work she has done and is one of the modern unsung activists. Not only does Abrams fight against voter suppression, she also has founded organizations that ensure young people of color are being hired and continues to develop programs that ensure equity particularly in the South. Without her, it's very possible that our government would look a lot different right now.\n\nAs a kid, I remember my father always reinforcing the importance of Black ownership. This was not just a lesson that he preached to his six kids, but it was one that he lived by example. My father started out his entrepreneurship by carving out a niche for Black managers in an industry that was predominantly occupied by white men by representing two Hall of Fame basketball players (George Gervin and Lynette Woodard). From there, he ventured into the sports apparel industry, where he was the first and only Black-owned company licensed by the NBA and NFL. While he was offered many times, my father refused to ever give up majority ownership of his company, knowing the real value and meaning of owning something for yourself. This is why I would like to nominate my father, Torrel Harris Sr. - not only for his own achievements as a Black entrepreneur, but for his lifelong support, mentorship and empowerment to young Black athletes as well as Black fathers. My father, along with my mother, raised six kids and he created a path to make sure all six kids had the opportunity to attend college (five of us through athletic scholarships). While my father constantly pushed for us to realize our full potential, he also extended that reach and influence to other kids in the community. He started his own AAU teams so that he could take what he learned to support and inform other Black parents how to navigate the - often complex - path to college athletics and scholarships. My father continues his work today as a Black owner of his own sports agency where he manages not only myself and my siblings but other key figures in the sports world. He has successfully galvanized a space where other father-athlete dynamics have joined his agency, and where he has been able to continue empowering and creating meaningful roles for Black athletes and their fathers. In a time when the world is beginning to understand some of the very real, impenetrable and systemic barriers that have prevented Black people (and in this case, Black men) from being in positions of leadership or ownership, I wanted to recognize the lifelong work my father has done to break through those ceilings and the historical footprints he has left for so many others to follow for years to come.\n\nMarley Dias can be an inspiration to us all. As she said so well \"frustration can be fuel,\" and it goes to show how one can use a negative experience to enact positive change. I first read about her a few years ago when she founded the #1000BlackGirlBooks campaign that gathered books featuring Black females as the main characters. Since then, watching that campaign grow (it's over 12,000 books collected now) and also watching how she continued to utilize her platform, whether it be through speaking out at her local BLM protests last summer or hosting her own Netflix series called \"Bookmarks,\" she is truly inspiring. From a young age, she understood the importance of representation in every medium of life, which is something I believe in whole heartedly. I always say that I am unapologetically me and I want Black girls everywhere to be unapologetically themselves. Marley embodies that message and with young Black women like her leading our next generation, I'm excited to watch the endless growth and possibilities for them.\n\nDr. Phillip Atiba Goff is a national leader in the science of racial bias by pioneering scientific experiments that exposed how our minds learn to associate Blackness and crime implicitly - often with deadly consequences. His research led him to co-found the Center for Policing Equity (CPE) , the world's largest research and action think tank on race and policing. The center advocates for large-scale and meaningful change by using advanced analytics to diagnose disparities in policing, shed light on police behavior, and answer questions police and communities have asked for years about how to build a healthy relationship.\n\nMaisha T. Winn is the Chancellor's Leadership Professor, and the co-founder and co-director of the Transformative Justice in Education Center (TJE) in the School of Education at the University of California, Davis. Professor Winn's research examines the ways teachers and adult allies for youth practice \"justice\" in the teaching of literacy. I admire Dr. Winn because of her dedication to Black American students who are systematically locked out of opportunities in which they can thrive and not just survive. Dr. Winn's accomplishments deserve a space in American history books because of the nuanced ways she positions the multiple literacies that Black Americans have gained because of the obstacles we constantly transcend. As a Black woman who holds a Ph.D., Maisha is dedicated to reimagining what leadership looks like and what counts as literacy when we think about the greater context of what Black Americans have endured and overcome across the United States.\n\nWith a name like Passion, what comes to mind? Dr. Passion Moss-Hasan is the principal of the Dionne Warwick Institute , and represents exactly what her name implies when it comes to the complete care and education given to the children attending the school. Her credentials speak for themselves, however, and moreover, she served as principal of the Cicely L. Tyson Community School of Performing & Fine Arts in East Orange, New Jersey, from 2009 to early 2020, as well as the Cicely L. Tyson Community Center. It goes without saying how lucky I feel to have her now at my school. Dr. Moss-Hasan's study of other educational systems has given her a broad spectrum of how these systems have been exceptional successes in educating children as well as adults. By using the theories and practice of these perspectives, she has brought new thought as to how educating can be utilized. To me, there's no other who deserves recognition and to be honored during this Black history celebration.\n\nI love the boldness Bri Steves brings as rising star. She's an outside-the-box-type of artist. Her message reminds me of myself at the early stages of my career, where people tried to box me into one category over another. Is she a rapper, a singer, a producer, a songwriter or a dancer? What is she? Well, I was all of them because I'm an artist. And now we see Bri Steves perfectly blending her different styles in her own dope way. That's exciting to see in music, especially for a female artist. Her new track and video, \"Anti Queen,\" has a great message that really touched my heart. \"They say I'm not a queen / Because I walk like that / And I talk like this / And I don't hold back.\" I was humbled when I watched her pay homage to myself and the other beautiful Black female artists - Aaliyah, Left Eye, Lauryn Hill and Erykah Badu - all who have been culture disruptors. There have always been double standards for women in music when it comes to how we're supposed to look, dress, sound, walk, talk, etc. I've dealt with not fitting the so-called \"mold\" my entire career and that's what's made me, me. And now I see an artist like Bri Steves being true to herself as well. As Bri says in the song, \"It's all bull****!\" Bet on yourself, Bri. No matter what they say, Bri Steves is a queen and \"there's more than one way to wear a crown.\"\n\nI would like to nominate my best friend, Berry Gordy, the man who started Motown, the greatest musical movement in modern day history. As with Motown, Berry remains as important today as he was in the early days of the music company.\n\nLedisi is a great songwriter, a phenomenal singer and performer, and a very talented actress. Plus, she's a really sweet, down to earth and cool person on top of all of this talent. And she reminds me of myself when I was younger! The best is yet to come for Ledisi and I'm looking forward to the two of us working together this year!\n\nI nominate H.E.R. because I feel like she is a young pioneer that has mastered the craft of music that feels good to the soul. She really represents R &B in a beautiful way. And I think that for someone to win the kind of awards that she's won, and to make such an impact that she's had on this industry, and to do it with a mixtape when she hasn't even released a debut album yet, that is pretty impressive. She's super talented, can play so many instruments and she can sing her you-know-what off, and I'm just so proud of her. I believe the reason why H.E.R. is making Black history is because she is a beautiful, Black young lady, and she is showing Black young women and Black women and Black people everywhere - and people everywhere - that if you put your mind to what you do, you have passion and you believe in what you love, you can accomplish so much and you can inspire so many people all around the world.\n\nWATCH: Brandy nominates H.E.R. for The GMA Inspiration List for Black History Month\n\nI have been singing the praises of Kenny J. Seymour, a superstar of musical talent, for years. He's currently musical director of the Tony Award-winning, Broadway musical , \"Ain't Too Proud: The Life and Times of the Temptations,\" which has a predominately Black cast and is based on my life experiences. Kenny's keen vision tells the story of our Grammy-winning music and his dynamic, stylistic influences are authentic to the original compositions, and to the Black culture from which the Temptations' music was originally created and produced in Detroit. A creative genius and trailblazer, Kenny's dedication to creating and supporting diversity in the performing arts worldwide, fused with his determination to nurture the next generation of talent among Black artists and beyond, exemplifies his inherent spirit of inspiration and collaboration notable throughout his distinguished, award-winning career.\n\nMrs. Emma Schell Dudley, affectionately known to me and so many others as \"Aunt Emma,\" has been a continuous source of motivation and strength for most of my life. I admire her desire to give children stability and love as well as lending her knowledge as a mathematician by tutoring them free for over 50 years. Aunt Emma dedicated her life to Christ, family and community long ago, and in her wise age she still continues to be a beacon of hope and love for all of us. Aunt Emma is the epitome of strength and one we all can look up to.\n\nWren Troy Brown is an actor, producer and director in the city of Los Angeles. His impressive film and television credits include \"The Orville,\" \"Transparent,\" \"Grey's Anatomy,\" \"Waiting to Exhale,\" among many others. Wren is the founder and producing artistic director of the award-winning Ebony Repertory Theatre. Ebony Rep holds the distinction of being Los Angeles' first and only African-American professional theater company, and it is where I first met Wren over a decade ago. I was invited to be a part of a concert presentation on the stage, and he's been a dear friend and mentor ever since. For me and hundreds of others, the Ebony Repertory has become an artistic home on the West Coast. In the years that have passed, thanks to time spent onstage at the theater, in rehearsal rooms, in the audience and in relationship with Mr. Brown, I have been able to mature and develop as an actor, a producer, a creator and a citizen. Wren inspires and nurtures zealous commitment to it all. His friendship and mentorship has made a huge difference in my life and in the lives of countless Angelenos. A fourth generation Angeleno himself, Wren has made his city a more welcoming and culturally vibrant place to live.\n\nCordae is making music that represents what is going on in the world now and even outside of music, he is doing a lot of activist work. I think he's making, and will continue to make, Black history using his platform to fight for social justice. His knowledge and his lyrical genius is way beyond his age. I think he's going to play a major role in creating change in music and in this world.\n\nHarry Belafonte hasn't just moved the needle for the year, he has devoted his life. He put his life and his career at risk to stand up against the systematic racism that has plagued us for many years. He leads by example and I'm a product of his example. There is no person more influential to me, no soul that ignites me with joy and inspiration like he does.\n\nAmanda Gorman is a young African-American woman who is a shining example to young people of what can happen when you work hard. When she was given the platform as the inaugural poet, not only did she rise to the occasion, she became the beacon of light for everyone who heard her that day. She influenced Americans, young and old, of all races and religions, with her words. With her words, she was able to relate to the emotional climate of today and inspire hope. As an artist, I always strive to create positive energy and make people feel good. It is amazing to see this young 22-year-old with a positive message .\n\nA symbol of ordinary Americans stepping up to meet the needs of their community in extraordinary times, Rep. Cori Bush has risen to the forefront of the fight for racial equity and social justice in America. Originally serving her community as a nurse, pastor and community activist, Rep. Bush was motivated to enter politics working as a triage nurse during the protests in Ferguson following the killing of Michael Brown by police in 2014. By fiercely and unapologetically representing her community in St. Louis, Bush upset a 10-term incumbent in a congressional primary last year, and at only 44 years young, she became the first African-American woman elected to Congress from the state of Missouri . America and the city of St. Louis will benefit from the clarity of her voice and vision for decades to come.\n\nKane Brown is a guy that has expanded the reach of country music beyond its boundaries. Through his style of dress, he can exist in places that many traditional country artists can't go. But, as soon as they hear his voice , they realize he's a country boy, which in turn pulls people back into the country music format to dig more into Kane's music as well as other country artists.\n\nMickey Guyton uses her voice to push for equality, not only Black people in country music, but women of all cultural backgrounds. Mickey Guyton uses her voice to push for equality, not only Black people in country music, but women of all cultural backgrounds. She doesn't shy away from who she is in the face of prejudice. Her courage inspires younger females to continue to be who they are and not be ashamed of it.\n\nLike everyone, I was greatly affected by everything surrounding George Floyd. So, I did what I do best - sat down at my piano and tried to compose some delicate endearing words in a story from a mother to her son. Since I had this song, I wanted to put visuals to the meaning of the music and lyrics to make my words as impactful as possible, so that people could possibly better learn about the Black Lives Matter movement from song. I connected with a business acquaintance, Stanley Lumax, and his lovely wife. They also had an African Ethiopian connection with me, which I loved. We worked together on coming up with the visualization to the song. Stanley and his wife then introduced me to the work of Flo Ngala. I was tremendously impressed by her honesty. I studied Flo's work and was so enamored by her photographs and visuals. I especially connected because of her New York City connection, as I had become sort of a native, as I decided to set new roots down to aid in my search for a new home where I could grow artistically. When I saw Flo's images, I immediately connected with those iconic images and saw within them the same connection that I had connected to \"If I Have A Son.\" Those images told exactly what was going on in my song. The photos were the harsh truth about frustration of the situation but beautifully done.\n\nDr. Maxine Mimms founded Evergreen State College-Tacoma campus over 45 years ago. And at 92 years old, she is living history , having been an educator for over half a century and an activist for even longer. She was/is peer, sister, friend to the likes of Maya Angelou, Odetta, Abby Lincoln, Jessye Norman, Cicely Tyson, Nina Simone, Oprah Winfrey ...And even now, in the 21st year of the 21st century, she continues to inspire people of all ages. She's been a GREAT inspiration to me, more than I have space to express here. For all the way she touches and is BELOVED by so many of all ages, a true living oracle, I would LOVE to nominate Dr. Maxine Mimms.\n\nGina Clayton-Johnson is the founder and executive director of Essie Justice Group , a nonprofit organization of women with incarcerated loved ones taking on the rampant injustices created by mass incarceration. An overlooked effect of mass incarceration is that a staggering one in four women, and nearly one in two Black women, has a family member in prison. Gina is making Black history now because she's doing visionary and groundbreaking work that starts with the thesis that to transform the criminal justice system, women impacted by incarceration must organize. Essie Justice Group is one of the only Black woman-led organizations in the country to do this sort of advocacy in recognizing the power of women impacted by the system to heal, build power and drive social change.\n\nI've often wondered what it would have been like to be alive when Zora Neale Hurston and James Baldwin and Ralph Ellison were writing their classic novels; when Maya Angelou and Toni Morrison were writing their classics in the 1960s and 1970s. I would have loved to buy their books when they came out, to be able to slink into a crowd and witness these legends speak about their new books. But my envy of past generations has been eclipsed by my appreciation for our living legends, like novelist Jesmyn Ward . The first and only woman to win the National Book Award for Fiction twice for \"Salvage the Bones\" and \"Sing, Unburied Sing,\" Ward is Black history walking, a novelist Americans will be reading for a long time, like Zora, James, Ralph, Maya and Toni. Despite her genius, I don't think Ward gets enough recognition. Don't let this Black History Month go by without reading one of her books.\n\nIbram X. Kendi is the Andrew W. Mellon Professor in the Humanities at Boston University and the founding director of the BU Center for Antiracist Research . He is the author of many books including his most recent novel, 'Four Hundred Souls: A Community History of African America, 1619-2019,' which he co-edited with Keisha N. Blain.\n\nIn the coming years, it is essential that we have our perspectives reflected in front of and behind the camera lenses. When I look at the inspirational and provocative work of Sam Vibes, I get excited for the future of photography. Though just starting out, the images he creates bring passion, freedom and beauty to his subjects. I have no doubt we will be seeing his name along the likes of Tyler Mitchell and Dana Scruggs one day.\n\nWhen I think of who is changing the world Dr. Ayana Elizabeth Johnson comes to mind. The marine biologist works at the intersection of climate change and racial justice; whether she is running her think tank, Urban Ocean Lab, or hosting the podcast, How to Save a Planet, she is actively expanding the conversation around anti-racism and environmental justice. Her tenacity and collaborative grassroots approach ensures that people of color get equal protection from the worst effects of the climate crisis. I find Johnson's voice invigorating and more importantly, undaunted by what can feel like an enormous, almost unfixable problem. I yell into the void, \"Global warming is ruining the planet. We are doomed!\" and she whispers, \"Make the plan. Implement the plan.\" She urges us to make conscious decisions that shift the way we live on the planet. She is motivated by a practical sense of self-determination and focuses on building community. She understands that the environmental movement must address its legacy of systemic racism. Johnson is recruiting everyone to do the work - not just scientists and government officials. And I am joining her. Together we are imagining a different reality; one where we embrace collective care and take advantage of the untapped possibilities of our planet.\n\nGlory Edim is the author of \"Well-Read Black Girl.\"\n\nI think it is proper and even perhaps necessary to bring a nomination for Julieanna Richardson for her contributions to creating and continuing The Black HistoryMakers . Julieanna has sought artists, teachers, businesspeople and community workers, among others, to bring attention to their contribution just as you are bringing attention to hers. The people who stayed behind after slavery, with Jim Crow, with rioting and lynching are frequently overlooked. They have not sought nor shown an interest in the limelight. They went to church each Sunday, fed the hungry, healed as best they could the sick, hidden those running from mobs. Julieanna has sought those who know those stories. And there are stories yet about urban removal taking the communities they built; watching the churches they have built brick by brick be bombed; burying those who have been shot in the back because of cowardice by police and the so called neighborhood watchers. Julieanna is seeking through The HistoryMakers to do her best to see these wonderful people are not forgotten. She is a true heroine.\n\nDon't sleep on Eve L. Ewing . She's a poet, writer and sociologist who has long been holding up a mirror to America. Chicago Magazine wrote \"Ignore Eve L. Ewing at your own intellectual, political, and cultural risk.\" Which says it all. From her collections of poetry - including \"1919: Poems,\" which chronicles the Chicago race massacre to her nonfiction work, \"Ghosts in the Schoolyard,\" a book breaking down the history of the broken system not only of Chicago's public schools but of the public school system in general, to her comic books and middle-grade novel and so much other incredibly thoughtful and brilliant work - Eve L. Ewing continues to, in the words of the late Congressman John Lewis, make good trouble while making us think deeply about our country and the bigger world.\n\nAshley Bryan is indubitably the most impressive and important living author for children. I'd even go as far as to say he's one of the most important living Americans. At 97 years old, he's the author of over 40 books for kids, including \"Freedom Over Me,\" a book in which Bryan takes real advertisements from slave auctions and imagines the lives of the people being sold, posthumously restoring their humanity. His heart is as big as his smile, and his voice as he recites from memory poems from Hughes and Rilke - call-and-response style - is a balm on any bad day. Once, I had breakfast with him and asked him what the secret was to a long life. I think he'd just turned 93 and was eating a tower of pancakes like a 16-year-old. He responded, \"Honestly, I don't have many survival skills.\" He shrugged, then continued, \"All I know is every day I wake up excited about making art.\"\n\nJason Reynolds is the New York Times best-selling author of \"All American Boys,\" \"Long Way Down,\" and \"Miles Morales-Spiderman.\" He is also the author of \"Look Both Ways\" and more.\n\nOne of my greatest sources of inspiration is a small - though mighty! - bastion of inclusive children's literature named Dhonielle Clayton . She not only serves as the COO of We Need Diverse Books (the organization founded in 2014 that shed a spotlight on the lack of diversity in books written for kids and teens, and that continues to hold publishers' feet to the fire), but also brings her knowledge and experience as both a former librarian and middle school teacher to her own works of fiction, and to the projects she helms as the owner and mastermind of Cake Literary , the incredible book packaging company behind a number of New York Times bestselling children's books. Dhonielle is co-author of the novel that inspired the Netflix Original show, \"Tiny Pretty Things,\" and the author of my favorite YA fantasy series, \"The Belles.\" AND she came up with idea for \"Blackout,\" a multi-authored YA novel of interlinked Black love stories that will hit shelves in June. Slowly and silently, Dhonielle is changing the *kidlit* game. I can't think of anyone who deserves more flowers than she does.\n\nNic Stone is the author of The Vanished (Shuri: A Black Panther Novel #2), on sale February 2, 2021\n\nI nominate Andrea Davis Pinkney . As a young African American male openly engaging in society, I have often found strength and courage from qualities that represent my home: a strong African American woman. Andrea, through her work and service, embodies the characteristics required for universal growth. Through numerous books for children and young adults, including historical fiction and nonfiction, Andrea infuses hope, empowerment and the encouragement needed to keep African American culture moving forward. She has taught me kindness resolves cruelty and that faith can outlast pain. Andrea has contributed more than 50 children's books and has inspired a plethora of authors, myself included. Andrea has spent her lifetime fueling the Black American community with love, hope and education. She has worked tirelessly behind the scenes to fight for a better future for us all. I think it is appropriate to encourage the encourager. Andrea has earned that respect tenfold.\n\nMalcolm Mitchell is a Super Bowl champion and author of \"My Very Favorite Book in the Whole Wide World.\"\n\nLong before the #metoo movement had a name, Kenyette Tisha Barnes was laying the groundwork for a crisis that would eventually capture national attention. Barnes' activism began in the late 1990s when she spoke out about sexual abuse allegations against popular R &B singer, R. Kelly. Her cries went largely unheard, save for a few Chicago-based journalists. Fast forward to 2017, as allegations continued to mount, Barnes teamed up with Oronike Odeleye to form #MuteRKelly , with the goal of spotlighting his alleged abuses against young girls of color and preventing him from performing at an Atlanta concert. This soon spurred more cancelled concerts and provided the framework for the groundbreaking Surviving R. Kelly documentary. Barnes' work in human trafficking and social justice gives a voice to the voiceless. While Kelly continues to plead his innocence from jail, where he is awaiting trial, Barnes is literally changing the landscape for Black women and girls, reminding them of their purpose and the power of their collective voices. It's time we give Ms. Barnes her flowers now.\n\nTami Charles is the author of \"Muted.\"\n\nEditor's note: As reported by ABC News, R &B singer R. Kelly remains jailed in Chicago after pleading not guilty to dozens of state and federal sexual misconduct charges in Illinois, Minnesota and New York. A federal judge rejected a request from Kelly to be temporarily released from prison over fears he might contract coronavirus while in the facility. Women have come forward to share their stories of multitudes of alleged abuses from prostitution and solicitation charges to sexual abuse charges over the course of 25 years. In March 2020, federal prosecutors accused Kelly of having unprotected sex with a girl in 2015 without informing her that he had herpes. In August 2020, federal prosecutors announced charges against three men accused of threatening women who have accused Kelly of abuse. His federal trial in the Eastern District of New York is scheduled for April 7, 2021.\n\nBefore I knew Kelly Starling Lyons , I knew of her work. Her first picture book was in my home library, featured on my website, speaking to me. \"One Million Men And Me\" is about the 1995 Million Man March as seen through a young Black girl's eyes. It was published by a small press. But the author was going to be a big deal one day. I was certain of it. Before any literary honors were bestowed on her or lines of eager children were clamoring for her autograph, Kelly burned the midnight oil writing and perfecting her craft. In 17 years, she has written 18 books. In each one, Black children are seen and centered, and young readers of all backgrounds are affirmed and encouraged to stand tall and proud. These young people know, as I and the children's literature world have known for a while now, Kelly is a gifted writer and storyteller, a literary treasure.\n\nSharon G. Flake is the author of \"The Life I'm In.\"\n\nDaughter of Rev. James Bevel, one of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.'s top lieutenants, Chevara Orrin is a significant force in today's social justice movement. A survivor of incest and sexual and domestic violence, she is best known for having conceived and co-created We Are Straight Allies , a national marketing campaign to support equality and move towards passage of inclusive policies to protect the LGBTQ community, along with #WhiteAndWoke, an initiative to raise awareness about racial inequality and promote equity through intentional action. The successful Allies campaign has drawn the participation of prominent figures such as feminist icon Gloria Steinem, Olympic gold medalist and civil rights attorney Nancy Hogshead-Makar, cultural and faith leaders, and superstars from the corporate world, including the CEOs of Florida Blue and SunTrust Bank. Chevara is executive producer of an independent documentary, \"The Story of Denise,\" which explores the transgender experience and family acceptance. She is currently working on a documentary, \"Why is Washington Still Burning?\" featuring her mother Sue Orrin and Rabbi Arthur Waskow, who were activists along with her father in the '60s. The film, exhibit and curriculum aim to move white Americans beyond guilt and saviorism to a radical re-evaluation of their privilege and to action for racial equity. Chevara has been recognized by the White House and the Human Rights Campaign as a leader, advocate and ally for the LGBTQ community, and featured in publications including The Washington Post, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Tikkun Magazine and The Feminist Wire.\n\nMary-Frances Winters is the CEO of The Winters Group, a glob diversity and inclusion consulting firm and author of \"Black Fatigue: How Racism Erodes the Mind, Body, and Spirit.\"\n\nOwn \"eloquent rage as your superpower,\" Dr. Brittney Cooper says, in her New York Times bestselling book. The Rutgers University professor has channeled her fury at sexist and racist oppression into a unique position as a feminist theologian and public intellectual. The movement for Black liberation has always needed great thinkers and orators. Through her work as an educator; co-founder of the Crunk Feminist Collective ; author of books, including the bestselling \"Eloquent Rage: A Black Feminist Discovers Her Superpower\" ; political punditry, preaching and speaking, Dr. Cooper does what these leaders have always done -- make the people's pain plain, dig out hypocrisies and demand justice. A daughter of the South, Dr. Cooper is distinctly eloquent when revealing the power of the Black church to uplift and maim, liberate and constrict. Recent events demonstrate there is much to be done before America can claim all its people are free. Dr. Cooper's scholarship and activism will help power that work for many years to come.\n\nTamara Winfrey-Harris is the author of Dear Black Girl: Letters from Your Sisters on Stepping into your Power.\n\nAs an entrepreneur, teacher, author and advocate, Jessamyn Stanley is nothing short of awe-inspiring. I believe her to be a healer, and a force in making the often homogeneous wellness space an uplifting, fun and approachable place for every body. I will continue to take her courses, read her book and laugh along to her candid social media pages because she enriches my life and the lives of so many folks around the world.\n\nI am extremely inspired by the work of 2BG (2 Black Girls) Consulting , founded by Chrissy Rutherford and Danielle Prescod . The pair began the agency in 2020 as they received a number of personal requests from brands asking how best to respond to the Black Lives Matter Movement in the wake of the murders of George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery. With experience in the fashion, beauty and entertainment industries, Chrissy and Danielle are influential voices in the digital space and beyond, and are now using their platforms to educate brands and businesses through their consulting services and anti-racism seminar. The seminar takes you through do's and don'ts of anti-racism in the workplace, how to be an actionable ally and the historical context of how racism relates to varying industries. As a Black millennial navigating my career and learning to gain confidence taking space in the workplace, 2BG and the work Chrissy and Danielle are doing motivates me to continue to be vocal about the Black Lives Matter Movement and educate myself as an active participant in our current cultural climate. Seriously, I learn something new or inspiring from these two on the daily! So thank you, Chrissy and Danielle, you've impacted my life over the past year so much more than you know!\n\nI would love to nominate my husband, Yinka Lawanson aka Lamboginny for this great honor to be recognized amongst other great, influential Black men and women doing tremendous work around the globe. Yinka is a Nigerian recording artist who, through his musical talents and passion for the incarcerated, birthed the organization Saving All Lives Together , also known as S.A.L.T. Since founding the organization a little over a decade ago, Lamboginny has worked tirelessly with lawyers to bring freedom to over 120 wrongfully imprisoned men in Nigeria, carefully crafted an in-depth book for transformation while in prison, titled \"I Am Not in a Prison, I Am in a Waiting Room,\" and incorporated his music therapy concerts in prisons across Africa, the U.K. and now the United States. Yinka's passion is to continue to spread the message of hope, love and transformation for inmates around the world. Yinka always says, \"In order for an inmate to return to the society and be an asset to the community, wouldn't we want them to be truly reformed?\" I would love to see Yinka acknowledged for his amazing efforts, as he is one of the humblest people I know. Everything he does is for the betterment of mankind and for that, I am grateful to know him and have someone like him in the world.\n\nIt is my pleasure to name Dr. Joia Crear-Perry as an influential figure who is making Black history in maternal and infant health. She is an OB-GYN who has worked tirelessly to change the approach to birth in the United States and improve health outcomes for Black women. During a time of increased focus on addressing pregnancy-related deaths in this country, Dr. Crear-Perry has been a powerful voice for those who are not able to speak or who may not be heard. She has worked on educating her counterparts on how biases in the health system and clinical care impact maternal care and outcomes. As a Black maternal health scholar and advocate, Dr. Crear-Perry is the founder and President of the National Birth Equity Collaborative and a board member of Black Mamas Matter Alliance. In addition, she has authored numerous scientific publications and addressed numerous audiences, including the United Nations and the U.S. Congress, to make the case that the marked inequities that exist must be urgently addressed, highlighting the impacts of racism on Black women's health. I admire her unwavering commitment and resolve to find and highlight practical solutions to eliminate maternal mortality, address disparities and improve the birth experience, especially for women of color. Her important and inspirational work is paving a path toward a better tomorrow for all women, children and families.\n\nDr. Wanda Barfield is the Director of the Division of Reproductive Health (DRH) in CDC's National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion.\n\nDr. Olutoyin A. Olutoye, MD, M.Sc. , is a professor of anesthesia, pediatrics, and obstetrics and gynecology at Baylor College of Medicine. She also serves as the vice chief of Academic Affairs and division chief of General Anesthesiology for Texas Children's Hospital, and is a faculty senator and vice chair for Faculty Development at Baylor College of Medicine. Her interests include the effect of drugs on the fetus and the fetal brain during maternal-fetal surgery as well as the effect of pediatric obesity on the efficacy of anesthesia drugs. She is a fellow in the American Academy of Pediatrics, and a member of the American Society of Anesthesiologists, International Fetal Medicine and Surgery Society, Society for Pediatric Anesthesia and Texas Society for Anesthesiologists. The reason I am nominating her is because she is one of the modern-day \"hidden figures.\" In a year where the entire country is grappling with the systemic impact of racism and other forms of prejudice that create clear divides between the \"haves and the have-nots,\" academic medicine in particular continues to be a space where minoritized individuals, especially women of color, seemingly have to achieve twice as much to be seen as half as good. However the professional achievements of Mrs. Dr. Olutoye deserve equal recognition. In addition to that, over the past few years, Mrs. Dr. Olutoye has endured the loss of her mother, the marriage of her son, her daughter passing the bar, and the birth of her first grandchild, all while being a professor during a global pandemic unlike any the world has ever seen; working on the front lines in a specialty that literally puts one face-to-face with the droplets that everyone else is trying to avoid; and doing so for the smallest and most vulnerable of little humans. Additionally, she and her husband have been physically separated due to the current personal and professional circumstances in their lives, yet they have continued to put their faith in the Lord, and be a shining example of what Black love and Black excellence can, and does, look like ... in addition to celebrating the strong Black woman that she is.\n\nDr. Feranmi Okanlami is an assistant professor of Family Medicine, Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, and Urology at Michigan Medicine.\n\nI chose Rev. Elizabeth \"Liz\" Walker as my nominee based on the impressive work she has been doing to restore trust in the communities of color, which is needed. Lives have been changed and families reunited based on the work she has done. She is all about the people! Rev. Walker is a minister, humanitarian, and a community activist who promotes healing and interfaith dialogue. As a pastor of Roxbury Presbyterian Church (RPC) located in the heart of Boston, she started and serves as the executive director of The Cory Johnson Program for Post-Traumatic Healing (CJP) . The CJP is a faith-inspired, clinically supported community-based program that addresses various forms of trauma, and was named for a young aspiring RPC church youth member who was murdered. The program also improves access to mental health services and empowers community members to take an active role in helping themselves and others heal. The CJP has served over 6,000 people since it started in 2014, and has been replicated in seven different locations around Massachusetts and three other states. Rev. Walker's work around raising awareness about historical trauma and racial disparities led her to become co-chair of King Boston, a nonprofit organization commemorating the legacies of Martin Luther King Jr. and Coretta Scott King, culminating in the future memorial on the Boston Common and the King Center for Economic Justice. She helped found the Jane Doe Safety Fund , a multimillion-dollar, state-wide anti-violence initiative that works on policy and supports domestic abuse shelters and safe houses in Massachusetts.\n\n\"The persistent health inequities in our society stifle the opportunity of many to contribute fully to the future of our nation,\" says Dr. Rachel Hardeman , a health equity researcher whose work has and will continue to change the culture of medicine and medical education. She is an associate professor and the first Blue Cross-endowed Professor of Health and Racial Equity , at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, Division of Health Policy & Management.\n\nDr. Renee Crichlow is the Chief Medical Officer of Codman Square Health Center, Boston.\n\nRaquel Willis is a Black trans woman whose activism, journalism, and organizing has helped to reinforce the rallying cry that all Black lives matter. Her work in centering the most marginalized in our Black community provides all of us with the blueprint for true liberation. Thank you, Raquel, for being yourself. By owning your truth as a woman, you've shown me how to be a better man.\n\nIt's my honor to nominate John Hope Bryant , as his story of going from a homeless teenager to the founder of Operation Hope is a beacon for all Americans. John has dedicated his life to helping thousands reach financial literacy and is a trailblazer in navigating so many through long existing, currently highlighted, racial and political divisions. John's continued successes in addressing income and wealth inequality give recipients and givers alike opportunity to achieve their American dreams. It brings me great joy to witness the positive impact John continues to bring to our social fabric.\n\nJohn W. Rogers Jr. was the first minority founder of an investment firm in 1983 (at the young age of 24 years!) and grew it to a business that today as $14.6 billion in assets. He also founded the Ariel Community Academy (ACA) - a public school in the South Side of Chicago dedicated to providing financial literacy to underserved children. Most of the enrolled students are African Americans and receive subsidized lunches. ACA incorporates a financial education curriculum that aims to educate students on investing basics. Ariel provides each first-grade class with a $20,000 investment portfolio and allows the class to make their own investment decisions.\n\nYou cannot put Ohun Ashe in a box. Not only is she a thoughtful leader in the fight for Black lives - organizing from the frontlines of Ferguson, to the marches for justice for Anthony Lamar Smith, to our protest group #ExpectUS in St. Louis - she is leading the way to build Black economic power in St. Louis through her website, For The Culture STL . Through her inspiring work, Ohun has connected hundreds of Black-owned restaurants, retailers and other businesses with new customers. As we build a St. Louis that works for everyone, we carry gratitude and love for the grassroots history-makers like Ohun at the heart of realizing the change our communities urgently need.\n\nOur granddaughters will read about warrior for equity and justice Gina Clayton-Johnson in their history books as the beating heart behind the BREATHE Act , a federal bill that charts a blueprint for addressing the compounding impacts of structural racism and inequality through community reinvestment. Gina is the founder of Essie Justice Group, which harnesses the collective power of women with incarcerated loved ones to end mass incarceration's harm to women and communities of color. Gina and her team do critical work in my hometown of Compton, California, and around the country, bringing to light how our criminal justice system disproportionately burdens poor people with financial costs (phone calls, visits, commissary bills, attorney fees) and emotional trauma. She is a Harvard-trained lawyer. She is directly affected by the systemic issues that she so fiercely challenges. She is a \"she-ro\" investing her time and expertise to re-envision justice and enact liberation.\n\nJotaka Eaddy is the person I will nominate as a young person who is already a Black history-maker now and I'm sure she will be recognized as a Black history-maker in the future. Jotaka is amazing and she is a complete renaissance woman in every way. I call her the Harriett Tubman of the Silicon Valley and the Mary McLeod Bethune of the United Nation. She is an extraordinary woman.\n\nI am nominating Kerby Jean-Raymond , the designer and founder of Pyer Moss . I first became aware of his work when he made a shirt during Fashion Week in 2014 honoring the life of Mike Brown, amongst other victims of police violence -- and he did this before using one's platform to discuss police violence was popular. He was willing to take risks in an industry that did not readily address social justice because he knew it was the right thing to do for Black people. Since then, he has continued to use all of his platforms to elevate Blackness -- to show the beauty, complexity, history, and joy in and of Black culture. He inspires me and countless others to continue to stand in the things that we know are true, especially when we are standing up for justice.\n\nWhen I think of who I would absolutely trust to steer us to freedom, Malkia Devich-Cyril is one of the first to come to mind. A leader in the tech and ethics world, Mac is a defender of net neutrality, a believer in racial equality and fighter for media justice. Mac founded MediaJustice, a digital justice organization, in 2009 at a time when many folks weren't yet considering the real and scary implications of technology on marginalized people. MediaJustice has created discourse, interventions, and recommendations for an open and affordable internet, digital surveillance, high-tech policing and prisons, and big tech and platform accountability. A tireless organizer, Mac also built the MediaJustice Network, a collective that hosts organizations and advocates to mobilize and organize when needed. A child of the Black Panthers and an Oakland proud stud, Mac encompasses the best parts of humanity. Even through tremendous personal loss, Mac continues to be a beacon that shines light and possibility into the darkest of places, on and offline.

      "text": "5 black photographers reflect on their art and Tyler Mitchell's history-making Vogue cover\n\n\"GMA\" spoke to five black photographers about their work and the Vogue cover.\n\nA picture can tell a story.\n\nFor Vogue's September cover , there's an underlying story of hope.\n\nIn Vogue magazine's 126-year history, a black photographer never shot its cover. Tyler Mitchell , a 23-year-old recent graduate from New York University Tisch School of the Arts, broke that cycle when he was selected to photograph the one and only Beyoncé Knowles-Carter for the coveted September issue.\n\nThis moment is one to be infinitely celebrated: Tyler Mitchell is the first black photographer to shoot a Vogue cover -- especially, the all-important September issue.\n\nMitchell, a Brooklyn-based artist, tweeted he cried three times since the cover image was published and was floored by the attention his work has received. But when it comes to creative representation, it's important to black artists that the momentum does not start and end with a \"first.\"\n\n\"Until there is a mosaic of perspectives coming from different ethnicities behind the lens,\" Knowles-Carter told Vogue, \"we will continue to have a narrow approach and view of what the world actually looks like.\"\n\n\"Good Morning America\" spoke to five black photographers about their work, their stories, and their feelings on Vogue's history-making cover. Here's a tiny mosaic of perspectives to capture what the world really looks like.\n\nTell me a bit about your journey in the creative world.\n\nI've done photography for six years now, but I've always been someone who took photos. A lot of photographers used Tumblr as a way to create their aesthetic which is crazy because that same aesthetic we created then is what is dominating magazines now: the flowers, natural hair, etc. These are the aesthetics that young black photographers have been pushing on social media for the last six to eight years. Being able to use these online spaces has allowed us to create this little global community of artists, who are all connecting on this shared desire to generate more imagery of people that look like us.\n\nWhy do you create your art?\n\nWe're constantly presented with images of people who don't look like us. I want to contribute to as much imagery as possible where I show black people in modes of love and happiness, joy and creativity, and within the black and brown diaspora. I love the exchange. That's what inspires me most: Meeting a person, and wanting to capture their genuine authentic self, because there is a need of this imagery to exist to affirm that this person existed. This person is real.\n\nTyler Mitchell is the first black photographer to shoot a cover for Vogue in all of its history -- 126 years. Are you surprised?\n\nIt isn't surprising to me that it's been 126 years. I know it takes time to break these barriers down, but, now, this moment has opened an entire gate for so many people. It's monumental for everyone that's trying to be a creative in a space that is literally not made for you. The cameras we use were built for white people to register white skin tones and not dark skin tones. Tyler's success is the result of something that the entire community has been working towards.\n\nYou can find more of Mahaneela's work on Instagram @mahaneela.jpg and www.mahaneela.com.\n\nWhy do you create your art?\n\nI find myself being completely drawn to affirming black women through visuals. It is therapeutic for me, and that's how I look at my photography: as a restorative healing practice. Photoshoots are merely a beautiful exchange between me and another black woman. There's an unspoken bond we immediately have because of our shared experience. Sometimes people tell me, \"You have no idea how the way you affirm and celebrate me helps me see myself the way God sees me.\"\n\nTell me about what inspires you.\n\nI am inspired, for one, by my relationship with God. That is the foundation in everything I do and how I see the world and marginalized people. It inspires me to serve, and I serve best through empowering black women by reminding them of their beauty, brilliance and their capability to shift culture. I want to be able to create experiences in art that I didn't necessarily see growing up.\n\nA black photographer has never shot the cover of Vogue in 126 years up until now. What are your thoughts around representation in the creative industry?\n\nI love Vogue, and I think their work is beautiful, but it feels very intentional for them to not have had a black photographer shoot their cover in all of its history. There are so many black people who come from different walks of life, have so many different perspectives, and are able to bring something unique out of their subjects. Sometimes, it's not your story to tell. And if that's the case, you should employ somebody who can and should tell that story.\n\nYou can find more of Deun Ivory's work on Instagram @deunivory and www.deunivory.me.\n\nTell me a bit about your photography:\n\nI started in 2012, but art has always been in my life. My mom is a singer in Ghana and my dad is a songwriter, so I come from a creative background. I usually photograph black people mainly because the stories of black people are the only stories I feel equipped to tell. In my photos, I've learned to do a lot of color play.\n\nHow has your experience been with navigating the creative industry?\n\nI feel like most of the problems I face especially as a black artist is feeling like my value is depreciated. And not only in terms of money, but sometimes, you just don't get that spot that you deserve. Since I am from and live in Ghana, I mostly encounter these problems when I try to secure a job, and it is usually due to where I am based.\n\nTyler Mitchell is the first black photographer to shoot a cover for Vogue in all of its history -- 126 years. How did you feel?\n\nI first thought, wow, he's the same age as me. I love it when I see young people break barriers, because if he could do it, I could also do it. It's just a matter of time. The photos were beautiful -- and the fact that he shot Beyoncé? That's more of a reason to be inspired. However, at the end of the day, I think it's important for black artists to remember that regardless of our representation, we have great minds and intelligence, we're creative, and the art we create is powerful. No matter what happens, we'll still create.\n\nYou can find more of Prince Gyasi's work on Instagram @princejyesi.\n\nThere are so many ways to tell stories. Why photography?\n\nThrough photography, I am able to capture an idea that's based in reality, while also flirting with fantasy and futurism. A lot of the work I do is centered around exploring revolutionary ideologies within black culture, and thinking about [the] diaspora and how I can create content for an entire people. Growing up, I feel like we haven't really had a depiction of our people throughout history. Everything was in our imagination. I try to explore that.\n\nTell us about your experience navigating the creative industry:\n\nWithin the larger photo industry, it is definitely a bit more difficult to navigate. However, what's sick about photography in our day and age is how there is this entire creative family of photographers and models and other artists. We create spaces, we thrive in those spaces, and we love each other in those spaces.\n\nTyler Mitchell is the first black photographer to shoot a cover for Vogue in all of its history -- 126 years. What are your thoughts on \"firsts\"?\n\nWhen I first heard the news, I was like, \"Oh, this is crazy.\" But then, this rush of excitement was followed by this lackadaisical feeling where I was like, \"Really, this is the first time?\" Though we should definitely celebrate firsts, we should also be ashamed that it's taking this long for so many doors to be open to black people for the first time. It gives hope to myself and other people in the photo community. I hope it doesn't take a long time to get another black photographer, or a black woman -- that should be their next step.\n\nYou can find more of Bobby Rogers' work on Instagram @bobbyrogers_ and www.bobby-rogers.com.\n\nTell me a bit about your photography:\n\nI started photography in early 2015, originally with fashion. I'm from Lagos, Nigeria, and we're known for the \"shine shine\" -- as the entertainment city of the entire continent [of Africa]. I then took a job as a photographer for a nonprofit in Liberia. I'd always been interested more so in documentary photojournalism, so deciding to move to Liberia was just a step for me to get further into the documentary world.\n\nWhat inspires your art?\n\nI've always loved stories. My first job was in this public library shelving books, and I remember coming across the international section, which was really more so the African section. I saw this huge book by Angela Fisher and Carol Beckwithe; I remember looking through the images and seeing these representations of African ethnic groups from all over the continent that I have never seen before. After that, I started thinking more seriously about the stories of people I share.\n\nThoughts on representation in the creative industry:\n\nIn my field, there appears to be this active push for representation when we look at media. However, it's not just about [the] representation of stories, but more so, the storytellers. I think there needs to be a more active push for cultural exchanges within media. Imagine if western media came to the continent and interacted with the creatives and photographers and journalists on [the] ground -- we could have an exchange on how to properly tell each other stories.\n\nYou can find more of Yagazie Emezi's work on Instagram @yagazieemezi and www.yagazieemezi.com.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Justin Bieber issues statement acknowledging he has 'benefited off of black culture'\n\nHe said his music, fashion and style have all been influenced by black culture.\n\nJustin Bieber is vowing to do his part to stop racial injustice.\n\nIn a note shared with his 138 million Instagram followers on Saturday, Bieber opened up about how black culture has played a role in shaping his career.\n\n\"I am inspired by black culture,\" he wrote. \"I have benefited off of black culture. My style, how I sing, dance, perform, and my fashion have all been influenced and inspired by black culture.\"\n\nThe \"Yummy\" singer added, \"I am committed to using my platform from this day forward to learn, to speak up about racial injustice and systemic oppression, and to identify ways to be a part of much needed change.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time Bieber has been vocal in his support of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nHe recently shared an update about George Floyd's case and information on how to continue seeking justice for Breonna Taylor .\n\nHe even encouraged his American fans to get out and vote even though he's Canadian and can't participate.\n\nThis is a big difference from the videos that surfaced of a then 15-year-old Bieber using the N-word as he turned his hit \"One Less Lonely Girl\" into a parody about joining the KKK and killing black people. The 26-year-old pop star issued an apology for his actions in December 2019.\n\nSharing a post that said \"Stand Against Racism,\" he wrote, \"When I was young I was uneducated and found myself saying really hurtful things not knowing the power of my words. Racism Is still very prevalent and I want to use my voice to remind we are all human being and all of EQUAL VALUE BEFORE GOD!\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
