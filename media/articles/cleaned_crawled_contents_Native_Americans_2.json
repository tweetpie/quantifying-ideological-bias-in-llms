      "text": "JD Vance called Native Americans the 'enemy' and Indigenous Peoples Day a 'fake holiday'\n\nComments that Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) made about Indigenous people have recently resurfaced, and they could cause a headache for former President Donald Trump's campaign among Native American voters.\n\nThe Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported Tuesday that when Vance argued last year against renaming the Wayne National Forest in Ohio, he referred to Native Americans as the \"enemy.\" On another occasion, the GOP's 2024 vice presidential nominee called Indigenous People's Day - which some cities celebrate instead of Columbus Day - a \"fake holiday.\"\n\nWayne National forest is named for Major General Anthony Wayne , who massacred Indigenous people during the Northwest Indian War, most notably during the Battle of Fallen Timbers in present-day Maumee, Ohio. When making his case against changing the name of the forest in spite of requests from Indigenous tribes, Vance wrote that \"[Wayne] fought wars and won peace for our government, the government you now serve, and hewed Ohio out of rugged wilderness and occupied enemy territory.\"\n\nMarin Webster Denning, who is a member of the Oneida tribe, said in an interview with the Journal-Sentinel that Native Americans are \"not the enemy.\"\n\n\"There is an occupation, and there are enemies, but revisions of history like this erase us,\" he said.\n\n\"Some people may view [Wayne] as a hero,\" Oneida activist and Milwaukee, Wisconsin resident Jacob Abrams told the paper. \"[B]ut not for us.\"\n\nVance's disparaging comments about a holiday celebrating Indigenous culture in 2021 are also being scrutinized in the wake of the Ohio senator's selection as Trump's running mate. ICT Journalist Mary Annette Pember of the Red Cliff Ojibwe Tribal Nation in Wisconsin dug up a tweet from Vance during President Joe Biden's first year in office in which the eventual Ohio seantor wrote: \"Indigenous Peoples' Day is a fake holiday created to sow division. Of course Joe Biden is the first president to pay it any attention.\"\n\n\"A half a millennium ago Columbus used technology developed in Europe to sail across a giant ocean and discover a new continent. Today we celebrate that daring and ingenuity,\" he wrote in a follow-up tweet. \"Happy Columbus Day!\"\n\nIndigenous People's Day became a substitute for Columbus Day as knowledge of Columbus' brutal enslavement of Indigenous people in the Caribbean broke through into mainstream consciousness. Spanish Dominican priest Bartolomé de las Casas, who accompanied Columbus on several of his expeditions, described some of Columbus' atrocities in his journal.\n\n\"[Spaniards acted] like ravening beasts, killing, terrorizing, afflicting, torturing, and destroying the native peoples, doing all this with the strangest and most varied new methods of cruelty, never seen or heard of before, and to such a degree that this Island of Hispaniola once so populous (having a population that I estimated to be more than three million), has now a population of barely two hundred persons,\" he wrote in 1542. \"And the Christians, with their horses and swords and pikes began to carry out massacres and strange cruelties against them. They attacked the towns and spared neither the children nor the aged nor pregnant women nor women in childbed, not only stabbing them and dismembering them but cutting them to pieces as if dealing with sheep in the slaughter house.\"\n\nVance's comments about Native Americans may hurt the Trump campaign's voter outreach efforts, particularly in Arizona. Biden won the Grand Canyon State by roughly 11,000 votes in 2020, largely due to turnout from Indigenous voters in Navajo country."

(Jessica Plance for KFF Health News)\n\nTescha Hawley learned that hospital bills from her son's birth had been sent to debt collectors only when she checked her credit score while attending a home-buying class. The new mom's plans to buy a house stalled.\n\nHawley said she didn't owe those thousands of dollars in debts. The federal government did.Hawley, a citizen of the Gros Ventre Tribe, lives on the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation in Montana. The Indian Health Service is a federal agency that provides free health care to Native Americans, but its services are limited by a chronic shortage of funding and staff.\n\nHawley's local Indian Health Service hospital wasn't equipped to deliver babies. But she said staff there agreed that the agency would pay for her care at a privately owned hospital more than an hour away.\n\nThat arrangement came through the Purchased/Referred Care program, which pays for services Native Americans can't get through an agency-funded clinic or hospital. Federal law stresses that patients approved for the program aren't responsible for any of the costs.\n\nBut tribal leaders, health officials, and a new federal report say patients are routinely billed anyway as a result of backlogs or mistakes from the Indian Health Service, financial middlemen, hospitals, and clinics.\n\nThe financial consequences for patients can last years. Those sent to collections can face damaged credit scores, which can prevent them from securing loans or require them to pay higher interest rates.\n\nThe December report , by the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, found these long-standing problems contribute to people in Native American-majority communities being nearly twice as likely to have medical debt in collections compared with the national average. And their amount of medical debt is significantly higher.\n\nThe report found the program is often late to pay bills. In some cases, hospitals or collection agencies hound tribal citizens for more money after bills are paid.\n\nHawley's son was born in 2003. She had to wait another year to buy a home, as she struggled to pay off the debt. It took seven years for it to drop from her credit report.\n\n\"I don't think a person ever recovers from debt,\" Hawley said.\n\nHawley, a cancer survivor, still must navigate the referral program. In 2024 alone, she received two notices from clinics about overdue bills.\n\nFrank White Clay, chairman of the Crow Tribe in Montana, testified about the impact of wrongful billing during a U.S. House committee hearing in April. He shared stories of veterans rejected for home loans, elders whose Social Security benefits were reduced, and students denied college loans and federal aid.\n\n\"Some of the most vulnerable people are being harassed daily by debt collectors,\" White Clay said.\n\nNo one is immune from the risk. A high-ranking Indian Health Service official learned during her job's background check that her credit report contained referred-care debt, the federal report found.\n\nNative Americans face disproportionately high rates of poverty and disease , which researchers link to limited access to health care and the ongoing impact of racist federal policies .\n\nWhite Clay is among many who say problems with the referred-care program are an example of the U.S. government violating treaties that promised to provide for the health and welfare of tribes in return for their land.\n\nThe chairman's testimony came during a hearing on the Purchased and Referred Care Improvement Act, which would require the Indian Health Service to create a reimbursement process for patients who were wrongfully billed. Committee members approved the bill in November and sent it for consideration by the full House.\n\nA second federal bill, the Protecting Native Americans' Credit Act , would prevent debt like Hawley's from affecting patients' credit scores. The bipartisan bill hadn't had a hearing by mid-December.\n\nThe exact number of people wrongfully billed isn't clear, but the Indian Health Service has acknowledged it has work to do.\n\nThe agency is developing a dashboard to help workers track referrals and to speed up bill processing, spokesperson Brendan White said. It's also trying to hire more referred-care staff, to address vacancy rates of more than 30%.\n\nOfficials say problems with the program also stem from outside health providers that don't follow the rules.\n\nMelanie Egorin, an assistant secretary at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said at the hearing that the proposed legislation doesn't include consequences for \"bad actors\" - health facilities that repeatedly bill patients when they shouldn't.\n\n\"The lack of enforcement is definitely a challenge,\" she said.\n\nBut tribal leaders warned that penalties could backfire.\n\nWhite Clay told lawmakers that some clinics already refuse to see patients if the Indian Health Service hasn't paid for their previous appointments. He's worried the threat of penalties would lead to more refusals.\n\nIf that happens, White Clay said, Crow tribal members who already travel hours to access specialty treatment would have to go even farther.\n\nThe Consumer Financial Protection Bureau report found clinics are already refusing to see any referred-care patients due to the program's payment problems.\n\nThe bureau and the Indian Health Service also recently published a letter urging health care providers and debt collectors not to hold patients accountable for program-approved care.\n\nWhite, the Indian Health Service spokesperson, said the agency recently updated the referred-care forms sent to outside hospitals and clinics to include billing instructions and to stress that patients aren't liable for any out-of-pocket costs. And he said the staff can help patients get reimbursed if they have already paid for services that were supposed to be covered.\n\nJoe Bryant, an Indian Health Service official who oversees efforts to improve the referral program, said patients can ask credit bureaus to remove debt from their reports if the agency should have covered their bills.\n\nLeaders with the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation in Washington state helped shape the proposed legislation after their citizens were repeatedly harmed by wrongful billing.\n\nTribal Chairman Jarred-Michael Erickson said problems began in 2017, when a regional Indian Health Service office took over the referred-care program from local staff.\n\nIt \"created a domino effect of negative outcomes,\" Erickson wrote in a letter to Congress.\n\nHe said some tribal members whose finances were damaged stopped using the Indian Health Service. Others avoided health care altogether.\n\nResponsibility for the Colville Reservation program transferred back to local staff in 2022. Staffers found the billing process hadn't been completed for thousands of cases, worth an estimated $24 million in medical care, Erickson told lawmakers .\n\nWorkers are making progress on the backlog and they have explained the rules to outside hospitals and clinics, Erickson said. But he said there are still cases of wrongful billing, such as a tribal member who was sent to collections after receiving a $17,000 bill for chemotherapy that the agency was supposed to pay for.\n\nErickson said the tribe is in the process of taking over its health care facilities instead of having the Indian Health Service run them. He and others who work in Native American health said tribally managed units - which are still funded by the federal agency - tend to have fewer problems with their referred-care programs.\n\nFor example, they have more oversight over staff and flexibility to create their own payment tracking systems.\n\nBut some Native Americans oppose tribal management because they feel it releases the federal government from its obligations.\n\nBeyond wrongful billing, access to the referred-care program is limited because of underfunding from Congress. The $1 billion budget this year is $9 billion short of the need, according to a committee report by tribal health and government leaders.\n\nDonald Warne, a physician and member of the Oglala Sioux Tribe in South Dakota, called the proposed legislation a \"band-aid.\" He said the ultimate solution is for Congress to fully fund the Indian Health Service, which would reduce the need for the referred-care program.\n\nBack in Montana, Hawley said she braces for a fight each time she gets a bill that the referral program was supposed to cover.\n\n\"I've learned not to trust the process,\" Hawley said.\n\nSubscribe to KFF Health News' free Morning Briefing.\n\nThis article first appeared on KFF Health News and is republished here under a Creative Commons license."

      "text": "Why Native Americans Are Struggling to Protect Their Sacred Places\n\nForty years ago the U.S. Congress passed the American Indian Religious Freedom Act so that Native Americans could practice their faith freely and that access to their sacred sites would be protected. This came after a 500-year-long history of conquest and coercive conversion to Christianity had forced Native Americans from their homelands.\n\nToday, their religious practice is threatened all over again. On Dec. 4, 2017, the Trump administration reduced the Bears Ears National Monument, an area sacred to Native Americans in Utah, by over 1 million acres. Bears Ears Monument is only one example of the conflict over places of religious value. Many other such sacred sites are being viewed as potential areas for development, threatening the free practice of Native American faith.\n\nWhile Congress created the American Indian Religious Freedom Act to provide \"access to sacred sites,\" it has been open to interpretation. Native Americans still struggle to protect their sacred lands.\n\nLand-based religions\n\nNative Americans have land-based religions, which means they practice their religion within specific geographic locations. As Joseph Toledo, a Jemez Pueblo tribal leader, says, sacred sites are like churches ; they are \"places of great healing and magnetism.\"\n\nSome of these places, as in the case of Bears Ears National Monument , are within federal public lands. As a Native American scholar , I have visited many of these places and felt their power.\n\nFor thousands of years, tribes have used Bears Ears for rituals , ceremonies and collecting medicines used for healing. The different tribes - the Hopi, Navajo, Ute Mountain Ute, Ute Indian Tribe and the Pueblo of Zuni - have worked to protect the land. Together they set up a nongovernmental organization, the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition to help conserve the landscape in 2015.\n\nThe tribes believe Bears Ears is one of the last large undisturbed areas in the lower 48 states and contains the spirits of those who once lived there. Bears Ears Navajo elder Mark Maryboy emphasized, \"It's very important that we protect the earth, the plants, and special ceremonial places in Bears Ears for future generations - not just for Native Americans, but for everybody.\"\n\nSacred landscape\n\nMy great-grandparents, PÃ¡yotayÃ kÏ‡kumei and KayetsÃ¥'Ï‡kumi, (translated as Aims-while-flying-through-the-air and Hollering-in-the-air), were well-known religious leaders on the Blackfeet reservation. They lived in the foothills of the south side of the reservation. However, they went into the mountains and onto public lands in an area now called the Badger-Two Medicine in northcentral Montana to practice their religion.\n\nMy great-grandfather traveled into Badger canyon to trap eagles and gather their feathers which he used in ceremonies and for divine protection. My great-grandmother gathered medicinal plants used in healing ceremonies. Together they prayed and sought solitude in this sacred landscape.\n\nSimilar to Bears Ears, the Badger-Two Medicine , a 130,000-acre area within the Lewis and Clark National Forest, became embroiled in a controversy over potential natural resource development between 1982 and 2017. The Blackfeet tribe argued that these lands were sacred. And that tribal members, such as my great-grandparents, had used these lands for years for spiritual purposes.\n\nThe Blackfeet tribe ultimately succeeded in stopping development, but only after a 35-year-long fight with the Department of Interior, which initially approved almost 50 oil and gas leases. In 2017 Interior Secretary Jewell canceled the last of these leases. This means these public lands will not be used for natural resource development in the future.\n\nNow my family and other Blackfeet, who have used the Badger-Two Medicine for millennia, can use these public lands for their religious practice in solitude.\n\nForty years later\n\nThe reality is, however, that not every dispute between tribes and the U.S. government ends up in favor of the tribes. Historically, Native American tribes have struggled to explain why certain landscapes are sacred for them.\n\nIn 1988, just 10 years after the passage of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act, the Supreme Court considered a case involving the construction of a U.S. Forest Service road through undeveloped federal lands sacred to northern California tribes in the Six Rivers National Forest.\n\nThe lower court had ruled in favor of the Yurok, Karok and Tolowa tribes stating the road would impact their religious practice.\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court reversed the decision, ruling that building a road through a sacred landscape would not prohibit the tribes \"free exercise\" of religion.\n\nThe tribes lost, because the Supreme Court viewed the American Indian Religious Freedom Act as a policy and not a law with legal protections.\n\nUltimately, the road was not built because Congress stepped in and added this sacred area to the existing Siskiyou Wilderness, which is a protected area by federal law.\n\nWhat was noteworthy in the SCOTUS deliberations, though, was the dissenting opinion of Justice William Brennan, who defended land-based religions. He said,\n\n\"Native American faith is inextricably bound to the use of land. The site-specific nature of Indian religious practice derives from the Native American perception that land is itself a sacred, living being.\"\n\nIndeed, religion scholars such as Yale professor Tisa Wenger point out that \"the most important religious freedom issues for Native Americans\" center around protecting their sacred places.\n\nAt a time when the Trump administration has created a new task force to address discrimination against certain religious groups, the exclusion of Bears Ears and other places of religious significance from these discussions raises important questions about religious freedom in the United States and also the legacy of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act.\n\nRosalyn R.

      "text": "Newly found unmarked graves for Native children are a dark reminder of an ongoing legal battle\n\nYoung Hopi Indian girl standing outside, Oraibi, Arizona, ca.1900\n\nThis past month hundreds of unmarked graves of Native children have been found at two separate residential schools in Canada. Unfortunately, the United States has its own history with residential schools and removal of Native children, amounting to cultural genocide. These practices supported weakening the Native population and tribal sovereignty to serve US interests of stealing land from indigenous tribes. The discovery of these graves are a cruel reminder of the tragic treatment of Native-American children, which should remind us of the importance of the Indian Child Welfare Act, or ICWA, which is currently going through legal challenges.\n\nIn North America, missionaries often imposed religious education on Indigenous tribes in order to \"civilize\" Native people and enforce assimilation. One of the first laws passed in the United States to accomplish these goals was the Civilization Fund Act passed in 1819. The act encouraged and funded activities and education carried out by \"benevolent societies\" or religious organizations in order to \"civilize\" Native Americans. Not only did this act amount to forced cultural erasure, but it also supported the federal government funding religious groups and Christian education.\n\nThis act set the stage for the formation of federally supported residential Indian schools after the Bureau of Indian Affairs was created in 1824. In 1891, Congress passed a \" compulsory attendance \" law for residential schools. While the law was not strictly enforced, it did enable troops to come onto a reservation and forcibly take children away to enroll them in one of the boarding schools. The Commissioner of Indian Affairs was also authorized to use coercive practices, such as withholding rations, in order to force parents to send their children to the residential schools.\n\nWhen Hopi parents resisted the removal of children in 1894, troops not only rounded up 104 kids but also arrested 19 Hopi elders and sent them to Alcatraz for almost a year as punishment for resisting. In 1898, Congress passed another law that made attendance at school for Indian children mandatory, something that did not exist in every state for non-Indian children until 1912. By 1902, there were 25 residential schools off reservations in 15 states or territories. These amounted to forced assimilation and cultural genocide in their practices, which included requiring haircuts, uniforms, Christian religious services, and denial of indigenous languages and customs. Physical and sexual abuse were rampant and ignored. Enrollment grew throughout the 20th century, reaching a height of 350 residential schools by the 1970s.\n\nResidential schools were not the only method of Indian child-removal and cultural erasure. From 1958 to the early 1970s, the Indian Adoption Project removed thousands of Native kids from reservations and placed them in Christian homes. Child-welfare groups removed children from native homes for minor issues that never would have justified removal from white Christian homes. Minor hospital stays or even traditional religious practices were enough to justify removing native children from their families and tribes. Eighty-seven percent of Native children removed from their homes in this period were placed with non-Native families. As a result of residential schools and adoption, between 25-35 percent of Native children were removed from their homes.\n\nIn response to the disproportionately high rate of Indian child removal, Congress passed the Indian Child Welfare Act in 1978. ICWA gives Native American tribes exclusive jurisdiction over children who reside on an Indian reservation and presumptive jurisdiction over the foster care placement of Native children who do not live on reservations. ICWA prioritizes familial, tribal and cultural connection when considering tribal placement and requires active efforts to keep children with their families or tribes. While ICWA has helped stem the extreme removal of children, the lack of federal oversight has allowed noncompliance. Native parents are four times as likely to have their children removed and placed in foster care than white parents.\n\nWhile many in child welfare consider ICWA the \"gold standard\" in child welfare policy, it has faced, and continues to face, legal challenges . In 2013 ICWA reached the United States Supreme Court with Adoptive Couple v. Baby Girl . In it, a non-Native mother put her baby up for adoption after the Native father expressed interest in terminating his parental rights. However, after learning of the baby's adoption by a non-Native couple, the father sued under ICWA. The Court found that since the father was noncustodial, he did not necessarily have rights to sue under ICWA. While the decision ruled against the Native father, it did not overrule ICWA as a law. Unfortunately, it did inspire a number of legal challenges to the law by special interest groups as a result of Justice Alito's opinion, which analyzed the baby's connection to the Cherokee tribe through race rather than citizenship or political identity.\n\nThese challenges mostly failed until a coordinated attempt by the Goldwater Institute using an Equal Protection argument to challenge ICWA. The institute claims that ICWA is a race-based law that treats Native children differently from non-Native children based on their race. Claims that Indian law conflicts with the Equal Protection Clause date back to the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment. If successful could have far reaching implications for tribal sovereignty beyond ICWA.\n\nIn Morton v. Mancari in 1974, the Supreme Court ruled that a preference for Indians did not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment because such a preference was intended to correct discrimination, not cause it. The court argued that a preference for hiring Indians in governmental positions in the Bureau of Indian affairs gave \"Indians a greater participation in their own self-government; to further the Government's trust obligation toward the Indian tribes; and to reduce the negative effect of having non-Indians administer matters that affect Indian tribal life.\"\n\nAdditionally ICWA, and most Indian law, is based on tribal citizenship and sees Native American identity as a political one, not a racial one. Rebecca Nagle , citizen of the Cherokee Nation, has explained to me that, \"Anything that feeds this argument that Native identity is based on racial biology, rather than a political status as citizens of tribes, feeds this far-right attack on our tribes.\" She emphasized that Native Americans aren't a homogeneous group but instead tribes are separate sovereign nations.\n\nIn 2018, a federal district court in Texas struck down portions of ICWA in Brackeen v. Zinke . Judge Reed O'Connor sided with conservative arguments that ICWA violates the Equal Protection Clause and categorizes children by race, not eligibility for membership in a tribe. After initially overruling O'Connor, the Fifth Circuit agreed to hear the case, resulting in a mixed decision released in April 2021 upholding the law but overruling certain provisions. The Fifth Circuit found that the higher standard of requiring \"active\" versus \"reasonable\" efforts be made to keep the child with family to be unconstitutional as well as the requirement that child welfare agencies provide a \"qualified expert witness\" to justify placing a Native American child in foster care.\n\nWhile this recent opinion is mixed, it does not seem to justify the Equal Protection challenge or the claims that ICWA is a race-based law. Unfortunately if the case is further challenged and makes it to the Supreme Court, it's possible the entire law will be overturned and Native children will once again have no protection from removal."

      "text": "This Persistent Myth About Native Americans Needs Debunking\n\nThe following is an excerpt from the new book \"All the Real Indians Died Off\": And 20 Other Myths About Native Americans by Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz & Dina Gilio-Whitaker (Beacon Press, 2016):\n\nWhen they got off the boat they didn't recognize us. They said \" who are you?\" and we said \"we're the people, the human beings.\" \"Oh, Indians,\" [they said], because they didn't recognize what it meant to be a human being . . . but the predatory mentality shows up and starts calling us Indians and committing genocide against us as the vehicle of erasing the memory of being a human being. -John Trudell, in Reel Injuns\n\nWhen the first Europeans came to the shores of what is now the United States-what many descendants of the original inhabitants know as Turtle Island-they encountered enigmatic people who challenged everything the newcomers believed about themselves and the world. The Indigenous people looked different from them and spoke different languages, and their customs were mysterious and frightening. They inhabited a landscape that was entirely foreign and \"wild.\" Perhaps most disturbing, they were not Christians. But they had one thing the immigrants wanted: land and the life it could give them. In the subsequent five centuries since those early encounters, gaining access to that land has been the central factor that has shaped the relationships between Indigenous peoples and immigrant. Those relationships have never ceased to be vexed and conflict-ridden. They have been and continue to be characterized by seemingly endless ignorance, arrogance, and misunderstanding.\n\nWhere do the myths about Native people come from? What are the motives behind them and what purpose do they serve? To answer these questions we need to look at the ways experts in the social sciences talk about history, the nature of the society we live in, and how modern countries are formed. There is not unanimous agreement on everything, but there are certain generalities that can reasonably be claimed. For instance, some social scientists talk about the \"master narratives\" of a country that describe things like its national character and history. The narratives have many purposes, one of them being to construct a sense of national-or, more to the point, state-identity.  In countries like the United States, where citizens otherwise have very little in common with each other besides a shared language or a history of immigration, the narratives reinforce a contrived sense of unity. They reflect what acclaimed international relations scholar Benedict Anderson famously called an \"imagined community.\"\n\nFrom where do the master narratives come? They are woven into the fabric of society from the start in its founding documents (like the Declaration of Independence or the US Constitution), and then gain hold through the printed word, through the mass media, through the education system. They are amplified during times of national crisis and manifested through patriotic public displays during national holidays and through the singing of national anthems at sporting events and other public gatherings. As Anderson suggested, the effervescence generated in these public spaces is itself the outward expression of this imagined unity.\n\nA country's master narratives are not necessarily based in fact or truth. They are sometimes deliberately fictitious or contradictory of documented history. One of their purposes is to provide rationalization or justification for injustices committed against others in the name of democracy and liberty. In this way many master narratives are more like state mythologies, designed to undergird the patriotism and emotional commitment necessary in a loyal citizenry. All of the myths about American Indians emerge out of larger narratives that construct the United States as a place of exceptional righteousness, democracy, and divine guidance (manifest destiny), or what has been called \"American exceptionalism.\" The myths tell more about the non-Native mind than they tell about Native peoples. They are clues that point to the motivations, aspirations, and ambivalence about US history and the collective identity of its citizens.\n\nNo myth about Native people is as pervasive, pernicious, or self-serving as the myth of the vanishing Native, also known as \"the vanishing Indian\" or \"the vanishing race.\" The myth, which had been building for centuries, reached an extreme at the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century, a time when the Indian wars of resistance had come to a conclusion, punctuated by the massacre at Wounded Knee in 1890. In 1900 the US census counted approximately a quarter of a million Indians, a small fraction of the Indigenous population in 1492 (even based on a modest population estimate of ten million), and census figures such as this have been used to \"prove\" the vanishing Indian myth. It's true enough that the Native population had diminished dramatically throughout the centuries due to slavery, disease, war, and Christianization, which often took away people's names, languages, and even their clothing and hair. But the larger point to understand about the self-serving function of the myth is how it was used to advance dubious-even nefarious-political agendas aimed at the continual seizure of Indian lands and resources. It was used by both the \"friends\" and foes of Indians to justify policies of forced assimilation, which would mean the final solution to the \"Indian problem,\" the ultimate disappearance of Indians to facilitate the transfer of Indian treaty lands into settler ownership.\n\nOne reason the myth of the vanishing Native has been so pervasive is that it has been woven into history books by predominantly non-Native historians and researchers who have wittingly or unwittingly served political agendas. But there has been a marked shift in the way history is being told, thanks to the increasing scholarship of Native peoples and their allies who in the past forty to fifty years have been reframing conventional historical narratives. This reframing is often referred to generally as postcolonial theory (or postcolonial studies), and it views history from a larger perspective that, among other things, recognizes the role of imperial and state power-and its abuse-in the shaping of the modern world. It sees history in terms of post-Columbus European and US expansionism and the effects it had (and continues to have) on Indigenous people. It also encompasses Native perspectives by incorporating the growing academic field of Native American and international Indigenous studies. This recent scholarship, sometimes derisively called \"revisionist history,\" has rendered incomplete (if not obsolete) much of the earlier scholarship.\n\nWithin postcolonial studies is a theoretical framework known as \"settler colonialism.\" Viewing history through a lens of settler colonialism entails making distinctions between the ways colonization played out in different places, and it does this in two fundamental ways. First, when European empires (predominantly the English, Spanish, Dutch, Portuguese, and French) spread into Africa and Asia, they did so primarily to exploit natural resources such as gold, silver, other minerals, and timber. They established colonies as bases from which to run their business enterprises and sometimes, especially in the cases of the Spanish and the French, married into Indigenous cultures to secure better access to those resources. For the most part, however, they didn't send large populations from the metropoles (countries or empires of origin into the colonies to live. Thus, in the African and Asian colonial contexts, the Indigenous peoples remained the majority populations, even though they had become dominated through military power and religious conversion. This is why the decolonization movements in those continents during the mid-twentieth century were able to reestablish Indigenous control (however problematically in, for example, Africa) and expel the foreign powers. But in the Americas, and in a few other places, like Australia and New Zealand, the colonial powers engaged in wholesale population transfer, sending massive numbers of settlers to occupy the lands (resulting in new countries after successful rebellions separated colony from the empire). And they kept coming. As these settlers came to outnumber the Indigenous populations, it became impossible for the Indigenous people to expel the invaders.\n\nThe theory of settler colonialism has gained wide acceptance among Indigenous scholars in the United States and other settler states over the last decade. It postulates, as the Australian scholar Patrick Wolfe has written, that the singular goal of the settler state relative to Indigenous peoples is the elimination of the Native in order to gain access to land. The elimination of the Native can take place in a multitude of ways, including full-scale genocidal war, but it is usually more insidious than that. Not so much an overtly historical event, it becomes woven into the structure of settler society through practices that chip away at the very concept of \"Native.\" Examples of these practices include officially encouraged intermarriage, privatization of Indigenous lands, forced assimilation via social systems like boarding schools and other educational institutions and public schools in general, citizenship bestowal, child abduction and adoption, and religious conversion, to name just a few.\n\nThe myth of the vanishing Native can be traced precisely to the impulse of the state to eliminate the Native. It can be thought of as the central organizing myth from which most other popular myths about Native people arise. As the predominant myth, it is informed by the past and reaches into the present and future to continue challenging ideas about who American Indians are on a cultural level, which has ramifications at the legal level in determination of who is an Indian and who is not. It is a fully exclusionary project that limits \"Native\" as a category of racial and political identity. This is why deconstructing myths about American Indians is so important. At their core, the debates about Indianness are debates about authenticity. Authenticity is predicated upon specific dynamics that define \"real\" Indians. These are \"commonsense\" understandings that are built into society's dominant narratives, where certain assumptions are held to be unquestionably true. For example, real Indians are expected to look a certain way based on an appropriate minimum \"blood quantum.\" Or real Indians live on reservations, not in cities, and they embody the requisite appropriate blood quantum. These examples imply an impossible ideal about Indians as frozen in an unchanging past, where they are unable to be both modern and Indian.\n\nToday's Native studies scholarship tackles these deeply embedded stereotypes. In one study, Jeani O'Brien sought to understand how Indians were written out of New England history between 1820 and 1880, despite the fact that they continued to live in the region. Based on reading hundreds of local histories, she discovered a pattern in which Indians were not recognized as Indians (in part to justify the seizure of their lands) due to their intermarriage with non-Natives or because they lived as modern non-Native people did. O'Brien writes,\n\n\"This penchant for Indian purity as authenticity also found essential expression in the idea of the ancient: non-Indians refused to regard culture change as normative for Indian peoples. Thus, while Indians adapted to the changes wrought by colonialism by selectively embracing new ways and ideas, such transformations stretched beyond the imaginations of New Englanders: Indians could only be ancients, and refusal to behave as such rendered Indians inauthentic in their minds.\"\n\nO'Brien's work-as that of numerous other scholars-is to challenge the myths that equate blood purity and cultural stasis with Native authenticity. The myth of the vanishing Indian is entirely untrue, if for no other reason than because there are currently 567 federally recognized Native nations in the United States today and because, according to the 2010 US census, 5.2 million people identified as Native American or Alaska Native, either alone or in combination with other races. About 2.9 million people identified as Native American or Alaska Native alone.\n\n[[{\"type\":\"media\",\"view_mode\":\"media_large\",\"fid\":\"617105\",\"attributes\":{\"alt\":\"\",\"class\":\"media-image\",\"height\":\"480\",\"typeof\":\"foaf:Image\",\"width\":\"311\"}}]]\n\nExcerpted from \"All the Real Indians Died Off\": And 20 Other Myths About Native Americans by Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz and Dina Gilio-Whitaker (Beacon Press, 2016).

      "text": "How the first Pilgrims and Puritans differed in their views on religion and respect for Native Americans\n\nA sketch from 1877 illustrating the landing of the Pilgrims, by artist Albert Bobbett. The Print Collector/Hulton Archives via Getty Images Michael Carrafiello , Miami University\n\nEvery November, numerous articles recount the arrival of 17th-century English Pilgrims and Puritans and their quest for religious freedom.  Stories are told about the founding of Massachusetts Bay Colony and the celebration of the first Thanksgiving feast.\n\nIn the popular mind, the two groups are synonymous. In the story of the quintessential American holiday, they have become inseparable protagonists in the story of the origins.\n\nBut as a scholar of both English and American history, I know there are significant differences between the two groups. Nowhere is this more telling than in their respective religious beliefs and treatment of Native Americans.\n\nPilgrims arose from the English Puritan movement that originated in the 1570s. Puritans wanted the English Protestant Reformation to go further. They wished to rid the Church of England of \"popish\" - that is, Catholic - elements like bishops and kneeling at services .\n\nEach Puritan congregation made its own covenant with God and answered only to the Almighty. Puritans looked for evidence of a \" godly life ,\" meaning evidence of their own prosperous and virtuous lives that would assure them of eternal salvation. They saw worldly success as a sign, though not necessarily a guarantee, of eventual entrance into heaven.\n\nAfter 1605, some Puritans became what scholar Nathaniel Philbrick calls \" Puritans with a vengeance .\" They embraced \" extreme separatism ,\" removing themselves from England and its corrupt church.\n\nThese Puritans would soon become \" Pilgrims \" - literally meaning that they would be prepared to travel to distant lands to worship as they pleased .\n\nIn 1608, a group of 100 Pilgrims sailed to Leiden, Holland and became a separate church living and worshipping by themselves .\n\nThey were not satisfied in Leiden. Believing Holland also to be sinful and ungodly , they decided in 1620 to venture to the New World in a leaky vessel called the Mayflower. Fewer than 40 Pilgrims joined 65 nonbelievers, whom the Pilgrims dubbed \"strangers ,\" in making the arduous journey to what would be called Plymouth Colony.\n\nMost Americans know that more than half of the Mayflower's passengers died the first harsh winter of 1620-21 . The fragile colony survived only with the assistance of Native Americans - most famously Squanto . To commemorate, not celebrate, their survival, Pilgrims joined Native Americans in a grand meal during the autumn of 1621 .\n\nBut for the Pilgrims, what we today know as Thanksgiving was not a feast; rather, it was a spiritual devotion . Thanksgiving was a solemn and not a celebratory occasion. It was not a holiday.\n\nStill, Plymouth was dominated by the 65 strangers, who were largely disinterested in what Pilgrims saw as urgent questions of their own eternal salvation.\n\nThere were few Protestant clerics among the Pilgrims, and in few short years, they found themselves to be what historian Mark Peterson calls \" spiritual orphans .\" Lay Pilgrims like William Brewster conducted services, but they were unable to administer Puritan sacraments.\n\nAt the same time, Pilgrims did not actively seek the conversion of Native Americans . According to scholars like Philbrick, English author Rebecca Fraser and Peterson, the Pilgrims appreciated and respected the intellect and common humanity of Native Americans.\n\nAn early example of Pilgrim respect for the humanity of Native Americans came from the pen of Edward Winslow . Winslow was one of the chief Pilgrim founders of Plymouth. In 1622, just two years after the Pilgrims' arrival, he published in the mother country the first book about life in New England, \" Mourt's Relation .\"\n\nWhile opining that Native Americans \"are a people without any religion or knowledge of God,\" he nevertheless praised them for being \"very trusty, quick of apprehension, ripe witted, just.\"\n\nWinslow added that \"we have found the Indians very faithful in their covenant of peace with us; very loving. ... we often go to them, and they come to us; some of us have been fifty miles by land in the country with them.\"\n\nIn Winslow's second published book, \" Good Newes from New England (1624) ,\" he recounted at length nursing the Wampanoag leader Massasoit as he lay dying, even to the point of spoon-feeding him chicken broth. Fraser calls this episode \"very tender.\"\n\nThe thousands of non-Pilgrim Puritans who remained behind and struggled in England would not share Winslow's views. They were more concerned with what they saw as their own divine mission in America.\n\nAfter 1628, dominant Puritan ministers clashed openly with the English Church and, more ominously, with King Charles I and Bishop of London - later Archbishop of Canterbury - William Laud.\n\nSo, hundreds and then thousands of Puritans made the momentous decision to leave England behind and follow the tiny band of Pilgrims to America. These Puritans never considered themselves separatists, though. Following what they were confident would be the ultimate triumph of the Puritans who remained in the mother country, they would return to help govern England.\n\nThe American Puritans of the 1630s and beyond were more ardent, and nervous about salvation, than the Pilgrims of the 1620s. Puritans tightly regulated both church and society and demanded proof of godly status, meaning evidence of a prosperous and virtuous life leading to eternal salvation. They were also acutely aware of that divine-sent mission to the New World.\n\nPuritans believed they must seek out and convert Native Americans so as to \" raise them to godliness .\" Tens of thousands of Puritans therefore poured into Massachusetts Bay Colony in what became known as the \"Great Migration.\" By 1645, they already surrounded and would in time absorb the remnants of Plymouth Colony .\n\nDominated by hundreds of Puritan clergy, Massachusetts Bay Colony was all about emigration, expansion and evangelization during this period.\n\nAs early as 1651, Puritan evangelists like Thomas Mayhew had converted 199 Native Americans labeled by the Puritans as \" praying Indians .\"\n\nFor those Native Americans who converted to Christianity and prayed with the Puritans, there existed an uneasy harmony with Europeans . For those who resisted what the Puritans saw as \"God's mission,\" there was harsh treatment - and often death.\n\nBut even for those who succumbed to the Puritans' evangelization, their culture and destiny changed dramatically and unalterably .\n\nA devastating outcome of Puritan cultural dominance and prejudice was King Philip's War in 1675-76 . Massachusetts Bay Colony feared that Wampanoag chief Metacom - labeled by Puritans \"King Philip\" - planned to attack English settlements throughout New England in retaliation for the murder of \"praying Indian\" John Sassamon .\n\nThat suspicion mushroomed into a 14-month, all-out war between colonists and Native Americans over land, religion and control of the region's economy. The conflict would prove to be one of the bloodiest per capita in all of American history.\n\nBy September 1676, thousands of Native Americans had been killed , with hundreds of others sold into servitude and slavery. King Philip's War set an ominous precedent for Anglo-Native American relations throughout most of North America for centuries to come.\n\nSo, Puritans and Pilgrims came out of the same religious culture of 1570s England. They diverged in the early 1600s, but wound up 70 years later being one and the same in the New World.\n\nIn between, Pilgrim separatists sailed to Plymouth, survived a terrible first winter and convened a robust harvest-time meal with Native Americans. Traditionally, the Thanksgiving holiday calls to mind those first settlers' courage and tenacity.\n\nHowever, the humanity that Pilgrims like Edward Winslow showed toward the Native Americans they encountered was lamentably and tragically not shared by the Puritan colonists who followed them. Therefore, the ultimate legacy of Thanksgiving is and will remain mixed.\n\nMichael Carrafiello , Professor of History, Miami University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "text": "Audio emerges of Republican's racially charged tirade about 'drunk' Native Americans\n\nMontana Republican Tim Sheehy , who is running for the U.S. Senate against Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT), was recorded making racially charged and disparaging comments about Native Americans.\n\nChar-Koosta News , the official news publication of the Flathead Indian Reservation, revealed shocking audio of the Republican candidate during a November fundraiser.\n\nSheehy trashed his relationship with Crow Reservation tribal members, saying, \"a great way to bond with all the Indians while they're drunk at 8:00 A.M.\"\n\n\"We ranch together on the Crow res,\" he told the group. \"So, I'm pretty involved down there. Road through their annual Crow Fair this year. Um, and I've broken bread with them every year... so... Great way to bond with all the Indians while they're drunk at 8:00 A.M. and you're ropin' together.\"\n\nA number of male voices laugh.\n\nThe comments are remarkably similar to those he made during a Nov. 10 event in Hamilton, claiming he rode in the Cow Fair parade.\n\nHe claimed that one of the first things he did was strap a Sheehy sign to his horse and ride through the \"Crow Res parade.\"\n\n\"And if you know a tough crowd, go through the Crow parade,\" he said. \"Now, they'll let you know when they like you or not, if Coors Light cans flying by your head...

The gun then discharged in Montana's Glacier National Park, ultimately shooting himself, court records showed.\n\nSheehy also hired a staffer known for liking and sharing racist posts.\n\nListen to the clips here."

      "text": "Here are 13 recommended books about and by American Indians\n\nOver the years, one question I have been asked repeatedly is for a recommendation of a book that comprehensively tells the story of American Indians. In fact, there's no book that does that because, just like other people who live in the USA, Indians aren't monolithic. Hundreds of federally recognized tribes, hundreds more that are unrecognized, 29 language groups and 10 times that many languages, different traditions, different religions. It's Native American cultures, not culture singular. Our ancestors didn't all wear feathered headdresses or hunt bison on horseback. And they don't all own casinos or wish they did.\n\nThere are, however, many good books that can help readers of whatever age learn about ancestral and modern Natives (and the First Nations peoples of Canada). I have two bookcases filled and a few boxes as well, several hundred in all. What follows are brief takes on an eclectic baker's dozen of such books. At some levels, all these books are political, but that doesn't make them heavy-handed or preachy.\n\nBefore beginning, I want to strongly recommend the work of Debbie Reese, a Nambé Pueblo Indian woman who for years has done prodigious evaluation of books for kids about American Indians. She does so at American Indians in Children's Literature and speaks widely on the subject. I've learned a great deal from her critique of children's books about or featuring Indians, much of which applies to books written about Indians for adults. Some readers may be surprised not to see certain books on this list-for instance, Dee Brown's seminal Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee or Charles C. Mann's 1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus. Those and others have been left out not because they're bad-both those are excellent-but because they are so well-known and not written by Natives.\n\nCrossing Bok Chitto: A Choctaw Tale of Friendship & Freedom , by Tim Tingle (Choctaw) and illustrated by Jeanne Rorex Bridges (Cherokee). It's 1808 in this picture book for children ages 4-9, and Martha Tom, a young Choctaw, lives on the Indian side of the Bok Chitto River in Mississippi. On the other side are plantation owners and their slaves. Any slave who escapes the plantation to the other side of the river is free, and slave owners cannot by law cross to the other side. Martha goes picking blackberries one day and cannot stick to the rules her mother has laid down about never crossing the river. She does, meets a slave, and eventually leads seven slaves to the free side of the river. On the back cover, Tingle writes, \" Crossing Bok Chitto is a tribute to the Indians of every nation who aided the runaway people of bondage. Crossing Bok Chitto is an Indian book and documented the Indian way, told and told again and then passed on by uncles and grandmothers. In this new format, this book way of telling, Crossing Bok Chitto is for both the Indian and the non-Indian. We Indians need to know and embrace our past. Non-Indians should know the sweet and secret fire, as secret as the stones, that drives the Indian heart and keeps us so determined that our way, a way of respect for others and the land we live on , will prevail.\"\n\nRain is Not My Indian Name , by Cynthia Leitich Smith (Muscogee). This book for middle schoolers ages 10-14 explores the grief, conflicts, and epiphanies of a Muscogee/Cherokee/Scots-Irish girl, 14-year-old Cassidy Rain Berghoff, who lives in a mostly white Midwestern town. She's just emerged from six months of seclusion after her best friend was killed in a car accident. Having already lost her mother, she has plenty of emotional pain to ponder. She decides to return to the world and go to her Aunt Georgia's summer \"Indian Camp.\" Rather than immersing herself there, however, she keeps her distance by getting a job shooting photos of the camp for the local newspaper. When the town council considers cutting off funding for the camp, she becomes involved in ways she hadn't intended, which contributes to her healing. With humor and zero preachiness, Smith's poignant telling benefits from her technique of beginning chapters with short excerpts from Rain's journal.\n\nThe Plague of Doves , by Louise Erdrich (Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa). Erdrich is one of the leading lights of the second wave of the Native American Renaissance . Her poetry glows, and her prose is saturated with poetic imagery. Plague begins with the racist response after a white family is murdered in the early 20th century and four Indians, including a young boy, are hunted down and lynched while the real killer roams free. But Erdrich is not given to the simple and predictable. She brings to life a fictional town in western North Dakota far beyond those opening scenes. From the arrival of the first colonizers centuries ago, the interaction and interchange between them and Native peoples have been complex, contradictory, and filled with betrayal, tragedy, and abundant connection. Erdrich's superb tale weaves all that together with characters of fullness, some of them strange, some dedicated to trouble, none of them uninteresting.\n\nNavajo Long Walk , by author Joseph Bruchac (Nulhegan Abenaki) and illustrator Shonto Begay (Navajo). Ages 8-12. Most Americans have at least heard of the Trail of Tears, the forced removal across the Mississippi of the Cherokee and several other tribal peoples during the 1830s. This cost the lives of thousands of Indians. Few, however, have heard of the forced removal in the 1860s that the Navajo call the \"Long Walk.\" It's another instance of how the dominant culture has done so much to make Native Americans and much of our history invisible. Bruchac and Begay bring this shameful episode to life. Bruchac, who has written more than 40 fiction and nonfiction books for both children and adults, discusses how the Navajo were treated by the Spanish invaders, and how two-and-a-half centuries later they were forced by the U.S. government from their land onto a provisional reservation in New Mexico Territory, a 500-mile trek with severe hardships that included many deaths. Unlike the cases of most other tribes who lost their land, however, the reservation at Bosque Redondo was closed after a few years, and a treaty signed to allow the Navajo to return to their homeland, where they still live today.\n\nWe Are Grateful: Otsaliheliga , by author Traci Sorell (Cherokee) and Australian illustrator Frané Lessac. Sorell is a fine storyteller who combines modern concerns with a traditional Cherokee presentation in this nonfiction book that follows the story of Cherokee life and ceremonies for an entire year, demonstrating the lasting strength of the Cherokee way of life. This seasonal arrangement is both entertaining and educational. The new year begins in autumn, a time of basket-weaving and remembrances of The Trail of Tears, and ends in summer. Traditions continue to play a major part in modern Cherokee life, which includes stickball and stomp dancing at the Great New Moon Ceremony, as well as planting strawberries and making cornhusk dolls. There is a conscious attempt by Sorell to trample on stereotypes of indigenous people, and, among other things, we see a father in a positive parenting role and Cherokees of a variety of skin colors, dark and light, which gives force to the book's message of diversity. The book includes a complete syllabary invented by the Cherokee Sequoyah some two centuries ago and a glossary. One word there is otsaliheliga (oh-jah-LEE-hay-lee-gah). Sorell writes: \"Cherokee people say otsaliheliga to express gratitude. It is a reminder to celebrate our blessings and reflect on struggles-daily, throughout the year, and across the seasons.\"\n\nLike a Loaded Weapon: The Rehnquist Court, Indian Rights, and the History of Racism in America , by Robert A. Williams (Lumbee). This densely argued book by a noted professor of law and expert in Indian law, indigenous rights, and critical race theory at the University of Arizona's James E. Rogers College of Law is a bit of a tough read for nonlawyers. But it's worth the effort for those willing to make it. Williams explores the bases of modern court decisions affecting Native Americans, both legally via stare decisis and via the racist perspective found in the language of three 190-year-old rulings of the John Marshall Supreme Court, specifically Johnson v. McIntosh (1823) , Cherokee Nation v. Georgia (1831), and Worcester v. Georgia (1832). For Williams, the 21st century consequences of continuing to lean on these long-ago rulings from a time when the U.S. government was engaged in wars of conquest are, as Kristin Ackley wrote in a 2006 law journal review, \"that Indian rights will never be protected as long as the court continues to talk about Indians as if they are lawless savages.\" Rulings with roots in the conquerors' oh-so-convenient \"Doctrine of Discovery\"-essentially: We found it and that makes it ours-need to be reassessed, he writes. Challenging the impact of these rulings and the language therein is, according to Williams, a \"postcolonial approach to Indian law [that] asserts that the justices need to be directly confronted with the fact that a Supreme Court decision on Indian peoples' most important human rights is an action that ought to involve a great deal of serious thought, instead of unconscious racial stereotyping.\"\n\nThere, There , by Tommy Orange (Cheyenne/Arapaho). Taking the title from Gertrude Stein's famous statement about the loss of the rural Oakland, California, she once knew-\"There is no there there\"-Orange's novel follows the lives of a dozen Indians of various tribes living in Oakland as they prepare for a local powwow and navigate urban life, battling the problems affecting so many Native peoples, from alcoholism and unemployment to domestic abuse, and fundamental issues of identity in a world that for most of them is far different from that of their parents. Nearly 70% of American Indians don't live on reservations today, and those who don't, whether tribally enrolled or not, are often unique blends of mixed heritage, torn by internalized stereotypes and frequently eager to recapture lost traditions, culture, and language, but without a clear path for how to do so. Teenager Orvil Red Feather takes the 21st century route to such knowledge by pulling up Google to answer, \"What does it mean to be a real Indian?\" In the mirror, as he puts on the tribal regalia that he has found in a closet, he sees only \"a fake, a copy, a boy playing dress-up.\" Himself a straddler of two worlds, like so many Indians, Orange is the offspring of a Cheyenne father and white mother who clashed, then divorced, over Native spirituality and evangelical Christianity, Orange told a reviewer, \"I wanted to have my characters struggle in the way that I struggled, and the way that I see other native people struggle, with identity and with authenticity.\"\n\nAn Indigenous Peoples' History of the United States , by Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz. A prize-winning historian and longtime activist with the American Indian Movement whose mother was Native but never wanted to admit it, Ortiz has reframed the history of American Indians, taking the original concept from Howard Zinn's A People's History of the United States and challenging the still widespread view in school textbooks that Europeans arrived to find a mostly empty land populated by inferior beings living in a primeval wilderness. This overview of 400 years of indigenous history takes a bottom-up approach to the subject. At its heart, her book is about making visible what so many other books have sought to hide away or, all too often, flat-out deny-this being the genocidal nature of the policies imposed on the peoples who were already here when the colonists arrived. Using their own words, often to devastating effect, Ortiz quotes prominent politicians, generals, writers, religious ministers, and heroes among the Founding Fathers, including George Washington, the \"father of our country,\" who began his military career with a scorched-earth policy against Natives who refused to sell or surrender their land. In a letter to Major General John Sullivan, he wrote that he should \"lay waste all [Indian] settlements around ... that the country may not be merely overrun but destroyed ... [Y]ou will not by any means listen to any overture of peace before the total ruin of their settlements is effected. [...] When we have effectually chastised them we may then listen to peace and endeavour to draw further advantages from their fears. But even in this case great caution will be necessary to guard against the snares which their treachery may hold out-They must be explicit in their promises, give substantial pledges for their performance and execute their engagements with decision and dispatch. Hostages are the only kind of security to be depended on.\"\n\nEverything You Know About Indians is Wrong , by Paul Chaat Smith (Comanche/Choctaw). Although he is best known for his exceptional book on Native activism- Like a Hurricane: The Indian Movement from Alcatraz to Wounded Knee (written with Robert Allen Warrior, Osage)-Smith uses relentless humor as a mostly good-natured jab in Everything, and not just to needle non-Natives. \"Many Indian folks\" he writes, \"and our so-called friends in the Wannabe Tribe make a pretty good living dispensing jukebox spiritualism and environmental teachings\" that they describe as Native heritage. Smith has, since 2001, been associate curator for the National Museum of the American Indian , and a fellow curator, Lowery Stokes Sims of the Museum of Arts and Design, writes of the book: \"Through references to contemporary and popular touchstones he sweeps away generations of sentimentality, nostalgia and accommodation that mark the relationship of Indians to the mainstream. We may flinch at his analyses where there are no innocents, no villains, but we cannot hide. Smith pushes the 'minority experience' past victimhood and infantilization to self-agency and determination.\"\n\nBlue Horses Rush In, by Luci Tapahonso (Diné aka Navajo). Having grown up in a home where no English was spoken, Tapahonso ultimately became the first poet laureate of the Navajo Nation, and her elegant storytelling in both poems and prose demonstrates why. Her work was inspired by the stories she heard when she was young, wrapped in blankets and looking at the stars on summer evenings that were \"filled with quiet voices, dogs barking far away, the fire crackling, and often we could hear the faint drums and songs of a ceremony in the distance.\" Paraphrasing can't capturing her voice, so here's a short excerpt:\n\nThe Heartbeat of Wounded Knee: Native America from 1890 to the Present , by David Treuer (Ojibwe). For Frederick Jackson Turner (and the U.S. census), the American frontier ended in 1890, the year of the U.S. Army's slaughter of Lakota men, women, and children at Wounded Knee, South Dakota. Likewise, that year was seen as the end of the Indian wars and, in so many ways, the end of American Indians. David Treuer sees it differently, and he takes up where Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee ends. The story of Native America isn't over, he writes; Indians have not vanished, and, despite all the well-known problems, there is a thriving vitality among indigenous Americans in the 21st century. He has brought it all to life in this ample, beautifully written book that braids the lives of many individuals and tribes, including his own. Treuer writes that his book \"is adamantly, unashamedly, about Indian life rather than death. That we even have lives-that Indians have been living in, have been shaped by, and in turn have shaped the modern world-is news to most people. The usual story told about us-or rather about 'the Indian'-is one of diminution and death, beginning in untrammeled freedom and communion with the earth and ending on reservations, which are seen as nothing more than basin of perpetual suffering. [...] This book is written out of the simple fierce conviction that our cultures are not dead and our civilizations have not been destroyed. It is written with the understanding that our present tense is evolving as rapidly and creatively as everyone else's.\" He does that brilliantly, poignantly, with the fierceness of a warrior and the comprehensiveness of a scholar.\n\nBrave Are My People: Indian Heroes Not Forgotten , by Frank Waters (Cheyenne). Before he died in 1995, the author wrote more then 20 books, was nominated five times for the Nobel Prize in Literature, and turned his early experiences among the Utes, Navajo, Hopi, and Taos Pueblo into stunning stories, including his best-known, The Man Who Killed the Deer, a novel about Taos Pueblo still in print 75 years after it was first published. Brave Are My People takes its title from a speech that the Shawnee warrior-statesman Tecumseh gave to the Osage in 1800. It gives us 5- to 10-page flashes of the life stories of a selection of American Indian spiritual leaders from Deganawidah, the Huron known as \"Peacemaker,\" born before Columbus stumbled ashore, to Irataba, the Mohave peacemaker who lived 400 years later.\n\nNative American DNA: Tribal Belonging and the False Promise of Genetic Science , by Kim Tallbear (Sisseton Wahpeton Oyate). Native identity has long been complicated by government rules, non-Indian attitudes, tribal politics, and racial stereotyping based on appearance and skin tone. But for the past two decades or so, it's been made more difficult by the rise of DNA testing. People who have no cultural or linguistic or other traditional Native ties but may have heard some family lore about an alleged ancestral aunt or grandfather with Indian lineage in some unknown tribe take DNA tests because they believe genetics makes the Indian. In a scholarly but imminently readable scrutiny, Tallbear's densely interdisciplinary book dismantles that and the myth of race being the defining characteristic of who is and is not a Native. And she speculates on how past white definitions of who meets the criteria could now be reinforced by a focus on DNA that undermines both tribal identity and sovereignty.\n\n• • •\n\nA half-dozen other books may also be of interest:"

The U.S. government spends billions of dollars to control and retain water in this \" Great American desert ,\" as it was described in the early 19th century.\n\nGeologist John Wesley Powell , an early director of the U.S. Geological Survey, pointed out in an important 1878 government study that the defining characteristic of the Great Plains and the West was its lack of water. He attempted to promote land ownership that was based on watersheds, instead of dividing land into the rectangular lots still in use today.\n\nPowell also recommended that America adopt a new type of land development - one that worked with nature, so everyone had access to water.\n\nThe U.S. government, however, ignored Powell's ideas. Writing on this issue later, author Wallace Stegner , who was passionate about the West, commented ,\n\nThe Lakota, the Blackfeet and the other tribes understood how to live with nature. They knew it was best to live within the restrictions of the limited water supply of the Great Plains.\n\nWater as sacred place\n\nFor thousands of years, Native American tribes across the Great Plains developed their own methods of living with the natural world and its limited water supply. They learned both through observation and experiment, arguably a process quite similar to what we might call science today. They also learned from their religious ideas, passed on from generation to generation in the form of stories.\n\nI learned from my grandparents, both members of the Blackfeet tribe in Montana, about the sacredness of water. They shared that the Blackfeet believed in three separate realms of existence - the Earth, sky and water. The Blackfeet believed that humans, or \"Niitsitapi,\" and Earth beings, or \"Ksahkomitapi,\" lived in one realm; sky beings, or \"Spomitapi,\" lived in another realm; and underwater beings, or \"Soyiitapi,\" lived in yet another realm. The Blackfeet viewed all three worlds as sacred because within them lived the divine.\n\nThe water world, in particular, was held in special regard. The Blackfeet believed that in addition to the divine beings, about which they learned from their stories, there were divine animals, such as the beaver. The divine beaver, who could talk to humans, taught the Blackfeet their most important religious ceremony. The Blackfeet needed this ceremony to reaffirm their relationships with the three separate realms of reality.\n\nThe Soyiitapi, divine water beings, also instructed the Blackfeet to protect their home, the water world. The Blackfeet could not kill or eat anything living in water; they also could not disturb or pollute water.\n\nThe Blackfeet viewed water as a distinct place - a sacred place. It was the home of divine beings and divine animals who taught the Blackfeet religious rituals and moral restrictions on human behavior. It can, in fact, be compared to Mount Sinai of the Old Testament , which was viewed as \"holy ground\" and where God gave Moses the Ten Commandments.\n\nWater as life\n\nNative American tribes on the Great Plains knew something else about the relationship between themselves, the beaver and water. They learned through observation that beavers helped create an ecological oasis within a dry and arid landscape.\n\nAs Canadian anthropologist R. Grace Morgan hypothesized in her dissertation \" Beaver Ecology/Beaver Mythology ,\" the Blackfeet sanctified the beaver because they understood the natural science and ecology of beaver behavior.\n\nMorgan believed that the Blackfeet did not harm the beaver because beavers built dams on creeks and rivers. Such dams could produce enough of a diversion to create a pond of fresh clean water that allowed an oasis of plant life to grow and wildlife to flourish.\n\nBeaver ponds provided the Blackfeet with water for daily life. The ponds also attracted animals, which meant the Blackfeet did not have to travel long distances to hunt. The Blackfeet did not need to travel for plants used for medicine or food, as well.\n\nBeaver ponds were a win-win for all concerned in \"the Great American desert\" that modern ecologists and conservationists are beginning to study only now.\n\nFor the Blackfeet, Lakota and other tribes of the Great Plains, water was \"life.\" They understood what it meant to live in a dry arid place, which they expressed through their religion and within their ecological knowledge.\n\nRights of Mother Earth\n\nIndigenous people from around the world share these beliefs about the sacredness of water.\n\nThe government of New Zealand recently recognized the ancestral connection of the Maori people to their water. On March 15, the government passed the \"Te Awa Tupua Whanganui River Claims Settlement Bill,\" which provides \"personhood\" status to the Whanganui River, one of the largest rivers on the North Island of New Zealand. This river has come to be recognized as having \"all the rights, powers, duties, and liabilities of a legal person\" - something the Maori believed all along.\n\nMany other countries have come to view the natural world and water from a similar perspective. In Bolivia, for example, the government passed laws in 2010 and 2012 for the \" Law of the Rights of Mother Earth ,\" which were motivated by the belief that nature has legal rights. The Ecuadorian constitution in 2008 recognized the rights of \"Nature, or Pacha Mama,\" with \"respect for its existence,\" which included water.\n\nThe United States does not have such laws. This is why the Standing Rock Lakota have been demanding for almost a year a right to clean water - free from the threat of potential environmental harm and to protect its sacredness.\n\nThis article was originally published on The Conversation .

      "text": "'Harmful and hurtful': South Dakota city revolts against hotel owner who banned Native Americans\n\nA hotel owner in Rapid City, South Dakota, is facing significant blowback for a social media post in which she said that Native Americans no longer would be welcome at her business.\n\nOn Sunday, Connie Uhre, owner of the Grand Gateway Hotel, wrote in a since-deleted Facebook post, \"Due to the killing that took place at the Grand Gateway Hotel on March 19, 2022...we will no longer allow any Native American on property.\"\n\nTV station KNBN reports that police responded to a report of a disturbance at the hotel around 4:30 a.m. Saturday and were notified that a gun had been fired in one of the rooms. They discovered the victim, a male in his late teens, who was transported to the hospital with serious, life-threatening injuries. Despite Uhre's description of the incident as \"a killing,\" a spokesperson for the Rapid City Police Department said the victim is still alive.\n\nThe hotel owner wrote that she can \"not allow a Native American to enter our business including Cheers,\" adding she can't tell \"who is a bad Native or a good Native.\" Cheers is a sports lounge and casino on the hotel property.\n\nThe city's mayor, Steve Allender , shared Uhre's Facebook message on his Twitter feed. He told the Rapid City Journal on Monday that he felt he couldn't be silent on the issue after he saw the hotel owner's comments.\n\n\"I just felt that I couldn't be silent and pretend like this is just a harmless venting out of frustration,\" he said. \"This is an attack on not only the 12% of Rapid Citians who are Native American, but also the larger Native American population nationwide. So I sent the Tweet, on the road traveling today, as a bare minimum symbol of support to the Native American community.\"\n\nTribal, city, county, law enforcement leaders have also issued a joint statement which described the comments as \"wrong, harmful and hurtful not only to Native Americans but also to Rapid City citizens, businesses, and the community at large.\"\n\nBut the hotel is suffering more than just verbal rebukes. According to SDPB Radio , the entire staff at the hotel's bar has quit. \"I can't have that be a part of my life, that negativity. So I just don't want to be associated with that,\" explained former employee Red Elk Zephier. \"I didn't even think about the money or anything involved, I just, I can't have that in my life.\"\n\nMany residents also told SDPB Radio that they plan to boycott the establishment."

(AP) - Voter participation advocate Theresa Pasqual traverses Acoma Pueblo with a stack of sample ballots in her car and applications for absentee ballots, handing them out at every opportunity ahead of New Mexico's Tuesday primary.\n\nResidents of the tribal community's original mesa-top \"sky city\" that endured after the Spanish invasion in the late 1500s know firsthand the challenges voters have faced across Indian Country, where polling places are often hours away and restrictive voter laws and ID requirements only add to the barriers .\n\nIt's been a century now since an act of Congress granted citizenship to Native Americans, but advocates say that right bestowed in 1924 still hasn't translated into equal access to the ballot. Inequities are especially pronounced in remote regions across the U.S., and some key Southwestern states with large Native American populations.\n\nNew Mexico is trying something new - a test run of sorts for many new and contested provisions that are part of the state's Native American Voting Rights Act that was passed last year. The measure promises tribal communities a greater voice in how and where they can vote, even opening the possibility that tribal offices can be designated as a street address for remote households that have none.\n\nThis should help at Acoma, where Pasqual said some residents still do not have standard addresses.\n\nNative Americans in New Mexico - home to 22 federally recognized tribal communities and holdings of an Oklahoma-based tribe - were among the last to gain access to voting, decades after the U.S. extended birthright citizenship to the land's original inhabitants on June 2, 1924 through the Indian Citizenship Act.\n\nThat legislation took shape in the aftermath of World War I in which thousands of Native Americans had volunteered to serve overseas in the military.\n\nA patchwork of statutes and treaties already offered about two-thirds of Native Americans citizenship, sometimes in exchange for land allotments that fractured reservations, gestures of assimilation, military service and even the renunciation of tribal traditions. The one-sentence Indian Citizenship Act swept away those requirements in an attempt to grant citizenship to all Native Americans.\n\nAt the same time, Congress deferred to state governments qualifications on who qualified to vote. Legal access to the ballot was denied under existing state constitutional provisions and statutes until 1948 in Arizona and New Mexico - and until 1957 on reservations in Utah.\n\nIt was by design, said Maurice Crandall, an Arizona State University history professor and citizen of the Yavapai-Apache Nation of Camp Verde. Pointing to the largest Native populations in New Mexico and Arizona, he said: \" They don't want a large group of Native people who can swing elections.\"\n\nFast forward to 2020, he said, and \"many people credit the Native vote with deciding to bring Arizona into the (Joe) Biden camp.\"\n\nBiden won Arizona by about 10,500 votes, as voter turnout surged on the Navajo and Hopi reservations.\n\nAt Laguna Pueblo in New Mexico, voting has provided Native Americans with a path to power amid the political rise of pueblo member Deb Haaland . She became one of the first two Native American women in Congress in 2018 before taking the reins of the Interior Department to oversee U.S. obligations to 574 federally recognized tribes.\n\nFor the upcoming primary, Laguna is on the front lines of two Democratic contests with first-time female Native American candidates competing in districts that were redrawn in 2021 to increase Native influence. In the general election, eligible voters among 8,000 Laguna residents will cast ballots in a congressional swing district rematch between U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez and Republican Yvette Herrell, who lost in 2022 by 1,350 votes. Herrell seldom invokes her Cherokee heritage.\n\nThe state's new voting rights legislation for Native Americans provides new tools for tribal communities to request convenient on-reservation voting sites and secure ballot deposit boxes with consultation requirements for county clerks and an appeals process.\n\nBut there are still obstacles, said Laguna Pueblo administrator Ashley M. Sarracino, pointing to tensions with county election administrators over a decision to withdraw three Election Day voting sites at the pueblo this year, leaving three open.\n\nIn Arizona, the anniversary of the Indian Citizenship Act stirs up frustration among Native American leaders, including Gov. Stephen Lewis of the Gila River Indian Community. He has denounced efforts by the Republican National Committee and state lawmakers to revive and extend voter ID requirements through the 2024 general election.\n\nTwo of Lewis' community members sued in 1928 after being turned away from the polls, only to have the Arizona Supreme Court rebuff their case. The community wouldn't realize the right to vote until 1948 - after World War II and the raising of an American flag at Iwo Jima that included Ira Hayes , who was part of the Gila River community.\n\nLewis during a recent online forum counted the years that passed between the time the U.S. Declaration of Independence was inked and the Indian Citizenship Act was signed. He said elected officials for years have \"made laws for us, about us, but never with us.\"\n\nNative Americans have held widely divergent views about citizenship and voting, said Torey Dolan, a research fellow at the University of Wisconsin Law School and citizen of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma. Some view U.S. citizenship as incompatible with being Indigenous people; others see it more like dual citizenship.\n\nWith approval of the citizenship act, many Native Americans feared the expansion of U.S. citizenship might undermine the special status of trust land that allows tribes to make their own decisions about tax-exempt land and shield it from speculators.\n\n\"It was really seen in many parts of Indian Country as being aimed at breaking down tribal cultures, particularly in the Southwest,\" said Geoffrey Blackwell, general counsel to the National Congress of American Indians that advocates for Native American rights and sovereignty.\n\nFor some, ensuring voting rights was worth the fight. In 1948, Isleta Pueblo member and World War II military veteran Miguel Trujillo challenged the status quo that barred Native Americans in New Mexico from voting by attempting to vote in Valencia County. He was rejected, sparking a landmark lawsuit that was supported by Washington-based federal Indian law pioneer Felix Cohen and the National Congress of American Indians.\n\nA 1956 federal survey of Native voting in the Southwest found anemic participation, with no polling places set up at New Mexico pueblos. In Arizona, Jim Crow-style discrimination set in with widespread application of literacy tests to block Native-language speakers from voting until the practice was barred in 1970 under the federal Voting Rights Act.\n\nThe Voting Rights Act of 1965 spurred a new movement within tribal communities to encourage participation, said Laura Harris, the Albuquerque-based director of Americans for Indian Opportunity and a citizen of the Comanche Nation of Oklahoma.\n\nIn 2013, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act that gave the Justice Department election oversight in states with a history of discrimination. Since then, several states have enacted new voting laws that some legal experts say make it unreasonably difficult for Native Americans to vote, including a flurry of restrictions from Republicans enacted in the wake of the 2020 election.\n\nBut in New Mexico, the Sandoval County clerk's office has expanded early voting services in recent years for tribal communities. Only one pueblo in the county declined the opportunity this year. Native language interpreters are posted at each of the sites, which are open to all county residents.\n\nEvelyn Sandoval works with the county attorney's office as a liaison to Native Americans. She teaches families how to use newly available tools to register online and receive absentee ballots by mail.\n\n\"I'm trying to get them to be self-reliant,\" said Sandoval, a 54-year-old former oil and gas company worker who was raised Ojo Encino, a Navajo community with fewer than 300 residents. Her mother spoke only Navajo.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Susan Montoya Bryan contributed to this story from Zia Pueblo, New Mexico.

(AP Photo/Rodrigo Abd)\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY, Okla. (AP) - A new study has found that systemic barriers to voting on tribal lands contribute to substantial disparities in Native American turnout, particularly for presidential elections.\n\nThe study, released Tuesday by the Brennan Center for Justice, looked at 21 states with federally recognized tribal lands that have a population of at least 5,000 and where more than 20% of residents identify as American Indian or Alaska Native. Researchers found that between 2012 and 2022, voter participation in federal elections was 7 percentage points lower in midterms and 15 percentage points lower in presidential elections than among those living off tribal lands in the same states.\n\nEarlier studies show voter turnout for communities of color is higher in areas where their ethnic group is the majority, but the latest research found that turnout was the lowest on tribal lands that have a high concentration of Native Americans, the Brennan Center said.\n\n\"There's something more intensely happening in Native American communities on tribal land,\" said Chelsea Jones, a researcher on the study.\n\nJones said the study suggests some barriers may be insurmountable in predominately Native communities due to a lack of adequate polling places or access to early and mail-in ballots. Many residents on tribal lands have nontraditional addresses, meaning they don't have street names or house numbers, making mail-in voting even more difficult. As a result, many Native American voters rely on P.O. boxes, but the study notes that several jurisdictions will not mail ballots to P.O. boxes.\n\nLong distances to the polls that do exist on tribal lands and little to no public transportation creates additional hurdles for Native American voters. In far-flung Alaska Native villages, polling places sometimes simply don't open if there's no one available to run an election, and severe weather can make absentee voting unreliable, The Associated Press reported last month.\n\n\"When you think about people who live on tribal lands having to go 30, 60, 100 miles (up to 160 kilometers) to cast a ballot, that is an extremely limiting predicament to be in,\" Jones said. \"These are really, truly severe barriers.\"\n\nAdditionally, Jones said they found Native American voters were denied the ability to vote using their tribal IDs in several places, including in states where that is legally allowed. All of these roadblocks to the ballot can create a sense of distrust in the system, which could contribute to lower turnout, Jones said.\n\nThe Brennan Center study also highlights on ongoing issue when it comes to understanding how or why Native Americans vote: a lack of good data.\n\n\"There are immense data inequities when it comes to studying Native American communities, especially as it pertains to politics,\" Jones said.\n\nNative American communities are often overlooked when it comes to polling data and sometimes when they are included those studies do not reflect broader trends for Indigenous voters, said Stephanie Fryberg, the director of the Research for Indigenous Social Action & Equity Center, which studies systemic inequalities faced by Indigenous people.\n\n\"Generally speaking, polling is not well positioned to do a good job for Indian Country,\" said Fryberg, who is also a professor of psychology at Northwestern University. \"There are ideas that are held up as the gold standard about how polling works that don't work for Indian Country because of where we live, because of how difficult it is to connect to people in our community.\"\n\nFryberg, a member of the Tulalip Tribes in Washington state, was one of several Indigenous researchers who denounced a recent exit poll conducted by Edison Research that found 65% of Native American voters who participated said they voted for Donald Trump. The poll only surveyed 229 self-identified Native Americans, a sample size that she said is too small for an accurate reading, and none of the jurisdictions in the poll were on tribal lands.\n\n\"Right there, you're already eliminating a powerful perspective,\" Fryberg said.\n\nThe Indigenous Journalists Association labelled that polling data as \"highly misleading and irresponsible,\" saying it has led \"to widespread misinformation.\"\n\nIn a statement to the Associated Press, Edison Research acknowledged that the polling size is small, but said the \"goal of the survey is to represent the national electorate and to have enough data to also examine large demographic and geographic subgroups.\" The survey has a potential sampling margin of error of plus or minus 9%, according to the statement.\n\n\"Based on all of these factors, this data point from our survey should not be taken as a definitive word on the American Indian vote,\" the statement reads.\n\nNative Americans are not just part of an ethnic group, they also have political identities that come with being citizens of sovereign nations. Fryberg said allowing those surveyed to self-identify as Native Americans, without follow-up questions about tribal membership and specific Indigenous populations, means that data cannot accurately capture voting trends for those communities.\n\nBoth Fryberg and Jones said that in order to create better data on and opportunities for Native Americans to vote, researchers and lawmakers would have to meet the specific needs of Indigenous communities. Jones said passage of the Native American Voting Rights Act, a bill that has stalled in Congress, would ensure equitable in-person voting options in every precinct on tribal lands.\n\n\"This is not an issue that we see across the country,\" Jones said. \"It's very specific to tribal lands. So we need provisions that address that uniquely.\"\n\n___\n\nThis story has been updated to correct the name of the Tulalip Tribes.\n\n___\n\nGraham Lee Brewer is an Oklahoma City-based member of the AP's Race and Ethnicity team.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP) - U.S. bishops on Friday approved new guidelines for ministering to Indigenous Catholics, a long in-the-works effort to reinvigorate the ministry and assure those communities that they don't need to feel torn between their Native identity and their Catholic one.\n\n\"You are both. Your cultural embodiment of the faith is a gift to the Church,\" states the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' document . It was completed as new details emerged during the past two years of widespread abuses inflicted on Native children over many decades at Catholic-run boarding schools .\n\n\"The Church recognizes that it has played a part in traumas experienced by Native children,\" according to the new \"Keeping Christ's Sacred Promise: A Pastoral Framework for Indigenous Ministry.\" The document received overwhelming support at this week's USCCB meeting in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nIt is meant to help bishops \"refocus and invigorate ministry among Indigenous populations in the United States,\" said Bishop Chad Zielinski, chair of the USCCB's subcommittee on Native American Affairs, who presented the draft framework on Thursday afternoon.\n\nIt \"gives shape to ideas that Catholic Native leadership has been voicing for the past several years in listening sessions sponsored by the subcommittee,\" he said.\n\nThe document, created with input from Native Catholics, is not meant to be an exhaustive, one-size-fits-all directive on ministering to the diverse array of Indigenous Catholics. Rather, it is guidance that can be adapted by dioceses, clergy and lay people to fit within the various cultural contexts of the people they are serving. It covers everything from evangelism and sacred music to boarding schools and marriage and family.\n\nNative Americans make up about 3.5% of U.S. Catholics and more than 350 parishes serve predominantly Indigenous people, according to USCCB statistics .\n\nThrough praying, listening and seeking healing and reconciliation, the bishops are committing to revitalizing their Native Catholic ministry.\n\nIt is a relationship that has been strained by the Catholic Church's involvement in past traumas that affected Native people, including operating at least 80 of the more than 500 government-funded Indigenous boarding schools in 19th and 20th centuries. The schools were part of a federal forced-assimilation program that ripped children from their families and suppressed their culture.\n\nThe document acknowledges the church's role, and offers an apology for failing to care well for Indigenous Catholics who have felt abandoned because church leaders ignored their unique cultural needs.\n\n\"Healing and reconciliation can only take place when the Church acknowledges the wounds perpetrated on her Indigenous children and humbly listens as they voice their experiences,\" the document states, and adds that those efforts should be led by Indigenous communities.\n\nThe majority of the boarding schools were run by the government, but Protestant and Catholic churches operated many of them.\n\nConditions varied at the schools, which some former students described as unsafe, unsanitary and scenes of physical or sexual abuse. Other former students recall their school years as positive times of learning, friendship and extracurricular activities. Indigenous groups note that even the better schools were part of a project to assimilate children - what many Indigenous groups call a cultural genocide.\n\n\"Fostering dialogue and engaging in other efforts to reconcile involvement remains an important priority of the USCCB on the issue of boarding school accountability as we walk with the impacted communities in their path towards healing,\" said USCCB spokesperson Chieko Noguchi.\n\nA recent Washington Post report found sexual abuse of Native children by clergy was pervasive at 22 Catholic-run boarding schools in the U.S. At least 122 priests, sisters and brothers were accused of sexually abusing the children in their care. The USCCB worked with the outlet's reporters, Noguchi said, \"because we agree that this painful story needs to be told. This story is part of the ongoing process to learn what happened and better understand how we can work toward healing.\"\n\nBasil Brave Heart, an Oglala Lakota boarding school survivor from the Pine Ridge reservation in South Dakota, said any pastoral plan needs to draw on the wisdom found in Indigenous spirituality and languages.\n\n\"If they're going to do that, I think they need a lot of communication with Native Americans,\" he said.\n\nHe has spoken out about his experiences as a boarding school student at Holy Rosary Mission in Pine Ridge, where he said he was forbidden from speaking his native language and had his long hair, considered sacred, cut shot. He currently partakes in Lakota spiritual practices while also attending Catholic Mass.\n\nHe said Catholic churches on the reservation are often empty and that if the church wants \"to keep the Native people in the congregation, I don't have the answer, but one of the things they need to do is change the liturgy.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press reporter Peter Smith, in Pittsburgh, contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP's collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

(AP) - Felix Ashley's red Toyota sends a plume of dust billowing along the sloping hills and boulders he traverses hours every week to pump water - the same roadway voters walk miles every four years to cast their ballots in presidential elections.\n\nHere on this forgotten swath of the Navajo Nation , the largest Native American reservation in the United States, hardship is embedded into day-to-day life.\n\nNearly a third of homes like Ashley's still don't have running water. Soaring unemployment and poverty has pushed young Navajos, including most of Ashley's children, to leave their sacred lands in search of jobs. Logistical and legal obstacles have long stood in the way of Arizona's 420,000 Native citizens casting their vote.\n\n\"People lose trust in the government and they don't - you don't - care to vote anymore.

(AP Photo/Rodrigo Abd)\n\nYet it is Native voters like him who could be key to winning Arizona and some of the most contested swing states in November. In 2020, Arizona voted for a Democratic president for the first time in decades, with President Joe Biden winning the race by around 10,500 votes.\n\nNative Americans - who make up 5.2% of Arizona- saw a surge in turnout, voting in large numbers for the Democratic Party, according to a data analysis by the Associated Press.\n\nThe victory turned the heads of politicians from both parties, who now flock to some of the most remote swaths of Arizona as they try to close razor thin margins. Democrats are hoping to repeat the feat, while Republicans see an opportunity to use Native voters' frustration with the economy as a chance to sweep up new votes.\n\n\"The Native vote has power, because they're able to decide the next presidential election. Everybody knows that it's going to come down to 15,000 or so votes in Arizona,\" said Jacqueline De León, a voting rights attorney with the Native American Rights Fund and member of the Isleta Pueblo.\n\nOne Senate candidate hiked down the wall of the northern Havasu Canyon to a tribe accessible only by helicopter, mule or hours-long treks to win over votes.

(AP Photo/Rodrigo Abd)\n\nThe feeling of being forgotten is one that has long simmered among the 22 federally recognized tribes across Arizona, from rock homes pressed on the edge of high plateaus of the Hopi reservation, to the barren plains where Ashley pumps water to his family.\n\nDozens of people who spoke to the AP in the final weeks before the election expressed frustration with Democratic-leaning tribal governments, as bureaucracy and corruption scandals tie up the most basic development efforts, and politicians in Washington, who they say rarely use their seat at the table to push for them.\n\nThat was the feeling for Ashley, a Democrat, as he pumped water into a tank in the back of his truck.

(AP Photo/Rodrigo Abd)\n\n\"You are always promised jobs, you're promised running water,\" he said. \"But there is nothing out here.\"\n\nAt the same time, some voters face almost insurmountable obstacles to voting.\n\nSome tribes have to travel up to 285 miles to cast their ballots, according to the Native American Rights Fund. Homes on many reservations don't have addresses needed to register to vote, so members of grassroots organizations walk door-to-door, helping people to register by tracking their geolocation and pinpointing it on a map. Some older Navajos don't speak much English, and organizers provide them detailed information in their native tongue.\n\nNavajo Kathleen Begay places a crown on her daughter as they prepare to take part in a \"Get out the vote\" or GOTV march in a push for Native Americans to vote in the upcoming presidential election on the Navajo Nation in Fort Defiance, Arizona, Oct. 12, 2024. (AP Photo/Rodrigo Abd)\n\n\"We go the extra mile. This is out in the middle of nowhere almost, and this is where people are not being reached,\" said 45-year-old Navajo Lacosta Johnson, a volunteer at the non-partisan group Arizona Native Vote, who drove hours one Saturday night to the outskirts of the reservation to mobilize voters.\n\nCompounding logistical hurdles is historic voter suppression and abuses of Native communities. Native people were first recognized as U.S. citizens 100 years ago, but Arizona prevented them from voting until 1948, arguing they were \"incompetent.\" Many states used English literacy tests to further block voters from casting ballots until the 1970s.\n\nStorm clouds form on Highway 264, on the Navajo Nation, on the outskirts of Tuba City, Ariz., Oct. 18, 2024.(AP Photo/Rodrigo Abd)\n\nSince then, legal experts say a mix of voter dilution tactics and burdensome election laws have blocked the Native vote, as recently as 2022. That's when the Republican-controlled Arizona Legislature and then-GOP governor passed a law requiring voters to provide proof of residency and an address for presidential voting.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court later struck down the measure, but Native communities have seen thousands of ballots thrown out in past elections due to similar statutes. Native voters have their ballots rejected at higher rates than other demographics in the state, according to Arizona State University's Indian Legal Clinic.\n\nThe result: People are highly skeptical of promises made year after year but never fulfilled.\n\n\"These incredibly slim margins mean that cutting off a community of a thousand voters has a huge substantive impact,\" said De León, the attorney. \"Right now, many Native Americans don't have their full rights of citizenship because it's just too hard to vote.\"\n\nDemocrats have long claimed an advantage in number of votes on reservations like the Navajo Nation. They've boasted a heavy presence on Native lands. In the final weeks of the election, Harris met with Native American youth in Arizona, telling them in a campaign video, \"your voice is your vote, and your vote is your power.\" President Joe Biden and vice presidential hopeful Tim Walz also paid visits last week to reservations in Arizona .\n\n\"Time and time again, Donald Trump had to do what was right for Indian Country and he chose the opposite,\" Walz said, promising to work for Native voters.\n\nBut they now face a strong campaign push by Republicans among Native voters in an attempt to peel off votes.\n\nThe Republican Party has opened its first campaign headquarters on the Navajo Nation, said Halee Dobbins, Arizona communications director of the Republican National Committee, and started to set up in local fairs long frequented by Democratic organizers.\n\n\"In 2020, we lost the election by 10,000 votes and we've seen that there is such a stronghold of the Native American vote by Democrats for decades, essentially,\" Dobbins said. \"We're seeing a huge shift towards the Republican party given the issues that are top of mind for Native American voters - the economy, inflation, cost of living.\"\n\nDozens of Native voters from across the state who spoke to the AP echoed Dobbins in ranking inflation and the economy as their top priorities, though most leaned Democratic or asked why they would bother to vote.\n\nIn mid-October, Trump's campaign invited a group of Navajo supporters like 61-year-old Francine Bradley-Arthur to sit behind him during a rally, where Trump gave a shout out to a conservative tribal leader.\n\nNavajo Francine Bradley-Arthur poses for a photo in front of Freedom House, a grassroots pro-Trump campaign house she founded on the Navajo Nation in Window Rock, Ariz., Oct 11, 2024. (AP Photo/Rodrigo Abd)\n\nBradley-Arthur, a former Democrat, said she began to campaign for Trump, in part, because she felt Native communities often didn't feel the payoff of longtime support for Democrats. It's a sentiment shared by Latino, Black and other minority voters across the U.S., causing a moment of reckoning for the party.\n\n\"We got up at 5 o'clock this morning to drive down here. We want to show that Native Americans support him,\" she said, among roaring crowds of Trump supporters.\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic Senate candidate Ruben Gallego went as far as to trek hours down a canyon to meet with one of the most remote tribes in North America in the weeks before the election, where he's locked in a tight race against Republican Kari Lake, who has promoted false claims that Trump won the 2020 election in Arizona.\n\nHe hoped to connect with voters in the Havasupai reservation, which has only 156 registered voters, to fulfill a campaign pledge to visit all the Native American tribes in Arizona. The tribe is so rural that election authorities helicopter ballots and election supplies in and out of the canyon.\n\nGallego said he's heard criticism that politicians only visit bigger and more accessible tribes, and that few in Washington know how to work with tribes to provide aid. Lake, his competitor, has also made campaign appearances on the Navajo Nation.\n\n\"They do feel like they're left behind. And a lot of it is because there's been negligence by both parties,\" Gallego told The Associated Press. \"We just can't take advantage of the vote. We assume that, you know, the same amount of people will come out every year. And that's not actually the case.\"\n\nSpeaking with Democratic-leaning Havasupai voters about their fight against a uranium mine they warn could poison their waters, Gallego was met with skepticism from some like Dinolene Caska, a tribal leader.\n\n\"For me, it's whoever is going to support Indigenous issues. It's not just Republicans or Democrats,\" Caska said. This year she planned to vote for Democrats because Democratic lawmakers have backed the tribe in the fight.\n\nMany other Navajo voters will also stick with the Democrats this year. Ashley, the Marine still plans to vote for Harris, just as he voted for Biden four years ago.\n\nFor Ashley, the deciding factor for this election was the fight for water rights, long championed by Democratic members of Congress, and social spending he hoped would trickle down to them. He and his family have wrinkled their noses at racist comments made by Trump during the campaign, seeing it as a sign that Republicans don't have minority interests at heart.\n\nBut for other Navajo, this is the year they are willing to try something new.\n\nJust down the road from Ashley, 68-year-old goat herder Richard Begay awakes at 6 a.m. sharp, flips on conservative radio and sips coffee out of a mug reading \"TRUMP. Best President Ever\" as the sun rises over his small wooden home.\n\nBegay's fierce loyalty to the Republican Party rests largely in the economy.\n\nHe blames Biden for inflation disproportionately affecting Native Americans because of the scarcity of jobs in their communities, which forced him and other family members to leave the reservation for many years. The prices of gas and food for his animals have squeezed his pocketbook.\n\n\"I remember gas was $1.60 here and when Biden came and went up over $3,\" he said. \"We don't have the money to buy gas at outrageous prices. We pay more for less.\"\n\nHe hopes Trump's push for deregulation could usher in new economic opportunities on his reservation, citing the contentious construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline along tribal lands as a key example. Maybe then, young people would see more of a future in Dilkon. He believes under a Trump presidency, development would increase, which would bring some optimism.\n\nBut for now, he guides his goats along the rugged mountains, little changed over the course of generations his family has dwelled there.\n\nEven with his hope for change, he voiced a sentiment that unites both Republican and Democratic-leaning voters on reservations across the state.\n\n\"We're being used.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP) - Tribal leaders in Montana urged Republican U.S. Senate candidate Tim Sheehy to apologize over remarks he made to supporters about Native Americans being \"drunk at 8 a.m.\" and throwing beer cans at him on the Crow Reservation\n\nAudio recordings of Sheehy's derogatory comments were obtained and published by Char-Koosta News , the official publication of the Flathead Indian Reservation.\n\nSheehy is backed by former President Donald Trump as he challenges three-term incumbent Democratic Sen. Jon Tester in one of the most closely-watched congressional races in the nation.\n\nA Republican victory could help swing control of the closely divided Senate.\n\nSheehy is heard commenting in one of the recordings that his ranching partner is a member of the Crow Tribe with whom Sheehy ropes and brands cattle on the tribe's southeastern Montana reservation.\n\n\"Great way to bond with all the Indians, to be out there while they're drunk at 8 a.m.,\" Sheehy says.\n\nIn another recording, he describes riding a horse in the parade at Crow Fair, an annual gathering in Crow Agency that includes powwows, a rodeo and other events.\n\n\"If you know a tough crowd, you want to go to the Crow res,\" Sheehy says. \"They let you know whether they like you or not - there's Coors Light cans flying by your head riding by.\"\n\nThe Rocky Mountain Tribal Leaders Council, which represents 11 tribes and First Nations in the western U.S. and Canada, said Sheehy's comments perpetuated stereotypes about Native Americans.\n\nCouncil Chairman Bryce Kirk asked Sheehy to apologize in a Tuesday letter to the campaign obtained by The Associated Press.\n\n\"You ask for our votes and then you go to your fundraiser, ironically with alcohol flowing and laughter at our expense behind closed doors, and you insult us with a stereotype that only seeks to severely diminish and dishonor our people,\" Kirk wrote. \"The Crow people are not your punchline. Native Americans are not your punchline.\"\n\nIt's uncertain if Sheehy's comments will still be on voters' minds when they start casting ballots. But political analyst Paul Pope said their \"unseemly\" nature could spur more Native Americans to register to vote, which could boost Tester.\n\n\"Maybe there's some fence-sitters out there and this might be a tipping point for them,\" added Pope, a professor at Montana State University Billings.\n\nA Sheehy campaign spokesperson did not dispute the authenticity of the recordings, which the tribal newspaper said came from fundraising events held in Montana last November.\n\nSheehy is a former U.S. Navy SEAL with no previous political experience who moved to Montana a decade ago and founded an aerial firefighting company. He knows members of the Crow Tribe and visits the reservation to work cattle with them, said spokesperson Jack O'Brien.\n\n\"He works with them, he brands with them,\" O'Brien said. \"What folks are insinuating about him, that's just not who he is.\"\n\nHe did not say if Sheehy would apologize or otherwise respond to the tribal leaders' request.\n\nMontana has seven Indian reservations and almost 70,000 Native Americans, representing about 7% of its total population, according to U.S. Census data. It's a voting block that's long been considered Democratic-leaning, but Montana Republicans in recent years have courted tribal leaders hoping to gain their support in elections.\n\nCrow Tribe Chairman Frank White Clay did not immediately respond to a message left with his office seeking comment.\n\nTester's campaign declined to comment on the matter.\n\nWhite Clay and other Crow representatives attended a rally last month in Bozeman featuring Trump and Sheehy. White Clay told an AP reporter at the rally that their presence was not meant as an endorsement. He said the tribe wanted to maintain good relations with whatever administration holds office.\n\nChar-Koosta News editor Sam Sandoval said Sheehy's campaign had not responded to his outlet's queries about the recordings, which he said came from a credible source who wanted the comments publicized in a tribal newspaper.\n\n\"For a lot of tribal people, having that statement out there, saying they're drunk at 8 o'clock in the morning, it really hits a sore spot that Natives have been working to change for years,\" Sandoval said.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)\n\nLAVEEN VILLAGE, Ariz. (AP) - President Joe Biden on Friday formally apologized to Native Americans for the \"sin\" of a government-run boarding school system that for decades forcibly separated children from their parents, calling it a \"blot on American history\" in his first presidential visit to Indian Country.\n\n\"It's a sin on our soul,\" said Biden, his voice full of anger and emotion. \"Quite frankly, there's no excuse that this apology took 50 years to make.\"\n\nIt was a moment of both contrition and frustration as the president sought to recognize one of the \"most horrific chapters\" in the national story. Biden spoke of the abuses and deaths of Native children that resulted from the federal government's policies, noting that \"while darkness can hide much, it erases nothing\" and that great nations \"must know the good, the bad, the truth of who we are.\"\n\n\"I formally apologize as president of United States of America for what we did,\" Biden said. The government's removal of children from their Native American community for boarding schools \"will always be a significant mark of shame, a blot on American history. For too long, this all happened with virtually no public attention, not written about in our history books, not taught in our schools.\"\n\nDemocrats hope Biden's visit to the Gila River Indian Community's land on the outskirts of Phoenix's metro area will also provide a boost to Vice President Kamala Harris' turnout effort in a key battleground state. The moment gave Biden a fuller chance to spotlight his and Harris' support for tribal nations, a group that historically has favored Democrats, in a state he won just by 10,000 votes in 2020.\n\nThe race between Harris and former President Donald Trump is expected to be similarly close, and both campaigns are doing whatever they can to improve turnout among bedrock supporters.\n\n\"The race is now a turnout grab,\" said Mike O'Neil, a non-partisan pollster based in Arizona. \"The trendlines throughout have been remarkably steady. The question is which candidate is going to be able to turn out their voters in a race that seems to be destined to be decided by narrow margins.\"\n\nBiden has been used sparingly on the campaign trail by Harris and other Democrats since he ended his reelection campaign in July.\n\nBut analysts say Biden could help Harris in her appeal with Native American voters - a group that has trailed others in turnout rates.\n\nIn 2020, there was a surge in voter turnout on some tribal land in Arizona as Biden beat Trump and became the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the state since Bill Clinton in 1996.\n\nBiden, whose presidency is winding down, had promised tribal leaders nearly two years ago that he would visit Indian Country.\n\nFor decades, federal boarding schools were used to assimilate children into white society, according to the White House. Not everyone saw the apology as sufficient.\n\n\"An apology is a nice start, but it is not a true reckoning, nor is it a sufficient remedy for the long history of colonial violence,\" said Chase Iron Eyes, director of the Lakota People's Law Project and Sacred Defense Fund.\n\nAt least 973 Native American children died in the U.S. government's abusive boarding school system over a 150-year period that ended in 1969, according to an Interior Department investigation that called for a U.S. government apology.\n\nAt least 18,000 children, some as young as 4, were taken from their parents and forced to attend schools that sought to assimilate them.\n\n\"President Biden deserves credit for finally putting attention on the issue and other issues impacting the community,\" said Ramona Charette Klein, 77, a boarding school survivor and an enrolled member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa. \"I do think that will reflect well on Vice President Harris, and I hope this momentum will continue.\"\n\nDemocrats have stepped up outreach to Native American communities.\n\nBoth Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz , met with tribal leaders in Arizona and Nevada this month. And Clinton, who has been serving as a surrogate for Harris, last week met in North Carolina with the chairman of the Lumbee Tribe.\n\nThe Democratic National Committee recently launched a six-figure ad campaign targeting Native American voters in Arizona, North Carolina, Montana and Alaska through digital, print and radio ads.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Ruben Gallego , who is locked in a competitive race with Republican Kari Lake for Arizona's open Senate seat, has visited all 22 of Arizona's federally recognized tribes.\n\nHarris started a recent campaign rally in Chandler, near where the Gila River reservation is located, with a shoutout to the tribe's leader. Walz is scheduled to go to the Navajo Nation in Arizona on Saturday.\n\nThe White House says Biden and Harris have built a substantial track record with Native Americans over the last four years.\n\nThe president designated the sacred Avi Kwa Ame, a desert mountain in Nevada and Baaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukveni-Ancestral Footprints of the Grand Canyon in Arizona as national monuments and restored the boundaries for Bears Ears National Monument in Utah.\n\nIn addition, the administration has directed nearly $46 billion in federal spending to tribal nations. The money has helped bring electricity to a reservation that never had electricity, expand access to high-speed internet, improve water sanitation, build roadways and more.\n\nBiden picked former New Mexico Rep. Deb Haaland to serve as his Interior secretary, the first Native American to be appointed to a Cabinet position. Haaland is a member of Laguna Pueblo in New Mexico.\n\nShe, in turn, ordered the comprehensive review in June 2021 of the troubled legacy of the federal government's boarding school policies that led Biden to deliver the formal apology.\n\nThom Reilly, co-director of the Center for an Independent and Sustainable Democracy at Arizona State University, said both Harris' and Trump's campaigns - and their allies - have put a remarkable amount of effort into micro-targeting in Arizona.\n\n\"They are pulling out every stop just to see if they could wrangle a few more votes here and there,\" Reilly said. \"The Indian community is one of those groups that Harris is hoping will overperform and help make the difference.\"\n\n___\n\nBoak reported from Washington.

(AP Photo/Matthew Brown)\n\nMISSION, S.D. (AP) - After her mother died when Rosalie Whirlwind Soldier was just four years old, she was put into a Native American boarding school in South Dakota and told her native Lakota language was \"devil's speak.\"\n\nShe recalls being locked in a basement at St. Francis Indian Mission School for weeks as punishment for breaking the school's strict rules. Her long braids were shorn in a deliberate effort to stamp out her cultural identify. And when she broke her leg in an accident, Whirlwind Soldier said she received shoddy care leaving her with pain and a limp that still hobbles her decades later.\n\n\"I thought there was no God, just torture and hatred,\" Whirlwind Soldier testified during a Saturday event on the Rosebud Sioux Reservation led by U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, as the agency confronts the bitter legacy of a boarding school system that operated in the U.S. for more than a century.\n\nNow 78 and still living on the reservation, Whirlwind Soldier said she was airing her horrific experiences in hopes of finally getting past them.\n\n\"The only thing they didn't do was put us in (an oven) and gas us,\" she said, comparing the treatment of Native Americans in the U.S. in the 19th and 20th centuries to the Jewish Holocaust during World War II.\n\n\"But I let it go,\" she later added. \"I'm going to make it.\"\n\nSaturday's event was the third in Haaland's yearlong \"Road to Healing\" initiative for victims of abuse at government-backed boarding schools, after previous stops in Oklahoma and Michigan.\n\nStarting with the Indian Civilization Act of 1819, the U.S. enacted laws and policies to establish and support the schools. The stated goal was to \"civilize\" Native Americans, Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians, but that was often carried out through abusive practices. Religious and private institutions that ran many of the schools received federal funding and were willing partners.\n\nMost closed their doors long ago and none still exist to strip students of their identities. But some, including St. Francis, still function as schools - albeit with drastically different missions that celebrate the cultural backgrounds of their Native students.\n\nFormer St. Francis student Ruby Left Hand Bull Sanchez traveled hundreds of miles from Denver to attend Saturday's meeting. She cried as she recalled almost being killed as a child when a nun stuffed lye soap down her throat in response to Sanchez praying in her native language.\n\n\"I want the world to know,\" she said.\n\nAccompanying Haaland was Wizipan Garriott, a Rosebud Sioux member and principal deputy assistant secretary for Indian affairs. Garriott described how boarding schools were part of a long history of injustices against his people that began with the widespread extermination of their main food source - bison, also known as buffalo.\n\n\"First they took our buffalo. Then our land was taken, then our children, and then our traditional form of religion, spiritual practices,\" he said. \"It's important to remember that we Lakota and other Indigenous people are still here. We can go through anything.\"\n\nThe first volume of an investigative report released by the Interior Department in May identified more than boarding 400 schools that the federal government supported beginning in the late 19th century and continuing well into the 1960s. It also found at least 500 children died at some of the schools, though that number is expected to increase dramatically as research continues.\n\nThe National Native American Boarding School Healing Coalition says it's tallied about 100 more schools not on the government list that were run by groups such as churches.\n\n\"They all had the same missions, the same goals: 'Kill the Indian, save the man,'\" said Lacey Kinnart, who works for the Minnesota-based coalition. For Native American children, Kinnart said the intention was \"to assimilate them and steal everything Indian out of them except their blood, make them despise who they are, their culture, and forget their language.\"\n\nSouth Dakota had 31 of the schools including two on the Rosebud Sioux Reservation - St. Francis and the Rosebud Agency Boarding and Day School.\n\nThe Rosebud Agency school, in Mission, operated through at least 1951 on a site now home to Sinte Gleska University, where Saturday's meeting happened.\n\nAll that remains of the boarding school is a gutted-out building that used to house the dining hall, according to tribal members. When the building caught fire about five years ago, former student Patti Romero, 73, said she and others were on hand to cheer its destruction.\n\n\"No more worms in the chili,\" said Romero, who attended the school from ages 6 to 15 and said the food was sometimes infested.\n\nA second report is pending in the investigation into the schools launched by Haaland, herself a Laguna Pueblo from New Mexico and the first Native American cabinet secretary. It will cover burial sites, the schools' impact on Indigenous communities and also try to account for federal funds spent on the troubled program.\n\nCongress is considering a bill to create a boarding school \"truth and healing commission,\" similar to one established in Canada in 2008. It would have a broader scope than the Interior Department's investigation into federally run boarding schools and subpoena power, if passed.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to accurately refer to Rosalie Whirlwind Soldier.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/David Yeazell)\n\nRED SPRINGS, N.C. (AP) - Native American communities were decisive voting blocs in key states in 2020, and with the 2024 race remaining stubbornly close both campaigns have tried to mobilize Native voters in the final weeks of the presidential election.\n\nBut when it comes to messaging, the two campaigns could not be more different, many Native voters said. It's been 100 years since Native Americans were given the right to vote, with the passage of the Snyder Act in 1924, and whichever campaign is able to harness their power in this election could swing some of the most hotly contested counties in the country.\n\nIn swing states like Arizona, North Carolina, Michigan, and Nevada, the candidates - particularly Vice President Kamala Harris - have been targeting Native Americans with radio ads and events on tribal lands featuring speakers like Bill Clinton and Donald Trump Jr.\n\nAP correspondent Julie Walker reports a century after Native Americans got the right to vote, they could put Donald Trump or Kamala Harris over the top.\n\nNative American voters tend to favor Democrats, but they're more likely to vote Republican than Latinos or African Americans, said Gabriel R. Sanchez, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. He said they are one of the least partisan and youngest voting demographics in the country, often motivated by issues that directly impact their communities, like land rights and environmental protections.\n\nIn 2020, the Biden administration campaigned in several tribal nations in critical states like Wisconsin and Arizona, and precincts on tribal lands there helped narrowly tip the election for the Democrats . \"Arizona was kind of like a textbook example of what that could look like if you make those early investments,\" Sanchez said.\n\nAs part of a $370 million ad campaign released this month, including on several reservations, Harris said the U.S. should honor treaty rights and uphold tribal sovereignty. Crystal Echo Hawk, CEO of IllumiNative, a nonprofit that works to increase the visibility of Native Americans, said those commitments, along with the economy and environmental protections, are the top issues Native voters have identified in IllumiNative's surveys.\n\nEcho Hawk said those investments could pay off again for the Democrats. \"I haven't seen the same kind of targeted messaging and outreach from the Trump campaign,\" she said. Harris also stands to inherit some of the goodwill left from the administrations of Barack Obama and Joe Biden , she said.\n\nObama increased consultation with tribes on matters like land protections and criminal justice, and Biden appointed more than 80 Native Americans to senior administration roles.\n\n\"The minute that the announcement came that Harris was stepping into the race, you saw people organize overnight,\" Echo Hawk said. And Trump, she said, will have to contend with his reduction of Bears Ears National Monument by 85% and his revival of the Keystone XL pipeline , both unpopular with Indigenous peoples. \"I think a lot of these people remember that,\" she said.\n\nOn Friday, Biden formally apologized for the country's support of Native American boarding schools and its legacy of abuse and cultural destruction. While seen as long overdue, it was met with praise from tribal leaders. On Saturday, vice presidential candidate and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will campaign in the Navajo Nation.\n\nThe Trump campaign hasn't released ads targeting Native Americans, but U.S. Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a Republican from Oklahoma and a citizen of the Cherokee Nation, has stumped for the former president in Native communities in North Carolina, a swing state that was decided by less than one point in 2020.\n\nOn a crisp evening earlier this month, Mullin sat alongside Donald Trump Jr. and former Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard , a former Democrat who recently announced she is joining the Republican Party, on a small stage in front of several bales of hay to take questions from an audience of a couple hundred people. They discussed issues ranging from the economy to tribal self-determination.\n\nThe event took place on a small farm in Red Springs, North Carolina, part of the traditional homelands of Mullin's ancestors and current home to the Lumbee Tribe, a state-recognized tribe with about 55,000 members.\n\nThe federal recognition of the Lumbee has been opposed by several tribal nations, including the nearby Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and Mullin's own tribe, the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma. The Lumbee's push for federal recognition has become a focal point for both campaigns and a rare issue where both parties agree. Last month, Trump said he would sign legislation granting federal recognition to the Lumbee. Harris called the Lumbee's tribal chairman last week to discuss the legislation.\n\n\"This is an injustice that needs to be fixed when it comes to Lumbees,\" Mullin told the crowd. \"This is absolutely absurd. It needs to be done. I was so proud to hear President Trump say that he would sign it.\"\n\nBut Mullin soon touched on one of the many areas where the two candidates differ: energy policy. Highlighting the fact that he believed a second Trump term would mean a better economy and lower energy costs, Mullin laid out Trump's policy in one recognizable term that was echoed by the audience, \"Drill, baby, drill.\"\n\nBoth the Biden and Trump administrations pushed to produce more oil and gas than ever, including extractive energy projects that were opposed by Indigenous peoples. However, Native leaders have expressed concern that Trump is more likely to further erode protections for tribal lands.\n\nMullin suggested that if tribal nations are truly sovereign, they should be able to conduct energy extraction without the burden of federal intervention. He said just like the Lumbee's fight for federal recognition, the rights of tribes to govern their own lands is the victim of federal bureaucracy.\n\n\"Why is tribal land treated like public land?\" Mullin asked, questioning why the federal government should have any oversight on tribal nations that extract natural resources on their own lands. \"You have natural resources being pulled out of the ground right across the fence from reservations. You have private land owners that are extremely wealthy and you have people that are literally starving inside reservations,\" he said, comparing some to third-world countries.\n\nHe promised Trump would have a deep understanding of tribal sovereignty.\n\nThat message resonated with Robert Chavis Jr., a physical education teacher and Army veteran who was at the rally and will be voting for Trump. Chavis, a member of the Lumbee Tribe, said tribal nations aren't just governments, they're businesses, and the U.S. is no different. \"I feel like you don't need a politician in there. We need a businessman to run the country like it should be.\"\n\nBut other Lumbee voters aren't as convinced. At her art gallery a few miles away in Pembroke, Janice Locklear said Trump promised he would federally recognize the Lumbee last time he was in office, and she had no reason to believe he could accomplish it this time. But looking broader than her community, she said what Trump did on Jan. 6, 2021 , represents a nationwide threat to democracy.\n\n\"He thought he could actually be a dictator, go in there and take over. Even though he had lost the election; he knew he had lost the election. So what do you think he'll do this time,\" she said.\n\nLocklear said as a woman of color, she trusts that Harris will have a deeper understanding of the unique challenges facing Native Americans. \"I'm sure she's had to face the same problems we face,\" Locklear said. \"Discrimination, I'm sure she's faced it.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(Erin Bormett/The Argus Leader via AP, File)\n\nLAVEEN VILLAGE, Ariz. (AP) - President Joe Biden did something Friday that no other sitting U.S. president has: He apologized for the systemic abuse of generations of Indigenous children endured in boarding schools at the hands of the federal government.\n\nFor 150 years the U.S. removed Indigenous children from their homes and sent them away to the schools, where they were stripped of their cultures, histories and religions and beaten for speaking their languages.\n\n\"We should be ashamed,\" Biden said to a crowd of Indigenous people gathered at the Gila River Indian Community outside of Phoenix, including tribal leaders, survivors and their families. Biden called the government-mandated system that began in 1819 \"one of the most horrific chapters in American history,\" while acknowledging the decades of abuse inflicted upon children and widespread devastation left behind.\n\nFor many Native Americans, the long-awaited apology was a welcome acknowledgment of the government's longstanding culpability. Now, they say, words must be followed up by action.\n\nBill Hall, 71, of Seattle, was 9 when he was taken from his Tlingit community in Alaska and forced to attend a boarding school , where he endured years of physical and sexual abuse that lead to many more years of shame. When he first heard that Biden was going to apologize, he wasn't sure he would be able to accept it.\n\n\"But, as I was watching, tears began to flow from my eyes,\" Hall said. \"Yes, I accept his apology. Now, what can we do next?\"\n\nRosalie Whirlwind Soldier, a 79-year-old citizen of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe, said she felt \"a tingle in my heart\" and was glad the historical wrong was being acknowledged. Still, she remains saddened by the irreversible harms done to her people.\n\nWhirlwind Soldier suffered severe mistreatment at a school in South Dakota that left her with a lifelong, painful limp. The Catholic-run, government-subsidized facility took away her faith and tried to stamp out her Lakota identity by cutting off her long braids, she said.\n\n\"Sorry is not enough. Nothing is enough when you damage a human being,\" she said. \"A whole generation of people and our future was destroyed for us.\"\n\nThe schools were designed both to assimilate Native American, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian children and to dispossess tribal nations of their land, according to an Interior Department investigation launched by Secretary Deb Haaland, the first Native American to lead the agency.\n\nIntroducing Biden on Friday, Haaland said that while the formal apology is an acknowledgement of a dark chapter, it is also a celebration of Indigenous resilience: \"Despite everything that happened, we are still here.\"\n\nHaaland, a citizen of the Pueblo of Laguna, commissioned the investigation in 2021. It documented the cases of more than 18,000 Indigenous children, of whom 973 were killed. Both the report and independent researchers say the overall number was much higher.\n\nThe report came with several recommendations taken from the testimony of school survivors, including resources for mental health treatment and language revitalization programs.\n\nGila River Indian Community Gov. Stephen Roe Lewis noted that Biden has pledged to make good on those recommendations.\n\n\"This lays the framework to address the boarding school policies of the past,\" he said.\n\nBenjamin Mallott, president of the Alaska Federation of Natives, who is Lingít, said in a statement that the apology must be accompanied by meaningful actions: \"This includes revitalizing our languages and cultures and bringing home our Native children who have not yet been returned, so they can be laid to rest with their families and in their communities.\"\n\nThat view is shared by Victoria Kitcheyan, chairwoman of the Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska, which sued the U.S. Army in January seeking the return of the remains of two children who died at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in Pennsylvania.\n\n\"That healing doesn't start until tribes have a pathway to bring their children home to be laid to rest,\" Kitcheyan said.\n\nIn an interview Thursday, Haaland said Interior is still working with several tribal nations to repatriate the remains of several children who were killed and buried at a boarding school.\n\nDemocratic U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who introduced a bill last year to establish a truth and healing commission to address the harms caused by the boarding school system, called the apology \"a historic step toward long-overdue accountability for the harms done to Native children and their communities.\"\n\nAnd Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican who is vice chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, also commended Biden while saying it reinforces the need for a truth and healing commission.\n\n\"This acknowledgement of the pain and injustices inflicted upon Indigenous communities - while long overdue - is an extremely important step toward healing,\" Murkowski said in a statement.\n\nAs Biden spoke Friday, tribal members rose to their feet, with many recording the moment on their phones. Some wore traditional garments, and others had shirts supporting Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThere was a moment of silence, the formal apology and then an eruption of applause.\n\nAt the end of Biden's remarks, the crowd stood again. There were shouts of, \"Thank you, Joe.\"\n\nHall, the boarding school survivor in Seattle, and others have long been advocating for resources to redress the harm. He worries that tribal nations will continue to struggle with healing unless the government steps up, and he sees a long road yet ahead.\n\n\"It took a lifetime to get here. It's going to take a lifetime to get to the other side,\" he said. \"And that's the very sad part of it. I won't see it in my generation.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Matthew Brown in Billings, Montana, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

      "text": "A New History of the First Peoples in the Americas\n\nThe miracle of modern genetics has revolutionized the story anthropologists tell about how humans spread out across the Earth.\n\nEuropeans arriving in the New World met people all the way from the frozen north to the frozen south. All had rich and mature cultures and established languages. The Skraeling were probably a people we now call Thule, who were the ancestors of the Inuit in Greenland and Canada and the Iñupiat in Alaska. The Taíno were a people spread across multiple chiefdoms around the Caribbean and Florida. Based on cultural and language similarities, we think that they had probably separated from earlier populations from South American lands, now Guyana and Trinidad. The Spanish brought no women with them in 1492, and raped the Taíno women, resulting in the first generation of \"mestizo\"-mixed ancestry people.\n\nImmediately upon arrival, European alleles began to flow, admixed into the indigenous population, and that process has continued ever since: European DNA is found today throughout the Americas, no matter how remote or isolated a tribe might appear to be. But before Columbus, these continents were already populated. The indigenous people hadn't always been there, nor had they originated there, as some of their traditions state, but they had occupied these American lands for at least 20,000 years.\n\nThis article is adapted from Rutherford's new book .\n\nIt's only because of the presence of Europeans from the 15th century onward that we even have terms such as Indians or Native Americans. How these people came to be is a subject that is complex and fraught, but it begins in the north. Alaska is separated from Russian land by the Bering Strait. There are islands that punctuate those icy waters, and on a clear day U.S. citizens of Little Diomede can see Russians on Big Diomede, just a little over two miles and one International Date Line away. Between December and June, the water between them freezes solid.\n\nFrom 30,000 years ago until around 11,000 B.C., the earth was subjected to a cold snap that sucked up the sea into glaciers and ice sheets extending from the poles. This period is known as the Last Glacial Maximum, when the reach of the most recent Ice Age was at its fullest. By drilling mud cores out of the seabed, we can reconstruct a history of the land and the seas, notably by measuring concentrations of oxygen, and looking for pollen, which would have been deposited on dry ground from the flora growing there. We think therefore that sea level was somewhere between 60 and 120 meters lower than today. So it was terra firma all the way from Alaska to Russia, and all the way down south to the Aleutians-a crescent chain of volcanic islands that speckle the north Pacific.\n\nThe prevailing theory about how the people of the Americas came to those lands is via that bridge. We refer to it as a land bridge, though given its duration and size, it was simply continuous land, thousands of miles from north to south; it's only a bridge if we view it in comparison to today's straits. The area is called Beringia, and the first people across it the Beringians. These were harsh lands, sparse with shrubs and herbs; to the south, there were boreal woodlands, and where the land met the sea, kelp forests and seals.\n\nThough these were still tough terrains, according to archaeological finds Western Beringians were living near the Yana River in Siberia by 30,000 B.C. There's been plenty of debate over the years as to when exactly people reached the eastern side, and therefore at what point after the seas rose they became isolated as the founding peoples of the Americas. The questions that remain-and there are many-concern whether they came all at once or in dribs and drabs. Sites in the Yukon that straddle the U.S.-Alaskan border with Canada give us clues, such as the Bluefish Caves, 33 miles southwest of the village of Old Crow.\n\nThe latest radio-dating analysis of the remnants of lives in the Bluefish Caves indicates that people were there 24,000 years ago. These founding peoples spread over 12,000 years to every corner of the continents and formed the pool from which all Americans would be drawn until 1492. I will focus on North America here, and what we know so far, what we can know through genetics, and why we don't know more.\n\nUntil Columbus, the Americas were populated by pockets of tribal groups distributed up and down both north and south continents. There are dozens of individual cultures that have been identified by age, location, and specific technologies-and via newer ways of knowing the past, including genetics and linguistics. Scholars have hypothesized various patterns of migration from Beringia into the Americas. Over time, it has been suggested that there were multiple waves, or that a certain people with particular technologies spread from north all the way south.\n\nBoth ideas have now fallen from grace. The multiple-waves theory has failed as a model because the linguistic similarities used to show patterns of migration are just not that convincing. And the second theory fails because of timing. Cultures are often named and known by the technology that they left behind. In New Mexico there is a small town called Clovis, population 37,000. In the 1930s, projectile points resembling spearheads and other hunting paraphernalia were found in an archaeological site nearby, dating from around 13,000 years ago. These were knapped on both sides-bifaced with fluted tips. It had been thought that it was the inventors of these tools who had been the first people to spread up and down the continents. But there's evidence of humans living in southern Chile 12,500 years ago without Clovis technology. These people are too far away to show a direct link between them and the Clovis in such a way that indicates the Clovis being the aboriginals of South America.\n\nToday, the emerging theory is that the people up in the Bluefish Caves some 24,000 years ago were the founders, and that they represent a culture that was isolated for thousands of years up in the cold north, incubating a population that would eventually seed everywhere else. This idea has become known as Beringian Standstill. Those founders had split from known populations in Siberian Asia some 40,000 years ago, come across Beringia, and stayed put until around 16,000 years ago.\n\nAnalysis of the genomes of indigenous people show 15 founding mitochondrial types not found in Asia. This suggests a time when genetic diversification occurred, an incubation lasting maybe 10,000 years. New gene variants spread across the American lands, but not back into Asia, as the waters had cut them off. Nowadays, we see lower levels of genetic diversity in modern Native Americans-derived from just those original 15-than in the rest of the world. Again, this supports the idea of a single, small population seeding the continents, and-unlike in Europe or Asia-these people being cut off, with little admixture from new populations for thousands of years, at least until Columbus.\n\nIn Montana, 20 miles or so off Highway 90, lies the minuscule conurbation of Wilsall, population 178 as of 2010. Though stacks of material culture in the Clovis tradition have been recovered throughout North America, only one person from this time and culture has risen from his grave. He's acquired the name Anzick-1, and was laid to rest in a rock shelter in what would become-around 12,600 years later-Wilsall. He was a toddler, probably less than two years old, judging from the unfused sutures in his skull. He was laid to rest surrounded by at least 100 stone tools, and 15 ivory ones. Some of these were covered in red ochre, and together they suggest Anzick was a very special child who had been ceremonially buried in splendor. Now he's special because we have his complete genome.\n\nAnd there's the woeful saga of Kennewick Man. While attending a hydroplane race in 1996, two locals of Kennewick, Washington, discovered a broad-faced skull inching its way out of the bank of the Columbia River. Over the weeks and years, more than 350 fragments of bone and teeth were eked out of this 8,500-year-old grave, all belonging to a middle-aged man, maybe in his 40s, deliberately buried, with some signs of injuries that had healed over his life-a cracked rib, an incision from a spear, a minor depression fracture on his forehead. There were academic squabbles about his facial morphology, with some saying it was most similar to Japanese skulls, some arguing for a link with Polynesians, and some asserting he must have been European.\n\nWith all the toing and froing about his morphology, DNA should be a rich source of conclusive data for this man. But the political controversies about his body have severely hampered his value to science for 20 years. For Native Americans, he became known as the Ancient One, and five clans, notably the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, wanted to have him ceremonially reburied under guidelines determined by the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), which affords custodial rights to Native American artifacts and bodies found on their lands. Scientists sued the government to prevent his reburial, some claiming that his bones suggested he was European, and therefore not connected with Native Americans.\n\nTo add an absurd cherry on top of this already distasteful cake, a Californian pagan group called the Asatru Folk Assembly put in a bid for the body, claiming Kennewick Man might have a Norse tribal identity, and if science could establish that the body was European, then he should be given a ceremony in honor of Odin, ruler of the mythical Asgard, though what that ritual entails is not clear.\n\nHis reburial was successfully blocked in 2002, when a judge ruled that his facial bones suggested he was European, and therefore NAGPRA guidelines could not be invoked. The issue was batted back and forth for years, in a manner in which no one came out looking good. Nineteen years after this important body was found, the genome analysis was finally published.\n\nHad he been European (or Japanese or Polynesian), it would've been the most revolutionary find in the history of U.S. anthropology, and all textbooks on human migration would have been rewritten. But of course he wasn't. A fragment of material was used to sequence his DNA, and it showed that lo and behold, Kennewick Man-the Ancient One-was closely related to the Anzick baby. And as for the living, he was more closely related to Native Americans than to anyone else on Earth, and within that group, most closely related to the Colville tribes.\n\nAnzick is firm and final proof that North and South America were populated by the same people. Anzick's mitochondrial genome is most similar to people of central and south America today. The genes of the Ancient One most closely resemble those of tribes in the Seattle area today. These similarities do not indicate that either were members of those tribes or people, nor that their genes have not spread throughout the Americas, as we would expect over timescales of thousands of years. What they show is that the population dynamics-how ancient indigenous people relate to contemporary Native Americans-is complex and varies from region to region. No people are completely static, and genes less so.\n\nIn December 2016, in one of his last acts in office, President Barack Obama signed legislation that allowed Kennewick Man to be reburied as a Native American. Anzick was found on private land, so not subject to NAGPRA rules, but was reburied anyway in 2014 in a ceremony involving a few different tribes. We sometimes forget that though the data should be pure and straightforward, science is done by people, who are never either.\n\nAnzick and Kennewick Man represent narrow samples-a tantalizing glimpse of the big picture. And politics and history are hampering progress. The legacy of 500 years of occupation has fostered profound difficulty in understanding how the Americas were first peopled. Two of the doyennes of this field-Connie Mulligan and Emőke Szathmáry-suggest that there is a long cultural tradition that percolates through our attempts to deconstruct the past.\n\nEuropeans are taught a history of migration from birth, of Greeks and Romans spreading over Europe, conquering lands, and interloping afar. Judeo-Christian lore puts people in and out of Africa and Asia, and the silk routes connect Europeans with the East and back again. Many European countries have been seafaring nations, exploring and sometimes belligerently building empires for commerce or to impose a perceived superiority over other people. Even though we have national identities, and pride and traditions that come with that sense of belonging, European culture is imbued with migration.\n\nFor Native Americans, this is not their culture. Not all believe they have always been in their lands, nor that they are a static people. But for the most part, the narrative of migration does not threaten European identity in the same way that it might for the people we called the Indians. The scientifically valid notion of the migration of people from Asia into the Americas may challenge Native creation stories. It may also have the effect of conflating early modern migrants from the 15th century onward with those from 24,000 years earlier, with the effect of undermining indigenous claims to land and sovereignty.\n\n* * *\n\nDeep among the lakes of the Grand Canyon are the Havasupai. Their name means \"people of the blue-green waters,\" and they've been there for at least 800 years. They're a small tribe, around 650 members today, and they use ladders, horses, and sometimes helicopters to travel in and out of-or rather, up and down-the canyon. The tribe is rife with type 2 diabetes, and in 1990, the Havasupai people agreed to provide Arizona State University scientists with DNA from 151 individuals with the understanding that they would seek genetic answers to the puzzle of why diabetes was so common. Written consent was obtained, and blood samples were taken.\n\nAn obvious genetic link to diabetes was not found, but the researchers continued to use their DNA to test for schizophrenia and patterns of inbreeding. The data was also passed on to other scientists who were interested in migration and the history of Native Americans. The Havasupai only found this out years later, and eventually sued the university. In 2010, they were awarded $700,000 in compensation.\n\nTherese Markow was one of the scientists involved, and insists that consent was on the papers they signed, and that the forms were necessarily simple, as many Havasupai do not have English as a first language, and many did not graduate from high school. But many in the tribe thought that they were being asked only about their endemic diabetes. A blood sample contains an individual's entire genome, and with it, reams of data about that individual, their family, and evolution.\n\nThis isn't the first time this has happened. In the 1980s, before the days of easy and cheap genomics, blood samples were taken with consent to analyze the unusually high levels of rheumatic disease in the Nuu-chah-nulth people of the Pacific Northwest of Canada. The project, led by the late Ryk Ward, then at the University of British Columbia, found no genetic link in their samples, and the project petered out. By the '90s, though, Ward had moved to the University of Utah, and then Oxford in the U.K., and the blood samples had been used in anthropological and HIV/AIDS studies around the world, which turned into grants, academic papers, and a PBS-BBC jointly produced documentary.\n\nThe use of the samples for historical migration indicated that the origins of the Havasupai were from ancient ancestors in Siberia, which is in accordance with our understanding of human history by all scientific and archaeological methods. But it is in opposition to the Havasupai religious belief that they were created in situ in the Grand Canyon. Though nonscientific, it is perfectly within their rights to preclude investigations that contradict their stories, and those rights appear to have been violated. Havasupai Vice Chairman Edmond Tilousi told The New York Times in 2010 that \"coming from the canyon ... is the basis of our sovereign rights.\"\n\nSovereignty and membership of a tribe is a complex and hard-won thing. It includes a concept called \"blood quantum,\" which is effectively the proportion of one's ancestors who are already members of a tribe. It's an invention of European Americans in the 19th century, and though most tribes had their own criteria for tribal membership, most eventually adopted Blood Quantum as part of the qualification for tribal status.\n\nDNA is not part of that mix. With our current knowledge of the genomics of Native Americans, there is no possibility of DNA being anywhere near a useful tool in ascribing tribal status to people. Furthermore, given our understanding of ancestry and family trees, I have profound doubts that DNA could ever be used to determine tribal membership. While mtDNA (which is passed down from mothers to children) and the Y chromosome (passed from fathers to sons) have both proved profoundly useful in determining the deep ancestral trajectory of the first peoples of the Americas into the present, these two chromosomes represent a tiny proportion of the total amount of DNA that an individual bears. The rest, the autosomes, comes from all of one's ancestors.\n\nSome genetic genealogy companies will sell you kits that claim to grant you membership to historical peoples, albeit ill-defined, highly romanticized versions of ancient Europeans. This type of genetic astrology, though unscientific and distasteful to my palate, is really just a bit of meaningless fantasy; its real damage is that it undermines scientific literacy in the general public.\n\nOver centuries, people have been too mobile to have remained genetically isolated for any significant length of time. Tribes are known to have mixed before and after colonialism, which should be enough to indicate that some notion of tribal purity is at best imagined. Of the genetic markers that have been shown to exist in individual tribes so far, none is exclusive. Some tribes have begun to use DNA as a test to verify immediate family, such as in paternity cases, and this can be useful as part of qualification for tribal status. But on its own, a DNA test cannot place someone in a specific tribe.\n\nThat hasn't stopped the emergence of some companies in the United States that sell kits that claim to use DNA to ascribe tribal membership. Accu-Metrics is one such company. On its web page, it states that there are \"562 recognized tribes in the United States, plus at least 50 others in Canada, divided into First Nation, Inuit, and Metis.\" For $125 the company claims that it \" can determine if you belong to one of these groups .\"\n\nThe idea that tribal status is encoded in DNA is both simplistic and wrong. Many tribespeople have non-native parents and still retain a sense of being bound to the tribe and the land they hold sacred. In Massachusetts, members of the Seaconke Wampanoag tribe identified European and African heritage in their DNA, due to hundreds of years of interbreeding with New World settlers. Attempting to conflate tribal status with DNA denies the cultural affinity that people have with their tribes. It suggests a kind of purity that genetics cannot support, a type of essentialism that resembles scientific racism.\n\nThe specious belief that DNA can bestow tribal identity, as sold by companies such as Accu-Metrics, can only foment further animosity-and suspicion-toward scientists. If a tribal identity could be shown by DNA (which it can't), then perhaps reparation rights afforded to tribes in recent years might be invalid in the territories to which they were moved during the 19th century. Many tribes are effective sovereign nations and therefore not necessarily bound by the laws of the state in which they live.\n\nWhen coupled with cases such as that of the Havasupai, and centuries of racism, the relationship between Native Americans and geneticists is not healthy. After the legal battles over the remains of Kennewick Man were settled, and it was accepted that he was not of European descent, the tribes were invited to join in the subsequent studies. Out of five, only the Colville Tribes did. Their representative, James Boyd, told The New York Times in 2015, \"We were hesitant. Science hasn't been good to us.\"\n\nData is supreme in genetics, and data is what we crave. But we are the data, and people are not there for the benefit of others, regardless of how noble one's scientific aims are. To deepen our understanding of how we came to be and who we are, scientists must do better, and invite people whose genes provide answers to not only volunteer their data, but to participate, to own their individual stories, and to be part of that journey of discovery.\n\nThis is beginning to change. A new model of engagement with the first people of the Americas is emerging, albeit at a glacial pace. The American Society of Human Genetics meeting is the annual who's who in genetics, and has been for many years, where all of the newest and biggest ideas in the study of human biology are discussed. In October 2016 they met in Vancouver, and it was hosted by the Squamish Nation, a First Nations people based in British Colombia. They greeted the delegates with song, and passed the talking stick to the president for the proceedings to begin.\n\nThe relationship between science and indigenous people has been one characterized by a range of behaviors from outright exploitation to casual insensitivity to tokenism and lip service. Perhaps this time is coming to an end and we might foster a relationship based on trust, genuine engagement, and mutual respect, so that we might work together and build the capacity for tribes to lead their own research into the histories of these nations.\n\n* * *\n\nThough the terms Native American and Indian are relative, the United States is a nation of immigrants and descendants of slaves who have overwhelmed the indigenous population. Less than 2 percent of the current population defines itself as Native American, which means that 98 percent of Americans are unable to trace their roots, genetic or otherwise, beyond 500 years on American soil. That is, however, plenty of time for populations to come and breed and mix and lay down patterns of ancestry that can be enlightened with living DNA as our historical text.\n\nA comprehensive genetic picture of the people of postcolonial North America was revealed at the beginning of 2017, drawn from data submitted by paying customers to the genealogy company AncestryDNA. The genomes of more than 770,000 people born in the United States were filtered for markers of ancestry, and revealed a picture of mishmash, as you might expect from a country of immigrants.\n\nNevertheless, genetic clusters of specific European countries are seen. Paying customers supply spit harboring their genomes, alongside whatever genealogical data they have. By aligning these as carefully as possible, a map of post-Columbus America can be summoned with clusters of common ancestry, such as Finnish and Swedish in the Midwest, and Acadians-French-speaking Canadians from the Atlantic seaboard-clustering way down in Louisiana, close to New Orleans, where the word Acadian has mutated into Cajun. Here, genetics recapitulates history, as we know the Acadians were forcibly expelled by the British in the 18th century, and many eventually settled in Louisiana, then under Spanish control.\n\nIn trying to do something similar with African Americans, we immediately stumble. Most black people in the United States cannot trace their genealogy with much precision because of the legacy of slavery. Their ancestors were seized from West Africa, leaving little or no record of where they were born. In 2014, the genetic genealogy company 23andMe published its version of the population structure of the United States. In that portrait we see a similar pattern of European admixture, and some insights into the history of the postcolonial United States.\n\nThe Emancipation Proclamation-a federal mandate to change the legal status of slaves to free-was issued by President Lincoln in 1863, though the effects were not necessarily immediate. In the genomic data, there's admixture between European DNA and African that begins in earnest around six generations ago, roughly in the mid-19th century. Within these samples we see more male European DNA and female African, measured by Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA, suggesting male Europeans had sex with female slaves. Genetics makes no comment on the nature of these relations.\n\nThis post is adapted from Rutherford's upcoming book, A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived: The Human Story Retold Through Our Genes ."

      "text": "Rethinking the European Conquest of Native Americans\n\nIn a new book by Pekka Hämäläinen, a picture emerges of a four-century-long struggle for primacy among Native power centers in North America.\n\nW hen the term Indian appears in the Declaration of Independence, it is used to refer to \"savage\" outsiders employed by the British as a way of keeping the colonists down. Eleven years later, in the U.S. Constitution, the Indigenous peoples of North America are presented  differently: as separate entities with which the federal government must negotiate. They also appear as insiders who are clearly within the borders of the new country yet not to be counted for purposes of representation. The same people are at once part of the oppression that justifies the need for independence, a rival for control of land, and a subjugated minority whose rights are ignored.\n\nFor the Finnish scholar Pekka Hämäläinen, this emphasis on what Native people meant to white Americans misses an important factor: Native power. The lore about Jamestown and Plymouth, Pocahontas and Squanto, leads many Americans to think in terms of tragedy and, eventually, disappearance. But actually, Indigenous people continued to control most of the interior continent long after they were outnumbered by the descendants of Europeans and Africans.\n\nMuch more accurate is the picture Hämäläinen paints in his new book, Indigenous Continent : a North American history that encompasses 400 years of wars that Natives often, even mostly, won-or did not lose decisively in the exceptional way that the Powhatans and Pequots had by the 1640s. Out of these centuries of broader conflict with newcomers and one another, Native peoples established decentralized hives of power, and even new empires.\n\nIn a previous book, The Comanche Empire , Hämäläinen wrote of what he controversially referred to as a \"reversed colonialism,\" which regarded the aggressive, slaving equestrians of \"greater Comanchería\"-an area covering most of the Southwest-as imperialists in ways worth comparing to the French, English, Dutch, and Spanish in America. There was continued pushback from some scholars when Hämäläinen extended the argument northward in his 2019 study, Lakota America . (The impact of his work among historians may be measured by his appointment as the Rhodes Professor of American History at Oxford University.)\n\nWhat was most distinctive about these two previous books was that Hämäläinen so convincingly explained the Indigenous strategies for survival and even conquest. Instead of focusing on the microbes that decimated Native populations, Hämäläinen showed how the Comanche developed what he termed a \"politics of grass.\" A unique grasslands ecosystem in the plains allowed them to cultivate huge herds of horses and gave the Comanche access to bison, which they parlayed into market dominance over peoples who could supply other goods they wanted, such as guns, preserved foods, and slaves for both trade and service as herders.\n\nRead: Return the national parks to the tribes\n\nHämäläinen treats Native civilizations as polities making war and alliances. In Indigenous Continent , there is less emphasis than in The Comanche Empire on specific ecosystems and how they informed Indigenous strategies. Instead, he describes so many Native nations and European settlements adapting to one another over such a wide and long time period that readers can appreciate anew how their fates were intertwined-shattering the simple binary of \"Indians\" and \"settlers.\" Indigenous peoples adapted strenuously and seasonally to environments that remained under their control but had to contend at the same time with Europeans and other refugees encroaching on their vague borders. These newcomers could become allies, kin, rivals, or victims.\n\nH ämäläinen sees a larger pattern of often-blundering Europeans becoming part of Indigenous systems of reciprocity or exploitation, followed by violent resets. When Dutch or French traders were \"generous with their wares\" and did not make too many political demands, Natives pulled them into their orbit. Spanish and, later, British colonists, by contrast, more often demanded obeisance and control over land, leading to major conflicts such as the ones that engulfed the continent in the 1670s-80s and during the Seven Years' War. These wars redirected European imperial projects, leading to the destruction of some nations, and the migration and recombination of others, such as the westward movement of the Lakota that led to their powerful position in the Missouri River Valley and, later, farther west. In this history, Indigenous \"nomadic\" mobility becomes grand strategy. North America is a continent of migrants battling for position long before the so-called nation of immigrants.\n\n\"Properly managed,\" settlers and their goods \"could be useful,\" Hämäläinen writes. The five nations of the Iroquois (Haudenosaunee) confederacy established a pattern by turning tragic depopulation by epidemic into opportunities for what Hämäläinen calls  \"mourning wars\" attacking weakened tribes and gaining captives. They formed new alliances and capitalized on their geographic centrality between fur-supplying nations to the west and north, and French and Dutch and, later, English tool and gun suppliers to the east and south. Hämäläinen insists that their warfare was \"measured, tactical,\" that their use of torture was \"political spectacle,\" that their captives were actually adoptees, that their switching of sides in wartime and the Iroquois' selling out of distant client tribes such as the Delaware was a \"principled plasticity.\" This could almost be an expert on European history talking about the Plantagenets, the Hapsburgs, or Rome.\n\nAnd there's the rub. Hämäläinen, a northern European, feels comfortable applying the ur-Western genre of the rise and fall of empires to Native America, but imperial history comes with more baggage. Hämäläinen seems certain that Comanche or other Indigenous imperial power was different in nature from the European varieties, but it often seems as if Indigenous peoples did many of the same things that European conquerors did. Whether the Iroquois had \"imperial moments,\" actually were an empire, or only played one for diplomatic advantage is only part of the issue. Hämäläinen doesn't like the phrase settler colonialism . He worries that the current term of art for the particularly Anglo land-grabbing, eliminationist version of empire paints with too broad a brush. Perhaps it does. But so does his undefined concept of empire, which seems to play favorites at least as much as traditional European histories do.\n\nIf an empire is an expanding, at least somewhat centralized polity that exploits the resources of other entities, then the Iroquois, Comanche, Lakota, and others may well qualify. But what if emphasizing the prowess of warriors and chiefs, even if he refers to them as \"soldiers\" and \"officials,\" paradoxically reinforces exoticizing stereotypes? Hämäläinen is so enthralled with the surprising power and adaptability of the tribes that he doesn't recognize the contradiction between his small-is-beautful praise of decentralized Indigenous cultures and his condescension toward Europeans huddling in their puny, river-hugging farms and towns.\n\nHämäläinen notes that small Native nations could be powerful too, and decisive in wars. His savvy Indigenous imperialists wisely prioritized their relationships, peaceful or not, with other Natives, using the British or French as suppliers of goods. Yet he praises them for the same resource exploitation and trade manipulation that appears capitalist and murderous when European imperialists do their version. In other words, he praises Natives when they win for winning. Who expanded over space, who won, is the story; epic battles are the chapters; territory is means and end.\n\nAnd the wheel turns fast, followed by the rhetoric. When British people muscle out Natives or seek to intimidate them at treaty parleys, they are \"haughty.\" At the same time, cannibalism and torture are ennobled as strategies-when they empower Natives. Native power as terror may help explain genocidal settler responses, but it makes natives who aren't just plain brave-including women, who had been producers of essential goods and makers of peace-fade away almost as quickly as they did in the old history. As readers, we gain a continental perspective, but strangely, we miss the forest for the battlefields.\n\nRead: Rez life\n\nIt's already well known why natives lost their land and, by the 19th century, no longer had regional majorities: germs, technology, greed, genocidal racism, and legal chicanery, not always in that order. Settler-colonial theory zeroes in on the desire to replace the Native population, one way or another, for a reason: Elimination was intended even when it failed in North America for generations.\n\nTo Hämäläinen, Natives dominated so much space for hundreds of years because of their \"resistance,\" which he makes literally the last word of his book. Are power and resistance the same thing? Many scholars associated with the Native American and Indigenous Studies Association find it outrageous to associate any qualities of empire with colonialism's ultimate, and ongoing, victims. The academic and activist Nick Estes has accused Hämäläinen of \"moral relativist\" work that is \"titillating white settler fantasies\" and \"winning awards\" for doing so. Native American scholars, who labor as activists and community representatives as well as academics in white-dominated institutions, are especially skeptical when Indigenous people are seen as powerful enough to hurt anyone, even if the intent is to make stock figures more human. In America, tales of Native strength and opportunistic mobility contributed to the notion that all Natives were the same, and a threat to peace. The alternative categories of victim and rapacious settler help make better arguments for reparative justice.\n\nIn this light, the controversy over Native empires is reminiscent of what still happens when it's pointed out that Africans participated in the slave trade-an argument used by anti-abolitionists in the 19th century and ever since to evade blame for the new-world slaveries that had turned deadlier and ideologically racial. It isn't coincidental that Hämäläinen, as a fan of the most powerful Natives, renders slavery among Indigenous people as captivity and absorption, not as the commodified trade it became over time. Careful work by historians has made clear how enslavement of and by Natives became, repeatedly, a diplomatic tool and an economic engine that created precedents for the enslavement of Black Americans.\n\nAll genres of history have their limits, often shaped by politics. That should be very apparent in the age of the 1619 and 1776 projects. Like the Declaration and the Constitution, when it comes to Indigenous peoples, historians are still trying to have it both ways. Books like these are essential because American history needs to be seen from all perspectives, but there will be others that break more decisively with a story that's focused on the imperial winners.\n\nWhen you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

      "text": "How America's Past Shapes Native Americans' Present\n\nA Minneapolis community seeks to counteract centuries of federal policies that have put its people at a disadvantage.\n\nMINNEAPOLIS, Minn.-Native American poverty doesn't fit the image many may have of life on secluded, depleted reservations. Most Native Americans now live in cities , where many are still trying to adjust to urban life; as a group, Native Americans face a 27 percent poverty rate and are still trying to reverse some of the lasting effects of federal policies that have put them at a disadvantage for hundreds of years.\n\nThe Indian Relocation Act of 1956 was the impetus for the relocation of the large number of Native Americans now living in urban areas. Though the act didn't force people to leave their reservations, it made it hard for families to stay by dissolving federal recognition of most tribes, and ending federal funding for reservations' schools, hospitals, and basic services-along with the jobs they created. Though the federal government paid for relocation expenses to the cities, and provided some vocational training, urban Native Americans faced high levels of job discrimination, and few opportunities for job advancement .\n\nMinneapolis was one of the first cities chosen for the federal relocation program. Here, the Native American community has taken some bold steps to aid integration, such as opening public schools tailored to Native American students' needs and maintaining the country's only federally subsidized housing project for Native Americans. In the 1970s, Minneapolis became the headquarters of the national American Indian Movement, a civil-rights group. Among other achievements, it pressured the federal government to restore tribal recognition and sovereignty.\n\nThe group was working to undo hundreds of years of federal policy that has played a role in producing modern-day Native American poverty. Two early such policies were the forced relocation of Native Americans to reservations and the creation, in 1824, of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. Later that century, there was a movement to \"civilize,\" or assimilate, Native Americans, and the Bureau created federal boarding schools, where Native American children were separated from their parents and only allowed to speak English and play sports that had European origins. According to Carolyn J. Marr, an anthropologist and a librarian at Seattle's Museum of History and Industry, the schools sought to \" eradicate all vestiges of their tribal cultures .\"\n\nIn the 1930s, these boarding schools began closing after an independent evaluation revealed that students were malnourished and living in poor, overcrowded conditions. Eventually, Congress decided that assimilation would work better, and encouraged Native Americans to leave reservations and move to cities-hence the Indian Relocation Act of 1956, which ended federal recognition of most tribes. Though civil-rights movements in the 1960s would eventually pressure the government to restore the recognition of dozens of tribes, the impact of earlier policies remained; the Bureau of Indian Affairs remains the legal steward of most tribal lands, making it extremely difficult for Native Americans to own property and build wealth in the way other Americans can.\n\nAs a result of the Indian Relocation Act, Minneapolis also became home to a tight-knit Native American community, with a majority from Minnesota's large Ojibwe and Lakota tribes. Native Americans now make up 7 percent of residents in the Phillips neighborhood in the southern part of Minneapolis, which is also the city's poorest neighborhood -about 48 percent of people there live in poverty. It's home to the Minneapolis American Indian Center, the Native American Community Clinic, the Native American Community Development Institute, and the Minnesota Indian Women's Resource Center. At the edge of the neighborhood is Little Earth of the United Tribes, the country's only HUD-subsidized housing project that gives preference to Native Americans. More than a thousand people live in the sprawling complex, which was founded in 1973 with the help of the American Indian Movement. The purpose was to create a sense of community, and affordable housing, for Native Americans who were migrating to the city.\n\nWhen I visited the Phillips neighborhood, I understood why Little Earth was the heart of city's Native American community. Spray-painted murals of tribal chiefs brightened walkways and a pedestrian bridge. I met with Frank Downwind, the director of youth services at Little Earth. Downwind is a Red Lake Chippewa, and though he was born in South Minneapolis, he spent part of his childhood on the reservation, about a five-hour drive away. \"There is not a lot of opportunity on the reservation if you're not into hunting or fishing,\" he said. \"It's easy to fall into unhealthy lifestyles.\"\n\nWhile Little Earth has become a magnet for crime and drugs, Downwind says it also provides residents with strong support through a myriad of social services. Little Earth recently renovated several houses in the neighborhood for families who wanted to become homeowners but didn't want to leave the area. Downwind recently bought himself a house in the suburbs, but says he feels a bit isolated and out of place. \"Sometimes I regret leaving,\" he told me. \"For all the bad stuff that goes on here, to live in a community where people know you and kids run up to you, that's something hard to find.\"\n\nOne of the teenagers who goes to Little Earth's youth center after school is Chavanna Rodriguez, who is 17 years old and half Lakota. She says a lot of kids go to the center to find a haven from the neighborhood's endemic drug culture. She thinks a lot of the pain-pill addictions she sees are directly related to poverty. \"A lot of people are struggling and hurt, and it lets them escape,\" she told me. Rodriguez wants to go to college, but doesn't know anyone who has ever done that. \"It may take me five years to graduate [high school], but I will.\"\n\nLow high-school graduation rates among Native American teens are a key factor in keeping them trapped in poverty, says Anna Ross, the director of the Indian Education Department for the Minneapolis Public School District. I met Ross at the Anishinabe Academy, just a few blocks from Little Earth. It's one of half a dozen public schools focused on teaching students with Native American backgrounds. There are no posters with blonde, blue-eyed children at this elementary school. Instead, most of the children depicted in teaching materials have dark skin and long, black hair. In one of the halls, Ross points to laminated banners on the wall with seven words: humility, bravery, love, truth, respect, honesty, wisdom. These are the seven \"grandfather teachings\" that the Ojibwe, or Chippewa, live by, she explained, and they are reflected in the curriculum.\n\nRoss leads me to one of the preschool classes for 4-year-old children. One is an immersion class taught in Ojibwe, which is spoken by tribes from Minnesota to Canada. Another class is taught in the Lakota language. In the Ojibwe classroom, children sit in a circle around their teacher, who holds up different-colored cards. \"How do you say 'brown' in Ojibwe?\" she asks. They answer, tentatively. Part of the point of teaching youth from a Native American perspective is to give them confidence in themselves and pride in their history and culture. \"For science class, we might talk about wild ricing and the impact on the environment,\" Ross says, referring to a common farming practice in the Native American prairie tribes.\n\nFor Native Americans to break the cycle of poverty, Ross says, they need to see the value of education, and to see themselves positively portrayed in their school curriculum. Her department provides two-day trainings for teachers who want to learn more about how to incorporate a Native American view into their classes and field trips.\n\nOn-time graduation rates for Native American students have gone up from 24 percent in 2011 to 36 percent in 2015, but that's still quite low. In the Twin Cities, they are the racial group least likely to graduate on time. Ross says Native Americans associate public education with a degree of trauma, since to many of them, decades-long efforts to force them to enroll in federally-arranged boarding schools seemed intent on erasing their culture. Ross, who is a Turtle Mountain Ojibwe, says her grandmother was taken to one of those boarding schools as a child. \"There's a lot of anxiety still, so it's no wonder why some Natives might not be so engaged in their children's education,\" says Ross. \"People say, 'It's history' and 'get over it,' but it wasn't that long ago.\"\n\nWhile Minneapolis has made great strides in addressing the needs of America's poorest race, it seems that the country, as a whole, has forgotten about the first Americans. So many people in the Phillips neighborhood spoke to me about feeling invisible, as they're so often left out of conversations related to blacks, Latinos, Asians and other minority groups. Even so, they dismiss the depictions of Native Americans as a \" vanishing race \"-after all, decades of federal policies aimed at assimilating Native Americans have failed to make them disappear.\n\nThis article is part of our Next America: Communities project, which is supported by a grant from Emerson Collective.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

      "text": "Return the National Parks to the Tribes\n\nThe jewels of America's landscape should belong to America's original peoples.\n\nListen to more stories on audm\n\nEditor's note: This article is part of a new series called \" Who Owns America's Wilderness? \"\n\nThis article was published online on April 12, 2021.\n\nIn 1851, members of a California state militia called the Mariposa Battalion became the first white men to lay eyes on Yosemite Valley. The group was largely made up of miners. They had been scouring the western slopes of the Sierra when they happened upon the granite valley that Native peoples had long referred to as \"the place of a gaping mouth.\" Lafayette Bunnell, a physician attached to the militia, found himself awestruck. \"None but those who have visited this most wonderful valley, can even imagine the feelings with which I looked upon the view,\" he later wrote. \"A peculiar exalted sensation seemed to fill my whole being, and I found my eyes in tears.\" Many of those who have followed in Bunnell's footsteps over the past 170 years, walking alongside the Merced River or gazing upon the god-rock of El Capitan, have been similarly struck by the sense that they were in the presence of the divine.\n\nThe Mariposa Battalion had come to Yosemite to kill Indians. Yosemite's Miwok tribes, like many of California's Native peoples, were obstructing a frenzy of extraction brought on by the Gold Rush. And whatever Bunnell's fine sentiments about nature, he made his contempt for these \"overgrown, vicious children\" plain:\n\nWhen the roughly 200 men of the Mariposa Battalion marched into Yosemite, armed with rifles, they did not find the Miwok eager for battle. While the Miwok hid, the militiamen sought to starve them into submission by burning their food stores, souring the valley's air with the smell of scorched acorns. On one particularly bloody day, some of the men came upon an inhabited village outside the valley, surprising the Miwok there. They used embers from the tribe's own campfires to set the wigwams aflame and shot at the villagers indiscriminately as they fled, murdering 23 of them. By the time the militia's campaign ended, many of the Miwok who survived had been driven from Yosemite, their homeland for millennia, and forced onto reservations.\n\nThirty-nine years later, Yosemite became the fifth national park. (Yellowstone, which was granted that status in 1872, was the first.) The parks were intended to be natural cathedrals: protected landscapes where people could worship the sublime. They offer Americans the thrill of looking back over their shoulder at a world without humans or technology. Many visit them to find something that exists outside or beyond us, to experience an awesome sense of scale, to contemplate our smallness and our ephemerality. It was for this reason that John Muir, the father of modern conservationism, advocated for the parks' creation.\n\nFrom the August 1897 issue: John Muir's \"The American Forests\"\n\nMore than a century ago, in the pages of this magazine , Muir described the entire American continent as a wild garden \"favored above all the other wild parks and gardens of the globe.\" But in truth, the North American continent has not been a wilderness for at least 15,000 years: Many of the landscapes that became national parks had been shaped by Native peoples for millennia. Forests on the Eastern Seaboard looked plentiful to white settlers because American Indians had strategically burned them to increase the amount of forage for moose and deer and woodland caribou. Yosemite Valley's sublime landscape was likewise tended by Native peoples; the acorns that fed the Miwok came from black oaks long cultivated by the tribe. The idea of a virgin American wilderness-an Eden untouched by humans and devoid of sin-is an illusion.\n\nThe national parks are sometimes called \"America's best idea,\" and there is much to recommend them. They are indeed awesome places, worthy of reverence and preservation, as Native Americans like me would be the first to tell you. But all of them were founded on land that was once ours, and many were created only after we were removed, forcibly, sometimes by an invading army and other times following a treaty we'd signed under duress. When describing the simultaneous creation of the parks and Native American reservations, the Oglala Lakota spiritual leader Black Elk noted darkly that the United States \"made little islands for us and other little islands for the four-leggeds, and always these islands are becoming smaller.\"\n\nMany of the negotiations that enabled the creation of these islands took place in English (to the disadvantage of the tribes), when the tribes faced annihilation or had been weakened by disease or starvation (to the disadvantage of the tribes), or with bad faith on the part of the government (to the disadvantage of the tribes). The treaties that resulted, according to the U.S. Constitution, are the \"supreme Law of the Land.\" Yet even despite their cruel terms, few were honored. Native American claims and rights were ignored or chipped away.\n\nThe American story of \"the Indian\" is one of staggering loss. Some estimates put the original Indigenous population of what would become the contiguous United States between 5 million and 15 million at the time of first contact. By 1890, around the time America began creating national parks in earnest, roughly 250,000 Native people were still alive. In 1491, Native people controlled all of the 2.4 billion acres that would become the United States. Now we control about 56 million acres, or roughly 2 percent.\n\nRead: The Blackfeet brain drain\n\nAnd yet we remain, and some of us have stayed stubbornly near the parks, preserving our attachment to them. Grand Canyon National Park encloses much of the Havasupai Tribe and its reservation. Pipe Spring National Monument sits entirely inside the 120,000-acre Kaibab Paiute Indian Reservation, in northern Arizona. Many other parks neighbor Native communities. But while the parks may be near us, and of us, they are not ours.\n\nWe live in a time of historical reconsideration, as more and more people recognize that the sins of the past still haunt the present. For Native Americans, there can be no better remedy for the theft of land than land. And for us, no lands are as spiritually significant as the national parks. They should be returned to us. Indians should tend-and protect and preserve-these favored gardens again.\n\nListen and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | Google Podcasts\n\nIn July 2020, I conducted something of a barnstorming tour. I wanted to look with fresh eyes at the park system, to imagine a new future for it. I had planned on visiting all sorts of places-the Grand Canyon, Yosemite, Great Smoky Mountains National Park-but the coronavirus pandemic intervened.\n\nSome parks closed completely, while others (like Yellowstone) closed campgrounds, cultural centers, and museums. In the end I drove from Minnesota through North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, and Oregon and down the spine of California. Then I turned around and drove back. I visited Theodore Roosevelt National Park, Little Bighorn Battlefield, Yellowstone, Grand Teton, Mount Hood National Forest, Kings Canyon, Death Valley, and Joshua Tree.\n\nCheck out more from this issue and find your next story to read.\n\nThe roads were quieter than usual, though the skies were sometimes hazy as the West Coast burst into flames. I slept in campgrounds, in my tent in the backyards of friends, and, rarely, in a hotel or motor lodge. I cooked on the trunk of my car and on picnic tables, under the blazing sun and in torrential rain. I fought off raccoons and squirrels.\n\nMore than any other place I visited, Yellowstone seemed to contain the multitudes of America. There, I saw elk and bison. I saw enough recreational vehicles to house a good portion of this country's homeless. I saw lake water, river water, black water, swamp water, and frothy waterfall water. I saw Tony Hawk being stopped by two park rangers after longboarding down the switchbacks above Mammoth Hot Springs while an actual hawk circled above him. I saw Instagram models in tiny bikinis posing in front of indifferent bison. I saw biker gangs (who seem to really enjoy parks) and gangs of toddlers (who don't seem to enjoy anything). I saw tourists, masked and unmasked. I saw placards and displays. I discovered that you can learn a lot about nature at Yellowstone, and perhaps even more about American culture. But the park's official captions give you at best a limited sense of its human history.\n\nYellowstone National Park was created about 100 years after the country was born. An 1806 expedition, part of Lewis and Clark's Corps of Discovery, passed just north of where the park is today. Later, John Colter, one of the Corps members, joined the fur trade and purportedly became the first non-Native to see its vistas. Of course, Native people had lived there for thousands of years, and at the time Colter was setting traps in the area, they still claimed Yellowstone as their home.\n\nColter traveled through the Yellowstone area and the Teton Range in the early 19th century, looking for fur. Wherever he went, he ended up in mortal conflict with Native Americans, culminating in his wounding at the hands of the Blackfeet. He hid from the tribe under a pile of driftwood and then walked for a week to safety. Over the next 60 years, trappers like him described the landscape that would become Yellowstone as an area of mud geysers, acid pools, and petrified trees.\n\nNot until 1869 did the first official expedition explore the region and confirm the mountain men's accounts. Things moved quickly after that. In 1871, Ferdinand V. Hayden led a government-sponsored survey of Yellowstone that produced reports complete with professional sketches and photographs. Based on that report, President Ulysses S. Grant signed into law the Yellowstone Act of 1872, which created America's first landscape to be \"reserved and withdrawn from settlement, occupancy, or sale ... and dedicated and set apart as a public park or pleasuring-ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people.\"\n\nGrant's declaration made trespassers of the Shoshone, Bannock, and other peoples who had called the parkland home for centuries. The tribes left with the understanding that they would retain hunting rights in the park, as guaranteed by an 1868 treaty. Before the century was out, however, the government had reneged on that promise. This tactic of theft by broken treaty would become a pattern where parks were concerned.\n\nWhen Yellowstone was established, the Plains Wars were raging all around the park's borders. It was as though the government paused mid-murder to plant a tree in the victims' backyard. The Dakota War had erupted 10 years earlier, just east of the Great Plains. By the time it was over, dozens of Dakota had been hanged, and more than 1,600 women, children, and elders had been sent to a concentration camp at Fort Snelling . Eventually, all of the treaties between the Eastern Dakota and the U.S. government were \"abrogated and annulled.\"\n\nRead: 'Kill every buffalo you can! Every buffalo dead is an Indian gone'\n\nIn 1864, on the Plains' opposite edge, at Sand Creek in Colorado Territory, Colonel John Chivington massacred and mutilated as many as 500 Native Americans . In 1868, just four years before the creation of Yellowstone, Native Americans, led by Red Cloud, fought the U.S. government to a standstill, then forced concessions from the Americans at the treaty table, though these, too, were eventually unmade.\n\nWar came to Yellowstone itself in 1877 . Chief Joseph's band of Nez Perce had been shut out of their homeland in the Wallowa Valley and embarked on a 1,500-mile journey that would end just south of the Canadian border, where they would surrender to the U.S. Army. The Nez Perce did their best to avoid white people on their way. But they were attacked on the banks of the Big Hole River, in August 1877, by soldiers in Colonel John Gibbon's command. Gibbon's men approached the camp on foot at dawn, killing a man during their advance. Then they began firing into the tepees of the sleeping Nez Perce, killing men, women, and children. The Nez Perce counterattacked. Their warriors kept Gibbon's soldiers pinned down while the others escaped. Although they defended themselves well, they lost at least 60 people.\n\nReeling from these deaths, the Nez Perce passed into Yellowstone, where they ran into tourists from Radersburg, Montana, enjoying the \"pleasuring-ground\" created at the expense of Indians. The Nez Perce briefly held the tourists hostage, and then released them, but went on to kill two tourists in the park later in the month.\n\nMoving east through the park, the tribe forded the Yellowstone River at a place still known as the Nez Perce Ford. Around the time they crossed the river , an elderly woman peeled away from the main column and stayed at an area known as Mud Volcano. She sat on a bison robe near a geyser and sang. When a U.S. scout approached her, she closed her eyes. \"She seemed rather disappointed,\" John W. Redington, the scout, wrote, \"when instead of shooting her I refilled her water bottle. She made signs that she had been forsaken by her people, and wanted to die.\" Ten minutes later, a Bannock scout for the Army obliged by striking her down and scalping her. One hundred and forty-three years later, my sons and daughter and I would stand on the same spot, wondering why there are so few places in the park where you can learn about its bloody past. Viewed from the perspective of history, Yellowstone is a crime scene.\n\nAmerica's national parks comprise only a small fraction of the land stolen from Native Americans, but they loom large in the broader story of our dispossession. Most of the major national parks are in the western United States. So, too, are most Native American tribes, owing to the Indian Removal Act of 1830, which attempted to eject all tribes east of the Mississippi to what was then Indian Territory. The reservation period likewise began, for the most part, in the West, in the mid-19th century.\n\nFrom the May 2020 issue: The people who profited off the Trail of Tears\n\nEven after we were relegated to reservations, the betrayals continued. Beginning in 1887, the Dawes Act (also known as the General Allotment Act) split much of the reservations up into small parcels of land to be granted to individual Indians, while the \"surplus\" communal land was opened for white settlement. In blunt terms, Thomas Morgan, the commissioner of Indian affairs, said in 1890 that the goal of federal policy at the time was \"to break up reservations, destroy tribal relations, settle Indians upon their own homesteads, incorporate them into the national life, and deal with them not as nations or tribes or bands, but as individual citizens.\" This land grab bled at least another 90 million acres away from the tribes-roughly equivalent to the 85 million acres that comprise America's 423 national-park sites.\n\nAfter Yellowstone was established and Indians were removed and in some cases excluded from its spaces, the same-and worse-happened elsewhere. The Blackfeet, living in three bands in northwestern Montana and southern Alberta, had long thought of the Rockies as their spiritual and physical homeland. They wouldn't have dreamt of ceding it at the treaty table, but in the 1880s and '90s, they were forced to negotiate with the U.S. government. Weakened by a string of epidemics, seasons of starvation, and insatiable Americans bent on opening up their homelands to timber and mineral extraction, the Blackfeet had to make concession after concession. Some years, they had to give up land just to secure enough resources to last through the next winter.\n\nNot long after a harsh winter that killed as many as 600 Blackfeet, the tribe signed away land that would become Glacier National Park. The deal was brokered by George Bird Grinnell, the naturalist founder of the Audubon Society of New York. Grinnell had joined George Armstrong Custer on his expedition into the Black Hills in 1874 in search of gold. The trip was in direct violation of the treaty guaranteeing that the Black Hills would remain in Native control. Grinnell was often called a \"friend of the Indian,\" but he once wrote that Natives have \"the mind of a child in the body of an adult.\" In 1911, a year after Congress approved the creation of Glacier, Montana ceded jurisdiction of the park to the U.S. government.\n\nRead: How much are America's national parks worth?\n\nSo many of the parks owe their existence to heists like these. Apostle Islands National Lakeshore, in Wisconsin, was created out of Ojibwe homelands; the Havasupai lost much of their land when Grand Canyon National Park was established; the creation of Olympic National Park, in Washington, prevented Quinault tribal members from exercising their treaty rights within its boundaries; and Everglades National Park was created on Seminole land that the tribe depended on for food. The list goes on.\n\nI set out on my trip through America's national parks from my home, at Leech Lake Reservation, in Minnesota, on the southern fringe of the North American boreal forest. This forest is one of the largest stretches of woodland in the world: It spreads from the Aleutian Islands all the way to Newfoundland and from near the southern edge of Hudson Bay to northern Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. As I headed west for Theodore Roosevelt National Park, in North Dakota, the taiga gave way to grasslands and oak savanna near Detroit Lakes, Minnesota. By the time I crossed the Red River, I'd left the forest behind altogether. I felt the land dip, and looking west, I thought I could make out the horizon where the Great Plains begin.\n\nAs a boy, I would accompany my father on business trips through some of these same landscapes. In the car, he would narrate the history of our region, mostly without much emotional inflection: \"Chief Little Crow fled this way to escape the military after the Dakota War in 1862.\" We would pass many small towns-Hawley, Valley City, Medina, Steele-that seemed pleasant enough, until my father ruined them for me. The calm and order of them, their small houses and neatly kept yards, the Protestant ethic reflected in their organization-all of it infuriates me, because every single one of those towns exists at our expense.\n\nMedora, North Dakota, is the southern gateway to Theodore Roosevelt National Park. (The Marquis de Morès named the town after his wife, Medora von Hoffman, though the romance of the gesture suffers when you consider that he established the town as a place to slaughter cattle to be sold at eastern markets.) Medora today is a fantasy of a time that never was. There is a statue of Roosevelt and a Rough Riders Hotel and, during the summer months, the Medora Musical. The show's website really says it best when it promises \"the rootin'-tootinest, boot-scootinest show in all the Midwest. There's no other show quite like it. It's an ode to patriotism, Theodore Roosevelt, and the Great American West!\" When I was there it was an ode to COVID‐19: According to a clerk at the convenience store, one of the cast members was spreading the virus from the stage.\n\nI wanted to begin my journey at Theodore Roosevelt because no one embodies the tensions of the park system as it is currently constituted like the 26th president. Contained in the person of Roosevelt was a wild love for natural vistas and a propensity for violent imperialism; an overwhelming desire for freedom and a readiness to take it away from other people. Much of the park named after him exists on top of Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara (MHA) land. The MHA lost that land in 1851, with the signing of the first Treaty of Fort Laramie. Executive orders in 1870 and 1880 seized still more of the tribes' homeland.\n\nRoosevelt went to hunt bison in Dakota Territory in 1883. In 1884, when he was back home in New York, his wife gave birth to their daughter, Alice, but unbeknownst to her doctors, his wife had a kidney ailment, and died on Valentine's Day that year. Teddy's mother died the same day in the same house. After drawing a large X in his diary, Roosevelt wrote, \" The light has gone out of my life. \" He returned to the West and built a ranch outside Medora, intent on letting nature soothe him. He didn't last long out there, and the West never became his permanent home, but it left a mark on him-and he, in turn, left his mark on it.\n\nFrom the May 1906 issue: Camping with President Theodore Roosevelt\n\nRoosevelt was familiar with Native Americans, having interacted with them when he was in Dakota Territory. \"The most vicious cowboy has more moral principle than the average Indian,\" he would say in an 1886 speech, during which he also famously declared: \"I don't go so far as to think that the only good Indians are the dead Indians, but I believe nine out of every 10 are, and I shouldn't like to inquire too closely into the case of the tenth.\"\n\nRoosevelt's attitude toward Indians is manifest in his treatment of the Apache leader Geronimo. Born in 1829, Geronimo lived the first three decades of his life in the peace and security of his Apache homelands, in what is now New Mexico and Arizona. In the second half of the 19th century, he rose to international fame for fighting the American and Mexican governments in an attempt to preserve his tribe's piece of the Southwest.\n\nIn 1858-the year of Roosevelt's birth-Geronimo joined a large trading party that left the Mogollon Mountains and entered Mexico. While he was in town conducting business, his band was attacked and slaughtered at camp. Among the dead were Geronimo's wife, mother, and three small children. He later recalled, \"I did not pray, nor did I resolve to do anything in particular, for I had no purpose left.\" Life, for him, as recounted by Gilbert King in Smithsonian magazine , shaded from peace into a state of perpetual warfare, ending only with his capture by U.S. forces in 1886, around the time Roosevelt was mourning in Dakota Territory.\n\nGeronimo was shipped east and spent the rest of his life in captivity, and his tribe's land was whittled away. Around the same time, Native children were also being shipped away from their homelands, to government-sponsored boarding schools -removed from their families and their culture so as to mainstream them. Attendance was sometimes mandated by law and sometimes coerced, but it was rarely strictly voluntary. For speaking in their own language, the children were sometimes beaten or had soap put in their mouths. Of the 112 Apache children from Geronimo's band sent to the Carlisle Indian Industrial School, in Pennsylvania, 36 died-most of them likely from tuberculosis-and were buried there.\n\nFrom the October 2020 issue: \"My Industrial Work,\" a poem written in 1914 by an anonymous student at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School\n\nFor his part, Geronimo did get out (under guard) once in a while, including a stint in 1904 as part of the \"Apache Village\" at the St. Louis World's Fair, where he was made to play the role of the savage. In 1905, he and other Native leaders were asked to be part of Roosevelt's inaugural parade. It was a who's who of tribal leadership, including Quanah Parker (Comanche), Buckskin Charlie (Ute), Hollow Horn Bear (Brulé Lakota), American Horse (Oglala Lakota), and Little Plume (Piegan Blackfeet). They rode horses down Pennsylvania Avenue in regalia not entirely in step with their individual tribal traditions. America liked and still likes its Indians to function much like its nature: frozen in time; outside history; the antithesis, or at best the outer limit, of humanity and civilization.\n\nGeronimo met with Roosevelt afterward. \"Take the ropes from our hands,\" he begged, in a desperate appeal to be allowed to return, along with other Apache prisoners, to his homeland. Roosevelt declined, telling him, \"You killed many of my people; you burned villages.\" Geronimo began to gesture and yell but was cut off. Four years later, he died in captivity at Fort Sill, Oklahoma.\n\nIn 1903, Roosevelt had let himself be drawn back west. In April of that year he embarked on a 14,000-mile train journey that took him through 24 states and territories in nine weeks. He traveled to Yellowstone, the Grand Canyon, and California, where he enjoyed a three-night camping trip with John Muir.\n\nAlong the way, Roosevelt gave speeches-at the Grand Canyon; at Yellowstone, where he laid the cornerstone for the Roosevelt Arch; near some redwoods in Santa Cruz. He said much about the majesty of nature. Regarding the Grand Canyon: \"I want to ask you to do one thing in connection with it in your own interest and in the interest of the country-to keep this great wonder of nature as it now is ... I hope you will not have a building of any kind, not a summer cottage, a hotel or anything else, to mar the wonderful grandeur, the sublimity, the great loneliness and beauty of the canyon.\" And Yellowstone: \"The Yellowstone Park is something absolutely unique in the world, so far as I know ... The scheme of its preservation is noteworthy in its essential democracy ... This Park was created, and is now administered, for the benefit and enjoyment of the people.\"\n\nRoosevelt translated his passions into policy. During his time in office, he created 150 national forests, 18 national monuments, five national parks, four national game preserves, and 51 bird \"reservations.\"\n\nLike Geronimo, Roosevelt came of age during a pivotal 50-year stretch when the contiguous United States assumed its final dimensions. The last major armed conflict between a Native tribe and the U.S. government ended at Wounded Knee Creek with the massacre of as many as 300 men, women, and children of Spotted Elk's band of Miniconjou. The frontier was pushed all the way to the Pacific and then was no more, and America's truly wild space-land outside the embrace of \"civilization\"-was subsumed.\n\nThe American West began with war but concluded with parks.\n\nThe MHA Nation lives just north and a little east of Theodore Roosevelt National Park, but under drastically different circumstances than the people in and around Medora. Time and again, the MHA reservation was reduced by federal fiat and exploitative deals-from more than 12 million acres to less than 1 million. The dispossessions continued well into the 20th century: During construction of the Garrison Dam and Reservoir on the Missouri River in the 1940s and '50s, up to 80 percent of the reservation population was forced to relocate away from the fertile river bottoms that had given them life and defined them as a people for centuries.\n\nIn the 1860s, long before the dam was built, the MHA had lived mostly at a place called Like-a-Fishhook Village, Royce Young Wolf, the collections manager at a new cultural center the MHA are building, told me. \"It's all under the lake now, flooded out,\" she said. We were standing at Oxbow Overlook inside the park, looking down at the Little Missouri River as it wound lazily through acres of cottonwood and grassy clearings. \"They were self-sufficient,\" she said. \"Each village had its own garden. Many families had sacred bundle-keepers.\" The dam was planned without any meaningful consultation of the MHA Nation; after the Army Corps of Engineers threatened to confiscate the land it needed, citing eminent domain, the tribes had little choice but to come to the negotiating table and eventually cede territory. By 1949, they had received settlements totaling only $12.6 million for the more than 150,000 acres that were taken.\n\n\"They moved us from where water was plentiful to where there wasn't any,\" Young Wolf said. \"Our river bottoms were the most fertile in the whole state ... But when we were flooded, we were moved to areas where there's poor soil and no water and we couldn't sustain large gardens.\" The tribes' rights to use the land on the reservoir's shoreline-for hunting or fishing or plant-gathering-were denied.\n\nIn recent years, the MHA have been in the grip of rapid, violent, and remunerative fracking enterprises . As I drove north from the park, I saw land bearing scars-pipes, gas vents, and fracking pads dotting the hills. In 2014, the former tribal chair Tex Hall promised the tribes \"sovereignty by the barrel,\" and he wasn't wrong: The tribes are wealthier than they have been since before the first Treaty of Fort Laramie. But by encouraging and facilitating oil extraction, they put themselves at odds with their own cultural legacy and connection to the land.\n\nNative American nations such as the MHA are in a difficult position. They have endured state-sponsored assaults on their families, communities, land, and ways of life. Their traditional political structures and institutions have suffered under the paternalism of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, which controls Native land by holding it in trust .\n\nOn one hand, we are sovereign nations with our own laws and law enforcement, courts, and municipal infrastructures, all derived from those rights that we have managed to retain. Contrary to popular myth, neither casinos nor the right to gamble were \"given\" to tribes as a kind of pity payment or as the recognition of a debt owed us. The casino industry is the modern expression of a civil right to gamble that we had before white people came along, a right we have retained and that was affirmed by the Supreme Court.\n\nRead: One way to help Native Americans: Property rights\n\nOn the other hand, without a strong tax base or much commerce-extractive industries, casino gambling, and tax-free cigarette sales are notable exceptions-we are dependent on federal support for education, health care, infrastructure, and our continued survival. We are, in the words of Chief Justice John Marshall, \"domestic dependent nations,\" and thus live in constant tension.\n\nThe MHA have had their struggles-with unemployment, substance abuse, a destructive marriage to the oil-and-gas industry, and intergenerational trauma inflicted by the U.S. government. But tribes are much more than the sum of their troubles. The MHA are also keenly protective of their heritage and culture. The cultural center they are constructing is a state-of-the-art facility in service to these ideals.\n\nThe MHA Interpretive Center is on Army Corps of Engineers land because that land is near the river, which is so essential to MHA history, Delphine Baker, the director of the Interpretive Center, told me. She was instantly recognizable to me as a kind of fierce, no-nonsense Native auntie. Government officials didn't want the tribes to own that land, she said matter-of-factly-the tribes now hold a lease instead-out of a concern that the tribes would take control of recreation rights and not allow nontribal members to have access. \"The tribe never is interested in blocking access. But, you know, that's a fear.\"\n\nThe facility is gorgeous-swooping embankments and curving walks mirror the rolling hills and grasslands of the MHA tribal area. Inside is a partial replica of an earth lodge, the traditional dwelling of the three tribes, and gallery space that tells the story of the MHA. The Interpretive Center will be the home for hundreds, if not thousands, of artifacts taken from the tribes over the years. And it will not be merely a show-and-tell kind of endeavor. The center will cultivate traditional plants on a rooftop garden. A café will serve traditional foods. There is a recording studio for preserving tribal languages, and a research space where tribal members will be able to trace their lineage. For so many Native people who have been separated from their tribes because of federal meddling, reconnecting is an important service the center can provide. To call this an Interpretive Center isn't quite right. It is more like a cultural mothership.\n\n\"If you lose your culture, you lose your sovereignty and your tribe,\" Baker told me. \"And that's what we're fighting against.\"\n\nIt is not the first such fight. During the early reservation period, a difficult and fractious time when the people at Like-a-Fishhook Village were trying to figure out a new way of living, a splinter group wanted to hunt and garden in the old communal ways. So they left, relocating outside the reservation, about 120 miles upriver. \"That group became known as the Xoshga, and they were led by Crow Flies High and Bobtail Bull,\" Young Wolf told me. \"When they separated, they were taking a stand against assimilation and Christianity. They stayed away for over 20 years.\" They revived ceremonies and songs and dances. They preserved knowledge of local plants. While they were gone, Young Wolf said, the community at Like-a-Fishhook Village suffered from being split apart into small plots of land. But the Xoshga \"kept our traditions safe while they were away. And it's because of them we have many of our traditions today.\"\n\nIn 1894, the government forced the Xoshga back to the reservation. They were treated badly at first by many of the MHA members who had stayed behind, Young Wolf told me. They were looked at as backward and savage. But now, to be Xoshga is to be connected to the land, to tradition, and to a spirit of resistance. The Xoshga were saved by the land, and their return to it saved their tribe.\n\nThe first \"park person\" I met on my trip was Grant Geis, then the chief ranger at Theodore Roosevelt National Park (he has since retired). Geis is tall and broad-shouldered, with a rugged face and large, strong hands. He'd been at the park since 1998, when he started as a seasonal employee. \"As soon as I hit Painted Canyon ... I fell in love with it,\" he told me, \"and [I've] kind of been here ever since.\"\n\nPretty much every person I talked with in the Park Service used the word love to describe the parks, the vistas, and their own roles as protectors of the land and its visitors. In my experience, that's not a word most government employees use when talking about their job. I asked Geis about Teddy Roosevelt and his legacy. \"He was a firm believer in the land of many uses, but at the same time trying to save something for future generations,\" Geis replied. \"It says something about his character when he was forward-thinking to that degree.\" He also acknowledged Roosevelt's imperfections and expressed support for cooperative relationships between parks and adjacent tribes.\n\nThe personal failings of people like Roosevelt are still codified in American policy. A lack of access to land-and the lack of power that such access would confer-undergirds the social ills that affect many Native peoples. But, at least in some places, American attitudes are changing. And in the parks, policies are changing too, albeit slowly, and in piecemeal fashion.\n\nWhen I was a kid and my parents took my two siblings and me on our first trip out West, in the early '80s, we stopped at Theodore Roosevelt, Custer Battlefield (now Little Bighorn), Yellowstone, and Grand Teton. Indians were barely mentioned on the signage, and I don't remember meeting any Native rangers or even sensing that we existed as anything other than America's past tense. But since the passage of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, in 1990, tribes and parks (not to mention museums, galleries, and private collections) have drawn closer together in their efforts to preserve Native spaces and objects. Many tribes now have historic-preservation officers, who work with the parks.\n\nLand use itself is also changing within the parks, to some degree. For instance, the Park Service has made it easier for Native people to harvest plants for traditional purposes, though typically they first have to submit a written request. And some parks allow us to hunt or trap within their borders.\n\nIn some respects, ours is an era of Native resurgence. For all we have suffered, there remain 574 federally recognized tribes in the United States. When the first national parks were created at the end of the 19th century, only about 250,000 Native people were left in the U.S. Now there are more than 5 million Native Americans throughout the country, roughly equal to the number of Jewish Americans and millions more than the number of Muslim Americans.\n\nOur survival hasn't mattered only to us: As the efforts to assimilate us largely failed and we remained, mostly, in our homelands, Americans have gradually assimilated to our cultures, our worldview, and our modes of connecting to nature. The parks enshrine places, but they also emphasize and prioritize a particular way of interacting with the land. In the nation's mythic past, the wilderness may have been a dangerous environment, something to be tamed, plowed under, cut down. But that way of relating to the land is no longer in vogue. For many Americans, our wild spaces are a solace, a refuge-cathedrals indeed. America has succeeded in becoming more Indian over the past 245 years rather than the other way around.\n\nIt took me a few days to hike the South Unit of Theodore Roosevelt. Unlike more congested parks such as Yellowstone and Yosemite, Roosevelt is quiet, so much so that it feels like a secret. I started in high, red, dusty hills, and descended through a series of washes and dry river bottoms. I keenly felt how far back in time I was traveling with each step. The trail rose past the petrified tree stumps of a swamp millions of years old and out onto a grassy plain, where the wind screamed through the grass, echinacea, aster, and goldenrod. I passed near cliffs where the tribes might once have funneled stampeding bison, causing them to fall to the hard earth below.\n\nThe day after I finished my hike, I had breakfast with Wendy Ross, the park superintendent, in Theodore's Dining Room at the Rough Riders Hotel. I asked her whether Native people should be able to use the park differently than non-Natives, considering our longer tenure on the land, which had originally been part of the MHA's tribal homeland. Why, I asked, couldn't the MHA hunt the bison in the park? Ross said it was something of a slippery slope. If the park allowed Native people to hunt bison, the rest of the residents of North Dakota would throw a fit and, more troubling, the efforts of hunting groups to open up parks across the country to sport hunting would be greatly encouraged.\n\n\"The problem,\" Ross said, is that \"there are no protocols\" nationally, and hence there's much confusion. \"Here at Roosevelt, I've told all of my staff: We let anybody in who says they're coming in for ceremonial or spiritual purposes.\" I have no doubt this is true. Ross seems to be a good leader and an ally to the tribes who live near Roosevelt. She spoke of reparations, of \"providing what you can to people who used to use that area all the time, and then expanding that to other Native peoples.\" She has been attending tribal meetings. Superintendents like Ross are changing the parks to better meet the needs of Native nations, but they can do only so much. So far, reparations are partial, ad hoc, and tenuous-always subject to reversal.\n\nNative people need permanent, unencumbered access to our homelands-in order to strengthen us and our communities, and to undo some of the damage of the preceding centuries. Being Native is not so much a disposition or having a certain amount of blood running through one's veins as it is a practice around which families and tribes are built. For a member of the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes, buying a bison burger at Whole Foods might satisfy their caloric needs, but being able to hunt and harvest bison, in keeping with their spiritual and cultural practices, feeds their culture and community. Native life was diminished when our land disappeared beneath our feet, and it is further diminished when the manner in which we access \"public\" lands is scripted by the government.\n\nThe preservation of these sublime places for future generations is of course crucially important, something Native Americans understand as deeply as anyone. But putting aside for a moment the interests of Native Americans-and notwithstanding the hard work and goodwill of many park employees-the parks show worrying signs of mismanagement. Myopic decisions have seemed to proliferate, and some protected natural spaces have become political footballs. Bears Ears National Monument, in southeastern Utah, was signed into being by President Barack Obama before he left office. One year later, President Donald Trump reduced Bears Ears by 85 percent, from 1.4 million acres to just over 200,000. This move left archaeological and sacred sites at the mercy of mining operations and motor vehicles. And while it is likely to be reversed by the Biden administration, possibly quite soon, it augurs poorly for the future.\n\nAlthough the Department of the Interior will soon benefit from the leadership of Deb Haaland, who recently became the first Native American Cabinet secretary, it has typically lacked for innovation in recent years. As Jeff Ruch, a director of the nonprofit Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, has written, \" most parks merely 'Xerox forward' old plans, adjusting as they go. \" Most of this is done without fresh thinking on conservation, development, and access.\n\nNational parks are withering as a result of overcrowding, habitat loss, and what Ruch calls a \"science deficit.\" Even as attendance has increased, park staff has been shrinking, as has the influence of scientists within the Park Service. Ruch's assessment doesn't make the Park Service sound like the protective arm of a powerful government safeguarding its \"best idea.\"\n\nParks, as they've existed for 149 years, have done a decent job of preserving the past. But it's not clear that today's model of care and custodianship best meets the needs of the land, Native people, or the general public. Nor is it clear that the current system will adequately ensure the parks' future. That's something Indians are good at: pushing ahead while bringing the past along with us. We may be able to chart a better way forward.\n\nAll 85 million acres of national-park sites should be turned over to a consortium of federally recognized tribes in the United States. (A few areas run by the National Park Service, such as the National Mall, would be excepted.) The total acreage would not quite make up for the General Allotment Act, which robbed us of 90 million acres, but it would ensure that we have unfettered access to our tribal homelands. And it would restore dignity that was rightfully ours. To be entrusted with the stewardship of America's most precious landscapes would be a deeply meaningful form of restitution. Alongside the feelings of awe that Americans experience while contemplating the god-rock of Yosemite and other places like it, we could take inspiration in having done right by one another.\n\nPlacing these lands under collective Native control would be good not just for Natives, but for the parks as well. In addition to our deep and abiding reverence for wild spaces, tribes have a long history of administering to widely dispersed holdings and dealing with layers of bureaucracy. Many reservations are checkerboarded: Large parcels of reservation land are scattered and separated from one another. And much of the land within reservation boundaries is owned by a number of different interests-private, nontribal citizens; corporations; states; the federal government-that tribal leadership balances and accommodates. Through hard practice-and in the face of centuries of legal, political, and physical struggle-Indian communities have become adept at the art of governance. And tribes have a hard-earned understanding of the ways in which land empowers the people it sustains.\n\nTransferring the parks to the tribes would protect them from partisan back-and-forth in Washington. And the transfer should be subject to binding covenants guaranteeing a standard of conservation that is at least as stringent as what the park system enforces today, so that the parks' ecological health would be preserved-and improved-long into the future. The federal government should continue to offer some financial support for park maintenance, in order to keep fees low for visitors, and the tribes would continue to allow universal access to the parks in perpetuity. Bikers and toddlers, Instagram models and Tony Hawk-all would be welcome. We would govern these beautiful places for ourselves, but also for all Americans.\n\nThere is precedent for this kind of transfer. The indigenous peoples of Australia and New Zealand now control some of those countries' most significant natural landmarks. For instance: Uluru, previously called Ayers Rock, was transferred to the Anangu decades ago. Thanks to legislation passed in 1976, nearly half of the Northern Territory of Australia has been returned to Aboriginal peoples. In 2017, New Zealand's Māori were granted a greater role in the conservation of the Whanganui River, on New Zealand's North Island. The public is still free to visit as before, but the Māori now have more oversight of the use of the river.\n\nThere is a precedent for this kind of transfer in America, too. In 1880, France began work on the Panama Canal, which the United States took over in 1904. Theodore Roosevelt (he keeps coming up) wanted to see it through, and so he worked out a deal with Panamanian nationalists, whereby the U.S. would receive the canal in exchange for help overthrowing the Colombian government. But in 1977, President Jimmy Carter and General Omar Torrijos of Panama signed an agreement that outlined the transfer of control of the canal to Panama. The canal was jointly managed by the two countries until 1999, when control reverted fully and finally to Panama. It doesn't happen often, but the United States has given things back.\n\nIn 1914, the historian Frederick Jackson Turner argued that American democracy was forged on the frontier . It was there that the uniquely American mixture of egalitarianism, self-reliance, and individualism commingled to form the nation and its character. \"American democracy,\" he said, \"was born of no theorist's dream ... It came out of the American forest, and it gained new strength each time it touched a new frontier.\"\n\nTurner was almost right. It wasn't the frontier that made us as much as the land itself, land that has always been Native land but that has also come to be American. The national parks are the closest thing America has to sacred lands, and like the frontier of old, they can help forge our democracy anew. More than just America's \"best idea,\" the parks are the best of America, the jewels of its landscape. It's time they were returned to America's original peoples."

      "text": "Death by Civilization\n\nThousands of Native American children were forced to attend boarding schools created to strip them of their culture. My mother was one of them.\n\nMy mother died while surviving civilization. Although she outlived a traumatic childhood immersed in its teachings, she carried the pain of those lessons for her entire life. Like most Native American peoples, our family's story is touched by the legacy of boarding schools , institutions created to destroy and vilify Native culture, language, family, and spirituality. My mother, Bernice, was a survivor of Saint Mary's Catholic Indian Boarding School on the Ojibwe reservation in Odanah, Wisconsin. She called it the \"Sister School,\" a world ruled by nuns clad in long black robes.\n\nTwo hundred years ago, on March 3, 1819, the Civilization Fund Act ushered in an era of assimilationist policies, leading to the Indian boarding-school era , which lasted from 1860 to 1978. The act directly spurred the creation of the schools by putting forward the notion that Native culture and language were to blame for what was deemed the country's \"Indian problem .\"\n\nNative families were coerced by the federal government and Catholic Church officials into sending their children to live and attend classes at boarding schools. (About one-third of the 357 known Indian boarding schools were managed by various Christian denominations.) According to the Act's text, Christian missionaries and other \" persons of good moral character \" were charged with introducing Native children to \"the habits and arts of civilization\" while encouraging them to abandon their traditional languages, cultures, and practices.\n\nThis is what achieving civilization looked like in practice: Students were stripped of all things associated with Native life. Their long hair, a source of pride for many Native peoples, was cut short, usually into identical bowl haircuts. They exchanged traditional clothing for uniforms, and embarked on a life influenced by strict military-style regimentation. Students were physically punished for speaking their Native languages. Contact with family and community members was discouraged or forbidden altogether. Survivors have described a culture of pervasive physical and sexual abuse at the schools. Food and medical attention were often scarce; many students died. Their parents sometimes learned of their death only after they had been buried in school cemeteries, some of which were unmarked.\n\nWhen my mother was alive, I would often interrogate her about her life at the Sister School. Annoyed, she would demand, \"Why do you always have to go poking?\" And so I've spent much of my personal life and professional work as a journalist trying to uncover and investigate all that happened to her and thousands of others at Indian boarding schools.\n\nFor reasons I still don't completely understand, I am consumed by the need to validate and prove, intellectually and emotionally, her experiences at the Sister School. I crave confirmation because I believe it will somehow reinforce my mother's stories in the face of generations of federal and Church denials of their role in the boarding schools' brutality. It will say to me: You're not making this up. This really did happen .\n\nAs this country marks the bicentennial of the Civilization Fund Act, I think of the traumatic impact of my mother's time at Saint Mary's and, in turn, the effect that her dysfunctional survival strategies had on our family.\n\nAlthough she died in 2011, I can still see her trying to outrun her invisible demons. She would walk across the floor of our house, sometimes for hours, desperately shaking her head from side to side to keep the persistent awful memories from entering. She would flap and wring her hands over and over again, as though to rid them of a clinging presence.\n\nShe was lost to our family during these times. We guarded her with our tensed stomach muscles, trying to help her battle the unknown demons. Eventually she would wind herself down. Sometimes, even laughing a bit in relief, she'd mutter, \"Settle down, you crazy old chicken,\" before collapsing on her bed.\n\nHypervigilance, defensiveness, resentment, and a hair-trigger temper had been her only allies against the Sister School messages of racial inferiority, daily reminders that Natives were primitive beings unlikely to rise above the role of servants in a white man's world. She raged against the nuns' label \"dirty Indian,\" haunted by the fear that the nuns were right, even as she scrubbed miles of floors and performed hours of heavy manual labor.\n\nAll of those awful Sister School doings cut her mind. I think she believed that she would break into 1 million pieces if she recalled the traumatic events that held her hostage, forever burned into her amygdala.\n\nI remember a summer day, one of many, when I made my mother toast and brought her aspirin in her dark bedroom, where she was bedridden with a migraine. I placed my offerings on the little table next to her bed, and retreated back to my hiding place under the kitchen table.\n\nAfter a while, she called to me. I found her lying in the dark, with one arm thrown over her eyes; the other arm was open for me. Silently, I climbed onto the bed, fitting myself into her armpit and gazing at the tiny blue Virgin Mary medal pinned to her brassiere, a hidden remnant of her boarding-school days. I remember the bedspread, stiff from its time drying outside on the clothesline and fragrant with fresh air and my mother's scent. She would spend hours washing the laundry \"white, white\" like the Sisters had taught her, rushing up and down the cellar steps with baskets of heavy, wet sheets. \"We may be Indian, but by God we ain't dirty,\" she'd say while hanging laundry on the line.\n\nI remember her deep voice that wrapped a cocoon around us in the bedroom as she, like she had done hundreds of times before, told me her Sister School stories. There was the \"evil\" nun Sister Catherine, Mother Superior Sister Catherine of the Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration, who was the principal of the boarding school she had attended.\n\nAs she described the nun's inexplicable cruelty-the beatings, the shaming, and the withholding of food-I snuggled closer to her in anticipation. Then the mood of her story lifted, and I remember how her voice took on the conspiratorial tone that I loved.\n\n\"One year during the Christmas season, Sister was marching down the cellar steps to check if we stole any food,\" she said. \"She fell on the bottom step- crash ! She hit her head bad! Not long after, she died.\"\n\n\"What a silent cheer us kids made!\" she continued. \"Maybe it was terrible, but it was the best Christmas present we ever got!\" I remember how she clasped her hands together and how, for a few moments, we shared a little girl's wicked happiness.\n\nI still marvel at her ability to reinvent and protect her sanity with what I now assume were fantasies in which good always triumphed over evil.\n\nIn 2015, my questions led me to the special-collections library at Marquette University in Milwaukee, where a trove of records from the Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions is stored. Carefully preserved and tended, the documents lie in climate-controlled archival luxury. I made a special appointment with the archivist weeks in advance to examine them.\n\nOn the day I went, I was the sole visitor in the huge reading room. I sat at one of the enormous tables and opened the first of many boxes. To my great disappointment, it contained photocopies of lists of students' names at the various Catholic boarding schools that once dotted Indian country. I'd hoped to see the original documents, and to find my mother's report cards or documents describing her time at Saint Mary's.\n\nEventually I came across the names of my mother and her siblings, the ink faded, written in careful cursive. I sat back heavily in my chair and breathed an exasperated sigh; her life at the school and all that happened there was represented by only her name written on a long, nondescript list of other students.\n\nWhen the archivist arrived, he explained that even the original collection, full of yellowing documents instead of photocopies, held very little personal information about any of the students who had attended the schools so long ago. He explained that the original documents were largely administrative, but that I could view them if I liked.\n\nI'd come this far, so I said yes.\n\nHe brought out another cartload of cardboard file boxes. Beyond the lists of student names with check marks in columns indicating whether they'd graduated, run away, or died, the boxes contained mostly bureaucratic reports and correspondence between generations of boarding-school principals and the Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions in Washington, D.C, the agency that oversaw the boarding schools.\n\nThere was nothing in the dry letters and reports concerning the people I wanted to learn about, such as Sister Catherine or my mother. I thought about calling it a day. But for a moment there in the silent room, I distinctly heard my mother whisper my name, Mary! Her tone had a familiar ring, like when she'd demand me to \"get down on those prayer bones, girl!\" when I scrubbed the floor.\n\nSo I continued my search, and I found documents relating to Saint Mary's, including a yellowed, typewritten letter dated January 3, 1934. It was addressed to the Right Reverend Monsignor William Ketcham, the director of the Bureau of Catholic Indian Missions, from Sister Mary Macaria, the Sister secretary of Saint Mary's.\n\nIt read in part:\n\nBy the time these lines reach you, our dear Mother Superior Sister Catherine will, no doubt, have been called to her eternal reward. On December 19, she fell off the second last step leading down to the kitchen entry.\n\nShe must have pitched forward with great force, for in striking her head against a windowsill; a gash was cut in her forehead by the temple of her glasses. On Friday Dec. 29, the Sister nurse noticed a change in Sister's condition and told us she feared a stroke.\n\nOur dear sister had convulsions, was anointed and has been speechless since. The doctor says it can hardly be but a matter of a day or so at most if she does linger even that long.\n\nWe know you will pray earnestly for her eternal repose and for a speedy relief from her sufferings. Sorrowfully yours in the agonizing Heart of Jesus.\n\nSister Macaria\n\nWhen I got to the end of the letter, I stood straight up out of my chair. I recovered myself and sat back down; I concentrated on the contents of the box again. To my amazement, I found an original photo of Sister Catherine. Covered from head to toe in her black-and-white nun's habit, she gazed sternly into the distance through her thick, wire-rimmed glasses.\n\nThe room was air-conditioned, but I was sweating as I read the remaining documents in the Saint Mary's file. At last, I held tangible proof  that her stories were true.\n\nCorroborating even part of her story vindicated her wounded life. It gave me authority over our family's mysterious, shameful secret, in which the punishment for being Native was a humiliation we could never overcome. How many other Native families could find some comfort in the information in these obscure archives?\n\nAs the United States marks the anniversary of the Civilization Fund Act and all the devastation it set into motion, the federal government and Christian churches have an opportunity to begin a new chapter in their relationship with Native peoples.\n\nHealing is possible. Canada, which operated hundreds of Indian residential schools with similar assimilationist agendas, implemented the Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement in 2007, in which the government formally apologized to former boarding-school students and paid reparations to survivors. And in 2009, Canada created the (now-defunct) Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which began a multiyear process of collecting and listening to survivors' stories, opening up residential-school records to survivors and families, and ensuring that the history and legacy of the schools are never forgotten.\n\nAccording to residential-school survivors I interviewed in Canada , the public admission of wrongdoing from churches and the government, as well as the opportunity to meet other survivors, meant far more to them than reparations or public displays of reconciliation. Two sisters from the Lac Seul band of Ojibwe shrugged their shoulders in response to my questions about what the future holds for government promises to improve indigenous relations. \"I buried my anger for 20 years; I blocked it out,\" said one sister, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation from her non-Native neighbors. \"But listening to others talk about their experience helped me make a new start and get over my bad feelings.\"\n\nSenator Murray Sinclair, Canada's second-ever indigenous judge, who chaired Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission and presented its official findings in 2015, described the impact of allowing survivors to tell their stories to me this way: \"They were not subject to cross-examination as if on trial. They were invited to share what they had to share, no more, no less. Their stories were recorded into history, and at the end of each day, they were acknowledged.\"\n\nAs of now, apologies in the United States have been few and far between. Although President Barack Obama signed the Native American Apology Resolution on December 19, 2009, apologizing for past \"ill-conceived policies toward the Native peoples of this land,\" the resolution had no impact on federal policy toward Native Americans. With its disclaimer against any legal claims, the resolution faded into the woodwork of legislative paperwork.\n\nStatutes of limitations for civil or criminal cases make any legal action impossible in the United States, according to the Native American Rights Fund attorney Donald Wharton. Lawsuits against Christian denominations would need to take place in individual state courts, and would likely be costly and burdensome. Attempts at gaining reparations at the state-legislature level have failed, too; in February, the South Dakota legislature killed a bill that would have extended the window for childhood survivors of boarding-school abuse to file suits against organizations such as the Catholic Church.\n\nIn addition to an admission of its role in the boarding-school programs, the government could make records from the time more easily available to survivors and their families. Telling the truth won't change the facts of all that happened or the damage that was done. It would, however, offer thousands of Native peoples the solace of physical evidence and validation like the kind I got, which could guide a path toward healing."

      "text": "The Schools That Tried-But Failed-to Make Native Americans Obsolete\n\n\"Education was something that was done to us, not something that was provided for us.\"\n\nTwo centuries ago, Congress passed a law that kicked into high gear the U.S. government's campaign to assimilate Native Americans to Western culture-to figuratively \"kill the Indian,\" as one general later put it , and \"save the man.\"\n\nThe Civilization Fund Act of 1819, passed 200 years ago this week, had the purported goal of infusing the country's indigenous people with \"good moral character\" and vocational skills. The law tasked Christian missions and the federal government with teaching young indigenous Americans subjects ranging from reading to math, eventually leading to a network of boarding schools designed to carry out this charge. The act was, in effect, an effort to stamp out America's original cultural identity and replace it with one that Europeans had, not long before, imported to the continent. Over time, countless Native American children were taken from their families and homelands and placed in faraway boarding schools, a process that was often traumatic and degrading .\n\nThe Civilization Fund Act stressed that the boarding schools were only to enroll Native students whose families gave their consent. But as the novelist and historian David Treuer notes in his latest book, The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee: Native America From 1890 to the Presen t , government workers often coerced Native parents through police seizures and threats. Many others surrendered their kids to these institutions simply because they lacked a better alternative-perhaps they were so destitute that the schools, where child labor and malnourishment were rampant , felt like an improvement. It wasn't until the late 1970s that Congress outlawed the forced removal of Native children from their families. \"The full effect of the boarding school system wouldn't be understood until decades after the agenda of 'civilizing the savage' ground down,\" writes Treuer, a member of the Minnesota Chippewa Tribe's Ojibwe band who was raised largely on the Leech Lake Indian Reservation.\n\nTreuer sees The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee as an antidote to the sort of modern-day writing on indigenous America that he argues relies on pitiful \"poverty porn\" or romanticized stereotypes of Native Americans. I recently spoke with Treuer about harmful depictions of indigenous people, the legacy of the Civilization Fund Act 200 years later, and 21st-century Native America. An edited and condensed transcript of that conversation follows.\n\nAlia Wong: You write about how Native Americans have often been dismissed as an afterthought in conceptions of the United States' identity. But you also point to the recent uptick in mainstream attention on and advocacy for their causes, much of which highlights the efforts, over the years, to force assimilation. Against this backdrop, what does it mean to you to be a citizen of the United States-an \"American,\" if you will-today?\n\nDavid Treuer: Well, that very question is under assault, and [these debates] are evocative of American Indian history, I think. People tend to read American Indian history as a sideshow to American history; it's treated, at least in schools today, as a breakout unit that one trots out around Thanksgiving, in November.\n\nBut American Indian history is part and parcel of American history: In what became known as America's first revolutionary act, colonists dressed up as Mohawk Indians and then dumped tea in the Boston Harbor. America has since understood itself as being on the frontier, the advancing edge of global civilization, largely by experimenting and leveraging its unique set of resources. That experiment was conducted in the laboratory of the American landscape, which included us [Native people].\n\nWhile America has always been engaged in a kind of civil war with itself over the fundamental nature of our country, [this dissonance] is perhaps most clearly seen in relation to the American Indian populations. Are we going to be a country where a person goes to get rich, or are we going to be a country that empowers and emboldens and supports its more vulnerable citizens? What kind of force in the world do we want to be?\n\nRead: Native American youth are spearheading a renaissance\n\nWong: What vestiges of the Civilization Fund Act are still apparent today, and what lessons do you hope the present-day United States takes away from that policy?\n\nTreuer: Education was something that was done to us, not something that was provided for us. And the boarding schools are a great example of that: They were a means by which the government was trying to destroy tribes by destroying families. This is partly why education is such a tricky thing for Native people today. How are you supposed to go to school and learn about Mount Rushmore yet know that each person promoted the killing of Indian people ? How are you supposed to say the Pledge of Allegiance to a country that was trying to kill and dispossess you and caused the horrible suffering of your parents and grandparents? How are you supposed to learn in an education system of which your ancestors grew deeply distrustful, and then be told we have to work hard at school to get ahead?\n\nI can speak to this conflict autobiographically. When I was a kid, I remember a teacher on a school trip to the [Minnesota] capitol scowling at a group of Native American activists who were protesting, and saying, \"All those Indians are just a drag on welfare; they should just go back to Canada, where they're from.\" I wasn't the only Indian in class-and that was my high-school teacher .\n\nThings are starting to change, but the changes are long overdue. And those changes trace back to the boarding schools: In many ways the plan succeeded, but in many ways it didn't, because of various unintended consequences. For example, it took all these Native kids from different tribes who previously knew nothing about, or had been habitual enemies with, each other and put them in schools to suffer together. As a result, when they left school and went back to their homelands to promote the welfare of their individual tribes, they were armed with a network of other like-minded, educated people on whom they could rely. So, in this sense, the policy inadvertently strengthened tribes.\n\nToday the vestiges remain in that many Natives are suffering. But as a Native person, I know that for every kid you find, say, standing in a pile of garbage , there are 20, 30, 50, 100 other kids selling Girl Scout cookies or going to tennis lessons or doing their homework or competing on the math team or getting excited about prom-often while also going to ceremony , for example, and speaking Lakota and engaging in other cultural customs. They're living their lives-they're not just exhibiting their pain.\n\nRead: Native American education is changing-subtly\n\nWong: How are Native youth today living their lives differently than their predecessors in your generation and from the generations subjected to the boarding schools?\n\nTreuer: When I was in college, Princeton was in the process of hiring someone to teach American Indian studies and was debating what role that academic would have. I remember a faculty member turned to me and said, \"You can either be a university professor or a medicine man-you can't be both.\" I remember being so upset, thinking, Who in the hell do you think you are to tell me what is possible? But he was expressing a long-held belief that you could be Indian or you could be American, that you could be Indian-which is to say the past -or you could be modern , which meant educated. And as much as I rejected this professor's comment, it was an uneasy rejection.\n\nNow I look at today's kids-I look at my own children, other people's children-and there doesn't seem to be any tension in being Native and being modern. To them, being Native is not merely or only to be of the past, or to suffer, or to be a victim, or to be less than ideal Americans. They're happily modern and Native at the same time; they happily switch between things like Fortnite and [tribal] ceremony and don't see any contradiction between the two. Native kids today are way smarter and better off than I was."

      "text": "A Native American Declaration of Independence\n\nThe revolutionary fervor of the Northeastern Seaboard was not limited to the European colonists.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nOn November 7, 1785, a group of Native American families gathered in a farmhouse near present-day Deansboro, New York-about 15 miles southwest of Utica-and established a new nation, the first American republic to be founded in the aftermath of the Revolutionary War.\n\nThe families derived from seven tribes along the Northeastern Seaboard: Narragansett, Niantic, Groton Pequot, Stonington Pequot, Tunxis, Montauk, and Mohegan. They were united by a common Algonquian language, shared traditions, and a desire to distance themselves from the colonial chaos of their coastal homelands. Their founding moment was recorded in the diary of one of the group's leaders, a minister from the Mohegan nation named Samson Occom. \"Now we proceeded to form into a Body Politick,\" he wrote. \"We Named our Town by the Name of Brotherton, in Indian Eeyawquittoowauconnuck.\" The tribe established a governing committee to be reelected yearly, appointed various officials, and commenced the business of self-government. Soon after, their counterparts in Philadelphia started doing the same under their new federal Constitution.\n\nOne of these foundings eventually became much more famous than the other. But as a historian and teacher of early-American culture and politics, I've found that knowing about both can upend some common misconceptions concerning the Revolutionary era. The United States founding was undoubtedly a momentous event in world history, but it happened on a continent where other communities were seeking independence at the same time. If the Revolutionary era marked a \"birth of freedom,\" per President Abraham Lincoln's famous metaphor, then the United States was not the only baby in the delivery ward.\n\nBrothertown and the United States were born less than a decade apart and, by 1800, readily acknowledged each other's sovereignty. As the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) later put it, the Brothertown founders had created a \"tribal political entity,\" and the federal government \"recognized a relationship between that entity and the United States.\" Today, the Brothertown Indian Nation still abides by its founding traditions. It still has a tribal council and a judiciary, the Peacemakers, which settles disputes under the Brothertown constitution. Brothertown citizens celebrate November 7 as the founding day of their national autonomy, much as U.S. citizens celebrate July 4, 1776. The tribe also has officers and cultural institutions for communicating with outsiders, including academics like me. When I was researching my book about Occom, I emailed a tribal historian and was invited to attend a book club on Brothertown history that I still go to most Wednesdays.\n\nJeffrey Rosen: The Founders' guide to happiness\n\nOnly after several years of conversation with my friends there did I start to wrap my mind around the significance of a Native American founding in the Revolutionary Northeast. This is partly because of the way historians typically periodize the American story, with the founding era bookended by the pre-1776 \"colonial period\" (as if this had ever ended) and the early republic, a schema that makes the U.S. government the only relevant actor. But it's also because non-Native Americans tend to assume that the history of Native nations must stretch back into the mists of precolonial time. Native people aren't supposed to \"found\" their nations, and certainly not in 1785. Those nations are supposed to be passed down, from generation to generation, and get interrupted by upstarts like the United States.\n\nBrothertown defies these expectations of Indigenous otherness. But here's the crucial point: That doesn't mean that Brothertown, which was created as a refuge from colonialism, ever wanted to emulate Great Britain or the United States. To be sure, Brothertown and the United States were born around the same time and, as members of the same political \"generation,\" share certain traits. But the Brothertown founders created their \"Body Politick\" to solve very different problems from those the American Revolutionaries faced.\n\nLet's start by considering what the U.S. Declaration of Independence was for. As the historian David Armitage has argued , its main purpose was to get the United States recognized as a sovereign state in the sphere of international law. In 1776, the colonial rebels required two things to win their war against their mother country: military allies and access to credit. They could expect neither so long as Great Britain was sovereign over them. Hence the need for the 13 colonies \"to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them.\"\n\nThis kind of rhetoric is almost entirely absent from the proclamations, treaties, and laws enacted by the Brothertown Nation in the first half century of its existence. Declaring independence, for Brothertown, didn't require appealing to some international tribunal or the \" opinions of mankind .\" It was primarily about creating a new home: a political space where tribal members could self-govern and settle disputes.\n\nThat's not to say the Brothertown founders lacked a foreign policy. Diplomacy, after all, was a major part of Native life, and had been since long before the arrival of Europeans. In the 150 years or so leading up to the establishment of Brothertown, Northeastern tribes had developed a complex web of relationships with the British Crown. Sometimes diplomacy was a matter of straightforward treaty-making, sovereign to sovereign. Occasionally, tribes affirmed allegiance to Great Britain, but this was almost always done provisionally: \"upon condition of His Majesties' royal protection, and righting us of what wrong[s] us, or may be done unto us,\" as one Narragansett declaration from 1643 put it. The advantage of acknowledging the jurisdiction of a distant monarch was that it gave the tribes legal standing equal to (or better than) that of colonists. Being \"subjects unto the same King\" in the years before the American Revolution, as the historian Jenny Hale Pulsipher has shown, was typically better than squaring off directly against colonial greed and malice. From this point of view, the Revolution was a disaster for Native people, because it deprived them of one of their most effective legal strategies.\n\nEven so, the tribes of the Northeastern Seaboard expressed little nostalgia for the British after their defeat. Although Brothertown's parent tribes sometimes benefited from the protection of the British sovereign, they never aspired to full participation in the commonwealth. Nor did they see themselves as bound by \"social contracts\" of the kind theorized by European philosophers. Among tribal nations, political allegiances were fluid. A sachem (an Algonquian term for \"chief\") who betrayed the interest of his tribe could easily find himself rejected by his people. This was what happened in the 1760s and '70s, when the Mohegan sachem Ben Uncas III oversaw the leasing of tribal lands, allegedly in collusion with the governing assembly of Connecticut Colony. In a petition to the Crown's appointed governor, the tribal council declared that \"the English intend to Continue him as a Sachem over us, but we have a Law and a Custom to make a Sachem over us Without the help of any People or Nation in the World, and When he makes himself unworthy of his Station we put him down-ourselves.\"\n\nEven though the Mohegans said it was \"a Law and a Custom\" to live this way, by U.S. standards, their concept of sovereignty was remarkably nonlegalistic-in a way that's worth appreciating at this time of year, especially, when U.S. citizens traditionally celebrate their republic's founding documents. Today, we understand the United States Constitution as the \"supreme law of the land\" as ratified through official public procedures. But in the 18th century, the term constitution more commonly referred to a whole way of life, as in the \"ancient constitution\" sometimes described as the unwritten source of English law. Tribal constitutions were described in similar terms ; having a sachem who sold out the tribe was unconstitutional in the sense of being incompatible with the Mohegan way of life. Native constitutions were culturally embedded to a degree that the U.S. Constitution, which was purpose-built to govern a society of factions \" actuated by different sentiments and views ,\" wasn't.\n\nHistorians are finally beginning to confront the hard fact that the U.S. Constitution rules over Native nations as a kind of imperial law . This is ironic, given the \"anti-colonial\" ambitions of the U.S. rebels against British rule. Arguably, however, the \"constitution of American colonialism\" (to borrow a phrase from the legal scholar Maggie Blackhawk) has more in common with the imperial law of ancient Rome than that of early modern Britain. Like Roman imperial law, U.S. law since the 1970s has allowed for the flourishing of multiple \" sub-political groups ,\" each with its own national culture, under its sovereign jurisdiction. Like Rome, too, the U.S. has turned the determination of Native nationhood into a question of imperial administration. Today, the BIA, a division of the Department of the Interior within the executive branch, gets to decide which Native tribes are \"sovereign\" from the perspective of federal law-regardless, in many cases, of what tribes say about themselves.\n\nKelli Mosteller: For Native Americans, land is more than just the ground beneath their feet\n\nThe case of Brothertown is instructive here. The U.S. dealt with Brothertown as a sovereign tribal nation until 1839, when an act of Congress granted the tribe's members U.S. citizenship while declaring that \"their power of making or executing their own laws, usages, or customs, as such tribe, shall cease.\" (Note how Congress denied Brothertown's power to make \"customs\" as well as \"laws,\" which seems to acknowledge the cultural embeddedness of tribal sovereignty, even as it denies tribal sovereignty with an authority transcending culture.) Then, in the late 20th century, Brothertown appealed to BIA to get its federal recognition reinstated, arguing that the 1839 act didn't really \"terminate\" the tribe's sovereignty. Over successive presidential administrations, BIA went back and forth on the question, deciding most recently (in 2012) that Brothertown had, in fact, been congressionally terminated. The nation's sovereignty under federal law now hinges on whether Congress can be persuaded to reverse its 19th-century mistake.\n\nBrothertown is doing everything it can to get its recognition restored , one of many tasks that make up the daily business of tribal government. Like other Native Americans, the people of Brothertown are fighting for sovereignty in the context of an empire that claims a monopoly over the meaning of Native nationhood. The persistence of Brothertown, from the Revolutionary period to today, shows that claim to be false. Brothertown declared its independence in 1785, and it's been independent ever since."

      "text": "Disease Has Never Been Just Disease for Native Americans\n\nNative communities' vulnerability to epidemics is not a historical accident, but a direct result of oppressive policies and ongoing colonialism.\n\nAs the death toll from COVID-19 mounts, people of color are clearly at greater risk than others. Among the most vulnerable are Native Americans. To understand how dire the COVID-19 situation is becoming for these communities, consider the situation unfolding for the Navajo Nation, a people with homelands in Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah. As of April 23, 1,360 infections and 52 deaths had been reported among the Navajo Reservation's 170,000 people , a mortality rate of 30 per 100,000. Only six states have a higher per capita toll .\n\nThe spread of COVID-19 is reminiscent of previous disease outbreaks that have ravaged Native American communities. Many of those outbreaks resulted in catastrophic loss of life, far greater than even the worst-case scenarios for COVID-19. Even the 1918-19 flu pandemic, in which an estimated 650,000 Americans died (0.6 percent of the 1920 population of 106 million), pales in comparison to the losses Native Americans have suffered from disease.\n\nRead: How the pandemic will end\n\nUntil recently, histories of disease and Native Americans have emphasized \"virgin-soil epidemics.\" According to this theory, popularized in Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel , when Europeans arrived in the Western Hemisphere, they brought diseases (particularly measles and smallpox) that indigenous people had never experienced. Because they had no immunity to these diseases, so the theory goes, the resulting epidemics took the lives of 70 percent or more of the Native population throughout the Americas .\n\nNew research, however, provides a much more complicated picture of disease in American Indian history. This research shows that virgin-soil epidemics were not as common as previously believed and shifts the focus to how diseases repeatedly attacked Native communities in the decades and centuries after Europeans first arrived. Post-contact diseases were crippling not so much because indigenous people lacked immunity, but because the conditions created by European and U.S. colonialism made Native communities vulnerable. The virgin-soil-epidemic hypothesis was valuable in countering earlier theories that attributed Native American population decline to racial inferiority, but its singular emphasis on biological difference implied that population collapses were nothing more than historical accidents. By stressing the importance of social conditions created by human decisions and actions, the new scholarship provides a far more disturbing picture. It also helps us understand the problems facing Native communities today as they battle the novel coronavirus.\n\nVirgin-soil epidemics undoubtedly occurred. In 1633, for example, a smallpox epidemic struck Native communities in New England, reducing the Mohegan and Pequot populations from a combined total of 16,000 to just 3,000. The epidemic spread to the Haudenosaunee in New York, but no farther west than that. Smallpox did not hit communities in the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes until 1756-57, a century or more after initial contact with Europeans. When it did, it was because Native fighters, recruited to fight for the French against the British during the Seven Years' War, had contracted the virus in the east and infected their communities when they returned home. Lack of immunity mattered, but it was the disruption resulting from war that promoted smallpox's spread.\n\nRead: How disease and conquest carved a new planetary landscape\n\nSmallpox did not arrive in the Southeast until 1696, a century and a half after the Hernando de Soto expedition. It was once thought that de Soto's men carried smallpox, but this view reflected the flawed assumption that Europeans were always infected with smallpox and always contagious. De Soto's expedition did cause disease to erupt in Native communities, but the reason was that the expedition's violent warfare led to outbreaks of pathogens such as dysentery, which was already present in the Americas. When smallpox finally hit the Southeast, it spread rapidly from Virginia to East Texas across networks created by an English trade in Native captives for enslavement in their coastal and West Indies colonies. Raiding, capturing, and transporting human bodies created pathways for the smallpox virus. To make matters worse, those bodies were already weakened by war and its companions-malnutrition, exposure, and lack of palliative care.\n\nBy the end of the 18th century, most Native communities in what would eventually become the United States had been exposed to smallpox. Nevertheless, as smallpox recurred in the 19th century, its impact correlated not with a lack of prior exposure, but with the presence of adverse social conditions. These same conditions would also make Native communities susceptible to a host of other diseases, including cholera, typhus, malaria, dysentery, tuberculosis, scrofula, and alcoholism. Native vulnerability had-and has-nothing to do with racial inferiority or, since those initial incidents, lack of immunity; rather, it has everything to do with concrete policies pursued by the United States government, its states, and its citizens.\n\nConsider the impact of the Indian Removal Act. Formally adopted in 1830, this policy called for the relocation of Native peoples east of the Mississippi River to \"Indian Territory\" (what would eventually become Oklahoma and Kansas). Most everyone has heard of the Cherokee Trail of Tears, but it is seldom considered a U.S.-caused health crisis. The expulsion of the Cherokee from their homeland in Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee had three phases. In the first, the U.S. Army forcibly evicted Cherokees from their homes and held them for several months in concentration camps with inadequate shelter, insufficient food, and no source of clean water. The camps became death traps. Of the 16,000 people held in them, about 2,000 died from dysentery, whooping cough, measles, and \"fevers\" (probably malaria). In the second phase, the journey west, an additional 1,500 perished, as people, already sick and further weakened by malnutrition, trauma, and exposure, succumbed to multiple pathogens. In the months after reaching Oklahoma-the third phase-an additional 500 died from similar causes. The death toll was 4,000, or 25 percent of the original 16,000 forced from their homes.\n\nAlthough the Cherokee Trail of Tears is the most well known, there were dozens of other such forced removals. Creeks, Seminoles, Chickasaws, Choctaws, Senecas, Wyandots, Potawatomis, Sauks and Mesquakies, Ojibwes, Ottawas, Miamis, Kickapoos, Poncas, Modocs, Kalapuyas, and Takelmas represent only a partial list of nations that suffered trails of tears. Not all experienced the same mortality as the Cherokee, but many did, and for some, the toll was even higher. The allied Sauks and Mesquakies were forced to move four times from their villages in western Illinois-once to central Iowa, once to western Iowa, once to Kansas, and finally to Oklahoma. In 1832, the time of the first expulsion, the Sauks and Mesquakies numbered 6,000. By 1869, when they were finally sent to Oklahoma, their population was only 900, a staggering loss of 85 percent. Year after year, unrelenting diseases, including an outbreak of smallpox in 1851, took many lives. Low fertility and infant mortality, the result of malnutrition, sickness, and trauma, hindered population replacement. The Sauk and Mesquakie catastrophe was not an accident. It was a direct and foreseeable consequence of decisions made by the United States and its citizens to dispossess Native people of desirable lands and shove them someplace else.\n\nRead: The people who profited off of the Trail of Tears\n\nNavajos (Dinés, as they refer to themselves in their language) were also evicted from their homelands. In the winter of 1863-64, the U.S. Army pursued scorched-earth tactics-destroying their peach trees and cornfields-to drive them to a barren reservation at Bosque Redondo, on the Pecos River in New Mexico. On the 250-mile forced march, known as the Long Walk, several hundred of the 8,000 to 9,000 Dinés died en route. Over the next four years, Dinés lost as many as 2,500 of their people to disease and starvation. In their darkest hour, though, Diné leaders successfully prevailed on government officials to release them from their prison and return home. But even though their population has grown over time, the legacies of the Long Walk remain. The Diné historian Jennifer Denetdale observes that \"severe poverty, addiction, suicide and crime on reservations all have their roots in the Long Walk.\"\n\nAs cases of COVID-19 began to appear on the Navajo Reservation in late March, tribal President Jonathan Nez spoke to his people on Facebook . Summoning memories of the Long Walk, he \"called on citizens to help one another,\" reminding them \"that's when the best came out of many of our ancestors, helping each other out, carrying the load for the elders, carrying the children for our mothers.\" \"Now it's our turn,\" he said, \"to think of our future, our children, our grandchildren.\" Ongoing colonialism makes fighting COVID-19 a challenge. Although the Navajo are a sovereign nation with resources of their own, Dinés have a high incidence of conditions -diabetes, hypertension, and lung disease-that increase their susceptibility to becoming severely ill from the coronavirus. Lack of access to clean water makes hand-washing difficult. Many people cannot afford food, hand sanitizer, and other necessities. And there is an acute shortage of hospital beds and medical personnel.\n\nMany public officials, health experts, and journalists are drawing attention to the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on communities of color. Even so, large segments of America are indifferent, if not outright hostile, to recognizing these disparities and the inequities underlying them. Native Americans are visible to the general public far more often as sports mascots than as actual communities. The Trump administration initially resisted providing any relief to tribal nations in the $2 trillion stimulus package passed in early Apr il , and although the legislation ultimately appropriated $10 billion to tribal governments , the Treasury Department, tasked with distributing these funds, has failed to disburse them. According to New Mexico Senator Tom Udall, Treasury Department officials \"don't know how to interact in the appropriate way with tribes and they're just not getting the job done.\"\n\nCountering the invisibility of Native peoples, of course, means greater awareness of how COVID-19 is affecting them and enhanced efforts to provide resources to help them combat the current outbreak. It also means creating a deeper understanding of the history of American Indians and disease. Although the virgin-soil-epidemic hypothesis may have been well intentioned, its focus on the brief, if horrific, moment of initial contact consigns disease safely to the distant past and provides colonizers with an alibi. Indigenous communities are fighting more than a virus. They are contending with the ongoing legacy of centuries of violence and dispossession."

Morgan, and visited more than 80 tribes over the next 20 years, taking more than 40,000 photographs, 10,000 wax cylinder recordings, and huge volumes of notes and sketches. The end result was a 20-volume set of books illustrated with nearly 2,000 photographs, titled \"The North American Indian.\" In the hundred-plus years since the first volume was published, Curtis's depictions have been both praised and criticized.

      "text": "The Extremely Fast Peopling of the Americas\n\nTwo genetic studies show how the first Native Americans spread through their new continent with incredible speed.\n\nTens of thousands of years ago, two gigantic ice sheets smothered the northernmost parts of what has since been named North America. They towered more than two kilometers high and contained 1.5 times as much water as Antarctica does today. They were daunting, impassable barriers to the early humans who had started moving east from Asia, walking across a land bridge that once connected the regions now known as Russia and Alaska. But once the ice started to melt, these peoples-the ancestors of the Americas' Indigenous groups-spread southward into new lands.\n\nWhat happened next?\n\nGenetic studies , based on ancient remains, had already suggested that once the first American Indians got south of the ice, 14,600 to 17,500 years ago, they split into two main branches. One stayed north, giving rise to the Algonquian-speaking peoples of Canada. The other headed south, giving rise to the widespread Clovis culture, and to Central and South Americans. That's a very rough outline, but a new study from J. Víctor Moreno-Mayar and his colleagues fleshes it out. They showed that whatever happened south of the ice, it happened fast .\n\nThey sequenced the genomes of 15 ancient humans, who came from sites ranging all the way from Alaska to Patagonia. One person from Spirit Cave in Nevada and five from Lagoa Santa in Brazil were especially instructive. They were all just over 10,000 years old, and though they lived 6,300 miles apart, they were strikingly similar in their DNA. Genetically, they were also closely matched to Anzick-1 -a famous Clovis infant from Montana, who was about 2,000 years older.\n\nAll this suggests that, about 14,000 years ago, the southern lineage of early American Indians spread through the continent with blinding speed. To picture their movements, don't think of a slowly growing tree, incrementally sending out new branches and twigs. Instead, imagine a starburst, with many rays zooming out simultaneously and rapidly.\n\nIn a matter of centuries, these people had gone down both sides of the Rockies, across the Great Basin, and into Mexico's highlands. Within a couple more millennia, they had zipped down the Andes, through the Amazon, and as far south as the continent allowed. \"Once they were south of the ice, they found a territory that was open, vast, and full of resources,\" says Moreno-Mayar, who is based at the University of Copenhagen. \"They were adept hunter-gatherers, so they expanded very quickly.\"\n\nThis pattern confirms the suspicions of archaeologists, whose finds had long suggested that humans suddenly appeared throughout the Americas, from about 13,000 years ago onward. \"You can now see that in the genetics,\" Moreno-Mayar says.\n\nCoincidentally, a second group of researchers, fronted by Cosimo Posth of the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, independently found the same pattern . They studied the DNA of 49 ancient humans from Central and South America and found similar evidence for a rapid starburst expansion, and a southward migration that connects the Clovis culture of the north to early peoples in Belize, Brazil, and Chile.\n\nThese studies show that the histories of the Americas are more complicated than earlier genetic studies suggested, says Deborah Bolnick , an anthropologist from the University of Connecticut. But that's more because those studies were overly simplistic to begin with rather than because the new results are surprising. \"Many lines of evidence, including archaeological research, linguistic data, and Indigenous histories, have suggested that multiple groups of people-related, descended from shared ancestors, but still distinct-have lived, moved, and interacted in the Americas over the millennia,\" she says. \"Broadly, that is what these [new] studies show.\"\n\nThey're not just reinventing the wheel, though. For example, the tools of the Clovis people were so different from those found at Spirit Cave (which lies on the other side of the Rockies) that some researchers took them as evidence that the Americas were peopled by two genetically distinct founding groups. Moreno-Mayar and his colleagues have disproved that idea: They showed that the two groups were genetically similar, if culturally distinct.\n\nBoth teams also found evidence of later waves of migration that took place long after the Americas had been initially peopled-although the details differ between the two studies. Posth's data point to a second wave of people who entered South America about 9,000 years ago, whose genes displaced those of the earlier Clovis-related people, and who had a direct connection to Indigenous groups today. By contrast, Moreno-Mayar's data speak to a gentler process, in which relatively small groups slowly spread both north and south from Mexico from 8,000 years ago, adding their genes to the local populations without swamping them. Either way, they \"challenge the idea that present-day native peoples all descend from a single, homogenous ancestral population,\" says Maria Nieves-Colón , a geneticist based in Mexico's LANGEBIO institute.\n\nThe two studies also differ on a particularly puzzling and controversial result. Back in 2015, the leaders of both Posth's and Moreno-Mayar's teams found that today's Indigenous Amazonians share small hints of ancestry with people from Australia and Papua New Guinea-places on the other side of the Pacific . In their new study, Moreno-Mayar's team found that same tantalizing smidgen of Australasian ancestry in the 10,400-year-old remains from Lagoa Santa in Brazil, but in none of the other remains they tested. \"Every explanation that we can come up with for that is less plausible than the last,\" says Moreno-Mayar.\n\nIf people with Australasian ancestry somehow entered the Americas before the early American Indians, how did they get into Brazil without leaving any trace in North America, either genetically or archaeologically? If they entered after the first American Indians did, how did they get from Alaska to Brazil seemingly without interacting with anyone else? If they sailed across the entire Pacific, after hypothetically inventing seafaring technology millennia before the Polynesians, how did they cross the Andes and traverse the Amazon?\n\nIt doesn't help that Posth's team didn't find any Australasian DNA among their ancient remains, including ones from the same region of Brazil. It could be that people from that area were very diverse-or that the Australasian signal is a mistake. \"The only way to get a better answer is to do more studies on other ancient samples,\" adds Moreno-Mayar.\n\nThose studies are surely coming. The analysis of DNA from ancient bones is a booming field of science, with splashy new discoveries emerging on a monthly basis. But such studies can harm Indigenous communities with ties to ancestral remains, by undermining repatriation claims and other legal disputes, damaging their identities by contradicting their histories, or increasing stigma by revealing susceptibility to disease. Despite these risks, Indigenous communities have been repeatedly shut out of research that involves their ancient relatives. The genome of the Ancient One, an 8,500-year-old skeleton found in Kennewick, Washington, was studied against the wishes of Columbia Plateau tribes , who wanted his remains repatriated and reburied. Just last year, remains were removed from Chaco Canyon without consulting any native peoples.\n\nMany Indigenous scientists and their allies have now begun pressuring their peers to seek permission from tribes before any work is done, to involve them in research, and to share results. Just this year, two manifestos outlining these practices were published in major journals. And researchers are listening. In 2015, I attended a discussion on this topic at a major genetics conference, in a mostly empty room with a few dozen people. This year, a similar session was so popular that it spilled into an overflow room-and packed that, too.\n\nThat change is becoming apparent in new published work. Posth's paper, for example, includes an ethics statement before describing the study's results. \"More than any other project I've been involved in, we paid a lot of attention to interacting with communities, curators, and local organizations,\" he tells me.\n\nMoreno-Mayar's team also took the criticisms over past missteps to heart. Before studying the 10,600-year-old mummy from Spirit Cave, Eske Willerslev, the team leader, sought permission from the Fallon Paiute-Shoshone Tribe, which had cultural affiliation with the remains. The tribe members initially refused, and Willerslev accepted their decision. But they changed their minds because they realized that a genetic study could solve the long-running legal debate regarding the remains.\n\nThe Spirit Cave mummy-a 40-something man-was found by two archaeologists in the 1940s and had been kept in a Nevada museum. The tribe wanted him repatriated; the federal government refused after some academics argued, based on the shape of his skull, that he wasn't related to contemporary American Indians. After Willerslev's analysis disproved that, the skeleton was returned to the tribe in 2016 and privately reburied. Throughout the process, members of the tribe flew to Copenhagen, oversaw the work, and-most important for Moreno-Mayar-taught the geneticists about their culture. Such steps aren't just about ticking an ethical checklist, he says, but \"about trying to understand other ways of seeing the world.\"\n\nThe team also joined forces with members of other Indigenous communities to study different sets of remains. The supplement that accompanies its paper contains letters of support. Two tribal leaders are co-authors on the paper, which represents their status as partners-in-research rather than just gatekeepers of permission. \"[The team has] made a sincere effort to connect with Indigenous communities,\" says Nieves-Colón . \"We still have a long way to go, but it's great to see the trend shifting toward ethical consultations being the norm, not the exception.\"\n\nAgustín Fuentes , an anthropologist at the University of Notre Dame, is particularly impressed with Moreno-Mayar's study, which he says shows a deeper attempt to rectify the problematic practices of the past. \"It front-ends Indigenous participation and centers it on the peoples of the Americas rather than the peopling of the Americas,\" he says. He means that the paper gives agency to the ancient individuals it describes instead of simply distilling them into abstract concepts of \"gene flow.\" It's the kind of subtle difference that reflects genuine engagement with Indigenous groups-as does the styling of the word Indigenous . \"Any object can be indigenous, but people or groups of people should be capitalized,\" says Krystal Tsosie, an American Indian geneticist at the Vanderbilt School of Medicine. \"It's a small but important detail.\"\n\nThe ethical situation is harder to parse in South America, where there are often no tribal communities who claim kinship with a given set of remains; in such cases, the two teams contacted local government officials. \"This can be problematic when government agencies are unmotivated to provide good stewardship over ancient remains, especially if their own policies toward present-day Indigenous communities are questionable,\" says Tsosie. Those communities \"don't have the same protections as the sovereign tribal nations of the United States, [and] it is up to scientists to not exploit lax policies in other countries as a means of circumventing ethical practices.\"\n\nKeolu Fox , a Native Hawaiian at the University of California, San Diego, would also prefer Indigenous scientists to take charge of this field themselves. \"We want to create some kind of infrastructure where our communities benefit from this work,\" he says. \"The new standard should be letting Indigenous people tell their own stories.\""

      "text": "How Native Americans Dodged Annihilation and Flourished\n\nThe destruction of Indian peoples' power via military and diplomatic means was a continuous project of European Americans from the very beginning of settlement in the 1620s until the surrender of Geronimo's Apaches in 1886. Four years after the Apaches put down their guns, at a place called Wounded Knee Creek in South Dakota, the U.S. Army massacred some 300 Sioux followers of the Ghost Dance-a potent religious awakening among the Great Plains Indians that provoked great fear among the authorities, for it predicted the disappearance of all the whites, and the return of the traditional Indian world, including the buffalo herds and Native ancestors who'd died resisting the invasion of Euro-Americans.\n\nWounded Knee serves as a kind of grim coda to one of the sorriest chapters in American history.\n\nAccording to David Treuer, a gifted and subtle Ojibwe writer and anthropologist who grew up on the Leech Lake Reservation in Minnesota, what lay ahead for Indians was even more tragic than what went down during the 270 years of warfare that ended in 1890. The U.S. government embarked on a badly misconceived crusade to assimilate Native communities into mainstream America. The goal of the 1886 Dawes Act (and subsequent legislation) was nothing less than the destruction of traditional Indian culture and identity.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe theory behind the Dawes Act was simple enough: The only good Indian was a white Indian. The corrupt paternalists of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and misguided missionaries from the mainline Protestant denominations presided over this malign and dehumanizing process.\n\nBy 1934, Treuer reports in his brilliant and moving new history/memoir, The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee: Native America from 1890 to the Present , tribal lands had been reduced from 138 million acres to a mere 48 million, mostly by fraud. Grinding poverty prevailed on most reservations, as did alcoholism and despair. Many anticipated that discrete Indian communities would vanish from the scene entirely in a matter of a decade or two. Somehow, however, the Indians hung on.\n\nThe Indian Reorganization Act of 1934 signaled the beginning of the end of the assimilation era. Floundering government educational and economic development programs on the reservations were revamped; financial credit was extended to the tribes. Most important, Indian communities were authorized to form their own governments and to resume long-prohibited religious practices and lifeways. In short, the Reorganization Act conferred on Indian people a certain degree of freedom to approach the task of being both Indians and Americans in their own way and time.\n\nSo began a long and very much ongoing struggle by tribal governments to break the hold of the Bureau of Indian Affairs over all matters of Indian life, and for Indians to take control over their own communities. That struggle reached its dramatic and fiery peak in the '60s and '70s, during the Indian Renaissance, when writers like N. Scott Momaday and Vine Deloria and the violent militancy of the American Indian Movement (AIM) brought the preoccupations and struggles of Indian country to the attention of mainstream America for the first time. This was the heyday of pro-Indian legislation, when Congress and the Supreme Court began to restore Indian sovereignty, and address the many injustices and crimes committed against Indians by both the federal government and the states.\n\nTreuer's discussion of AIM's impact on the quest for social justice and Indian rights is particularly compelling and fair-minded. Over the course of the late '60s and '70s, AIM, led by militants like Russell Means and Dennis Banks, seized high-profile objectives such as Alcatraz prison, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and of course, the Sioux reservation at Pine Ridge, South Dakota, site of the Wounded Knee Massacre. As the FBI and a cluster of other law enforcement agencies closed in, AIM's leaders demanded the return of all stolen Indian lands, a federal commission to investigate government treaty violations, and direct negotiations with President Richard Nixon and the secretary of state, among many other things.\n\nAIM's actions drew widespread support, especially among liberals and academics, despite its frequent resort to violence. AIM, writes Treuer,\n\n\"had begun to forge its image-that of the proud Plains warrior fighting the overwhelming forces of whiteness that sought to erase him... The leaders were obsessed with the image and given to grandstanding. Yet in the midst of the counterculture movement that co-opted so much Indian aesthetic and culture, AIM was doing one thing right: It was showing Indians around the country that they were proud of being Indian, and in the most uncomfortable way possible for the mainstream. Indians from reservations and cities alike were, for the first time, pushing back against the acculturation machine that was part of domestic America's imperial agenda, and doing it loud and proud.\"\n\nThe siege at Wounded Knee \"was both a high-water mark and a deeply disappointing action for AIM. The siege drew national attention to many of the issues that had plagued Indian country for some time: corruption, violence, lack of due process, and the importance of treaties and sovereignty.\" Yet in the end, AIM's militant approach did little to lessen the violence and poverty that plagued Pine Ridge or other reservations. Most of the demands the militants put to the federal government went unaddressed. Between 1973 and 1976 there were more than 50 homicides at Pine Ridge alone. Most were never seriously investigated.\n\nLeonard Peltier, one of AIM's genuine tough guys, engaged in a series of violent encounters with the FBI and the police in Wisconsin, Washington State, and on the Pine Ridge Reservation. In 1977 Peltier was convicted of murdering two FBI agents in a firefight at Pine Ridge. Still in prison today, Peltier is considered a political prisoner by AIM. Amnesty International lists his case in its Unfair Trials category.\n\nAs his discussion of AIM indicates, Treuer is no militant, and his book is a long, long way from a screed on the sins committed by the United States against indigenous peoples. Quite the reverse. Treuer approaches his vast subject with a kind of quiet humility, seeking to understand rather than indict. He sees nothing to be gained by Indians today adopting a stance of rage or victimhood. \"If we insist on raging against our dependency on the United States and modernity itself, we will miss something vital: As much as our past was shaped by the whims and violence of an evolving America, America, in turn, has been shaped by us.\" Better to take up a resolute defense of Indian rights, and to remember and celebrate the past than to rage against injustice and past wrongs.\n\nThe overarching theme of The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee is that, through imagination, adaptability, and sheer tenacity, Indians have not only survived many losses and wrongs, but flourished. The book is also \"an attempt to confront the ways we Indians ourselves understand our place in the world, as our self-regard-the vision and versions we hold of who we are and what we mean-matters greatly.\"\n\nIndeed, the book sparkles with insights about how Indian identity has been preserved and conveyed from generation to generation. Indian children from the cities, who live largely among whites, have been \"raised on story after story of the rez-stories about bad cars and violent sheriffs and selling blueberries or baskets or tamales or necklaces by the roadside; about five or ten or fifteen Indian people living in a shack; about one drunkscapade after another; about the foibles or idiosyncrasies of this or that elder. These stories become foundational myths, benchmarks of authenticity, even though they are all, in one way or another, stories of loss.\"\n\nPart of the magic of this book stems from Treuer's ability to move seamlessly back and forth from the Big Indian Story to the voices of living Indians explaining to us, and to themselves, what it means to be Indian, American, and both at the same time. Treuer himself, as well as his hilariously funny, pot-puffing Uncle Bobby, who still lives on the rez in Minnesota and makes a good living as a year-round hunter-gatherer (it's true!), are among the cast of characters. These sections of the text open a window on the contemporary Indian world, in its dazzling variety, and infuse the book with a kind of vividness and punch rarely found in narrative histories.\n\nAs Treuer tells it, Indian country since the New Deal has had its ups and downs, surely, but it has been on a generally upward trajectory. Population of indigenous Americans has climbed from a low of 240,000 in 1900 to 2.9 million today. Many Indian communities across the country either are, or are becoming prosperous, thanks to a new spirit of entrepreneurship that goes well beyond casinos, fishing, and logging, and to a growing Indian middle class. Corruption and factionalism among Indian leaders are certainly still problems on reservations, but they are on the decline.\n\nWhat's more, mainstream America has come to appreciate the values of Indian culture, particularly traditional Indian conceptions of the relationship between human beings and their earth they inhabit, and the importance of community and spirituality. There's a new appreciation of the contributions Indians have made in shaping both American history and the national consciousness for the better.\n\nToday, Indian values and voices offer a powerful counterpoint to the shabby consumerism, exploitation, and incivility that define American life. And the history of Indian-white relations since 1620 goes far to remind us that violence and racism have been as prominent in the American story as \"freedom and justice for all.\"\n\nThe Heartbeat of Wounded Knee is by and large a hopeful and inspiring book. And in fact, Treuer offers readers considerably more than a chronicle of Native America since 1890. The first hundred pages present a short but fascinating history of Indians up to that date. Here Treuer charts with dexterity and economy the various strategies Indians developed across North America to preserve their independence and ways of life. At the same time these hundred pages serve as a primer on Indian-white relations, describing and explaining the apparatus of conquest as practiced by the Spanish, the Dutch, and especially the English and their American descendants. The author eschews what might be called the two competing narrative tropes on this subject in favor of a more balanced version of events.\n\nThe first narrative is that the Europeans came to America fleeing tyranny, \"found\" the Indians and wanted to civilize them with the best of intentions, but there were complications. The other, more recent trope is that the Europeans came \"intent on genocide and were largely successful at it.\"\n\nTreuer sees something much more complex and ambivalent going on here, in which the best of intentions mixed with the worst. Whatever else happened, the Indians were not simply objects of conquests. They played, and continue to play, a central role in the story of North America since 1600. They \"resisted, helped, hindered, and constantly negotiated the changes wrought by colonization and dispossession.\"\n\nTreuer does not see the Indian past as a source of weakness or sorrow.  Indigenous people, he says, have every reason to look on their traditional cultures and their history of resistance and adaptation as a source of strength, a bonding agent, for the 21st century. \"Our people spent the better part of the 1960s and 1970s figuring out how to be both Americans and Indians; how to move forward into the future in such a way as to not leave the past behind; to once and forever destroy the idea that to live one kind of life meant shedding the other one; and to find some productive balance between growth and violence, between destruction and regeneration.\"\n\nIt's hard to imagine there will be a better, more compelling look at Indian country than this one anytime soon.\n\njwarrenct28@gmail.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "What the Nazis Learned From America's Indian Removal\n\nIt may seem hard for some to imagine two more disparate subjects than the U.S. removal of Native American peoples from Indian territory in the nation's Southeast during the 1830s and t he Nazi liquidation of Europe's Jews more than a hundred years later. Yet the parallels in the machinery of state expropriation, persecution, deportation, and violence that led to the expulsion of both groups from the lands ruled by their oppressors are striking.\n\nTo be sure, there were distinct differences: The U.S. was a populist democracy whose Indian policy was one of dispersal; the Third Reich was a militaristic dictatorship whose goal for the Jews was liquidation. The Americans were concerned with geography; the Germans with biology. But the nations' methods for ridding themselves of their \"alien\" elements were remarkably similar.\n\nIt is no accident that Adolf Hitler used America's policies to extirpate its Indian population as a model for his own extermination of the Jews. He equated his quest for Lebensraum in the East with America's ethnic cleansing of its Indians in the West. In addressing the Jewish problem, the Fuhrer was inspired by America's use of forced resettlement, starvation, deprivation and detention in expunging its own indigenous peoples. \"The Volga must be our Mississippi,\" he declared.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe expulsion of Native Americans from their communities in the Southeast took place in less than a decade beginning in 1830. As Claudio Saunt's new history, Unworthy Republic: The Dispossession of Native Americans and the Road to Indian Territory , recounts, the first half was relatively benign, devoted to prodding the Indians to \"relocate\" through legal chicanery and settler intimidation, warning that it was in their interests to move on before they were forced out. When this failed, the second half was informed by violence, plunder and roundups-all done by or with the sanction of the government. The indigenous peoples involved-the Cherokees, Creeks, Choctaws and Chickasaws residing within a territory bounded roughly by present-day Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi-cited treaties to no avail.\n\nAlthough Chief Justice John Marshall upheld their rights in the Supreme Court, his 1832 ruling in Worcester v. Georgia was only so much paper, as President Andrew Jackson declined to enforce it. In 1830, Donald Trump's favorite president had approved \"the Act to provide for an exchange of lands with the Indians,\" in effect a euphemism for mass deportation in the guise of paternalistic concern for the well-being of the despoiled Native Americans. The government based its expropriation on a bogus accord manipulated with the collusion of a rump group that had broken with the Cherokee nation.\n\nThe \"Trail of Tears\"-which refers to the removal of 80,000 Indians from their homelands-actually comprised a series of expulsions over several years. As Saunt writes of one of these actions: \"The four thousand children, women and men who walked to the Mississippi in November 1831 left behind their land, their houses, corncribs, farming implements, orchards and livestock.\" By way of compensation, \"95 percent of the dispossessed received nothing.\" In fact, they were made to pay for their own deportation. The Southern usurpers partnered with Northern backers who profited richly from the process of Indian removal.\n\nWhen Hitler made the Jews pay for cleaning up the damage inflicted by the Nazis after Kristallnacht, he had a ready precedent. While the Germans took malicious pleasure in tormenting their Jews, the Americans affected a concern for the Indians' well-being. Since these  \"primitive\" people could not long survive alongside the flood of \"civilized\" white settlers who were inexorably usurping their lands, the only way to protect them from their inevitable fate was to remove them. The stark choice, they were advised, was expulsion or extirpation.\n\nAcceding to the legalism that Bill of Rights protections were limited only to the actions of the federal government and not the states, Jackson allowed Georgia and its rapacious plantation-politicians to have a free hand in dispossessing the Cherokee Nation of more than four million acres of its ancestral lands despite the guarantees of a U.S. treaty now in tatters. Like the Jews of the Reich, the Cherokees were deprived of their legal status and effectively impoverished by writ of law. When sympathetic Northern congressmen vainly sought to thwart this process, legislators from Georgia took umbrage, threatening to nullify any federal efforts to impede them and, if necessary, to secede, a threat that proved unnecessary.\n\nThe fate of the Cherokees and their kindred folk was part of a larger plan to drive all of America's indigenous people's west of the Mississippi, an early paradigm for the German project to make the Reich judenrein . Both were virtually successful. By the mid-1830s only 15,000 of the original 80,000 indigenous people remained on their native soil and, after spates of vigilante violence, they'd soon by removed at bayonet point to internment camps from whence they would be marched west under armed guard.\n\nThe land that they'd been given in \"compensation\" for their fertile valleys was a bleak terrain in what would become the Oklahoma territory. At the time it was described by one Army officer as \"nothing but a barren waste, having no cultivable lands, no game, no timber.\" One thinks of the stateless Jews a century later who were dumped by Germany over the Polish border to languish in a frontier no-man's land.\n\nThe trail west was marked by privation, disease and death. The Government's ill-provisioned commissaries, rife with corruption, negligence and ineptitude, could not provide for the needs of the starving, ragged, ill-shod refugees who marched hundreds of miles through freezing weather, succumbing to cholera, exposure and malnutrition that took a particular heavy toll on the young and the weak. The refugees' route would take many of them a few miles past the Hermitage, Andrew Jackson's thousand-acre plantation which held more than 100 slaves.\n\nA contingent of ravaged Choctaws reached Memphis and Vicksburg during the worst winter storm in 50 years. From there they were packed into steamboats described as \"floating prisons.\" The last leg of their ordeal was resumed on foot until the exhausted survivors arrived at their destination. There is an eerie similarity between the sufferings endured along this fatal route and the death marches described by the Jewish survivors as the Reich imploded.\n\nMeanwhile, the white usurpers were making good use of plundered Indian land. Georgia conducted a state lottery in which 53,000 winners got to stake their claims to more than 4.2 million acres of Cherokee land, replacing the Indians with Black slaves to work the fields of cotton and other staples. There was a direct link between depopulating the region of Indians and refilling it with Black slave labor. Abolitionists pointed to the connection between plantation slavery and the deportation of native peoples, which they decried as \"doubly atrocious.\"\n\nIt is here that we arrive at a common thread in the destruction of a vulnerable minority, often unremarked on because it is hidden in plain sight: avarice. While the oppressors justified their depredations with various rationales-manifest destiny to dispense with the Indians, racial purity in regard to the Jews, security and ethnic cleansing in the case of the Armenians-a prime motivator in all these instances is a generalized envy of a minority possessed of property, wealth or status. When a sufficient animus has built up, the resentful majority will use whatever occasion arises-war, economic crisis, foreign threat-to plunder its prey.\n\nBy 1830, Cherokees lived on homesteads, went to church, published newspapers and lived alongside whites in conditions of relative prosperity. They were a diverse community, in Saunt's words, \"hunters, farmers, Catholics, Methodists, animists,\" and, like their white neighbors, a few were slaveholders as well. But in the envious eyes of the white newcomers their assimilation was of no avail-they were still defined by race. As the Cherokee leader John Ross observed, if his people were suffering it was not because of their proximity to settlers but rather due to the policies of white men \"when dictated by avarice and cupidity.\"\n\nIn Europe Against the Jews, 1880-1945 , Götz Aly cites the historian Theodore Schneider's \"multi-stage model to illustrate the transition between ethnocentric resettlement and mass murder of minorities.\" Step 1: Mandatory detention. Step 2: Pressure to emigrate. Step 3: Deportation. Step 4: Forced resettlement in occupied territories.\n\nStep 5: Physical destruction, was a bridge too far in America, although a case might be made that the annihilation of millions of indigenous people over the centuries by white invaders could amount to genocide.\n\nAly also observes that \"by distributing the belongings and property of Jewish deportees among local gentiles, the German masters made the latter complicit in their crimes, ensuring their silence.\" Consequently, when the war ended, many \"were shocked when unexpected and unwanted Jews suddenly appeared.\" Needless to say, wherever the Jews materialized, they were rebuffed with lies, resentment and violence. The desire of millions of Europeans to retain their ill-gotten gains led them to deny their complicity.\n\nWhich brings us back to what Gore Vidal called \"the United States of Amnesia.\" A generation after World War II, the Germans made an accounting with the past. A generation after the Civil War, the heirs of the Confederacy justified the rebellion with monuments and whitewashed its embrace of slavery from the picture.\n\nWhile a reckoning with the history of slavery is now belatedly coming to pass, we have yet to establish a reconciliation commission to address the despoliation of our Native Americans, which would be part of a larger undertaking to deal with this country's blemished record in treating its Asian minorities, much less the legacy of Black servitude and its consequences.\n\nSaunt writes that in 1824, prior to the Native American expulsion, Cherokee leaders had demanded their rights \"under the memorable declaration that all men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights.\" They were attempting to hold America to its own words and to appeal to the conscience of a burgeoning nation.\n\nTheir effort failed but in making it, they showed a better sense of our national purpose than the men who spurned them. It is now for history to hold a reckoning with their cause.\n\ncalmerfuture@yahoo.com\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "How 'Killers of the Flower Moon' Fails Native Americans Like Me\n\nIt's the genteel kindness of the white characters in Martin Scorsese 's new film Killers of the Flower Moon that hit me hardest. The ease with which they could both comfort and kill their Osage friends and families. The veneer of love and compassion that masked envy and a disbelief that people they deemed \"incompetent\" could live better lives than themselves.\n\nThe Osage people at the heart of the film persevered against a sustained assault and genocide. They fought to thrive in a world they did not create with rules that were not their own. And yet, they are not at the center of their own story.\n\nInstead, Killers of the Flower Moon is once again told through a white lens, despite concerted efforts by Scorsese and co-screenwriter Eric Roth to incorporate Osage voices. Osage language consultant Christopher Cote, who worked on the film, argued that it would have been better to tell the story through Mollie's ( Lily Gladstone ) eyes, but would have needed an Osage director to make that happen. Reservation Dogs star Devery Jacobs recently said that the white characters were portrayed with greater \"courtesy and depth\" than the Osage characters.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAs a citizen of the Chickasaw Nation, I couldn't agree more.\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon presents an unflinching account of greed and apathy fueled by America's thirst for oil and the progress that came with it in the early 1900s. Americans replaced their horses with cars, and their candles with electricity powered by oil that improved their lives with the conveniences we take for granted today. And it was Osage men, women, and children who paid for Americans' newfound prosperity.\n\nThe U.S. government deported the Osage people and other Native Americans from their homelands to Oklahoma in the 19th and early 20th centuries to make room for white settlers moving west. The Osage people had no choice but to give up the world they knew and start new lives. They arrived in Oklahoma as the oil-based economy took shape and negotiated terms that enabled them to sell parcels of land while keeping ownership of the minerals beneath them.\n\nThe Osage people did not expect to find any oil, let alone end up with the highest per capita wealth in the country. They lived the \"American dream\" of electric-powered prosperity better than white Americans ever dreamt possible. But white settlers followed the money, devising ruthless schemes to take Osage land and oil for themselves.\n\nThis is the world that Killers of the Flower Moon presents its viewers. It is a three-and-a-half-hour barrage of senseless killing masterminded by William Hale ( Robert De Niro ), a white patriarch who embedded himself within the Osage community. Hale called himself \"King of the Osage Hills\" and a \"true friend\" of the Osage people as he planned their deaths. Hale persuaded his nephew Ernest Burkhart ( Leonardo DiCaprio ) to woo and marry Mollie Kyle (Gladstone), who came from a wealthy Osage family.\n\nMore than 60 Osage people, including many members of Mollie's family, lost their lives to mysterious poisonings or shootings before J. Edgar Hoover's newly created Bureau of Investigations intervened and brought Hale and others to justice. The devastation of the Osage people was a means to an end, a trade-off the settlers were willing to make.\n\nLong before the movie came to screens, it took a white author, David Grann , to give this story the national profile it deserves in his 2017 book Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI . However, Grann wasn't the first author to tell the Osage people's story; Chickasaw author Linda Hogan recounted it in her Pulitzer prize-winning book Mean Spirit in 1990, and 15 years later, Osage author Charles H. Red Corn gave his own people a voice in his book A Pipe for February .\n\nNeither of those books caught the attention of Hollywood in the way Grann's book did. I can only hope the power and success of this film will give Native creators an opportunity to tell their stories to inform, educate, and entertain the wider world.\n\nBut more than anything, Killers of the Flower Moon gives audiences a false sense of comfort. It is easy to condemn atrocities that took place a century ago and assure ourselves that we are better people today. However, this story and the moral questions it raises are as pressing for us today as they were then.\n\nAs America and the wider world find new engines to power our lives, replacing oil with lithium, cobalt, and other raw elements, again, it is marginalized people who pay the price for progress. In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) \"modern-day slaves\" scrape the depths of mines to extract the cobalt used in more than 90 percent of the lithium batteries that power our cars. The DRC should be one of the wealthiest countries in the world, a Norway of Africa, but it remains one of the poorest.\n\nSimilar devastation is found where the quest for nickel, another vital element for electric car batteries, has destroyed villages and landscapes in Indonesia, Brazil, and other countries .  The waste byproducts poison the water, kill food sources, and increase the risks of respiratory disorders and cancers for those living nearby.\n\nNative Americans are also facing the threats of today's industrial progress. Earlier this year, the U.S. federal government approved what will be the country's largest lithium mine. Several Native nations objected to development in Thacker Pass , a nine-square-mile region of northern Nevada that they consider sacred land. It was on that same land that U.S. federal agents killed between 30 and 50 Native men, women, and children in 1865. Members of these tribes sued the federal government to stop this development, arguing that they were not sufficiently consulted. They lost their case in July, and development continues.\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon raises painful questions that need urgent answers as we pursue our quest for energy, prosperity, and a sustainable future. No form of energy is truly \"clean,\" which means that someone will pay an economic, environmental, and social cost for its production. It's far easier to make trade-offs in the name of progress when those trade-offs are made against people we don't know in places we don't see. As these cases show, this means that marginalized people will pay the highest price as others prosper.\n\nWe can't right the wrongs of the past-or the present-without putting those directly affected at the heart of decisions made. They must shape the options available, and they must share in the benefits realized, as the Osage people did when they were forced to Oklahoma. However, they must also be protected with transparency and legal accountability to ensure they retain their rightful benefits and that any development is undertaken with their permission on terms acceptable to them. They, and their world, must be respected as highly as the world of the companies that extract resources or the consumers who drive the cars that their land made possible.\n\nAchieving this will not be easy, but it is essential.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Colonial America's Little Secret: It's Always Been Miscegenation Nation\n\nWhen white nationalists clashed with their opponents in the streets of Charlottesville last August, the violence marked the latest battle in an old war. For many anxious and angry whites, our roots as an English-speaking Protestant nation under British laws are under attack. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions alluded to this in February , when he praised the country's \"Anglo-American heritage.\"\n\nBut recent historical and archaeological finds don't square with the traditional view of doughty colonists \"taming a continent,\" as President Donald Trump put it in his May speech to Naval Academy graduates. Foreigners, it turns out, were essential to English success in the New World, as were the indigenous groups they encountered. And long before Ellis Island, at the very start of the American experiment, whites flouted English law by mixing their genes as well as their culture with peoples from three continents.\n\nWhen Sir Walter Raleigh launched England's first attempt to settle the Americas in 1585, his country was a poor and backward place on Europe's fringe. The knight had to hire a Portuguese pirate to transport the colonists to Roanoke Island on the coast of North Carolina, and a German Jew to identify precious metals once they arrived-a radical move for a country that had banned Jews for three centuries. Two decades later, at Jamestown Island in Virginia, one London backer noted \"we have already provided and sent thither skillful workmen from foreign parts.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOnce the English arrived on Roanoke and Jamestown and, still later, at Plymouth in Massachusetts, they depended heavily on the local Algonquian-speaking peoples for food supplies traded to the ill-prepared immigrants. Excavations also show that the two peoples did not live as rigorously separate as once thought. At Jamestown, for example, vast numbers of Indian artifacts found recently in the early fort, from mussel shell beads and stone tools to earthen pots, show that indigenous people were living and working among the English.\n\nThey inevitably shared genes, as well as goods and technology, despite harsh punishments designed to prevent this. Spanish spies at Jamestown reported that forty or fifty English abandoned their countrymen to live with Indian wives. In 1612, the Virginia governor had the deserters captured and then \"hanged, sunburned, some broken up on wheels, others to be staked and some shot to death\" to discourage others from following suit.\n\nPocahontas' marriage to John Rolfe two years later proved the exception to the rule. In 1691, Virginia forbade settlers from marrying the indigenous people, as well as the Africans brought in to work the expanding tobacco plantations, \"for prevention of that abominable mixture and spurious issue.\" Similar laws remained on Virginia's books until 1967.\n\nYet Colonial America's dirty little secret, exposed by historians in the past decade or two, was that most of the settlers who were captured by or who willingly fled to Native American societies usually refused to return. In 1747, New York's surveyor general reported with dismay to the king's council that \"no arguments, entreaties, no tears of their friends and relations, could persuade many of them to leave their new Indian friends.\" The few who did \"run away again to the Indians and ended their days with them.\"\n\nBenjamin Franklin remarked with only some exaggeration that \"no European who has tasted savage life can afterwards bear to live in our societies.\" This wasn't a case of Stockholm syndrome, in which hostages develop a close bond with their captors-it didn't work both ways. \"We have no examples of even one of these Aborigines having from choice become Europeans,\" wrote one New Yorker in 1782.\n\nFor English settlers, who firmly believed that they brought the tools of civilization and the light of Christianity to their barbaric neighbors, these desertions were deeply troubling. Nowhere is that more evident than with Raleigh's second attempt to establish an English settlement on Roanoke Island. In 1587, 115 English men, women, and children landed on Roanoke. War with Spain severed their contact with England, and when a rescue mission arrived three years later, the settlers had vanished.\n\nElizabethans quite sensibly assumed that the abandoned colonists mixed with the locals. \"They have married with the Indians, and make 'em bring forth as beautiful faces as any we have in England,\" wrote Ben Jonson in a 1605 smash-hit comedy on the London stage. But later Americans largely ignored what was seen as an embarrassing failure until the 1830s, when a Harvard historian re-envisioned the effort as a romantic mystery.\n\nEverything from aliens to zombies have since been evoked to explain the disappearance of the Lost Colonists.\n\nYet most historians, anthropologists, and archaeologists today agree with the Elizabethans-that at least some of the settlers became Indians rather than starve. When the second wave of English arrived in the 17th century, those Native Americans who had survived European diseases retreated into remote Carolina swamps, where they were, in time, joined by renegade whites and escaped African slaves. These mixed communities were deemed colored. The colonists' likeliest descendants, therefore, would today be considered African American.\n\n\"America was founded by white people,\" says David Duke. \"It was founded for white people. America was not founded to be a multiracial, multicultural society.\" It's an old belief, but one that is factually incorrect.\n\nThere is no denying the American debt to British representative democracy and common law, not to mention our language. And it is true that the bulk of our citizens trace most of their ancestry back to Europe. But thanks to excavations in trenches and among archives, we know that the United States was, from its very beginning, a multiracial and multicultural society, and it never ceased being so.\n\nOf course, myths can't be conquered by facts, and beliefs are not subject to scientific proof. But if we want to prevent the sort of violence that wracked a quiet Virginia college town one year ago, we will have to move beyond the corrosive concept of a nation founded by only one sort of people. We will have to embrace an America that is, as Vice President Hubert Humphrey said, is \"all the richer for the many different and distinctive strands of which it is woven.\"\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Our Obligation to Native Americans Has Not Gone Away\n\nOn the eve of this Thanksgiving holiday, most Americans have heard the heartwarming story of the Native Americans who welcomed the Pilgrims, taught them how to plant crops, and joined them after the harvest in a first Thanksgiving celebration.\n\nBut how many Americans understand the story of next four centuries of Native American life in the United States? It is the story of shameful treatment by our government. The Indian Removal Act. The Trail of Tears. Wounded Knee. Gripping, relentless poverty. Trust accounts plundered by the government. And so much more.\n\n\"Wasn't that between your ancestors and my ancestors?\", a member of the audience once asked Joseph Marshall III, a Native American historian, at a Colorado College campus lecture. \"Why should I be held responsible for the plight of Native Americans?\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Because you know the story,\" Marshall replied.\n\nIt's a profound concept. When we know the story of injustice, we are obligated to fix it.\n\nI've told those stories of injustice in a book that will be released today, titled The Girl in the Photograph . The photograph in question-of an adorable but sad little girl with a tear on her cheek-caught my attention when it originally appeared in the Bismarck Tribune , my state's flagship newspaper, in 1990 under the headline \"Foster Home Children Beaten-And Nobody's Helping.\"\n\nThe story is about one young girl on an Indian reservation, but it is about so much more.\n\nHer name is Tamara. And to say that life has been difficult for her it is a bit of an understatement. None of us will really ever know what it was like.\n\nTamara was born in 1985. As a 2-year-old, this Native American child, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe that lives in both North and South Dakota, was severely beaten in a foster care home at what was called a drunken party. Her arm, nose, and leg were broken, and her hair pulled out at the roots. That horrible beating has affected her for the next three decades of her life.\n\nShe belonged to a dysfunctional family. She describes being sexually abused by an extended family member and mistreated by alcoholic parents. She ran away from this horror when she could.\n\nLost and lonely, she suffered in silent pain from the PTSD that affected her every day, wondering why and how it all had happened to her. She joined the nearly invisible homeless population on the streets of Minneapolis, living on one meal a day and sleeping under a bridge or couch surfing when she could.\n\nShe had almost no memory of her youth. She felt life was hopeless. She attempted to end her life three times.\n\nFinally, she found help at a Salvation Army homeless shelter in Minneapolis. She ended up spending nearly a year and a half in that shelter. And that experience was the beginning of finding some stability in her life.\n\nIn the several years since she left the homeless shelter, Tamara's life has improved. She now has a place to live, some assistance income, and some prescription medicine for her nightmares and crowd anxiety. She has a boyfriend who treats her with respect.\n\nShe is smart and talented. She loves music. She is studying Japanese and found it interesting that she seems to have an easy time learning a foreign language. Yet she's still affected by health issues that never leave. She yearns to have a respite from the difficult challenges that life has offered. Still, she hesitates to think of a day when she could move beyond the health problems and poverty so persistent in her life and finally begin a future with more opportunity for her.\n\nShe doesn't know what her future holds.\n\nTamara is 34 years old now. A young woman whose life story contains so much sadness and tragedy. What comes next for Tamara, and also for so many other Native American children who are trapped in circumstances like the ones that Tamara has faced?\n\nThe silence that surrounds the plight of Tamara and so many other children living on Indian reservations is deafening. It is, for too many children, a life of gripping poverty and all of the problems that attend that poverty including hunger, violence, homelessness, and much more.\n\nThe rampant unemployment, income inequality, racism, and crime have especially victimized women and children. But it also applies to the entire population of those who were here first.\n\nThis is not some mysterious disease for which we don't know the cure. This is a crisis, and it is a disgrace that so many children of the first Americans in our country are living in third world conditions.\n\nThis is Tamara's story. But it could be thousands of other children who desperately need our help.\n\nIt has become too easy for non-Native Americans to avoid accountability for what has happened to Native Americans.\n\nIt's time to awaken our country and end the suffering of the children and others whose lives I describe in my book. I hope it will force all of us to understand, if we do our part, together we can turn the cycle of failure into a future of success for the first Americans and their children.\n\nThere is no better time to recognize our responsibilities to the first Americans than at Thanksgiving. Why? Because we know the story!\n\nBYRON L. DORGAN served as a congressman and senator for North Dakota for 30 years before retiring in January 2011.

      "text": "The Native American Activists Exposing Celebrity 'Race-Fakers'\n\nRace and Identity Reporter\n\nFor years, Heather Rae Bybee was considered to be one of Hollywood's most prominent Native American directors. She described her mother as Cherokee, sported a tattoo of a Cherokee goddess, told the stories of Native characters in her award-winning films, and was a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Science's Indigenous Alliance.\n\nBut the film industry was left in shock earlier this year when Rae was accused of being just 1/2048th Cherokee at most, prompting her to publicly acknowledge that she is not, in fact, Indigenous.\n\n\"I'm still in that process [of looking into my family history],\" she admitted to The Hollywood Reporter , \"so for several years I have identified as an ally.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBehind that bombshell accusation was a little-known group of loose acquaintances who have teamed up to create a whistleblower organization dedicated to outing what they call redface posers who \"are actively contributing to [Indigenous] erasure/genocide.\"\n\nThe Tribal Alliance Against Frauds (TAAF) has only been around a year, but it's made waves addressing alleged race-fakers who the organization say co-opt Native American cultures and stereotypes for monetary and professional gain.\n\n\"This is the last nail in the coffin of our genocide because these pretendians are-literally-erasing us by replacing us,\" TAAF's director, Lianna Costantino, said in an interview with The Daily Beast.\n\nCostantino, a citizen of the Cherokee Nation, said she and a few others formed an unofficial hub for Native Americans when they noticed they had hundreds or thousands of mutual friends on social media. For years, they provided tribal resources for Native Americans, educational tools for Native history and genealogy, and promoted Native Americans making headway within their professional endeavors. However, in May 2022, the group took it a step further and founded TAAF to address posers within their communities.\n\n\"We were immediately inundated with people telling us their stories, sending us impact statements, asking for help in real-life situations where they were actively being harmed by pretendians and suffering consequences of the bad behaviors of these pretendians,\" Costantino, a chaplain and educator, said, referring in particular to race-fakers who claim to be spiritual doctors and medicine people who can ended up committing serious harm.\n\nHeather Rae Bybee.\n\nAccording to TAAF's website , the group-made up of American Indian and ally researchers, law enforcement officers, scholars, and over 50 members from across the nation-exposes \"ethnic frauds pretending to be American Indian people or 'tribes' when they are not.\"\n\nTAAF says it isn't concerned with people who believe they have American Indian ancestry based on \"unfounded family lore\" but, rather, \"individuals, groups, and [corporations] who falsely represent American Indian cultures, histories, and spiritual practices and/or falsely claim American Indian identity as individuals for profit or fame.\"\n\nThe group maintains a healthy list of alleged \"pretendians\" along with genealogical reports compiled by their members, as well as organizations that allegedly support Native race-fakers.\n\n\"Representation matters because it shapes how the wider public views the world,\" says the TAAF website. \"American Indians have long been under-represented in American culture, and much of what Americans know about American Indians is based on monolithic stereotypes and lies. Allowing non-American Indians to market themselves as having an American Indian identity continues that harm by perpetuating stereotypes and silencing actual American Indian voices.\"\n\nThe work of proving someone is a race-faker is intensive. TAAF's investigations include compiling full \"fan charts\" of the alleged perpetrator's genealogy, which pinpoint the person's ancestry back to the country origin or far enough back to discredit their claim of a specific tribe. They also seek letters from tribal offices noting that the person, or a family member the person claims has American Indian ancestry, is not listed in their database.\n\nFor the sake of other members' safety, Costantino acts as the sole face of TAAF.\n\n\"There's really nothing anybody can do to hurt me,\" said Costantino, who said she felt a moral responsibility to expose race-fakers, especially since Native populations have waned. \"The trolls just want to doxx all of us and harass all of us and bully us and give us a hard time. They're irrelevant. They're mosquitoes buzzing in our ears. We don't care. We swat them and move on.\"\n\nTAAF founder Lianna Costantino.\n\nA professional genealogist who works with TAAF, and who wished to remain anonymous due to security concerns and fears of being doxxed, told The Daily Beast that the process of looking into a \"pretendian\" requires an \"all-hands-on-board group effort.\"\n\nThe genealogist, who has knowledge in First Nations history and is a member of several historical societies, said that when the group starts an ancestral tree, they structure the research to determine if the person has Native American ancestry \"beyond reasonable doubt.\"\n\n\"If we find a conflict or contradictory information we discuss as a group, define the conflict, analyze the conflict and resolve the issue,\" the genealogist explained. \"We will then consult directly the respective Sovereign Nations the person has claimed, providing them with [the] name or names of the person/people to check for... Being Sovereign Nations, they have the final word of who is or who is not an associate, Citizen or descendant of their People. They have the final word. Their word is the ultimate proof.\"\n\nThe genealogist began their own ancestral digging about 13 years ago before starting on a volunteer basis with TAAF. \"I found I had an aptitude for sleuthing, identifying and resolving genealogical questions, and general tree development,\" they said. \"Genealogy is my passion.\"\n\nThey said a TAAF report on one person often takes anywhere from 30 to 50 hours, sometimes longer.\n\nDrew Hayden Taylor, a First Nation Canadian writer who has worked with Costantino on The Pretendians documentary, called the group's work \"admirable.\"\n\n\"An organization that has the research capabilities to look into those who are accused of being pretendians is necessary in these times,\" Taylor told The Daily Beast.\n\nThe group has already made some eye-opening discoveries. In their most recent investigation, they alleged that James Russell \"Owl Goingback\" Heidbrink , a celebrated author, is an \"ethnic fraud...of European ancestry\" for allegedly claiming to be \"'half Cherokee and half Choctaw.'\"\n\nAccording to Goingback's website , he has been a professional writer of novels and children's books for over 30 years, with many of his books framed around Native American culture. He's won multiple literary awards, including being a Lifetime Achievement winner at the Bram Stoker Awards, been featured as a \"Powerful Voice in Fantasy and Horror\" at the World Fantasy Convention , and had his works lauded on notorious literary podcast Book Riot . In June, he was featured as a guest of honor at StokerCon in Pittsburgh.\n\nAfter noticing Goingback's rising popularity, Costantino said TAAF contacted him to offer support and a chance to prove his identity. But when he ignored multiple requests, TAAF members decided to do some digging.\n\n(Goingback told The Daily Beast that he did not respond to TAAF's questions because the organization has \"no actual authority to make such demands, and it is foolish to argue with internet trolls.\")\n\nAccording to TAAF, Goingback legally changed his name from James Russell Heidbrink. The Daily Beast confirmed through online Seminole County court documents that it took place in 2000. TAAF also compiled a family tree that the group says showed the majority of his father's family traces back to Europe, and his mother's side were always labeled as \"white\" on U.S. census reports.\n\nTAAF also included letters from both the Cherokee and Choctaw tribes that said neither Heidbrink nor his ancestors were descendants of enrolled members. Goingback maintained to The Daily Beast that his family is not currently enrolled because they do not \"want to be considered wards of the federal government,\" despite Indigenous nations being sovereign from the government.\n\nErika T. Wurth , a celebrated writer who describes herself as an \"urban Native of Apache/Chickasaw/Cherokee descent\" also \"continues to fake a Native identity for personal gain,\" TAAF has claimed.\n\nCostantino told The Daily Beast that initial conversations with Wurth on social media were pleasant, but the chatter took a negative tone as soon as she wanted to cut to the chase and verify Wurth's ancestry.\n\n\"In reality, Wurth's family were white settlers from the Eastern United States, who settled into Texas in the 19th century. NONE were American Indians,\" TAAF's report alleged.\n\nIn a request for comment, Wurth's literary agent did not address TAAF's claims but said the group engaged in \"tools of manipulation and unwarranted persecution of Native Americans.\"\n\nIn its investigation on Rae , the film director, TAAF found that her ancestors married and lived on Indian Territory, but were not tribal members.\n\nEven though Rae later acknowledged that she is not Indigenous and has been trying to \"reframe\" who she is, TAAF says she has yet to acknowledge the privileges that claiming Native American ancestry provided her.\n\n\"Simply erasing 'Cherokee'...is not enough, because her 'brand' is that of a Cherokee woman,\" TAAF's report claimed, \"built on years of work on American Indian related films.\"\n\nBesides writers, TAAF has conducted investigations on self-proclaimed tribal elders and educators , among others, and the group has plans to release more reports in the near future.\n\nThe goal, Costantino said, \"is to end pretendian fraud and all of its forms.\"\n\n\"The fact that we can't turn in any direction without running into them making a mockery of us, taking up spaces meant for us, silencing us, replacing us, distorting our histories, languages, ceremonies, we are sick of it,\" she said, taking the mission personally as an act of injustice. \"At first they wanted to exterminate us. Now, they all want to be us. It's a very odd turn of events.\"\n\nRace and Identity Reporter\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "Were Humans Really in America 100,000 Years Before We Thought?\n\nSince the early sixteenth century, Europeans have referred to America as the \"New World.\" It was in their minds a place of discovery and opportunity, a new and young land ripe for inhabitation. But a new archaeological study is calling that into question.\n\nAn article in the prestigious magazine Nature claims to have uncovered evidence that proves that there were humans in North America as long as 130,000 years ago. Given that conventional scientific wisdom maintains that Homo sapiens colonized the Americas roughly 15,000 years ago, around the end of the Pleistocene era, this evidence promises to radically reshape the history of the Americas.\n\nA team led by Steven Holen of the Archeological Institute of America analyzed material excavated in 1992-93 from the Cerutti Mastodon archaeological site in Southern California. In one layer of stream-deposited sediment, they found the remains of a mastodon, a now-extinct animal related to elephants. The bones of the mastodon, which were found in clusters associated with cobbles, possessed marks suggestive of battering by hammerstones. The ends of the bones were broken, which might indicate that the bones were deliberately broken in order to create access to the bone marrow contained therein. Other animals bones found in neighboring layers did not possess the same features.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHolen and his team suggest that the stones were used to break the bones. This raises the question: by whom?\n\nWell, humans, of one kind or another. According to the coverage in Nature , \"Rigorous uranium-series dating of the bones yielded an estimated burial age of 130,700 +/- 9,700 years ago, coinciding with the beginning of the wet and warm last interglacial period. The finds... could place hominins in the New World more than 100,000 years earlier than previously thought.\"\n\nIt would be a paradigm-shifting discovery. It raises all kinds of questions-like, where did these hominins come from and what happened to them after they came here?\n\nThe problem is that the argument for human involvement is entirely indirect. The bones are real; the dating is accurate; but there are no humans at the site. This is why a number of prominent scientists have been calling the study's findings into question.\n\nWhat this discovery reveals is a very different kind of history: the racially charged history of \"ancient man\" claims in the New World.\n\nIn fact, as Jon Marks, an anthropologist at the University of North Carolina-Charlotte and author of the recently published Is Science Racist? , told me, \"American archaeology has always been tied up with the politics of Native Americans-their history and identity.\"\n\nThe first question that archaeologists asked in the 1830s was, who built the ancient monuments at Cahokia in the Mississippi Valley? Today Cahokia contains about 80 mounds, but in its prime the site was much larger. You might think that the question didn't need answering: surely it was the Native Americans? At the time, this seemed impossible.\n\nAs Marks put it, \"Assuming it could not have been the ancestors of the rude, impoverished, savages we were busily displacing and murdering, then who else could it have been?  And of course, it was indeed their ancestors-which is the answer that crystallized American archaeology as a scholarly discipline.\" The discipline of American archaeology was generated by a racist assumption that had political consequences. Scholarly efforts to dislocate indigenous people from the history of the land and, especially, their cultural contributions, serve to make indigenous people less indigenous. Whether deliberately or not, that refiguring of indigenous peoples is easily used to justify colonialization.\n\nInterestingly, this impulse was paralleled almost exactly in later archaeological studies of the Great Zimbabwe, an 11 th -15 th century CE city, located near Lake Mutirikwe in Zimbabwe. When the amateur archaeologist J. Theodore Bent began to study the monument in the late nineteenth century, under the patronage of Cecil Rhodes, he argued that city was constructed either by the Phoenicians or by a Semitic people. By his third book he was arguing more precisely for \"a Semitic race... of Arabian origin.\"\n\nOver the course of the twentieth century, a variety of different groups were credited with the city's construction. It was only in the 1950s that archaeologists began to recognize the now-consensus view that the Great Zimbabwe was built by Africans, but they were pressured by the Rhodesian government to alter their conclusions.\n\nIn the United States, the lightning rod in this conversation has been the racial identity of those people who are supposed to have pre-dated Native Americans.  In Across Atlantic Ice: The Origin of America's Clovis Culture , Smithsonian archaeologists Dennis J. Stanford and Bruce A. Bradley argued that almost 15,000 years before native Americans arrived in the Americas from Siberia (approximately 13,000-14,000 years ago), the North West was populated by early Europeans.\n\nTheir  argument is based on the similarities between American Clovis stone points and French Solutrean points. The similarities between the two were first noted in the 1970s, but scholars could not account for the chronological distance between the evidence, the lack of evidence for maritime activity during this period, and the absence of non-technological cultural transfer from France to the Americas.\n\nThe lack of evidence did not prevent Kyle Bristow, a lawyer and former Michigan State University student known for inviting white supremacists to speak at his college chapter of Young Americans for Freedom, to use the Solutrean hypothesis to author the novel White Apocalypse . The conceit of the book is that Solutrean culture was mercilessly wiped out by invading Beringians (the ancestors of modern Native Americans). The genocide of the ancient Europeans, we learn through the rogue anthropologist protagonist, has been concealed from us in a giant conspiracy. Bristow is now a lawyer who represents, among others, Matthew Heimbach, the head of the white nationalist traditionalist Youth Network, being sued for allegedly shoving a woman of color and calling her a \"c**t\" and a \"n****r\" at a Trump rally in 2016.\n\nBut I digress.\n\nScientists today almost exclusively reject the Solutrean hypothesis, but twenty years ago a variant on this hypothesis was used to argue that Kennewick Man was not Native American. The prehistoric remains of Kennewick Man, as he was known, were discovered along the banks of the Columbia River region in Kennewick, Washington in 1996.  To the dismay of the anthropological community, he was initially racialized as a European and, against the objections of the local Umatilla people, his remains were removed for further study.\n\nThe archaeologists who initially worked on the bones, James Chatters and Douglas Owsley, argued quite forcefully that the remains were not Native American and thus unrelated to the Umatilla people. Chatters argued that the skull was \"Caucasoid\" and literally resembled Patrick Stewart. Owsley argued for Polynesian origins.\n\nKennewick Man was the focal point of a nine-year court case in which Native American tribes fought to gain ownership of the Kennewick Man (whom they referred to as 'the Ancient One').  In 2004 the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that because a cultural link could not be established between the remains and any of the Native American tribes, the scientific community could continue to study them.\n\nIt was only in 2015, when geneticists at the University of Copenhagen demonstrated that, among living peoples, the Kennewick Man is most closely related to the Native American tribes, including the Umatilla, that the question was settled. He has since been repatriated under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, but for nearly a decade scholarly claims about his racial identity were used to strip Native Americans of their cultural heritage.\n\nIt is not the case that the scientists performing the latest study, or any study on human origins, are racist themselves. Rather, it's that this whole question is racially and politically loaded. Anytime a person makes the claim that there were people on a particular continent that predate the indigenous peoples encountered by later Westerners, they are making the kind of claim that, historically speaking, has been used to justify the subjugation of those people.\n\nIf there were people here before the Native Americans, that's historically and anthropologically important information, but it has to be strongly supported. As Marks said, \"This isn't fruit-fly science...[It's] a strong bio-political statement, and needs to have a firmer basis.\"\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this article erroneously credited Billy Roper, 2012 Presidential candidate for the Nationalist Party of America as the author of \"White Resistance,\" Roper's comments endorsing the book to \"White Nationalists\" was actually an endorsement from the book's inside cover.\n\ncandidarmoss@gmail.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Native Americans Have Had Enough of This Pilgrim History Museum\n\nRace and Identity Reporter\n\nNative Americans in Massachusetts are calling for a boycott of a museum that they say has been erasing tribes' place in history, while investing in the portrayal of Pilgrims who settled in Plymouth Colony.\n\nMembers of the Wampanoag tribe say they were once more deeply involved in the Plimoth Patuxet Museums, but now their participation has dwindled.\n\n\"I would say most of the people in my tribe worked there at one point or another, but they treated us so bad that nobody wanted to work there anymore,\" Anita Peters, a member of the Mashpee Wampanoag tribe and former museum employee, told The Daily Beast.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe Plimoth Patuxet Museums -based in Plymouth, Massachusetts-is dedicated to telling the thousands-year history of Native Americans in the area and the arrival of Pilgrims via the Mayflower in 1620. The museum is designed to be a living history experience, where guests can see traditional Wampanoag wetu (houses), artifact replicas, and artwork from the 1600s. The site initially opened in the 1940s, using the 17th century colonialist spelling of \" Plimoth .\"\n\nWhile it might seem like the museum offers an all-encompassing view of history, Wampanoag members say the museum prioritizes the colonialist past over their own. They've complained about the Indigenous section of the museum being small, outdated, and not maintained to the same extent as the Pilgrim side, and that museum administrators don't value their cultural contributions enough to include them in current decision making.\n\nThroughout the 74 years I lived in Mass, I spent many happy hours in Plimoth Plantation's Native Village, my second home. Best wishes my friends. Serious changes should have been made long ago. Hopefully a new world is waiting just beyond the horizon.\n\nCheryl Andrews-Maltais, chairwoman of the Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head Aquinnah, said in an interview with The Daily Beast that the museum has not adequately consulted with Native Americans about their history.\n\n\"We still have to spend a lot of time correcting the narrative that they were putting out there because it was still feeding into the false narrative. That has been the history that we've had to endure throughout the centuries,\" she said. \"The focus really wasn't on having that bicultural, balanced experience. ...We knew just how critically important it was to set the record straight and provide that balance.\"\n\nAndrews-Maltais, who said she, her mother, sister, and brothers all worked at the museum at some point, noted that the Native American side of the museum has not seen any noticeable improvements over the last 50 years, despite the museum receiving federal funding. Meanwhile, she said the Pilgrim division stays updated with new exhibits and features.\n\n\"That relays or communicates a really big misinformation that we did not have the sophistication of our culture and our practice the way that [Pilgrims] would have been at that time, almost reflecting that we're kind of dirt poor and ignorant,\" she said. \"Well, we weren't.\"\n\nAccording to the Associated Press , large holes have been found in replicas of traditional Wampanoag housing, which are a main attraction on the historical site. Guides on the Native American side also did not wear traditional attire. But Pilgrim housing has been well maintained and guides wear detailed 17th-century costumes.\n\nIn a statement to The Daily Beast Wednesday, spokesperson Robert Kluin said Plimoth Patuxet has raised $2 millions for overall renovations, for the Pilgrim site, Wampanoag site, and online campaigns. But he did not provide a breakdown of how the funds would be appropriated or how federal funding had already been used to maintain the museum and homesite.\n\nPaula Peters, a member of the Wampanoag Mashpee tribe who worked off and on for about 40 years as an interpreter and in the marketing department at the museum, said she was astonished during a recent trip. She provided photos to The Daily Beast of wetu housing covered in holes, and said Native Americans who work at the museum have been hired from other tribes.\n\n\"There's less and less Wampanoag employees. ...They also have changed a lot,\" she said.\n\nThe Wampanoag are the people native to the overall region, which is called Patuxet . However, tribal members are leery that the specific Wampanoag culture is being assimilated into a larger identity.\n\n\"It used to be called the Wampanoag Homesite, and it's no longer called that. It's called the Patuxet Homesite ,\" Peters said, adding, \" It's almost like they're erasing from the nomenclature.\"\n\nWampanoag Mashpee tribe member Sookunôn Nushkeesuqut told The Daily Beast that he was warned by museum officials that he would be fired for taking too much time off work to be a ceremonial performer during funerals and spiritual services. He also said that museum employees faced racism and microaggressions from guests.\n\nAnita Peters agreed. She said museum officials did not stand up for Wampanoag employees whenever they encountered offensive behavior from tourists. Instead, they were told to just smile it off.\n\n\"Tourists would say ignorant things and we were told, 'Well, as long as you have a smile on your face, you can say what you want,'\" she said, recalling how a woman visiting the park once stuck her head underneath a Wampanoag guide's loincloth in order for her friends to take a picture. \"I thought, 'No, no. That'll make them think we're just clowns, you know, tolerate any kind of racism or anything like that.'\"\n\nIn response to allegations of workers experiencing racism, Kluin said the museum \"has a zero tolerance policy with regard to discrimination of any kind takes immediate steps to investigate and respond to any incidents that are reported to us.\"\n\nHe added that the museum provides training for its employees on how to handle tough situations with guests, empowering its \"staff to remove themselves from any uncomfortable situation.\"\n\nKluin said the Wampanoag history is vital to the future of Plimoth Patuxet Museums. He did not directly address the holes found in Wampanoag housing, but claimed a spring storm had destroyed some signage around the site. He also said that exhibits for both the Wampanoag and Pilgrim divisions are being expanded and that more staff members would be added.\n\n\"Our team firmly believes that hiring from within Indigenous communities is vital to fostering an authentic learning experience. We have several initiatives in place to recruit and retain professionals from within both hyper-local Wampanoag communities and broader Indigenous communities,\" Kluin said.\n\n\"As a cultural institution, we recognize a responsibility to reach out to our employees,\" he added, \"the communities we serve and the communities reflected in the stories we tell to assure that we are meeting our high standards for representation.\"\n\nRegardless of the museum's insistence that it remains committed to Wampanoag representation, some within the community just aren't buying it. Instead of hiring members or seeking advice from the Wampanoag, tribal members say the museum has been recruiting Native Americans from other communities and seemingly trying to pass them off as Wampanoag-treating different Native American tribes as a monolithic group.\n\n\"I'd be surprised if you could find anyone in the tribe that would recommend going there or working there,\" Paula Peters said.\n\nRace and Identity Reporter\n\nGot a tip?

The lawsuit differs from others that target drug companies, because it names eight members of the Sackler family, which founded and owns Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin. We speak with attorney Brendan Johnson, partner with the law firm Robins Kaplan and chair of its American Indian Law and Policy Group, about the federal lawsuit he filed on behalf of three Native American tribes from the Dakotas against major opioid manufacturers and distributors. We are also joined by Stacy Bohlen, CEO of the National Indian Health Board and a citizen of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I'm Amy Goodman, as we turn to look at how a group of more than 500 cities, counties and Native American tribes have filed a lawsuit against members of the Sackler family for their role in creating, quote, \"the worst drug crisis in American history,\" unquote, by lying about the dangers of the opioid painkiller OxyContin and deceitful marketing of the drug. The lawsuit was filed last week in the Southern District of New York and differs from other lawsuits that targeted drug companies, because it names eight members of the Sackler family, which founded and owns Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin. Opioid overdoses are responsible for nearly 50,000 deaths per year in the United States, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found Native Americans have suffered the largest increase in overdose deaths.\n\nFor more, we're joined in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, by attorney Brendan Johnson, partner in the law firm Robins Kaplan and chair of their American Indian Law and Policy Group. Earlier this year, he filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of three Native American tribes from the Dakotas against major opioid manufacturers and distributors. Johnson is the former U.S. attorney for South Dakota. And in Washington, D.C., Stacy Bohlen is with us, the chief executive officer of the National Indian Health Board. She's a citizen of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians.\n\nBrendan Johnson and Stacy Bohlen, we welcome you both to Democracy Now! Brendan, lay out your lawsuit.\n\nBRENDAN JOHNSON : Right. Well, first of all, it's an honor to be here, and thank you for putting attention on this important issue.\n\nSo, our lawsuit, in terms of the legal claims and the facts, are not dissimilar from several of the other lawsuits that you've discussed this morning, in that we are targeting the prescription drug companies that we feel like inappropriately marketed this product. Where ours are different, where our lawsuits are different, of course, is we are just representing Indian tribes. Indian tribes, as you heard earlier this morning, have been disproportionately affected. And this is something that I saw while I was U.S. attorney in South Dakota. As we would go from tribal community to tribal community, what we would consistently hear is about how these opioid-the opioids had really affected the community, about the high rates of addiction, both amongst the elderly as well as the young. Really, there wasn't a consistent demographic.\n\nAnd, unfortunately, what we've seen is, this problem continued to escalate, as we outline in our complaint, in that now we're seeing more and more Native American children that are being born addicted to opioids. And it's creating-really wreaking a lot of havoc in tribal communities, even to the point now where we're seeing more Native American children who wind up being put up for adoption as a result of having parents that are addicted to opioids. So, this threat to tribal communities across the United States, not just in South Dakota, is really an existential one.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, can you talk specifically about the Native American nations, the tribes that you're representing?\n\nBRENDAN JOHNSON : Right. So, what we've seen with the tribes is that the impact has been significant. The tribes, of course, range from, for example, Pine Ridge, which is one of our clients, that has over 40,000 members, to some of our tribes that have 200 to 300 members. Each of them has been impacted significantly. And so, first of all, oftentimes we're talking about some of the most strained economies in the country, where you'll see unemployment rates of 80 percent. You'll see already high rates of drug and alcohol addiction. But now, when you layer the opioid epidemic on it, it is having this profound impact on these communities, that, frankly, oftentimes, too, don't have any sort of resources when it comes to drug treatment centers. So you have people oftentimes in rural, isolated communities without access to drug treatment programs. And this, again, is affecting the elderly; it's affecting men, women, children. It really knows no bounds within these communities and poses a real threat for the future of our tribal communities in America.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you compare this lawsuit to taking on Big Tobacco?\n\nBRENDAN JOHNSON : Well, and our law firm was one of the leaders in Big Tobacco. And, you know, Amy, one of the biggest differences, and one thing that tribes should feel real proud about here, now, I think, is, when it came to Big Tobacco, when our law firm, we represented the state of Minnesota in that case, tribes didn't have a seat at the table. And that's how it's often been for tribes over the last 200 years. What is different here is that tribes do have a seat at the table, have been very aggressive in their claims, because oftentimes the state and the state attorney generals-too often, the tribal communities are forgotten. And here, that won't be the case. And so I think that's the biggest difference, is that tribes are involved, whereas with Big Tobacco they were not.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to turn now to Stacy Bohlen, chief executive officer of the National Indian Health Board, citizen of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between '99 in 2015 Native Americans had the largest increase in overdose deaths compared to other groups. Why, Stacy, have Native Americans been hit so hard by the opioid crisis?\n\nSTACY BOHLEN : First of all, thank you for having me on the show. It's a real honor for the National Indian Health Board to be here.\n\nI think there are a lot of complex reasons why this crisis has hit Indian country harder than other places, but those reasons translate to all of the other health disparities and health challenges that tribes face, as well. I think that you're looking at very vulnerable populations of people who have a relationship with the federal government through the treaties, the trust responsibility, and have very vulnerable healthcare systems, that are funded below 50 percent of need despite those funds being promised through treaties, law and the political status of our people through the U.S. Constitution. So, you are dealing with rural and remote America in many cases. However, I think one of the foundational issues that's really important to understand is that because of our status as sovereign nations and our relationship with the federal government, when funding is brought from Congress through state block grants to fight the opioid crisis, the states are under no obligation to share any of that funding with tribes, because the relationship is with the federal government.\n\nSo, I think you have a number of circumstances conspiring. One is structural. One is unmet promises to Native people, that have existed before the existence of this country. One is communities that live with the trauma, postcolonial trauma, that they have experienced in their own ways, their own unique ways. You know, and there are a number of ways to address the crisis, but I think those are some of the elements of why it's hit our people so hard.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you link this, Stacy Bohlen, to the number of medical students and-Native American medical students and doctors?\n\nSTACY BOHLEN : Absolutely. I think one of the greatest challenges that Indian country faces is we lack healthcare providers in a very profound way. We have vast openings for physicians, dentists, behavioral health professionals, substance abuse professionals. Every ethnicity in the United States, every sort of group of people in the U.S. who attend medical school, all of their numbers are increasing for the number of graduates of medical school. Ours are actually declining. And that's declining from a number that was already not representative of our people. We had 11 graduates of medical schools last year, and I believe the number was five the year before. It's very low, very challenging to get our people into medical schools and get them graduated. Actually, we have high acceptance rates, but the way to fund being a medical student and the kind of supports that an individual needs to be successful are absent in our communities.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about how tribes have taken matters into their own hands in dealing with the opioid epidemic? You've testified before Congress. What are you calling for?\n\nSTACY BOHLEN : Well, first of all, we worked very hard to educate members of Congress about the fact that the great work they were doing to attempt to fund this crisis in America was not reaching our people. And we did have some success in getting earmarked funding, $50 million in 2018 and 2019, to go directly to tribes to help with this crisis. So we were very grateful for that. That needs to continue and increase.\n\nWe also call for more healthcare providers in our communities who are well qualified to help in these kind of crisis situations. We need economic development investment. You have heard the statistics. Some of our communities have up to 80 percent unemployment. That creates a foundation of vulnerability that impacts every aspect of life. And while this economic current status is being talked about as how strong our economies are in this country, that's not reaching Indian country, either. So, I think the number one disease that our people suffer from is anonymity or invisibility. People don't think about Indians. They don't have knowledge of the treaties that exist in the social contract between the U.S. government and the many Indian nations.\n\nBut some of the tribes are able to use their own resources to create clinics, to partner with local and state governments, when possible. Washington state-tribes in Washington state, led by the Swinomish Tribe, are doing an excellent job of creating clinical opportunities for people to receive drug treatment, drug counseling and preventative measures. So, in Arizona, in-throughout the country, you're seeing tribes have an insurgence of returning to cultural ways of knowing and cultural ways of treating addiction and a revitalization of those cultures as part of the answer that is successful for our people. But we need more investment.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Stacy Bohlen, I want to thank you for being with us and helping to make what has been invisible visible.\n\nSTACY BOHLEN : Thank you.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : CEO of the National Indian Health Board, citizen of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians. And to Brendan Johnson, thank for joining us from South Dakota, chair of the American Indian Law and Policy Group of his law firm.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Many of the students had been forcibly removed from their families and tribes as part of a government policy of cultural eradication and assimilation. The new report was led by Dana Hedgpeth, an enrolled member of the Haliwa-Saponi Tribe of North Carolina, and expanded its reach beyond federal records to achieve a full public accounting of the death toll of what many scholars and survivors have described as \"prison camps,\" not schools. Hedgpeth shares how some tribes have now been able to recover the remains of children who had been buried at the boarding schools and return them for traditional burials in their ancestral homelands. \"The impact of these schools is still being felt in many ways,\" she says.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : We end today's show with a damning new investigation by The Washington Post , which has determined that more than 3,100 Indigenous students died at boarding schools in the United States between 1828 and 1970. That figure is three times the number of deaths reported earlier this year by the U.S. Interior Department. The _Post_'s yearlong investigation also found more than 800 students were buried in cemeteries at or near the schools, which were designed to crush Native American culture. Many of the children had been forcibly removed from their families and tribes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : For more, we're joined by the report's lead author, Dana Hedgpeth. She's a Native American journalist who's been at The Washington Post for 25 years, an enrolled member of the Haliwa-Saponi Tribe of North Carolina. She co-authored the new investigation headlined \"More than 3,100 students died at schools built to crush Native American cultures.\" She co-wrote the piece with Sari Horwitz, investigative reporter and author of Justice in Indian Country , and also another piece headlined \"They took the children: The hidden legacy of Indian boarding schools in the United States.\"\n\nIt's great to have you with us. Welcome to Democracy Now! , Dana. Why don't you lay out all that you found, and this in the year with the first Native American cabinet member? And they also had come out with a report, but your number was three times more, 3,100 dead children at these schools. Explain what these schools were.\n\nDANA HEDGPETH : Thank you so much for having me. I really appreciate it.\n\nAs you mention, we did work here at the Post with an incredible team of journalists. Sari Horwitz, my colleague, is an award-winning journalist here at the Post . We worked with a team of data reporters and visual forensics reporters to do our investigation.\n\nAnd as you said, we found that 3,100 Native American, Alaskan Native and Hawaiian Native children died at these boarding schools. These are not what folks think of typically when you think of a boarding school. These are schools that were specifically designed, created with the sole purpose by the U.S. government of eradicating Native American culture and languages, for the number one purpose to assimilate them into white society. The schools were started in the 1800s. They ran for a period of about 150 years. And we really dug deep into hundreds of thousands of records to look into what really happened at these schools, what were the conditions, and found that, sadly, many of these children did not make it home and died at these institutions.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : So, Dana, could you explain, you know, what brought you to do this investigation in the first place? And, you know, what did these children, 3,100 - more than 3,100 children - what was the cause of death? How did they in fact die?\n\nDANA HEDGPETH : Very good question, and thank you for asking. First off, for me, I'm Native American. I'm an enrolled member of the Haliwa-Saponi Tribe from North Carolina. And as you played in one of your intro pieces, Secretary Haaland has said this many a times. Her assistant secretary, Bryan Newland, has said this many times. There's not an Indigenous person in this country who doesn't know the story of Indian boarding schools or who's not been impacted by this. These are widely known stories in Indian Country. Unfortunately, they are not as known in mainstream press and in society. They've largely been ignored and hidden and just not talked about. So we really wanted to shine a light on this history.\n\nAs you mentioned, Secretary Haaland, kudos to her, because for the first time, she's the only interior secretary to shine the light on her own department, who ran these very schools. They were started under what was then called the War Department - we now know it as the Pentagon - and then they were put under Interior. So, she took huge steps to do a three-year-long investigation looking at these schools, and she found that many of these schools did have - mistreat students. They were terribly run.\n\nAnd we expanded upon that work. Again, the Interior Department looked exclusively at federal records. We expanded beyond that, built upon that and looked at hundreds of thousands of records involving census rolls, school enrollment records, death certificates, historical maps, talking to researchers who had done thesis papers and for years - worked for 20 years on researching specific schools. We talked to dozens of Indian boarding school survivors who are still alive, in their sixties, seventies and eighties, to hear their recollections of these schools.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, how was there such a discrepancy? I mean, clearly, she, the first Native American interior secretary, cared deeply about this issue. Why did they come up with 800, you come up with 3,100? And one of the things you looked at were the cemeteries on the grounds. I mean, how many schools in this country are connected to cemeteries?\n\nDANA HEDGPETH : It's a very good and sad question, exactly. I have two children of my own, and their schools, thankfully, don't have cemeteries on their grounds. No school should have a cemetery on its ground. It's a terrible concept to think of.\n\nThe Interior Department did spend three years on their investigation. They produced two reports that dug deeply - again, she was the first secretary to look into this. It is a very personal issue for Deb Haaland. Many of her relatives went to these boarding schools, so it's deeply personal for her. She's of the Pueblo of Laguna Tribe. She knows this story very well.\n\nWe took it a step further. They found 973 documented deaths at these Indian boarding schools. And we took a step further by expanding our base. We looked not just at federal records. We looked at school records. We looked deep into the work that many researchers had already done. The sins of these schools are not unknown in Indian Country. Many great Native American journalists have been writing about this subject for years. We just took upon that work and expanded it to really give it a complete public accounting that it hasn't had before and to really tell these stories.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : So, Dana, could you tell us one of the stories, the one, for instance, that you begin with, Almeda Heavy Hair?\n\nDANA HEDGPETH : Almeda's story is incredible. It's sad and deep. She's from the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation, about 30 miles from the Canadian border in Montana. And we got to know about this tribe through a previous story we had done looking at sexual abuse of about a thousand children at these schools. That story came out earlier this summer, so this was our second investigation. We kept in touch with President Jeff Stiffarm, Mike Black Wolf, their tribal historic preservation officer there. And we knew that they were going to be attending and exhuming three of their students who, sadly, attended Carlisle and died. In 1890, Almeda, John Bishop - John Bull, excuse me, and Bishop Shield were part of 22 students who were taken from their reservation to Carlisle.\n\nIt still gives me the shivers to think of how we were so - such an honor to be able to watch their journey as they were exhumed at Carlisle, in a very sterile place with these white marble tombstones. Think of a mini Arlington in a way. We watched as those tribal members and 19 of her relatives stood for two days and watched them to be exhumed. They sat on traditional buffalo robes. They used ceremonial pipes. They sang. They drummed. They spoke in their own tribal language. These are the very things that those children would have been punished for. They would have been beaten, with food withheld. And they, sadly, died. Those three children died within four years of being at Carlisle.\n\nThen, as part of the ceremony of bringing them home, they were put in new pine boxes. Their remains - think about this - from 130 years ago were very carefully exhumed, put in new pine boxes, wrapped in buffalo robes, with traditional items, moccasins, earrings for Almeda, and put in these pine boxes and taken in a caravan for a four-day, 2,000-mile journey back to Montana, where they were buried in their traditional way on a beautiful hillside on their homeland. As John Stiffarm, one of the ceremonial leaders, said, when the Army officials who now are in control of the Carlisle property asked him, \"Do you what the dirt?\" he said, \"No, leave that dirt here. They're going to their homeland.\" You can tell that makes my voice quiver still, because it's so powerful in meaning. Everyone, across any culture, it's devastating to have your children taken. Then, to watch them be exhumed 130 years later and brought to their homeland, there's nothing more powerful than that. We wanted to tell that story. And Almeda was our way to tell that story.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And, Dana, if you could talk about the young boy in 1970 - it's not only children, thousands who died at these schools - but those who tried to escape?\n\nDANA HEDGPETH : That's right. The story of Johnson Kee West, who tried to escape to go back home, there were, sadly, many stories like his, dozens of stories of children who tried to run away from these schools and make it back to their homeland. The thing I'll never forget about his death, sadly, is that on his death certificate, it was marked as \"frozen.\" He died trying to get across a mesa, snow-covered hills, a mesa, back to his homeland.\n\nI don't think any of us can really fathom, A, being taken from your home at a young age. Some of these children were as young as 5. Some of them were older teens who stayed at the school because they wanted them to be part of the forced manual labor that these children were required to do at these schools. One of our sources called these not schools, but, rather, prison camps. They were work camps. They were not meant to educate Native American students to become doctors or lawyers. They were meant to \"educate\" them - I say \"educate\" with air quotes - \"educate\" them in manual labor. Often the students were reported to be two, three years behind academically. Some students who survived these schools talk of coming home and having skills that were completely unusable in their communities, if they managed to survive them, or just not being able to speak their tribal language anymore and really being out of sorts, having been away from their homes for so long.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Dana Hedgpeth, we only have about a minute left. How has the impact of these schools, closed at the beginning of the '70s, impacted, what, half a century later?\n\nDANA HEDGPETH : Wow, that's a good question and a big one. The impact of these schools is still being felt in many ways. As I mentioned, there are several hundred survivors from these schools. They're dealing with the traumas of having gone through these schools, of having been taken away from their tribe, their communities, their families. That has a generational impact on how they raise their children or how they did not know how to raise their children, of grappling what it means to be away from your home, away from your community, away from your traditions, away from your language. That's left a huge knowledge gap, as we Native Americans call it, in language and in culture. There is a rebuilding of those languages and of those culture traditions. But still it is very, very hard to deal with that trauma. Many Native American survivors are only now beginning to talk about these traumas from decades ago.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We want to -\n\nDANA HEDGPETH : And a lot of that is to do with the reckoning.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We want to thank you for being with us. And unfortunately, we've run out of time. But your work is incredible. And we're going to link to your articles .

I'm Amy Goodman, with Nermeen Shaikh.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : We continue to look at Senator Elizabeth Warren's claims to Native American ancestry. She's come under fire since releasing a DNA test showing Native American lineage in her family tree. In a video released Monday, she told her family's story.\n\nSEN . ELIZABETH WARREN : My mother was born in eastern Oklahoma. It had been Indian territory until just a few years earlier, when it had become a state. My daddy always said he fell head over heels in love with my mother the first time he saw her. But my daddy's parents, the Herrings, were bitterly opposed to their marrying, because my mother's family, the Reeds, was part Native American. This sort of discrimination was common at the time. So when my mama was 19 and my daddy was 20, they eloped. And together they built a family-my three older brothers and me.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Elizabeth Warren has said her mother told her family had ties to the Cherokee and Delaware tribes. But Native Americans across the country are criticizing Warren's decision to use a DNA test to assert her heritage. Chuck Hoskin Jr., secretary of state for the Cherokee Nation, said, quote, \"Sovereign tribal nations set their own legal requirements for citizenship, and while DNA tests can be used to determine lineage, such as paternity to an individual, it is not evidence for tribal affiliation. Using a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation, even vaguely, is inappropriate and wrong.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : For more, we host a roundtable discussion. Joining us from Fargo, North Dakota is Tara Houska, national campaign director for Honor the Earth. She's an Ojibwe lawyer. And we go to Anchorage, Alaska, where we're joined by Mark Trahant, who is editor of Indian Country Today , a member of the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes. In Seattle, Washington, we're joined by Gyasi Ross, author, speaker, lawyer and storyteller, member of the Blackfeet Nation, host of the podcast Breakdances with Wolves .\n\nWe welcome you all to Democracy Now! Let's go to North Dakota to Tara Houska. If you can respond first to Senator Warren releasing her DNA test, indicating Native American lineage, and her video, and your thoughts on this?\n\nTARA HOUSKA : What I see are some non-Native folks arguing over what Native identity is, and Native people just being almost entirely left out of the conversation. So we saw that Lindsey Graham now is running around saying, you know, that \"I have more Indian blood than she does; I should open a casino.\" It kind of shows just how problematic Senator Warren's decision to use this DNA test as her smoking gun-\"Now, see? I'm Native. I said I was\"-when in fact, common genetic markers and geographic location does not tell you anything about which tribe you might be part of or that you might have descendancy from. She couldn't actually locate an ancestor, having done a genealogy study, who is a Native person. It's kind of this one drop rule, that she's reinforcing all these understandings of race being something by blood and there being this difference between different ethnicities. So-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Let's go to Senator Warren in her own words, in that video that she released on Monday, talking about her Native American heritage.\n\nSEN . ELIZABETH WARREN : I'm not enrolled in a tribe, and only tribes determine tribal citizenship. I understand and respect that distinction, but my family history is my family history.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : So, that's Elizabeth Warren, Tara. Can you respond to that and also explain how is it that Native American tribes determine membership?\n\nTARA HOUSKA : Yeah. You know, I think she's kind of walking back her words because she got this really harsh statement by Cherokee Nation, who is saying that this is really disrespectful and has nothing to do with their sovereign right to determine membership. I don't think that she's very regretful about this. I think that she has just kind of bowled her way forward on this issue.\n\nAnd, you know, yeah, it's a sovereign right of tribal nations to determine who is a member. It is relationships of kinship, of community, of a lived experience. It's all kinds of different factors that sometimes can include blood quantum, but blood quantum is something that was created by the colonial government, not by tribal nations. And it's this kind of myth that's been perpetuated by the United States and by many, many Americans who claim to be, quote-unquote, \"part Cherokee\" and continue these problematic ideas of who Native people are and were.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Let's turn to Republican Senator Lindsey Graham on Fox & Friends Tuesday, saying he plans to take a DNA test in response to Senator Warren.\n\nSEN . LINDSEY GRAHAM : I'm going to take a DNA test. All of you have. I've been told that my grandmother was part Cherokee Indian. It may all be just talk, but you're going to find out in a couple weeks, because I'm going to take this test.\n\nBRIAN KILMEADE : You are going to take it?\n\nSEN . LINDSEY GRAHAM : I'm taking it, and the result's going to be revealed here. This is my Trump moment. This is reality TV.\n\nAINSLEY EARHARDT : Why do you want to take-why do you want to do this?\n\nSEN . LINDSEY GRAHAM : I just-I'm dying to know, 'cause-I'm dying-you know, I didn't really think much about it, but she's less than one-tenth of 1 percent. I think I can beat her. I think I can beat her.\n\nBRIAN KILMEADE : Right. And if you do beat her, will you ask for a million dollars from the president, too?\n\nSEN . LINDSEY GRAHAM : No, I want a casino and a million bucks.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : \"I want a casino and a million bucks.\" Tara Houska, that was Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina.\n\nTARA HOUSKA : Yeah, it's incredibly disrespectful and, you know, just really shows how Warren's behavior, although it's less crude than some of the comments that have made by Donald Trump about, you know, Pocahontas and demeaning women-it's this historic figure and making that into somehow a slur-her behavior is less crude, but it's still problematic, and it's still a complete misunderstanding of what Native identity actually is, and it perpetuates this myth that so many people hold. I mean, you live on the East Coast, and you hear almost everyone having this story of being \"part Cherokee on their mother's side,\" when there are real Cherokee people who still live today. And we should respect that and understand who Native people really are.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, I'd like to bring in Mark Trahant from Anchorage, Alaska. Could you also comment on this controversy? You've been extremely critical of the fact that Elizabeth Warren has released-has taken a DNA test and released it. Could you explain what your problem with this is, your criticism?\n\nMARK TRAHANT : Well, the DNA test itself is just another use of a colonial narrative, basically. The ultimate goal of a DNA test is to prove that Indians are immigrants like everybody else. And again, it takes away from the idea that there's a tribal community with a governing institution that's been around before the United States. And there are reasons that tribes are around with 10,000-year histories in North America.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, Mark, could you explain what you mean by that, that DNA tests are there to prove that indigenous people, Native Americans, are immigrants like everyone else? Why?\n\nMARK TRAHANT : Kim TallBear, who has written quite a bit about this, has talked about that, that it's basically coming up with a narrative that says use-figure out where folks came from originally and trying to figure that out rather than to connect with the stories. I mean, Shoshone-Bannock, for example, one of the things that just I love about my own people is that if you look at the history of North America, we once hunted mastodon. And you think about that as an arc of history that goes back many generations, that is much deeper than a test that you can use.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : And you even suggested, Mark, that her releasing her DNA test kind of disqualifies her to be president. Could you explain that?\n\nMARK TRAHANT : Sure. I mean, campaigns are about stories and what story you're going to tell about yourself. And here we are less than three weeks away from an extraordinary election, and we're talking about this instead of the extraordinary election. I think, just from a strategic point of view, that makes no sense.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Let's go to Gyasi Ross in Seattle, author, lawyer, member of the Blackfeet Nation. As you watch this from the Northwest, Gyasi, talk about your response, not only to Senator Warren doing the DNA test and all the ways she has variously represented herself, but also Donald Trump and his comments about her, continually, right through this week, talking about Pocahontas.\n\nGYASI ROSS : Thank you, and good morning. Thank you for having all of us. It's good to be on this very esteemed panel.\n\nYou know, I had a few reactions. Number one is one concerning the media generally. And it would be nice to have, quote-unquote, \"Native stories,\" Native-themed stories, that weren't centered on white people. That's something that's very common, whether you're talking about Hollywood- Dances with Wolves , Little Big Man -Elizabeth Warren. Every single time we see Natives in mass media, it's in response to white people doing something really, really stupid or saving our communities. And that's a false narrative. And so, it would be nice to see our communities, that are actually pushing for an amazing recovery, relationship to economics, in relationship to education, in relationship to language, actually have that centered around a story, as opposed to around a white person and the Native people being collateral to that white person.\n\nAlso, a reaction is that, you know, Elizabeth Warren, obviously, she wants to be an ally, but she doesn't want to be an accomplice, meaning that she is still willing to make Native people political fodder for her own political survival. As Mark pointed out, you have Native women that are running historic numbers and doing historic things in this particular 2019 election-Sharice Davids in Kansas, Deb Haaland in New Mexico, Paulette Jordan running for governor of Idaho. But yet, with all of these amazing Native women's stories, this white woman wants to center this Indian narrative, this Native narrative in politics, around her, as opposed to going out and campaigning for them two weeks in advance of the 2018 elections. And to-excuse me-and to me, that does make me question her judgment. We definitely, rightfully, condemn Donald Trump for his emotionality and his tempestuousness and unpredictability, but she does a Maury Povich-like spectacle revealing her DNA results as opposed to doing the actual work of a leader.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You mentioned, Gyasi, Deb Haaland. I want to turn to what she said, the Democratic candidate for Congress in New Mexico, who could become the first Native woman to serve in Congress. She tweeted this week, \"Senator Elizabeth Warren's DNA test confirms the family history she has long shared with the world, and I acknowledge her Native ancestry as testament to who we are as Americans. The oppression that Native people have experienced over the course of our history caused many Native American families to deny their heritage, language, and culture, and I understand why this was the case with her family. Senator Warren has been a sister in the struggle for years for Indigenous peoples' rights, and for all of us who weren't born into the top 1%. The revelation of Senator Warren's Native American ancestry is significant for her personally, and I join her in celebrating her ancestry.\" That is the quote of the Native American congressional candidate, Democratic candidate in New Mexico, who could well become the first Native American congressmember [ sic ]. Your response to what she says, Gyasi? Congresswoman. She'd be the first congresswoman.\n\nGYASI ROSS : Well, it's a typical-and I believe that her and Sharice Davids will co-occupy that title as the first Native congresspeople in the House. And that's going to be an amazing celebration and wonderful, wonderful event for United States politics and United States history generally. But for Congresswoman Haaland, that is a typically gracious and amazingly brilliant response. And absolutely, I'm sure she does celebrate, just like all of us-cool, if you want to be into the fold socially, that's a beautiful thing. You want to find out why-you know, this is the year of the Native woman, and Elizabeth Warren evidently wanted to upgrade herself, you know, Beyoncé-style.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that it requires these Maury Povich-like theatrics in which they do it and disrupt a flow, where Native women are rightfully getting a lot of attention politically and a lot of resources politically, and do this, as opposed to doing the work. It's an incredibly gracious and generous response from Congresswoman Haaland, but that doesn't mean that the timing is correct, number one, nor that it wasn't something that she necessarily thought out or her people thought out properly.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And your response to Trump saying he'll give her a million dollars if she takes a DNA test, and now saying, \"I never said anything like that\"?\n\nGYASI ROSS : Trump's a pig. I mean, he's a liar. So, that shouldn't surprise us. I think both of them, for making Native ancestry into a spectacle, into a three-ring circus, in which non-Natives-and specifically white people, by the way-feel completely emboldened to posit their opinions and actually challenge Native people about Native ancestry-Elizabeth Warren and Donald Trump both opened that door. And so, I believe that both of them should donate a million dollars to the National Indian Women's Resource Center, you know, because both of them helped create this spectacle, and both of them have an obligation to Native women, I believe.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're going to break and then come back to this discussion. We're talking to Gyasi Ross, author, lawyer, member of Blackfeet Nation, speaking to us from Seattle, Washington; Tara Houska with Honor the Earth, Ojibwe lawyer, speaking to us from Fargo, North Dakota; and Mark Trahant, editor of Indian Country Today , speaking to us from Anchorage, Alaska.

This year is dedicated to water protectors at Standing Rock and to the struggle for recognition of Indigenous Peoples' Day. To discuss this and more, we're joined in San Francisco by indigenous historian and activist Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz. She's the author of An Indigenous Peoples' History of the United States and co-author of All the Real Indians Died Off: And 20 Other Myths About Native Americans .\n\nWelcome back to Democracy Now! , Roxanne. Could you tell us, as the nation prepares to observe Thanksgiving, a national holiday ostensibly meant to honor Native people, what are your thoughts?\n\nROXANNE DUNBAR - ORTIZ : Well, thank you for having me on the show.\n\nActually, it's never been about honoring Native Americans. It's been about the origin story of the United States, the beginning of genocide, dispossession and constant warfare from that time-actually, from 1607 in Jamestown-until the present. It's a colonial system that was set up.\n\nThere's a sort of annual calendar for this origin story, beginning with Columbus, October 12. Why celebrate Columbus? It was the onset of colonialism, the slave trade and dispossession of the Native people of the Americas. So, that is celebrated with a federal holiday. That's followed then by Thanksgiving, which is a completely made-up story to say the Native people welcomed these people who were going to devastate their civilizations, which is simply a lie. And then you go to Presidents' Days, the Founding Fathers, in February, and celebrate these slaveowners, Indian killers. George Washington headed the Virginia militia for the very purpose of killing Native people on the periphery of the colony, before, you know, when it was still a Virginia colony. And then we have the big day, the fireworks, July 4th, independence, which is probably the most tragic event in world history, because it gave us-it gave the world a genocidal regime under the guise of democracy. And that's really the-I'm a historian, so that's the historical context that I think we have to see Thanksgiving in, that it is a part of that mythology that attempts to cover up the real history of the United States.\n\nIt actually-when it was introduced as a holiday by Abraham Lincoln during the Civil War, there was no mention of pilgrims and Native people or food or pumpkins or anything like that. It was simply a day for families to be together and mourn their dead and be grateful for the living. And I think that's an appropriate holiday, that-how people should enjoy it. But they should take Native Americans and Puritans out of the picture for it to be a legitimate holiday of feast and sharing with family and friends.\n\nSo, that's-you know, the people at Plymouth, I send greetings to them. They have, for many years-I think it's almost 40 years now-stood up and testified to the lie of Plymouth Rock, the Mayflower , the pilgrims. And this is very hard for people to give up. This is the national-nationalism. It's actually-Americanism is white supremacy and represents negative things. There's almost no way to reconcile it. It simply has to be deconstructed and faced up to; and, otherwise, there will be no social change that's meaningful for anyone.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz, thank you so much for joining us, indigenous historian and activist.\n\nThat does it for today's show. Tune in tomorrow for our Standing Rock special.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Investigative journalist Jenni Monet says that for many tribal citizens, the contest is not just about Democrats and Republicans. These voters \"support those who understand their sovereignty,\" says Monet, who writes the newsletter \"Indigenously.\" She is a tribal citizen of the Pueblo of Laguna.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! The Quarantine Report . I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nWe turn now to look at how Native American voters could sway key Senate races in next week's election in Montana, North Carolina, Arizona and Maine, and how the presidential candidates are courting the Native vote. In North Carolina, the Lumbee Tribe could hold significant influence on the Senate showdown between Republican incumbent Thom Tillis and Democratic challenger Cal Cunningham. The Lumbees, who voted for Donald Trump in 2016, could also prove to be a key vote in the presidential race. The Lumbee Tribe is one of two tribes in North Carolina, but it lacks federal recognition. Both Joe Biden and Donald Trump have pledged to recognize the tribe, if elected. On Saturday, Trump campaigned in Lumberton, North Carolina.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : With us today are members of the incredible Lumbee Tribe, which has been wrongly denied federal recognition for more than a century. ... When I'm reelected, I will probably sign the Lumbee Recognition Act. It should have been signed a long time ago.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Another state to watch is Montana, where Republican incumbent U.S. Senator Steve Daines is running against the state's governor, Steve Bullock. Native voters make up 7% of Montana's electorate.\n\nWell, for more on these races, voter suppression in Indian Country, and the record number of Native candidates running for office, from local to national races, we go to Santa Fe, New Mexico, where we're joined by investigative journalist Jenni Monet, founder of the newsletter Indigenously: Decolonizing Your Newsfeed and a tribal citizen of the Pueblo of Laguna, her recent piece for Medium headlined \"The Native Voters Who Could Decide Control of the Senate.\"\n\nJenni Monet, welcome back to Democracy Now! You write in your piece, \"Across Indian Country, Native voters have been known to pack a powerful punch at the polls in some of the most narrowest political victories - and not with any particular party loyalty. For tribal citizens, elections aren't determined by values that run red or blue, but rather those that run sovereign.\" Explain what you mean, and go through the races that you are watching most closely, Jenni.\n\nJENNI MONET : Well, I made that statement only in that we know, in certain key states with large Native American, Alaska Native populations, that voters support those who understand their sovereignty, who understand their very unique needs. And I think one most obvious example of that is in Alaska. We saw in 2010 an extraordinary and unprecedented show at the polls, where Senator Lisa Murkowski was forced into a write-in candidacy. And to this day, it's largely credited that it was Alaska Natives who mobilized to give her those write-in votes that she needed, also with some of the Alaska Native corporation financial support in terms of supporting that campaign.\n\nLikewise, what we're seeing now here in Indian Country, you're seeing in Montana, in particular, a race that I'm closely watching, a mobilization of Native voters there, where as many as five Native Indigenous-led organizations have vowed to unseat Senator Daines and support Governor Bullock for that position. And it really comes down to, I think, a disappointment among Native voters in Montana, who, as you said, represent the largest minority in the state, 7%, to which some of the decisions that Daines made really struck hard on daily life for Indian Country. One editorial in the Billings Gazette was by a Crow tribal citizen who still hasn't forgotten Daines' support of the government shutdown in 2013 and how that impacted daily tribal life for citizens there.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And talk about the concerns there, overall, and when you talk about the idea that Native Americans could determine the balance of the Senate, not just any particular race.\n\nJENNI MONET : So, we understand that Native American voter population is small; however, it is significant. Another key, significant race happened in South Dakota in the early aughts, where a Democratic senator had been in the closest race, and it wasn't until votes were tallied from the Oglala Nation, of around 500 votes tallied, that he squeaked by in a narrow election. We saw that also in North Dakota with Senator Heidi Heitkamp's win in 2012.\n\nAnd so, when we're looking at the significance of the Native vote in 2020, in terms of looking at these very critical battleground states to flip the Senate, I wrote about four key races where Native voter populations are small but significant, including Montana, but also North Carolina, where we are seeing two presidential candidates for the first time really courting Native voters in a very public way and dangling sovereignty out for everyone to see. And I think it's just an extraordinary - it will be an extraordinary race to watch, because Robeson County, home of the Lumbee Tribe, has been a swing vote in the last 2016 election. They represent 40% of the population in Robeson County and voted roughly 5% of the vote, which carried Trump in that county. And so, now when they have prospects of two presidential candidates both promising their sovereignty to full force, it will be very interesting to see how that might shake out. I don't know if you noticed this, but Trump was scheduled to return back to North Carolina just yesterday and was postponing that trip due to windy weather. But it's slated that he will make his last - one of his last campaign speeches back in Lumbee country, in Columbus County, on Monday.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And, Jenni Monet, can you talk about the Senate race in Maine, where you have the incumbent senator, the Republican Susan Collins, who is facing a very stiff challenge from Sara Gideon, and the role of Native voters in Maine?\n\nJENNI MONET : Right. There's some are saying that this is Susan Collins' fight - you know, the fight of her life. And Sara Gideon, who is also speaker of the Maine Legislature, she last year came out in rare support for the four Indigenous tribes that are based in Maine.\n\nAnd the backstory is one that has languished in Maine for the last 40 years, dealing with a land settlement that has really just carried a lot of animosity between tribal-state relations, and it's just never been resolved. In fact, it's exacerbated a lot of problems. And in Maine, it's one of the states where tribes themselves are trying to exercise their full sovereignty under a lot of grip from the state.\n\nAnd Sara Gideon understands that and has actually seen the Maine tribes in a way that, you know, Maine, which is one of the whitest states, if not the whitest state, in America, has refused to really acknowledge tribes and their sovereignty. And so, even though voters in Maine represent barely 1% of the voting population, if this race should be close, as the polls suggest it is, it might be one of those close ties where the Native vote could be very significant.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Jenni, let's talk also about Native candidates all over the country, a record number of people running, and also what it means to vote or to hold these elections during COVID , because Native Americans are among, among the Latinx and African Americans, the hardest hit by this virus.\n\nJENNI MONET : Amy, there have been at least - what we know - at least five lawsuits this year alone around voter suppression rights - stomping out voter suppression and upholding voting rights for Native Americans. And all but one have really successfully been in favor of tribes. In Montana, actually, they were trying to challenge a collection ballot that was actually a provision in their 2018 midterms. And what we saw in Arizona, there were two cases, actually. One was a mail-in referendum, to which a plaintiff was trying to extend the delivery status of that, and that got overturned. And then another happened in Pima County, where a early voting precinct on the Pascua Yaqui Reservation got shut down. And what we're talking about are measures that are so vital, predating the pandemic, but in a pandemic, where people's safety and lives are at stake, particularly in some of the hardest-hit communities for the coronavirus. And here, if there ever was a time for these measures to be in place, it would be now. And they're being struck down, time after time.\n\nAnd one, you talk about the historic candidates running. Sure, they're running in big races right now, but I find - what I find very fascinating and intriguing is that it's also these little races that are going to pack a huge punch, particularly in Pima County, where that early voting precinct closed, where you have a young woman, Gabriella Cázares-Kelly, who is running for the county recorder position. And, come on, how often are we really paying attention to county recorder positions? But in this case, where you have had extreme voter suppression, where felons are arrested and incarcerated and overrepresented in the state's prisons more than any other group, here you have an informed Indigenous woman who has seen this kind of disparity on the ground for years, and when she saw the county recorder, who's been in that position for almost three decades, she jumped at the opportunity to step in and start really reforming some of this systemic racism that's been in these organizations.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And speaking about those kind of very local races, similarly, in South Dakota, the Public Utilities Commission, Remi Bald Eagle running. And I should say, Jenni, that you were arrested in North Dakota covering the Dakota Access Pipeline protests, as well.\n\nJENNI MONET : As were you, Amy. And yeah, you know, this week, we were reminded of a very dear anniversary from the No DAPL protest, where, on October 27th, we saw the militarized police raid taking over one of the encampments that was in the path of the pipeline. And so it's very top of mind for Indian Country right now, what is driving people to the polls.\n\nAnd for South Dakota, you know, another small race is for a seat for the Public Utilities Commission, where Remi Bald Eagle of the Cheyenne River Sioux, who was an organizer, as well, in the No DAPL protests, he is now running for one of those seats, which only open up every six years. And a big part of his campaign is that he's advocating for the land, a plaintiff that he says doesn't have a voice, and so it's up to us to do that. And as you know, these public utility commissions in the Dakotas determine the permitting for pipeline projects and other infrastructure projects that deal with, you know, natural resource extraction projects throughout and around tribal lands, and so it's very important to the tribal citizenry up there.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The Dakotas are among the worst hit by the COVID virus right now, in the red zone.\n\nJENNI MONET : Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Finally, the lack of data on Native voters, can you end there, Jenni?\n\nJENNI MONET : Yeah. I think what's so fascinating right now is that there's this notion that Native voters have been somewhat apathetic at the polls. And I think that that is a distortion of the data.\n\nWe found out, in our coverage so far, that the midterm 2018 elections had a robust display of various ethnic groups that showed up at the polls. And when we talked with the census takers, they told us that Native Americans weren't documented in the data because we were too small of a group to count. And that happens quite often. We saw that happen with missing and murdered Indigenous women. We see that happen with health statistics, and on and on. There's a thing called \"Asterisk Nation\" for the data crisis that we're in.\n\nAnd so, I actually applaud some of the Native organizations in Indian Country right now who are kind of riding a very data sovereignty movement right now. Just this week, there was a report released by two nonprofit organizations, IllumiNative and Native Organizers Alliance, and they polled around 6,400 people and found that 77% of the roughly 6,400 people participated in the last election. And I don't see that as apathetic at all. And so, I think that this narrative of somehow Natives are chronically not showing up at the polls is false. And I hope that this 2020 election can shine some light on that.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Jenni Monet, I want to thank you for being with us, investigative journalist, founder of the newsletter Indigenously: Decolonizing Your Newsfeed . Jenni is a tribal citizen of the Pueblo of Laguna, speaking to us from Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n\nComing up, Jesse Wegman on, well, his new book, Let the People Pick the President: The Case for Abolishing the Electoral College . Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

He is a spokesperson for the Indigenous Peoples March.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman in Los Angeles, with Juan González in New York.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: We continue to look at the video that has gone viral showing a group of Catholic high school students apparently mocking an indigenous tribal leader near the Lincoln Memorial. The students, many of whom were wearing \"Make America Great Again\" hats, had just attended the March for Life. Omaha elder Nathan Phillips was attending the Indigenous Peoples March.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're joined now by Chase Iron Eyes, an activist, lead attorney for the Lakota People's Law Project, spokesperson for the Indigenous Peoples March.\n\nThank you for joining us from South Dakota. You just came back from Washington, D.C., Chase. You were there. I mean, this was the end of the march, well after, but you witnessed what took place. Now the world has seen the video. And some have said, well, this whole story changed once the young man in the video, who is smiling in front of Omaha elder Nathan Phillips-once he issued a statement saying that he was not hostile, he was trying to defuse the situation. Chase, can you describe what you watched, where you were standing?\n\nCHASE IRON EYES : Yes. Thank you for covering this, again, and thank you, for Nathan, for offering his song today and on Friday, right after the Indigenous Peoples March, the first inaugural.\n\nI'm not quite sure what time it was when the whole incident went down, because we had finished our march early. And we had a permit to be there at the Lincoln Memorial. It would have ended around 5:00, so it would be interesting to look at the time frames. Nonetheless, where the indigenous singers, including Nathan Phillips, including Raymond Kingfisher and about four other supporters-I mean, they were very small in number, and they were closing out the ceremonies, because that was-I was standing right there near them, waiting for my daughter, who was at the top of the Lincoln Memorial. Now, at the top of the Lincoln Memorial, it's a good, you know, 100 meters away from where Nathan Phillips was, and even where the Black Israelites were.\n\nThe Black Israelites were just trying to offend any and everybody who came within earshot of them. And so we expelled them or denied them from our space at the Indigenous Peoples March. They were trying to speak, but we said, \"No, just go over here. And, you know, as long as you're not trying to exert violence or come into our space anymore, we'll leave you alone.\" So that's what we did. And you've got to realize that the Black Israelites and the Native people were at the bottom, the very bottom, of the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nThe MAGA swag hat-wearing kids, who were attending a different rally, here's a hundred or so frenzied, young men who are attending a rally to deny women the right to assert sovereignty over their own bodies. They were brought there by the Covington Catholic Church. They were all donning their little MAGA swag hats. And the truth is, they were roaming around there for a long time. I don't know how many minutes, but the new video surfaced of the Black Israelites, you know, doing what they did and offending everybody they possibly could. But other video also surfaced showing the MAGA swag kids verbally accosting passersby, women, others, appropriating the haka dance and so forth. And if you could-if there was drone footage possibly of a hundred-foot view, you'd be able to see that the MAGA swag kids, the Covington Catholic kids, invade the space of where Nathan and the Black Israelites are standing. And so, they come closer to the Israelites and are there being disruptive, being very loud. It's a very tense situation. When they get closer, I move away. I actually moved away from, you know, close proximity, because I was honestly concerned for my own safety, and at that time I did not know where my daughter was.\n\nBut now you have PR firms. You have people trying to spin this each and every way, even in mainstream media. And people are looking past the fact that there was a racially charged environment. You have young kids who are representing the President of the United States Donald Trump's campaign slogan, \"Make America Great Again.\" We're in a country that-where Native Americans, or the original civilizers, tribal nations, however you want to term that, we occupy-we have to occupy a certain space in the American imagination, the Western imagination. We are-according to that mythology, that worldview, we are the savage, we are the primitive, we are uncivilized, we are antithetical to progress. And so, if you combine that with the mascotry, with the caricaturization that exists with not only institutions, including Hollywood, and all the educational materials that are out there, that tell us, you know, Indians were half-naked roaming the plains, they weren't civilized, this land was pristine, it was virgin, it was manifest destiny, it was our God-given right to come out here, you know, Indians kind of showed up at Thanksgiving and blessed us with the first meal-you know, this is the history that we learn. This is part of our identity, part of our mythology. Our cultural mythology as Americans contemplates the genocide of American Indians, the slavery of black folks.\n\nAnd so, we're in the nation's capital. You have a president who constantly uses Pocahontas as a racial slur and also a denigration against the epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous women, because Pocahontas was a victim of child rape and kidnapping. Then you have the president making light and being flippantly dehumanizing and offensive about our genocide here in Lakota Country. You know, my family literally survived Wounded Knee. And so, when he says the things he does, he gives license to young, impressionable minds. And though-you know, through all this spin, our elder, Nathan Phillips, sought to offer his song, his prayer, his peace, to prevent a violent situation. And that's what happened.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, Chase, we don't have much time. We don't have much time, but I wanted to ask-you were there. You saw all the students there from the Kentucky Covington Catholic high school. Did you see adults? Were you concerned the situation was going to get out of hand?\n\nCHASE IRON EYES : I was very concerned that it was going to get out of hand. It was like a tinderbox. There were so many youth jumping up and down, jeering. It was a mob frenzy. They were ridiculing. They were exhibiting nothing but contempt and scorn for one of our elders, who was offering a peaceful and prayerful song. And I looked for adults. If they were there, they were wearing MAGA hats, too, and encouraging this delinquency that these young people-and I'll give them that: When I looked at them, I saw young children, impressionable young spirits and minds, who need right now, at this time, rather than fight over all the spin and all the angles and facts and controverted everything, we need the adults in the room. That includes our elder Nathan Phillips. That includes the archdiocese of the Covington Catholics. That could potentially include Pope Francis. Donald Trump is tweeting about it. We have a very special and tremendous opportunity to let the spirit guide the political, racial, social discourse that we're engaged in here, in a fight for the heart and soul of our country right now.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Chase, Chase Iron Eyes, I wanted to ask you-you're talking about the importance of adults stepping up. There were two-there are now two Native American women in Congress who weighed in on what happened. Can you talk about the importance of their being in the new Congress?\n\nCHASE IRON EYES : Yes, well, we don't have to convince them that tribal sovereignty is a good thing, that missing and murdered indigenous women need to be tracked, they need their voice amplified. We don't have to educate them of how the patriarchy objectifies and oppresses females worldwide. We support them in ending the government shutdown. We support AOC , Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, enforcing a Green New Deal. We feel that, as tribal nations, our Green New Deal is a million years old. And we're glad to see more than a hundred new women in the halls of Congress completely changing the energy and the dynamic. As you can see, you know, some of those forces are trying to, quote-unquote, \"rein in\" AOC , Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. But now more than ever, we here, in tribal nations, on the streets, on the rez, at the grassroots level, need to be as loud as we can, project as much positive force as we can, so they know that they can be as bold as we know they want to be.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Chase Iron Eyes, we want to thank you so much for being with us, activist, lead attorney for the Lakota People's Law Project, spokesperson for the Indigenous Peoples March.\n\nThis is Democracy Now!

The book's powerful mix of memoir, extensive interview and storytelling presents decades of indigenous history that have been sidelined by the mainstream. It takes its name from Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee , the 1970 book by Dee Brown that tells the story of the Wounded Knee massacre.\n\nIn his book's prologue, David Treuer writes, quote, \"This book tells the story of what Indians in the United States have been up to in the 128 years that have elapsed since the 1890 massacre of at least 150 Lakota Sioux at Wounded Knee Creek in South Dakota: what we've done, what's happened to us, what our lives have been like. It is adamantly, unashamedly, about Indian life rather than Indian death. That we even have lives-that Indians have been living in, have been shaped by, and in turn have shaped the modern world-is news to most people.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : David Treuer is Ojibwe from the Leech Lake Reservation in northern Minnesota. He teaches literature and creative writing at the University of Southern California. His new book, out today, The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee: Native America from 1890 to the Present . He joins us here in Los Angeles.\n\nDavid, welcome to Democracy Now! Before we go into your book, although I think this very much fits in with what you write about, can you respond to what took place this weekend, and if you feel, with the statement of the student Nick Sandmann saying he meant no harm, was trying to defuse the situation, that this changes the image of what we saw on video of the Omaha elder, Nathan Phillips, as he drummed, surrounded by these young high school students from Kentucky?\n\nDAVID TREUER : [inaudible] Nathan's-I'm sorry, when I heard Sandmann's statement, that sounded like a statement crafted by a PR firm, didn't sound like the statement of a high school junior. And after the initial outrage, of course, we hear cries from the other side about the need for context. And there is a need for context. Covington, that school, has been accused of dressing up in blackface during basketball games. And they were-you know, let's not forget the context that brought them to D.C. in the first place. You had a bunch of high school boys coming to D.C. to tell grown women what they should or shouldn't do with their bodies, and while wearing MAGA hats. So, yeah, we need more context, and I'm glad we're getting it now.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, David Treuer, why do think this incident has touched such a nerve across the country?\n\nDAVID TREUER : Well, a couple of reasons, right? That nerve has been jangling for centuries. It's only now that maybe parts of the country are hearing it. And, of course, you know, that nerve has been further inflamed by the ways in which social media is designed to amplify pain. And that's certainly happening. But hopefully we can use it to think more carefully and more deeply about what our country is and what we want it to be like.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Talk about the title of your book and what you are trying to convey as an indigenous writer, a Native American writer. Your book, The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee , why you even titled it that?\n\nDAVID TREUER : Well, it's something that I've experienced, growing up at Leech Lake and going to grade school, middle school and high school in a border town, in Bemidji, Minnesota, and it's something that I think a lot of Native people have experienced, is a really profound and punishing way in which people think of us as being dead.\n\nWhen my brother went to university, someone asked him, \"Well, what are you? Where are you from?\" And he said, \"Well, I'm Native. I'm Ojibwe from Leech Lake Reservation.\" And the woman he was talking to said, \"Well, you're Indian?\" He said, \"Yeah.\" She said, \"Well, you can't be.\" And he said, \"Why not?\" And she said, \"Because we killed all of you.\" She couldn't even accept the fact that he was standing there, living and breathing-and excelling and achieving, no less. In her mind, in her imagination, real Indians are dead Indians.\n\nAnd so, I wanted to write a book that I could use to show people that not only are we still alive, we're not merely surviving.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, David Treuer-\n\nDAVID TREUER : But the-yeah.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: You also seek, through the book, to demolish many of the myths that still prevail about Native Americans. What are some of those myths that you especially try to hone in on?\n\nDAVID TREUER : Well, that was one of them. One of them is that after 1890, in the popular imagination-and we share this. We share this imagination. Native people, I think, we've been trained and we've learned to see ourselves this way, too. But in the popular imagination, 1890 was the end point. Dee Brown says in his book, \"I end my story in 1890 at the massacre at Wounded Knee, where the culture and civilization of the American Indian was finally destroyed.\" I remember reading that in college and thinking, \"I'm not destroyed. My culture isn't destroyed. My community isn't destroyed.\" And that's one of the biggest myths. One of the biggest fantasies about us is that after 1890, even though we might have been alive, all we've been doing is living some sort of painful afterlife. And what I wanted to show was, one, that we've been doing incredible things. Our strategies for survival have been complex and layered and intelligent. That's one thing.\n\nAnd the other thing is that not only have we been sort of shaped by America, but that America has been shaped by us. I mean, and I really believe this to be true, but I don't think you can get a full measure of what this country is or what it's about, much less understand its history, without thinking about Native people. I mean, let's face it. At the Boston Tea Party, it wasn't just that colonists threw tea in Boston Harbor; they dressed up as Native people, in buckskins and kastowa and face paint, and then they threw tea in the harbor. Since its first revolutionary act, America has understood itself as existing in relation to us, and it has learned from us as much as we've learned from it. That's the other thing I wanted to do in this book.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Some of the myths, that Native Americans are living in rural areas much more so than urban-you turn that around.\n\nDAVID TREUER : Yeah. I mean, Native people live on reservations, we live in border towns, we live in suburbs, and we live in cities. We are as spread out across the country and as migratory as anyone else.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And finally, David, your-how you want the media to cover Native America-I mean, Native American communities-not just in response to MAGA hats or how President Trump describes Elizabeth Warren?\n\nDAVID TREUER : Well, there's this tendency to sort of only think about us or to only read stuff about us or listen to our music or to watch us on the news as a kind of liberal act, as almost as a kind of community service. And the way I want to correct the media is sort of the way I want to correct all of us in how we understand our Native communities, which is as vital, alive, interesting and important to the country.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: One of the people that you focus in on in your book is Helen Bryan Johnson, whose refusal to pay $147 taxes on her reservation trailer home led to a landmark Supreme Court decision. Could you talk about her and her importance to the modern Native American life?\n\nDAVID TREUER : Oh, yeah, that's exactly right. So, in the 1970s, Helen Bryan was living in a trailer on the Leech Lake Reservation, my reservation, and someone rolled up in her yard and started taking pictures of her trailer, and she couldn't figure out why, and then they left. And then, some months later, she got a tax bill from the county. And she thought to herself, \"Why are they assessing a tax on my trailer? This is Indian land, and I'm a Native person, and this doesn't feel fair. This doesn't feel right.\" The tax bill was for $147, by the way. And Helen was, you know, a mother of, I think, five or six kids at the time. She worked for Head Start. She earned minimum wage. She could barely make ends meet. So, for her, a $147 tax bill was a massive-a big problem for her.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : David, we have 10 seconds.\n\nDAVID TREUER : And she fought it in court, and it went all the way to the Supreme Court. And they ruled in her favor, and that opened the way for Indian gaming.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : But we're going to do Part 2 of this conversation. This book is too important, The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee: Native America from 1890 to the Present , by David Treuer.\n\nThat does it for our program. This news: The Oscars have been announced. For best documentary: Free Solo ; Hale County This Morning, This Evening ; Minding the Gap ; Of Fathers and Sons ; and RBG . Congratulations for all. Those are the Oscar nominees.\n\nAnd we'll be doing a live stream this afternoon, 4 p.m. Eastern time. I'll be interviewing Laverne Cox and Jacqueline Woodson, as well as Ava DuVernay interviewing Stacey Abrams, also David Oyelowo and Eva Longoria will be speaking, in an afternoon of racial reconciliation. I'm Amy Goodman in Los Angeles, Juan González in New York.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "The Rediscovery of America: why Native history is American history\n\nHistorian Ned Blackhawk's new book stresses the importance of telling US history with a wider and more inclusive lens\n\nF our centuries after African captives arrived on the shore of Virginia, America's origin story was recast by the 1619 Project with slavery and the contribution of African Americans at his heart. It was a long-overdue corrective to white, Eurocentric narratives. But it was the not the last word.\n\n\"Scholars have recently come to view African American slavery as central to the making of America, but few have seen Native Americans in a similar light,\" writes Ned Blackhawk , a historian at Yale University and member of the Te-Moak Tribe of Western Shoshone. \"Binary, rather than multiracial, visions dominate studies of the past where slavery represents America's original sin or the antithesis of the American idea.\n\n\"But can we imagine an American Eden that is not cultivated by its original caretakers? Exiled from the American origin story, Indigenous peoples await the telling of a continental history that includes them. It was their garden homelands, after all, that birthed America.\"\n\nIn his new book, The Rediscovery of America: Native Peoples and the Unmaking of US History , Blackhawk attempts to tell that continental history over five centuries, from Spanish colonial exploration to the rise of Indian self-determination. Native Americans played a foundational role in shaping America's constitutional democracy, he contends, even as they were murdered and dispossessed of their land.\n\nTaken with Nikole Hannah-Jones's 1619 Project, it is a reminder of the danger of a single story when history is better understood as a multiverse of perspectives.\n\nJournalist Jonathan Capehart, interviewing Blackhawk for a recent Washington Post Live event , observed: \"I'm old enough to remember the encyclopaedias or biology books where you've got the main page and then you have these plastic overlays - you lay one down and you see one set of organs; you lay another one down, you see more, but you see them altogether. And in looking at The Rediscovery of America and having looked at 1619 Project, that's what it felt like to me.\"\n\nBlackhawk, 51, who has been teaching Native American history since 1999, makes the case for a paradigm of \"encounter\" rather than \"discovery\" in which Europeans and their settler communities are not the exclusive subjects of inquiry. He points to a generation of scholars who have shown that \"American Indians were central to every century of US historical development\", particularly during the era of the American revolution.\n\nA turning point was the fallout from the Seven Years' War between Britain and France, which started as a dispute over North American land claims in the region around Pittsburgh and ended in 1763 with France ceding Canada to Britain.\n\nSpeaking from a book-lined home office in New Haven, Connecticut, Blackhawk says: \"What happens in the summer of 1763? A bunch of Indians are not happy that the French have been expelled and that the new British overlords of the interior portions of North America are imposing unilateral authoritarian regimes essentially.\"\n\nLed by Pontiac, an Odawa (Ottawa) chief, Native Americans took up arms against the British in what became known as Pontiac's Rebellion . A conflict erupted that would enflame tensions between the British crown and its own subjects and seed the fall of the British empire in North America.\n\nBlackhawk explains: \"The settlers have moved into the interior following the Seven Years' War and started building small farms and orchards and raising cattle and pigs. Throughout the late 1750s and early 1760s they're primed to gain more interior land. Native Americans are resisting this and the British crown decides that another war is too costly in the interior and so they pass a royal proclamation of 1763 to keep their settlers from moving into the interior.\n\n\"The settlers defy British authority. One of the ways they do that is by killing Indians whom they believe are fuelling trade to Pontiac's allies in places like Detroit and across a road between Philadelphia, which is a seaport, and Pittsburgh, which has recently been settled and renamed after the future British prime minister William Pitt.\n\n\"Along this 300-mile road known as Forbes Road , militia groups essentially start marauding not just Indian communities that they fear are trading with Pontiac but British supply trains because the British are trying to make peace with Pontiac. These are not robbers. They're rebels. They are insurgents who have a kind of political psychology aimed at dislodging allegiances with interior Indians.\"\n\nThe author adds: \"That's where the revolution has some of its most formative fuel. The idea of a frontier being attacked by 'merciless Indian savages' is written into the United States declaration of independence. Where does that idea come from? US historians have been unable sufficiently to explain the origins and genealogy of that language, that ideology, and essentially that history which will pervade the early republic.\n\n\"It's not coincidental that there are no federally recognised tribes in the states of Ohio and Pennsylvania where these conflicts are most pronounced.\"\n\nThe perceived threat from Native Americans was crucial, Blackhawk asserts, to the formation of a central government able to extend its authority over national concerns. A federal constitution was drawn up to unite the 13 states and manage their territorial expansion.\n\n\"Indian affairs are one of the few areas in which the drafters of the constitution have general agreement that a federalist system, a centralised, more powerful political structure, is needed to manage the new republic's relationships with Native Americans. The articles of confederation failed to do that.\n\n\"One of those new authorities is to make treaties the supreme law of the land as they're not in the constitution. The federal government signs treaties with Native Americans right away and continues a practice that dates back to the late British period of bilateral relationships with recognised Indigenous nations. Those are the first treaties the US Senate ratifies.\"\n\nBlackhawk himself was able to go to college in Canada as a consequence of the 1794 Jay Treaty, which provided that Native Americans may travel freely across the international boundary. \"These histories aren't confined to the past. They have ongoing legacies, realities and meanings that we as historians of the United States have been remiss to identify.\"\n\nBlackhawk also analyses the neglected role of Native Americans in the 1861-65 civil war. In Oklahoma the Confederacy essentially forced them to renounce their loyalty to the Union, sign treaties as allies and form battalions that fought for the south. In California the federal government was unable to meet its treaty obligations, prompting Native Americans to take up arms; this brought them into conflict with white settlers who, funded by the government, killed thousands of Indigenous people.\n\n\"There is this incredible under-told story of the civil war in Indian country involving the Confederacy. You really can't understand the ultimate legacies of the civil war outside of an understanding of not just the Native conflicts that happened during the war but the growing power of the federal government thereafter.\"\n\nThis was on the watch of President Abraham Lincoln, whose speeches are endlessly quoted, whose monument sits on the National Mall in Washington and whose legacy is still revered. Blackhawk reflects: \"It's hard not to see him in the ways we currently do but he is president of the United States at a time when its armies, military leaders and politicians are instituting policies and practices that are extraordinarily harmful against Native Americans.\n\n\"Some call these genocide - either stateless genocide in California or even state-driven initiatives in places like Sand Creek, Colorado, the Dakota war in Minnesota, the Bear River Massacre of the Idaho-Utah frontier, and indiscriminate killings of innocent women, children and the elderly that are famous within the study of Indian massacres and warfare. Lincoln was aware of this; had no space, time or energy to potentially remedy it, and just simply would offer platitudes of guidance that had very limited actual traction to them.\"\n\nBlackhawk writes about the uncomfortable juxtaposition of Lincoln's efforts to end slavery in late 1862 and early 1863 - at the same time the territory of Minnesota was essentially ethnic cleansing the Dakota people along the Minnesota River. Thirty-eight Dakota men were hanged in Mankato, Minnesota, in the wake of a six-week uprising of Dakota people against white settlers after the government broke its promise to deliver food and supplies in exchange for the surrender of tribal land. It was the biggest mass execution in American history.\n\nBut this is also a story of fortitude, resilience and creativity.

      "text": "The Rediscovery of America: why Native history is American history\n\nHistorian Ned Blackhawk's new book stresses the importance of telling US history with a wider and more inclusive lens\n\nF our centuries after African captives arrived on the shore of Virginia, America's origin story was recast by the 1619 Project with slavery and the contribution of African Americans at his heart. It was a long-overdue corrective to white, Eurocentric narratives. But it was the not the last word.\n\n\"Scholars have recently come to view African American slavery as central to the making of America, but few have seen Native Americans in a similar light,\" writes Ned Blackhawk , a historian at Yale University and member of the Te-Moak Tribe of Western Shoshone. \"Binary, rather than multiracial, visions dominate studies of the past where slavery represents America's original sin or the antithesis of the American idea.\n\n\"But can we imagine an American Eden that is not cultivated by its original caretakers? Exiled from the American origin story, Indigenous peoples await the telling of a continental history that includes them. It was their garden homelands, after all, that birthed America.\"\n\nIn his new book, The Rediscovery of America: Native Peoples and the Unmaking of US History , Blackhawk attempts to tell that continental history over five centuries, from Spanish colonial exploration to the rise of Indian self-determination. Native Americans played a foundational role in shaping America's constitutional democracy, he contends, even as they were murdered and dispossessed of their land.\n\nTaken with Nikole Hannah-Jones's 1619 Project, it is a reminder of the danger of a single story when history is better understood as a multiverse of perspectives.\n\nJournalist Jonathan Capehart, interviewing Blackhawk for a recent Washington Post Live event , observed: \"I'm old enough to remember the encyclopaedias or biology books where you've got the main page and then you have these plastic overlays - you lay one down and you see one set of organs; you lay another one down, you see more, but you see them altogether. And in looking at The Rediscovery of America and having looked at 1619 Project, that's what it felt like to me.\"\n\nBlackhawk, 51, who has been teaching Native American history since 1999, makes the case for a paradigm of \"encounter\" rather than \"discovery\" in which Europeans and their settler communities are not the exclusive subjects of inquiry. He points to a generation of scholars who have shown that \"American Indians were central to every century of US historical development\", particularly during the era of the American revolution.\n\nA turning point was the fallout from the Seven Years' War between Britain and France, which started as a dispute over North American land claims in the region around Pittsburgh and ended in 1763 with France ceding Canada to Britain.\n\nSpeaking from a book-lined home office in New Haven, Connecticut, Blackhawk says: \"What happens in the summer of 1763? A bunch of Indians are not happy that the French have been expelled and that the new British overlords of the interior portions of North America are imposing unilateral authoritarian regimes essentially.\"\n\nLed by Pontiac, an Odawa (Ottawa) chief, Native Americans took up arms against the British in what became known as Pontiac's Rebellion . A conflict erupted that would enflame tensions between the British crown and its own subjects and seed the fall of the British empire in North America.\n\nBlackhawk explains: \"The settlers have moved into the interior following the Seven Years' War and started building small farms and orchards and raising cattle and pigs. Throughout the late 1750s and early 1760s they're primed to gain more interior land. Native Americans are resisting this and the British crown decides that another war is too costly in the interior and so they pass a royal proclamation of 1763 to keep their settlers from moving into the interior.\n\n\"The settlers defy British authority. One of the ways they do that is by killing Indians whom they believe are fuelling trade to Pontiac's allies in places like Detroit and across a road between Philadelphia, which is a seaport, and Pittsburgh, which has recently been settled and renamed after the future British prime minister William Pitt.\n\n\"Along this 300-mile road known as Forbes Road , militia groups essentially start marauding not just Indian communities that they fear are trading with Pontiac but British supply trains because the British are trying to make peace with Pontiac. These are not robbers. They're rebels. They are insurgents who have a kind of political psychology aimed at dislodging allegiances with interior Indians.\"\n\nThe author adds: \"That's where the revolution has some of its most formative fuel. The idea of a frontier being attacked by 'merciless Indian savages' is written into the United States declaration of independence. Where does that idea come from? US historians have been unable sufficiently to explain the origins and genealogy of that language, that ideology, and essentially that history which will pervade the early republic.\n\n\"It's not coincidental that there are no federally recognised tribes in the states of Ohio and Pennsylvania where these conflicts are most pronounced.\"\n\nThe perceived threat from Native Americans was crucial, Blackhawk asserts, to the formation of a central government able to extend its authority over national concerns. A federal constitution was drawn up to unite the 13 states and manage their territorial expansion.\n\n\"Indian affairs are one of the few areas in which the drafters of the constitution have general agreement that a federalist system, a centralised, more powerful political structure, is needed to manage the new republic's relationships with Native Americans. The articles of confederation failed to do that.\n\n\"One of those new authorities is to make treaties the supreme law of the land as they're not in the constitution. The federal government signs treaties with Native Americans right away and continues a practice that dates back to the late British period of bilateral relationships with recognised Indigenous nations. Those are the first treaties the US Senate ratifies.\"\n\nBlackhawk himself was able to go to college in Canada as a consequence of the 1794 Jay Treaty, which provided that Native Americans may travel freely across the international boundary. \"These histories aren't confined to the past. They have ongoing legacies, realities and meanings that we as historians of the United States have been remiss to identify.\"\n\nBlackhawk also analyses the neglected role of Native Americans in the 1861-65 civil war. In Oklahoma the Confederacy essentially forced them to renounce their loyalty to the Union, sign treaties as allies and form battalions that fought for the south. In California the federal government was unable to meet its treaty obligations, prompting Native Americans to take up arms; this brought them into conflict with white settlers who, funded by the government, killed thousands of Indigenous people.\n\n\"There is this incredible under-told story of the civil war in Indian country involving the Confederacy. You really can't understand the ultimate legacies of the civil war outside of an understanding of not just the Native conflicts that happened during the war but the growing power of the federal government thereafter.\"\n\nThis was on the watch of President Abraham Lincoln, whose speeches are endlessly quoted, whose monument sits on the National Mall in Washington and whose legacy is still revered. Blackhawk reflects: \"It's hard not to see him in the ways we currently do but he is president of the United States at a time when its armies, military leaders and politicians are instituting policies and practices that are extraordinarily harmful against Native Americans.\n\n\"Some call these genocide - either stateless genocide in California or even state-driven initiatives in places like Sand Creek, Colorado, the Dakota war in Minnesota, the Bear River Massacre of the Idaho-Utah frontier, and indiscriminate killings of innocent women, children and the elderly that are famous within the study of Indian massacres and warfare. Lincoln was aware of this; had no space, time or energy to potentially remedy it, and just simply would offer platitudes of guidance that had very limited actual traction to them.\"\n\nBlackhawk writes about the uncomfortable juxtaposition of Lincoln's efforts to end slavery in late 1862 and early 1863 - at the same time the territory of Minnesota was essentially ethnic cleansing the Dakota people along the Minnesota River. Thirty-eight Dakota men were hanged in Mankato, Minnesota, in the wake of a six-week uprising of Dakota people against white settlers after the government broke its promise to deliver food and supplies in exchange for the surrender of tribal land. It was the biggest mass execution in American history.\n\nBut this is also a story of fortitude, resilience and creativity. Chapter 12 of the book is called \"From Termination to Self-Determination\". It tells how, in the 20th century, there was another attempt to assimilate Native Americans into the body politic and \"terminate\" tribal governments. But an ideology known as Red Power formed in the 1960s and 1970s, improving autonomy and infrastructure on reservations.\n\n\"We are living still in an era known as self-determination that has seen dramatically resurgent expressions of Native American politics, economic development, interesting social and cultural movements.\"\n\nBlackhawk cites the Smithsonian National Museum of the American Indian on the National Mall, the passage of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and Joe Biden's appointment of Deb Haaland as interior secretary, making her the first Native American to serve as a cabinet secretary.\n\n\"This has happened in recent years and it's not coming out of a vacuum. To understand the contemporary moment requires this kind of historical understanding, Most urgently, to understand the threats that are being marshalled against Native American sovereignty also requires this kind of historical perspective.\n\n\"Questions about race and distinctiveness and sovereignty are daily questions in the practice of federal Indian law. If we can't educate our citizens and our children and our judges and political leaders on these issues, we will likely face threats that we can't yet fully identify.\"\n\nThe Rediscovery of America is out now"

      "text": "New England once hunted and killed humans for money. We're descendants of the survivors\n\nThe settlers whom many Americans mythologize at Thanksgiving as peace-loving Pilgrims issued government orders offering cash for dead Native American children\n\nF or more than 10,000 years, the Wabanaki peoples have been living in a region called the Dawnland. Captain John Smith rebranded the area \"New England\" in a map he made in 1614. He and the other colonial settlers renamed rivers and villages to claim the land for themselves and erase Native people from their homelands. But that wasn't enough. Eventually colonial officials introduced a grisly incentive to hasten that erasure: bounties for dead Native Americans .\n\nYes, the settlers whom many Americans mythologize at Thanksgiving as peace-loving pilgrims were, just a generation later, issuing official government orders putting a price on the scalps of Indigenous children, women and men.\n\nThe reward: about $12,000 in today's dollars for the scalp of a man, half that for a woman, and a bit less for a child. It was nearly as much as a soldier would earn in two years. Sometimes bounty hunters were granted the land of the people they scalped - thousands of acres, which scalpers used to found towns that they named after themselves, like Westbrook, Maine; Shirley, Massachusetts; and Spencer, Massachusetts, to name just a few.\n\nAccording to our research, there were at least 69 government-issued scalp edicts across the Dawnland from 1675 to 1760, and at least 50 scalp edicts issued elsewhere in the United States until 1885. The proclamations targeted specific tribes by name - and occasionally marked specific tribes safe because they were \"allies\" of the authorities. But neither scalpers nor authorities had much way of knowing the tribal affiliations of the people whose scalps they took, so for centuries bounties were a license to kill all Indigenous people.\n\nWe are part of the team behind the new short documentary Bounty . In New England alone, we've uncovered government payments for 375 human scalps, submitted in 94 separate claims and equaling government payments of millions of dollars in today's money. More documents may be buried in colonial archives.\n\nIn 1755, the lieutenant governor of the province of Massachusetts Bay, Spencer Phips, issued an edict declaring the Penobscot people a target of extermination and commanding \"his Majesty's Subjects of this Province to Embrace all opportunities of pursuing, captivating, killing, and Destroying all and every of the aforesaid Indians\".\n\nThe Phips Proclamation lives on in collective memory because members of the Penobscot Nation and other Wabanaki peoples sometimes post it on the walls of tribal government offices as a kind of reminder: You tried to kill us, but we are still here. The United States was built on our lands and on top of the bones of our ancestors. We live and thrive on these lands today and are sovereign nations with the right to self-determination.\n\nIn our film, Penobscot parents and children read and react to one of the dozens of government-issued bounty proclamations that motivated colonial settlers to hunt, murder, and scalp Indigenous people.\n\nThe lives that were destroyed by scalping were tallied up in a ledger and the human remains incinerated to prevent double payment. But the digits in that ledger represented murdered mothers, fathers, two-spirits, daughters, sons, aunts, uncles, sisters, brothers, cousins and infants, usually rendered nameless in the historical record.\n\nOf course, those deadly bounties were only one of the tools deployed by the European settlers to make this land theirs. The legacy of those wrongs manifest today in a range of forms: the epidemic of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls; the fact that Indigenous people have the highest rate of death at the hands of police, the highest suicide rate among veterans, a disproportionate rate of death from Covid-19, and the highest incarceration rates in the US; continued violations of Indigenous sovereignty by state and federal authorities and private extractive industries; the continued use of Indian mascots; and the celebration of national holidays, like Thanksgiving and Columbus Day, that dishonor Native peoples.\n\nIn spite of countless wars, massacres, land ordinances, and extermination orders, today there are over 5 million Indigenous people in the United States who are citizens or members of more than 600 tribal nations. And while the legacy of anti-Native brutality remains, most Native people are thriving and modeling for all people in the US how to live in caring communities based on mutual respect, reciprocity, and reverence for the land, water, and all our relations.\n\nIn this season, as families and friends gather to share gratitude, let us seek new opportunities to learn about our collective history, in all its complexity, and embrace a future built upon mutual understanding and respect for our neighbors.\n\nMaulian Dana is the Penobscot national tribal ambassador.

      "text": "Surprise as DNA reveals new group of Native Americans: the ancient Beringians\n\nGenetic analysis of a baby girl who died at the end of the last ice age shows she belonged to a previously unknown ancient group of Native Americans\n\nA baby girl who lived and died in what is now Alaska at the end of the last ice age belonged to a previously unknown group of ancient Native Americans , according to DNA recovered from her bones.\n\nThe child, a mere six weeks old when she died, was found in a burial pit next to the remains of a stillborn baby, perhaps a first cousin, during excavations of an 11,500-year-old residential camp in Tanana River Valley in Central Alaska. The remains were discovered in 2013, but a full genetic analysis has not been possible until now.\n\nResearchers tried to recover ancient DNA from both of the infants but succeeded only in the case of the larger individual. They had expected her genetic material to resemble modern northern or southern lineages of Native Americans, but found instead that she had a distinct genetic makeup that made her a member of a separate population.\n\nThe newly-discovered group, named \"ancient Beringians\", appears to have split off from the founding population of Native Americans about 20,000 years ago. While the ancestors of other Native Americans pushed south into the continent as the ice caps thawed, the ancient Beringians remained in the north until they eventually died out.\n\n\"This is a new population of Native Americans,\" said Eske Willerslev, an evolutionary geneticist at the University of Copenhagen, whose team recovered the girl's DNA from a dense part of her skull known as the petrous bone. Details of the work are published in Nature .\n\nWorking with scientists at the University of Alaska and elsewhere, Willerslev compared the genetic makeup of the baby, named Xach'itee'aanenh t'eede gaay or \"sunrise child-girl\" by the local community, with genomes from other ancient and modern people. They found that nearly half of the girl's DNA came from the ancient north Eurasians who lived in what is now Siberia. The rest of her genetic makeup was a roughly even mix of DNA now carried by the northern and southern Native Americans.\n\nUsing evolutionary models, the researchers showed that the ancestors of the first Native Americans started to emerge as a distinct population about 35,000 years ago, probably in north-east Asia. About 25,000 years ago, this group mixed and bred with ancient north Eurasians in the region, the descendants of whom went on to become the first Native Americans to settle the New World.\n\nDuring the last ice age, so much water was locked up in the ice caps that a land bridge reached from Asia to North America across what is now the Bering Strait. Willerslev believes the ancestors of Native Americans travelled to the continent in a single wave of migration more than 20,000 years ago. Those who settled in the north became the isolated ancient Beringians, he said, while those who moved south, around or through the ice sheets, split into the north and south Native Americans about 15,700 years ago.\n\nBut there is another possibility. Ben Potter, an archaeologist on the team from the University of Alaska in Fairbanks, suspects that the Beringians split from the ancestors of other Native Americans in Asia before both groups made their way across the land bridge to North America in separate migrations. \"The support for this scenario is pretty strong,\" he said. \"We have no evidence of people in the Beringia region 20,000 years ago.\"\n\nThe families who lived at the ancient camp may have spent months there, Potter said. Excavations at the site, known as Upward Sun River, have revealed at least three tent structures that would have provided shelter. The two babies were found in a burial pit beneath a hearth where families cooked salmon caught in the local river. The cremated remains of a third child , who died at the age of three, were found on top of the hearth at the abandoned camp.\n\nConnie Mulligan, an anthropologist at the University of Florida, said the findings pointed to a single migration of people from Asia to the New World, but said other questions remained. \"How did people move so quickly to the southernmost point of South America and settle two continents that span a huge climatic and geographic range?\" she said.\n\nDavid Reich, a geneticist at Harvard University, said the work boosted the case for a single migration into Alaska, but did not rule out alternatives involving multiple waves of migration. He added that he was unconvinced that the ancient Beringian group split from the ancestors of other Native Americans 20,000 years ago, because even tiny errors in scientists' data can lead to radically different split times for evolutionary lineages. \"While the 19,000-21,000 year date would have important implications if true and may very well be right, I am not convinced that there is compelling evidence that the initial split date is that old,\" he said."

      "text": "The battle for Mount Rushmore: 'It should be turned into something like the Holocaust Museum'\n\nThe national memorial draws nearly 3 million visitors a year - and Native Americans want the site back with a focus on oppression\n\nM ount Rushmore national memorial draws nearly 3 million visitors a year to its remote location in South Dakota . They travel from all corners of the globe just to lay their eyes on what the National Park Service calls America's \"shrine of democracy\".\n\nPhil Two Eagle is not opposed to the fact that the giant sculpture of American presidents is a major tourist attraction but he thinks the park should have a different focus: oppression.\n\n\"It should be turned into something like the United States Holocaust Museum,\" he said. \"The world needs to know what was done to us.\"\n\nTwo Eagle noted what historians have also documented . Hitler got some of his genocidal ideas for ethnic cleansing from 19th and early 20th century US policies against Native Americans.\n\nTwo Eagle is Sicangu Lakota and a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe in South Dakota. He directs the tribe's treaty council office which fights to claim sovereignty over lost homeland. He is part of a growing indigenous movement across the US and Canada that is demanding the return of Native American territory seized through broken treaties. And ground zero for the movement is Mount Rushmore.\n\nOpposition is already proving staunch. Yet while Native Americans have been fighting to get their lands back for centuries, indigenous activists say real progress finally seems possible now that Deb Haaland, a member of Laguna Pueblo, is secretary of the interior. As the first Native American to hold a US cabinet position, Haaland oversees 450m acres of federal land - all of it indigenous territory and much of it stolen through broken treaties.\n\n\"Having Haaland heading up the Department of Interior is a game changer,\" said Krystal Two Bulls, who is Oglala Lakota and Northern Cheyenne and director of NDN Collective's Land Back campaign, an initiative demanding that governments honor their treaties with Indigenous people. \"It opens the door for beginning the healing process. Returning our land is the first step toward reparations.\"\n\nMount Rushmore is located in the Black Hills, a nearly 2m-acre expanse of fertile forests, creeks and rocky outcrops that is sacred to the Lakota. The Black Hills is the place they call \"the heart of everything that is\". After decades of fighting to keep European immigrants out of their homeland, the Lakota, Dakota and Nakota people reached a settlement with the US government and signed the Fort Laramie treaties of 1851 and 1868. The agreements established a sovereign 35m-acre \"permanent home\" for the Plains tribes called the Great Sioux Nation that occupied the entire western half of South Dakota, including the Black Hills.\n\nBut in 1874, Lt Col George Armstrong Custer led a survey party into the Black Hills without permission from the tribes and discovered rich gold deposits. Rather than abide by its treaties, which the US constitution calls the \"supreme law of the land\", the federal government allowed gold prospectors and settlers to overrun the Black Hills and surrounding area.\n\nMembers of the Great Sioux Nation were forced to surrender most of their territory and move to much smaller reservations on what was deemed useless land by the US government. Decades later, the busts of four US presidents - two slave owners and two who were hostile toward Native Americans - were chiseled into the holy mountain the Lakota called \"Tunkasila Sakpe\", the Six Grandfathers.\n\nBased in Rapid City next to the Pine Ridge reservation, the social media-savvy NDN Collective was energized by last summer's Black Lives Matter protests and resolved to launch a similar campaign promoting the return of indigenous lands. That effort suddenly accelerated when Donald Trump showed up at Mount Rushmore on 3 July last year for a fireworks-studded re-election rally.\n\nNDN Collective organized a protest that blocked the road to the park, claiming the rallygoers were trespassing on sovereign lands of the Great Sioux Nation. Indigenous activists wore eagle feathers, beat drums and faced off with a line of air national guard who were dressed in riot gear. No physical violence broke out but the assembly was deemed unlawful by the county sheriff and 20 activists were arrested. Videos of the protest went viral and so did the \"#landback\" hashtag along with NDN's demands for returning the Black Hills and closing Mount Rushmore, which the group described as \"an international symbol of white supremacy\".\n\nMeanwhile, inside the park, the former president told his cheering base what they wanted to hear. \"Our nation is witnessing a merciless campaign to wipe out our history, defame our heroes, erase our values and indoctrinate our children,\" he said, referring to the recent removal of Confederate monuments. The crowd chanted \"USA! USA!\" in response.\n\nElise Boxer, who is Dakota and a professor at the University of South Dakota where she directs the Native American Studies program, said the request for the return of homeland is largely misunderstood by non-indigenous people. \"It is not about owning the land. It is about regaining a spiritual relationship to the land,\" she said.\n\nThe memories of frontier settlers engaging in bloody battles with Native Americans are still raw in South Dakota, Boxer said. The Black Hills are the ultimate symbol of that racial tension. \"If our land is returned, there is the fear by non-indigenous people that they may be treated in the same way the early settlers treated us,\" she said. \"And there is also a very paternalistic belief held by the government that Natives can't take care of their own land.\"\n\nDeciding who has a rightful claim to the Black Hills is actually already settled according to a 1980 supreme court ruling in the case United States v Sioux Nation of Indians. \"A more ripe and rank case of dishonorable dealings will never, in all probability, be found in our history,\" stated the court's majority opinion that agreed the Black Hills had been stolen from the Sioux. The court's solution was to financially compensate the tribes for the land with an award of $2m. However, the tribes insisted the Black Hills were not for sale and they refused the payment. The award has been held in trust and now totals nearly $2bn with interest but the Lakota and other Sioux tribes, who live in some of the poorest areas in the United States, will not accept the money in exchange for their sacred lands.\n\n\"We are poor because our resources were stolen from us and those resources made others billions of dollars,\" said Red Dawn Foster, an Oglala Lakota and South Dakota state senator representing the Pine Ridge reservation. \"But our connection to the Black Hills is not a monetary one. Our main concern is that the land not be desecrated and we be allowed to resume our role as stewards of the land - that is our purpose as Lakota.\"\n\nFoster said many of the \"social ills\" experienced by the Lakota are rooted in the loss of their spiritual connection to the Black Hills and being denied access to sacred sites for ceremonies. She said the Sioux tribes are simply asking for a \"transfer of stewardship\", so the Black Hills would no longer be managed by the US Forest Service or Park Service but by the Great Sioux Nation.\n\nPutting Mount Rushmore, along with the rest of the Black Hills, under Native American management is a realistic first step for addressing the harms of colonization, she said.\n\nCorbin Johnson, until recently the mayor of the tourist-dependent town of Custer located in the middle of the Black Hills, is not thrilled about this idea. \"Why don't the people in other places give their land back?\" he said of non-indigenous supporters of NDN's campaign. (Johnson's term ended 30 June.) \"This whole country is on indigenous territory, so where does returning land start and where does it end?\"\n\nJohnson has lived in Custer county his entire life and finds the Black Hills \"magnetic\". His wife's family moved to Custer in 1875, the year after the United States broke the treaties and allowed European immigrants to establish homesteads. \"I understand the motivation for the land back thing but how do you make it work?\" Corbin asked. \"Figuring that out goes way beyond me or my town.\"\n\nWith a Democratic president and Congress in power as well as a Native American woman overseeing federal lands, Daniel Sheehan, chief counsel for the Lakota People's Law Project, is hopeful steps will be taken to finally address broken treaties.\n\nSince Haaland was sworn in in March, her department has transferred 18,800 federal acres comprising the National Bison Range in Montana to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, where the land will be held in trust for the Confederated Salish and Kootenai tribes. And Haaland has reportedly recommended to Joe Biden that the boundaries of Bears Ears National Monument be restored to their original size in order to protect numerous Native American cultural sites.\n\nSheehan said there are various legal mechanisms for returning control of Mount Rushmore and the rest of the Black Hills to the Sioux tribes such as passing a bill in Congress or executive action under the 1994 Indian Self-Determination Act. Mounting public pressure also plays a big role. A petition sponsored by NDN Collective requesting the closure of Mount Rushmore and return of public lands in the Black Hills currently has more than 44,000 signatures.\n\nMeanwhile, the staff at Mount Rushmore is attempting to carry out its mission of celebrating the \"shrine of democracy\" but also incorporate Native American culture as part of the visitor experience. \"We strive to provide a broad spectrum of history and messaging,\" said the Mount Rushmore chief of interpretation, Maureen McGee-Ballinger. She noted there is a \"Lakota, Nakota and Dakota Heritage Village\" interpretive display along the park's main trail. It is staffed by a fifth-generation grandson of the celebrated Oglala Sioux warrior Red Cloud. The current setup is a long way from what Phil Two Eagle envisions possible with a transformed monument that documents Native American genocide.\n\n\"After 500 years of injustice, you can't just put up a fake village manned by a token Indian and say, 'We're good,' \" said Two Eagle. \"We want to meet with Biden and ask him to honor the treaties. We want to find out what he will do to stop the ethnocide of our people.\"\n\nAfter the Fort Laramie treaties were abandoned in the wake of the Black Hills gold rush, the Lakota called the US government \"wasin icu\", which means \"takes all the fat\". Navajo author Mark Charles sees the current battle for the Black Hills as a chance for Anglo Americans to turn that paradigm on its head.\n\n\"The United States has historically viewed everything through the lens of exploitation and profit,\" he said. \"But indigenous people are trying to teach a very young nation a different way of being. We want white Americans to learn that life has so much more meaning if they can just see past the dollar sign.\""

A wet winter and spring rains had transformed the desert into a sea of color: green creosote bushes topped with small yellow flowers, white mariposa lilies, purple lupines and poppies in full bloom.\n\nCassadore and I drove up a rough dirt road that used to be an old cattle trail, passing through various ecosystems, moving from Sonoran desert to grasslands and piñon-juniper woodlands. In each area, Cassadore would stop to gather desert chia seeds, cacti flowers and thistles.\n\nCassadore stopped her truck beside a three-leafed sumac bush brimming with fruit. \"If you suck on them, they taste like sour lemonade,\" she said, removing the fuzzy, white unripened berries from the bush. Cassadore will make a slushy when they are ripe by blending the berries with wood sorrel and ice. \"Better for you than Kool-Aid,\" she said.\n\nAs a forager and celebrated food educator, Cassadore, 56, has spent the past 30 years documenting and teaching her fellow Western Apache people about the importance of wild foods in a region that's considered one of the most biodiverse in the US - yet where diet and substance abuse are leading causes of death . Working closely with the tribe's wellness center, the local high school and recovery groups, she often takes people out into the land to forage, cook and heal.\n\nF oraged food accounted for up to 50% of the Western Apache diet in pre-reservation times. In spring, it's onions, potatoes, miner's lettuce and thistles. In summer, it's cacti fruit, berries and acorns - \"the most prized food in our community\", Cassadore said. But after being forced on to reservations, the Apache were forbidden to gather their traditional foods and became dependent on rations and later, commodities. By the time Cassadore was growing up on the 1.8m-acre reservation, she said that many people looked down on foraged food, or associated it with poverty.\n\nSo she was often teased by her elementary school classmates for bringing homemade beef jerky, acorns, pine nuts and dried mesquite pods foraged by her and her family, instead of the candy bars and sodas that everyone else had. Today the White River, San Carlos and Fort Apache reservations are considered food deserts with few grocery stores and limited access to fresh, healthy foods.\n\n\"When you go to school with foraged food, you almost got bullied,\" she said. \"That was traumatizing for me, and I was embarrassed to bring food from my own home. To me, eating foraged food, this was normal. I didn't know Lucky Charms existed.\"\n\nCassadore later struggled with drug addiction and mental health issues for much of her life, but said that foraging provided her a way out. It allowed her to reconnect to her \"identity, culture and people\", she said. She spent years learning about traditional foodways, gaining the trust of community elders, listening to their stories, and harvesting the foods of her ancestors.\n\nThis gave her purpose and \"filled this void I had felt most of my life\", said Cassadore, who is now more than 20 years sober. \"Foraging healed me.\"\n\nThrough her work, Cassadore now helps others struggling with addiction, depression and other mental health issues. \"They come back with a connection of who they are, as an Apache person,\" said Cassadore, recalling leading a traditional gloscho (desert woodrat) hunt with patients from a drug and alcohol rehabilitation center. \"It wakes up something inside of people. It calms them and makes them want to get better.\"\n\nNaelyn Pike spent the summer after graduating high school working with Cassadore through the Traditional Western Apache Diet Project , a program to document and study traditional Ndee / Nnee (Western Apache) knowledge of the natural world and highlight the benefits of pre-reservation life and foods. Pike and other Apache youth spent days in the field with Cassadore, the organization's project assistant, learning about Apache foods, recipes and traditions.\n\n\"It left a huge mark on my life,\" said 23-year-old Pike, an Indigenous rights activist and executive assistant to the office of the chairman for the San Carlos Apache Tribe. \"It teaches us the importance of our way of life as Apache people.\"\n\nLike many of her peers, Pike has re-embraced foraging since her time with Cassadore, spending time each summer harvesting acorns, saguaro fruit and other wild foods.\n\n\"I am very confident that when we go back to Apache foods, it doesn't just benefit us physically, but mentally, emotionally and spiritually,\" she said. \"Taking part in this project has opened my eyes to understanding traditional values and how important our food is. We want to reclaim, preserve and grasp on to this way of life.\"\n\nTribal officials told the Guardian that people on the San Carlos Apache Reservation are facing interconnected epidemics of substance abuse, suicide and sexual violence - and the threat of ecological collapse. \"For traditional people, these are all completely related,\" said one tribal official who asked not to be named. \"There are all kinds of historical reasons for people not living a balanced way of life. People like Twila are working really hard to bring the community back into this balance.\"\n\nC assadore favors particular plants at specific locations and elevations. \"I can't remember where a restaurant is, but I can remember exactly where a plant is,\" she said. Her favorite patch of prickly pear is at the base of a cliff band below a series of Anasazi cave ruins. Cassadore will make fruit leather and a vibrant purple-colored prickly pear sugar - \"messy but delicious\".\n\nCassadore is often scouting for the future. The banana yucca fruit won't be ripe until October. However, the development of the flowers in spring will determine the plant's fruit production.\n\n\"A big patch like this is the best place to harvest,\" she said of a large concentration of blooming banana yuccas whose white flowers resemble squash blossoms. When roasted, the fruit is \"apple-sauce sweet\". She plans to return here in the fall to teach people from the community how to gather and prepare the fruit.\n\nAlong with foraging, Cassadore has interviewed more than 100 elders to help identify more than 200 wild edible plants and hundreds of traditional recipes, like acorn soup and agave pie with crust made from foraged seeds.\n\nShe pulled her black Toyota truck off the side of Route 70 toward a patch of volcanic soil blanketed in small white flowers. She grabbed a screwdriver from the center console and started to dig wild vegetables from the rocky ground. \"Onions,\" she said. \"Collect and be grateful. Only take what you need.\" She plans to eat them with dinner, along with elk and wild roasted potatoes foraged weeks earlier.\n\n\"If you really want to start healing, work with the earth and ingredients that were given to us,\" she said."

      "text": "'We are still here': Native Americans fight to be counted in US census\n\nThe decennial count 'impacts everything' from federal funding to political representation for the tribes\n\nIt was the largest rollback of federal lands protections in US history.\n\nWhen President Donald Trump signed a 2017 executive order that reduced the size of Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments by nearly 2m acres, he said the move was supported in the state of Utah and by the local county where the monuments were located.\n\nOn the ground, however, that opposition didn't add up.\n\nSan Juan county, Utah, is majority Native American and includes parts of the Navajo Nation's and Ute Mountain Ute Tribe's reservations - both tribes officially support the protection of Bears Ears. Through gerrymandering, the majority Native county maintained a majority white county commission, where Native views were outnumbered - until last year.\n\nThe Navajo Nation brought a lawsuit against San Juan accusing the county of racial gerrymandering under the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The tribe won . The county was forced to redraw its election maps and in the fall of 2018, for the first time ever, elected a majority Native commission. The county commission now, officially, supports the protection of Bears Ears.\n\nToday, the Navajo Nation is still fighting for political representation, but with a different tool: the US census, which will take place this year . Without census data that proved the county's election maps reduced the voting power of Native residents, the tribe would not have been able to win its suit. Today, census data also determines tribal citizens' representation in Congress, state and county elections, and even the Nation's own tribal council.\n\nAccording to the US constitution, all residents living in the United States are to be counted every 10 years. The final census count determines seats in Congress, election maps for local and state representatives and the allocation of over $900bn in annual federal spending for the next decade, including $5.6bn for tribal programs . But despite the sprawling impact of the US census, Native Americans have historically been undercounted.\n\n\"It impacts everything,\" Charlaine Tso told the Guardian by phone. Tso represents District 9 on the Navajo Nation's tribal council, the section of the reservation in San Juan county. \"[The census] is a domino effect. It impacts education, roads and maintenance, elder care - funding for everything on our reservation.\"\n\nIn her role as tribal councilor, Tso serves on the Navajo Nation's Complete Count Commission for the 2020 census. Despite being one of the largest tribes in the US, Navajos, Tso says the committee believes, were significantly undercounted in the 2010 census, which ended up lowering federal funding levels for the tribe. \"We know for sure that it was nowhere near accurate. That margin, imagine what difference it makes in federal funding.\"\n\nThis problem is not unique to the Navajo Nation. An estimated one in seven Native Americans living on tribal lands were not counted in the last US census, according to the bureau's own audit . Making Native Americans - at 2% of the US population - the group most likely to be missed.\n\nAn estimated one in three Native people live in what the Census Bureau considers \"hard-to-count\" rural census tracts, representing 80% of all tribal lands. In many states with high Native populations - including New Mexico, Arizona, Alaska and South Dakota - over half of Native residents live in such \"hard-to-count\" areas.\n\nOther factors also disproportionately affect Native Americans, including poverty, housing insecurity, education and even age ( 42% of Native Americans are under the age of 24).\n\nDesi Rodrigues-Lonebear, a member of the Northern Cheyenne tribe and a demographer who served on the Census Bureau's national advisory committee from 2013 to 2019, says another big factor is mistrust.\n\n\"It's a hard sale,\" she told the Guardian. \"You're trying to convince people, your own relatives even, who for their whole lives wanted nothing else but to be left alone by the feds. And you're coming to them and saying but we really need you to fill out this form. We really need you to count.\"\n\nMany tribal leaders and advocates are worried the undercount could be even worse in 2020. For the first time ever, the census will be conducted mostly online. The move presents a unique challenge in Indian Country, where over a third of Native Americans living on tribal land lack access to broadband , making it the least connected part of the United States.\n\n\"It [the census] moving online almost ensures an undercount of Native Americans of historic proportions,\" Natalie Landreth, a Chickasaw Nation member and an attorney for the Native American Rights Foundation (Narf), told the Guardian.\n\nRaising further alarm bells for Landreth, the Census Bureau canceled two field tests planned for Indian Country that would have been used to identify problems with messaging and on-the-ground rollout.\n\nFunding for translation into Native languages also narrowed this year. In the past, the bureau has funded translation services into multiple Indigenous languages, but this year is only funding Navajo, according to Narf. \"There are census tracts in Alaska where 75% of the households don't speak English at home,\" says Landreth.\n\nNarf has connected tribes in seven states to private dollars for language translation services, but Landreth worries it's not enough. \"We have to do gap filling, which is a risky measure,\" she said. \"We're only going to be able to plug the dam in certain locations.\"\n\nAccording to Jessica Imotichey, a Chickasaw Nation member and a coordinator for the LA region of the US Census Bureau, the agency is working to ensure Native Americans are counted in 2020. \"[The census] is about representation, not just politically but also visibility,\" Imotichey said. \"Recognizing Native Americans and Alaskan Natives, that we are still here, that we still remain.\"\n\nIn remote Alaska, the census will start three months early in January, where workers will travel to Alaskan Native villages to count residents in person. Although only 0.02% of the US population will be counted through this \"in person numeration\", the majority of them will be Indigenous.\n\nStill, nationally, funding for census outreach campaigns varies significantly by location. While some states like California are planning to spend $187m on census outreach , 24 states have budgeted nothing . Three of those states - Oklahoma , North Dakota and South Dakota - have significant Native populations.\n\nNew Mexico, along with Alaska, was the most undercounted state in 2010 , with some counties returning less than 50% of census surveys. According to NM Counts 2020, just a 1% undercount in 2020 could result in the loss of $750m in federal aid to the state. In response, the state has budgeted $3.5m for outreach efforts.\n\nTso sits on a Complete Count Commission for the Navajo Nation - an area larger than West Virginia. The commission, one of the many regional committees working within New Mexico, has already met with US senators and regional Census Bureau representatives to discuss the unique challenges of counting their citizens. The tribal government is looking to hire a sizable outreach team this spring, with an emphasis on hiring fluent Navajo speakers, according to Tso.\n\n\"We have to do everything possible to count every Navajo,\" she says."

      "text": "13 Issues Facing Native People Beyond Mascots And Casinos\n\nFreelance writer and policy analyst\n\nMost of the recent headlines about indigenous Americans have had to do with a certain D.C. football team , or a surpassingly dumb Adam Sandler movie , or casinos of the kind operated by the fictional Ugaya tribe on \"House of Cards.\" And we're not saying these issues don't matter. But beyond the slot machines, the movie sets and the football fields, there are other problems facing Native communities -- insidious, systemic, life-or-death problems; the kinds of problems it takes years and votes and marches to resolve -- that aren't getting nearly as much attention.\n\nThere are 567 tribes , including 229 Alaska Native communities , currently recognized by the federal government. The Bureau of Indian Affairs -- the primary federal agency in charge of relations with indigenous communities -- is also considering extending federal status to Native Hawaiians .\n\nEach of the federally recognized tribes is a nation unto itself -- sovereign, self-determining and self-governing -- that maintains a government-to-government relationship with the United States. In addition, the rights of all indigenous peoples, including Native Hawaiians, have been affirmed in a 2007 United Nations declaration . Each indigenous nation has a distinct history, language and culture. While many face concerns that are specific to their government, state, or region, there are certain issues that affect all Native communities throughout the United States -- from Hawaii to Maine, and Alaska to Florida. Here are 13 such issues that you probably aren't hearing enough about.\n\nThanks in large part to the Black Lives Matter movement, which has insisted that demands for justice and equality for the black community remain part of the national conversation, there is now growing momentum to address the issues of policing and mass incarceration. But while the brutalization of black Americans at the hands of police, and their maltreatment within the criminal justice system, have garnered national headlines, similar injustices against Native Americans have gone largely unreported.\n\nEarlier this month, Paul Castaway, a mentally ill Rosebud Sioux tribal citizen, was shot and killed by Denver police. His death led to protests in the Denver Native community, and has shed light on the shocking rate at which police kill Native Americans ― who account for less than 1 percent of the national population, but who make up nearly 2 percent of all police killings , according to data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .\n\nNative peoples are also disproportionately affected by mass incarceration. In states with significant Native populations, Native Americans are wildly overrepresented in the criminal justice system. In South Dakota, for example, Native Americans make up 9 percent of the total population, but 29 percent of the prison population . In Alaska, Native people account for 15 percent of the total population and 38 percent of the prison population . And Native Hawaiians are only 10 percent of the state's population, but 39 percent of the incarcerated population .\n\nThe issue of mass incarceration in Native communities is complicated by overlapping and unresolved conflicts between tribal, federal and state jurisdictions . If a crime is thought to have occurred on a Native reservation or within a Native community, it's not always clear which agency is going to be in charge of prosecution. That's determined by a complex set of factors, including the severity of the charges and the races of the victims and alleged perpetrators. The overlapping jurisdictions of federal and tribal sovereignty also mean that Indians who commit crimes on tribal lands can be punished twice for the same offense: once under federal jurisdiction and again in tribal court . Lastly, aside from cases of domestic violence , tribal courts are not allowed to try major crimes as defined under the Major Crimes Act. This means that suspects in most felony cases are prosecuted in federal courts, where sentencing tends to be more severe .\n\nIn February, building off the momentum of Black Lives Matter, the Lakota Peoples' Law Project released its \" Native Lives Matter \" report, which gives an overview of the inequities faced by Native Americans in the criminal justice system. The report, like the voices of Native peoples in general, has been largely ignored in the growing national conversation about policing and criminal justice reform.\n\nNative peoples suffer from high rates of poverty and unemployment. Seventeen percent of Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders and 27 percent of all self-identified Native Americans and Alaska Natives live in poverty, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.\n\nHowever, the national figure distorts the prevalence of poverty on Indian reservations and in Alaska Native communities, where 22 percent of Native people live. In 2012, three of the five poorest counties in the U.S. , and five of the top 10, encompassed Sioux reservations in North and South Dakota.\n\nLast year, President Barack Obama visited the Standing Rock Sioux on the border of North and South Dakota, where the poverty rate is 43.2 percent ― almost three times the national average . The unemployment rate on the Standing Rock Reservation was over 60 percent as of 2014.\n\nThe U.S. was built on land taken from Indian nations, and indigenous peoples across the country are still living with the reality of dispossession. Right now, members of the San Carlos Apache Nation in Arizona are fighting the sale of their sacred Oak Flat site to foreign mining conglomerates.\n\nThe Kanaka Maoli in Hawaii are fighting to protect their sacred mountain Mauna Kea from the construction of a 30-meter, $1.4 billion telescope. Many Hawaiians are now questioning the legality of the state's annexation , which took place after a group of business interests, most of them American, overthrew of the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1893.\n\nAnd in the heartland, the Great Sioux Nation has refused a $1.3 billion settlement as payment for the government's illegal seizure of their sacred Black Hills in South Dakota in 1877. The faces of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt are etched into the Black Hills at Mount Rushmore.\n\nThroughout the history of North American settlement, the territorial dispossession of indigenous peoples has gone hand in hand with natural resource exploitation. In the 1800s, Indian nations in the West clashed with miners pouring into their territories in search of gold.\n\nToday, from the Bakken formation in North Dakota to the Tar Sands in northeastern Alberta, Canada, Indian nations often stand on the front lines of opposition to hydraulic fracturing and pipelines that pump oil out of indigenous communities -- violating treaty rights, threatening the environment and contributing to climate change in the process.\n\nOther groups, however, such as the Ute Tribe in Utah and the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation in North Dakota, have tried to make the most out of the economic opportunities presented by oil and natural gas extraction. For the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation, the rush to cash in on oil has resulted in a mess of inadequate regulation and corruption -- including allegations of murder for hire .\n\nNative American communities -- and particularly Native women and children -- suffer from an epidemic of violence. Native women are 3.5 times more likely to be raped or sexually assaulted in their life than women of other races. Twenty-two percent of Native children suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder -- a rate of PTSD equal to that found among Iraq and Afghanistan veterans.\n\nOften, this violence comes from outside the community. The nonprofit Mending the Sacred Hoop, citing 1990s data from the CDC and the Department of Justice, reports that \"over 80% of violence experienced by Native Americans is committed by persons not of the same race,\" a rate \"substantially higher than for whites or blacks.\"\n\nHowever, some progress has been made. This year, despite staunch GOP opposition, tribes won the right to prosecute non-Native men who commit crimes of domestic violence or dating violence or who violate orders of protection against Native women on Indian reservations. Tribes have continued to push for control over justice systems on sovereign Indian land, in spite of resistance from state, local and federal lawmakers and law enforcement authorities.\n\nOnly 51 percent of Native Americans in the class of 2010 graduated high school. Native Hawaiians fare better, but still underperform compared to their peers -- as best we can tell from the limited data, anyway. In the mid-'00s, about 70 percent of Native Hawaiians attending Hawaiian public schools graduated in four years, as compared to 78 percent of students statewide.\n\nFor Native Americans, at least, these disparities are in large part the result of inadequate federal funding, to the point where some schools on Indian reservations are deteriorated and structurally dangerous .\n\nForty percent of Native Americans who live on reservations are in substandard housing. One-third of homes are overcrowded, and less than 16 percent have indoor plumbing. Housing on reservations is funded by the Department of Housing and Urban Development and administered and augmented by tribes, and has been historically underfunded , despite treaties and the trust responsibility of the federal government.\n\nNative Americans, Alaska Natives and Native Hawaiians face massive disparities in health as compared to the general population, suffering from high rates of diabetes, obesity, substance abuse and HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases.\n\nAlthough Native Americans and Alaska Natives are eligible to receive health care through Indian Health Services, nearly one in three are uninsured . Like many other federal agencies that serve Native people, IHS has historically been underfunded. Local IHS facilities often lack basic services like emergency contraception, in some cases forcing Native patients to travel hundreds of miles for treatment elsewhere.\n\nIndian nations do not own their reservation lands. Rather, the lands are held in trust by the federal government. This prevents Native Americans who live on reservations from leveraging their assets for loans, making it difficult for them to start businesses or promote economic growth in the area.\n\nCompounding this problem, 14.5 percent of Native Americans are unbanked , and therefore lack the basic financial resources needed for economic prosperity.\n\nNative Americans and Alaska Natives are often unable to vote because there are no polling places anywhere near them. Some communities, such as the Duck Valley Reservation in Nevada and the Goshute Reservation in Utah, are located more than 100 miles from the nearest polling place .\n\nThese problems are compounded by high rates of illiteracy in some rural Native communities , such as the Yup'ik in Alaska, who primarily speak and read their native language because public education was not available in their region until the 1980s.\n\nSuicide is the second most common cause of death for Native youth ages 15 to 24 -- two and a half times the national rate for that age group. In February, following a rash of suicides, the Oglala Lakota Nation in South Dakota declared a state of emergency .\n\nNative languages are struggling to survive in the United States, with 130 \"at risk,\" according to UNESCO, and another 74 \"critically endangered.\" While some communities, such as the Native Hawaiians, the Anishinaabe and the Navajo, have had success preserving and revitalizing their languages, Native communities face obstacles from the testing and curriculum requirements of No Child Left Behind . And educators who want to teach young people about Native languages and cultures have to contend with a general lack of funding and resources.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "When Native Americans Are Told To 'Go Back' To Where They Came From\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nLori Metoxen, 52, works as an administrator at Oneida Behavioral Health in Green Bay, Wisconsin, a treatment center for indigenous people suffering from addiction and mental illness. Metoxen says one beautiful summer day in 2017 she drove home from work with the windows down, the sunroof open, and her Oneida Nation license plate, available only to members of the tribe, proudly displayed on the back of her car. When she stopped at a traffic light in the part of western Green Bay that belongs to the Oneida Nation reservation, she noticed a car full of white, teenage girls in the lane beside hers.\n\n\"Go back to Mexico, you scumbag sack of shit!\" one of the girls yelled at Metoxen.\n\nStunned, Metoxen remembers saying something like, \"What is your problem?\" to which the girl, after a string of profanities, replied, \"You heard me, go back to Mexico!\"\n\n\"The angriness of their voices was shocking to me,\" Metoxen, a Native American who is not from Mexico, recounted to HuffPost. \"They really needed to make somebody feel bad. What was the fun in that?\"\n\nAfter a few seconds, the light turned green and the white girls, all laughing, turned left. Metoxen drove straight, and as so often happens after incidents like these, she suddenly realized what she should have said.\n\n\" You go back to where you came from! I belong here!\"\n\nMetoxen's story is one of 22 stories HuffPost has collected of people with Native American ancestry being told - absurdly - to \"go back\" to where they came from.\n\nNative Americans reported being told different variations of the phrase: \"Go back to your country,\" \"go back to Mexico,\" \"go home,\" \"get out of our country,\" and \"go back to the reservation.\"\n\nFor a white person - and it's almost always a white person - to say \"go back\" to a Native American, whose ancestors were here long before European settlers colonized this continent, betrays the real, white supremacist meaning of the phrase: We don't want you anywhere at all.\n\nThese 22 stories were culled from over 800 reports of hate incidents , occurring over the last four years in the U.S., in which assailants communicated some variation of \"go back\" to their victims. HuffPost, working with ProPublica's Documenting Hate project, collected these incidents in a database to examine the moral emergency of hate in the era of President Donald Trump.\n\nThe 22 incidents occurred in 15 states, from a post office in Alaska to a Walmart in Arizona, from a library in Washington to that traffic intersection in Wisconsin.\n\nFive of the perpetrators in these hate incidents invoked the president's name while targeting their victim; six yelled \"go back\" from cars before driving off; six yelled \"go back to Mexico\" at their victims, none of whom are from Mexico; and of the perpetrators whose race is known, all were white.\n\nOf those Native Americans who were told to \"go back\" where they came from, three were veterans of the U.S. military.\n\nSome of those interviewed by HuffPost for this article expressed fears that anti-indigenous bigotry is on the rise thanks to the election of President Trump in 2016 - a man with a long history of racism towards Native Americans.\n\nTrump, after all, keeps a portrait of Andrew Jackson in the Oval Office, the 19th century president best known for his policy of \"Indian Removal,\" an ethnic cleansing campaign that included the Trail of Tears, the forced death march of Native Americans from their homes in the Deep South to points west, like Oklahoma, where 57-year-old Jennie Wright lives.\n\n\"I look Indian,\" Wright, a high school English teacher, told HuffPost. Her father was white but her mother, she said, was an enrolled member of the Mississippi Choctaw tribe.\n\nA couple weeks after the 2016 election, Wright says she went to a Walmart in Bartlesville, a short drive from the Osage Reservation (where Native Americans in the early 20th century, newly wealthy from oil discovered on that land, were systematically robbed and murdered .)\n\nAs Wright crossed a crosswalk in the Walmart parking lot, she suddenly heard the sound of a revving engine. She looked around and saw a middle-aged white woman in a \"beat-up old car\" speeding towards her. Wright scurried towards the sidewalk.\n\nThe woman in the car stopped, leaned her head out of the window and yelled at Wright to \"go back\" to where she came from. \"What the hell are you talking about?\" Wright replied.\n\n\"Go back to Mexico!\" the woman screamed, before speeding off and yelling, \"Trump!\"\n\nWright says it was the first time anything like this has ever happened to her. \"It opened my eyes a little bit,\" she told HuffPost. \"I always thought everything was pretty much okay. Thought it died out.\"\n\n\"Then he came,\" she added, referring to the president. \"And he gave everyone free rein to say things.\"\n\nA survey conducted in 2017 by NPR, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and Harvard University found that nearly 40% of Native Americans said they had personally experienced offensive comments about their race or ethnicity. Over a third of those surveyed said they or a family member had experienced either violence, threats or harassment because they are Native American.\n\nCheryl Redhorse Bennett, an assistant professor at Arizona State University who studies hate crimes targeting indigenous people, says she's seen a \"surge\" in Native Americans being told to \"go back\" since 2015.\n\nAlthough she's seen her fair share of Native Americans being the victims of anti-Hispanic hate (being told to \"go back to Mexico\"), she says perpetrators most often tell Native Americans to \"go back to the reservation.\"\n\n\"Generally native people refer to towns that are adjacent to reservations as border towns,\" Bennet explained to HuffPost. \"Within these border towns, there's a long history of violence against native people, racism, and hate crimes.\"\n\nBennett said white border town residents often view reservations and treaty rights not for what they are - meager compensations for centuries of theft and genocide - but as \"privileges\" unfairly bestowed upon Native Americans.\n\n\"You tell native people to 'go home,'\" Bennett said, \"but then you want to develop their land, you want to abolish treaty rights. So it's never enough.\"\n\nRattler, legal name Michael Markus, is a 46-year-old Marine veteran who is the descendant of Chief Red Cloud, the Lakota leader who signed the 1868 Ft. Laramie Treaty.\n\nRattler was among thousands of Native activists in 2016 who set up camp on land that treaty protected: the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in North Dakota. This was Rattler's ancestral land, and he was going to protect its ancient burial sites and its water from the planned construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline . The pipeline, he and other activists argued, was a violation of that treaty.\n\nIt was also a violation of that treaty, they later claimed, for state law enforcement officials to invade the native activists' unarmed encampment on Oct. 27, 2016, using sound cannons, rubber bullets, pepper spray, and tanks to disperse the protesters. Rattler was among a handful of activists who allegedly set barricades of tires and wood on fire to slow the violent police raid.\n\nFor this, months later in February, just after Trump's inauguration, he was indicted on federal charges of civil disorder and of using a fire to commit a felony. He and other activists saw the indictment as political - an excuse to justify the police brutality visited upon the encampments.\n\nAs he awaited trial, Ratter's bail conditions stipulated he had to wear an ankle monitor and not leave the area in and around Bismarck, North Dakota - a border town.\n\nIt was during this period, he told journalist Natasha Lennard , author of the book \"Being Numerous: Essays on Non-Fascist Life,\" that local residents would often drive past Rattler and yell \"go home!\" as he smoked cigarettes on his porch.\n\nIt's a striking scene to imagine: a Native American Marine veteran wearing an ankle monitor, awaiting trial for protecting tribal land from the fossil fuel industry, being told to \"go home\" by white people driving by.\n\n\"It's funny, because I want to get out of here too,\" Rattler told Lennard at the time. \"But part of me wants to yell back, 'Go home? We were here first!'\"\n\nAs Rattler awaited trial, President Trump approved the final permit for the Dakota Access Pipeline, which over the next year spilled oil five times , just as native activists had warned it would.\n\nRattler, after accepting a non-cooperating plea deal, is now serving a three-year sentence in a federal prison in South Dakota.\n\nIn a statement released to the press after his sentencing, he said he was praying that native activists had \"the strength to keep up the fight.\" Standing Rock, he said, \"was a training ground.\"\n\nAnd despite what he and other activists thought about the federal government's motivations for prosecuting him, Rattler also stated he was praying for the judge who handled his case.\n\n\"We all live on this earth together,\" he said. \"They segregate us because we have a different color skin, but we're all red underneath.\""

      "text": "California Schools Now Required To Teach About Mistreatment Of Native Americans\n\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - For Johnny Hernandez Jr., vice chairman of the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians in Southern California, it was difficult as a kid growing up around San Bernardino to hear two different accounts of the histories of Indigenous peoples in the state.\n\nOne account came from his elders and was based on their lived experiences, and another came from his teachers at school and glossed over decades of mistreatment Native American people faced.\n\n\"You have your family, but then you have the people you're supposed to respect - teachers and the administration,\" he said. \"As a kid - I'll speak for myself - it is confusing to ... know who's telling the truth.\"\n\nNow a bill signed into law by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday requires public schools teaching elementary, middle or high school students about Spanish colonization and the California gold rush to include instruction on the mistreatment and contributions of Native Americans during during those periods. The state Department of Education must consult with tribes when it updates its history and social studies curriculum framework after Jan. 1, 2025, under the law.\n\n\"This is a critical step to right some of the educational wrongs,\" Hernandez said before the bill was signed.\n\nNewsom signed the measure Friday on California Native American Day, a holiday first designated in the 1990s to honor the culture and history of Indigenous peoples in the state. California is home to 109 federally recognized Indigenous tribes, the second-most in the nation behind Alaska.\n\n\"I'm proud of the progress California has made to reckon with the dark chapters of our past, and we're committed to continuing this important work to promote equity, inclusion and accountability for Native peoples,\" Newsom said in statement. \"As we celebrate the many tribal communities in California today, we recommit to working with tribal partners to better address their unique needs and strengthen California for all.\"\n\nNewsom, who issued a state apology in 2019 for the historical violence against and mistreatment of Native Americans, also signed another 10 measures Friday to further support tribal needs.\n\nDemocratic Assemblymember James C. Ramos, the first Native American state lawmaker in California who authored the curriculum bill, said it would build on legislation the state passed in 2022 encouraging school districts to work with tribes to incorporate their history into curricula.\n\n\"For far too long California's First People and their history have been ignored or misrepresented,\" he said in a statement last month. \"Classroom instruction about the Mission and Gold Rush periods fails to include the loss of life, enslavement, starvation, illness and violence inflicted upon California Native American people during those times. These historical omissions from the curriculum are misleading.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "This Indigenous Photographer Documented Native Americans' Unique Connection With Nature - And It's A Must-See\n\nHead of Visuals, HuffPost\n\nFreelance photographer and writer\n\nThe homeland ecologies that have sustained Indigenous communities for countless millennia are essential parts of their identities, cultures and well-being. Indigenous photographer Joe Whittle, an enrolled citizen of the Caddo Nation and descendant of the Delaware Nation, has been documenting Indigenous People connecting with and caring for their homelands for over 25 years. He believes the original stewards of the land are still its best stewards today.\n\nWhittle says every Indigenous community he's known still honors the \"Natural Laws\" of reciprocal and sustainable relationships with nature that have allowed their societies to thrive for thousands of years. He believes Indigenous leadership and land return can help reverse the degradation our planet's ecologies and climate have experienced. As America honors Native American Heritage Month and celebrates another Thanksgiving holiday, it's a good time to reflect on the connection Indigenous People have had with this land since time immemorial, and what the world can learn from that.\n\nThe following images depict some of Whittle's favorite moments from his time spent with Indigenous People maintaining their ancient relationships with their homelands."

Source - Montana State University Library.\n\nAs a filmmaker, I am drawn to images. My first love of film came from old black and white movies by world cinema auteurs like the jarring works of Bergman, Eisenstein, Bunuel, Lang, Dreyer, Ozu and other great masters I will stop name-dropping. For a while in college, it felt almost like cheating to watch a film made in color. As I grew older, I accepted color and now find it hard to stick to a monochrome diet. Life seems too resplendent for just one tone.\n\nWhile making Moses on the Mesa , a film about a German-Jewish immigrant who fell in love with a Native-American woman and became governor of her tribe of Acoma Pueblo in New Mexico in the late 1800s, I developed a passion for researching old photographs of indigenous people. They were black and white photos of a beautiful mystical people, and it felt inconceivable that anyone would want to exterminate them from this continent as a conscious policy stretching over hundreds of years. It just seemed so barbaric and inhumane. Delving deeper into the research, I started coming across colorized photos of these first Americans. In them the people started to come to life even more. Looking at them I see regular people but also royalty. They are in a way no different than historical portraits of European kings, queens and nobility. Except that not only do they show majestic regalia, but also strong, natural faces rather than the weak, powdered gazes of the often-interbred rulers from across the ocean that brought their demise.\n\nMany of the photographs I found were colored by hand, as color film was only the domain of experimentalists until 1930s (thanks, Kodachrome!) Painting on black and white prints was an art in and of itself, and many of the colorized photos exhibit true talent which preserved for us the truer likeness of the people many a hundred years ago thought were vanishing. Of course, Native Americans have not vanished despite the harrowing efforts of so many. They are growing stronger as a people, but a way of life they left behind is often only found in these photos.\n\nPlease enjoy this first collection of colorized photos. If you like them, you can find many more at our historical and photographic archive here on Facebook . We are working on turning our award-winning film Moses on the Mesa into a television series that's based on first-hand accounts of life in the Wild West with a strong focus on indigenous culture and history.

      "text": "Native American Voting Rights Are Under Attack In Republican-Run States\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nAfter turning out to vote in record numbers in 2020 despite the COVID-19 pandemic, Native Americans are now one of the biggest targets of Republican-backed voter suppression efforts in states where their votes mattered the most.\n\nRepublicans in states with significant Native populations like Arizona, Kansas, Montana and more have enacted new laws that limit voter access in ways that disproportionately impact Native voters. Imposing strict time limits on correcting a mail-in ballot, prohibiting third-party ballot collection, implementing strict voter identification requirements and making it harder to pay for election resources all negatively impact Native Americans in these states, largely due to specific circumstances on reservations where many of them live.\n\n\"The laws the state legislatures are passing are lethal to every Native American living in those states,\" said OJ Semans, the founder of the Native voting rights group Four Directions and an enrolled member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe in South Dakota. Such legislation, he said, \"is going to knock us back 10 years\" after \"what we've been working through for the last 18 to 20 years to get more and more Native Americans to participate in elections.\"\n\nThe current GOP-backed voter suppression push comes after Native voters emerged as the key voting bloc in states across the country in determining the outcome of elections for president, Senate and the House. The new wave of laws seeks to take advantage of the existing barriers Native voters face by making them even higher than before.\n\nNative Americans have historically faced significant obstacles to the vote. The U.S. government interpreted the 14th Amendment, passed after the Civil War to grant Black Americans full citizenship rights, to exclude Native peoples from citizenship. Native women were not granted the right to vote in 1920, because Native citizenship was not formally recognized until Congress passed the Indian Citizenship Act in 1924. Even then, voting rights still remained elusive in some areas.\n\nIt wasn't until 1962 when New Mexico's laws blocking Native voting fell. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 also provided important protections for Native voting rights.\n\nBut barriers remain. In 2020, the Native American Rights Fund commissioned a study of obstacles to the Native vote through a series of field hearings and interviews with Native Americans across the country. The report found that they \"continue to face a wide array of first generation barriers to voting - actual barriers to voting - that are in fact preventing them from exercising their rights to vote and stripping them of their political power.\"\n\nThese barriers stem from a host of problems, including lack of adequate translation, underfunded county election departments or even hostile local election officials, unconventional mailing addresses and mail processes, and perhaps most importantly, distance from government resources and high rates of poverty that make travel challenging.\n\nMany of the new voting laws are damaging to Native voters even if they don't, on the surface, seem to single them out.\n\n\"It's not just policies and laws that specifically target Native voters, of which there are plenty, but some laws and policies that seem neutral have an adverse effect on Native communities,\" said Jonathan Diaz, counsel for the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit involved in voting rights lawsuits on behalf of Native communities.\n\nIn Arizona, Republicans' push to impose new restrictions on the Native vote came after Native communities emerged as the critical voting bloc enabling major Democratic Party victories in the state in 2018 and 2020.\n\nSome Native reservations saw up to 13% increases in turnout in 2020. President Joe Biden 's margin of 11,851 in Apache County, which mostly covers land in the Navajo Nation and Fort Apache Indian Reservation, exceeded his statewide margin of 10,457.\n\nNarrow victories by Democratic Sens. Kyrsten Sinema, in 2018, and Mark Kelly, in 2020, were similarly aided by strong turnout and support in counties with large Native populations. In the House, Democratic Rep. Tom O'Halleran, who represents Arizona's 1st Congressional District, won Apache County by 12,495 votes, exceeding his district-wide margin of 11,760.\n\nSince then, Arizona has passed restrictive election laws that disproportionately hit Native voters.\n\nOne law (S.B. 1003) stipulates that voters who mail or drop off their ballots must correct any unsigned ballots by 7 p.m. on election night. This was a major curtailment of a 2019 settlement agreement between the Navajo Nation and Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, who was represented by Attorney General Mark Brnovich, a Republican, that had allowed corrections to unsigned ballots up to five days after Election Day.\n\nThe Republican-controlled state legislature refused to hear public comment on the law prior to its passage. Yet the Navajo Nation sent a letter opposing it , stating that \"none of the Arizona counties seats are located on the Navajo Nation, a Navajo voter may have to travel hundreds of miles to add their missing signature to a mail-in ballot.\"\n\n\"The laws the state legislatures are passing are lethal to every Native American living in those states.\"\n\nDue to high rates of poverty on reservations, unpaved roads and limited access to transportation associated with rural living, and historic underinvestment in election services for Native communities, S.B. 1003 imposes a disproportionate burden on Native voters.\n\nArizona Republicans have also made sure that Native election offices cannot obtain additional funds from private sources for their underfunded election offices.\n\nIn 2020, the Center for Tech and Civic Life, a nonprofit funded by companies like Google and Facebook and tech-linked funds, provided grants to state and local election departments to help pay for COVID-related expenses and expand voting opportunities. As a result, Coconino County, Arizona , among other counties with large Native populations, was able to expand early in-person voting in Navajo Nation and provide drive-through voting centers.\n\nBut Arizona joined seven other Republican-run states in banning local counties from receiving private grants to help fund election services.\n\nThe ban \"could impact the ability [for Native communities] to have early in-person voting or other improvements in the election system to provide just adequate access, because we don't have equal access,\" said Patty Ferguson Bonhee, director of the Indian Legal Clinic at Arizona State University Law School.\n\nWhat is happening in Arizona is also happening in Montana, at an even more accelerated pace. Montana Republicans won full control of the state government for the first time in almost 20 years in the 2020 elections. They immediately went about making it harder for Native Montanans to vote .\n\nMontana Republicans have passed legislation ending same-day voter registration, requiring voters registering the vote less than 30 days before an election to do so at the election administrators' office, banning paid third parties from collecting and returning mail-in ballots, and imposing new voter ID requirements.\n\nAll of these provisions raise the existing barriers to Native voting even higher.\n\nNative voters in Montana often rely on alternative or satellite polling locations on their reservations. Limiting the registration period and requiring them to travel up to hundreds of miles to an election administrator's office if they live on a reservation significantly hampers their ability to register to vote and cast a ballot.\n\nThe ban on third-party paid ballot collection also disproportionately impacts Native communities. The rural and often-isolated nature of some reservation locations causes slower mail delivery times, which are further delayed by the sometimes untraditional nature of mailing addresses in these areas. People often do not have a street address and instead use P.O. boxes at a central location, or many people on the reservation use the same general mailing address.\n\nBallot collection makes it much easier for more isolated voters, including those on reservations, to overcome these obstacles and get their ballots delivered on time. It's often get-out-the-vote groups that do this work, but they are now banned from collecting ballots.\n\nThe reason Republicans aim to restrict Native voters in Montana is the same as in Arizona. They have been the key voting bloc in all three of Sen. Jon Tester's (D-Mont.) election campaigns. For example, in Tester's first win in 2006, he won the Native vote by 3,481 votes, just a hair short of his total statewide 3,562-vote margin of victory.\n\n\"The Native vote in 2020 was a deciding factor in a lot of states and those states are the ones enacting these new laws,\" Semans said.\n\nAs Native communities fight back against these new efforts to suppress their votes, they have found themselves stripped of some long-standing protections.\n\nThe Supreme Court's July ruling in Brnovich v. DNC gutted Section 2 protections of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 by allowing states to enact voting laws that disproportionately impact a racial minority group in a negative manner so long as the impact is, according to the court's conservative majority, small enough.\n\n\"A policy that appears to work for 98% or more of voters to whom it applies ― minority and non-minority alike ― is unlikely to render a system unequally open,\" Justice Samuel Alito wrote.\n\nThis overrode the intent of the 1982 reauthorization of the VRA that required courts to look at the \"totality of the circumstances\" in voting rights cases to determine if racial minorities are provided \"less opportunity\" to vote than whites.\n\nThe case was explicitly about Native voting rights since the Democratic National Committee had challenged Arizona Republicans' restriction on third-party ballot collection similar to the new one enacted in Montana. Thanks to the court's Brnovich decision that upheld Arizona's ballot collection restriction, Montana Republicans' new provision has a greater chance of being upheld as it faces legal challenges from Native voting rights advocates.\n\nThe challenges to Native voting rights from Brnovich are broad. Restrictive voting laws will not violate the VRA so long as they do not impose limits that go beyond the \"usual burdens of voting.\" The \"usual burdens\" include having to travel a long distance to register to vote or cast or correct a ballot, one of the major obstacles to Native voting.\n\n\"[Reservations are] very rural and there are many remote communities,\" said Allie Young, an enrolled member of the Navajo Nation and founder of Protect the Sacred, a project of Harness, a Navajo voter mobilization group. \"Organizers would be able to help if they could go into those communities and take ballots down to the dropbox for them. Now that's impossible.\"\n\n\"This is one of the most lethal rulings against Indian country since they made determinations on our treaties,\" Semans said.\n\nThe ruling, in effect, severely limits, if not cuts off, any hope for legal success in overcoming the new onslaught of voter suppression bills targeting Native communities. That leaves federal legislative action as a sole remedy.\n\nCongress is currently considering two bills that would help overcome the new wave of voter suppression: the For The People Act, which, among many other things, set a national standard for voter access, and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would reinstate the sections of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that have been gutted by Supreme Court conservatives. Additionally, a Native American Voting Rights Act has been introduced in both chambers.\n\nBut Republicans in Congress, who seek to gain by suppressing Native votes, are universally opposed to the For The People Act, and only one of them, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), supports the John Lewis voting law. This means these bills can only become law if the Senate changes its filibuster rules that currently require 60 votes for any bill to be debated, let alone passed.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) promised that voting rights will be the top priority of the Senate when it returns from recess in September.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Happy Native American Heritage Month From the Army That Brought You the Trail of Tears\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nAfter 250 years of armed attacks, forced relocations, ethnic cleansing, and genocide of Native Americans, the U.S. military wants to celebrate.\n\nTo celebrate Native American Heritage Month, the Pentagon has gone all out with ceremonies across the United States, from an Air Force-sponsored intertribal powwow in Florida to a celebration of Native American aircraft nose art in Oregon.\n\nThe military has also been pumping out feel-good stories about Native American troops: one South Dakota National Guardsman from the Oglala Sioux tribe was allowed to grow out his hair, and an Air National Guardsmen from the District of Columbia who belongs to four different tribes reflected in his Lakota, Seneca, Navajo, and Comanche heritage.\n\nThe top official involved in the commemorations, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks , gave a speech calling this month \"a time to remember the achievements of indigenous peoples throughout our nation's history\" and proceeded to begin that history with a reference to the Navajo \"Code Talkers,\" who used their native language to create an unbreakable code for U.S. Marines during World War II.\n\nThere is, however, quite a bit of history that Hicks's historical timeline skips: roughly 170 years of armed attacks, forced relocations, ethnic cleansing, and even genocide of Native Americans carried out by the U.S. military.\n\nOriginal reporting.

And there are a lot of proud Native veterans. But it's one of those gestures that is nice in theory but is, perhaps, meant to whitewash how we understand Native American history and how Native Americans ended up in the place that we did,\" said Keith Richotte Jr., the director of the Indigenous Peoples Law and Policy Program at the University of Arizona. \"It doesn't really address the fact that there was this longer history in which military violence was critical to the subjugation of Native peoples and maintaining the colonial project. It ignores the military's efforts in the late 18th and 19th centuries to essentially destroy tribes, tribal nations, and tribalism.\"\n\nAnother expert on the topic put it more bluntly.\n\n\"The Army was, bottom line, an instrument of a settler colonial empire that was determined to convert Native lands into private property for mostly white settlers,\" said Jeffrey Ostler, professor of history emeritus at the University of Oregon and author of \"Surviving Genocide: Native Nations and the United States From the American Revolution to Bleeding Kansas.\" \"That was its mission: to carry out a federal government policy that, in practice, often became a genocidal war.\"\n\nThe U.S. Army, formed in 1775, fought alongside and against Native Americans from its very founding.\n\nA piece published on the Pentagon's website earlier this month paid homage to that early collaboration, citing \" the legacy of the Oneida Nation , whose support for American independence saw the Continental Army through its lowest point in the Revolutionary War.\" The article mentions that, following the war, the U.S. Congress expressed gratitude for the Oneidas' assistance, granting them reparations and \"relative peace,\" before noting that \"that gratitude did not always translate into equitable treatment.\"\n\nThis appears to be a mealy-mouthed reference to the fact that at the end of the Revolutionary War, the Oneida Homelands were estimated at about between five to six million acres of land . Over the century that followed, a raft of federal and New York state treaties and rulings reduced the territory to just 32 acres by the early 1900s. (The Pentagon did not reply to a request to interview the author of the piece.)\n\nThe nascent U.S. military was less generous to Native Americans who didn't join their colonial rebellion and sided with the British.\n\nIn 1779, George Washington ordered a scorched-earth campaign to bring about the \"total ruin\" of Six Nations settlements across hundreds of miles of Pennsylvania and New York. \"The immediate objects are the total destruction and devastation of their settlements and the capture of as many prisoners of every age and sex as possible. It will be essential to ruin their crops,\" read the orders sent to Maj. Gen. John Sullivan. \"Our future security will be in their inability to injure us the distance to which they are driven and in the terror with which the severity of the chastisement they receive will inspire.\" When the operation was over, Sullivan's army had destroyed more than 40 villages and at least 160,000 bushels of corn.\n\nThe Pentagon's celebratory articles about Native Americans' cheerful service in the U.S. military and glaring historical gaps are further undermined by more accurate information available - if tucked away - on the U.S. Army Center of Military History's own website.\n\nThere, the Army chronicles 14 named \" Indian Wars Campaigns \" stretching from the 1790s to the 1890s. That official history is a triumphant story of \"expeditions\" against \"restless\" and \"hostile Indians\" who were seen as an \"obstacle to expansion\"; Native people who act \"treacherously\" and exhibit \"unrest\" in reaction to \"an influx of miners, and extension of railroads\"; the destruction of Indigenous villages leading to \"rapid settlement\" in new areas by whites; defeats of tribes \"on the warpath\"; Native leaders hanged and \"killed resisting arrest\"; and Indigenous people - including \"squaws\" and children - forced from their lands; all culminating in a slaughter at Wounded Knee in South Dakota, which even the Army's history accurately portrays as a massacre:\n\nOn 15 December 1890, bureau police killed Sitting Bull ... while trying to arrest him. ... On the morning of 29 December, an effort to disarm [a group of Native religious revivalists] led to a shot being fired. It may have been an accidental discharge ... but whatever the source, it led immediately to heavy and indiscriminate firing from soldiers and some return fire from the Lakota. ... The soldiers also employed artillery despite the presence of numerous noncombatants. ... When it was over, more than two hundred Lakota (perhaps as many as three hundred), including women and children, were dead. Army casualties totaled 25 killed and 39 wounded, some of whom likely were hit by friendly fire. ... The Army conducted an investigation of the incident but never determined culpability.\n\nDespite the racism and brutality toward Native Americans evident in the Army's official chronicle, many of its worst atrocities against Indigenous people are conspicuously absent from the account.\n\nIn 1838, for example, Gen. Winfield Scott issued orders, on behalf of President Martin Van Buren, for eastern Cherokees to leave their ancestral homeland. An estimated 17,000 were driven from their homes, sometimes at gunpoint with few or no possessions as white looters ransacked their homes. Many were also put into internment camps before being pushed westward to what is now Oklahoma; a military-enforced displacement that became known as the Trail of Tears. Cherokee authorities estimate that 6,000 men, women, and children died on the 1,200-mile march.\n\nAfter the Cherokee, the Army continued to forcibly displace other Native Americans . All told, around 88,000 people indigenous to the eastern United States were pushed westward in the 1830s and 1840s. Up to 19 percent died as a result.\n\nSome of the most egregious U.S. military violence against Native Americans occurred during the Civil War. During these years, President Abraham Lincoln's forces reserved their most vicious treatment not for the traitorous Confederacy, but for members of Native American tribes, subjecting them to depredations far worse than those meted out against white southerners.\n\n\"The Army's mission could take different forms. Sometimes it could be removal. Sometimes they massacred people. It happened more in the American West than in the American East. But that basic template is there from the 1780s into the 1890s,\" said Ostler. \"The Army conducted surprise attacks designed to kill as many people as possible, including women and children, old men, babies. Everyone. This wasn't out-of-control commanders. This was policy.\"\n\nIn 1862, Col. James H. Carleton, the head of the U.S. Department of New Mexico, decided that Indigenous people must \"give way to the insatiable progress of our race.\" To that end, he issued orders to frontiersman Christopher \"Kit\" Carson: \"All Indian men of [the Mescalero Apache] tribe are to be killed whenever and wherever you can find them.\" Carleton issued similar orders for the Navajo, as well. Carson, as a result, conducted a scorched-earth campaign , burning villages, slaughtering livestock, destroying water wells, forcing the Navajo to surrender, and then subjecting them to a forced march over hundreds of miles to an internment camp. Thousands died as a result.\n\nIn 1863, the U.S. military committed one of its largest single-day atrocities to date, near what's now Preston, Idaho. Col. Patrick Edward Connor employed four companies of cavalry , one of infantry, and artillery against the Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation. \"Kill everything!\" he ordered. \"Nits make lice.\"\n\nThe U.S. troops went on a killing spree, shooting defenseless men, women, and children. Some troops reportedly raped women even as they lay dying while others used axes to bash in the heads of wounded children. By some counts, 250 Shoshone were slain , including 90 women and children. The tribe's written history of the Bear River massacre estimates 350 deaths. Hans Jasperson , in his 1911 autobiography, said he walked among the corpses, counting 493 dead Shoshones. \"I turned around and counted them back and counted just the same,\" he wrote. Following the slaughter, Connor was promoted to brigadier general for his \"heroic conduct.\"\n\nAfter Gen. John Pope was bested by the Confederacy's Robert E. Lee at the Second Battle of Manassas in August 1862, he was sent West to make war on Native people. \"It is my purpose utterly to exterminate the Sioux if I have the power to do so,\" he wrote . \"They are to be treated as maniacs or wild beasts.\" While attempting to hunt down Santees in 1863, Pope's forces encountered camps of peaceful Yanktonai, Hunkpapa, and Sioux , many of whom they killed. One American witness to the campaign said forces under Pope did \"what no decent man would have done,\" noting that they slaughtered women and children in what he called a \" perfect massacre .\"\n\nIn the Nebraska Territory in 1863, a group of Ponca were confronted by Seventh Iowa Cavalry troops. Brandishing revolvers, they offered the Native women money for sex and were rebuffed. The Ponca women fled, but the next morning the Americans tracked them down and killed three women and a young girl. The U.S. government called it a \" very unfortunate occurrence ,\" but the next year an official report noted that \"the murderers of several of this loyal and friendly tribe\" had not been punished.\n\nCol. John Chivington, the head of the Colorado military district, was another U.S. commander with a hatred for Indigenous people. \"Damn any man who sympathizes with Indians!\" he told his troops . \"I have come to kill Indians, and believe it is right and honorable to use any means under God's heaven to kill Indians.\"\n\nFollowing numerous depredations by men under Chivington's command, the \"peace chief\" Black Kettle of allied Cheyenne and Arapaho groups met with Army officers and negotiated a truce in September 1864.\n\nDespite this, Chivington declared \"scalps are what we are after\" and led more than 700 troops to attack Black Kettle's camp at dawn on November 29, 1864. In what the colonel called \"an act of duty to ourselves and to civilization,\" his men unleashed gunfire and artillery on the sleeping village.\n\nIn testimony before members of the U.S. House of Representatives, John S. Smith, a U.S. government official, testified that he watched Chivington's troops massacre hundreds at Sand Creek. Questioned by Massachusetts Republican Daniel W. Gooch and Charles R. Buckalew, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, Smith detailed the horrors :\n\nMr. Gooch: Were the women and children slaughtered indiscriminately, or only so far as they were with the warriors?\n\nSmith: Indiscriminately.\n\nMr. Gooch: Were there any acts of barbarity perpetrated there that came under your own observation?\n\nSmith: Yes, sir; I saw the bodies of those lying there cut all to pieces, worse mutilated than any I ever saw before; the women cut all to pieces.\n\nMr. Buckalew: How cut?\n\nSmith: With knives; scalped; their brains knocked out; children two or three months old; all ages lying there, from sucking infants up to warriors.\n\nMr. Gooch: Did you see it done?\n\nSmith: Yes, sir; I saw them fall.\n\nMr. Gooch: Fall when they were killed?\n\nSmith: Yes, sir.\n\nMr. Gooch: Did you see them when they were mutilated?\n\nSmith: Yes, sir.\n\nMr. Gooch: By whom were they mutilated?\n\nSmith: By the United States troops.\n\nFor almost four hours, U.S. forces slaughtered the camp's inhabitants, two-thirds of them women and children. Many Native women were also raped and mutilated, and Native American scalps, breasts, and genitalia were taken as souvenirs. In an after-action report, Chivington wrote of \" making almost an annihilation of the entire tribe \" and then in a letter to Maj. Gen. Samuel Curtis stated: \"It may, perhaps, be unnecessary for me to state that I captured no prisoners. Between five and six hundred Indians were left dead upon the field.\" No court martial was ever convened, and no punishments were meted out in connection with the massacre.\n\n\"I don't think that your average person truly understands the levels of violence and coercion and destruction done to Native peoples and the direct involvement in the military in perpetuating that violence,\" said Richotte. \"A more honest telling of this history would, perhaps, force us to reckon with our understandings of that past.\"\n\nOne hundred and sixty years after the Army failed to hold anyone accountable for hundreds of people massacred at Sand Creek, that service is honoring the \"culture and heritage of Native Americans and Alaska Natives\" by telling a story that, like Hicks's history, begins with World War II .\n\nThe hidden history excised by the Army, which includes sporadic battles with small bands of Native Americans into the 20th century, is one of success in dispossessing Indigenous people. Today, the effort to wrest land from Native Americans - chronicled in the Army's history of the \"Indian Wars\" - is complete. The amount of land Native tribes currently have compared to what they once possessed shrank by 98.9 percent, according to a 2021 study in the journal Science . In many cases, however, no comparison was even possible. Of the 380 tribes analyzed, 160 no longer had any federally or state-recognized land.\n\nWhile atrocities and forced displacement have been edited out of the Pentagon's historical narrative, it is notable that numerous stories offered by the military this month still reference Native Americans' struggles with outdated notions , racism, and cultural depredations. In one article, for instance, Sgt. 1st Class Lynette Eriacho , a soldier and member of the Navajo Nation, said she has \"been asked whether Native Americans are all alcoholics, or if they still live in teepees.\" Another piece offered up by the Army admonished troops and other Americans not to desecrate sacred sites and steal Native American artifacts .\n\nThe Pentagon has also shown a modicum of progress toward confronting its sordid past. This summer, the Defense Department announced that it will review the Medals of Honor given to 20 U.S. soldiers for carrying out the slaughter at Wounded Knee in 1890. The Pentagon did not respond to a request by The Intercept for the status of that review.\n\nThe Army also signaled that it will express regret for an 1869 terror campaign that included the shelling of a Lingít village near Wrangell, Alaska. In recent months, the Navy apologized \"for wrongful U.S. military actions against Tlingit villages in Kake in 1869 and Angoon in 1882\" - two communities packed with civilians that were devastated by U.S. attacks.\n\n\"We need a reckoning with our past,\" said Ostler. \"All nations need to grapple with their past in order to create a just society.\" The Pentagon did not respond to questions by The Intercept about criticisms of its Native American Heritage Month celebrations and its selective history of U.S. military interactions with Native people.\n\nRichotte called the Pentagon's recent apologies to select Native people \"a good start\" but said it was only that: a start. \"If it's simply an acknowledgement, it's hard to see it as quite enough. If all we're left with is just words without some sort of additional meaningful action, then it seems to fall short of the promise of those types of acknowledgments in the first place,\" he told The Intercept.\n\n\"Colonialism benefits by making Indigenous peoples invisible,\" said Richotte. \"And as long as that remains the case - as long as the few markers of visibility are perpetuated under the colonizers - nothing is going to change.\"\n\nCorrection: December 27, 2024 A paragraph describing an article posted on the Pentagon website about the history of the U.S. relationship with the Oneida Nation was mistakenly omitted from this article. It has been added back in.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Native American Sovereignty Is Under Attack. Here's How Elizabeth Warren's DNA Test Hurt Our Struggle.\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nElizabeth Warren took the bait on Donald Trump's racist \"Pocahontas\" DNA challenge. Her reaction hurt more than she might realize.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren speaks to the Boston Globe's editorial board at the newspaper's office in Boston, Mass., on Oct. 16, 2018.\n\nHalf a century ago, the Standing Rock Dakota scholar Vine Deloria Jr. wrote, \"Whites claiming Indian blood tend to reinforce mythical beliefs about Indians.\" Throughout her career, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., has used that mythical belief - what Deloria mocked as the \"Indian-grandmother complex\" - to stake a claim to Native American identity, like how her European settler ancestors staked a claim to land once called Indian Territory, or what is currently Oklahoma. For Warren, her claims are like a moving target. At one time, it was \"Cherokee.\" Now it's just generic \"Native American ancestry.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump, being a bigot, has consistently taunted Warren - frequently referring to her as \" Pocahontas \" - about her claims with a million-dollar wager : Take a DNA test to prove she's \"an Indian.\" It was an obvious ploy, and Warren took the bait.\n\nYet her reaction hurt more than she might realize. Reducing Native American identity to \"race,\" whether through biology or the law, is harmful to Native sovereignty and nationhood, despite Warren's professed good intentions. Warren, however, didn't walk into Trump's trap with her eyes closed. What she didn't see, however, was how low Trump had set the bar when he said \"jump\" and she tripped on it, landing face first - on stolen Native land.\n\nLike many Native people, I am jealous of Warren and white people like her. Native plebeians, such as myself, a poor Indian kid born on the wrong side of the tracks in Podunk, South Dakota, lack her pedigree and life story. She might as well have rare Romanov ancestry, a secret but ill-fated royal bloodline, when compared to my proletarian biography.\n\nIt was Warren's self-identified Republican family members - the white guys drinking beer telling family stories in a living room - that bolstered her Native credentials in a recent video defending her \"Native American ancestry.\" I wish I had such relatives to do the same for me, but, if my relatives were captured drinking like that on camera, they might spend a night in the slammer or get labeled as \" drunk Indians .\"\n\nThere is an irony here. The white guys drinking beer have become the arbiters of Native identity, while those who have survived genocide and the theft of an entire continent have become mere background noise to the spectacle of powerful elites duking it out for control over land that is not rightfully theirs. Such is the history of the United States.\n\nThe worst irony, though, is Warren's appropriation of Native identity while simultaneously fetishizing and instrumentalizing it. To Warren, Native people are little more than a currency, a million-dollar ticket to the White House, a one-up to Trump. That's how this game has been played so far: Trump asked her to prove that she's \"an Indian\" (not that she has \"ancestry\") with a DNA test, something that is, by all accounts, impossible. Indianness isn't defined by DNA . It's a legal, social, cultural, and historical construct, where Indigenous nations self-define the parameters of belonging. Put simply, it's not about who you claim, it's about who claims you. In response to Warren, the Cherokee Nation issued a statement saying that \"using a DNA test to lay claim to any connection to the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation, even vaguely, is inappropriate and wrong.\"\n\nFalsely claiming Native American identity is a white American tradition, with a deeply racist past. Forrest Carter, also known as Asa Earl Carter - a Ku Klux Klan leader and the former speechwriter for George Wallace (he co-wrote Wallace's famous 1963 line, \"Segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever\") - reinvented himself later in life as a \" Cherokee \" writer of the famous children's book \"The Education of Little Tree.\" Famous white Southern Americans like Miley Cyrus, Johnny Cash, and Bill Clinton have also all falsely claimed \" Cherokee heritage. \"\n\nI'll admit, I'm not a geneticist. (And I'd refer anyone interested in the political and social aspects of \"Native American DNA\" to read Kim Tallbear's excellent book on the subject .) I am, however, a historian and I can tell you that proving \"Native American ancestry\" by using Native body parts has a long, racist history. Genes are part of the human body, and to use genes to measure a degree or percentage of race to make a scientific claim is called race science, which discredits the legitimate science of DNA testing.\n\nA century ago, Native people were considered a disappearing people. Anthropologists and others flooded Indian reservations intent on preserving the last vestiges of a dying race. With them, they brought calipers to measure Native skulls from the graves they robbed. Sometimes they used captured Indigenous children in boarding schools and prisoners of war for racial experiments, displaying their live specimens at traveling zoological exhibits. The goal was to prove a racial and civilizational superiority by showing just how far white Europeans had evolved from primitive conditions.\n\nSuch a people were also seen as too incompetent to manage their own lands and raise their own children. Their land and children were taken from them for their own good. The children were placed into the special care of white families and the land into the hands of white farmers (like Warren's settler ancestors). Those who could not be killed or assimilated were placed under the supervision of the Department of Interior, which manages wildlife and public lands, where it was hoped that they would just disappear.\n\nIn other words, Native people, living or dead, were relegated to a tragic past with no place in the future of a white settler nation. Their identities and lands were simply absorbed and made into sports mascots and names for states and military equipment. Countless Native people were lost to this system , torn from their families and their Indigenous nations. Indigenous nations are still searching to reclaim their lost relatives - but Warren is not one of those people.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nWhile Warren and white people like her are rushing to get DNA tests that prove \"Native American ancestry,\" there is less enthusiasm among white people about proving \"African ancestry.\" That's the unspoken racist undertone of this whole debate, especially since many Black Americans have actual connections to Indigenous nations of this hemisphere. The \"one-drop rule\" of African ancestry, a racial calculus created to increase the size of slaveowners' property through biological reproduction, was designed to make one Black and nothing more - not Indigenous and especially not white. (Even the descendants of Cherokee slaves were disallowed tribal citizenship until recently .)\n\nThese racial logics simply don't grant Black and Native people the same visibility or authority over their own identities the same way they do to a powerful white woman who takes a DNA test. That's called white supremacy.\n\nWarren's claims and Trump's attacks have never been about upholding Native sovereignty. It's pure opportunism. While Trump applauded the Cherokee Nation's dismissal of Warren's claims, his self-proclaimed policy of \"American carnage\" has opened billions of acres for offshore drilling - threatening circumpolar Indigenous nations as ice sheets melt and global temperatures rise - and has opened millions of acres of the Bears Ears National Monument, a once-protected Indigenous sacred site in the Southwest, for coal and uranium mining.\n\nAnd North Dakota recently passed legislation disenfranchising thousands of Native American voters in the state, in places like Standing Rock that desperately fought the Dakota Access pipeline. Today, Standing Rock and the entire Sioux Nation in the Northern Plains are planning to halt the trespass of the Keystone XL pipeline through our treaty territory, a pipeline that imperils our water, our sovereignty, and therefore our lives.\n\nThere are plenty of other examples. Some are even race-based, along the lines of the pseudoscience through which Warren tried to hitch her wagon to Native Americans. A federal court recently ruled that the Indian Child Welfare Act, a four decade-old law created to keep Native families intact, is \" race-based \" legislation and therefore \"unconstitutional.\" Created to protect children who are members of Native nations or whose biological parents are members of Native nations, the law, in fact, was designed to prevent the disintegration of Native nations: the widespread practice of taking Native children and adopting them out to white families or placing them into state foster care systems.\n\nWhile Indigenous nations face existential threats - from losing their children, land, and water - Warren's conflation of her \"Native American ancestry\" with Native American identity only continues a history of theft. The purposeful distortion and misunderstanding of Native sovereignty and identity, whether by Trump or Warren, is a longstanding tradition of American imperialism that has facilitated the taking of resources, whether they're Native lands or Native bodies. And we still want our stolen relatives and stolen land back, regardless of the settler infighting currently taking place.\n\nWarren has taken some concrete steps in an effort to help Native Americans, but her recent entry into the waters of Native identity stands to outweigh any efforts she has made for Natives. I'm not holding my breath for her to do the right thing - such as making a formal apology . Like Vine Deloria, the Standing Rock Dakota writer whose people are currently under threat, I don't resent white people like Warren. I just hope she can accept herself and just leave us alone.\n\nWhile Warren has become the punchline of a lot of jokes in Indian Country - \"I'm Cherokee on my white side,\" and so on - boiling Native American identity and race down to biology, and, more specifically, genomics, is racist. It needs to stop.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

When his father died while Roosevelt was attending Harvard, he inherited the equivalent of about $3 million today. While in his twenties, Roosevelt invested a significant percentage of this money in the cattle business out west. This led him to spend large amounts of time in Montana and the Dakotas in the years just before they became states in 1889.\n\nDuring this period, Roosevelt developed an attitude toward Native Americans that can fairly be described as genocidal. In an 1886 speech in New York, he declared :\n\nI don't go so far as to think that the only good Indian is the dead Indian, but I believe nine out of every ten are, and I shouldn't like to inquire too closely into the case of the tenth. The most vicious cowboy has more moral principle than the average Indian. Take three hundred low families of New York and New Jersey, support them, for fifty years, in vicious idleness, and you will have some idea of what the Indians are. Reckless, revengeful, fiendishly cruel.\n\nThat same year Roosevelt published a book in which he wrote that \"the so-called Chivington or Sandy [sic] Creek Massacre, in spite of certain most objectionable details, was on the whole as righteous and beneficial a deed as ever took place on the frontier.\"\n\nThe Sand Creek massacre had occurred 22 years previously in the Colorado Territory, wiping out a village of over 100 Cheyenne and Arapaho people. It was in every way comparable to the My Lai massacre during the Vietnam War. Nelson A. Miles, an officer who eventually became the Army's top general, wrote in his memoirs that it was \"perhaps the foulest and most unjustifiable crime in the annals of America.\"\n\nThe assault was led by Col. John Chivington, who famously said, \"I have come to kill Indians. ... Kill and scalp all, big and little; nits make lice.\" Soldiers later reported that after killing men, women, and children, they mutilated their bodies for trophies. One lieutenant stated in a congressional investigation that \"I heard that the privates of White Antelope had been cut off to make a tobacco bag out of.\"\n\nIn a subsequent book, \"The Winning of the West,\" Roosevelt explained that U.S. actions toward American Indians were part of the larger, noble endeavor of European colonialism:\n\nAll men of sane and wholesome thought must dismiss with impatient contempt the plea that these continents should be reserved for the use of scattered savage tribes. ... Most fortunately, the hard, energetic, practical men who do the rough pioneer work of civilization in barbarous lands, are not prone to false sentimentality. The people who are, these stay-at-homes are too selfish and indolent, too lacking in imagination, to understand the race-importance of the work which is done by their pioneer brethren in wild and distant lands. ...\n\nThe most ultimately righteous of all wars is a war with savages. ... American and Indian, Boer and Zulu, Cossack and Tartar, New Zealander and Maori,-in each case the victor, horrible though many of his deeds are, has laid deep the foundations for the future greatness of a mighty people.\n\nIt is no exaggeration to call this Hitlerian. And while it's extremely unpopular to say so, Nazism was not just rhetorically similar to European colonialism, it was an outgrowth of it and its logical culmination .\n\nIn a 1928 speech, Adolf Hitler was already speaking approvingly of how Americans had \"gunned down the millions of Redskins to a few hundred thousands, and now keep the modest remnant under observation in a cage.\" In 1941, Hitler told confidants of his plans to \"Europeanize\" Russia. It wasn't just Germans who would do this, he said, but Scandinavians and Americans, \"all those who have a feeling for Europe.\" The most important thing was to \"look upon the natives as Redskins.\"\n\nWhat this means for the innumerable celebrations of Roosevelt across the U.S. is up to us. But if we proceed honestly, we will face a reckoning with something even more monumental than the history of America.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Standing Rock Pitches Last-Ditch Fight for the Right to Vote in North Dakota\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nStanding Rock tribal members were skeptical of supporting Democrat Sen. Heidi Heitkamp. Then Republicans attempted to stop them from voting at all.\n\nTo find Honorata Defender's home on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, mention her name to whoever you can find walking down the main street of her tiny town. They'll tell you to turn when you get to the powwow grounds and to take the paved road, rather than the gravel one. Drive until you see a hill, and look for her car. Her house has no number on it, and mail is not delivered there; it goes to a P.O. box instead.\n\nAs Defender put it, \"We've never believed that a person can own land; it's the land that owns us.\" She added, \"The concept of an address wasn't a big deal.\"\n\nDefender was working at her job as a reporter for the Corson/Sioux County News-Messenger - the local paper that covers Standing Rock, including one of the key North Dakota counties that voted Democrat in 2012's Senate election - when she learned that the U.S. Supreme Court had upheld North Dakota's voter ID law. The law will require each voter to present identification that displays a residential address, a major barrier for tribal members, since thousands of Native voters don't use a home address. Defender's home is on the South Dakota side of Standing Rock, but it is typical of the communities throughout the reservation.\n\nThe law is widely understood as the result of Republican state Congress members' cynical mathematics. Six years ago, North Dakota Native Americans helped swing Democrat Heidi Heitkamp narrowly into the U.S. Senate by less than 3,000 votes. The next year, state Republicans introduced the new law. Tribes fought it in court up until October 9, when the Supreme Court declined to support their appeal.\n\n\"To have this happen is a slap in the face,\" Defender said. \"The U.S. government has been breaking their promises to us for over a century now.\" The timing of the court's decision left the state's five federally recognized tribes with only a few short weeks to make sure that members who do not have home addresses - or do not know them - are able to participate in a highly contested election that will help decide which party controls Congress.\n\nHoronata Defender at the voter drive headquarters.\n\nTribal leaders contend that the state government has provided no meaningful support in ensuring that eligible Native voters will be able to overcome the new hurdle. On Thursday, North Dakota District Court Chief Judge Daniel Hovland denied a last-minute request for an emergency halt to enforcement of the new law in advance of the midterm elections. The suit, brought by the Spirit Lake tribe and six Native voters across the state, described the law's implementation as \"unplanned, untested, and broken.\" Hovland contended that halting the law's implementation so close to the election would sow even more confusion and chaos.\n\nIn response, a tenacious voter drive has emerged on Standing Rock, led by some of the key figures in the tribe's 2016 fight against Energy Transfer's Dakota Access pipeline, which drew thousands of pipeline opponents to resistance camps on the edge of the reservation. Ultimately, the pipeline was completed, and oil now flows under the Missouri River, long the primary drinking water source for the reservation.\n\nThe drive's organizers see their efforts to counteract the new law as yet another demonstration of what Indigenous people are capable of when their right to exist is challenged. But it is not a campaign for Heitkamp, who remains a controversial figure on Standing Rock. \"She did not support us on DAPL; she blindsided us,\" explained Phyllis Young, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and get-out-the-vote organizer.\n\nDuring the pipeline fight, Heitkamp issued statements in support of law enforcement, calling some of the protesters \"violent and unlawful\" less than two weeks after police hosed them down with icy water in below-freezing weather. Before that, she was a key supporter of ending the crude oil export ban, which helped fuel demand for a pipeline, and she has declined to stand up to the oil, gas, and coal industries in the face of the climate crisis. Notably, she was one of only two Democratic senators to vote in favor of confirming Scott Pruitt as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nBut the stakes of having Native voices represented in the U.S. government are high. And in many ways, Heitkamp has been a rare advocate in Congress for Native Americans, spearheading efforts to address human trafficking and violence against women, and pushing for the creation of a commission to address issues facing Indigenous children.\n\n\"We abandoned her\" after DAPL, said Young. \"She is redeeming herself.\"\n\nThe issue that has obsessed Defender as a reporter is the looming expiration in December of the Violence Against Women Act, which, among other things, offers a means for tribes to prosecute cases of domestic violence committed by non-Native people on the reservation, and includes funding to address an epidemic of missing and murdered Indigenous women. To Defender, VAWA's future is inherently linked to the voter ID issue and an example of why it's so important for tribal members to vote this election. It's an issue Heitkamp has championed.\n\nDefender was one of the earliest participants in the Dakota Access pipeline resistance, but she understands Heitkamp's pipeline silence as a compromise to be expected from a Democrat in such an oil-soaked, Republican state. For Defender, the potential consequences for Native women of losing an advocate in the Senate are too great to place the weight of her political position on DAPL. But the even greater threat is that the new law will affirm a perception that Native people can remain invisible.\n\n\"My biggest fear is that this won't work,\" she said of the voter drive. \"And that'll push us back to feeling like we don't matter, our voice doesn't matter. We're going back to when we weren't citizens of this place even though we were here first.\"\n\n\"My greatest hope is that we have the biggest Native American voting drive that we've ever had,\" she said. \"I'm hoping that, whoever wins, that Native Americans will be able to vote.\"\n\nVolunteers moving furniture at the voter drive headquarters.\n\nOn a crisp October day, a week and a half after the Supreme Court decision, Young directed activities as a small house typically rented out by the tribe for birthday parties was transformed into a voter drive headquarters. Furniture that had been used by the Water Protectors Legal Collective, which provided representation to those arrested during the pipeline fight, was being pulled out of storage and repurposed. A staffer from the Lakota People's Law Project, which also provided DAPL-related legal support, volunteered to field phone calls from the media. Posting the house's address outside was on the agenda. It wasn't that no address had ever been assigned to the building; the numbers had simply blown off on one of the prairie region's windy days.\n\nLong before she became involved in attempting to stop construction of the Dakota Access pipeline, Young co-founded the Women of All Red Nations arm of the American Indian Movement, or AIM, where she fought for the fulfillment of treaty rights and an end to forced sterilization of Indigenous women. When she ran communications during AIM's occupation of Wounded Knee, South Dakota, in 1973, residents of the community were still not allowed to vote in county elections. In a community where people have always had to fight for survival under harmful U.S. government policies, one movement can quickly bleed into another, and nothing kicks people into gear like a U.S. government-induced crisis.\n\n\"It's innate in us to defend our people,\" said Jenn Ghost Bear, Young's niece.\n\nYoung's granddaughter, 27-year-old Danielle Ta'Sheena Finn, the tribe's external affairs director, said the get-out-the-vote effort was accelerated by the challenge to Native people's right to participate. \"Before, we were more hesitant on this election because the two Senate candidates, we have had issues with in the past,\" she said. As Standing Rock's first Miss Indian World in 2016, Finn used her platform to speak out against DAPL.\n\nBut although Heitkamp's silence on the pipeline is a black mark on her record, her opponent's reputation is worse. Republican Kevin Cramer, currently a U.S. representative, is notorious for a 2013 tirade against the tribal provisions of the Violence Against Women Act during a meeting with a Native advocate for survivors of domestic abuse. According to the account of attendee Melissa Merrick, Cramer claimed that tribal governments were dysfunctional and that a non-Native man would not be able to get a fair trial on a reservation, adding that he wanted to \"wring the tribal council's neck and slam them against the wall,\" in reference to a scandal related to the Spirit Lake tribe's child welfare program. Since then, he's become a co-sponsor of a House bill that would strengthen some provisions of VAWA, but he has failed to earn many Native people's trust.\n\n\"Due to this law being placed on us, people now realized that if we don't stand up, we will be oppressed further,\" said Finn.\n\nMany of the eligible voters the drive is targeting face challenges beyond just having the right address. According to the Census Bureau's most recent American Community Survey, 38 percent of Sioux County's population lives below the poverty line. Many people lack vehicles or cellphones.\n\nYoung and her team have been spreading word that the tribe has waived the fee for issuing tribal IDs, offering them for free. But to pick up the ID, residents have to go all the way to Fort Yates, nearly 100 miles away from Standing Rock's western border. As a result, one of the voter drive's key tasks has been to make it as easy as possible for people to get to the polls. Young has been busy tracking down drivers willing to take voters to Fort Yates to pick up the ID and, while they're in town, submit an absentee ballot.\n\nAlso taking direction from Young were OJ and Barb Semans, founders of the Native voter rights group Four Directions. The organization is working with students at Claremont Graduate University to help the tribe set up a \"fail-safe\" system so that even voters who show up to polls without the right ID will be able to vote.\n\nNorth Dakota Secretary of State Al Jaeger has encouraged eligible voters who lack a residential address to request one through the 911 system. Years ago, in an attempt to manage the challenges of providing emergency services to homes that lack addresses, the 911 system mapped residences on the state's reservations. Yet Spirit Lake's lawsuit underlines that the system is unreliable, \"characterized by disarray, errors, confusion, and missing or conflicting addresses.\" According to the suit, at least one individual submitted an absentee ballot using their 911-assigned address only to have it rejected. In some cases, coordinators, who are often law enforcement officers, have simply been unavailable to respond to requests. The state has argued in the past that an ID is necessary because other methods of proving voter eligibility are \"self-authenticating.\" Yet, to obtain a 911 address, callers simply describe where they live without providing any verification.\n\nThe case of 69-year-old plaintiff and Standing Rock member Terry Yellow Fat is an example of the chaotic situation facing reservation residents. According to the suit, a few years ago a sign reading \"Buffalo Avenue\" mysteriously showed up near his home. He figured Buffalo was his street. Still, he decided to request an address from the 911 coordinator, who happens to also be the county sheriff. To his surprise, the sheriff gave him an address on 92nd Street. Yet when he attempted to have UPS deliver a package there, the parcel never arrived. A delivery driver let him know that the address actually belongs to a nearby liquor store. The error has been perceived by some as a racist jab by the county's lead law enforcement officer. Meanwhile, Yellow Fat's ID lists his P.O. box, and his assigned 911 address is incorrect. How he'll vote remains unclear.\n\nFour Directions' system would allow voters to identify where they live on a map and then be assigned an address on the spot. Jaeger has declined to endorse it.\n\nOJ and Barb Semans at the voter drive headquarters.\n\nFor the Semans, none of what's happening in North Dakota is new. \"Any time we've won an election, when there's an election and their candidate loses, the first one they say committed fraud are Indians,\" said OJ Semans.\n\nDemocrats haven't consistently stood up for Native voters either. \"They all looked down on us until they found out they could use our vote,\" said Barb Semans.\n\nAmerican Indians were only made full citizens of the U.S. in 1924, but states have continued to find creative ways to deny Native people access to the ballot ever since. Until 1975 in South Dakota, for example, residents of counties considered unorganized under state law could not vote in county elections. Of course, the only counties that fit that description were Todd, Oglala (at the time known as Shannon), and Washabaugh, which are located within the Rosebud and Pine Ridge reservations.\n\nThat legacy is another barrier to getting Native voters to the polls. Defender said family members have told her stories of being turned away. \"It put this feeling, this thought, into their heads that they shouldn't even try to vote,\" she said. \"And that carried on into the next generation because they sit there and tell their kids, why bother?\"\n\nFour Directions started after another election in which Native voters tipped the scale. At the close of voting day in 2002, polls indicated that the Democratic Senate incumbent Tim Johnson had lost to his Republican opponent Jim Thune. But by morning, the scales had tipped by a meager 528 votes.\n\nBarb Semans and her effort to get out the Native vote on the Rosebud Sioux reservation in South Dakota was credited for the narrow win. At first, when Semans started working on the campaign, she said, \"They insisted we do it the white way.\" The campaign flew in door-knockers from out of town to ask for Native people's vote. \"They didn't get one registered voter.\"\n\nBarb Semans told them that if a strange white guy knocks at your door on the reservation, \"it's either a church person trying to convert you or an FBI agent. I knew it wouldn't work,\" she said. \"We had the white guys drive the van and the Indians knocked.\"\n\n\"We were able to really get people excited,\" said OJ Semans. \"Why not elect someone that understood our treaties and got along with us? When you start talking about actually doing this to protect your treaties, people understood that and were willing to participate.\"\n\nThe voter drive was effective, yet unexpected barriers continued to arise. The Semans said that on voting day, the auditor opened Rosebud's poll in Central time, even though the reservation operated in Mountain time. The campaign demanded an extra hour and got it. Based on polls campaign workers took on the reservation, the couple estimates that the final hour may have tipped the scales. Altogether, hundreds of voters participated who had previously sat out the elections.\n\nSince then, Four Directions has sued officials in South Dakota, Montana, and Nevada to open new and accessible offices where tribal members can obtain and submit absentee ballots without traveling exceedingly long distances. OJ Semans said they've developed a reputation. \"If we say you're not doing what you're supposed to do, and you disagree with us, we will sue you; we will take you to court until we win.\"\n\nA key factor has been relying on the communities where they're working. \"We don't operate outside what the council wants us to do, and we don't come here with a bunch of people to take over,\" he said. \"We look at the people here, and we utilize them as the leaders.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe urgency to make sure that Native voices are included in the North Dakota election has been heightened by recent actions by the Trump administration and others. The administration recently announced that it would take the lands of the Mashpee Wampanoag in Massachusetts out of trust - something that has not been done since the termination era when the federal government systematically ended its relationships with numerous tribes in an attempt at forced assimilation. Meanwhile, the Indian Child Welfare Act, which protects Native children from being easily removed from their families, was recently declared unconstitutional by a Bush-appointed judge in Texas. And Native people have not forgotten that Trump advisers advocated privatizing reservation land.\n\nRepresentation of Native interests has long been thin in Congress. There are currently only two Native members of Congress, both Republican representatives from Oklahoma. And, according to a Senate website, there have been only three Native senators, none of whom are in office.\n\nBut Native people are increasingly throwing around their electoral weight. In fact, 2018 is already a historic year for Native candidates, especially women. In New Mexico, Democrat Deb Haaland is expected to become the first Native woman ever to serve in Congress as a U.S. representative, and in Idaho, Democrat Paulette Jordan is vying to be the nation's first Native American governor. South Dakota, too, has an array of Native candidates running for state offices.\n\nBut none of that suggests that the Semans's work will get easier. As OJ Semans put it, \"The more we fight, the more laws they come up with.\" And in South Dakota, a court order requiring the state to maintain accessible offices for absentee voting on the Pine Ridge reservation expires this year. \"We'll probably have to start all over again.\"\n\nFloris White Bull, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe speaks with Sen. Heidi Heitkamp at a rally.\n\nAt the Prairie Knights Casino on the northeastern edge of the reservation, Sen. Heidi Heitkamp stood before a banquet hall filled with tribal members, asking for their vote on November 6. The quiet in the room deepened as Heitkamp named two young mothers who disappeared and were later found dead in the past two years, Savanna Greywind, a member of the Spirit Lake tribe, and Olivia Lone Bear, of the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation. She described her work on the Violence Against Women Act and her efforts to pass Savanna's Law , written to improve efforts in the criminal justice system to deal with the epidemic of disappearances of Indigenous women. Audience members applauded when she noted her vote against Brett Kavanaugh's appointment as a Supreme Court justice.\n\nBut there was one issue - the Dakota Access Pipeline - that she referenced only cryptically. \"I'm humbled by the turnout because I know there's been disappointment,\" said Heitkamp. \"Indian people are forgiving people.\"\n\nAs the Heitkamp event ended, the senator shook hands with various constituents as she exited. Fifty-nine-year-old Charlotte Ramsey broke down as she asked the senator to do something about the meth epidemic. And Floris White Bull's voice cracked as she described being locked in a dog kennel for protesting the pipeline. \"I want to be able to support you, and I know that a lot of people of my community want to support you, but I feel let down,\" she said. \"You talk about giving us a voice, and you talk about our children, but respect our water was ignored.\"\n\n\"What amends can be made?\" she asked.\n\n\"We can't go back to where we were, but we can move forward. That's why I said I was grateful and humbled,\" Heitkamp replied. \"Unfortunately you don't have the choice between someone who's perfect or someone who isn't. From your perspective, I'm not perfect, so you'll have to decide whether I'm someone that you can support.\"\n\nWhite Bull listened intently, lips pursed, as Heitkamp continued, \"I intend to do everything I can to improve housing, to improve education, to improve access to justice for women. I think the question is, How do you move forward?\"\n\nAsked by The Intercept what she would do in the future when called to stand up to the oil and gas industry, Heitkamp refused to respond. When The Intercept asked her to describe her plans to address the climate crisis, an aide rapidly ushered her out of the building.\n\nLadonna Allard, on whose land the first DAPL resistance camp was built, observed the exchange. She was unsurprised, she said. \"I was really undecided about even coming, but when Heidi voted against Kavanaugh, I said OK.\" She added, \"Even though she did not support us when we needed her the most, right now she is the only choice at this moment. We must vote. We must show our power.\"\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "Trump's Pick to Manage Public Lands Has Four-Decade History of \"Overt Racism\" Toward Native People\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nWilliam Perry Pendley pushed rhetoric, legal arguments, and policies that sought to deprive Indigenous people of their rights.\n\nIn the five books authored by President Donald Trump's nominee to lead the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management, William Perry Pendley rails against \"environmental extremists,\" endangered species protections, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, and Al Gore - all of whom, in his view, would illicitly limit private development on the lands of the West. He had another target too: policies supporting Native nations' treaty rights.\n\nPendley has been the acting leader of the BLM, which is responsible for managing the nation's public lands, for more than a year. With confirmation hearings expected in the coming weeks, his long history of attacking Indigenous people is getting new scrutiny.\n\nFor years, Pendley was head of the Mountain States Legal Foundation, a right-wing organization that has fought multiple high-profile cases favoring private property rights in states west of the Mississippi, including in Native territories. In court and in his voluminous writings, Pendley attempted to undo protections for sites considered sacred to tribes; fought Justice Department efforts to support Native voters' rights; argued in favor of toppling key legal precedents that uphold treaty rights; and made statements about Native identity and religion that Indigenous scholars and attorneys call deeply offensive.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nIn his 2006 book \"Warriors for the West,\" for example, Pendley suggested that Native people may soon cease to exist. \"The day may soon come when Congress and the Supreme Court will be asked to take a serious and very hard look at whether there remains a need for the federal government's policy of paternalistic protection,\" Pendley wrote, apparently referring to the U.S. government's legal obligation to fulfill treaty commitments, known as its \" trust responsibility .\" The statement continued, chillingly, \"The day may come sooner than many expect given that, with ever-declining blood quantum per tribal member, recognized tribes may soon be little more than associations of financial convenience.\"\n\nPendley's views on Indigenous people have engendered fierce opposition to his nomination to lead BLM - with his positions on \"blood quantum\" being only the latest to come under scrutiny.\n\nJill Doerfler, a first-degree descendant of the White Earth Nation and professor of American Indian Studies at the University of Minnesota Duluth, has written extensively about \"blood quantum,\" a term meant to describe the proportion of \" Indian blood \" a person carries, used by some tribes as a prerequisite for citizenship. Doerfler's scholarship shows that blood quantum was imposed by European Americans attempting to diminish the number of tribal citizens able to access land. \"This seems like a long, old argument going back to the reason the federal government ever tried to push blood quantum as a way to identify American Indians. That has always been done as a way to access resources,\" she said. She added that the blood quantum has always been used \"to diminish the number of people that have that legal and political status as American Indians.\"\n\nMatthew Fletcher, director of the Indigenous Law and Policy Center at Michigan State University and member of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians, put it bluntly. \"That's just a crazy, crazy racist perception of what Indian people are and what tribes are,\" he said. \"Somebody who talks like that about people should not have a place in any public position in government. That is just overt racism.\"\n\nPendley, who has lately come under fire for his views on racial justice, worked for the Interior Department in the 1980s as well, and his record there provides further evidence that he could prioritize private development over treaty rights. As acting assistant secretary for energy and minerals under President Ronald Reagan in the early 1980s, Pendley sought to delay oil and gas industry royalty payments owed to Indigenous people, according to documents shared with The Intercept by the Western Values Project, a public lands and accountability nonprofit.\n\nNeither Pendley nor the Interior Department answered a detailed list of queries from The Intercept. \"Based on the misleading and accusatory questions sent by the Intercept, it is apparent your intention is to create the appearance of disagreement where none exists, and to smear the reputation of a public servant and former Marine who is one of the most highly qualified individuals ever to be considered for the position of BLM Director,\" said Conner Swanson, an Interior Department spokesperson, in an email. \"The Department looks forward to Mr. Pendley's swift confirmation.\"\n\nOf course, Pendley's critics are urging Senators to reject the attorney. \"William Pendley's record of actively working against the interests of Native Americans and tribal governments during the Reagan administration and while heading up the right-wing lawsuit factory Mountain States Legal Foundation should be as disqualifying as his racist and bigoted views,\" said Jayson O'Neill, director of the Western Values Project. Instead, given what O'Neill called the \" culture of corruption \" promoted by Trump and Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, \"They are actually trying to promote him.\"\n\nIn \"Warriors for the West,\" Pendley offers his version of the history of the European invasion of Indigenous lands. \"In the nation's early days, the United States sought to balance its 'Manifest Destiny' - to settle, colonize, and utilize the resources of the land - with the desires of the independent and diverse indigenous peoples who inhabited that land and used its resources and who wanted to keep both,\" Pendley wrote. \"The history of the federal government's treatment of American Indians has not involved overt, intentional racial hatred, but instead an attempt to achieve a Jeffersonian ideal of a United States of America in which all adopted the English language, Christian religion, and Anglo/American culture and lived side by side.\"\n\nPendley was omitting some details. \"In the mid-1800s to the early 1900s, our children were kidnapped and forced into mandatory military and religious run boarding schools - against their parents' will,\" said Angelique EagleWoman, co-director of the Indian Law Program at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law and a member of the Sisseton-Wahpeton (Dakota) Oyate. \"They were sexually, emotionally, and physically abused. If that isn't overt, intentional racism, I'm not sure what is. We have never fully received reparations or acknowledgement of that history.\"\n\nIt's not the only part of history Pendley might like to see left out. While Native tribes certainly suffered racist abuses, their relationships with the U.S. were actually established through and are still governed by nation-to-nation treaties, which carry constitutional weight as the \"supreme law of the land.\" The vast body of what is known as Indian law exists to support the United States' political - not racial - obligations to tribes, which came in return for the relinquishment of vast lands and resources.\n\nIn his book, Pendley acknowledges this history by citing the 1974 Supreme Court decision knowns as Morton v. Mancari, which affirms the U.S.'s obligations to Native people under the Constitution. But in legal documents, his monthly column, and book passages, Pendley has repeatedly and inaccurately argued that the decision supports unconstitutional racial preferences.\n\nPendley's push to overturn Mancari ties into his past efforts to disrupt racial justice programs. In the 1990s, Pendley was the attorney for a highway guardrail construction company that objected to a Department of Transportation program favoring \"socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.\" The case made its way to the Supreme Court, which in 1995 issued a ruling that severely curtailed affirmative action programs by imposing onerous burdens on racial preferences. In the wake of the decision, Pendley - again ignoring the weight of the treaties - repeatedly argued that \"Mancari is likely unconstitutional.\"\n\n\"This is fringe theory,\" said EagleWoman. \"Nothing that he's saying has gained any traction in the law.\"\n\nThat hasn't stopped right-wing legal groups from pushing the argument in court, including efforts by Pendley himself.\n\nIf Pendley and these groups are successful, the repercussions would be enormous. \"If Mancari were overturned, it would be an enormous legal and political disaster,\" said Robert Coulter, executive director of the Indian Law Resource Center and a member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation. \"Almost nothing would be the same. Around 200 years of congressional legislation would suddenly be unconstitutional and invalid.\"\n\n\"Some of the right-wing legal theories are like that,\" Coulter added. \"The aim is to create a disaster so that the legal framework as we know it would cease to exist, and Indian tribes would have virtually no rights.\"\n\nMancari isn't the only target of Pendley's attacks on Native rights. As a lawyer with Mountain States Legal Foundation and in his writing, he has argued against tribes and Native people in cases related to voting rights , tribal courts' jurisdiction , tribes' tax-exempt status, and the right of Indigenous people to speak their languages in the workplace. However, Pendley has perhaps most frequently argued to deny protections for sites considered sacred to Native tribes, including those located on and near public lands.\n\nPendley's approach is especially significant given that the Bureau of Land Management oversees 245 million acres of public lands - 12 percent of the United States - many of which border tribal land. Any pollution emitted by development projects could impact tribal citizens' health or the health of the wild flora and fauna on which they rely. Located on the land itself are numerous cultural resources, including sacred sites, that are important to Indigenous people's ways of life. Native American prayer ties are shown along the walking trail at Devils Tower National Monument in Devils Tower, Wyo. on July 9, 2015. Photo: Dan Cepeda/The Casper Star-Tribune via AP In February 1995, the National Park Service decided that Devils Tower, a butte in Wyoming, would be voluntarily off-limits to climbers every June, in order to respect area tribes' religious practices. Pendley was incensed and fought the policy in court . Despite the fact that several tribes continue spiritual practices at the site today, he claimed in a column that \"Devils Tower was never a sacred site for American Indians!\" As evidence, he noted that there were no \"sightings\" of American Indians at Devils Tower in the mid-to-late 1800s and pointed to a document from 1934 that claimed there was no \"physical evidence\" that the structure was important to people.\n\nNative American prayer ties are shown along the walking trail at Devils Tower National Monument in Devils Tower, Wyo. on July 9, 2015.\n\nMore recently, he represented a county defending the Trump administration's reduction in size of the Bears Ears National Monument, which is considered sacred to multiple tribes. And he fought against the Interior Department on behalf of the oil and gas company Solenex, which sought to drill in the pristine Badger-Two Medicine area of Montana, considered sacred to the Blackfeet people. (Pendley recused himself from work related to Bears Ears and involvement in the Solenex case after he came on as acting BLM head. A federal court upheld the cancellation of the energy company's lease in June.)\n\nAs a lawyer, Pendley also battled a decision by the Arizona Department of Transportation to refuse to buy rocks for highway projects from a company that mined the material from Woodruff Butte, considered sacred to the Hopi, Zuni, and Navajo people. And he opposed the federal government's decision to cancel a timber sale near Medicine Mountain and the Medicine Wheel, a national monument and a sacred site to Indigenous people, located in the Bighorn National Forest in Wyoming. Pendley represented a nearby sawmill that he claimed was prevented from purchasing the unharvested wood.\n\nIn his writings, Pendley frequently compared protections for sacred sites to legal cases barring Christian symbols in public spaces, like crosses removed from public property and prayers at public school. He claimed in \"Warriors for the West\" that \"the law of the land regarding government activity 'respecting an establishment of religion' is Judeo-Christian, 'no,' and pantheism, 'yes.'\"\n\nFletcher, the Indigenous law expert from Michigan State University, dismissed the idea that the federal government too frequently protects sacred sites. \"I would say that 95 percent of sacred sites cases that Indians or tribes bring, they lose,\" said Fletcher. \"The Devils Tower thing is particularly ridiculous. There is a voluntary climbing ban for one month in the summertime. There is no protection for Indian people on Devils Tower or really anywhere else.\" Proportionally, efforts to maintain Christian symbols in public spaces are more successful than cases to protect sacred sites \"by an incredible margin,\" he added.\n\nAt a hearing regarding the BLM's move to Colorado last September, Rep. Deb Haaland, D-N.M., asked Pendley about one of his dismissive statements about sacred sites. \"I was not speaking as a member of the BLM. I was speaking as a private attorney representing private clients,\" Pendley replied. \"I'm proud to speak on behalf of the Bureau of Land Management now, and I'm particularly pleased with the opportunities to work with the Bureau of Indian Affairs and tribes to establish tribal energy resource agreements to permit tribes to develop their energy resources.\"\n\n\"I have a new client,\" he claimed. \"My client's the American people.\"\n\nAt face value, Pendley could be seen as a natural ally to tribes and Native people that have sought to increase resource extraction on their lands. Yet he has even sided with energy companies against those very tribes interested in extractive development.\n\nLarge numbers of Native people rely on royalties paid by the oil and gas industry for extraction on their land. In many places, mining takes place on Native land that is held in trust by the federal government. Essentially, because of a long history of dispossession, the land is owned by a tribe or an American Indian person, but the federal government controls the leasing to ranchers, miners, or oil and gas companies. Royalties are then distributed by the federal government back to the tribal members who own the land. Many tribes and individuals plan their budgets with the royalties in mind and, for those living on razor-thin margins in economically depressed areas, they are an essential lifeline.\n\nFor decades leading up to the 1980s, oil and gas producers operating 21,000 leases located on land held in trust were required to pay Native owners their royalties within a month of production. But in 1983, while Pendley was serving as assistant secretary for energy and minerals in Reagan's Interior Department, his agency changed the policy, allowing the companies two months instead of one. Several people objected, mostly Comanche tribal members from the Anadarko area of Oklahoma, submitting a petition to the Bureau of Indian Affairs describing the hardship they would face if the change moved forward.\n\nRoyalty payments had already been delayed while the Minerals Management Service, which distributed royalty payments, updated its accounting system. \"We have suffered from non-payment of royalties for months. Many of us have lost our cars and other property while the government failed for months and months to collect or disburse millions of dollars in royalties belonging to us,\" the petitioners wrote. \"Now just as we are beginning to get some of these back royalties and pay our bills and living costs, the government proposes to cut off our royalties again.\"\n\n\"If you permit these new regulations our royalties will be cut off in the middle of winter,\" they continued. \"How will we pay for our food and housing and fuel? Do you think, Mr. Secretary, that our creditors are as lenient with us as you propose to be with the oil companies? No! Our mortgages and car payments are due every month. We must pay for our groceries when we buy them - not sixty to ninety days later.\"\n\nThe move was even opposed by other officials in Reagan's Interior Department. \"It will be very difficult to to explain this change satisfactorily to the Indian people,\" Ken Smith, a member of the Wasco Tribe of Oregon who was then serving as assistant secretary for Indian Affairs, wrote in a 1983 memo to Pendley. \"To suspend royalties for another month, probably in mid-winter, when change of regulations takes place, would work a tremendous hardship and create create a great deal of criticism.\"\n\nPendley declined to comment on whether he heeded the tribal members concerns. Current regulations indicate that royalty payments are due one month after the month of production.\n\nEchoes of Pendley's failure to properly consult with tribes during the Reagan era are already visible during his tenure as BLM's acting director. The area surrounding the Chaco Culture National Historical Park in New Mexico, for example, is considered sacred to many Indigenous people. As the region became a hotbed for Covid-19 cases in the U.S., Pendley's BLM was finalizing a resource management plan for the area. Rather than rescheduling public meetings regarding the plans, the bureau transferred them online, to take place while many of those most impacted were scrambling to manage the health emergency wreaking havoc on the community.\n\n\"Secretary Bernhardt and Acting Director Pendley are using this crisis to hand our public lands over to the oil and gas industry, and are silencing communities in the process,\" Rep. Raúl Grijalva, D-Ariz., said at the time in a statement . \"Native Americans are contracting and dying from coronavirus at an alarming rate, and the Trump administration should be working to make sure they have the resources they need to stop deaths, not keep drilling at record speed.\"\n\n\"Many folks near the Chaco region live in areas without internet access,\" Haaland added.  \"By moving forward, the Department is failing to fulfill its trust and treaty obligations to Native Americans, and it is failing to protect a national treasure.\"\n\nUltimately a public comment period was extended , but similar scenarios have played out throughout Native communities around the U.S.\n\n\"The BLM can and does have a big impact on tribes and tribal resources,\" said Coulter. \"It would be horrifying to see him really in charge.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Trump Says Native American Heritage Month Is Also for the White Men Who Stole Their Land\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nCommemorating the \"founders\" of America at the same time as Native Heritage Month adds insult to a long history of injury against Indigenous people.\n\nA woman performs a traditional Native American dance during the North American Indian Days celebration on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation in Browning, Mont., on July 13, 2018.\n\nSince 1990, the federal government has recognized November, albeit too quietly, as National Native American Heritage Month. Like most commemorative months dedicated to honoring the culture and history of an oppressed people in the U.S., Native American Heritage Month has always been a grossly insufficient gesture. So it was only added insult to an unbroken history of injury visited upon Indigenous people when President Donald Trump declared that November would also be \"National American History and Founders Month.\"\n\nThe White House issued a presidential proclamation at the end of last week to little fanfare. \"For more than two centuries, the American experiment in self-government has been the antithesis to tyranny,\" said the statement, a paean to nationalist myths. Trump did issue a presidential proclamation recognizing Native American Heritage Month on the same day, as he had in 2017 and 2018. Yet while the proclamation for Founders Month lives on WhiteHouse.gov, the statement recognizing Indigenous history is nowhere to be found on the site.\n\nPeople might point to the statement on Native American Heritage Month, but don't be fooled: The addition of a National American History and Founders Month - especially during the same timeframe - is cruel Indigenous erasure, pure and simple.\n\n\"Let me clarify,\" wrote journalist and Oglala tribe member Simon Moya-Smith on Twitter, \"Trump subverts and undermines #NativeAmericanHeritageMonth by instead celebrating 'The Founders' - white men who in the Declaration of Independence explicitly referred to Natives as 'merciless Indian savages.'\" Moya-Smith's invocation of this often overlooked racist piece of the Declaration of Independence raises a grim irony in Trump's new proclamation: It urges the \"indispensable\" study of \"our nation's founding documents\" in which this racist description of Indigenous people exists.\n\nThe proclamation is hardly Trump and his administration's first violence enacted against Native people. Just days into his presidency, Trump approved the completion of the Dakota Access pipeline, which Indigenous Water Protectors from around the country had been protesting against for years. The pipeline runs through sacred lands and threatens to contaminate the main water source of the Standing Rock Sioux, as well as 17 million people who live downstream from it.\n\nAnd Trump had mocked Sen. Elizabeth Warren - guilty of Native erasure herself - in a bigoted fashion by calling her \"Pocahontas\" and made a horrific reference to Wounded Knee , where over 250 Lakota were massacred and buried in a mass grave in 1890, in the process.\n\nIn the 1990s, Trump made moves to protect his own gambling empire from Native-owned casinos by secretly paying more than $1 million for ads that portrayed members of a tribe in upstate New York as cocaine traffickers and career criminals.\n\nThe National American History and Founders Month proclamation makes no mention of Native people, yet it states that \"we must develop a deeper understanding of our American story.\" Meanwhile, the buried Native American Heritage Month proclamation is in itself an offensive document. It praises the fact that Native Americans and Native Alaskans are more likely to serve in the armed forces than any other ethnic group in the U.S., yet unsurprisingly glosses over the way that these service members are treated in return . Native veterans are among the poorest in the country, the least insured, and with the least access to the Department of Veterans Affairs services.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism.

Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe Native Heritage statement also dedicates an entire paragraph to how the government has made efforts to address the opioid crisis, seizing \"more than 3,200 pounds of illegal narcotics with an estimated value of approximately $9 million.\"\n\nThe opioid crisis has indeed hit Native communities hard, leading to a spike in overdose deaths and hundreds of children being taken away from their parents and tribal communities by the state - reenacting a historic trauma of Native child removal in the U.S. In a White House statement ostensibly aimed at honoring Indigenous culture and history, the focus on the opioid epidemic - and to celebrate the state's response - is another insult.\n\n\"Native people are scientists, tribal leaders, educators, journalists, astronauts, activists, artists, actors, models, make-up artists and so much more,\" the Indigenous-focused news site Indian Country Today noted in a tweet about Native American Heritage Month.\n\nIt is crucial to add to this list that Indigenous people are at the forefront of the struggle against resource extraction and environmental decimation. This is at least one contribution by Native people that the Trump administration has recognized - and responded with militarized policing , brutality, and harsh legal penalties . It's an apt continuation of the legacy of American history and the founders. This history is not worthy of any kind of celebration at all.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Montana Tribes Hard-Hit by Covid-19 Brace for Republican Takeover\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nNative Americans in Montana are dying from Covid-19 at a rate 11 times higher than white residents.\n\nWhen Montana's Legislature met at the end of December to vote on whether visitors to the state Capitol building should have to wear masks, one lawmaker gave an impassioned plea.\n\n\"I have no stomach to talk about this abstractly; my community has been hit hard,\" said Sharon Stewart Peregoy, a Democratic state representative and member of the Crow Tribe. \"Even today, I just got a notification that another one has passed. It's real, folks. We should take the basic steps.\"\n\nA colleague called her words \"emotional\" and \"insulting.\"\n\n\"Science does lie. It depends on which science you are listening to. Different news channels have different scientists,\" said Republican Rep. Barry Usher. \"It's the facts.\"\n\nThe Legislature ultimately voted against a mandate along party lines, making mask-wearing optional in Montana's seat of government a month after the state experienced a Covid-19 surge that topped the charts globally.\n\nFor Indigenous communities, it was just the latest public health battle fought and lost during the pandemic.\n\n\"It's the intersection of highly vulnerable people going above and beyond and folks in rural communities who lean more conservative buying into all the garbage that it's 'embarrassing to wear a mask,'\" said state Sen. Shane Morigeau, a member of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes. \"I don't think the state leaders realize [the spread] is their fault - or they don't care, to be honest. It makes me tear up thinking about it.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nCovid-19 has killed Native Americans across the U.S. at nearly twice the rate of white people. But in Montana, Native Americans are dying from the disease at a rate 11 times higher than white residents. When Covid-19 raged through the High Plains this fall, making the state an international hot spot, tribes and reservations closed their businesses, imposed shutdowns, and introduced curfews. Intensive care units reached zero percent capacity, federally run hospitals on reservations were airlifting Covid-19 patients out, and neighboring states stopped being able to receive transfers. Overworked medical staff quit from the stress.\n\nThen-Gov. Steve Bullock, a Democrat, implemented a statewide mask mandate to mitigate the spread, but in many counties, including those bordering reservations, masks are still rejected and public health officials are ignored, putting Indigenous lives in the crosshairs. On January 4, Bullock was replaced by former U.S. Rep. Greg Gianforte, Montana's first Republican governor in 16 years, adding to concern among tribal leaders and public health experts that the pervasive anti-mask movement will soon become the law of the land.\n\nThe Rocky Mountains behind Polson, Mont., on Jan. 2, 2021.\n\nShelly Fyant's family lost three members to the Spanish flu of 1918 within the span of two days. When Covid-19 began spreading across the U.S., she didn't want the same thing to happen again. Fyant, chair of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribal Council, helped establish a Covid-19 unified command team in conjunction with neighboring Lake County, where tribal residents buy their food.\n\n\"Early on, I could see we were unified to a point,\" she said of the relationship. \"A month in, it started to deteriorate.\"\n\nThe tribes closed their Flathead Reservation in Montana's forested, mountainous West to nonresidents in late March but immediately faced a huge hurdle: The reservation is a checkerboard of land owned by both Native Americans and Montana locals who claimed property rights through homesteading in the 1800s. U.S. Route 93, which links Yellowstone and Glacier national parks, also cuts through the reservation. The tribe asked Lake County to agree to temporarily close the route, but county leaders refused.\n\nIn late April, when Bullock decided to reopen Montana but allowed local communities to enforce stricter rules, the tribe again asked Lake County to keep restrictions in place. The county punted. So when Fyant found out that a Fourth of July boat parade in support of President Donald Trump was scheduled in the nearby city of Polson on a lake that abuts the reservation, and that a restaurant called The Shoe was holding a barbecue equipped with \"three live bands,\" she had a hunch her concerns would go unheard.\n\n\"The city basically said, 'We're not the pandemic police,'\" she recalled.\n\nAlmost half of Lake County's Covid-19 cases are tribal, according to the county public health department. When photos emerged from the Independence Day event, it was clear just how little mask-wearing and social distancing had been implemented, but one person in particular stood out: a blond woman on a Jet Ski wearing a feather headdress, much like the Salish and Kootenai chiefs wear - some of their \"most sacred regalia,\" Fyant said. Tribal members viewed the act as a direct attack on their small community at a time when families were burying their loved ones in bursts.\n\n\"It was gut-wrenching,\" Fyant said, looking back. \"We have lost so many tribal members. ... Families upon families are suffering.\"\n\nLeft/Top: Angela Nicolai, a diabetes educator for the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribal Health Department, poses for a portrait in St. Ignatius, Mont., on Jan. 4, 2021. \"We see patients with health issues that could have lived for another 15 to 20 years if the virus hadn't come around,\" Nicolai said.

Native Americans make up just 7 percent of Montana's residents but have accounted for nearly 40 percent of the state's Covid-19 deaths. The disparity is largely due to the prevalence of underlying health conditions, such as diabetes, in Indigenous communities and the fact that many people lack access to running water and reside in multigenerational homes.\n\nAt least 183 Native Americans in Montana have died from the virus, and more than 8,000 have been infected.\n\n\"My dad had three of his best friends pass away within two weeks,\" said Kaci Wallette, a registered nurse and member of the Fort Peck Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes in northwest Montana. \"He just called me today to tell me he tested positive.\"\n\nHer dad's diabetes and age put him in a high-risk category.\n\n\"I try not to let it get me down,\" she said. \"It's a very sad time for our tribe.\"\n\nThere are 12 tribes spread across seven reservations in Montana, and many share borders with some of the fiercest anti-mask counties.\n\nIn Flathead County, north of the Flathead Reservation, a public health official quit her job after she said members of the county commission and city-county board of health were creating a \"toxic environment\" that focused on bolstering political views instead of locals' health.\n\n\"It's clear that the underlying motivation by several members of your groups is more closely aligned with ideological biases than the simple desire to do what's best for the health of the community,\" Interim Health Officer Tamalee St. James Robinson wrote in her resignation letter in early December.\n\nShe was the second person in six months to resign from the county's health board.\n\nBullock sued five businesses in Flathead in October over their failure to enforce his mask mandate, but a district judge threw out the case. Those businesses have since launched a countersuit against the state.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nIn Pondera County, next to the Blackfeet Reservation, all four members of the health department resigned in early November due to pushback from local leaders.\n\n\"In order to be successful, I need to be heard and invested in, the lines of communication need to be open, and frequent contact needs to be in place,\" Health Department Director Nicki Sullivan wrote when she quit. \"Hearing negative talk within the community about myself ... should be thwarted and never accepted.\"\n\nHealth experts in Lake County are facing similar resistance from local authorities. Emily Colomeda, Lake County health services director, said her team has been extremely limited in their ability to enforce the statewide mask mandate. County officials who do have the authority have not enforced the rule, she said, and businesses like The Shoe have taken advantage of the impasse.\n\n\"As health directors, we have no authority. We reached out to the environmental health department to look into it. We were met with resistance from the business, I have to say. The county attorney didn't want to enforce it,\" said Colomeda.\n\nCovid-19 cases in the county spiked following the July Fourth holiday weekend. Colomeda said a handful were traced back to the boat parade and dinner at The Shoe.\n\n\"We have a very small staff, four, and the tribe is also in the same county, so we share a population, basically,\" she said. \"It's a little frustrating that we are working overtime on weekends and evenings and that this is still happening.\"\n\nOn New Year's Eve, The Shoe held another bash that offered a four-course meal, live music, and dancing. But Colomeda's hands were tied.\n\n\"It came to the point where we just kind of gave up on that,\" she said. \"Obviously our efforts haven't been validated.\"\n\nPatrons walk into The Shoe, a restaurant in Polson, Mont., for New Year's Eve festivities on Dec. 31, 2020.\n\nWith limited state leadership on masks and infighting across counties, reservations have been left to go it alone to keep their populations safe from Covid-19.\n\n\"Those of us in public health, and especially anyone who's worked with Native communities, knew that when [Covid-19] came and hit, it would hit really hard,\" said Cora Neumann, a public health expert who supported the 2014 Ebola response in West Africa for the Global First Ladies Alliance, a partnership she founded with the offices of Laura Bush and Michelle Obama.\n\nNeumann is a public health adviser for Western Native Voice, a nonprofit that advocates for Native American communities. She's been leading online and in-person tutorials and debriefings with tribes on how to mitigate Covid-19 exposure and deal with the stigma surrounding getting sick. She brought in Beth Cameron, who previously headed the pandemic readiness office that Trump disbanded in 2018, to help draft the guidance.\n\nNeumann says tribes have been the true leaders during the pandemic, at times taking the strongest steps to curb the spread of the virus in Montana. But they are still the main victims of the disease.\n\n\"When you have the Crow or Northern Cheyenne or Blackfeet locking down and implementing stay-at-home orders for months on end, but the surrounding counties don't abide, that's the problem,\" she said. \"And who gets sick? The Native Americans get sick.\"\n\nBut it's not as simple as staying away from those counties.

When we go in there, we're probably the only ones that wear masks around. ... We just go there as quickly as we can and get out,\" said Susan Webber, a state senator and member of the Blackfeet tribe. \"Only the Indians are wearing masks.\"\n\nThe risk of exposure is glaring. In November, the Blackfeet hosted a digital memorial service honoring 27 members who died from Covid-19.\n\nWebber has served in the Legislature for eight years and lived on the reservation her entire life. Tensions between the reservation and surrounding towns have always been tough. She says she's been a victim of the \"lazy Indian\" stereotype, recalling an instance in a supermarket where another shopper incorrectly scolded her for \"being on welfare.\"\n\n\"Native Americans are the largest minority in Montana. So we're the only ones visible. We're the dark people,\" she said. \"Until the Trump administration, it used to be kind of covert. Now it's overt.\"\n\n\"As an Indian in Montana, you live with discrimination all the time,\" she added. Choosing where to go based on who follows the mask guidelines is just another hurdle for her daily routine.\n\nWebber and others are concerned that Bullock's successor, Gianforte, won't help bridge the state's divide on pandemic policies. Gianforte, who was charged with assault for attacking a reporter during his 2018 congressional run, has been criticized for speaking at the Let Freedom Ring concert in October, which officials said violated health guidelines. The concert was linked to multiple Covid-19 cases. He has also promoted the idea of herd immunity as an effective approach to the pandemic.\n\nIn a letter to the state Legislature, Gianforte said his office would be taking \"commonsense, precautionary\" measures and encouraging visitors to wear masks. He said he will wear one in the Capitol building but has not committed to continuing Bullock's mandate, which required all counties to enforce mask-wearing regardless of active case counts. Gianforte is the only elected governor to take the reins for the first time during the pandemic. He did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"I generally believe in personal responsibility rather than mandates,\" he told a local TV station in December. \"I think Montanans will do the right thing when presented with the facts.\"\n\nMany remain skeptical.\n\n\"In past administrations, when we didn't have Democratic representation, we've seen a little more strained relationships with tribes,\" said state Sen. Morigeau, of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes. \"Gianforte, he won, and he deserves the chance to prove me wrong and prove otherwise.\"\n\nWebber, meanwhile, said she wouldn't stick around the Capitol building long enough when the Legislature convened in early January to see whether Gianforte stuck to his mask promise.\n\n\"It has the potential of being a superspreader event. We are locked in this one Capitol building for 90 days. About 250 staff. About 200 lobbyists and then every person who wants to testify for a bill comes from every part of Montana.\"\n\n\"As soon as I swear in, I'm leaving,\" she said. \"I can't take any chances of bringing this back home.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Native American Activist Critical of Elizabeth Warren Says Her Speech Was a \"Step in the Right Direction\"\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nOne prominent critic of Warren's claimed Native American heritage is heartened by her remarks at a recent Native American forum.\n\nElizabeth Warren used her recent address at the National Congress of American Indians to address long-standing criticisms of her claims of Native American heritage.\n\n\"You won't find my family members on any rolls, and I'm not enrolled in a tribe,\" she said, conceding that there are no tribal records of her family belonging to the Cherokee. \"And I want to make something clear. I respect that distinction. I understand that tribal membership is determined by tribes - and only by tribes. I never used my family tree to get a break or get ahead. I never used it to advance my career.\"\n\nBut she also insisted that she does have part Native American lineage. \"But my mother's family was part Native American. And my daddy's parents were bitterly opposed to their relationship,\" she said. \"So, in 1932, when Mother was 19 and Daddy had just turned 20, they eloped.\"\n\nShe used the rest of the speech to highlight issues important to Native populations, such as economic deprivation, environmental degradation, and stopping interpersonal violence against Native peoples.\n\nHer speech was applauded by at least two critics of Warren's claim of Native heritage.\n\nRebecca Nagle is a citizen of the Cherokee Nation who works on domestic violence issues, as well as other activism. Last year, she wrote an op-ed for ThinkProgress that was critical of the Massachusetts senator. \"She is not a hero because, despite claiming to be the only Native woman in the U.S. Senate, she has done nothing to advance our rights,\" she wrote.\n\nIn an interview with The Intercept, Nagle gave Warren credit for addressing issues important to Native Americans. \"I would say overall I think that this speech was a step in the right direction,\" she said, \"and I hope that she continues to walk in that direction. I also hope that people [will] hold her accountable in that direction.\"\n\nThe activist appreciated how Warren focused on the underlying issues in the community, rather than simply focusing on herself. \"I think her reframing the conversation and instead of centering herself, centering Native people, was a really good step in the right direction. I also think that the other thing she did that was positive was making a clear commitment to prioritize Native issues,\" she said. \"I think we'll have to watch and see if she makes good on that promise. But I think that commitment is a good step in the right direction. And also clearly building relationships with Native leaders.\"\n\nNagle would, however, encourage Warren to simply withdraw her claim of being of Native heritage. \"I think that's an area where she has more steps to take,\" she said. \"I think [her remarks were] a step in the right direction, and it almost seems like she is saving the hardest part for last, which was admitting that she was wrong. ... I actually think there's a lot of opportunity for Warren to be a public example of that. I would totally have nothing but respect for her if she was able to publicly come out and say, 'I was told these stories as a child, I grew up with them, I believed them most of my life, but I've learned more, not only about Native identity, but also my family, and have learned that they're not based in reality. And that I can't claim these things.' I would have a lot of respect for her. And I have a little bit of hope that that might happen.\"\n\nTom Bonier, meanwhile, had been quoted in a Boston Globe article, predating her speech, suggesting Warren apologize for her claim. Bonier had been asked specifically to respond to Nagle's column. Bonier is the CEO of TargetSmart, a data firm that does the bulk of its political work with the Democratic National Committee, having been paid $1.05 million just this cycle .\n\nXochitl Hinojosa, communications director for the DNC, distanced the organization from the comments when they first appeared. \"TargetSmart does not do polling for the DNC, they do not lead strategy for the DNC, and they do not speak for the DNC,\" she told The Intercept. \"Elizabeth Warren has been a tireless champion in the Senate for the American people and any suggestion otherwise is ludicrous.\"\n\nNow that Warren is leaning into her heritage, Bonier applauded the approach. \"I loved her speech. I loved how she addressed it all head-on. I'm interested to see how leaders in various Native American communities respond,\" he told The Intercept. \"And to be clear, when I spoke with the reporter, she told me that it had been proven that Warren had no Native American heritage. So I appreciate that Warren addressed that head-on as well.\"\n\nOn the night of Warren's speech, she also mingled with conference-goers at a private cocktail reception, and delivered a truncated version of the message, which was well received, said Deb Haaland, an enrolled member of Laguna Pueblo, who is running in a New Mexico district.\n\nUpdate: Feb. 16, 2018\n\nThis story was updated to include Warren's speech at a private event following her speech.\n\nTop photo: From left, Piscataway scholar Gabrielle Tayac with Rebecca Nagle of the Cherokee Nation; Jeremiah Lowery, a candidate for D.C.

      "text": "Elizabeth Warren Reveals DNA Evidence of Native American Ancestry, Replying to Trump's Taunts\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren took a DNA test which suggests that she has some Native American ancestry, and she made sure Donald Trump knew all about it.\n\nIn a direct response to President Donald Trump's taunts, Sen. Elizabeth Warren revealed on Monday that a DNA test provides compelling evidence that she does, in fact, have Native American ancestry.\n\nWarren announced the test results in a highly produced biographical video that looks like the opening salvo in a campaign against Trump for the presidency, which the Massachusetts senator said last month she would \"take a hard look at\" pursuing after her likely re-election in November.\n\nThe video, which points to a new section of the Massachusetts Democrat's website dedicated to facts about her heritage , begins with images of the senator returning to meet her brothers in Norman, Oklahoma, where she was raised, as audio of Trump mocking her as a \"fake Pocahontas\" rings out on the soundtrack.\n\nClips of Trump and other Republicans deriding Warren for what they assumed was her false claim about her Native ancestry are interwoven with the senator and her brothers recounting family lore about Native roots , which appears to trace their ancestry back to a great-great-great-grandmother , O.C. Sarah Smith, once described as Cherokee.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nWarren is then shown getting the test results from Carlos Bustamante , a professor of biomedical data science, genetics, and biology at Stanford University, who has advised the genetic testing services Ancestry.com and 23andMe, as well as the PBS series \" Finding Your Roots .\"\n\n\"The president likes to call my mom a liar,\" Warren tells Bustamante. \"What do the facts say?\"\n\n\"The facts suggest that you absolutely have a Native American ancestor in your pedigree,\" Bustamante replies.\n\n\"In the senator's genome,\" Bustamante explains to the video crew, \"we did find five segments of Native American ancestry with very high confidence, where we believe the error rate is less than 1 in a 1,000.\"\n\nA copy of the full report from Bustamante's lab, posted online by the Boston Globe, makes it clear that the \"identity of the sample donor, Elizabeth Warren, was not known to the analyst during the time the work was performed.\"\n\n\"My family (including Fox News-watchers) sat together and talked about what they think of @realDonaldTrump's attacks on our heritage,\" Warren wrote on Twitter Monday morning. \"And yes, a famous geneticist analyzed my DNA and concluded that it contains Native American ancestry.\"\n\nThe video also sets out to debunk the false claim that Warren had gained a professional advantage in her previous career as a law professor by identifying herself as part Native American. A series of law school administrators and professors who took part in her hiring repeatedly dismiss that claim as nonsense. Last month, the group spoke to the Boston Globe, which was given access to Warren's personnel files, for a debunking of the falsehood .\n\nWarren also pointed to that evidence on Twitter, in a thread encouraging readers to \"review every document for yourself.\"\n\nI never expected my family's story to be used as a racist political joke, but I don't take any fight lying down. I want you to have the power to fight lies with the truth, so here's a new site for you to review every document for yourself. https://t.co/900SsAMNjb\n\n- Elizabeth Warren (@ewarren) October 15, 2018\n\nNews of the DNA test, and the video, was first provided by Warren's office to the Boston Globe reporter Annie Linskey, who described it as evidence that the senator, if she runs for president, \"plans to be a very different candidate than Hillary Clinton was.\"\n\n\"The 2016 Democratic nominee for president,\" Linskey wrote , \"chafed at releasing personal information and was dogged throughout her campaign by her use of a private server while she was secretary of state.\"\n\nThe campaign-style video, raising and debunking attacks on her, could also be seen as evidence that Warren has learned the lessons of another failed Democratic nominee: John Kerry, who refused to aggressively confront false claims about his service in Vietnam that were raised by an outside group, Swift Boat Veterans for Truth, in 2004.\n\nLinskey's report, which features a more extensive interview with Bustamante, notes that the genetic expert estimated that Warren's Native American ancestor appears in her family tree \"in the range of 6-10 generations ago.\" That would seem to fit the story that Warren's parents told their children about their maternal great-great-great-grandmother.\n\nHowever, the Boston Globe report could also point to ways the story might soon be attacked by Warren's political opponents, as they seek to cast doubt on the results. Bustamante was careful to say that his lab is \"confident it is not an error\" to say Warren has Native American ancestry, but the imprecision of genetic testing will no doubt soon be a subject of national debate should the senator run for president.\n\nAs Linskey explains, Bustamante was also forced to use a creative method to identify Native American genetic material, which could give Trump supporters an opportunity to dispute the findings:\n\nDetecting DNA for Native Americans is particularly tricky because there is an absence of Native American DNA available for comparison. This is in part because Native American leaders have asked tribal members not to participate in genetic databases.\n\n\"The tribes have felt they have been exploited,\" explained Lawrence Brody, a senior investigator with the Medical Genomics and Metabolic Genetics Branch at the National Institutes of Health. \"The amount of genetic data that is available from Native Americans is sparse.\"\n\nTo make up for the dearth of Native American DNA, Bustamante used samples from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia to stand in for Native American. That's because scientists believe that the groups Americans refer to as Native American came to this land via the Bering Straight about 12,000 years ago and settled in what's now America but also migrated further south. His report explained that the use of reference populations whose genetic material has been fully sequenced was designed \"for maximal accuracy.\"\n\nBustamante said he can tease out the markers that these South Americans would have in common with Native Americans on the North American continent.\n\nDespite a total lack of evidence, Trump's attacks on Warren have already convinced millions of his supporters that she somehow gained an unfair advantage through the affirmative action programs they despise. If Warren declares her candidacy in the months ahead, expect to hear a lot about the fact that Bustamante's lauded work on genetics has focused, in part, on what his lab's website describes as \"broadening representation of understudied groups, particularly U.S. minority populations and those from Latin America\" and \"calling attention to the problem raised by >95% of participants in large-scale studies being of European descent.\"\n\nQuite apart from the implications for electoral politics, the news of Warren's DNA test struck several Native American observers as problematic for the assumptions about identity, race and belonging that it revealed.\n\nUsing a DNA test to prove \"race\" is pure racist and eugenicist garbage. ?\n\n- Nick Estes (@nickwestes) October 15, 2018\n\nLast winter @SenWarren made a beautiful address to @NCAI1944 to rebuke some of the awful, racist things @realDonaldTrump said about Natives. That was an important step, acknowledging Trump insulted NATIVE people, not her.\n\nThis spectacle put the focus squarely back on her tho.\n\n- Gyasi Ross (@BigIndianGyasi) October 15, 2018\n\nhaving to respond to settler infighting takes up too much of Indigenous people's time.\n\n- Kim TallBear (@KimTallBear) October 15, 2018\n\noh fun! waking up to the first media inquiry of the day on #elizabethwarren . she's like michael myers. no matter the weapon, this story WILL NOT DIE. i tweeted everything i had to say in june 2016. here's the wakelet if you missed it. https://t.co/xz6l7e3O54\n\n- Kim TallBear (@KimTallBear) October 15, 2018\n\nYes AND White ppl claiming to be Native when they are not is the result of the same violent, colonial system. #Warren is the latter not the former. https://t.co/I5YtM8K35I\n\n- Rebecca Nagle (@rebeccanagle) October 15, 2018\n\nWarren's claim to Native American identity based on such remote ancestry has prompted criticism from other activists in the past.\n\nAs news of the test results spread on Monday, Warren also reminded Trump of his promise at a rally on July 5 that he would donate $1 million to a charity of her choice if she took a DNA test that supported her claim to Native American ancestry.\n\nBy the way, @realDonaldTrump : Remember saying on 7/5 that you'd give $1M to a charity of my choice if my DNA showed Native American ancestry?

      "text": "A Short History of Americans Praising Their Own \"Generosity,\" From the Genocide of Native Americans to Trump's Child Snatchers\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nU.S. leaders have a telling tic: Whenever they talk about being \"generous\" to a group of people, it means they are beating the hell out of them.\n\nEarlier this week , Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar celebrated the Trump administration for its treatment of immigrant children it has separated from their parents. \"We have nothing to hide about how we operate these facilities,\" said Azar on CNN. \"It is one of the great acts of American generosity and charity, what we are doing for these unaccompanied kids.\"\n\nThis magnanimous claim raises an obvious question: What are the other great acts of American generosity?\n\nOf course, we know that the U.S. treatment of Native Americans has been extraordinarily generous. They were literally asking for it since before there was an America: The seal of the Massachusetts Bay Colony for most of the 17th century was an Indian saying, \"Come over and help us.\"\n\nSo as President Andrew Jackson explained to Congress in 1829 when making the case for the Indian Removal Act, \"Toward the aborigines of the country no one can indulge a more friendly feeling than myself. ... Rightly considered, the policy of the General Government toward the red man is not only liberal, but generous .\" The passage of the act the next year generously allowed the Cherokee to experience the Trail of Tears.\n\nSixty years later, in \" The Winning of the West ,\" future President Teddy Roosevelt remained impressed by this example of American generosity. \"In [our] treaties,\" he wrote, \"we have been more than just to the Indians; we have been abundantly generous . ... No other conquering and colonizing nation has ever treated the original savage owners of the soil with such generosity as has the United States.\"\n\nSlavery, too, was an act of generosity. As Thomas Roderick Dew, who went on to become president of William & Mary College, put it in the famed 1832 treatise, \"The Pro-Slavery Argument,\" slaveowners were among the \" most generous \" Americans. Moreover, a slaveholder's son, precisely because he witnessed his father enslaving others, \"acquires a greater generosity and elevation of soul, and embraces for the sphere of his generous actions a much wider field.\"\n\nThe Vietnam War was another high point in U.S. generosity. David Lawrence, then editor of U.S. News & World Report, proclaimed in 1966 that \"what the United States is doing in Vietnam is the most significant example of philanthropy extended by one people to another that we have witnessed in our times.\"\n\nMore recently, we generously helped three prisoners at Guantánamo Bay kill themselves. \"The manipulative detainees,\" wrote Michelle Malkin soon afterward, \"reportedly used the generous civil liberties protections we gave them to plot their suicide pact.\"\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nSo we clearly have a long history about which to volubly praise ourselves. But we should be modest enough to realize that we have never matched the moral heights of the most generous man in history: Adolf Hitler.\n\nJust before the German invasion of Poland in 1939, the British ambassador to Germany wrote home to explain how frustrated Hitler was that he was not receiving credit for his generosity:\n\nHerr Hitler replied that he would be willing to negotiate, if there was a Polish Government which was prepared to be reasonable. ... He expatiated on misdoings of the Poles, referred to his generous offer of March last, said that it could not be repeated.\n\nWe shouldn't feel too bad about the Poles' ingratitude, however. Hitler had an advantage, because he was leading the Germans, who are naturally generous to a fault. Joseph Goebbels explained this in a generous 1941 article, titled \" The Jews Are Guilty! \":\n\nIf we Germans have a fateful flaw in our national character, it is forgetfulness. This failing speaks well of our human decency and generosity , but not always for our political wisdom or intelligence. We think everyone else is as good natured as we are.\n\nAt this point, all we can do is pray that someday we will find it in our hearts to be as generous as 1940s-era Germans. Overall, we're still a long way from that achievement, but certainly there seem to be some pioneers among us right now who are getting close.\n\nTop photo: U.S. Border Patrol agents arrive to detain a group of Central American asylum-seekers near the U.S.-Mexico border on June 12, 2018 in McAllen, Texas.\n\nWAIT!

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nSouthampton, New York, is the famed summer retreat of billionaires and celebrities. A two-hour drive east from New York City, mansions line its picturesque beaches and luxury vehicles parade its streets. But just outside of town, a Native American group has been staging a month-long occupation for their tribe's economic empowerment. The protest ends today, on the Native American National Day of Mourning, when millions will be celebrating Thanksgiving.\n\nThe Sovereignty Camp 2020 is set across the Sunrise Highway from a 61-foot tall electronic billboard featuring the Shinnecock Indian Nation seal. Down the side, ads for NYU Langone Health flash in brilliant technicolor. Recently, it also featured public safety messages from Southampton Town related to COVID-19 - ad space the Nation gave free of charge . The highway, which cuts through dense woods, doesn't have lights or any other billboards, making this one a jarring sight at night. The Nation is planning to build another sign at the campsite, but the state of New York is fighting them in court.\n\nTo the moguls nearby, the billboards are an assault on their idyllic way of life - one they are trying to tear down. To the Shinnecock, the signs are monuments asserting their continued existence in the face of generational oppression. The billboards are also about immediate survival: When completed, the structures should generate millions in desperately needed revenue for the Nation from advertisers eager for visual promotion in a spot promising maximum visibility to an affluent audience.\n\nThe conflict spotlights not merely one local property battle, but the ongoing displacement of indigenous peoples from their own tribal lands. It is a parable affiliated in popular culture with South America and the western United States - and now it is playing out in the vacation hideaway of the wealthiest and most powerful people on the planet.\n\nThe Shinnecock are one of 13 tribes indigenous to Long Island - and the only one with federal recognition, which they secured in 2010. Their original territory ranged about 146 square miles - from current day Eastport to East Hampton; from Peconic Bay to the Atlantic Ocean. Since their first encounter with English settlers in 1640, their holdings have been diminished to less than 1,000 acres.\n\nThere are 1,550 Shinnecock alive today - many of them descendants of enslaved natives and Africans. About half of that population lives on a 1.3 square mile reservation that borders Southampton. The Rez, as it is called by locals, accounts for most of Shinnecock tribal holdings and is stricken with poverty.\n\nMeanwhile, about 100 yards from the Rez is Meadow Lane, also known as \"Billionaire Lane.\" This seaside road is home to the exclusive Meadow Club of Southampton as well as designer Calvin Klein, KKR & Co. co-founder Henry Kravis, hedge fund mogul Daniel Och, and Apollo Global Management co-founder Leon Black. In February, a home on Meadow Lane sold for $41 million . An 8-minute drive from The Rez is Coopers Neck Lane, ranked by Zillow as the 8th richest street in America in 2015, with a median home value of $11.8 million.\n\nFrom the start, the Town of Southampton and New York State sought to stop the project before it ever got off the ground. The battle has received widespread media attention, even making an appearance on The Daily Show, which took out an ad on the billboard that read, \"Relax and enjoy your stolen land.\"\n\nAfter several stop-work orders and a cease and desist were ignored , the New York Attorney General's office filed suit in 2019 on behalf of the state's Department of Transportation seeking to remove the completed structure and prevent construction of the second sign. The suit alleges that the Nation did not seek proper permitting, that there are safety concerns for highway drivers, and that the Westwoods is not Shinnecock land. In May, a New York State lower court judge denied the state's request for a preliminary injunction to remove the monument, but the battle is far from over.\n\nMeanwhile, residents from the surrounding community circulated a petition on Change.org demanding the removal of the billboard - and the controversy has driven advertisers away , depriving the tribe of desperately needed revenue.\n\n\"As residents of the Town of Southampton, we enjoy the beauty of our town and take great pride in our environment, which offers lush woods, beautiful waterways and the quaint communities in which we live,\" the petition read. \"But the large illuminated billboards that are being erected on Sunrise Highway threaten to damage our cherished way of life.\"\n\nThe ongoing battle prompted the Warriors of the Sunrise , a Shinnecock-led activist group dedicated to the Nation's economic development, to organize the 26-day Sovereignty Camp. The protesters argue that the site of the monument billboards, a territory known as the Westwoods, is Shinnecock land and thus New York State's lawsuit represents an unlawful incursion on the Nation's sovereignty. The Nation shares this position. The encampment also has the support of groups like The Long Island Progressive Coalition, Cooperation LI, and both the Nassau County and Suffolk County Democratic Socialists of America.\n\n\"Monuments can tell a story, and that's exactly what this is,\" said Tela Troge, spokesperson for the Warriors and a tribal attorney. \"It's a monument to the Shinnecock Nation and it's a monument to the Nation's continued existence.\"\n\nSouthampton town Supervisor Jay Schneiderman told the Daily Poster that while he did object to the billboards when they first went up, believing them to be \"out of character for the area\" - a sentiment he still holds - the town was not standing in the way of their construction or operation.\n\n\"Large illuminated digital advertising displays are more typical of urban areas,\" Schneiderman wrote in an email. \"However, I respect the Nation's desire for income to help address social and economic issues on the reservation. The town has not blocked the operation of the billboard or the construction of the second billboard. [New York] State believes that the billboards violate federal highway law.\"\n\nSchneiderman declined to say whether or not he felt the state's lawsuit ought to continue.\n\nAt the heart of the state lawsuit is a 300-year-old land dispute over territory known as Shinnecock Hills, which separates the billboard monument sites - also contested land - from the reservation itself.\n\nThe Hills was Shinnecock territory for thousands of years before settlers first arrived and \" purchased \" land from the natives to establish Southampton in exchange for 16 coats, 60 bushels of corn, and protection from other tribes. The partition involved two dubious transactions in 1703 and 1859. In the first, the Shinnecock relinquished ownership of the Hills and Shinnecock Neck to the town in exchange for a 1,000-year lease. In the second, the state legislature approved a transfer of the Hills to the town's proprietors in exchange for the Shinnecock reclaiming absolute ownership of the Neck - a move that reduced tribal holdings to less than 1,000 acres.\n\nIn his book \"Colonizing Southampton,\" the late David Goddard, a retired sociology professor at the City University of New York, noted that the Shinnecock had rejected similar offers from the town multiple times over the years, but faced mounting pressure in the form of continued encroachments on the land by the settlers and costly lawsuits.\n\nThere are also lingering questions about the signatures on the petition submitted to the legislature by the town. Around 1885, a dozen Shinnecock tribal members signed an affidavit alleging the signatures had been forged. Compounding those problems, Congress never authorized the exchange as required by The Federal Non‐Intercourse Act of 1790, which prohibits states and local governments from engaging in land transactions with Native American tribes without federal approval.\n\nEfforts to reclaim the land by the Nation have thus far been unsuccessful. A 2005 suit against New York State ended a decade later with an unfavorable ruling from the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals that remuneration would be too \" disruptive \" to the non-Native communities. The decision had been the latest in a string of similar rulings by the 2nd Circuit against tribes seeking to reclaim their ancestral territories. Still, the tides may be turning nationally. Over the summer, the Supreme Court ruled that much of the State of Oklahoma was situated on tribal land for the purposes of jurisdiction.\n\nThe partition of the Shinnecock Hills may affect the outcome of the current litigation over the Westwoods billboard monuments.\n\nIn his May decision preventing removal of the existing sign, New York State Supreme Court Judge Sanford Neil Berland wrote that \"not only is it undisputed that the Nation owns the land in question, but there is no doubt that the Nation has owned it for many decades, if not centuries, predating most, if not all, significant development in the area.\"\n\nBut in its amended complaint filed the next month, the state argued that actually the Westwoods \"is separate and apart from the Shinnecock Indian Reservation\" - an argument only made possible by the partition - and \"is not aboriginal or sovereign lands.\"\n\nContested land ownership has hindered Shinnecock efforts to develop economically. In 2007, plans for a casino and bingo hall in Hampton Bays on a Westwoods parcel fell through after the town sued and a federal judge ruled that the nation had lost aboriginal title to the Westwoods during colonial times.\n\nAt the time, the Shinnecock tribe was not federally recognized despite applying in 1978, and that lack of recognition presented a serious hurdle to its efforts. However, with the nation's federal recognition in 2010, the outlook has changed. This past September, the nation announced that not only had the U.S. National Indian Gaming Commission approved its tribal gaming ordinance, but it had partnered with Native American gaming chain Seminole Hard Rock Entertainment and developer Tri-State Partners on plans for another casino.\n\nBut those plans are a ways off and The Rez is in desperate need now.\n\n\"Right now, [the billboard monument] is literally the only revenue that we have and it doesn't even meet our minimum basic needs,\" Warriors spokesperson Troge explained. \"We are seriously struggling.\"\n\nShe acknowledged that the situation is far from ideal in that the nation must rely on revenue from some of the same forces driving commercialization and development on the east end. The billboard has featured advertisements for Rolex, BMW, and other luxury brands.\n\n\"Everything about all of this is perverse,\" she said.\n\nBut the reality is, 60 percent of The Rez's population live below the poverty line according to the last census. Data compiled by TownCharts reveals that over half of the population earns less than $15,000 annually. Food insecurity, lack of basic supplies, and inadequate housing are persistent problems.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has compounded the situation. The Shinnecock had to bar outsiders from their annual Labor Day Powwow at the Rez, which normally draws thousands and represents a substantial revenue source for the Nation. While Native Americans are disproportionately affected by the pandemic, the Shinnecock have been remarkably successful at containing the virus. Still, Troge said there has been a recent outbreak on The Rez linked to early voting, which could spell disaster.\n\n\"There's a vast unmet need for a housing fund,\" she said. \"We have a situation where a lot of people on The Rez live in multigenerational households. Sometimes you have three or four generations living in one house so it's almost impossible to quarantine from vulnerable members of your family.\"\n\nTo her point, The Rez has a larger average household size than the rest of the state and the country as a whole, and 33 percent of families rely on a single earner.\n\n\"To make things worse, most houses have serious structural deficiencies,\" she said. \"Some lack plumbing, some lack heating, and it's this widespread problem because we're completely cut off from accessing any type of traditional capital that people would use for housing. Like, we can't get mortgages, we can't get home equity lines. So basically how people are building houses is like, you have to like, basically put away money from your paycheck each week or you have to max out your credit cards.\"\n\nTroge noted that there are tribal members who will be spending this winter living in tents on The Rez - and some who won't even have that luxury.\n\nSchneiderman, the Southampton town supervisor, told the Daily Poster that he has been working to secure a grant \"to address some of the housing issues affecting a few of the elders living on the Reservation.\" He also noted that he has supported \"many of the Shinnecock Nation's economic development initiatives, including the medical marijuana dispensary and the gas station.\"\n\nAsked about reparations, he cautioned that \"the town would not be the proper party to discuss this. It would have to be at a federal level.\"\n\nTroge told the Daily Poster that economic development is part of a debt owed to the Shinnecock. Currently, economic development projects like the billboard account for 30 percent of the tribal government's budget.\n\nIn the 400 years since they encountered settlers, the Shinnecock have faced genocide - outright enslavement and indentured servitude, decimation from foreign diseases like smallpox, forced assimilation through though Indian schools like the notorious Thomas Indian School of Eerie, New York and the Carlisle Indian School . That legacy of violence continues today through not only economic neglect, but continued encroachment and cultural desecration.\n\nIn 2018, a construction crew unearthed an ancient burial site while digging a foundation for a new development in the Shinnecock Hills, complete with skeletal remains and artifacts. While the Shinnecock long for their ancestors' graves to be left in peace, there was little they could do to prevent the excavation, and the remains were removed from the site.\n\nIn September, the Southampton town board, after months of protest from tribal members, unanimously adopted the Graves Protection Act and placed a moratorium on construction in parts of the Shinnecock Hills. The move earned praise from Shinnecock Nation Chairman Bryan Polite who said it marked \"a new brighter chapter in the three-hundred-and-eighty-year relationship between the Town of Southampton and the Shinnecock Nation.\"\n\nIn our correspondence, Schneiderman called the act \"landmark legislation.\" But Rebecca Genia, a longtime Shinnecock activist and member of the Warriors, said the town's actions were \"watered-down\" and took way too much work.\n\n\"For decades, we've been pleading with them to adopt these laws and keep the bulldozers out of our sacred hills,\" she said, explaining that the the moratorium came \"finally with more pressure, more public people, more allies coming together to email the town board, to call them to text them, to have personal conversations with them. We had a demonstration in January of 2020. It was freezing cold out there but 150 people showed up to stop the desecration of the Shinnecock Hills.\"\n\nGenia expressed doubt that much will change even with the moratorium in place. She noted that despite the protesters' efforts, one home was still allowed to be constructed.\n\nTroge said that the construction in the Hills has not stopped even now.\n\n\"They keep building. It's horrible. It's horrible to watch,\" she said. \"We've actively been there watching as they're taking our ancestors' skulls out of the ground.\"\n\nTroge said a justification often given for removal is that the remains could be from victims of MS-13 related gang violence. She said the desecrations are alarmingly common and necessitate \"repatriation ceremonies\" wherein the Nation repossesses the remains that have been removed, and buries them as close as possible to their original resting places. According to Genia, in the previous year alone, the Shinnecock have conducted over one hundred such ceremonies.\n\n\"I can't explain the toll that it takes on you,\" Troge added, describing having been in attendance.\n\nThe largest gravesite desecration happened in 1891 with the construction of the Shinnecock Hills Golf Club - the same Club that hosted the 2018 U.S. Open, an event from which the Shinnecock did not benefit financially except for being allowed to charge visitors for parking on their land. Untold numbers of gravesites were excavated during construction of the course. As there were no protocols for dealing with ancient remains, Genia explained, many of the bones ended up in trash cans, in people's attics, or were swept into the golf course's bunkers.\n\n\"These billionaires build their mansions on stolen land,\" Genia said, \"and play golf on our cemeteries.\"\n\nYou can subscribe to David Sirota's investigative journalism project, the Daily Poster , here .\n\nWalker Bragman is a journalist and JD whose work has been featured in Paste Magazine , the Intercept , HuffPost , the Independent , Salon , Truthout , and the Hill .\n\nMark Colangelo is a New York-based independent journalist.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nGone are the days when a historian like Howard Zinn could simply point out that the Europeans exploited, plundered, and enslaved Native Americans in their quest for gold, spices, and a connection to Asia.\n\nNow, many popular accounts insist that what happened is more complicated. They argue that environments, diseases, and technology - rather than the expansionist avarice of Columbus and his band of rapacious explorers - should be singled out as key causes of American Indians' extermination. And when they do introduce human agency into their analyses, it's often on behalf of elite actors.\n\nIn Jared Diamond's Pulitzer Prize-winning Guns, Germs, and Steel , for example, environmental factors are elevated to the \"ultimate causation\" in explaining why Columbus and other Europeans swept across the continent.\n\nDiamond never asks why the initial meetings between Europeans and Native Americans led to violence and enslavement. Assuming that encounters between two distinct groups of people inevitably produce conflict, he instead concentrates on the types of crops, animals, and resources geographically available to Eurasian populations (as opposed to American and African populations). Based on the former's advantages, he argues that a kind of egalitarian imperialism obtained: any group of people who began in Eurasia would, in the long run, have fared far better and likely dominated any other group of people that began in non-Eurasia.\n\nTo be fair, Diamond's book does attack the purported role of biological determinism in shaping historical events. Yet it still refuses to view human beings as political subjects, treating them instead as agents of environmental prophecy. Where the invasion of Columbus was concerned, the political motivations of the people involved apparently had no bearing.\n\nA similar tendency is at work in journalist Charles Mann's 2005 book 1491 , which tells a story about Native Americans molding the environments in which they lived. While his intention is to show that the civilizations of the Americas were far more advanced than popularly imagined, Mann is even more forceful in his rejection of moral complicity for the violence and destruction Europeans soon carried out.\n\nExamining the demographic data, Mann concludes that the rate of coincidental death - via diseases the Europeans could not control - far exceeded the rate of death via deliberate violence. \"How can they,\" Mann asks, \"be culpable for it [the deaths of hundreds of thousands]?\"\n\nDiamond and Mann are part of a wave of writers who embraced environment- and disease-related explanations precisely when historians concluded that the written record had confirmed the deplorable misdeeds of Columbus and his confederates.\n\nFor these contrarians, 1492 marked the beginning of an age where groups of people across the world began to create a global world-system. Or at least their ruling classes did. The old narrative of conquest, violence, and atrocity was thus transformed into a story where elites made modernity, the popular struggles waged against them receding into the background.\n\nChanging perceptions about Native American societies played an interesting role in the development of this globalization narrative.\n\nUntil the mid-twentieth century, the lack of interest in Native American history helped perpetuate myths about indigenous society and culture as a romantic Eden, subsequently corrupted by the sins of Europe.\n\nYet indigenous societies were quite stratified - especially those of the Aztecs and Incans. Far from egalitarian paradises, such societies had a clear elite class that exploited subordinate groups.\n\nThe myths about a Native American Eden came less from the writings of people living in 1492 and more from naturalists, philosophers, and scientists of the nineteenth century, who painted a blissful image of the \"Indian\" as ineluctably in tune with nature, lost to those who were \"civilized.\"\n\nBut as that rosy view began to crumble, uglier depictions took its place. Now some historians describe the Aztecs as a \" culture obsessed with death .\" Even more astute historians mistake the grotesque actions and behaviors of the elite ruling class as representative of Native American societies as a whole.\n\nAt the same time, crusading Spaniards are increasingly offered apologetics, or even hailed for their ostensible benevolence.\n\nThe chief example is Bartolomé de las Casas - \"Defender of the Indies.\" While de las Casas freed his slaves - and dedicated nearly half a century to fighting for Native Americans in the courts of Valladolid, Barcelona, and Seville - he kept his critiques of colonial endeavors confined to violent outbreaks. He still clung to a belief in Christian authority, whose supremacy Native Americans challenged when they asked why crosses came at the barrels of guns. Even the historian most responsible for our current knowledge and study of Las Casas - Lewis Hanke - saw the Bishop as representing the more benevolent elements of Hispanic conquest.\n\nWhether or not the Spanish monarchy was in favor of providing good treatment for their vassals, it is clear the enforcement of such treatment was not a high priority. The only time the Crown contested abuses and atrocities in the Caribbean - and later New Spain - was when they coincided with larger struggles of authority over an increasingly restless American Spanish elite.\n\nIn short, rather than supplying a more nuanced view of Spanish conquest, the revival of Las Casas's intellectual writings has conveniently obscured questions of actual brutality.\n\nSo if the prevailing narrative is lacking, what's a more accurate depiction?\n\nLet me offer a counter-synthesis: in 1492, Christopher Columbus sailed across the Caribbean, intending to land in the richest part of Asia. Mistakenly believing he had accomplished his task, Columbus reported back that it was only a matter of time before the Crown could collect on its investment.\n\nOn his return journey, Columbus brought back six Native American slaves, ushering in a network of Native American slavery throughout the Spanish world (and replicating what Europeans had done on the Mediterranean for centuries).\n\nRealizing that the Spaniards intended to establish a permanent presence and brutally exploit them, Native American groups like the Taíno and the Caribs fought back , joined by African slaves brought to the Caribbean. The failure to find gold in Hispaniola, compounded by mounting debt and an increasingly scarce supply of food, drove the colonists to desperation. And Native Americans paid the price. While diseases exacerbated the number of casualties, the primary cause of death for Native Americans, especially between 1492 and 1550, was enslavement, famine, and exhaustion .\n\nThis might have been the end of the story: a failure to colonize the Caribbean. But Hernan Cortés, in defiance of Cuban governor Diego Velázquez, sailed from the Caribbean to Veracruz, where he docked - and subsequently sank - the ships that had brought his crew. With only one way forward, Cortés' group, flanked and subsumed by an independent Tlaxcalan army, invaded Tenochtitlan. The heart of the Aztec Empire fell to Spanish rule.\n\nMore than likely, Aztec and Incan societies were themselves predicated on social stratification between elite and commoner classes, with the former paying the latter in taxes and tribute. Such a structure was largely co-opted by the Spaniards, who became the system's ultimate benefactors.\n\nWhile directly connecting this moment to the development of a world-system of capital is difficult , the violent struggle between Spanish and English conquistadors and intellectuals undoubtedly sustained the countries in their wars on the European continent. What's more, this exploitation gave Europe the time and space it needed to finally catch up with regions like China and pull ahead of Native cities like Tenochtitlan and Cuzco. The cost, however, was millions of Native American lives and an expansive and racialized slavery regime the likes of which the world had never seen.\n\nParts of this narrative are debatable; it is not meant to be the story of the Americas. But it is a narrative that is debatable in human terms, with political stakes. Disease, environments, and technology are part of the story, but each requires a particular political will to be potent aspects.\n\nIt is a narrative of moral culpability, and political motivations. And if it bears on modern political discussions, it does so only when we ask what decisions humans make to help or hurt one another.\n\nSo happy Columbus Day.

Dorothy Sullivan\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nTwo hundred and twenty-two years ago today, in a field near what's now Greenville, Ohio, a preacher named John Rhys delivered an Independence Day address to the United States Army.\n\nThe troops in his audience had recently won a decisive victory over the Western Confederacy , an alliance of Native peoples who'd been battling white encroachment in the Midwest for a decade. That victory had brought to an end the first Indian war of the federal era. More than a thousand white Americans had been killed, and perhaps twice that number of Native Americans.\n\nNative leaders expected that defeat would mean a permanent expulsion from their lands. But Reverend Rhys took a different line. \"The love of conquest and enlargement of territory should be sacrificed,\" he told the troops. \"Whites and Indians should move to each other's towns, get to know each other better, perhaps even fall in love.\" When they recognized their mutual humanity, he insisted, they would become \"one people, and have but one interest at heart.\"\n\nIt's easy to see the relationship between white people and Native Americans in early US history as a zero-sum game: the United States gave national form to a practice of settler colonialism that had marginalized Native people for centuries; the interests of white settlers who pushed forward into Indian country after 1776 were fundamentally opposed to those of Native Americans.\n\nAnd in their broad outline, these assumptions are correct. From George Washington to Andrew Jackson (and beyond), America's presidents had little regard for the wellbeing of Native people. But Rhys's Independence Day oration points to a very different outcome, free of mass murder and terror.\n\nJohn Morgan Rhys wasn't the lone voice calling for integration. In fact, the idea that Native Americans and white people should live together in a single nation was the formal policy of the US government from the 1790s through the 1820s. The dispossession and removal of Native Americans in the first fifty or sixty years of the United States wasn't driven solely by racism. It happened despite the insistence of many powerful voices - from presidents to bureaucrats to authors to clergymen - that coexistence and perhaps even integration were possible.\n\nWhat happened, then, to this parallel vision? Why weren't the principles of Rhys's oration put into practice?\n\nIt was the United States' very first secretary of war, Henry Knox , who realized that simply wiping out Native people might present a problem to the young nation.\n\nKnox, who'd been a bookseller in Boston before he became a general in the American Revolution, fancied himself a man of the Enlightenment. His reading of natural history, especially the work of the French scientist Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon , had assured him that \"race\" had no basis in science: the bewildering diversity of human appearance and behavior was entirely due to social and physical climate. Humanity was plastic, and individuals could be \"improved\" if subjected to the right environment and influences.\n\nThis perspective was anathema to white settlers on the frontier, who insisted that Native people would block the course of progress unless they were killed or removed. But Knox told Washington in 1789 that the settlers' view was \"more convenient than just.\" If placed in the correct circumstances, Knox assured the president, Native Americans could be just as \"civilized\" as white people.\n\nKnox's embrace of a \"liberal\" Indian policy was also influenced by his reading of history. Every educated American knew about the ravages the Spanish had visited on the peoples of the Caribbean and Latin America after 1492. It was a \"melancholy reflection,\" Knox wrote in 1794, \"that our modes of population have been more destructive to the Indian natives than the conduct of the conquerors of Mexico and Peru.\"\n\nKnox was talking here about the effective extirpation of Native people from the Eastern Seaboard during the century and a half before the American Revolution.\n\nHe reassured himself that \"the present government of the United States cannot with propriety be involved in the opprobrium,\" but he knew that a wave of Indian wars could quickly bring the new United States into disrepute. European nations would lose faith in America's lofty boasts about liberty and equality if it destroyed its indigenous population, and the \"future historian\" would write about the founding years of the United States \"in sable colors.\"\n\nTo save its honor in the present and its reputation in the future, Knox suggested a simple prescription: the United States had to \"tranquilize the frontiers.\"\n\nIn the decades following the federal republic's founding in 1789, numerous politicians and federal officials offered variations on the same theme. But the frontiers were anything but tranquilized: major Indian wars erupted in a broad arc from what's now the Midwest to central Georgia.\n\nThree major obstacles prevented Knox and his colleagues from realizing their \"enlightened\" visions for Native Americans. The first was very basic: federal officials, intellectuals, and reformers were clustered in the towns and cities of the East, hundreds of miles from the conflict zone between white settlers and Indians. Settlers were numerous, tenacious, and not minded to accept the \"liberal\" pieties of the coastal elite.\n\nSettlers, as Knox accurately reported to George Washington, had \"imbibed the strongest prejudices against the Indians.\" Federal officials told each other that the white population at the frontiers needed \"civilizing\" in much the same way as the Native one, especially on the issue of coexistence between the races.\n\nThe problem of controlling a distant battle between settlers and Indians was compounded by the federal government's limited reach. During the first decades of the republic, the US army - like the entire federal government - was a small operation. To wage war with anyone, especially the Indians, required the careful coopting of local people to fight in a popular cause. It was easy to recruit militia members in western Pennsylvania or Kentucky or Georgia to fight Native Americans; it was harder to persuade them to fight their fellow settlers.\n\nSince white settlers were also powerfully represented in state governments, the early federal bureaucracy faced an additional layer of opposition as it attempted to impose its \"civilizing\" policy on the states.\n\nIn what's now the Midwest, federal officials ruled directly via the territorial governments that Thomas Jefferson's Northwest Ordinance had created in 1787. In the Southeast, on the other hand, federal officials found themselves quarreling with state officials from Georgia or South Carolina who were openly contemptuous of the nostrums of Knox and Washington.\n\nWhile it's hard to imagine now, Washington and his successors fretted that angry settlers or state officials might throw in their lot with the Spanish and British empires that adjoined the nascent United States. And yet settler intransigence towards Native territory made a nonsense of federal rhetoric about Native rights.\n\nBy 1796, Washington had become so exasperated at his inability to restrain settlers that he reached for an extreme solution: couldn't the federal government build a wall on the border to keep white people and Indians from fighting each other? Clearly those were more liberal times, because he didn't suggest making Native peoples pay for it. But the idea was no more practical in the 1790s than in our current political moment. Turning ideology into political reality was harder than Washington had first imagined.\n\nThe second obstacle to integrating the Native and white population was harder for Henry Knox and his colleagues to see. Although Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Knox, and others offered lavish paeans to Native potential, their view of human \"improvement\" was entirely one-directional: whites had nothing to learn from Indians, while Native people had everything to learn from whites.\n\nThat Native nations might have found independent routes to \"civilized\" precepts, or might have preferred their own values to \"civilized\" ones, was anathema to the central premise of Native uplift.\n\nHence the confusion that faced American military commanders when they marched to Native villages in the Ohio country and discovered that, in fact, Indian nations had settled houses and substantial agriculture; or the bafflement of US government agents toward the Cherokees and the Creeks, who struggled to understand the matrilineal (and often matriarchal) dynamics of Native society.\n\nIn 1793, when dozens of Indian leaders met a group of US negotiators on the southern shores of Lake Erie, the Native emissaries professed their sympathy for white settlers: \"We know that these settlers are poor, or they would have never ventured to live in a country which has been in continual trouble ever since they crossed the Ohio.\" Offering their own version of benevolence, the Indians suggested that the federal government spend its money on resettling these poorer whites in the towns of the East, rather than \"raising and paying armies with a view to force us to yield to you our country.\"\n\nBut the \"enlightened\" men who developed early US Indian policy weren't only limited by what they couldn't understand. In the final analysis, they were unwilling to pay the price that their high-minded visions required.\n\nIn the case of territorial expansion, the United States government used acquisitions of western land both to pay off the revolutionary war debt and to enrich individuals with close ties to the government. (Many of the Founders were land speculators.) Henry Knox and Thomas Jefferson convinced themselves that accelerating land transfers from Native people to whites would speed up the \"civilizing\" process - with less territory in which to hunt game, they argued, Native Americans would rush to embrace the hoe and the Bible.\n\nAgainst mounting evidence that this convenient calculus was false, they pushed ahead regardless. Jefferson was especially culpable in this, instructing officials to extend credit at government-controlled trading posts in the hope of using Native debt to force yet more land sales. When another huge Indian uprising erupted in the Midwest during James Madison's first administration, it owed a great deal to the inconsistencies and outright hypocrisies of Jefferson, Madison's predecessor.\n\nJefferson, like many national politicians between 1790 and 1820, insisted that the tensions on the frontier would ultimately be resolved through intermarriage between whites and Indians. \"You will mix with us by marriage,\" Jefferson told a visiting delegation of Delawares and Mohicans in 1808. \"Your blood will run in our veins, and will spread with us over this great island.\"\n\nSetting aside for a moment that Jefferson was never able to use his personal experience of racial amalgamation to achieve progressive political ends, it's hard to see how he expected to deliver on these lavish promises of a mixed-race future.\n\nBetween 1789 and 1830, federal officials did nothing to create the conditions in which white settlers and Native Americans might see each other as having shared interests. Worse, Eastern elites were inclined to imagine that the work of amalgamating the populations might be easily delegated to western settlers who were, in their view, a good deal more like the Indians than they were.\n\nWhen William Crawford, secretary of war, reminded white Americans in 1816 that intermarriage was the endgame of US Indian policy, a Virginia newspaper offered this reassurance to its readers: \"Mr Crawford does not propose to unite our city beaux with the unpolished, untutored rough Indian squaws. There is a hardy, laborious race of woodsmen, forming the intermediate link.\"\n\nBeneath their commitment to \"enlightened\" values, the political and moral visionaries of the early United States found it depressingly easy to conclude that the work of integration was somebody else's responsibility.\n\nToday, the history of US Indian policy in the country's early years rarely enters the news cycle. The one recent exception is President Trump's repeated embrace of Andrew Jackson, whose portrait the president installed in the Oval Office and whom Trump adviser Steve Bannon has favorably compared to his boss.\n\nCritics have rightly reminded us that America's seventh president crafted a lethal policy toward Native Americans. It was Jackson, after all, who pushed for the passage of the Indian Removal Act of 1830 , triggering a wave of ethnic cleansing that largely extinguished the Native presence east of the Mississippi River.\n\nBut the first six men in the White House, all of whom saw themselves as \"enlightened\" in ways that Jackson most surely was not, created the landscape of racial injustice that Jackson ruthlessly reordered.\n\nOn the Fourth of July 1795, John Rhys told the US army at Greenville that the truly benevolent American should be \"every person's neighbor: the white, the black, and the red, are alike to him.\" The Founders heard Rhys' call, but proved unwilling or unable to pay the price of coexistence.\n\nNicholas Guyatt teaches American history at the University of Cambridge.

Now it's the scene of an indigenous struggle for justice and survival.\n\nProtesters outside Mike Bloomberg's house in Southampton on July 1, 2020.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nSouthampton, New York, is the famed summer retreat of billionaires and celebrities. A two-hour drive east from New York City, mansions line its picturesque beaches and luxury vehicles parade its streets. But just outside of town, a Native American group has been staging a month-long occupation for their tribe's economic empowerment. The protest ends today, on the Native American National Day of Mourning, when millions will be celebrating Thanksgiving.\n\nThe Sovereignty Camp 2020 is set across the Sunrise Highway from a 61-foot tall electronic billboard featuring the Shinnecock Indian Nation seal. Down the side, ads for NYU Langone Health flash in brilliant technicolor. Recently, it also featured public safety messages from Southampton Town related to COVID-19 - ad space the Nation gave free of charge . The highway, which cuts through dense woods, doesn't have lights or any other billboards, making this one a jarring sight at night. The Nation is planning to build another sign at the campsite, but the state of New York is fighting them in court.\n\nTo the moguls nearby, the billboards are an assault on their idyllic way of life - one they are trying to tear down. To the Shinnecock, the signs are monuments asserting their continued existence in the face of generational oppression. The billboards are also about immediate survival: When completed, the structures should generate millions in desperately needed revenue for the Nation from advertisers eager for visual promotion in a spot promising maximum visibility to an affluent audience.\n\nThe conflict spotlights not merely one local property battle, but the ongoing displacement of indigenous peoples from their own tribal lands. It is a parable affiliated in popular culture with South America and the western United States - and now it is playing out in the vacation hideaway of the wealthiest and most powerful people on the planet.\n\nThe Shinnecock are one of 13 tribes indigenous to Long Island - and the only one with federal recognition, which they secured in 2010. Their original territory ranged about 146 square miles - from current day Eastport to East Hampton; from Peconic Bay to the Atlantic Ocean. Since their first encounter with English settlers in 1640, their holdings have been diminished to less than 1,000 acres.\n\nThere are 1,550 Shinnecock alive today - many of them descendants of enslaved natives and Africans. About half of that population lives on a 1.3 square mile reservation that borders Southampton. The Rez, as it is called by locals, accounts for most of Shinnecock tribal holdings and is stricken with poverty.\n\nMeanwhile, about 100 yards from the Rez is Meadow Lane, also known as \"Billionaire Lane.\" This seaside road is home to the exclusive Meadow Club of Southampton as well as designer Calvin Klein, KKR & Co. co-founder Henry Kravis, hedge fund mogul Daniel Och, and Apollo Global Management co-founder Leon Black. In February, a home on Meadow Lane sold for $41 million . An 8-minute drive from The Rez is Coopers Neck Lane, ranked by Zillow as the 8th richest street in America in 2015, with a median home value of $11.8 million.\n\nFrom the start, the Town of Southampton and New York State sought to stop the project before it ever got off the ground. The battle has received widespread media attention, even making an appearance on The Daily Show, which took out an ad on the billboard that read, \"Relax and enjoy your stolen land.\"\n\nAfter several stop-work orders and a cease and desist were ignored , the New York Attorney General's office filed suit in 2019 on behalf of the state's Department of Transportation seeking to remove the completed structure and prevent construction of the second sign. The suit alleges that the Nation did not seek proper permitting, that there are safety concerns for highway drivers, and that the Westwoods is not Shinnecock land. In May, a New York State lower court judge denied the state's request for a preliminary injunction to remove the monument, but the battle is far from over.\n\nMeanwhile, residents from the surrounding community circulated a petition on Change.org demanding the removal of the billboard - and the controversy has driven advertisers away , depriving the tribe of desperately needed revenue.\n\n\"As residents of the Town of Southampton, we enjoy the beauty of our town and take great pride in our environment, which offers lush woods, beautiful waterways and the quaint communities in which we live,\" the petition read. \"But the large illuminated billboards that are being erected on Sunrise Highway threaten to damage our cherished way of life.\"\n\nThe ongoing battle prompted the Warriors of the Sunrise , a Shinnecock-led activist group dedicated to the Nation's economic development, to organize the 26-day Sovereignty Camp. The protesters argue that the site of the monument billboards, a territory known as the Westwoods, is Shinnecock land and thus New York State's lawsuit represents an unlawful incursion on the Nation's sovereignty. The Nation shares this position. The encampment also has the support of groups like The Long Island Progressive Coalition, Cooperation LI, and both the Nassau County and Suffolk County Democratic Socialists of America.\n\n\"Monuments can tell a story, and that's exactly what this is,\" said Tela Troge, spokesperson for the Warriors and a tribal attorney. \"It's a monument to the Shinnecock Nation and it's a monument to the Nation's continued existence.\"\n\nSouthampton town Supervisor Jay Schneiderman told the Daily Poster that while he did object to the billboards when they first went up, believing them to be \"out of character for the area\" - a sentiment he still holds - the town was not standing in the way of their construction or operation.\n\n\"Large illuminated digital advertising displays are more typical of urban areas,\" Schneiderman wrote in an email. \"However, I respect the Nation's desire for income to help address social and economic issues on the reservation. The town has not blocked the operation of the billboard or the construction of the second billboard. [New York] State believes that the billboards violate federal highway law.\"\n\nSchneiderman declined to say whether or not he felt the state's lawsuit ought to continue.\n\nAt the heart of the state lawsuit is a 300-year-old land dispute over territory known as Shinnecock Hills, which separates the billboard monument sites - also contested land - from the reservation itself.\n\nThe Hills was Shinnecock territory for thousands of years before settlers first arrived and \" purchased \" land from the natives to establish Southampton in exchange for 16 coats, 60 bushels of corn, and protection from other tribes. The partition involved two dubious transactions in 1703 and 1859. In the first, the Shinnecock relinquished ownership of the Hills and Shinnecock Neck to the town in exchange for a 1,000-year lease. In the second, the state legislature approved a transfer of the Hills to the town's proprietors in exchange for the Shinnecock reclaiming absolute ownership of the Neck - a move that reduced tribal holdings to less than 1,000 acres.\n\nIn his book \"Colonizing Southampton,\" the late David Goddard, a retired sociology professor at the City University of New York, noted that the Shinnecock had rejected similar offers from the town multiple times over the years, but faced mounting pressure in the form of continued encroachments on the land by the settlers and costly lawsuits.\n\nThere are also lingering questions about the signatures on the petition submitted to the legislature by the town. Around 1885, a dozen Shinnecock tribal members signed an affidavit alleging the signatures had been forged. Compounding those problems, Congress never authorized the exchange as required by The Federal Non‐Intercourse Act of 1790, which prohibits states and local governments from engaging in land transactions with Native American tribes without federal approval.\n\nEfforts to reclaim the land by the Nation have thus far been unsuccessful. A 2005 suit against New York State ended a decade later with an unfavorable ruling from the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals that remuneration would be too \" disruptive \" to the non-Native communities. The decision had been the latest in a string of similar rulings by the 2nd Circuit against tribes seeking to reclaim their ancestral territories. Still, the tides may be turning nationally. Over the summer, the Supreme Court ruled that much of the State of Oklahoma was situated on tribal land for the purposes of jurisdiction.\n\nThe partition of the Shinnecock Hills may affect the outcome of the current litigation over the Westwoods billboard monuments.\n\nIn his May decision preventing removal of the existing sign, New York State Supreme Court Judge Sanford Neil Berland wrote that \"not only is it undisputed that the Nation owns the land in question, but there is no doubt that the Nation has owned it for many decades, if not centuries, predating most, if not all, significant development in the area.\"\n\nBut in its amended complaint filed the next month, the state argued that actually the Westwoods \"is separate and apart from the Shinnecock Indian Reservation\" - an argument only made possible by the partition - and \"is not aboriginal or sovereign lands.\"\n\nContested land ownership has hindered Shinnecock efforts to develop economically. In 2007, plans for a casino and bingo hall in Hampton Bays on a Westwoods parcel fell through after the town sued and a federal judge ruled that the nation had lost aboriginal title to the Westwoods during colonial times.\n\nAt the time, the Shinnecock tribe was not federally recognized despite applying in 1978, and that lack of recognition presented a serious hurdle to its efforts. However, with the nation's federal recognition in 2010, the outlook has changed. This past September, the nation announced that not only had the U.S. National Indian Gaming Commission approved its tribal gaming ordinance, but it had partnered with Native American gaming chain Seminole Hard Rock Entertainment and developer Tri-State Partners on plans for another casino.\n\nBut those plans are a ways off and The Rez is in desperate need now.\n\n\"Right now, [the billboard monument] is literally the only revenue that we have and it doesn't even meet our minimum basic needs,\" Warriors spokesperson Troge explained. \"We are seriously struggling.\"\n\nShe acknowledged that the situation is far from ideal in that the nation must rely on revenue from some of the same forces driving commercialization and development on the east end. The billboard has featured advertisements for Rolex, BMW, and other luxury brands.\n\n\"Everything about all of this is perverse,\" she said.\n\nBut the reality is, 60 percent of The Rez's population live below the poverty line according to the last census. Data compiled by TownCharts reveals that over half of the population earns less than $15,000 annually. Food insecurity, lack of basic supplies, and inadequate housing are persistent problems.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has compounded the situation. The Shinnecock had to bar outsiders from their annual Labor Day Powwow at the Rez, which normally draws thousands and represents a substantial revenue source for the Nation. While Native Americans are disproportionately affected by the pandemic, the Shinnecock have been remarkably successful at containing the virus. Still, Troge said there has been a recent outbreak on The Rez linked to early voting, which could spell disaster.\n\n\"There's a vast unmet need for a housing fund,\" she said. \"We have a situation where a lot of people on The Rez live in multigenerational households. Sometimes you have three or four generations living in one house so it's almost impossible to quarantine from vulnerable members of your family.\"\n\nTo her point, The Rez has a larger average household size than the rest of the state and the country as a whole, and 33 percent of families rely on a single earner.\n\n\"To make things worse, most houses have serious structural deficiencies,\" she said. \"Some lack plumbing, some lack heating, and it's this widespread problem because we're completely cut off from accessing any type of traditional capital that people would use for housing. Like, we can't get mortgages, we can't get home equity lines. So basically how people are building houses is like, you have to like, basically put away money from your paycheck each week or you have to max out your credit cards.\"\n\nTroge noted that there are tribal members who will be spending this winter living in tents on The Rez - and some who won't even have that luxury.\n\nSchneiderman, the Southampton town supervisor, told the Daily Poster that he has been working to secure a grant \"to address some of the housing issues affecting a few of the elders living on the Reservation.\" He also noted that he has supported \"many of the Shinnecock Nation's economic development initiatives, including the medical marijuana dispensary and the gas station.\"\n\nAsked about reparations, he cautioned that \"the town would not be the proper party to discuss this. It would have to be at a federal level.\"\n\nTroge told the Daily Poster that economic development is part of a debt owed to the Shinnecock. Currently, economic development projects like the billboard account for 30 percent of the tribal government's budget.\n\nIn the 400 years since they encountered settlers, the Shinnecock have faced genocide - outright enslavement and indentured servitude, decimation from foreign diseases like smallpox, forced assimilation through though Indian schools like the notorious Thomas Indian School of Eerie, New York and the Carlisle Indian School . That legacy of violence continues today through not only economic neglect, but continued encroachment and cultural desecration.\n\nIn 2018, a construction crew unearthed an ancient burial site while digging a foundation for a new development in the Shinnecock Hills, complete with skeletal remains and artifacts. While the Shinnecock long for their ancestors' graves to be left in peace, there was little they could do to prevent the excavation, and the remains were removed from the site.\n\nIn September, the Southampton town board, after months of protest from tribal members, unanimously adopted the Graves Protection Act and placed a moratorium on construction in parts of the Shinnecock Hills. The move earned praise from Shinnecock Nation Chairman Bryan Polite who said it marked \"a new brighter chapter in the three-hundred-and-eighty-year relationship between the Town of Southampton and the Shinnecock Nation.\"\n\nIn our correspondence, Schneiderman called the act \"landmark legislation.\" But Rebecca Genia, a longtime Shinnecock activist and member of the Warriors, said the town's actions were \"watered-down\" and took way too much work.\n\n\"For decades, we've been pleading with them to adopt these laws and keep the bulldozers out of our sacred hills,\" she said, explaining that the the moratorium came \"finally with more pressure, more public people, more allies coming together to email the town board, to call them to text them, to have personal conversations with them. We had a demonstration in January of 2020. It was freezing cold out there but 150 people showed up to stop the desecration of the Shinnecock Hills.\"\n\nGenia expressed doubt that much will change even with the moratorium in place. She noted that despite the protesters' efforts, one home was still allowed to be constructed.\n\nTroge said that the construction in the Hills has not stopped even now.\n\n\"They keep building. It's horrible. It's horrible to watch,\" she said. \"We've actively been there watching as they're taking our ancestors' skulls out of the ground.\"\n\nTroge said a justification often given for removal is that the remains could be from victims of MS-13 related gang violence. She said the desecrations are alarmingly common and necessitate \"repatriation ceremonies\" wherein the Nation repossesses the remains that have been removed, and buries them as close as possible to their original resting places. According to Genia, in the previous year alone, the Shinnecock have conducted over one hundred such ceremonies.\n\n\"I can't explain the toll that it takes on you,\" Troge added, describing having been in attendance.\n\nThe largest gravesite desecration happened in 1891 with the construction of the Shinnecock Hills Golf Club - the same Club that hosted the 2018 U.S. Open, an event from which the Shinnecock did not benefit financially except for being allowed to charge visitors for parking on their land. Untold numbers of gravesites were excavated during construction of the course. As there were no protocols for dealing with ancient remains, Genia explained, many of the bones ended up in trash cans, in people's attics, or were swept into the golf course's bunkers.\n\n\"These billionaires build their mansions on stolen land,\" Genia said, \"and play golf on our cemeteries.\"\n\nYou can subscribe to David Sirota's investigative journalism project, the Daily Poster , here .\n\nWalker Bragman is a journalist and JD whose work has been featured in Paste Magazine , the Intercept , HuffPost , the Independent , Salon , Truthout , and the Hill .\n\nMark Colangelo is a New York-based independent journalist.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nGone are the days when a historian like Howard Zinn could simply point out that the Europeans exploited, plundered, and enslaved Native Americans in their quest for gold, spices, and a connection to Asia.\n\nNow, many popular accounts insist that what happened is more complicated. They argue that environments, diseases, and technology - rather than the expansionist avarice of Columbus and his band of rapacious explorers - should be singled out as key causes of American Indians' extermination. And when they do introduce human agency into their analyses, it's often on behalf of elite actors.\n\nIn Jared Diamond's Pulitzer Prize-winning Guns, Germs, and Steel , for example, environmental factors are elevated to the \"ultimate causation\" in explaining why Columbus and other Europeans swept across the continent.\n\nDiamond never asks why the initial meetings between Europeans and Native Americans led to violence and enslavement. Assuming that encounters between two distinct groups of people inevitably produce conflict, he instead concentrates on the types of crops, animals, and resources geographically available to Eurasian populations (as opposed to American and African populations). Based on the former's advantages, he argues that a kind of egalitarian imperialism obtained: any group of people who began in Eurasia would, in the long run, have fared far better and likely dominated any other group of people that began in non-Eurasia.\n\nTo be fair, Diamond's book does attack the purported role of biological determinism in shaping historical events. Yet it still refuses to view human beings as political subjects, treating them instead as agents of environmental prophecy. Where the invasion of Columbus was concerned, the political motivations of the people involved apparently had no bearing.\n\nA similar tendency is at work in journalist Charles Mann's 2005 book 1491 , which tells a story about Native Americans molding the environments in which they lived. While his intention is to show that the civilizations of the Americas were far more advanced than popularly imagined, Mann is even more forceful in his rejection of moral complicity for the violence and destruction Europeans soon carried out.\n\nExamining the demographic data, Mann concludes that the rate of coincidental death - via diseases the Europeans could not control - far exceeded the rate of death via deliberate violence. \"How can they,\" Mann asks, \"be culpable for it [the deaths of hundreds of thousands]?\"\n\nDiamond and Mann are part of a wave of writers who embraced environment- and disease-related explanations precisely when historians concluded that the written record had confirmed the deplorable misdeeds of Columbus and his confederates.\n\nFor these contrarians, 1492 marked the beginning of an age where groups of people across the world began to create a global world-system. Or at least their ruling classes did. The old narrative of conquest, violence, and atrocity was thus transformed into a story where elites made modernity, the popular struggles waged against them receding into the background.\n\nChanging perceptions about Native American societies played an interesting role in the development of this globalization narrative.\n\nUntil the mid-twentieth century, the lack of interest in Native American history helped perpetuate myths about indigenous society and culture as a romantic Eden, subsequently corrupted by the sins of Europe.\n\nYet indigenous societies were quite stratified - especially those of the Aztecs and Incans. Far from egalitarian paradises, such societies had a clear elite class that exploited subordinate groups.\n\nThe myths about a Native American Eden came less from the writings of people living in 1492 and more from naturalists, philosophers, and scientists of the nineteenth century, who painted a blissful image of the \"Indian\" as ineluctably in tune with nature, lost to those who were \"civilized.\"\n\nBut as that rosy view began to crumble, uglier depictions took its place. Now some historians describe the Aztecs as a \" culture obsessed with death .\" Even more astute historians mistake the grotesque actions and behaviors of the elite ruling class as representative of Native American societies as a whole.\n\nAt the same time, crusading Spaniards are increasingly offered apologetics, or even hailed for their ostensible benevolence.\n\nThe chief example is Bartolomé de las Casas - \"Defender of the Indies.\" While de las Casas freed his slaves - and dedicated nearly half a century to fighting for Native Americans in the courts of Valladolid, Barcelona, and Seville - he kept his critiques of colonial endeavors confined to violent outbreaks. He still clung to a belief in Christian authority, whose supremacy Native Americans challenged when they asked why crosses came at the barrels of guns. Even the historian most responsible for our current knowledge and study of Las Casas - Lewis Hanke - saw the Bishop as representing the more benevolent elements of Hispanic conquest.\n\nWhether or not the Spanish monarchy was in favor of providing good treatment for their vassals, it is clear the enforcement of such treatment was not a high priority. The only time the Crown contested abuses and atrocities in the Caribbean - and later New Spain - was when they coincided with larger struggles of authority over an increasingly restless American Spanish elite.\n\nIn short, rather than supplying a more nuanced view of Spanish conquest, the revival of Las Casas's intellectual writings has conveniently obscured questions of actual brutality.\n\nSo if the prevailing narrative is lacking, what's a more accurate depiction?\n\nLet me offer a counter-synthesis: in 1492, Christopher Columbus sailed across the Caribbean, intending to land in the richest part of Asia. Mistakenly believing he had accomplished his task, Columbus reported back that it was only a matter of time before the Crown could collect on its investment.\n\nOn his return journey, Columbus brought back six Native American slaves, ushering in a network of Native American slavery throughout the Spanish world (and replicating what Europeans had done on the Mediterranean for centuries).\n\nRealizing that the Spaniards intended to establish a permanent presence and brutally exploit them, Native American groups like the Taíno and the Caribs fought back , joined by African slaves brought to the Caribbean. The failure to find gold in Hispaniola, compounded by mounting debt and an increasingly scarce supply of food, drove the colonists to desperation. And Native Americans paid the price. While diseases exacerbated the number of casualties, the primary cause of death for Native Americans, especially between 1492 and 1550, was enslavement, famine, and exhaustion .\n\nThis might have been the end of the story: a failure to colonize the Caribbean. But Hernan Cortés, in defiance of Cuban governor Diego Velázquez, sailed from the Caribbean to Veracruz, where he docked - and subsequently sank - the ships that had brought his crew. With only one way forward, Cortés' group, flanked and subsumed by an independent Tlaxcalan army, invaded Tenochtitlan. The heart of the Aztec Empire fell to Spanish rule.\n\nMore than likely, Aztec and Incan societies were themselves predicated on social stratification between elite and commoner classes, with the former paying the latter in taxes and tribute. Such a structure was largely co-opted by the Spaniards, who became the system's ultimate benefactors.\n\nWhile directly connecting this moment to the development of a world-system of capital is difficult , the violent struggle between Spanish and English conquistadors and intellectuals undoubtedly sustained the countries in their wars on the European continent. What's more, this exploitation gave Europe the time and space it needed to finally catch up with regions like China and pull ahead of Native cities like Tenochtitlan and Cuzco. The cost, however, was millions of Native American lives and an expansive and racialized slavery regime the likes of which the world had never seen.\n\nParts of this narrative are debatable; it is not meant to be the story of the Americas. But it is a narrative that is debatable in human terms, with political stakes. Disease, environments, and technology are part of the story, but each requires a particular political will to be potent aspects.\n\nIt is a narrative of moral culpability, and political motivations. And if it bears on modern political discussions, it does so only when we ask what decisions humans make to help or hurt one another.\n\nSo happy Columbus Day. Donate your time and energy today to building something Columbus stood firmly against: a society based on the fundamental humanity of all.\n\nMarley-Vincent Lindsey is a graduate student in history at Brown University.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIn the movie Our Brand Is Crisis , Sandra Bullock's character hears upon arriving in Bolivia that it is like \"there were two-hundred million Apache back home.\" Bolivia's poverty and racial inequality derive in no small part from the brutally extractive institutions erected by the Spanish to manage and exploit indigenous labor.\n\nIn contrast, Thanksgiving in the United States is a fat-saturated offering of gratitude for the immense economic prosperity made possible by indigenous conquest. From Labrador to Araucanía, aboriginal people paid a steep price for this success. Today, Americans celebrate one possible historical outcome of their ancestors' encounter with the native populations, but other trajectories are worth contemplating.\n\nThe economic historian Douglass North - a complex thinker worth grappling with as well as being a self-described \"Marxist of the Right\" - blamed institutions for underdevelopment. His argument works the other way, too: The United States boasts about having the world's greatest democracy, with a broad franchise, extensive civil liberties, and never-fail Whig instincts, leading us to conclude that these institutions are the source of American economic strength. So the standard story goes.\n\nTo be sure, as Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson have argued, where settlers enjoy military and ecological advantage, they erect social structures that deliver economic growth and relative political equality within the settler population. Of course, the viability of these settler-only colonies depends on decimating indigenous populations. The brutal dispossession and death borne by locals built democracy and long-run GDP growth for the descendants of the settlers.\n\nBut what about the folks on the losing end of that encounter? Would the United States appear so prosperous without Native American population collapse?\n\nWhile counterfactual history over five hundred years looks more like speculative fiction than social science, we can conjecture that the United States would look much more like apartheid settler states - Israel or predemocracy South Africa, for example - were it not for the epidemics and wars that wiped out the local population.\n\nCan we account for the ghosts of five centuries of missing people? If destroying aboriginal resistance was the cost of economic development, perhaps we should rescale contemporary prosperity to account for the mass killing required to secure it.\n\nHenry Dobyns estimated that the Timucuan-speaking population in Florida was 722,000 in 1517, dropping to 36,450 by 1613-17, suggesting comparable population collapses across the Southeastern United States, where density and social complexity were quite high. At contact, somewhere between two and eighteen million Native Americans lived across North America, with some estimates outside these bounds. Let's take the midpoint of these numbers - around ten million in 1500 - and extrapolate the population structure we would have today if they had been allowed to embark on normal demographic trajectories.\n\nRich theoretical dynamics of population growth, involving age structure, disease load, food availability and all that, would of course give us a clearer and more accurate picture. But let me abstract from these nuances and just give a simple calculation, taking an estimate of indigenous populations in 1500 and an informed guess for population growth.\n\nIf ten million Native Americans experienced .5 percent population growth - a possibly conservative figure, considering indigenous populations were likely nowhere near the carrying capacity of the environment (world population growth has been almost 1 percent per year over the twentieth century, maxing out at 1.18 percent) - then the United States would currently have at least 130 million natives.\n\nIf they had been treated the same way Protestant colonialists treated other native populations - segregation with little intermixing - the resulting impoverishment would have radically reshaped the American social landscape.\n\nCounterfactuals on this scale are tough, but in the spirit of Kim Stanley Robinson , let us give it the old science-fiction try. The two graphs show the relative Native American population two different ways, and the actual population trajectory versus the simulated one under normal demographics.\n\nAs can be seen from the bottom graph, even with conservative assumptions, Native Americans would account for around 35 percent of US population in today's alternate universe.\n\nLet's assume that American society repressed and excluded natives no more and no less than it does in the real world, and so suppose that they would earn the income per capita of current Native Americans, roughly $18,000 a year. American GDP per capita would fall from $54,000 to something like $40,000, roughly equal to France. Inequality would obviously be much greater, something like what contemporary Colombia - the world's eighth most unequal country - experiences.\n\nOf course, these are just rough calculations, and the entire exercise is pretty speculative. But the effects of this thought experiment ripple out in fascinating ways.\n\nThe whole American social structure would obviously have changed. The political institutions required would have probably made the United States more like Latin America than the United Kingdom.\n\nColossally larger humanitarian disasters - massacres, population displacements, and internment camps - would have been necessary to keep the native population separate from the settlers.\n\nSlavery on a large scale would likely have been maintained. Columbus turned first contact into the first Atlantic slave trade, filling boats back to Spain with captured Native Americans. Recent scholarship has shown how violence and coerced labor played an important role in creating the conditions for population collapse in the New World. Just as European slave demand amplified pre-existing slave systems beyond recognition in Africa, so too in the New World.\n\nAccording to historian Andrés Reséndez, between 1670 and 1720 Carolinians exported more Native Americans out of Charleston than they imported Africans. The history of the other Providence suggests that Puritans didn't oppose slavery if economic returns went high enough. The northern Puritans certainly tried to follow the Spanish example, but found the indigenous population too resistant to keep captured locally. So Massachusetts clamors for a \"juste warre\" against the Pequots, to capture native slaves to trade for black slaves from the Caribbean.\n\nWhile disease is likely the main culprit behind early native population collapse, its killing potential was amplified by forced sedentary settlement, forced population movements, and forced labor induced by indigenous slavery. Pathogens thrived in a malnourished, overworked, and congested population.\n\nWould the United States have engaged in the African slave trade with as much gusto if it had a domestic source of coerced labor? Even with a large native population, African slaves' value could have been high - the malaria introduced by the colonists would have favored African immunities - and would have just meant much larger Cherokee and Choctaw populations to evict from the Southeast and much larger reservations in the West.\n\nOr perhaps not - had Native American population growth followed general demographic trends, the United States would probably look more like Mexico or the Andean countries than it does like Europe.\n\nSettler colonies, like those that eventually became the United States, may have wound up with social structures that created more economic development relative to other colonies, but this is largely by accidents of guns, germs, and steel chains rather than by design.\n\nNothing about European culture granted contemporary Americans the relative economic comfort they're celebrating today: it was that early colonists eradicated, rather than enslaved, the indigenous population. That's all that differentiates the Plymouth Protestants from the Spanish conquistadors or the South African Boers.\n\nSuresh Naidu is an Assistant Professor of Economics and International Affairs at Columbia University.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

The Green New Deal could do even more.\n\nA group of men planting trees during a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) project on the Nett Lake Reservation in Minnesota.\nMPI / Getty\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe Green New Deal has moved from a policy few had ever heard of to a litmus test issue for Democrats, thanks mostly to agitation from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. How should we think about the original New Deal in pushing for a green one?\n\nDoug Henwood put this question to Richard Walker, professor emeritus of geography at the University of California-Berkeley for Henwood's podcast Behind the News . Walker is the director of the Living New Deal , a project devoted to educating Americans about what is possible when government is dedicated to the public good and national reconstruction. Here, he recounts the vast scope of the original New Deal, its complicated relationship to white supremacy, and why a Green New Deal that restricts itself to tackling the climate crisis will be \"dead in the water.\"\n\nAs we think about a possible Green New Deal , what lessons does the original New Deal hold?\n\nThe first lesson is about ambition . The Green New Deal resolution is in line with the original New Deal's ambitious aims. The New Deal introduced a wide array of programs that addressed a broad spectrum of the country's problems. The Green New Deal tries to do a similar thing. It doesn't just attack climate change, but also social justice, jobs, wages, infrastructure, modernization, and more. That's what the Roosevelt administration tried to do.\n\nA lot of centrist types object to the Green New Deal's proposed wide swath of programs. They think it's too broad, too inclusive - that we should focus on climate alone. What do you say to that?\n\nI saw a Washington Post editorial to that effect. I was appalled. Focusing on climate alone would be so narrow-minded - and it would make a Green New Deal politically dead in the water.\n\nI admire the Green New Deal's approach to climate change (which is, by the way, a lot like the target-setting already in place in California, my home state). Yet climate change isn't the only serious problem we face as a nation. There's the issue of low wages, poor quality of jobs, regional decline - and, of course, massive inequality.\n\nYou have to address those issues, which have led to tremendous political alienation in the country and fueled the right-wing populism that we see benefiting Trump and the Republicans. If you don't deal with the needs of working people, you can kiss all major climate policies goodbye. You'll still be living in the world of Trump.\n\nA lot of people today aren't fully aware of the breadth of the New Deal's achievements. You have been working on this project, the Living New Deal, cataloging its heritage and legacy. Give us a sense of the breadth of these programs and what the New Deal's heritage has been.\n\nI have been amazed since we started the Living New Deal at what I didn't know, even though I thought I was reasonably well-informed about the New Deal. For example, at one point we decided to write summaries of all New Deal programs. I thought there would be a couple dozen, but they added up to over sixty, and we still haven't done all of them.\n\nNew Deal programs covered pretty much everything: financial reform, farm support, industrial price and trade policies, housing - both housing finance and public housing - and economic recovery. It was also very \"green\" and included many conservation programs, like reforestation and soil protection. Then, of course, there were the well-known ones like Social Security and the relief programs.\n\nThe unemployment relief programs were many and varied. Some of them people have heard of, like the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and the Works Progress Administration (WPA). But some, like the Civil Works Administration or the National Youth Administration, almost nobody's heard of. Altogether these were very effective in providing jobs for upwards of 12 to 15 million Americans who were out of work and lowering the unemployment rate from 25 to 10 percent.\n\nThere's also the physical heritage of the New Deal - the post offices, the bridges. We still depend upon this infrastructure.\n\nThat's right. It was not just a relief program, but a program of investment all over the country in infrastructure and civic works. The biggest single program was road-building, which includes bridges. But there were enormous numbers of dams and waterworks, water supply systems, city halls, schools, sewage projects. You name it, they did it.\n\nThe New Deal brought large parts of the country into the twentieth century. It was a modernization program, bringing about a modern road system, clean water and a modern electric grid - even to the most remote back corners of the country.\n\nYou can imagine a similar program today supplying everyone with high-speed internet or bringing energy conservation programs and green energy to every town, every rural area, every household.\n\nI recently interviewed Daniel Aldana Cohen about his Jacobin piece on the possibility of a housing program as part of a Green New Deal. He emphasized the fact that a lot of the architects who were involved in the New Deal went for beauty. The dams of the Tennessee Valley Authority were meant to be beautiful as well as functional.\n\nThe New Deal had plenty of room for art and commissioned literature. These were not Philistines.\n\nThat's absolutely right. Good design was the cherry on top of the infrastructure sundae: they built all this practical stuff that's long-lasting and serves the public, then added to this commitment to building things that were beautiful and uplifted public spirits in a very depressing time.\n\nWe could sure use that again today, in our own depressing time.\n\nThe American people view government as kind of boring, at best - a practical necessity, but not something that brings elegance and uplift, music and theater and artworks, to their everyday lives. Yet the New Deal did that. It was a tiny part of the cost of the overall programs, but it added so much. Even today, when people look back to New Deal the thing they remember most are the murals in post offices and civic buildings.\n\nYou organized a conference in the midst of the 2008 financial crisis about the New Deal and its lessons for getting out of that crisis. I remember somebody in the audience mentioned the fact there was a sculpture somewhere on the Berkeley campus with a plaque that brags that no public funds were used in commissioning or executing this sculpture. The sensibility that has evolved over the last seventy years against using public funds for things like sculptures is remarkable.\n\nIt's an ideology that is fine with luxury in the corporate sector and in private-sector buildings. Enormous, grotesque houses for the wealthy, country clubs, art in corporate skyscrapers - all that is fine. But the public should get nothing but the leanest and meanest.\n\nThat kind of thinking is the result of the revolt against the New Deal that started once the capitalists were back on their feet in the 1940s. The argument was that the government can't provide all this good stuff - people need to meet those needs through private capital.\n\nIn fact, that has been a magnificent illusion of bourgeois ideology for two hundred years. The government is a necessary evil rather than something that's part of our daily lives and part of the way we not only govern ourselves, but how we live and enjoy ourselves, as well. The pursuit of happiness doesn't have to be in private only. It should be a collective, public, governmental goal, too.\n\nA rap against the original New Deal - which you hear fairly often partly because Hillary Clinton and centrists Democrats revived it as a rap against Bernie Sanders and the revival of social democracy, and unfortunately people on the Left have been quick to pick up - is that the New Deal was racist; that the exclusions in Social Security, housing, and many other New Deal programs were adjuncts of white supremacy. What do you say to that?\n\nTo fairly evaluate the New Deal, you have to go back to 1930s and ask: where was America at the time? This was a white supremacist country, as it always had been. Racism was the rule of the day. Jim Crow laws were widespread not only in the South but in the North. Think of what we had done up to that point: the long-term genocide and suppression of native peoples, black slavery, repression and exclusion of Chinese, Mexicans, Filipinos, and so on. White people were very begrudging of giving anything to people of color, and not just African Americans.\n\nThat's the world the New Deal inherited. The Civil Rights Movement and its fundamental challenge to white supremacy hadn't happened yet - that came a generation later. The New Deal didn't challenge the racial order head on and failed on that front in a number of ways.\n\nBut that's not the same as saying it was simply racist. In fact, most of the leading New Dealers - such as Eleanor Roosevelt, Harold Ickes, Frances Perkins, and Harry Hopkins - were outspoken antiracists and made a systematic effort to include people of color in New Deal programs.\n\nAs a result, most New Deal programs were reached out to native peoples, black people, Latinos, and Asians in an unprecedented way. People of color worked in all the big relief programs, and there were specific investment, education, and health projects aimed at oppressed peoples. For example, the New Deal's Indian policy was the best deal Native Americans had seen from the federal government up to that time. We would do it differently now, but the New Deal made a genuine effort to allow native sovereignty, employed tens of thousands of natives in work programs, improved reservation lands, built schools and provided for native education, and so on.\n\nOn the other hand, President Roosevelt compromised with the Southern Democrats in Congress, who were a big part of the New Deal coalition and a mixed bag of populists and power-brokers in the Jim Crow South - not to mention big growers in California and Texas. Those compromises led to farm workers and domestic workers being left out of two major pieces of legislation: Social Security and the National Labor Relations Act. Most of those labor forces were African American and Mexican American, plus some Asian Americans.\n\nIt's a mixed record. Yet even though the New Deal fell far short of ending racism, it helped set in motion the forces that would overthrow Jim Crow in the postwar era. Its modernization programs brought most of rural America into the mainstream, its employment programs brought jobs, better wages, and dignity to workers of color, and its services programs provided better health, education, and skills to many underprivileged Americans. In addition, the employment of African Americans in federal line agencies tripled during the New Deal era.\n\nOn top of that, Roosevelt appointed an unprecedented number of African Americans to high positions in the federal government, including the first federal judge. Many such people, such as Mary McLeod Bethune, Lawrence Oxley, and Robert Weaver, went on to be civil rights leaders.\n\nIn sum, simply stating that \"the New Deal was racist\" is not helpful, underestimates the New Deal's impact on racism in America, and undermines the idea that anything as ambitious and progressive as the New Deal can be done in this country today.\n\nOne particular sore spot is housing. A lot of the redlining practices affected the geographical pattern of housing for generations afterwards so happened then, what about the redlining ? How did that come to be?\n\nHousing exclusion and racial segregation were ubiquitous in America at the time. The South had different system where black people lived on the back alleys in the town, so it looked like they were living closer to whites. But they were kept \"in their place\" by Jim Crow.\n\nThe North was less clear about those hierarchies, but racial segregation was very popular among white people. The effort to exclude went back to the nineteenth century when upper-class whites started using the first deed covenants to keep the riff-raff out wealthier neighborhoods. That meant not just people of color but European immigrants, as well as industry and commerce.\n\nIn the early twentieth century, developers and local governments created zoning laws that separated cities into zones to protect upper-class, single-family residential areas. Sometimes these were explicitly racial, sometimes they weren't; but the effect was exactly the same. All of that precedes New Deal housing policy by fifty years.\n\nWhen New Deal housing policies were written, agency administrators at the Home Owners Loan Corporation (HOLC), Federal Housing Administration (FHA), and US Housing Administration (USHA) were chiefly interested in saving homeowners, creating more homeownership, and providing more housing for working people. Unfortunately, they largely went along with established practices of racial segregation. But there's a mistaken view among some critics that the FHA and HOLC invented segregation and imposed their rules on a reluctant America. That's nonsense. They were going along with the existing racial divisions and housing practices.\n\nWhat was the hand of the real estate industry in redlining?\n\nThe real estate industry was right at the center of it. It wasn't just \"white preference\" for segregation - the industry had a direct financial interest in making sure that it could create these exclusive zones on the model of the upper-class districts like the Country Club District in Kansas City, Roland Park in Baltimore, Forest Hills in New York, or St Francis Woods in San Francisco.\n\nThey wanted to make sure their investments in these upper-class developments were not going to be jeopardized. Hence, exclusionary zoning laws and deed covenants were eagerly supported by the National Association of Real Estate Boards (NAREB), which had become very powerful in the early twentieth century. Not surprisingly, NAREB helped Congress write the legislation for the HOLC and FHA, and their people moved into the agencies to write the administrative guidelines, as well.\n\nThe Roosevelt administration just basically went along with it, though?\n\nTo a certain degree. They were not in a position to overthrow the racial structure of America. Perhaps they could have done better and taken stronger positions on civil rights, as when FDR refused to endorse a proposed federal anti-lynching law. Yet some of them were quite outspoken and opposed FDR's decision on that and other compromises. Roosevelt himself always played his cards close to the vest, so we don't know exactly what he thought about racism. As a practical matter, he believed that if he bucked white supremacy, the New Deal coalition would come apart.\n\nNevertheless, the New Deal did counter America's racial order in a variety of ways. Of utmost importance was that the relief agencies employed over a million people of color and discrimination of any kind was barred by Executive Order. The Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) is often cited as a segregated program, but at the outset the CCC was largely integrated in the North; only intense opposition from nearby residents in mostly rural areas (and the South) forced the CCC to separate whites from blacks and other people of color.\n\nSimilarly, the Works Progress Administration (WPA) employed hundreds of thousands of African, Asian, Mexican, and Native American citizens every year - a higher percentage than in the private labor force. Relief workers were paid equal wages because WPA leaders like Harry Hopkins and Ellen Woodward demanded it. These were not all male construction workers; women of color were hired as teachers, social workers, librarians, and in other professional and service jobs. Many of these used integrated teams.\n\nThe New Deal ended Hoover's aggressive deportation of Mexicans and invested heavily in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and Hawai'i. Many New Deal projects specifically addressed the needs of poor communities of color, providing housing, clinics, schools, and education, as well as assisting tenant farmers. WPA recreation facilities like swimming pools were meant to be integrated, an unprecedented move - unless white protest made this untenable.\n\nIn short, the outlook, policies and programs of the New Deal, while far from perfect, marked an important step forward for the federal government and contributed to the welfare and advancement of millions of citizens of color.\n\nRoosevelt had a big congressional majority and swept into office multiple times with big margins of victory. Now, we have a Senate controlled by crazy Republicans. The House has some lively progressives, but most of the Democratic delegation is nothing to write home about. And we have a cretin as president rather than a somewhat enlightened aristocrat. How do we navigate the present political terrain? Or is this a project for the longer term?\n\nThere is a very serious de-legitimization of the political ruling elite right now because of Trump. Trump may have been doing us a favor, just because his administration is so disgusting that people are turned off. The situation is so degraded that we do have a pretty solid majority of Americans who think this is nuts. Bold progressive leadership is going to look more enlightened and appealing, by contrast.\n\nThe other thing we have is climate change. At least two-thirds of Americans think climate change is a serious problem. We can see it around us in floods, hurricanes, droughts, fires. You can mobilize a lot of people around a Green New Deal because of climate change.\n\nAnd then, of course, there's the economy. There's a lot of tub-thumping from Trump about how great it's been, but the Great Recession was catastrophic. Millions of people suffered greatly from unemployment and housing foreclosures, and after ten years of recovery wages haven't budged. Many jobs are terrible - they're not protected by unions and they're more exposed to hazards and exploitation because regulations have been cut. Most working Americans are very well aware of these conditions and are looking for a means of seeing real improvement in the quality of jobs, raising wages, and less inequality. Again, a Green New Deal can appeal to a broad swath of working people.\n\nWe also see a split America today, a situation that a Green New Deal must address. We tend to fall back on lazy simplifications about urban America versus rural, evangelical America versus progressive, rational America versus people duped by Fox News; and so on. But the fact is that Trump captured a lot of votes from people who are genuinely desperate after thirty years of deindustrialization and the long-term decline of small towns, small industrial cities, and rural areas. That decline has been devastating.\n\nThe Green New Deal doesn't address clearly enough this problem of rural decline and rural suffering. The New Deal did and that was crucial to its popularity and success. We need a similarly massive investment, job creation, and public works program to aid damaged areas and to bring them into the twenty-first century the way the New Deal brought so much of the backwoods America into the twentieth century.\n\nYou can imagine the possibilities: serious investment in small towns, improving schools, providing clean water, upgrading sewage plants, building new civic institutions, improving parks, and insulating buildings and homes. This should be done with the active participation of local people, doing useful work in and for their communities. You could have teams of skilled people working with local youth to teach new skills. Local folks and politicians would support that because there is direct evidence that a Green New Deal is serving them, their community, their kids.\n\nThe Green New Deal must not just meet the challenge of climate change. It must also revive the economy, raise wages, and renew lagging communities across the country. In short, it must speak to the vast majority of Americans or it is, as I said at the beginning, dead on arrival.\n\nRichard Walker is a professor emeritus of Geography at the University of California-Berkeley and director of the Living New Deal, which is documenting and mapping the legacy of the New Deal, especially its public works.\n\nDoug Henwood edits Left Business Observer and is the host of Behind the News .

And though its record on racial equality was imperfect, it helped undermine key parts of Jim Crow.\n\nAn integrated group of uniformed CCC enrollees at the March Field District in Riverside County, California, 1933. (FDR Presidential Library and Museum)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nWith President Joe Biden's victory last November, the year 2021 has drawn comparisons to the situation faced by President Franklin D. Roosevelt (FDR) as he entered office in the midst of the Great Depression, and calls for reviving parts of the New Deal have been heard from many quarters. This is not idle speculation, because today's challenges of inequality, injustice, unemployment, and global warming are so grave that they can only be met by sweeping federal policies comparable to the New Deal of the 1930s.\n\nFor example, in his 2020 presidential campaign, Senator Bernie Sanders pushed a plan for spending $171 billion for a Civilian Climate Corps. By late April of this year, Senator Ed Markey and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez - leading proponents of a Green New Deal - had also unveiled their ambitious plan for a Civilian Climate Corps that would employ a diverse group of 1.5 million young people over five years.\n\nRecruits would work on projects to address climate change (land, water, and energy conservation), community development (schools, clinics, parks, and social services), and environmental justice (impacted communities would provide half the recruits and receive half the projects). In the meantime, President Biden included a Civilian Climate Corps as part of his own American Jobs Plan (AJP), looking to provide perhaps $10 billion over ten years to drive the program. A new Civilian Climate Corps continues to be one of the programs that progressives in Congress are pushing to include in the $3.5 trillion spending bill that is expected to be put into final form and voted on next week.\n\nWhy did these politicians hit on the model of Roosevelt's Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) for their Civilian Climate Corps? There are four good reasons. First, the CCC was the most popular of FDR's programs - with the men who served, the local communities that benefitted, and the general public. Second, the CCC employed more than 3 million young men from 1933 to 1942, saving them from despair and their families from destitution. Third, the CCC gave recruits the opportunity to do useful work, learn self-discipline, develop job skills, and acquire basic education (many were illiterate). Fourth, the CCC was the \"greenest\" of the New Deal programs, working across the country to repair a century of rampant deforestation, soil exhaustion, and pollution.\n\nAt the same time, the CCC's record on race and gender has often been criticized. Women were excluded entirely and African American men were often passed over by racist recruiters. There was a lack of people of color in most skilled and supervisory positions, and CCC camps were mostly segregated. These failings of the original CCC would almost certainly will not be repeated today, given social changes over the last century.\n\nStill, the record of the original CCC deserves a closer look, as a matter of historical accuracy and of political urgency. On the one hand, there's a need to address a set of misleading and ahistorical - but unfortunately widespread - arguments that portray the New Deal as fundamentally racist. Not only is that a profoundly misleading depiction of the New Deal; it's an argument that could well be deployed in the future to weaken support for anything echoing the New Deal - including the idea of a new Civilian Climate Corps - even though those kinds of bold federal initiatives are essential to the welfare of all working people in this country.\n\nThis article is an attempt to assess the record of the CCC on race - both the facts of the case and the context of government and civil society in Jim Crow America. In our view, the failings of the CCC were due less to inherent flaws in the program than to the overwhelming facts of life of the 1930s.\n\nIn brief, the CCC began under a clear antidiscrimination rule; fell into line with segregation under external pressure and internal capitulation; bettered its performance with African Americans over its life; and did relatively well by other people of color. By the end, it had provided jobs for hundreds of thousands of young African Americans and other men of color, affording them with much of the same benefits as white people. Overall, the CCC was flawed - but it was better than the country it served.\n\nWorking out of three thousand camps across the country, the CCC helped restore millions of acres of public forest and private agricultural land devastated by two centuries of relentless exploitation, and opened up the vast public domain to mass recreation by its improvements to public parks, forests, and refuges.\n\nCCC enrollees planted 2.3 billion trees for the US Forest Service and millions more in shelterbelts for the Soil Conservation Service (SCS; now the Natural Resources Conservation Service). With the SCS and Grazing Service, they built tens of thousands of erosion barriers, water works, and other improvements on ranches and farms. Under the US Biological Survey (later the Fish & Wildlife Service), they helped develop scores of wildlife refuges and stocked 1 billion fish in America's fresh waters.\n\nMost famously, the CCC worked with the National Park Service and nascent state park authorities to improve recreational and maintenance facilities in all the country's existing national parks, monuments, and forests, along with more than seven hundred state parks. CCC teams created over ninety thousand acres of campgrounds, a hundred forty thousand miles of foot, horse, and truck trails, and forty-five hundred rustic cabins and hiking shelters, as well as rehabilitating thirty-four hundred acres of public beaches.\n\nTo carry out such projects, CCC recruits added a huge amount of infrastructure to public lands, such as hundreds of miles of roads, forty thousand bridges, a hundred seventy landing fields, eighty-nine thousand miles of telephone wire, and thousands of miles of water pipes. Their fire protection work was legion, as they built thirty-eight hundred fire watchtowers, cleared thousands of miles of fuel breaks, and fought hundreds of fires.\n\nCCC enrollees were recruited from all around the country for six-month stints. The majority were sent far from home, mostly out west to parks, forests, farms, and range lands. The young men received food, accommodation, clothing, and medical care, and they were paid a modest $30 a month, $25 of which had to be sent home to their families.\n\nThey rose early and worked full days in challenging conditions of hot sun, dense forests, steep mountains, poison oak and ivy, and inclement weather. After work, recreational sports, movies, and music were encouraged and educational courses offered, from basic literacy to botany. Saturdays were set aside for leisure or visits to local communities and Sundays included time for religious services. Enrollees overwhelmingly reported that they finished in better health and better educated than when they entered, with large numbers re-upping.\n\nThe young men of the CCC were mostly from the bottom of the working class. An internal survey in 1937 showed the typical recruit had never held a full-time job, had been jobless for seven months prior to enrollment, and was from a family whose male head of household was unemployed; less than a third had experienced on-the-job training of any sort. As James McEntee, the CCC's second director, put it: \"They were drawn almost entirely from that third of the population which President Roosevelt has described as 'ill-fed, ill-housed and ill-clothed.'\"\n\nThis enormous endeavor was not accomplished with the wave of a magic wand. It took rapid planning and on-the-fly adjustments at every stage of the process: recruitment and assignment, setting up camps, company management, identifying projects and tasks, training and education, and more.\n\nThe paucity of administrative capacity in government at the time meant that the way to get the program up and running quickly was to call on the US Army. The CCC was organized into companies and camps, whose commander was a career army officer or, later, a reserve officer. At first, noncommissioned officers carried out orders from the officers in day-to-day operations; later on, more civilians were brought in to serve in these positions.\n\nThe CCC was close to President Roosevelt's heart; he was a committed conservationist and admirer of the Boy Scouts. The federal program was modeled after New York state's Temporary Emergency Relief Administration (TERA), when FDR was governor. Yet, today it can be hard to imagine the speed with which the CCC moved forward.\n\nRoosevelt's inauguration took place on March 4, 1933, he made a request to Congress for an Emergency Conservation Work Program on March 21, and SB 598 passed both houses of Congress and was signed on March 31. The induction of the first CCC enrollee came on April 7 and the first CCC camp was established at the George Washington National Forest in Virginia ten days later.\n\nThree serious problems were exposed at the start. The first was labor competition. The unions, represented by the American Federation of Labor, were initially opposed to the CCC arguing that enrollees would displace free laborers, that low pay would depress wages and undermine the contractual rights of workers. In an era of fascist mobilization, labor leaders also expressed concerns that the CCC could lead to \"militarized labor.\"\n\nThe unions were eventually won over, and fears about undermining prevailing wage rates proved unfounded. Roosevelt brought the unions on board by appointing labor officials to direct the CCC: Robert Fechner, general vice president of the International Association of Machinists (IAM) and James McEntee, also of the IAM.\n\nA second issue was that the CCC was planned entirely for and by men. A few critics raised objections - most notably Frances Perkins and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt - who worked behind the scenes to create a parallel program for women, administered by the Federal Emergency Relief Administration led by Harry Hopkins, popularly known as the \"She-She-She.\" But it was limited in scope and short-lived, reflecting the general patriarchy at a time when women had only recently won the vote, had few legal rights, and were regarded as unsuited for manual labor.\n\nA third problem dogging the CCC from the beginning was race. Unsurprisingly, given that this was the height of the Jim Crow era, racial justice was not a priority. An amendment introduced by Congressman Oscar S. De Priest, a Republican from Chicago and the only African-American member of the House of Representatives, barred discrimination in the CCC based on race, color, or creed, and was incorporated into the final legislation. The amendment was supported by FDR, who wanted to win over progressive critics and who followed up with an antidiscrimination Executive Order in 1935.\n\nIf the shortcomings of the CCC around labor, gender, and race were clear from the outset, only the first was resolved - in large part because unions were there to defend the interests of workers. The Roosevelt administration was focused on economic recovery and its leadership moved quickly to bring the working class into the New Deal coalition. Race and gender were another matter.\n\nOne of the hardest issues CCC leaders would have to cope with was the country's rigid racial order, which in the early 1930s went almost completely unchallenged in mainstream politics. The interwar period was the high tide of Jim Crow, a system rooted in the South but instantiated throughout the country. The law could declare discrimination illegal, but how it was carried out proved to be a different thing.\n\nNevertheless, the New Deal itself brought a remarkable upheaval on many fronts of American life, and it would set in motion changes that would help build the civil rights movement, give greater autonomy to native tribes, and advance women's standing in society. These were felt to a limited degree within the confines of the CCC program, but much more beyond, as the New Dealers responded to a changing electorate, outside pressure, and inside activism, especially by black activists.\n\nOver the course of the 1930s, the New Deal expanded federal employment of people of color, desegregated federal offices, enforced nondiscrimination in Public Works Administration contracts and Works Progress Administration equal pay rules, expanded National Youth Administration employment of minority professionals, created the first federal Office of Civil Rights, and integrated military contracting.\n\nEven if the CCC was not at the forefront of most of these developments, it still scored some significant achievements for access and inclusion. In this regard, a closer review of the situation for African Americans, Native Americans, and others is called for if the CCC is to be judged accurately on both its accomplishments and failures.\n\nThe CCC did not exclude African Americans, as is sometimes claimed. In fact, more than three hundred thousand young black men and thirty thousand black veterans served during its ten-year existence. For tens of thousands of young African-American men, participation in the CCC provided a refuge and sustenance at a time when millions of black people were awash in poverty and hopelessness.\n\nNevertheless, there were substantial barriers to full participation in the CCC. To begin with, the number of African Americans was capped at 10 percent of all enrollees - the rough percentage of African Americans in the United States population. This was seen as a \"fair\" rule of thumb by Director Fechner, even though it was decidedly less than adequate when measured against the disproportionate unemployment and poverty of African Americans.  Worse, recruiters in most Southern states rarely accepted \"Negro\" recruits into the CCC, considering white people as more deserving of help and arguing that black people were needed at home for growing and harvesting cotton - a reflection of the South's fundamental reliance on extremely low-paid African-American labor.\n\nContrary to common opinion, segregation of CCC camps was not the rule from the beginning. In the South, of course, integration was a dead letter. In the North and West, however, several camps started out with black and white people in the same companies. Notably, this experiment with integrated camps came more than a decade before the military was integrated in 1948 and despite army resistance.\n\nNevertheless, integrated CCC camps - and even all-black camps - faced hostility from neighboring communities, which sent letters of complaint to the director, Congress, and the president. On top of this, internal relations between black and white enrollees could be tense, leading to fights and general discord.\n\nThe result was that black and white CCC companies and camps were soon separated, and the experiment with integration ended in 1935. It did not help that Director Fechner came from Tennessee. Fechner danced around the requirements of the De Priest amendment, offering the standard separate-but-equal ideology of Plessy v. Ferguson as an excuse in a letter to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP): \"This segregation is not discrimination and cannot be so construed. The Negro companies are assigned to the same types of work, have identical equipment, are served the same food, and have the same quarters as white enrollees.\"\n\nThe resegregation of the CCC infuriated civil rights groups, but their sway was limited. Political pressure did succeed, however, in forcing the CCC to promote more African Americans into supervisory and skilled positions. In August 1935, FDR had the army call up a number of African-American reserve officers to fill CCC administrative positions, and by 1936 African-American officers commanded two CCC companies in New York and Pennsylvania.\n\nSimultaneously, African-American enrollees began to be assigned positions of authority and responsibility at the camps, such as squad leader, company clerk, and educational advisor; and were recruited for skilled jobs instead of being consigned to the most demeaning tasks.\n\nThe CCC Educational Program was particularly important for enhancing the responsibilities given to black men. While the start was slow, more than a dozen African-American educational advisors were in place by mid-1934, and by September 1935, African Americans were being appointed as educational advisors throughout most of the country. By 1940, few of the 153 African-American companies lacked such advisors. These men had a leading role at the camp level, including crafting classroom instruction and providing on-the-job training programs.\n\nMany of the projects undertaken by CCC teams - both white and black - required only the simplest types of common labor, yet African-American CCC veterans, like their white counterparts, regularly reported that the CCC taught them habits of cooperation and conscientiousness, and that they appreciated learning skills such as equipment operation, carpentry, mechanics, electrical repair, and construction.\n\nThe limits on opportunity for African Americans in Jim Crow America must be recognized, however, and many of the skills acquired did not translate to post-CCC jobs - especially in fields such as botany, forestry, and wildlife management. Skills in journalism, radio, and photography also added little to black men's future employability in a world of intense racial discrimination. Once again, the good intentions of the CCC ran into the harsh reality of Jim Crow America.\n\nOn balance, for young black men the CCC was a valuable, though limited, program hobbled by the conventional practices of white America. In some ways, it was ahead of its time by attempting the integration of companies and the elevation of African Americans to commanding positions - practices that arrived in the US military only during and after World War II.\n\nIn general, the CCC experience was better than the alternative of unemployment or sharecropping - which was the situation for about 80 percent of all black people. Once in the CCC, young people could engage in useful projects in parks, forests, seashores, and other natural landscapes that offered opportunities for personal development and, just as important, gave them a genuine sense that they had contributed to making their country a better place.\n\nThe New Deal brought about a major reversal in the treatment of Native Americans in the 1930s. The transformation in federal policy toward native peoples was embodied in the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, popularly known as \"the Indian New Deal,\" spearheaded by the US Commissioner of Indian Affairs, John Collier. It ended the devastation of the Dawes Act of 1887, which converted 90 million acres (two-thirds) of tribal treaty land to private holdings in an ill-conceived plan to make indigenous people into small farmers. Almost all this privatized land ended up in white hands.\n\nUnder the 1934 act, tribal self-government was implemented, tribes were allowed to incorporate businesses and run education programs, and employment opportunities were enhanced. By 1940, a hundred thirty-five tribal constitutions had been written, voted on, and put into operation; millions of acres were restored or added to tribal lands, and employment of tribal members was greatly increased in the federal Office of Indian Affairs (renamed the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1947).\n\nThe course of the New Deal for Indians was by no means smooth, and it ran into persistent opposition from white Westerners in Congress and the old guard of Indian agents, as well as from many Native Americans - who had good reason not to trust another round of paternalistic and universalizing policy from the US government. Nevertheless, it brought a sea change in federal policy.\n\nPart of this more enlightened policy was the creation of a parallel CCC, the Indian Emergency Conservation Work (IECW) program. A separate program was requested by Native Americans, who objected to having army-led CCC camps on tribal lands, given the brutal history of conquest. FDR approved almost $6 million in funding for the start of the IECW, later renamed the Civilian Conservation Corps Indian Division (CCC-ID).\n\nThe CCC-ID employed some eighty thousand to eighty-five thousand indigenous men during the years of the Great Depression. This was about 3 percent of the CCC workforce and slightly more than the Native American portion of the population. The Office of Indian Affairs and tribal governments oversaw CCC-ID projects, and the age limitations of enrollees was not as restrictive as the regular CCC.\n\nThe program was focused on tribal lands to restore degraded rangeland, improve water supplies, and promote sustainable grazing. Projects involved road construction, erosion control, reforestation, fish hatcheries, and dams, reservoirs, and water distribution systems. CCC-ID teams worked on two hundred reservations in twenty-three states. The CCC-ID also built dams, roads, trails, and fences on land near reservations. By the end of the CCC-ID program, portions of fifty million acres had been improved. In the words of Collier, \"No previous undertaking in Indian Service has so largely been the Indians' own undertaking.\"\n\nThe CCC-ID was of great value to native peoples simply by providing jobs for people who had suffered from unemployment and dire poverty long before the Great Depression. For example, jobs for half of the male breadwinners on the Sioux reservations in South Dakota and almost half the income of the Papago tribe in Arizona came from the CCC-ID in the mid-1930s.\n\nNative American men received training in gardening, animal husbandry, safety practices, and academic subjects, in the same manner as other CCC recruits, and they felt that they were working to improve their tribal communities as well as themselves. As one enrollee put it: \"This work has provided an income for us and has enabled us to keep alive while, at the same time, it has given us a better perspective on our goals in life.\"\n\nThe Depression did not begin well for Latino Americans. Mexicans and Mexican Americans were hit hard by white xenophobia and violence against migrant workers in the Southwest. Under the presidency of Herbert Hoover, deportations soared, often with the enthusiastic aid of local governments and employers.\n\nThe situation changed significantly once FDR entered the White House. Deportations dropped by roughly half, relief programs came to the aid of impoverished workers and their families, and the State Department joined Mexican American activists to block a case to exclude Mexicans from immigrating to the United States. The CCC recruited thousands of young Mexican Americans across the Southwest, but noncitizen Mexicans did not qualify.\n\nOther than African Americans, Latinos were the largest minority group in California's CCC camps. They were apparently not singled out for racial discrimination as intensively as black people, even though at some locations identification was split between \"W-1\" for white and \"W-2\" for Mexican American. In the reconstruction of La Purísima Mission at Lompoc, the treatment of Mexican American men appears to have been very good, including their use as skilled workers (in sharp contrast to the way white people drove black people out of the Lompoc camp).\n\nNew Deal assistance was substantial for Puerto Rico. The Roosevelt administration funded a public works program larger than anything previously seen on the island and New Deal work relief programs, including the CCC, employed thousands of Puerto Ricans. The island's CCC camps housed over twenty-four hundred men. As on the mainland, the CCC built many of the trails, lookouts, buildings, and roads in various federal and insular parks and forests, including in the majestic El Yunque National Forest.\n\nIn the Pacific, Hawai'i received considerable aid under the New Deal and gained many public work projects. The CCC set up several camps on the Hawai'ian Islands, doing mostly forestry and park work. The corps was also active in Alaska, working with indigenous peoples, such as the Aleuts and Tlingit. Most famous of the CCC works in Alaska was the salvage, repair, and carving of native \"totem poles,\" as part of a US Forest Service effort to employ Alaskan natives and conserve native cultural assets.\n\nThe CCC disbanded in Summer 1942 when Congress ceased funding it. FDR wished to keep it going, but Southern Democrats and Republicans saw an opportunity to end the program - in part because they could not abide the inclusion of African Americans in the CCC. FDR's offer to integrate the National Youth Administration into the CCC was refused.\n\nLooking back from the twenty-first century, how should we judge the CCC? How much good work did it do? Did its performance measure up to its intentions? How did it compare with other elements of the New Deal and with American society in general? These are not simple questions and they are rendered more problematic by the difficulty of putting ourselves in the shoes of those living in another time. As one sage put it, \"The past is another country.\"\n\nIt can be safely said that the CCC did a great deal of good for the country in terms of resource conservation and outdoor recreation - though even here, times have changed, and environmentalists have criticized many of the ideas about fire suppression, pest removal, stream channelization, and so forth that were popular in the 1930s and that guided CCC activities.\n\nThe positive effect of the CCC on its 3 million enrollees is hard to deny. In the midst of the greatest economic collapse in the nation's history, it saved many of them, along with their families, from poverty, homelessness, and despair. It also taught them about the virtues of hard work, the benefits of teamwork, and how to care for land and living things, along with giving them useful skills, greater literacy, and new experiences. The evidence is overwhelming that CCC enrollees held this view themselves, commonly looking back on their time in the corps as one of the best of their lives.\n\nWith regard to race, the record is clearly uneven. While the CCC did not exclude African Americans and even integrated some camps at the outset, it quickly ran up against Jim Crow in the South and white racism most everywhere. As a result, the number of black enrollees might well have been higher and more should have served as supervisors and skilled workers. Yet, there was improvement over the decade in the total number and promotion of black enrollees. The early experiment in integrated companies was unprecedented, but segregating camps was a sad capitulation to the racial order of the day. Nevertheless, African-American CCCers still enjoyed many of the positive experiences, as well as economic benefits, enjoyed by whites.\n\nNotably, the NAACP opposed the shutdown of the CCC. In a letter to a Senate committee chairman, the organization \"pointed out the great benefit . . . to Negro citizens, as well as to Whites, and re-emphasized its conviction that it would do more harm than good to abolish [it].\"\n\nThe CCC's performance with regard to other people of color was much better. The CCC Indian Division was well regarded by many tribes and allowed for a high degree of autonomy. Latinos were not singled out or segregated, and the CCC appears to have been a welcome presence in Puerto Rico, Hawai'i, and Alaska.\n\nOf course, the CCC was only one of dozens of New Deal programs, some of which, like the Works Progress Administration, performed better on racial grounds. There was also improvement in the CCC and other relief programs in the treatment of African Americans, thanks to the growing ranks of black officials within the federal government and increasing awareness of racial injustice among white New Dealers - chiefly due to an expanding black electorate in the North, its wholesale shift from Republican to Democrat, and the heightened militancy of African-American activists.\n\nClearly, while the New Deal revolutionized many aspects of American society and government, it did not confront the country's entrenched racial order. Many of its leaders and programs rose above the general state of affairs, but others acquiesced to the prevailing caste system. Nevertheless, the impact of the New Deal, followed by the World War II, shook the country's political order in a way that loosened the shackles of white domination and helped unleash the struggle for civil rights that would eventually break the mold of Jim Crow America.\n\nMany of the burdens that the CCC and the New Deal had to overcome have been lifted from our own shoulders by the long battle for racial justice. Yet we, too, will be judged and found wanting in the future, so let us approach the tasks ahead in combatting climate change, economic injustice, and racial oppression with care and a degree of humility.\n\nThe authors wish to thank Brent McKee, Marc Dudzic, and Seth Ackerman for their comments and assistance.\n\nPaul J.

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nHollywood loves to crank out boring action movies. But Hulu's Prey is anything but. It plays off of and reverses long-standing Hollywood tropes about Native Americans to craft an alien thriller that actually delivers.\n\nStill from Hulu's Prey . (20th Century Studios)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThere's a climactic action sequence near the end of Prey that is set in the deep forest at night during a gentle snowfall. It represents the final face-off between the towering alien of the Predator franchise and a slender adolescent Comanche girl who's trained herself to be a great hunter. The scene is lit by the alien's iridescent green blood dripping off leaves and trailing across rocks and smearing the combatants as they fight. It's gripping, edge-of-the-seat stuff - exactly the kind of climactic scene that action film fans crave.\n\nIn fact, the whole movie, currently streaming on Hulu, is a remarkably effective and imaginative revival of the sci-fi/action Predator franchise. Though roughly done in many ways - such as the sometimes terrible CGI of the animals, particularly the mountain lion - overall it's a fast-moving, exciting little action film. Writer-director Dan Trachtenberg ( 10 Cloverfield Lane ), working with screenwriter Patrick Aison, is to be congratulated for coming up with a wow of a premise: the first of the ferociously aggressive, nearly unkillable \"predator\" aliens to arrive on Earth lands in Comanche territory in 1719.\n\nIf you know your movie lore, in classic Westerns, the Comanche are often represented as a formidable Great Plains warrior nation, but in cliched terms of villainy. Still, a certain awe was often built into those Westerns, with the single word \"Comanche\" whispered by white settlers terrified by massacres out on the plains.\n\nIt was one of Trachtenberg's goals to make Comanches the leads in their own movie for once. Comanche producer Jhane Myers, who grew up on Predator movies, hoped to do a Comanche language-dominated film (which reflected the original intention for the film, indicated in the script). That option can be selected on Hulu.\n\nUnfortunately, the default version of the film is mostly in English, with only a few lines in Comanche, though the characters are mostly Comanches speaking to one another. The logic of this is confusing, especially when a filthy, scraggy band of French fur trappers turns up who consistently speak French throughout the film, which has no subtitles.\n\nThe cast is uniformly good, particularly Sioux actor Amber Midthunder ( Legion ; Roswell, New Mexico ) playing the lead role of Naru with remarkable poise and charisma. Her gleaming eyes through a wide band of black face paint are the central feature of a star quality you don't often see.\n\nNaru has to teach herself tracking and weaponry skills while her older brother Taabe (Dakota Beavers) is celebrated as a heroic young hunter, the one who comes home with a dead mountain lion slung over his shoulders, to be feted by the whole community. Naru has great gifts too, but they tend to be shrugged off as mere women's skills, such as her healing abilities taught to her by her mother (Michelle Thrush). She's disrespected as a self-taught hunter, specializing in axe-throwing, and she struggles with her own lack of experience, consistently hitting her targets in practice but missing at the crucial moment of action:\n\nNaru: \"I almost brought down a deer today.\"\n\nNaru's mother: \"We can't eat 'almost.'\"\n\nBut her keen ability to observe the behaviors of predators and prey make her the first one to spot and take seriously the strange tracks and bizarre kills of the alien in the woods. And her unorthodox plans of attack will also make her, ultimately, the only member of her community who has a hope of taking on the alien.\n\nNaru has one dedicated comrade, her russet-colored dog Sarii (played by a Carolina dog named Coco). The presence of this wonderfully handsome dog does mean you have to spend the whole movie worrying whether Sarii will survive. But on the other hand, the dog is a very effective source of tension in a film in which multiple sources of tension are artfully combined and then pay off in complex and visceral action scenes.\n\nTrachtenberg warns of what to expect in an early scene when we see an insect eaten by a rat, which is promptly swallowed by a snake, which is in turn... well, you'll have to watch the movie to see what happens to the snake. The point is, chains of predator-prey relationships keep developing and then getting more complicated and then, as humans and aliens are brought into the action, reversing themselves in the film. The young hunters who have to prove themselves in a ritual coming-of-age challenge describe it this way: \"The creature you're hunting is also hunting you.\" That turns out to be excellent training for what's to come.\n\nAs in the rest of the franchise starting with the first, fantastic Predator film of 1987, the alien is humanoid in shape but bigger, stronger, faster, and with far greater mastery of tools. Technology unknown to humans gives the alien heat-vision, meaning it can detect humans by the warmth of their blood, plus the ability to turn transparent, nearly invisible against the wild greenery. Fighting the alien always means finding a way to undermine the power of those two abilities.\n\nBut the alien resembles humans in its merciless, territorial bloodlust that tends to wipe out any living thing in its path. As in Predator, the comparison between alien and humanity at its worst is always underscored. In Prey, Naru comes across an entire herd of buffalo slaughtered and skinned, rotting in the sun, and her assumption is that the alien is to blame. But it turns out to be the work of the French trappers on a gratuitous killing spree.\n\nThe alien's chilling imitative tendencies further blurs the alien-vs-human line. In Predator, the most disturbing instance of this is the uncanny moment when the dying alien speaks for the first time, echoing back to his killer, the last man standing (Arnold Schwarzenegger), his own incredulous line: \"What the hell are you?\"\n\nBut the alien can also imitate and make deadlier any human tool, so he's soon fighting with high-tech versions of spears, arrows, and his own invention, a bladed shield also used as a throwing device. In the Predator series, we're up against a kind of futuristic hybrid version of ourselves.\n\nPredator offered up an anti-macho take during the 1980s, the most macho era of the action film, when a cartoonishly over-muscled hero played by Schwarzenegger, or Sylvester Stallone, or Dolph Lundgren, was always bestriding the cinema like a Colossus. In the opening sequence of Predator , a helicopter-load of despicable gym-built military braggarts, toting assault rifles and flexing their biceps and feeling impervious to danger, get dropped into a jungle where they're soon reduced to silent, gaping terror against a far superior foe. It's a satisfying development to watch.\n\n(The Alien series of 1979 to the present, offered an even better corrective, with its quietly formidable heroine Ripley [Sigourney Weaver] in the first film, and the sequel, Aliens [1986], featuring Bill Paxton giving one of his great performances as the supposed ultra-tough guy reduced to shrill hysteria, yelling the immortal line, \"Game over, man! Game over!\")\n\nPrey follows out this resistant strand of logic in the franchise by making the young, overpraised male warriors inclined toward strutting, bragging, and a fatal lack of attention paid to unforeseen new enemies in their territory. This leaves one determined but inexperienced warrior-hunter Comanche girl and her dog as the apparently overmatched protagonists.\n\nIt works beautifully. For once, I'm looking forward to the inevitable sequels.\n\nEileen Jones is a film critic at Jacobin and author of Filmsuck, USA .

Reynolds makes a powerful argument for recognizing Aboriginal sovereignty.\n\nJimmy Clements (c. 1847-1927) was an Aboriginal elder from the Wiradjuri tribe in New South Wales.

The statement demands the Australian government to amend its constitution to mandate an indigenous voice in parliament. It also calls for a truth and reconciliation process, and a negotiated treaty between Australia and its First Nations. Although the former Liberal PM Malcolm Turnbull rejected the statement, it has since garnered public support.\n\nReynolds also responds to intellectuals and historians associated with the Australian right, who, following former PM John Howard, attacked what they called the \"black armband\" school of history. These conservative historians proposed that we should not judge Australia's colonial settlers retrospectively, but rather understand them in light of their contemporary values and laws.\n\nThis is precisely what the first part of Reynolds's book does. Truth-Telling not only builds on the Uluru Statement by making a powerful case for retrospectively respecting Aboriginal sovereignty. It also demonstrates that even by their own eighteenth- and nineteenth-century standards, Australia's colonizers were criminals.\n\nIn their quest to build a national mythology, right-wing historians have downplayed the genocide committed against indigenous Australians. The second part of the Truth-Telling sets the record straight, debunking the lies that have justified colonization and genocide, beginning with the notion that this was an uninhabited land.\n\nAs Reynolds recounts, when Captain James Cook laid claim to the eastern half of the continent, he contradicted official instructions to take possession only of \"convenient situations,\" with the consent of the natives. British sovereignty justified itself with the legal notion of terra nullius , that is, \"nobody's land.\" Seeking to reassure the British government, Joseph Banks, the botanist on Cook's voyage, claimed that New South Wales (NSW) was sparsely populated by people with no sovereignty. He reported that its inhabitants lived a \"mere animal existence,\" mainly on the coast, and would soon abandon their lands to the Europeans.\n\nAs Reynolds demonstrates, first contact between British settlers and First Nations peoples contradicted this fantasy. When Arthur Phillip and the First Fleet arrived, they encountered tribal groups with distinct boundaries, languages and customs. Far from abandoning their lands, indigenous peoples fought for their sovereignty, pushing back against encroachments, and asserting their rights.\n\nAs a result, from the beginning, there was a contradiction in British attitudes toward First Nations people in Australia. They incoherently deemed them both as British subjects (and entitled to the protection of British law) and as enemy combatants.\n\nReynolds's work highlights indigenous resistance, not as some kind of \"instinctive reaction,\" but as a just war against invaders. This war of resistance began early. In 1790, two years after the British established the first European settlement at Sydney cove, Pemulwuy, an Eora man, speared and mortally wounded Philip John McEntire, the convict gamekeeper to Arthur Philip. Pemulwuy went on to lead a twelve-year guerrilla campaign against the colonizers.\n\nAs First Nations peoples defended themselves, early NSW governors such as Phillip and Lachlan Macquarie sent detachments to \"strike terror\" among resisting tribes. Because the Aboriginal nations of Australia were autonomous, the pacification of one region had little bearing on others. Consequently, as settlers moved from Sydney to the hinterland, they escalated their violence against people they theoretically considered British subjects. This was how the frontier wars began.\n\nReynolds is at his most insightful when showing that, far from bringing the \"rule of law,\" the First Fleet initiated a violent campaign of expropriation against those labeled recalcitrant to \"civilization.\"\n\nIn particular, he demonstrates the link between personal enrichment and colonization that drove the frontier wars. With little to no accountability, the colonial settlers waged war against indigenous peoples in order to expand their landholdings and profits. This process was so violent that the British authorities were, at times, uncomfortable with its extremes. Nevertheless, the British did little to restrain the colonial logic they had set in motion.\n\nDescribing this is an important part of the truth-telling called for by the Uluru Statement of the Heart . It's also key to debunking conservative historians. For example, Reynolds notes that colonial-era newspapers, books, and articles were surprisingly open about the mass killings of Aboriginal people. They even hosted debates as to the necessity of extermination. As the pioneer Edward Curr wrote in 1886:\n\nIn districts which are not easily traversed on horseback, in which Whites are few in number and food is procurable by the Blacks in fastnesses, the term [of warfare and bloodshed] is usually prolonged and the slaughter . . . considerable.\n\nThis is significant given Australia's subsequent silence about these killings. A social Darwinism that regarded Aboriginal people as an inferior and declining race was the ideological justification for genocide.\n\nThe colonizers further justified their actions with the claim that nomadic tribes without agriculture should cede their land to settlers who would use it more productively. Ignoring indigenous land management and agriculture, European colonizers instituted a system of pastoral leases granting settlers the right to drive off Aboriginal \"trespassers.\"\n\nAs Reynolds notes, the British government had qualms about the brutality of this process, particularly in Port Phillip. Consequently, they inserted indigenous usage rights into these pastoral leases. Across the continent, settler governments ignored these rights, or remained ignorant of them, until the landmark 1992 Mabo High Court decision resurrected them, granting indigenous Australians the ability to claim limited land rights.\n\nBritish authorities devolved legal responsibility over indigenous peoples to the colonies in the 1850s, driving a particularly brutal phase in the frontier wars in the north of the continent. Although a new land bill passed in 1860 expanded settlement in Queensland, Europeans continued to be vastly outnumbered by First Nations peoples. Indeed, there were large areas of the north where Aboriginal life - and sovereignty - had continued undisturbed.\n\nSettlers in Queensland in particular were unencumbered by humanitarian concerns. This moral indifference, combined with the increasing sophistication of European weaponry in the latter half of the nineteenth century, made colonization in these areas especially brutal. Reynolds highlights the use of native police - paramilitary units of Aboriginal troopers led by white officers that operated in secret to ruthlessly \"disperse\" groups of Aboriginal men, women, and children.\n\nFor Reynolds, the existence of the native police points to a complexity that must be part of truth-telling. At times, Aboriginal people were themselves coerced into aiding this expansion of \"civilization.\"\n\nBut Reynolds also points to the bravery and heroism of indigenous fighters. He identifies some dissenting news reports that recognized indigenous warriors as engaged in a just defense of their homelands. He notes an article in a Launceston newspaper by an author named \"J. E.\" who stated the following:\n\nWhat we call their crime is what in a white man we should call patriotism. Where is the man amongst ourselves who would not resist an invading enemy; who would not avenge the murder of his parents, the ill-usage of his wife and daughters, the spoliation of all his earthly goods, by a foreign enemy, if he had the opportunity?\n\nRecognizing Aboriginal warriors as patriots defending their nations can strengthen an argument for indigenous sovereignty. Reynolds drives home his point in arguing that institutions such as the Australian War Memorial should commemorate indigenous combatants and the hundred thousand indigenous dead as combatants in a colonial war.\n\nDespite its many strengths, Truth-Telling suffers from a lack of analysis of colonial settler capitalism. Ultimately, settlers drove Aboriginal people from the land to commodify it and generate market profits through grazing and agriculture. This helps to explain the legal frameworks that governed settlement. It also undermines Reynolds's view that better laws (or a more consistent application of existing ones) would have lessened the impact of colonization.\n\nFor example, Reynolds compares Australia unfavorably to other settler colonies in North America. When he refers approvingly to Canada's stronger native title provisions, Reynolds implies a certain disregard for the logic of settler colonialism in general.\n\nThis is apparent when he turns to the question of whether an alternative was possible. When the colony of South Australia was legally established in 1834, Reynolds notes that the Colonial Office, under a reformist British parliament, raised doubts about British sovereignty over Australia's interior. However, the problem wasn't an ill-conceived understanding of indigenous sovereignty.\n\nBy establishing colonial settler states, the British had unleashed a genocidal logic. It's hard to see how recognizing indigenous sovereignty would have restrained this. As Reynolds himself notes, British misgivings were quickly overridden when overlanders and squatters arriving from New South Wales brought the brutality of the frontier wars to South Australia.\n\nThe first section of Truth-Telling closes with a long discussion of treaties, which Reynolds believes could have forestalled much of the violence. Reynolds condemns the British for turning their back on a tradition of treaty-making developed in North America and elsewhere. In his view, treaties between sovereign indigenous nations and the new Australian colonies might have provided a degree of mutual respect, restraining settler violence and securing land usage rights for Aboriginal people.\n\nLeaving aside the importance of demanding a treaty between Australia and its First Nations today, a wider view of settler colonial capitalism undermines Reynolds's case for historic treaties. In practice, treaties between very unequal powers rely solely on the goodwill of the stronger power.\n\nPerhaps treaties might have lessened the degree of cultural loss. But it's just as important to recognize that settlers have historically used treaties as a tool of dispossession. United States and Canadian history is littered with broken and coerced treaties that saw Native Americans surrender their land only to be pushed by colonizers into impoverished reserves at great loss of life and culture.\n\nDespite the controversy surrounding it, Bruce Pascoe's Dark Emu has led to a widespread reconsideration of Aboriginal people's agricultural practices prior to invasion. This has bolstered support for indigenous land rights. Truth-Telling sets out to provoke a similar rethinking of the political organization and sovereignty of Australia's First Nations peoples. Reynolds makes his case particularly powerful by placing indigenous resistance front and center, suggesting it should be understood as a patriotic defense of their homelands.\n\nThe timing is important, too. Although the Australian government enshrined limited land rights through the Mabo decision in 1992, Aboriginal people still experience deep poverty, racism, and dispossession. Aboriginal people face far higher rates of death in custody , and their culture is regularly destroyed with impunity .\n\nAustralia's shift away from a pastoral economy and toward mining has not halted the destruction of Aboriginal lands . At the same time, the movement for Aboriginal sovereignty has grown, with historically significant Invasion Day protests every year.\n\nBy powerfully confirming the positions taken by the Uluru Statement from the Heart, Henry Reynolds, has also highlighted the need to push further. Truth-telling is a precondition for genuine justice. But a complete act of truth-telling would also require holding Australian settler colonialism fully to account.\n\nFor nonindigenous Australia, a change of heart, of consciousness and of understanding is necessary, of course. But empathy won't be enough to redress such a vast historic wrong.\n\nIt's a worthwhile goal to pressure the Australian War Memorial to commemorate Aboriginal people who died in the frontiers war. And constitutional recognition of indigenous peoples may be a step forward. But without deeper, structural change, they are likely to be cosmetic changes only.\n\nIndeed, Truth-Telling 's account of genocide and Aboriginal sovereignty raises the questions of reparations and decolonization. It doesn't just indict colonial-era Australia - it strikes at the heart of contemporary Australia, a state whose logic is still premised on European colonial settler capitalism.\n\nGary Pearce has written for publications such as Overland , the Drum , Eureka Street , Arena Magazine and Thesis Eleven .

      "text": "Dear White People: Here's How to Honor Native Americans\n\nChiricahua Apache children at the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in 1885 Library of Congress\n\nNovember is my annual season of ambivalence. Although I love autumn, its poignant air of loss and the promise of renewal, it has the bittersweet distinction of also being Native American history month.\n\nEvery year, for as long as I can remember, editors of the legacy press, as well as church and school groups, have asked me to regale their audiences with Native American history. Inevitably these requests seek to frame Indigenous peoples as denizens of a long-ago past, as occupants of a fantasy world that has almost nothing to do with our lived experiences.\n\nThis annual exercise has taken on a wearying sameness: It's the month of explaining Indians to white people. Typically they tell me they want to know more about Native people, our lives today, how to honor our culture and be allies. But almost always this means they want me to present generic versions of Native dance, crafts, spirituality; to help them participate in ceremonies and drumming, identify their power animals, and become shamans. In short, they want to celebrate an Indian who never was, one who soothes their settler souls.\n\nI often relent and offer up a few words encouraging folks to read pertinent books and conduct a bit of research on their own. Such presentations are far more mindful of white fragility than I'd prefer. Nevertheless, what I say can be shattering to them, like watching a 5-year-old's face crumble as she's told Santa Claus isn't real.\n\nThis year, the requests have been especially fraught. Prompted by discoveries of hundreds of children's graves at the boarding schools that Native children were coerced into by the governments of Canada and the United States, white people want me to describe these atrocities and my own family's experience as survivors. For reasons that are difficult for me to fathom, this is a new story for White America. They are shocked, horrified, and weirdly eager for appalling details.\n\nNative people, myself included, are shocked that it's taken so long for non-Natives to acknowledge this grim history, one we've been hollering about for decades, only to be met with deafening silence or denial.\n\nMy grandmother, mother, aunts and uncles, and many cousins are all boarding school survivors. Theirs was run by the Catholic church, but its curriculum and culture were modeled on federal schools such as the Carlisle Indian Industrial School, which also inspired those in Canada where the bodies of children were first disinterred in June.\n\nAfter Canada passed the Indian Act in 1876, which authorized the government to regulate and administer the affairs of Indigenous peoples, Nicholas Flood Davin, a member of Parliament, was tasked with finding a means to educate the country's Indigenous peoples. Davin visited the Carlisle Indian Industrial School in 1879 and was impressed with how US Army Lt. Richard Pratt, the school's founder, used education to force assimilation onto Native people.\n\nBefore founding Carlisle, Pratt ran a prison school for Natives at Fort Marion in Florida, where he developed a pedagogical style of systematically destroying Native culture, language, and family connections with the goal of absorbing Native children into mainstream America. His motto, \" Kill the Indian, save the man ,\" helped shape the regimented military style that defined most Native boarding schools.\n\nUS boarding schools were often woefully underfunded. Deplorable conditions-poor food, clothing, housing-contributed to the spread of disease and sometimes death. According to researchers, many schools failed to keep accurate records of student deaths. Parents of those who died were often notified after the child's burial, if they were notified at all; few could afford travel expenses to pick up their children's remains.\n\nUnlike Canada, where the 2008 Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement and subsequent Truth and Reconciliation Act helped unlock church and government records, there is little definitive data on the number of schools or children who attended or died at schools in the United States. Researchers estimate that more than twice as many Indian boarding schools operated in the United States as in Canada.\n\nInterior Secretary Deb Haaland, the only Indigenous person to serve at the Cabinet level, recently announced her agency's creation of the Federal Indian Boarding School Truth Initiative. Under the initiative, the Bureau of Indian Affairs is instructed to collect records of the boarding school program, with special attention to deaths and burial sites. The initiative also includes securing documentation from Christian denominations that operated schools.\n\nHaaland's initiative represents the first official effort to own up to the boarding school era and recognize its enduring impact on Native peoples. It's also the first concrete commitment by the US government to investigate and acknowledge the history of assimilationist policies.\n\n\"For more than a century, the Department was responsible for operating or overseeing Indian boarding schools across the U.S.,\" the initiative states. \"While it may be difficult to learn of the traumas suffered in the boarding school era, understanding its impacts on communities today cannot occur without acknowledging that painful history.\"\n\n\"Only by acknowledging the past can we work toward a future we are all proud to embrace.\"\n\nBut as of yet, it's pretty vague. There are no specific plans to perform archeological investigations of boarding school sites, nor is there any funding appropriated. And, crucially, the United States has never apologized for its boarding school policies.\n\nThe enormity of my family's trauma is simply too deep to be reduced to the indignity of a benign synopsis offered to a gathering of blissfully ignorant and well-intentioned, always well-intentioned, White people. In the end, those intentions remain firmly centered in a White world where White saviors pave the way for healing and reconciliation on terms that don't look too deeply into their own culpability and benefits associated with colonialism.\n\nThere is a childlike quality to the White fragility and entitlement, even among the most woke persons, that almost fills me with pity. Until I remember how much power they hold and how, if they really wanted, they could make an enormous difference in the world.\n\nFor this year's Native American history month, therefore, I have a modest proposal. Help us bring out our dead.\n\nA bill establishing the Truth and Healing Commission on Indian Boarding School Policy in the U.S. Act was introduced in Congress again this year. It would compel the investigation of America's boarding school history and actions to address the policy's intergenerational impact.\n\nBut rather than waiting for lawmakers to rule, churches, universities, and communities who truly want to be allies can support Indigenous efforts to locate boarding schools and cemeteries. Guided entirely by Indigenous peoples, allies can pay for all costs associated with this work-be it disinterring remains and repatriating them to their homes, building memorials, or holding ceremonies to honor the dead.\n\nAllies can do this work without centering themselves in any way. They can facilitate healing and reconciliation by simply being of service to their Indigenous neighbors. The Genoa Indian School Digital Reconciliation Project -a collaboration between the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, the Genoa Foundation, and members of Nebraska tribes, including descendants of those sent to that boarding school-is a great model. By combing through newspaper archives and school newsletters, the project has identified more than 100 children who died at the school and is working to locate their graves.\n\nAlthough not nearly as entertaining as learning how to be a shaman or reading aloud land acknowledgements in suitably lofty tones, a nationwide effort to find all the graves at all the schools would represent authentic reckoning. It's a Native American history month activity I could support wholeheartedly and without rancor, one that might represent a true step forward.\n\nAdapted in part from \"We Won't Forget About the Children\" in Indian Country Today , where Mary Annette Pember is a national correspondent.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Native American Lives Are Tragic, But Probably Not in the Way You Think\n\nTerese Mailhot November/December 2018 Issue\n\n\"Healing requires acknowledgement,\" says Lisa Schrader, a student at St. Joe's Indian School and Red Cloud Indian School in the 1970s and early 1980s. \"And when we were taken away from our homes and we lost our language, and we lost our culture, and we lost our identity, no one ever told us, 'Welcome home. I'm glad you made it back.'\"\n\nDaniella Zalcman\n\nBack in June, activist Shaun King tweeted out a colleague's Intercept story to his million-­plus followers: \"All over this country, for decades on end now, indigenous women have gone missing at an alarming rate,\" he wrote. \"Authorities are just now truly acknowledging the crisis.\" I remembered then to ask around the rez whether Roberta was still missing.\n\nRoberta, whose name I have changed to protect her privacy, is from my reserve on British Columbia's Seabird Island. It's a small community, and it only took a few Facebook messages to learn she'd been spotted at a 7-Eleven. I'd seen her myself a few months earlier, and she wasn't looking well. When I was young I used to babysit for a friend of hers, and I still remember how hard they partied. Someone close to Roberta told me she had been trying to stay in recovery-she was \"lost but not lost.\" Just putting this to paper perpetuates a negative stereotype: We're doing this to ourselves.\n\nIn March, Roberta had posted on Facebook, \"Do you believe in me? acknokwledge me please.\" She was reported missing April 13, and for weeks I would stare at her profile picture, then at her \"missing person\" photo. She eventually re­surfaced. Then a woman from my father's nearby reserve went missing. Her name is Shawnee and she's 29 years old.\n\nNative people are familiar with brutality, with our histories. We bear witness firsthand, and then again via media reports articulating how bad we have it- if they notice us at all . It seems like all I see in my news feed are missing-persons photos and stories about racism against us. I empathize with Roberta's circumstances. I think it's easy to fall in a hole where I'm from, easy to give up hope. People will be mad at me for saying that.\n\nMy friend Tommy Orange begins his debut novel, There There , with a prologue about the circumstances Native Americans once faced-the brutal truth: \"Some of us grew up with stories about massacres. Stories about what happened to our people not so long ago.\" He describes how white people tore unborn babies from our bodies. How they danced with our dismembered parts and displayed our heads in jars. A Globe and Mail reviewer warned that his novel could be weaponized: \"I found myself wondering how non-Indigenous people would read this book,\" she wrote, \"and whether they would interpret it to reinforce their stereotypes of Indigenous people.\" But I don't know how we can be artists if we're worried about what white people will think of us.\n\nI believe all good stories are tragedies. I also realize outsiders see our plight differently. They see it as voyeurs, hoping to affirm something in themselves: that we are braves humiliated, or wild savages from a lost time, people who were ravaged, and what is left is only a mirror of what's been done, a vessel for a white person's imagination.\n\nThe tropes are porous and easy to get lost in. Last year, the Native American Journalists Association and High Country News issued a bingo board designed \"to catch overused and hackneyed ideas employed by newsrooms\"-alcohol, poverty, \"vanishing culture,\" \"dying language.\" This may be helpful for reporters, but what of us Native authors and artists who want to express the truth of our lives, which are sometimes affected by, yes, poverty and alcohol? These conditions are not unique to Native people, of course, but when they are applied to us it feels definitive.\n\nNo matter what we write, white people can turn our stories into weapons, an excuse to be paternalistic. If we depict ourselves as educated and self-­sufficient, they might advance the narrative that our tragedies are long past, that we should dust ourselves off and move on. If we are portrayed as poor or dysfunctional or prone to alcoholism, they can use that to take away services or argue that we game the system. No matter what we do, we're still Indian, and often we don't get to speak for ourselves.\n\n\"You have no time to think for yourself,\" says Bessie Randolph, who attended Albuquerque Indian School from 1952 to 1962. \"Wake up at 5:30, clean the building and make the beds, breakfast from 6 to 7, report to the school building at 8, lunch at 12, out of school at 4, dinner at 5:30, asleep by 8. Ten years of following that routine and we didn't know how to live like real people. We were told when and how to do everything. How do you apply for a job? How do you use the telephone? Are you supposed to go to college? We left school completely lost.\"\n\nDaniella Zalcman\n\nI grew up thinking about the tragedy of my history. Elders used to say we were stewards of the Earth, close to creation, divine in intellect and body, and living in abundance like Adam and Eve before the fall, before \"contact\"-a strangely puritanical ideology, no doubt violently ingrained in us by Christian influence; call that a tragedy, too. There's plenty of content about our misfortune now. Search YouTube and you can find a \"drunk Native\" subgenre-dozens of videos of our people, obliterated by drink, speaking nonsensically or fighting in the street. Some of the titles include the word \"funny.\"\n\nIt wasn't until graduate school that I heard the term \"poverty porn\" and realized non-Natives were titillated by our misfortunes, and that indigenous people were consuming it too, albeit for different reasons. Maybe, like me, they were just happy to be seen, finally-not as mascots or advertising icons or mystic ghosts, but as people, alive and still struggling in the aftermath of colonization.\n\nAnother friend, Blackfeet writer Sterling HolyWhiteMountain, wrote on social media this year that \"1 in 3 Native Americans will be assaulted by statistics in their lifetime.\" It's the kind of joke we sometimes use to flick at stark truths: More than one-quarter of Native Americans live in povert y. The latest numbers show roughly 1 in 5 lacking health insurance-8 percent are jobless. Gross underfunding of Native health care has resulted in life expectancies that are, in some states, about a decade shorter than the national average. A staggering 60 percent of children on Canadian reservations are impoverished. Native women are raped and assaulted at higher rates than any other group. The numbers go on to show, from every angle, a gap in service, a grave injustice. The statistics are burdensome but a little redemptive. They prove we aren't crazy for thinking our communities face disparities most couldn't imagine, a violence most cannot see.\n\nI resist an identity fixed in grief, but I welcome tragedy. To me the word is pregnant with meaning. I don't mind a tragic life in which there is a magnitude to my character, my loss, and it is all toward some end-a denouement.\n\nIn my kitchen hangs a print my father made. He abused my mother, my sisters and brothers, and me and then left when I was six. He was a drunk. He didn't have a home. The only good parts of him were his artwork, exquisitely symmetrical and Salish, experimental with form and color. I don't know why I keep the print on my wall. Tragedy, I think. I want to see the human in the work.\n\nAcross the house, my first book is displayed on our mantel. Sherman Alexie wrote the introduction. Then he was accused of sexually harassing and assaulting Native women . (He later apologized vaguely and said he did not recall physically or verbally threatening anybody.) Now I can't look at my book without knowing that, even in triumph, I can't escape the statistics, the violence surrounding Native women.\n\nOreos Eriacho spent the entire 1960s at Ramah Elementary School and Ramah Dormitory. \"Your spirit is kind of broken when you're told you're not supposed to act like a Native American,\" he now says. \"We've lost our identity-my kids ask me who we are and I have nothing to give them. But I'm teaching my daughters how to hunt, how to cut up the meat, how to use plants. I hope it helps.\"\n\nDaniella Zalcman\n\nBut I am not a hopeless illustration, something for non-Natives to witness. This world is larger for us in it, because we saw things the white settlers didn't-we had maps and taxonomy, an interior knowledge of the Earth that our colonizers willfully tried to erase and negate. Amid the land allotments and limitations and government schools aimed at molding Native children, as one historian put it, \" in the image of White America ,\" we see the histories forgotten, the matrilineal societies, confederacies and prophets, infighting and clans, and stories the world is richer for. We discovered medicines, saved lives, and carried things we still hold in our minds. Thanks to secret knowledge and secret ceremonies, at least some of our cultures and people survived genocides. I feel we are failing when we allow the majority culture to burden us with its binaries: left behind or assimilated, saints or heathens, savages or healers, warriors or drunks. I don't know what to do with my definition of tragedy in the face of theirs. But I think the answer is always story. The duplicities in our identities as indigenous people are key.\n\nAt a Naval Academy graduation in May, President Donald Trump told cadets , \"We are not going to apologize for America,\" and he claimed the nation's ancestors had \"tamed a continent\"-as if those who came before were savage. Where my people are from, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is fighting with First Nations people who oppose a pipeline expansion that would triple the amount of tar sands oil shipped from Alberta to the coast of British Columbia.\n\nMy family now lives in Indiana (\"Land of the Indians\"), where my son was told by his middle-school bully that America is for whites only and Indians are dirty. They said the same to me, I told him, and to my mother when she was a kid-except they threw rocks at her when she walked into town, and my grandmother experienced worse. I wanted him to know things aren't so bad as they used to be, but that they won't get better anytime soon. The age of Trumpism seems hell-bent on walking back progress to a time when white people enjoyed the benefit of even more brutal and explicit discrimination than they do today. I acknowledged the way defeat is useless, and hope might be, too. By the end of the day I had no conclusions to make-he went back to class.\n\nI used to fight for awareness only to realize that once a system, a friend, or a teacher learned of our circumstances, they leveraged it as proof they should be paternal, or they did nothing but pity us and revel in that pity. For much of my life, outsiders have been telling me how sorry they are about what happened to Indians, or telling me to get over it. I'm hypervigilant about how I talk about myself and my people because we aren't a monolith, and while pity can feel like empathy or kindness, it's ultimately of no use.\n\nTommy Orange and I are close, personally and professionally. Together we went from poor to secure, grad students to teachers, unknown to critically acclaimed. So I messaged him to get his take on all this. He replied that he thinks most Indians don't view themselves as mired in tragic circumstances: \"We become what we most don't want to become, and sometimes that is tragic. I think we should resist pity, and monolithic, static thinking regarding who we are and what we're about. Tragedy is unavoidable for humanity. I just always hope it's balanced with humor. I think of life as a tragicomedy.\"\n\nTommy is right. I've heard Natives, academics, and people on Twitter extolling joyous indigenous futures. But I like joy that's earned, because what good is it without the threat it can be taken away? The symmetry of the Salish artwork I grew up around beckons me to consider the whole story. My father's work redeemed him in the eyes of some people-it complicated him for me, which is what good art does. I don't want a joyous future nearly as much as I want the freedom to present the tragedy in our lives-and not be bound to it. ____\n\nIn the 1880s, the newly formed Canadian government built a network of residential schools intended to assimilate indigenous children. \" Signs of Your Identity ,\" a project of photographer Daniella Zalcman that was funded by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, features multi-exposure portraits of former students still plagued by memories of those forced family separations.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "How Native Tribes Started Winning at the Supreme Court\n\nMother Jones illustration; Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post/Getty, Liu Jie/Xinhua/Getty\n\nOn a September morning in 2001, Native American leaders from across the country convened in a ballroom at the Grand Hyatt in Washington, DC, to talk strategy. The Supreme Court was escalating a destructive war on tribal sovereignty, weakening the power of Indigenous nations to protect their people and lands. As the meeting opened, Sen. Daniel Inouye of Hawaii took the podium and stunned everyone with the news that two planes had just hit the twin towers of the World Trade Center. The meeting's 300 attendees flocked to the lobby to watch live coverage of the attacks.\n\nLess than one hour later, some esteemed tribal leaders called for the meeting to continue as planned. \"What's happened is awful,\" lawyer Riyaz Kanji recalls them saying. \"But we came here from all around the country to address some big issues. So let's get to work.\"\n\nTheir willingness to proceed testified to the urgency of their task. Though federal policies were slowly becoming more supportive of Native peoples, the Supreme Court had delivered two decades' worth of judgments limiting their progress. In 2002, legal scholar David Getches \"found that convicted criminals won 34 percent of the time while Indian tribes have won only 23 percent of the time.\" He added, \"Nobody does worse in this Supreme Court than Indian tribes.\" After 2000 brought particularly brutal rulings over taxation and jurisdiction issues, tribal leaders and lawyers decided they needed a new approach. Thus, on September 11, 2001, they formed the Tribal Supreme Court Project-and their luck began to change.\n\nThe project was instrumental in securing last month's victory in one of the most important tribal cases of the past century. In McGirt v. Oklahoma , the Supreme Court found three million acres of eastern Oklahoma still belong to the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, at least for jurisdictional purposes, with likely implications for four other tribes and much of the state's land. In a majority opinion that evoked strong emotions throughout Indian Country, Justice Neil Gorsuch-a Trump appointee-suggested that the court has a duty to hold the US government to its oft-broken promises to tribes, marking the fourth consecutive ruling in favor of Natives' treaty rights. This may be the dawn of a new judicial era , catalyzed by the Tribal Supreme Court Project and by new justices whose opinions reflect an evolving understanding of Indian law and history.\n\nFederal courts play a much larger role in the lives of Native Americans than most people's, says Elizabeth Kronk Warner, citizen of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians and dean of the law school at University of Utah. That's because \"Indian\" is technically not a racial identity but rather a legal designation. \"It's by virtue of my political relationship with my tribe that I also have a special relationship with the federal government,\" she says. For tribal members, \"everyday issues\" like hunting rights and land ownership \"become questions of federal law,\" specifically a long-neglected branch of it called \"Indian law.\"\n\nUnder Indian law, crimes committed by Indians on reservations must be tried in federal court if they are felonies or involve non-Indian victims . This was at issue in McGirt v. Oklahoma : A Seminole man named Jimcy McGirt was sentenced to life by the state of Oklahoma for committing sex crimes against a child in 1996. Yet the felony happened on lands that Congress designated as the Muscogee (Creek) reservation after having removed the Muscogee from their southeastern homelands during the \"Trail of Tears\" in the 1830s.\n\nLater, after encouraging white settlers to purchase much of the land promised to the Muscogee and four other tribes, both Congress and the state of Oklahoma ceased to recognize the original reservation boundaries. Yet the Supreme Court held last month that Congress never officially disestablished the Muscogee reservation, which could in turn mean that all five reservations-making up almost half the state-are still part of \"Indian Country,\" a patchwork of Native communities across the US where state laws rarely apply. Jimcy McGirt, and dozens of tribal citizens in similar situations, should have been tried in federal court.\n\nThey may now be retried, thanks to the efforts of McGirt's lawyer Ian Gershengorn, Riyaz Kanji (who argued on behalf of the Muscogee), and others connected to the Tribal Supreme Court Project, a nationwide brain trust of more than 300 attorneys and scholars who collaborate to boost tribes' arguments before the Supreme Court. It was formed out of a sense that the highest court in the land, a sometime ally of tribes throughout history, was turning sour on tribal sovereignty. John Echo-Hawk, founder of the Native American Rights Fund (NARF), was echoing a common sentiment when he declared in 2001, \"There's a crisis in Indian Country, and it's called the US Supreme Court.\"\n\nSince then, the Tribal Supreme Court Project has monitored 400 Indian law cases as they made their way through the courts, watching those likely to reach the Supreme Court and inviting their network to collaborate on petitions, arguments, and representation for the more than 150 that have. Spreadsheets are updated and shared by Joel West Williams, a Cherokee attorney who leads the initiative for NARF, which along with the National Congress of American Indians has anchored the Tribal Supreme Court Project from the start. In that time, says Williams, \"the quality of tribal advocacy at the court has substantially improved,\" not just with regard to representation but \"the whole package of court presentation.\"\n\nWithin two days of the Supreme Court agreeing to review the McGirt case, Williams was on a call with Kanji to plan a strategy around amicus briefs, the written arguments filed by outside parties interested in a case. Kanji knew from his time clerking for David Souter, in 1994, that Supreme Court justices have neither the obligation nor the time to read every brief that's filed. He suggested the project focus on coordinating a limited lineup of briefs that clarify key issues, written by people of interest to the court (rather than piling on the briefs ad hoc over time). For McGirt , they recruited former US attorneys to file briefs challenging Oklahoma's argument that redrawing the jurisdictional lines would create legal turmoil, and they found state elected officials to write about the high degree of existing cooperation between Oklahoma and tribes.\n\nWilliams invited everyone on the project's email list to a call, soliciting feedback from anyone interested-which, given McGirt' s potential implications for all tribes, was an extra large group. \"The project has become a clearinghouse for information,\" says Kanji, an immigrant from Uganda who has devoted hundreds of pro bono hours to the project. When the lead attorneys needed more evidence of the US \"crushing tribal reservations,\" they quickly accumulated examples from across the country. \"It's a very inclusive approach,\" says Williams.\n\nThe Tribal Supreme Court Project was inspired by a similar initiative by the National Association of Attorneys General, which began coordinating efforts to defend states before the court in 1982, as Reagan's \"New Federalism\" devolved regulatory powers to states and exposed them to more litigation . Yet despite the groundbreaking intertribal collaboration, the Indigenous project has only begun to win consistently in the past five years, since the arrival of Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Gorsuch. Before that, the court had already flip-flopped several times in its approach to tribal issues.\n\nIndian law as we know it dates back to the 1820s, when then-Chief Justice John Marshall authored the first of three landmark Supreme Court decisions known as the \"Marshall Trilogy.\" These rulings, two of which involved the Cherokee Nation in the lead-up to the Trail of Tears, established the federal government's primacy over states in dealing with Indigenous nations, who Marshall said had a sovereign right to manage their own affairs.\n\nTheir newly recognized sovereignty was soon crushed when President Andrew Jackson pushed forward with a program of forced removal, kicking off a century in which Indian policy shifted toward conquest, land grabs, and annihilation. The Supreme Court began following Congress' and the executive's lead, says Dylan Hedden-Nicely, a citizen of Cherokee Nation and law professor at the University of Idaho. The turning point was United States v. Kagama , which in 1886 held that the federal government could prosecute major crimes committed by one Indian against another, diminishing tribes' sovereign right to govern their own citizens.\n\nThe Supreme Court's last swing in favor of tribes came during the civil rights movement of the 1960s-the era of the American Indian Movement and the Alcatraz occupation (pictured above). AP photo \"Indian tribes are the wards of the nation,\" wrote Justice Samuel Miller in that majority opinion , which Hedden-Nicely says \"acknowledged the sovereignty framework laid out by John Marshall, but at the same time essentially said, 'It doesn't apply anymore.'\" From that point on, Hedden-Nicely argues, the court had two conflicting sets of precedents it could follow. In deciding a case, it would choose one or the other to justify its desired outcome-generally, the one least detrimental to non-Indians. \"Rather than using baseline rules and applying them without bias, the court has been weighing tribes' rights against how they would affect the lives of non-Native people,\" he says. This created a \"whipsaw effect\": As successive waves of federal officials tried to weaken tribes, then build them up, then \"terminate\" their special status, the court followed, hewing back and forth. The legal standing of tribes was always shifting, inhibiting their economic development. Prior to this past decade, the court's last swing in favor of tribes came during the civil rights movement of the 1960s, when the American Indian Movement and Alcatraz occupation won federal self-determination policies that gave tribes increasing control over federal lands, funds, and programs. Justice Thurgood Marshall took special interest in Indian law and wrote opinions attempting to fortify it . In Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez , his majority opinion advanced the idea that tribes, who pre-date the US Constitution, were not bound by all its limitations on statutory power. In the landmark Oliphant case, he argued in his dissent that tribes should be able to prosecute non-Indians on their reservations as a matter of tribal sovereignty. With the Indian Regulatory Gambling Act of 1988, money began rolling into tribes that could be spent on more and better lawyers. This was good timing. Under new Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the court was adopting a \"colorblind justice\" approach to questions of tribal rights, chipping away at Native sovereignty. Which brings us to 2000, when the project arose after two devastating decisions. One barred tribes from taxing non-Indian businesses on their reservations; the other limited their jurisdiction over Indian lands held in federal trust. In both unanimous rulings, Justices Ruth Bader Ginsberg and Sandra Day O'Connor joined Rehnquist, Clarence Thomas, and Antonin Scalia. Positions on Indian law, still largely opaque even to Supreme Court justices, rarely follow neat ideological lines. Tribal advocates are not surprised that Gorsuch, a conservative Trump appointee, has consistently favored tribes. Previously appointed by President George W. Bush to the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers Colorado, Kansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Utah, and Wyoming, Gorsuch adjudicated many tribal cases and developed an understanding of Indian law commended by Native leaders. Like fellow Westerner Sandra Day O'Connor, Gorsuch met and dialogued with tribal lawyers outside the courtroom. While his \"textualist\" approach might be reactionary on reproductive freedoms or gun laws, Indian law scholars say it provides a strong basis for upholding the rights and reservations promised to tribes in treaties. \"We'll be quoting passages in [Gorsuch's McGirt ] opinion for the rest of our lives,\" Kanji says. In his ruling, Gorsuch argues that the court shouldn't ratify \"the rule of the strong\" over \"the rule of law\": Treaty promises can't be nullified through conflicts or swindles but only by explicit acts of Congress. Similar principles were affirmed in last year's decision interpreting the Yakama Nation Treaty of 1855 as exempting its reservation from a fuel tax, and another that supported the Crow Tribe's right to hunt on federal lands. In 2018, Washington v. United States upheld a lower court decision requiring the state of Washington to spend billions redesigning roadways to support salmon spawning, in order to preserve Indigenous fishing rights. Says Kanji, who helped argue that case, \"The idea that tribes can use their treaty rights as a sword to protect the environment has gained greater currency,\" especially since the tribes united at Standing Rock in 2016 launched litigation against the Dakota Access pipeline. A district court judge recently ordered the pipeline to shut down, just one example of how growing respect for tribal sovereignty is also yielding victories in the lower courts. \"The Supreme Court definitely sets that tone,\" says Kanji. \"Its decisions are binding precedent.\" But he also acknowledges that the lower courts are diverse: Some appeals judges have construed tribal rights even more narrowly than Rehnquist, while others steadily expand them. Kronk Warner and Hedden-Nicely agree that a positive trend is emerging. As social movements like Standing Rock and Black Lives Matter raise the profile of oppressed groups and their struggles, law schools are finally teaching Indian law, and the new generation of lawyers and judges has been primed to hear it. \"It snowballs from there,\" says Hedden-Nicely. Those who understand the basis of tribal sovereignty are usually more inclined to defend it. Today's reckoning with American history might also play a role. Gorsuch opens his opinion by narrating a surprisingly emotive picture of tribes being marched halfway across the country, only for their new lands to be stripped-in previous eras such pathos may not have carried much weight. Kanji says his side strategically appealed to history. \"The states or others will spin these stories about how tribal rights were abrogated over time,\" he says. \"Unless you're offering a narrative that's more historically faithful, your side of the story will be lost.\" While the Supreme Court is insulated from outside advocacy, grassroots movements can beget changes that eventually affect major rulings. Justices \"reflect what the political system looked like when they were appointed, which is driven by what our culture is like,\" says Hedden-Nicely. \"But there's always a lag,\" since judicial turnover is slow; lawmakers and executives only gradually get chances to appoint and confirm new judges. Thus Kanji believes tribes must fight for their rights both in the courtroom and in the arena of public opinion. \"Many tribal cases fall at the intersection of the courts and the political system,\" he says. \"You can't litigate these cases in a vacuum, because there's always the possibility that a judicial gain could be undone by a legislative correction.\" The Tribal Supreme Court Project is already working on a Firth Circuit case concerning the Indian Child Welfare Act, which Hedden-Nicely calls \"the single most important issue for Indian Country today.\" Brackeen v. Bernhardt asks whether ICWA, through which Congress granted tribes priority in deciding foster care placements for Native children, violates an alleged Constitutional restriction on \"racial preferences.\" A judge ruled in 2018 that overturning the law would violate tribal sovereignty. Hedden-Nicely thinks the case isn't really about children but is just one of many \"unrelenting attacks on the idea that Indians have any special status under the law.\" He doesn't expect the Supreme Court, which has already twice upheld ICWA, to hear the Brackeen case. And if it did, given recent trends, it'd be unlikely to decide against tribes. \"At a time where Congress is not being particularly helpful on Indian policy, and the executive is being actively antagonistic, it's very comforting to have at least one branch of government acting in a way that's consistent with their trust responsibility to Indian tribes,\" says Hedden-Nicely. When the court sides with Congress and the president in ignoring tribal sovereignty, \"bad things start to happen.\" Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated that the Supreme Court returned \"half the land in Oklahoma\" to the Muscogee. In fact, the court's ruling concerned only a 3-million-acre swath, though the implications may ultimately affect about 40 percent of the state's land, as explained by Matthew L.M. Fletcher here .\n\n\"Indian tribes are the wards of the nation,\" wrote Justice Samuel Miller in that majority opinion , which Hedden-Nicely says \"acknowledged the sovereignty framework laid out by John Marshall, but at the same time essentially said, 'It doesn't apply anymore.'\"\n\nFrom that point on, Hedden-Nicely argues, the court had two conflicting sets of precedents it could follow.

      "text": "Native Americans Are Major Victims of Minneapolis Police Racism: DOJ\n\nA protester in Portland in June 2020 who held a sign that said, \"Natives 4 Black Lives Matter.\" Alex Milan Tracy/Sipa USA via AP Images\n\nAfter George Floyd's murder in 2020, Native Americans stood beside Black protesters in Minneapolis and called for changes to policing. Now, the Justice Department is highlighting how the city's cops have been racist against them, too.\n\nOn Friday, the department released a blistering report showing that for years, the Minneapolis police have discriminated against Native Americans as well as Black residents, creating the conditions that led to Floyd's death. The police are much more likely to stop and search people from both minority groups, the feds found, and to use force against them-especially in certain neighborhoods: In the Third Precinct, where many Native Americans live, the cops used force 69 percent more often during stops with Native Americans than in similar stops with white people from 2020 to 2022. They were 49 percent more likely to use force against Black people in the area.\n\nThe Justice Department's emphasis on brutality against Native residents in Minneapolis is significant, because police violence against Indigenous people is a national epidemic that has long been overlooked. Around the country, Native Americans are killed in police encounters at higher rates than any other racial group, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but these deaths often don't get much media attention.\n\nIn Minneapolis, Native groups have a long history of fighting police brutality. In 1968, they launched the American Indian Movement, a national civil rights group that, among other activities, patrolled the city to document police brutality. Today there are at least 35,000 Native Americans in the Minneapolis-St. Paul metro area, according to the Minneapolis American Indian Center.\n\nAccording to the Justice Department report, Native Americans make up a relatively small percent of Minneapolis' total population-about 1 percent. But when you control for these population differences, the data shows that police pull over Indigenous residents at wildly disproportionate rates. Citywide, the cops are 8 times more likely to stop Native American people than white people (and 6.5 times more likely to stop Black people), according to data from the last five years. After making a stop, the cops were nearly 20 times more likely to search Native Americans than they were to search white people (and nearly 13 times likelier to search Black people). \"The patterns and practices of conduct the Justice Department observed during our investigation are deeply disturbing,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said while announcing the report. \"They erode the community's trust in law enforcement. And they made what happened to George Floyd possible.\"\n\nSpeaking to the Minneapolis Star Tribune , Rachel Thunder, a member of the American Indian Movement, said the report confirmed stories that she's heard for years about racism against Native Americans in Minneapolis. Thunder herself was once arrested during a peaceful gathering. \"I know from experience,\" she said, that the Minneapolis Police Department \"is weaponized against our freedom of speech and right to protest.\"\n\nPresident Biden described the Justice Department findings as \"disturbing\" and said they demonstrated a need for Congress to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, a bill that would try to reduce racial profiling and excessive force by police nationally. The city of Minneapolis, in response to the report, agreed to negotiate a consent decree that will likely require hundreds of changes to work toward these goals. But, as my colleague Eamon Whalen writes , consent decrees in other places have had mixed results and can take a long time to implement. Vanita Gupta, the associate attorney general, put it another way in a statement about Minneapolis: \"Police reform does not happen overnight.\"\n\nCorrection, June 20: An earlier version of this story quoted from a 2020 Mother Jones article that included an inaccurate statistic about the Native American population in the Minneapolis metro area. The quote has been deleted, and a better statistic has been added.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "The US Government Has Always Undercounted Native Americans. But COVID-19 Could Make the 2020 Census a Disaster.\n\nAn enumerator taking the 1990 census on horseback in New Mexico US Census Bureau\n\nYou don't have to look far to see the devastating economic impact a community can face after the US Census screws up its population count. When the Treasury Department started doling out the funds from its mammoth CARES Act in March and April, it set aside $8 billion for Native American tribal governments, who were hurting from the closures of casinos and the general economic downturn that resulted from the indefinite suspension of life as we knew it. Of that $8 billion, $4.8 billion was to be divided among the nation's 574 federally recognized tribes based on their populations. (Never mind that the rest, as my colleague Delilah Friedler reports, could go to corporations .)\n\nIn April, tribes, upon the Treasury's request, submitted the populations of their enrolled tribal citizens. But the Treasury allocated funds not by tribal citizenship, but by data from the US Census Bureau, which estimates that it undercounted Native Americans living on reservations by 4.9 percent in 2010. The result, according to a report compiled by researchers from Harvard, the University of Arizona, and UCLA, was a severe misallocation of federal funds that left some tribes severely underfunded. The Delaware Tribe of Indians (Eastern), for example, has more than 11,000 enrolled tribal citizens, which could have netted them $24 million in CARES Act funding, according to the report; instead, because of the way the Treasury allocated money based on an Indian Housing Block Grant dataset derived from census numbers, the tribe received just $100,000, or a little more than $9 per person.\n\nNow, the same coronavirus that highlighted the necessity of an accurate count is threatening to condemn the roughly one million Native Americans living on reservations to 10 more years of political underrepresentation and economic insecurity.\n\nThe Census Bureau has been overlooking the continent's original inhabitants since it started its decennial population count in 1790. The very phrase in the Constitution that mandates \"counting the whole number of persons in each State\" explicitly excludes \"Indians not taxed\"-those who hadn't renounced tribal rule and integrated into white society. In 1860, the census began identifying Native Americans who lived within the general population-but not the many thousands residing on reservations. Only in 1900 were Native Americans living on tribal lands counted in the census and therefore represented in Congress, according to the Census Bureau . For myriad reasons that ultimately boil down to the US government's unwillingness to invest in the people whose resources it has squandered since the nation's inception, Native Americans have been regularly undercounted ever since-more than any other ethnic group.\n\nThe 2020 census website makes it easy to check localities' self-response rates; the national average, as of late June, is 61.8 percent. But select \"Tribal Area\" instead of \"State\" from the interactive map, and you'll see patches of red and orange representing areas with very low self-response rates. South Dakota's Rosebud Sioux tribe has a self-response rate of 9.3 percent as of June 29, down from a 2010 final self-response rate of 37.7 percent. The Crow Reservation of Montana is at 5.6 percent, down from 80 percent in 2010. And Navajo Nation, the most populous and vast of the tribal areas, and which by May had the highest per capita coronavirus infection rate in the nation, has a self-response rate of just 3 percent.\n\n\"If you want to have a worst case scenario on doing a census count in any state in Indian country, it's now,\" says OJ Semans, co-director of the Native American voting rights organization Four Directions and a member of the Rosebud Sioux tribe. \"Everything that can actually happen to give us an undercount is happening now.\"\n\nIf 2020 had been a normal year, census workers would have begun trekking to rural households-which often lack traditional street addresses or rely on PO boxes for their mail-to drop off census questionnaires between March 15 and April 17 in a program called Update Leave . Then, from May 13 through the end of July, the census would begin its Nonresponse Followup (known in census parlance as NRFU, pronounced \"nar-foo\"), the ambitious operation that sends door-knockers to each residence across the United States' 3.8 million square miles that has not returned a census form. The more people who self-respond, the less footwork the enumerators have to do.\n\nBut the coronavirus has thrown the Census Bureau's entire set of outreach operations into disarray . Update Leave began not on March 15 but on May 4, and NRFU is now scheduled to happen between August 11 and October 31. The Census Bureau is in a crunch: States rely on it to deliver them population counts and congressional apportionment data by March 31, 2021 so they can draw new district lines, and each delay in the count brings the Census Bureau closer to deadline. The Census Bureau and House Democrats have pushed for a four-month extension of this statutory deadline, but the idea has not gained traction in the Republican-controlled Senate.\n\nNow, the census's door-to-door visitations represent not civic engagement but the potential spread of a harmful pathogen to some of the most vulnerable communities. This is particularly troubling for often-rural and chronically undercounted tribal lands that are facing myriad obstacles to an accurate count, from the cancellation of in-person community outreach events to the difficulty of focusing on a population questionnaire when the whole world seems to be spinning in reverse.\n\n\"There still exists on many reservations a distrust for government people come around asking you for all kinds of personal information,\" says Kevin Allis , CEO of the National Congress of American Indians. An accurate count \"requires having folks that are employed by Census that had access to these communities, understood these communities, and, more importantly, would be recognized by these communities as reliable people to provide information.\"\n\nOne way to do this would be to reach out to Native communities in the languages they speak at home. This year, however, the Census Bureau cut language assistance for all Native languages except Navajo. Even though many (but not all) Native people speak English, Allis says, the failure to communicate with people in the language they speak most often further alienates them from a process they may be wary to partake in to begin with. \"It should be no surprise that if you don't communicate with these communities in a language that they're familiar and used to, they're not going to probably understand what you're trying to say,\" Allis says.\n\nAnother way to engage Native communities would be to hire more Native enumerators. But in 2020, the census shifted its job applications mostly online, making it difficult for people without internet access to find work with the Bureau. \"There was a fundamental problem with that approach,\" Allis says, \"and in making sure they have the right people in place to at least attempt to get an accurate count.\"\n\nIn fact, the census's digital-oriented approach to all of its 2020 outreach operations excluded the roughly 12 percent of Americans who don't have access to high-speed internet. This is the first year that the census is collecting forms online, and it has made a show of pivoting to digital and encouraging everyone with internet access to respond on their own. But what works for ultra-connected urban areas won't work in areas where wifi can't be found. \"Going very digital when 90 percent of Indian Country does not have access to broadband and can't get PDFs, it was a disaster waiting to happen,\" says Natalie Landreth, a senior staff attorney at the Native American Rights Fund.\n\nIt's not that people don't have digital devices, Semans says, but that they often can't afford the data plans that would allow them to access the census questionnaire online. \"Internet access is little to none,\" he says. \"Unless you're in a tribal building, which is closed down.\"\n\nFor the past 500 years, European diseases, especially smallpox, have ripped through Indigenous communities throughout North and South America, ravaging some tribes and obliterating others. The health disparities between Native peoples and their white counterparts persist to this day. American Indians and Alaska Natives have a lower life expectancy than all other races in the United States by 5.5 years, according to NCAI, and they are plagued by chronic illnesses like diabetes and liver disease at higher rates than other populations. All of these conditions place them at an increased risk of serious complications from the coronavirus.\n\nIn South Dakota, the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe set up checkpoints to ensure that no one infected with the coronavirus would enter their reservation. The state's Republican governor, Kristi Noem, threatened legal action against the tribe and even wrote a letter to President Trump to, in Semans' words, \"complain about her Indians\"-despite the tribe's legal status as a sovereign nation. None of this, of course, bodes well for the census. (The Cheyenne River tribe's self-response rate is 10.7 percent.)\n\nThe plan for enumeration in tribal communities still on lockdown is that there is no plan. Asked how it would endeavor to count the vast majority of people living on tribal lands who have not submitted self-responses, the Census Bureau directed me to its Operational Plan and NRFU plan , which have not been updated in light of the coronavirus. \" Census Bureau officials coordinated closely with the Navajo Nation and tribal governments,\" the agency wrote in response to written questions from Mother Jones . \"After their approval, we determined that it is safe to resume operations in the Window Rock, Ariz., Area Census Office on June 11, as well as other tribal lands.\" This hardly answers the question of when and whether the thousands of people living on tribal lands outside of Navajo Nation can expect a knock on their door.\n\nWith self-response rates in the single digits for many tribes across the country, Native Americans will have to wait to see if the Census Bureau figures out a way to get them counted. \"I understand none of us have ever been in this situation in our lifetime and I hope we're never in it again,\" Landreth says, \"but I think it calls for an extension of the timeframe, some extra money, and some extra work.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "The Buried Secrets of America's Indian Boarding Schools\n\nStairs lead to the basement of Drexel Hall at the Red Cloud Indian School on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. Some community members want the basement to be searched for unmarked graves. Mary Annette Pember/ICT\n\nIn the early 1990s, Justin Pourier was a maintenance man at Red Cloud Indian School, a Catholic school on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. One day, he says he stumbled upon small graves in the school's basement. For nearly 30 years, Pourier would be haunted by what he saw and told no one except his wife.\n\n\"Those are Native children down there...hopefully their spirit was able to travel on to whatever is beyond this world,\" Pourier says. In 2022, he urged school officials to search the basement for the graves.\n\nThe hunt for unmarked graves of Native children isn't happening just at Red Cloud, now called Maȟpíya Lúta. It's one of more than 400 Indian boarding schools across the country that were part of a program designed by the federal government to \"kill the Indian and save the man\"-those were the actual words of one of the architects of the plan to destroy Native culture. In a historic first this fall, President Joe Biden apologized to Native Americans on behalf of the United States for the country's past Indian boarding school policies.\n\nThis week on Reveal , in a two-part collaboration with ICT (formerly Indian Country Today ), we expose the painful legacy of boarding schools for Native children with ICT reporter Mary Annette Pember, a citizen of the Red Cliff Band of Ojibwe. She's been writing about these schools for more than two decades.

      "text": "How Football Shaped Indigenous Identity\n\nCarlisle Indian School players surround head coach Glenn \"Pop\" Warner in Carlisle, Penn., circa 1900s. AP Photo/Pro Football Hall of Fame\n\nOn Sunday, when the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers meet on the field for Super Bowl LIV, at least some headdress-adorned Chiefs fans in the stadium will be chanting and tomahawk-chopping their way through the team's first appearance in the big game since 1970. They will do this over the objections of Indigenous activists who have spoken out against the team's appropriation of Native imagery.\n\nOn the other side of the stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, fans will be wearing the scarlet and gold of the 49ers, a team name that likewise evokes American frontier history. The California Gold Rush ushered in a wave of violence and destruction for the original inhabitants of the land at the hands of the white settlers.\n\nFootball, a sport that rose to prominence as the western frontier was closing, is so suffused with the folklore of the country's violent expansion that even today, more than a century later, the dominant motif is still \"palefaces vs. redskins.\" Casual fans know that American football culture has always had a deep and complicated relationship with Indigenous Americans, as the regular protests over mascots and nicknames can attest. But that understates things. Football as we know it would not exist without the contributions of Native Americans. And while they've been relegated to the sidelines of the story the sport wants to tell about itself-a mythology built on the image of the white All-American hero-Indigenous Americans from the start have used football as a tool of identity formation in the face of white supremacy.\n\n\"They were the original student-athletes,\" said Dr. Beth Eby, a historian and postdoc fellow at the University of Texas. \"Through intercollegiate play, and through the publicity of the boarding schools, that really helps solidify football as this mainstream national pastime.\"\n\nThe most famous of the boarding schools was the Carlisle Indian School in Pennsylvania, a federal boarding school established in 1879 with the explicit goal of assimilating Native children into white society. The descendants of great leaders from various Indigenous nations were sent to Carlisle to be stripped of their culture, in accordance with founder William Henry Pratt's creed, \"Kill the Indian, save the man.\"\n\nFootball in those days was largely the domain of elites at places like Harvard and Yale, a way for American men to prove their masculinity now that there was no more territory left to conquer. But by 1912, one of the nation's best teams could be found at Carlisle. For Pratt, the sport proved to be the ultimate PR tool; The strong, healthy athletes on the gridiron were proof of his \"civilization\" project's success. They were also a curious spectacle . Fans and donors flocked to Carlisle to watch Glenn Scobey \"Pop\" Warner and his band of Carlisle Indians compete in the white man's game.\n\nThe Carlisle team revolutionized the game with their style of play. Every forward pass Pat Mahomes and Jimmy Garoppolo throw on Sunday will owe at least something to the innovations of Pop Warner's teams. By playing to their strengths, they helped transform the game from one of brute force and mass momentum into a contest won by speed and cunning. For the students themselves, football-and the success they found in it-meant something else entirely.\n\n\"It was kind of a way of survival for a lot of students,\" said John Bloom, a professor of history at Shippenburg University. His book To Show What an Indian Can Do: Sports at Native American Boarding Schools chronicles the history of sports at Carlisle. Football \"was something that students could adapt to their own purposes.\"\n\nIn the eyes of the school's administrators, the Carlisle boys were \"Indians\" in much the same way Kansas City players are \"Chiefs\" now-not an ethnic identity so much as a mascot, a marketing ploy, an exoticized \"other\" to pit against the palefaces. As historian Michael Oriard points out, the absence of a conspicuous other in the very early days of football had covered up the sense of racial destiny at the heart of the sport. The subtext became text with the Carlisle teams. \"Wily, wiry redskins from the fortress of Carlisle went on the war path this afternoon for the sons of Eli,\" read one account of an 1897 game between Carlisle and Yale. \"Puritan and savage came together in a new and modernized phase of the Indian question...So paleface warred with redskin from after the dinner hour until the going down of the sun.\"\n\nBut the explicit racialization of the sport had the ironic effect of encouraging racial consciousness among Indigenous athletes. The players began to develop a serious racial identity in the shadows of the one being thrust on them. Race, history, and pride were at stake when they played all-white opponents-the Army teams, for instance, whose rosters were full of the sons of the officers who had destroyed the Carlisle Indians' ancestral lands.\n\n\"Boarding schools brought all of these different people together, and they formed this shared identity that ultimately became de-colonial,\" said Eby. \"Sport was really important in doing that because it brought different communities together, but it also afforded Native peoples to feel pride in their own individual nation.\"\n\nPerhaps the most important symbol of this pride was Jim Thorpe, a Carlisle student and member of the Sac and Fox Nation who was once called the \" greatest athlete in the world .\" After being named All-American at Carlisle twice, Thorpe would go on to become an Olympic gold medalist, excel in basketball and baseball, and become the first president of the American Professional Football League, later known as the NFL.\n\nThorpe was widely recognized for his exceptional athletic ability in his day, but the accolades he received were marred by the racism that pervaded sports. The mainstream sports press alternately characterized him as the hot-blooded redskin or noble savage as it suited their narratives. Thorpe wasn't allowed to be fully American (literally-Natives were considered wards of the government until 1924 when they were granted full citizenship) and never celebrated in his Indigenous identity beyond dehumanizing tropes.\n\nAmong Indigenous Americans, however, Thorpe remained an important figure well beyond his death in 1953. Nearly everyone I interviewed for this story mentioned him. Since Thorpe's day there have been dozens of professional football players claiming Indigenous ancestry, including the Chiefs' James Winchester , who is from Choctaw Nation.\n\nWithin Indigenous communities, the sport continues to be an important tool to celebrate identity and community. Bennae Calac is the founder of the youth nonprofit 7G Foundation , which hosts an annual \"Indigenous Bowl,\" inviting football teams from reservations and Native communities across the country to compete in southern California. Calac says she created the organization in response to the lack of opportunity afforded Native youth by larger college and professional football organizations.\n\n\"The Indigenous Bowl was created to help our communities be seen as great athletes, but also have people understand that the strength behind us is our culture and who we are. It is our identity,\" said Calac. \"We want to show that we're just as good as everybody else. But it's not to show everybody, it's for ourselves.\"\n\nDon Wexel, the director of Montana Indian Athletic Hall of Fame, says it's important for Indigenous youth not only to know the legacy of athletes who came before but to participate in sports themselves. Football could still be for the young Indigenous athletes of today what it was for the Carlisle boys of the previous century. \"It allows our youth to just be who they are,\" Wexel said. \"We don't have to fit into their vision of how we need to be.\"\n\nThe only legacy the NFL would have for Native peoples in football, meanwhile, is offensive and ahistorical. Take the Chiefs' tomahawk chop - fans only began slicing their arms through and wailing the \"war chant\" in the 1990s, encouraged by a head coach who'd seen a similar performance from the Northwest Missouri State band, which was itself derived from the chop done at Florida State University. Since its inception, the chop has been a hazy paleface notion of what \"Indians\" do, never an actual historical homage.\n\nVincent Schilling, associate editor of Indian Country Today and a member of the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe, has been one of the most outspoken critics of the Chiefs. He explained in an interview why he finds the appropriation so hurtful.\n\n\"When they were all dressing up like Indians, and everyone wants to be an Indian, at residential schools Native kids were hit, abused, ridiculed for speaking their language or being an Indian in any way, including my grandmother. So people say they honor me? I don't look at dressing up like a fake Indian as an honor.\" Schilling says he wants football fans to recognize this history, and at least be open to change.\n\n\"All I really do ask is for you to listen. It is possible to have civil conversations and, and have conversations that maybe you can kind of share some sentiments of understanding.\"\n\nFootball history cannot be extricated from US history, but neither can it be teased apart from Indigenous history. As individuals and as a collective, Native peoples have not been mere symbols, but actors shaping the history of the game, and using the game within their own histories.  Their relationship to football does not begin and end at the question of who gets to wear a headdress at a game, but let it not be mistaken that Indigenous people are in fact the ultimate arbiters of this question. Not Daniel Snyder or Clark Hunt .  Indigenous Americans were the original inhabitants of this land and some of the original innovators in football. The sport belongs to them as much as it belongs to anyone.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "How Giving Native Americans Their Land Back Helps Protect Nature\n\nThe National Bison Range in Montana. Luke Franzen/Getty Images\n\nThis story was originally published by Yale E360 and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.\n\nIn 1908 the U.S. government seized some 18,000 acres of land from the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes to create the National Bison Range in the heart of their reservation in the mountain-ringed Mission Valley of western Montana.\n\nWhile the goal of protecting the remnants of America's once-plentiful bison was worthy, for the last century the federal facility has been a symbol to the tribes here of the injustices forced upon them by the government, and they have long fought to get the bison range returned.\n\nLast December their patience paid off: President Donald Trump signed legislation that began the process of returning the range to the Salish and Kootenai.\n\nNow the tribes are managing the range's bison and are also helping, through co-management, to manage bison that leave Yellowstone National Park to graze on U.S. Forest Service land. Their Native American management approach is steeped in the close, almost familial, relationship with the animal that once provided food, clothes, shelter-virtually everything their people needed.\n\n\"We treat the buffalo with less stress, and handle them with more respect,\" said Tom McDonald, Fish and Wildlife Division Manager for the tribes and a tribal member. The tribes, he noted, recognize the importance of bison family groups and have allowed them to stay together. \"That was a paradigm shift from what we call the ranching rodeo type mentality here, where they were storming the buffalo and stampeding animals. It was really kind of a violent, stressful affair.\"\n\nThere is a burgeoning movement these days to repatriate some culturally and ecologically important lands back to their former owners, the Indigenous people and local communities who once lived there, and to otherwise accommodate their perspective and participation in the management of the land and its wildlife and plants.\n\nThroughout the United States, land has been or is being transferred to tribes or is being co-managed with their help. In California, a land trust recently transferred 1,199 acres of redwood forest and prairie to the Esselen tribe, and in Maine, the Five Tribes of the Wabanaki Confederacy recently reacquired a 150-acre island with the help of land trusts. Other recent land transfers to tribes with the goal of conservation have taken place in Oregon, New York and other states.\n\nThe use of Indigenous management styles that evolved over many centuries of cultures immersed in nature-formally called Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK)-is increasingly seen by conservationists as synergistic with the global campaign to protect biodiversity and to manage nature in a way that hedges against climate change.\n\nThe Nature Conservancy, for example, one of the world's largest conservation organizations, has institutionalized the transfer of ecologically important land with its Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities Program in both the U.S. and globally.\n\n\"If you look at it from a land justice perspective, we need to support a strengthening and healing of that relationship,\" said Erin Myers Madeira, director of Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities program for the Nature Conservancy. \"If you look at it practically, Indigenous people are the original stewards of all the lands and waters in North America, and there's an extensive knowledge and management practices that date back millennia.\"\n\nOne of the largest completed land transfers began eight years ago in Australia when the federal and state governments bought 19 separate farm properties and the associated water rights for $180 million in the Lower Murrumbidgee Valley in New South Wales. The goal was to restore the vast and fertile wetlands-rich with birds, fish and other species-that had been damaged by wholesale water diversion for agriculture.\n\nInterested parties were invited to submit proposals for the management of what was then called the Nimmie-Caira wetlands. A consortium that included the Nature Conservancy and the tribal council of the Nari Nari, the Indigenous people who have inhabited the region for 50,000 years, won the right to manage the property.\n\nThe old irrigation infrastructure was removed and altered to return to a more natural and traditional water regime. In 2018, the first water using the wilder approach began flowing, and species such as golden perch and southern bell frogs, along with spoonbills, egrets, black swans and other birds, grew more abundant. The Nari Nari found and protected ancestral burial grounds, ancient clay ovens and other cultural sites, and hunted out thousands of invasive species , including feral pigs, deer, foxes and cats.\n\nIn 2019 the Nature Conservancy transferred the more than 200,000 acres of the Nimmi Carrie property to the sole ownership of the Nari Nari, who now manage it. The Nari Nari have renamed it Gayini, which means 'water' in their language.\n\n\"This is a significant event for the Nari Nari people, who have been using traditional knowledge to sustain our country for thousands of years,\" said Nari Nari Tribal Chairman Ian Woods. \"We can continue to protect the environment, preserve the Aboriginal heritage of the land and enable the intergenerational transfer of knowledge of caring for country.\"\n\nIt's hard for outsiders to fathom how differently many Indigenous cultures perceive the landscape and wild creatures, and their relationship to it, but it is clear their lives have been deeply intertwined with the natural world in a very different way than non-Indigenous cultures.\n\nIn a recent report, two U.S. Forest Service researchers, David Flores and Gregory Russell, offered an explanation of the difference between European and Indigenous concepts of nature. Indigenous holistic knowledge \"regards animals and features of the landscape as possessing characteristics that Western minds typically ascribe only to humans, e.g. having points of view, exhibiting agency, and engaging in reciprocal communication.\"\n\nThat fits with a description of the Salish Kootenai perspective on bison. \"Buffalo power, being considered supernatural, was appealed to for the healing of the sick, for protection from enemies, and for prophecies regarding the welfare of the individual petitioner and the destiny of the tribal group...\" wrote Henry Burland in 1941, as part of the Montana Writer's Project. \"Their myths reveal a close intimacy between Indian and buffalo.\"\n\nBecause of this relationship and kinship with other species, as well as the land itself, new management policies and major changes among the Salish and Kootenai require that resource managers consult with tribal elders to maintain a close cultural connection with the bison.\n\nThat includes the traditional use of fire to manage the buffalo and the landscape. \"The green-up after a burn is a huge attraction to buffalo,\" said McDonald. \"They can smell that succulent one inch of green that comes up in the black ground after a fire. Burning maintained hunting grounds and strong game populations like a farmer or rancher would do.\"\n\nThe traditional use of fire may be the most talked-about topic involving traditional ecological knowledge these days, because of the catastrophic fires that have swept the American West. In addition to using \"fire as medicine\" to manage wildlife habitat and forests to increase ecological resilience or to grow certain useful species for such things as basket making or food, traditional planned burning has important applications to reduce the intensity of conflagrations. A recent study found that the Indigenous fire regime in the forest around the Jemez Pueblo in New Mexico-primarily perennial small fires and wood gathering in settled areas-\"made the landscape resistant to extreme fire behavior.\"\n\nThe model has implications for managing fires in the wildlands-urban interface across the Western United States, where homes and forests are intermingled.\n\nThe trend of increasing aboriginal management is not just about providing title to new land. The Obama Administration envisioned that Bear's Ears National Monument in Utah, filled with sacred and other Native cultural sites, would be co-managed by the Department of Interior and a five-tribe coalition. And last fall, a report was published by Martin Nie and Monte Mills, professors of natural resource policy and Indian law respectively at the University of Montana-though acting as private individuals-on the steps needed to overcome barriers and increase co-management of America's public lands with tribes, especially changes in federal law that would require agencies to work with tribes on a co-management basis.\n\nNow, with Native American Deb Haaland at the helm of the Interior Department, the movement toward co-management of public lands with the tribes, if not outright transfer, is expected to gain steam. President Biden has pledged to listen to and work with Native tribes in the West as he moves to protect more public land and, especially, as he moves to fulfill his promise to protect 30 percent of the U.S. by 2030, the 30×30 plan .\n\nOther countries have adopted similar projects. In Canada for example, the federal government partnered with the Qikiqtani Inuit Association to co-manage the Tallurutiup Imanga National Marine Conservation Area & Tuvaijuittuq Marine Protected Area in the Nunavut Territory, which encompasses much of Canada's northern region. The native name \"Tuvaijuittuq\" means \"the last ice area,\" and it is the place where the ice that now remains in the Arctic is the thickest and is likely to last the longest in the face of climate change. It could well become the last refuge for polar bears, seals, narwhal, walrus and beluga, as well as the algae beneath the ice that is the bottom of the Arctic food chain. It could be the last refuge, too, for subsistence hunters as the climate warms.\n\nLocal land trusts are also moving toward the return of land. In addition to the Nature Conservancy, which has perhaps a dozen projects in the U.S., some local efforts are seeking this kind of redress. First Light is an effort by dozens of land trusts and five tribes of the Wabanaki Confederacy tribes, to have access to ancestral lands throughout Maine for hunting, gathering and ceremonial purposes. It includes a 150-acre island that the Passamaquoddy called Pine Island, which was taken from them by European settlers. And last month, the New York-based Open Space Institute transferred 156 acres along the Hudson River to the Mohican Nation Stockbridge-Munsee Band, which will manage it as a nature preserve.\n\nThe Esselen Tribe of California, which had inhabited the Big Sur region for thousands of years, was stripped of its culture and lands by the Spanish, who built missions in the region. The Western Rivers Conservancy, with funding from the California Natural Resources Agency, arranged the purchase of a 1,199-acre ranch with redwood forest and a crystalline stream, the Little Sur, where steelhead spawn, to protect it and planned to donate it to the U.S. Forest Service. Locals objected, and so last year they instead transferred the property, valued at $4.5 million, to the Esselen - 250 years after it was taken. The tribe says it will protect natural values, including spawning steelhead, the California spotted owl, the endangered Calfiornia condor and habitat that connects the ocean to the Santa Lucia Mountains, as well as use the land for traditional ceremonies and plant gathering.\n\nIn many cases, tribes are buying land that is important to them. In Northern California, the Yurok Tribe, the largest tribe in California, owns 44 miles of land along the Klamath River. They have been piecing back their aboriginal lands, with the help of land conservation groups such as the Trust for Public Land and Western Rivers Conservancy, to protect the habitat of their primary food source, salmon, and to assure access to ceremonial grounds and other cultural landscapes. The Yurok have purchased more than 80,000 acres to add to their holdings, including 50,000 acres that had been been owned by a timber company and surround four salmon spawning streams that the tribe now plans to restore.\n\nMuch of the campaign to return Indian land or at least allow co-management is part of the racial justice movement that is sweeping the globe. In the American Indian community, it's called #Landback -and some in that movement see a more radical form of reconciliation.\n\nIn a recent article in the Atlantic, David Treuer, a Native American, citing the litany of forced removal and broken treaties that enabled the creation of U.S. national parks, advocated for giving a consortium of Native American tribes the ownership and management responsibility-with binding covenants to protect natural values-for all 85 million acres of the national park system, as reparations in kind for land that was stolen from them.\n\n\"The total acreage would not quite make up for the General Allotment Act, which robbed us of 90 million acres, but it would ensure that we have unfettered access to our tribal homelands,\" he wrote. \"And it would restore dignity that was rightfully ours. To be entrusted with the stewardship of America's most precious landscape would be a deeply meaningful form of restitution.\"\n\nStill, there are some concerns about possible downsides to tribal management. Will tribes allow hunting in places where it hasn't been allowed because of tradition? Or will a change in tribal administrations alter policies toward ecologically important lands that no longer favor protection?\n\nThe Confederated Salish and Kootenai tribal management of natural resources has been highly praised. They created the nation's first tribal wilderness area, the Mission Mountain Wilderness Area, and annually close off 10,000 acres of it to humans to allow grizzly bears-a spirit animal-to feed on a summer bonanza of lady bugs and army cutworm moths high in the mountains.\n\nBut there are numerous examples of natural resource exploitation by tribes as well, and some critics say problems could arise from Indigenous management.\n\nAfter a decades-long fight to get oil and gas leases voided in the Badger-Two Medicine area along Montana's wild Rocky Mountain Front, a bill was introduced in Congress to allow the Blackfeet to co-manage the Badger-Two Medicine, part of the Helena-Lewis and Clark National Forest , as a 'cultural heritage area.'\n\nGeorge Wuerthner, the Oregon director of the Western Watersheds Project and a longtime public lands watchdog, observed in a recent blog post that the Blackfeet Reservation, near the Badger-Two Medicine, is far from an example of good conservation stewardship, with widespread leasing for oil and gas fracking, livestock overgrazing along many riparian areas, and poaching, including of grizzly bears.\n\n\"One hopes that if the tribe is given co-management of the area, they will treat these public lands better than they treat their reservation lands,\" Wuerthner wrote. \"However, the way to assure that this will happen is by designating the area a wilderness area. A 'cultural heritage' area is an untested designation and may not guarantee full protection of the landscape.\"\n\nThose who are working to get some conservation landscapes into the hands of Indigenous people say a growing number of studies have shown the efficacy of native management. For example, a study published last year by Richard Shuster and Ryan R. Germain of the University of British Columbia found that Indigenous-managed lands in Australia, Brazil and Canada were richer in vertebrate species than existing protected areas.\n\nIn some cases, proponents admit, there could be negative impacts for conservation goals if ecologically important landscapes are managed by Indigenous people. But, \"when you look holistically, the benefits and the approaches Indigenous people have taken have been far and away better than many of the Western approaches,\" said Brian O'Donnell, director of the Wyss Foundation's Campaign for Nature. \"Does that mean that universally every place will be conserved for biodiversity? No. But if we embrace and learn from an Indigenous world view on land and use that as a paradigm in which to set a lot of our future conservation approaches, I think we will be a whole lot better off than if we don't.\"\n\nCorrection, June 4, 2021 : An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified the status of Badger-Two Medicine in Montana. It is not a federally protected Wilderness Area but is part of the Helena-Lewis and Clark National Forest.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Catholic Bishops Finally Apologize for Church's Role in Harming Kids at Indigenous Boarding Schools\n\nStudents at Sherman Institute in Riverside, California, take part in a Christmas Nativity play. From \"Shadows of Sherman Institute,\" by Cliff Trafzer, Jeffrey Smith, Lorene Sisquoc. Photo courtesy of Sherman Indian Museum\n\nThe US Conference of Catholic Bishops, which creates policies for the church in the United States, formally apologized on Friday for the church's role in traumatizing Native American children at boarding schools until the mid-1900s. It's \"the most direct expression of regret to date\" by church officials for forcibly assimilating Indigenous kids into white culture, according to the Washington Post , whose investigative reporters recently documented the widespread sexual abuse by priests and nuns at these schools.\n\n\"The family systems of many Indigenous people never fully recovered from these tragedies, which often led to broken homes harmed by addiction, domestic abuse, abandonment and neglect,\" the bishops said in a 56-page document , which came after decades of attempts by Native Americans to demand accountability from the US government and the Catholic Church. There were more than 500 schools in the United States, and 84 of them were operated by the church or its religious affiliates, according to the bishops' document.\n\nPhotographer Daniella Zalcman, who spoke with Mother Jones about images she took of boarding school survivors in Canada, said the US government \"invented\" the playbook for harming children at these facilities in the late 1800s:\n\nA government employee, called an Indian agent, would show up on reserves and in Native communities, and effectively kidnap all of the kids under the age of 15-some were as young as two or three. Once they got to school, they were forced to wear Western clothing, their hair was often cut off, and they were punished if they spoke their own languages or practiced their own cultural traditions. There was rampant physical and sexual assault. In extreme cases, there was sterilization and medical testing.\n\nTens of thousands of Native kids were sent to these schools in the United States. The US Department of Interior estimates that at least 500 of them died there.\n\nCliff Trafzer, a professor of American Indian History at the University of California-Riverside, told my former Mother Jones colleague Maha Ahmed that the schools were \"an attempt to destroy that which was Indian and re-create people in the image of White America.\" He previously worked at one of these schools and co-authored a photo book about it, which shows boys getting short haircuts, the mandatory style, and girls posing with Santa during a Christmas party; kids generally stayed on campus to celebrate Christmas with their boarding school \"family.\"\n\n\"We want our culture back. We want our language back. We want our ceremonies back. We want our lives back.\"\n\nThe bishops' apology on Friday did not refer specifically to sexual abuse, even though the Post found at least 122 priests, sisters and brothers at 22 Catholic-run boarding schools who were later accused of sexually abusing Native American children under their care. \"The Church recognizes that it has played a part in traumas experienced by Native children,\" the bishops wrote.\n\nThey added later, \"These multigenerational traumas continue to have an impact today, one that is perpetuated by racism and neglect of all kinds. Through our listening sessions, we heard that many Indigenous people feel unaccepted by and unwelcomed in society and even the Church.\"\n\nSome Native Americans told the Post that they appreciated the gesture but wanted more from the church: \"It would be more meaningful to people if the pope issued an apology himself,\" said Warren Morin, whose grandfather and other relatives attended the Catholic-run St. Paul Mission and Boarding School in Montana. In 2022, Pope Francis apologized for the church's role in \"forced assimilation\" in Canada, but he has not spoken out about it in the United States.\n\nPhotographer Zalcman shared portraits of survivors with Mother Jones and spoke with them about their memories. Here's Pat Pumpkin Seed, who attended Holy Rosary Mission from 1949 to 1960.\n\n\"I got whipped constantly in school. Whipped for messing around in church, whipped for not praying, whipped for speaking Lakota with my brother. I always thought that was so stupid. All I want-all the Lakota have ever wanted-is to be allowed to be ourselves. We want our culture back. We want our language back. We want our ceremonies back. We want our lives back.\"\n\nHere's Wanda Garnier, who attended the same school from 1958 1963:\n\n\"For years afterwards I'd wake up in a cold sweat, always from the same nightmare. The nuns were coming to take me back. Mother Edeltrude was standing over me and telling me we had to stay there the rest of our lives...Those women treated us like we were savages who had to be civilized. I thought we were pretty civilized, but I guess not in their books.\"\n\nAnd Lisa Schrader, who attended St. Joe's Indian School from 1974 to 1979 and Red Cloud Indian School from 1979 to 1982, spoke on the importance of acknowledging wrongdoing:\n\n\"You know, healing requires acknowledgement. And when we were taken away from our homes and we lost our language and we lost our culture and we lost our identity, no one ever told us, 'Welcome home. I'm glad you made it back.' People need that, and they haven't gotten that.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Why Are Right-Wing Groups Targeting a Law Aimed at Protecting Native Families?\n\nMother Jones illustration; Getty\n\nIn 2016, a Navajo and Cherokee 10-month-old named Zachary arrived in the home of a white, evangelical couple named Jennifer and Chad Brackeen. The Brackeens lived on an acre lot outside of Fort Worth, Texas, with a pool and a zip line. The couple had come to believe that fostering children was one way, they told the New York Times in 2019, to \"rectify our blessings.\"\n\nThe Brackeens were told from the outset that they would not be able to adopt the baby, whose mother had a history of drug use. The Indian Child Welfare Act, the 1978 legislation passed in response to the long history of family separation and forced assimilation of Native communities, prioritizes placing Native children who have been removed from their parents with relatives and members of the same tribe. But the Brackeens became attached to Zachary and, by the spring of 2017, had decided they wanted to adopt him. When a judge ordered that Zachary be placed with a Navajo couple who could adopt him, the Brackeens pushed back, obtaining an emergency stay. Eventually, the tribe backed out. The Brackeens finalized their adoption.\n\nThe custody battle for Zachary is one of three lawsuits that now form the basis of the Supreme Court case known as Brackeen v. Haaland . In all three lawsuits, non-Native foster parents wanted to adopt Native children; two of the three were ultimately successful in doing so. But the foster parents-along with the attorneys general for three states, with the backing of deep-pocketed right-wing groups like the Goldwater Institute and the Bradley Foundation-are suing the federal government and five tribes on the grounds that ICWA represents race-based discrimination and an overly intrusive federal government.\n\n\"One of the things that tribes need to continue to exist is their children,\" says Shannon Smith, executive director of the Indian Child Welfare Act Law Center, which provides legal services for Native families. \"Things just don't exist if you don't have kids.\"\n\nSome legal scholars argue that the case, which will be heard before the court on Wednesday, threatens to not only strike down ICWA, but also to question the fundamental rights of tribes that go well beyond child welfare-including rights around water, land, gaming, policing, and Native sovereignty itself.\n\nFor 150 years, the federal government funded more than 400 boarding schools, often run by churches, that stripped Native children of their language, religion, and culture. As the boarding school movement died down in the mid-1900s, government-sponsored programs, including the Indian Adoption Project , emerged to place Native children with non-Native adoptive families. A 1966 Bureau of Indian Affairs press release read, \"One little, two little, three little Indians-and 206 more-are brightening the homes and lives of 172 American families, mostly non-Indians, who have taken the Indian waifs as their own.\"\n\nBy the time ICWA passed in 1978, between 25 and 35 percent of all Native children had been taken from their families and put in foster homes, adoptive homes, or institutions, according to surveys by the Association on American Indian Affairs.\n\nThe recency and lingering trauma of this history can't be overstated. One of the three lawsuits wrapped into the Supreme Court case involves Christian foster parents in Minnesota, Danielle and Jason Clifford, who sought custody of a girl whom they raised for 18 months who goes by P.S. in court documents. After a years-long battle, P.S.'s grandmother, Robyn Bradshaw, a member of the White Earth band, won custody of her granddaughter. A striking amicus brief Bradshaw filed in the case reads:\n\nAs a child, Ms. Bradshaw was forced from her own home into a residential boarding school-from which she ran away. Thus when she was separated from P.S., she resolved to persist until her granddaughter was returned to her care. When the County erroneously refused to place P.S. with Ms. Bradshaw, she pressed on, attending every hearing in P.S.'s case. Ms. Bradshaw persisted in investigating placements with family and kin; she persisted by finding a non-profit to provide legal support to her efforts; she persisted in overcoming disqualifiers to her foster care license; she persisted through home studies, administrative corrections, hurtful media coverage, hearings, and appeals.\n\nShe persisted until her granddaughter came home.\n\nFederal policy, as well as decades of research on best practices, instructs child protective services to keep families intact when possible. When children are removed because of suspected abuse or neglect, states must make \"reasonable efforts\" to reunite children with their parents. But time and time again , CPS agencies fail to live up to these principles: Examples abound of children who didn't need to be removed to begin with and of relatives volunteering as foster placements who were overlooked. Such treatment is particularly well-documented in cases of Black and Indigenous families, who are far more likely to enter foster care than white children.\n\nICWA adds guardrails at every step of a child welfare case. The law raises the standards needed to remove a child; except in emergency circumstances, children are placed in foster care only if there is \"clear and convincing evidence,\" including testimony of culturally qualified expert witness, that the child will likely be harmed if they stay with their parent or guardian. If children are removed from the home, the state must prioritize placing them with relatives or members of the tribe.\n\nCritically, ICWA requires the state to take \"active efforts\" to reunite Native children with their families. In non-ICWA cases, it's not uncommon for parents to receive a list of services, like therapy or parenting classes, they must pursue to be reunified with their children. In ICWA cases, however, caseworkers specifically trained in working with tribes may make phone calls to help parents get housing, financial support, or other needed services. David Simmons, director of government affairs and advocacy at the National Indian Child Welfare Association, said \"active efforts\" could mean saying to a parent, \"I think we should work with helping you towards your parenting capacity. We have a class on Wednesdays at 7:00 on the other side of town. Do you have transportation? Do you have child care needs? Are there any considerations around your work schedule? We want to make sure this is the right class for you, so we've also checked in to make sure that they've worked with other Native families so far and done so successfully.\"\n\nICWA does not mean that Native kids are only placed with families or tribes. In fact, Simmons says, about the same number of Native children are adopted by non-Native families as Native families.\n\nIn the four decades since the law's passage, ICWA has become a model for federal and state child welfare policy reform-particularly its focus on placing children with relatives or friends of the family when possible.\n\n\"ICWA more than exemplifies these best practices; it helped shape them\" reads an amicus brief in support of the defendants by Casey Family Programs. \"ICWA's strong commitment to preserving Indian children's family and community ties is essential to protecting their best interests. All children would benefit from such a commitment.\"\n\nThe Brackeens' case did not organically evolve from a local custody fight to a Supreme Court case. Rather, it is the result of yearslong effort of a small group of right-wing organizations to overturn ICWA.\n\nAmong them are the Goldwater Institute, a conservative think tank in Arizona that has argued against ICWA in more than a dozen cases since 2015, claiming that the law denies Native children of equal protection against abuse and neglect because of their race. Clint Bolick, who led Goldwater's litigation strategy before becoming a justice for the Arizona Supreme Court, has made a name for himself arguing discrimination in cases ranging from voting rights to school integration to affirmative action. The Times once referred to Bolick as the \"political right's point man on race.\"\n\nThen there's Gibson Dunn, the law firm which has been representing the Brackeens pro bono. The firm has represented plaintiffs in several cases that take issue with laws specific to Native communities; Matthew McGill, the lawyer representing the Brackeens, also serves as counsel for a casino company in a federal case arguing that the Washington law limiting sports wagering to tribal entities is discriminatory. Gibson Dunn is known for representing Chevron in the decade-long lawsuit brought by indigenous communities in Ecuador, as well as the corporation behind the Dakota Access Pipeline .\n\nSeveral of the groups supporting the plaintiffs-including the Goldwater Institute, the Cato Institute, and Texas Public Policy Foundation, and the Project on Fair Representation-have received substantial funding from the fossil fuel billionaire Koch brothers and their network. Critics note that the fossil fuel industry has a track record of supporting cases that threaten tribal sovereignty. \"The collective rights of a nation and its sovereignty must be weakened or destroyed to gain access to its lands and resources,\" noted Native journalist and historian Nick Estes in the Guardian .\n\nAnother common source of funding is the Bradley Foundation, a family foundation in Wisconsin that funds coordinated, state-based bills and movements for conservative causes-like voter ID laws or, more recently, the organizations stoking fear about election fraud. This Land , a podcast about Native issues, first reported on the Bradley funding in its second season, which details the right-wing attack on ICWA. The foundation funds several organizations that wrote amicus briefs for the plaintiffs, including providing the seed funding that guides Goldwater's litigation strategy. Paul Clement, a lawyer who argued before the Supreme Court in 2014 in another case that attempted to topple ICWA, sits on the foundation's board.\n\n\"There was a whole machine ready to take the case to the court once they found the Brackeens and the other plaintiffs,\" This Land host Rebecca Nagle told Mother Jones.\n\nThe Brackeens were strategic plaintiffs; their case fell under the jurisdiction of Texas federal Judge Reed O'Connor, who has a long history of siding with Republican attorneys general filing ideological lawsuits in cases that make their way to the Supreme Court. O'Connor has also struck down the Affordable Care Act, ruled against DACA, and struck down protections for transgender youth. In October 2018, O'Connor heard the Brackeens' case and invalidated key provisions of ICWA, holding that the law violates equal protection rights.\n\nThe plaintiffs argue that ICWA discriminates against non-Native parents based on race. \"Our position is that, no less than non-Indian children, Indian children are entitled to a placement based on their best interests, rather than on stereotypes about what is good for Indian children as a category,\" said Matthew McGill, an attorney for the Brackeens. He added that the worries about the ramifications of the case aren't founded: \"The Supreme Court has said tribal sovereign interests include regulating Indian lands, tribal self-government, and tribes' internal affairs. ICWA does not apply on Indian lands, and the state court proceedings ICWA alters obviously are not internal affairs of tribes.  So, whatever happens with ICWA, it will not affect tribal sovereign interests.\"\n\nThe defendants counter that Native sovereignty is not based on race, but political status. This classification was made explicit in the 1974 case Morton v. Mancari , when the Supreme Court ruled that the Bureau of Indian Affairs could give hiring preferences to Native Americans. The court ruled, \"The preference, as applied, is granted to Indians not as a discrete racial group, but rather, as members of quasi-sovereign tribal entities whose lives and activities are governed by the BIA in a unique fashion.\"\n\nIf the Supreme Court rules against ICWA on the grounds that Native identity is a racial category, many worry that the same argument could be used to toss out virtually every component of Native sovereignty.\n\nA ruling against ICWA could mean \"the unraveling of the legal structure that defends the rights of indigenous nations in this country,\" says Nagle, who is Cherokee. \"I legally can carry an eagle feather, whereas you can't. I can go be seen at an [Indian Health Services] clinic. We have our own courts and elections and police force. What other 'racial group' manages their own land? Has different tax codes on their land? All of that is what could fall if ICWA gets toppled and is the first domino.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

At one event, Sheehy said he had roped cattle with Crow members, calling it \"a great way to bond with all the Indians while they're drunk at 8 a.m. and you're roping together.\" At another event, while talking about participating in a parade at the Crow Fair, he said, \"They'll let you know whether they like you or not - there's Coors Light cans flying by your head.\"\n\nHis comments were first reported last week by Char-Koosta News , a local outlet that covers the Flathead Indian Reservation. The New York Times also published audio of Sheehy's comments on Tuesday. According to recordings published by Char-Koosta News, Sheehy repeated his \"Coors Light cans\" line at two other events, though it's unclear when those took place.\n\nSheehy's remarks were met with anger by the Rocky Mountain Tribal Leaders Council, which represents a number of tribes and First Nations in North America. Council Chair Bryce Kirk said in a letter to Sheehy on Tuesday that the Republican \"insult[ed] us with a stereotype that only seeks to severely diminish and dishonor our people,\" according to The Associated Press . \"The Crow people are not your punchline. Native Americans are not your punchline,\" Kirk added.\n\nNeither MSNBC nor NBC News has verified the recordings. Sheehy's campaign did not immediately respond to MSNBC's request for comment on Wednesday, but his spokesperson, Jack O'Brien, did not dispute the veracity of the recordings to The Associated Press.\n\nO'Brien did not say if Sheehy will respond to the council's letter or apologize for his comments, but he told the AP, \"What folks are insinuating about him, that's just not who he is.\"\n\nThe reporting comes amid a tight race that has the potential to determine which party controls the Senate next year. Native Americans are an important voting bloc in Montana, and their support will be crucial in November. Although Donald Trump handily won Montana in 2020, counties with majority Native Americans largely backed Democratic candidates . Sen. Jon Tester, a Democrat seeking his fourth term, last won re-election in 2018 by 3.5% of the vote.\n\nIndigenous voters have said that political candidates don't often prioritize their communities , but both Sheehy and Tester are hoping tribal support can push them to a narrow victory. Tester, who is widely considered as the most vulnerable Senate Democrat running for re-election, has spent $1 million on tribal-focused voting initiatives.\n\nThere are seven federally recognized Native reservations in Montana, and Native Americans make up 6.4% of the state's population , according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The Crow Indian Reservation is the largest in the state, and the Crow Tribe endorsed Donald Trump's 2020 re-election bid. An MSNBC request for comment to Frank White Clay, the Crow Tribe chairman, was not immediately returned.\n\nClarissa-Jan Lim is a breaking/trending news blogger for MSNBC Digital.

But since June 4, park staffers have not been able to find it and officials are not aware of any other confirmed sightings in the park, one of the last sanctuaries for free-roaming American bison.\n\nRangers that regularly work in the more accessible areas of the park, as well as its backcountry, have not seen the animal, park spokesperson Morgan Warthin said.\n\nNative American leaders earlier this week held a ceremony to honor the sacred birth of the animal and give the name. Lakota members caution that the prophecy tied to the birth of the white buffalo is also a signal that more must be done to protect the earth and its animals.\n\nSuspicion about the calf's fate has grown as weeks have passed without another sighting since its birth in the Lamar Valley, a prime spot for wildlife viewing in Yellowstone. Young buffalo can fall victim to predators, river currents, illness and other hazards.\n\nMike Mease, a co-founder of the Buffalo Field Campaign, a conservation group that works with tribes to protect and honor wild buffalo and hosted this week's ceremony, said he thinks the calf is alive somewhere in the park, away from the roads and walkways most visitors stick to. He said a grizzly bear seen by Yellowstone visitors earlier this month with five cubs, an unusually large brood, has not been seen since either.\n\nBut the most important thing about the white buffalo is that a prophecy, which is both a warning and a blessing, has been fulfilled, Mease said.\n\n\"Whether it's dead or alive, the message has been relayed from the heavens and times are different now. We have to make changes for the future,\" he said.\n\nThe Associated Press\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Gov. Peggy Flanagan of Minnesota would presumably become the first Native American woman to lead a state.\n\nAfter assuming her position in 2019, Flanagan, a member of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, became the highest ranking Native woman elected to an executive office, according to her official bio . She won re-election in 2022 with Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nNow, with Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday tapping Walz as her running mate, a victory against Republican nominee Donald Trump and his r unning mate , Ohio Sen. JD Vance , would propel Flanagan, 44, to the position of Minnesota governor.\n\nWalz's and Flanagan's current term is up for re-election in 2026. But the state Constitution allows Flanagan to assume the governorship if Walz, for whatever reason, vacates office. She would also become Minnesota's first female governor.\n\nIn a post Tuesday on X, Flanagan congratulated Walz in joining Harris.\n\nNative Americans make up just more than 1% of Minnesota's total population, according to census data , with many living on the state's 11 reservations or in its urban centers. The Native vote helped Joe Biden secure a win against Trump in the state in 2020.\n\nIn her high-profile role, Flanagan has been outspoken in support of Indigenous rights, championing this year's change of Minnesota's state flag - the previous design had been criticized for decades for its depiction of Native Americans.\n\nIn 2016, when Flanagan was a state representative, she attended the Democratic National Convention and spoke out against then-nominee Trump, who mock ed Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., by calling her Pocahontas .\n\n\"Your name is not Pocahontas,\" Flanagan said she told her young daughter in a letter. \"You should never let any one make you feel anything less than proud of who you are. So despite everything that has happened to our people, and no matter what Donald Trump says, we are still here.\"\n\nFlanagan had also been outspoken about Trump's policies when he was president. In 2020, when Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump, one of his senior advisers, visited Minnesota for the opening of the nation's first task force office dedicated to solving cold cases of missing and murdered Native Americans and Alaska Natives, Flanagan took issue.\n\n\"Donald Trump made a career demonstrating and celebrating behavior that perpetuates violence against Native women and girls,\" she said at the time .\n\nSince then, Flanagan helped oversee the creation of the state's first Missing and Murdered Indigenous Relatives Office in St. Paul, developed to help families navigate the justice system.\n\n\"It really matters who's at the table, and who's elected,\" she told MinnPost in 2023. \"We finally have Native representation in the governor's office and Native women in the Legislature.\"\n\nHowever, governors with Native American ancestry remain rare: Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt is a member of the Cherokee Nation .\n\nI cover national news. I also focus on racial injustice and social inequality, and cover aspects of the criminal justice system, including judicial misconduct and federal prisons.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Based on David Grann's bestselling book, the story depicts the brutal serial murders of members of the oil-wealthy Osage Nation in 1920s Oklahoma. Given the inherent drama of the narrative and the buzzy casting, the film seems destined for critical success. But will it usher in a new era for Hollywood's Native Americans?\n\nThe film seems destined for critical success. But will it usher in a new era for Hollywood's Native Americans?\n\nThirty-three years ago, Kevin Costner's \"Dances with Wolves\" delivered a watershed moment . After decades of cowboy-and-Indian Westerns, the movie cast Native actors in prominent roles and showed a human dimension to its Native characters.\n\nCostner's epic earned seven Academy Awards, including best picture, and a nomination for Native Canadian actor Graham Greene in a supporting role. The movie also brought in over $400 million worldwide and sparked a mini surge of Native-themed stories, like \"The Last of the Mohicans\" (1992) and \"Geronimo: An American Legend (1993).\" Television mini-series like \"Son of the Morning Star\" (1991) and \"DreamKeeper\" (2003) followed the same pattern. Even Disney jumped on the bandwagon with its animated hit \"Pocahontas\" (1995).\n\nMany Native actors, including Wes Studi, enjoyed a boost in their careers because of \"Dances with Wolves.\" But for all its hype, Costner's epic did not employ Natives Americans in prominent creative roles behind the scenes.\n\nChange in the ensuing decades has been incremental. Television has arguably worked the hardest to increase representation, beginning with the 1990 TNT series \"The Native Americans. Behind the Legends. Beyond the Myths.\" featuring Hanay Geiogamah (Kiowa) as a producer. That same decade brought \"Smoke Signals\" (1998), the theatrical debut of the Cheyenne and Arapaho filmmaker Chris Eyre.\n\nRecently, the streaming series \"Rutherford Falls\" and \"Reservation Dogs\" have employed Native artists in front of and behind the camera, including showrunners Sierra Teller Ornelas (Navajo) and Sterlin Harjo (Seminole).\n\nSadly, \"Rutherford Falls\" was cancelled and \"Reservation Dogs\" will end after its third season .\n\nNow a major motion picture has its chance. \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" has proudly touted Scorsese's collaboration with Osage Principal Chief Geoffrey Standing Bear . To the studio's credit, local Osage talent was hired in various production roles such as the costuming and art departments.\n\nBut no Native American is credited as being involved in the movie's screenwriting, production or directing creative processes. This is an ongoing problem. Back in 2020, the Native American & Indigenous Writers Committee of the Writers Guild of America West addressed this same issue in an open letter advising the industry that merely using Natives as cultural consultants was severely limiting. They need to be hired as writers, directors and producers, too.\n\nThis makes \"Killers of the Flower Moon\" both an interesting case study and ultimately a missed opportunity. The movie has tried to incorporate some Osage input, but it still is telling this story primarily through the lens of the white main character, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. As Variety has pointed out, DiCaprio grabs the lion's share of the screen time. And the camera often lingers on his face, even when other characters are speaking.\n\nPerhaps one bright spot is the movie's female lead.\n\nLily Gladstone, an actress of Blackfeet and Nimíipuu heritage, plays the Osage wife of her slippery husband (DiCaprio) and is already garnering some Oscar buzz.\n\n\"If you're wondering if you should go see this film, at least go see it for Gladstone's performance,\" advised Osage News editor Shannon Shaw Duty in her review .\n\nWith her powerful performance, Gladstone joined a small but important club of Native female actors.\n\nWith her powerful performance, Gladstone joined a small but important club of Native female actors. Elaine Miles stole countless scenes as the unflappable Alaska Native receptionist in 1990s gem \"Northern Exposure.\" Jana Schmieding of \"Rutherford Falls,\" Devery Jacobs and Paulina Alexis of \"Reservation Dogs,\" Sheila Tousey in \"Thunderheart\" (1992), Irene Bedard in \"Lakota Woman: Siege at Wounded Knee\" (TV 1994), and the late Misty Upham in \"Frozen River\" (2008) all won accolades for their portrayals of strong, independent Native women. And Amber Midthunder's starring role as a young Comanche warrior in Hulu's release of \"Prey\" (2022), a prequel to the \"Predator\" series, proved that Native women can carry blockbusters. \"Prey\" was produced by Jhane Myers of the Comanche Nation; she was nominated for a Producers Guild Award and a Primetime Emmy Award .\n\nGladstone's presence and strength may very well continue to open doors for Hollywood's Native women. But without Native American artists behind the camera in prominent positions, as well as in front of it, Hollywood will struggle to tell Native stories authentically - or without centering and privileging whiteness. Lily Gladstone deserves better, just like the real Osage victims of this white supremacist reign of terror did all those decades ago.\n\nAngela Aleiss is a film historian and former contributing writer at Indian Country Today.

      "text": "Let us give thanks for democracy as well this Thanksgiving\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nIn 1744, leaders of the Iroquois Confederacy met with representatives of several British colonies to negotiate a treaty. One of the Native Americans, an Onondaga diplomat named Canassatego, pointed out that the colonies could learn from their alliance, which dated back hundreds of years.\n\n\"Our wise Forefathers established Union and Amity between the Five Nations; this has made us formidable, this has given us great weight and Authority with our Neighboring Nations,\" he said . \"We are a powerful confederacy, and, by your observing the same Methods our wise Forefathers have taken, you will acquire fresh Strength and Power.\"\n\nThe speech was included in a collection printed by Benjamin Franklin, who later mused in a 1751 letter to a friend that it would be \"a very strange Thing\" if the six nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, also known as the Haudenosaunee, were able to form a union and not \"ten or a Dozen English Colonies.\"\n\nThese are some of the facts cited by supporters of the Iroquois influence theory, which holds that the Native American alliance was an inspiration for the U.S. Constitution . Its adherents further point to similarities in everything from federalism and the impeachment process to the use of the bald eagle and a bundle of arrows as symbols.\n\nWithin the field of history, this theory is a subject of some dispute. Historians have picked apart various pieces of evidence and claims about the specific influences that the Iroquois may have had on the delegates to the constitutional convention. And to be fair, some of the scholarship put forward for the Iroquois influence over the years has been overstated or thinly sourced , though no one would argue that the framers were not aware of the Iroquois example.\n\nThe Europeans who came to North America were from countries that had largely run into an authoritarian dead end.\n\nAs Kirke Kickingbird, co-author of \"Indians and the United States Constitution,\" once said , imagining that the framers weren't influenced by Native Americans would be like saying the Germans and the French didn't know each other. That influence is worth contemplating on Thanksgiving, a day that acknowledges the debt that all Americans owe to the people who were here first.\n\nThe Europeans who came to North America were from countries that had largely run into an authoritarian dead end, overseen by rulers with absolute powers to dictate how their subjects lived and died. Here, the European settlers discovered a vast array of alternatives, including hereditary rulers, ones chosen only after careful debate, leaders who governed by consensus as well as those whose powers were limited to the hunting season or by a tribal council.\n\nEven those Europeans who wanted to defend their system had to grapple with the existence of these alternatives in America in philosophical treatises that in turn influenced American democracy.\n\nMany responded by inaccurately casting Native Americans as living in a sort of anarchy, a \"state of nature\" that, they implied or outright declared, European society had outgrown. English philosopher Thomas Hobbes, whose \"Leviathan\" defends the absolute powers of a king, described the lives of such unfortunates as \"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short\" as they lacked the supposed comforts of an all-powerful ruler.\n\nBut reformers, too, were preoccupied with America. As he outlined his objections to the divine right of kings in his \"Two Treatises of Government,\" the English philosopher John Locke described life before the invention of private property by comparing it to the New World. \"In the beginning,\" he wrote , \"all the world was America.\" Other Enlightenment thinkers such as Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Montesquieu also wrote about the state of nature in ways that made it clear they were thinking about America, too.\n\nThere are plenty of differences, of course, between the Iroquois Confederacy and the U.S. Constitution. The framers of Constitution were also influenced by European sources as varied as ancient Greece, the Roman Republic, the Hanseatic League and Swiss cantons. And the Enlightenment was driven by the spread of coffeehouses and libraries and the rise of a middle-class merchant class, among other things. But to acknowledge all these influences does not mean rejecting the notion that Native Americans were also in the mix.\n\nThe encounter between Europeans and Native Americans that began in the 15th century changed both forever profoundly, in ways both good and bad. The introduction of the horse allowed the Plains Indians to flourish, while diseases like smallpox wiped out entire tribes . Europeans picked up new staple crops like potatoes and tomatoes as well as an addiction to tobacco. Sequoyah was inspired to create the Cherokee written language, while European military strategists were influenced by Native American battlefield tactics .\n\nIt's clear that this also included an exchange of ideas on how people should be governed and the proper limits of power that we are still grappling with today. So as we give thanks for the turkey and the corn this Thanksgiving, let us also take a moment to appreciate the gift of these ideas as well.\n\nRyan Teague Beckwith is a newsletter editor for MSNBC.

Activate your online access\n\nDemocrats in Indian Country are organizing under a slogan: \"Voting is sacred.\" But some Native Americans wonder why they should participate in a system that ignores them.\n\n\"Are you going to vote?\" I asked Diannah Reid, a full-blooded Navajo and a survivor of an Indian boarding school. She has scars on the back of her hand where her teacher would smack her with a ruler when she spoke her language.\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"Why? If I do, are they going to give us the land back?\"\n\nDuring the presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, Black and Hispanic Americans were mentioned, but Native Americans were not.\n\n\"They don't see us,\" she said. \"Just our existence alone makes them uncomfortable. They know they're on stolen land-all of them-and voting is not sacred.\"\n\nReid, 31, was referencing a slogan and movement led by young Native Democrats in Indian Country that proclaims, \"Voting is sacred.\"\n\nShe said democracy existed in what people call \"the New World\" long before colonial invasion, and on the reservation voting \"in the old way\" is sacred. \"White people love to say the Greeks gave us democracy,\" she said. \"We had it here for centuries before they ever accidentally stumbled to our lands.\"\n\n\"But I'll play along,\" she said. \"So, if I vote, will they abolish Columbus Day? Will they give the Black Hills back to the Lakota or stop poisoning our water with fracking? Of course they won't.\" (Harris said during the presidential debate that as president she would not ban fracking.)\n\nReid, who was born on the Navajo Nation in an area called the Western Agency, said the erasure of Indigenous voices is evident in speeches by both presidential candidates and in the news media. \"Watch MSNBC,\" she said. \"How many Natives do they have on there? Did they mention that asshole who said we're drunk at 8 am and throw Coors cans? No.\"\n\nRecently audio of Tim Sheehy speaking at a private fundraiser in 2023 leaked. In it, the Trump-backed Republican candidate trying to oust Montana's Democratic senator, Jon Tester , referred to Native Americans as drunks.\n\n\"Great way to bond with all the Indians, to be out there while they're drunk at 8 am ,\" he said , talking about the Crow Nation. \"They let you know whether they like you or not-there's Coors Light cans flying by your head riding by.\"\n\nSheehy has yet to issue an apology for his comments.\n\nIn Montana, the Native vote could help the Democrats keep the Senate; Native Americans make up about 6.5 percent of the state's population, enough to sway a close election. Yet Tester is starting to fall behind Sheehy, according to polls . If Sheehy wins, it could shift the Senate from blue to red.\n\nRegarding Sheehy, Reid told me that \"when it comes to Natives you can be as racist as you want in America and get away with it. Just look at the [Kansas City] Chiefs and the tomahawk chop. It's American racism on prime-time TV and clearly in politics.\"\n\nJeet Heer\n\nBooks & the Arts / Brett Christophers\n\nBooks & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins\n\nElie Mystal\n\nIn the media, displays of Native Americans as Indian mascots are ubiquitous, but on the hard news side, there is almost no Native representation. It's either racist caricatures or nothing at all. I was told again and again that this can and does translate to Natives, especially young Natives, deciding not to vote in presidential elections. To feel like voting matters, you have to feel seen, and many Natives don't.\n\nDuring the 2020 presidential election, for example, CNN listed white, Latino, Black, and Asian, but Natives were counted as \" something else .\" Elders across the country were livid, because they feared that the erasure of this country's first peoples from the media could dissuade Natives from voting in a presidential election.\n\nSonny Skyhawk, a Sicangu Lakota and an advocate for broad representation of Natives in media, said Americans' subconscious dislike of Indians is born from Hollywood, specifically Western movies. \"They had to create a bad guy, and we're still that bad guy,\" he said.\n\nWith regard to mainstream news pundits' rarely mentioning the racist comments by Sheehy, Skyhawk said, \"To them, we're not important enough to consult with.\"\n\nAnd according to NBC Universal, only 0.4 percent of its workforce identifies as Native-self-identified \"Indians\"-meaning anyone on staff can claim to be Native American by checking the box, including people known in Indian Country as \"box-checkers\" or \"high-cheekboners.\"\n\nSkyhawk, 80, does, though, disagree with Reid on one topic-voting. He believes voting can do some good for Natives: \"Native peoples aren't part of the equation, and consequently don't participate, but you have to participate in the system in order to make the system change and create that change.\"\n\nElections in many Native nations and tribes are very different from ones at the US state and federal level. For instance, voting for the Lakota begins with the women's council. For centuries, women have chosen the candidates. It's a sacred process, not only because it's an ancient practice but also because it's tied to Lakota spirituality.\n\nIt also makes sense politically, Walt Pourier, an Oglala Lakota artist, told me. \"There is no better judge of a man's character than a woman,\" he said. \"Men like to pound their chests and be manly with one another. Women know your vulnerabilities and weaknesses behind closed doors. And they'll tell you if you're weak and vulnerable; they know if you're the kind to lead. So they ultimately chose our chiefs.\"\n\nPourier's daughter, Leala, 23, said, \"The [American] system doesn't include us-Natives.\" She said that while \"we can't have a Trump,\" Harris's position on the genocide in Palestine is why she hasn't decided if she'll vote this November.\n\n\"They're demonizing Indigenous peoples here and across the sea,\" she said. \"For me, it comes down to Palestine.\" Leala said if Harris and Trump can't and won't acknowledge the genocide of Palestinians, how will either ever acknowledge the genocide of Natives on the land they live on?\n\n\"You can't even acknowledge the Natives here, and you're being complacent with genocide in Gaza,\" Leala said.\n\nYet Allie Young-a fellow full-blooded Navajo, a screenwriter and founder of \"Ride to the Polls,\" a campaign where Natives ride on horseback and go door-to-door across the rez to encourage voting this presidential election-said that even though white people have yet to wholeheartedly believe in the Native vote, \"we're still showing our political power.\"\n\n\"But MSNBC?\" I asked. \"Oh, yeah, them. Well, we're fighting to be seen,\" she replied.\n\nDeb Haaland, the secretary of the interior and a citizen of the Laguna Pueblo in New Mexico, wrote in an op-ed in Indianz that she believes voting is sacred and that \"we must use our voices in every election.\"\n\nHaaland, who in 2020 became the first Native appointed as a cabinet secretary, added that Indigenous people would honor their ancestors by voting, including in the US presidential elections: \"Our ancestors and relatives survived against seemingly insurmountable odds, which is why we owe it to them to make our voices heard at the ballot box.\"\n\nRae Fancher, the first Alaska Native female to graduate from the Naval Academy, will vote this year, but she understands why other Alaska Natives won't. She said she also feels invisible to the news media and politicians. \"I can't remember the last news story that had Alaska Natives as it's focal point,\" she said. \"I've gotten, 'I thought you all were dead' multiple times throughout my life-my people as a whole are taught as past tense.\"\n\nShe told me, \"To vote is important and vital, but white people are going to get what white people want.\" Fancher added that she'll vote for Harris in November, if only to protect her ancestral home from extractive industries in northern Alaska: \"So we can protect our way of life, the way we've lived for thousands of years.\"\n\nReid, like many others I spoke with, said the mainstream media ignores Native voices, and that when you're disregarded, when so much of the media is willfully oblivious to your political desires, why would participating in the electoral process be sacred? Why, Reid wondered, would you participate at all? \"You don't see us? Fuck you back,\" she said.\n\nIndigenous people, old and young, are working diligently across the country to get out the Native vote, but on November 5, Reid will do something that she considers more productive-\"some self-care.\"\n\n\"I'll probably sit at a coffee shop and sketch,\" she said. \"Others can vote for a president if they want. I'm not obligated.\"\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

We've seen bans on teaching Martin Luther King's writing, or reading books about Ruby Bridges-essentially any discussions of historical or current racism. Yet we shouldn't overlook how this manufactured moral panic affects Native American communities. Many of the laws passed by GOP-led state legislatures include language that has a direct effect on teaching about indigenous people, colonization, Western expansion, Native sovereignty and more. Rebecca Nagle, a Cherokee writer, activist and host of the This Land podcast, said that panic over CRT is just the latest version of an old reaction. \"I feel like fear of history being told more accurately has been around for a long time,\" said Nagle, citing pushback against things like The New York Times ' 1619 Project, the removal of Confederate statues, or efforts to recognize Indigenous People's Day instead of Columbus Day . \"For a long time in the United States, there's been a reluctance to tell the fullness of our history-the good and the bad.\" Related Articles The GOP's Grievance Industrial Complex Invades the Classroom Jennifer C.

Activate your online access\n\nThe Department of Justice recently argued that birthright citizenship does not apply to Native Americans. The administration will likely take aim at Native sovereignty next.\n\nActivists and members of different tribes from the region protest in Keystone, South Dakota, on July 3, 2020, as they demonstrate around the Mount Rushmore National Monument and the visit of President Donald Trump.\n\nI received a flurry of calls, e-mails, texts, and direct messages from political junkies when news broke that the Trump administration had called into question the birthright citizenship of us \"Indians\" or Natives with a capital \"N\" or Indigenous with a capital \"I\"-we who were here first.\n\n\"Where the hell are they going to send you!?\" a former classmate asked. \"China!?\"\n\nLate last month-as part of the legal defense of Trump's order to suspend birthright citizenship-the Justice Department cited a 19th-century case arguing that \"Indians\" should be excluded from birthright citizenship.\n\nWhile the 14th Amendment declares that \"all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside,\" the Justice Department posited that since a law passed two years prior explicitly excluded \"Indians,\" then so too does the 14th Amendment.\n\nIn the Justice Department filing , government lawyers cite the US Citizenship Act of 1866, which states \"that all persons born in the United States and not subject to any foreign power, excluding Indians not taxed, are hereby declared to be citizens of the United States.\"\n\nIt's imperative to remember how the US government regarded us at that time. The white man called us \"injuns\" and \"savages,\" and was building and forcing Indigenous families into a prison-camp system, which Adolf Hitler would later praise and discuss with his aides and generals prior to the Holocaust. You've probably heard of the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota, but you probably only know it by its softer, more palatable name. Its official title is Prison Camp 334.\n\nIn the filing, Trump's lawyers reference Elk v. Wilkins , an 1884 case in which the Supreme Court ruled that \"Indians\" born on reservations were not automatically US citizens. The Justice Department argued then and by extension argues again now that because enrolled \"Indians\" of federally recognized tribes owe their primary allegiance to their chiefs, tribal presidents, and elders, \"Indians\" are not \"subject to the jurisdiction\" of states like South Dakota or Arizona, or even of the United States itself.\n\nThe Justice Department wrote in January: \"[This] confirms that the children of non-resident aliens lack a constitutional birthright to citizenship. In Elk , the Court held that, because members of Indian tribes owe 'immediate allegiance' to their tribes, they are not 'subject to the jurisdiction' of the United States and are not constitutionally entitled to citizenship.\"\n\nThis legal gymnastics are dizzying, but we've been here before. The government's use of sophistry and legalese to try to fog the frontal cortex is an all-too-familiar tactic to Indigenous peoples. This is how white men stole billions of acres from our ancestors; they drafted legal documents in that foreign language called English, drowned them in whiskey and gin (something, at the time, our elders had no experience with or understanding of) by the fire, and then got them to sign away all their land, water, and almost anything resembling an inalienable human right.\n\nBut, according to today's experts in Indian law, Trump cannot strip Natives of our US citizenship because of the Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 , which officially certified \"Indians\" as US citizens.\n\n\"What I think Trump is trying to do is analogize,\" explained Steven McSloy, a Columbia law professor who specializes in American Indian law. The Trump team needs to point to historical examples of noncitizens born in the US, so \"they're reaching deep into history to find examples of noncitizens when for a long, long time I don't think those examples existed, certainly not for Native people.\"\n\nHe added, \"They need to figure out who was excluded in the 14th Amendment and try to apply it today.\"\n\nMcSloy said that no matter what race you are, if you're a US citizen, you have a right to due process. \"If I did really bad things, I can go to jail, but you can't de-citizen me without me being a traitor; there's got to be a whole procedure if you're going to revoke my US citizenship,\" he said. \"That's a fundamental constitutional right that I have no matter what bad thing I did. You could execute me, but I'd still be a citizen on the day you execute me.\"\n\nJeet Heer\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nTrump is unlikely to successfully strip Natives of citizenship, but he may take aim at our sovereignty, i.e., our designation as separate, sovereign nations. This would allow him to take Native lands and sell them to oil and gas conglomerates. This would also nullify treaties between us and the US government.\n\n\"Can he do that?\" I asked.\n\n\"Always,\" McSloy responded. \"At that level, they can do whatever they want.\" He quoted Justice Stephen Breyer in United States v. Lara when Breyer said that while Indian nations are sovereign, \"it's like a grip. [The US] can tighten or relax its grip on tribal sovereignty whenever it wants.\"\n\nIn 1953, Congress passed the Indian Termination Act , which ended the government-to-government relationship between the US and tribes. It was later overturned at the behest of then-President Richard Nixon.\n\nThat act was intended to assimilate Natives into major cities, but should the US Supreme Court allow something similar today, it could strip Natives of our sovereignty and then designate tribes and nations (reservations and Alaska Native villages) as counties within its respective state, as the US has before.\n\n\"The [Termination Act] said, 'OK, you used to be the Winnebago [Tribe]. Now, you're the County of Winnebago, and all your people are the citizens of the County of Winnebago, and you better pay your taxes to the state, because the trust responsibility is gone, your treaties are gone,'\" McSloy said. \"Luckily, that didn't last.\"\n\nIf this happens again in 2025, it would make available to Trump millions of acres of Indigenous lands held in trust by the federal government. Then Trump, as he puts it, would be free to \"drill, baby, drill\" on those lands.\n\nMeanwhile, ICE officials are harassing and rounding up Natives throughout the country, particularly in the Southwest. Tribal governments have issued statements preparing their citizens and advising them to carry their tribal identification, specifically their Certificate of Degree of Indian Blood (CDIB) cards.\n\nFrighteningly, should the president, Congress, or the Supreme Court repeal the sovereign status of Indigenous nations and tribes, CDIB cards could become null and void. Additionally, moneys allocated to tribes for services such as clean water, housing improvement and development, education, and the life-saving Indian Health Service (IHS) could also end.\n\n\"Those patients would completely suffer,\" said Dr. Sarah Bridge, an emergency room physician at the IHS in Gallup, New Mexico. Her patients include citizens of the Navajo Nation and all the nearby pueblos. \"There would be nowhere for them to go.\n\nBridge said Indian Health Services is also a major employer for Natives on the nearby reservations, and without her staff, should the funding end, the IHS system would collapse.\n\n\"If they lose their jobs, they're going to be completely and financially devastated for themselves and their families, and then the hospital won't be able to run. I don't even know how I'd be able to do my job,\" she said.\n\nAnd still, the calls and texts and e-mails and direct messages from pals and strangers continue. \"Wait, how is it that people who've been here for thousands of years are now not considered US citizens?\" a white woman asked me one morning after reading my black \"You Are on Stolen Land\" beanie.\n\n\"Our creation stories come from this land. Our languages were invented on this land. White people here can't say the same.... So, while we predate America, we're still American citizens.\"\n\nOur status as US citizens is unlikely to change. But the Trump administration's thirst for oil and other resources means the US government could try to steal our lands from under us-all over again.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

They asked us if we could, working with tribal leaders, create a thoughtful, respectful, and stimulating program that would begin to look at some of the current community initiatives, energetic activist work, legal challenges and cultural engagement of Native peoples in the U.S.  A journey where we could hear firsthand from the community about their past struggles, their current lives and their aspirations for the future.\n\nOur goal for this program is to listen and to learn: to hear directly from Native Americans without the questionable filters of history writers, mainstream media representations, even well-intentioned progressive journalists.  We reached out to tribal leaders and learned that many in the community are anxious to be heard, to challenge misconceptions, and to share their good work and promising programs.\n\nOur itinerary focuses on just a few geographical areas: the Dakotas and Colorado, where we hope to gain insight into important aspects of the Hidatsa, Mandan, Lakota, Dakota, Ute, Navajo, Apache and Kiowa Nations.\n\nIt's a rich nine-day program that just begins to scratch the surface of these complex cultures.  We'll travel through dramatic Western landscapes peppered with rich historical sites as we meet with community and tribal leaders, story-tellers, artists, musicians and activists  - focusing on listening to what they want to tell us, on understanding their hopes for the future, and facing the shameful legacy of the U.S.'s brutal history of eradication and oppression. We hope to have the privilege of hearing singular voices that have been silenced for too long.\n\nTour Hosts\n\nDakota Wind Goodhouse: Dakota is an enrolled member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and a Native American Studies instructor at United Tribes Technical College, which is owned and operated by the three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold, the Spirit Lake Tribe, the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, and the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians. Dakota will be with the group from Bismarck to Denver.\n\nBird Red: A Southern Ute tribal member and a Ute singer who works at the Southern Ute Community Center, Bird was part of the documentary \" Spirit of the Peaks \" a film about the struggle for balance between two worlds.

Rain slaps the roof. Ear buds dangle from one girl's left ear. Two more students whisper, sharing a joke. Still another student, his face set in a serious expression, stares at the screen before him. The one teacher in the room previously taught third grade; he's certified to teach high-school continuing education and agricultural science. Nearly all of the young people who study in this trailer-officially called the Bridges Career and Technical High School at Warm Springs-are Native Americans. Bridges is a public school, created as an alternative for teens who aren't on track to graduate, or who have been repeatedly suspended or expelled from the large, diverse high school in the town of Madras-\"up there,\" as the residents of the reservation call it. 1 This article was reported in partnership with InvestigateWest, a nonprofit journalism studio in the Pacific Northwest. Here in the Jefferson County 509J School District, more than a third of all American Indian students in sixth through 12th grades were suspended at least once during the 2015-16 school year, making them more than twice as likely to be suspended from school as their white peers. Native Americans make up one-third of the district's student population but receive nearly two-thirds of the expulsions. They are the kids that the district has \"thrown away,\" said Dawn Smith, a former elementary-school teacher and administrator who worked for the district for nearly 30 years. 2 Savannah Holliday, a poised 18-year-old who lives on the Warm Springs reservation, was expelled in each year of middle school, once after fighting with another student who, Holliday said, called her a racial slur. After she was kicked out, Holliday's only option was to attend virtual classes like those offered in the trailer at Warm Springs. The computer-taught lessons weren't very engaging, Holliday said, and she still doesn't understand many basic math concepts. \"I missed out on a lot of learning opportunities. You were kind of on your own-they'd have people watching you, but sometimes, if we asked for help, they couldn't help.\" Many of her classmates who were suspended or expelled eventually dropped out of school altogether. When I asked Holliday if she could introduce me to some of them, she texted back: \"Most of them are pregnant, parents, addicted to drugs, moved away or dead...so would be hard for me to contact them.\" 3 Last year, less than two-thirds of the tribal members who were enrolled as seniors in the 509J School District graduated. Warm Springs Tribal Councilwoman Carina Miller, who graduated from the district in 2005, is concerned that Native students aren't receiving an equal education. The administrators \"don't see us as people deserving the same sort of education and opportunities,\" she said. Miller was suspended several times herself, once for swearing; a white student once called her a \"prairie nigger.\" As a student, she added, \"I felt worthless-like I wasn't worth the effort or patience to understand who I am and my history. This school district has failed us my entire lifetime, and it continues to do this today.\" 4 Warm Springs is not an outlier in this. Across the country, American Indian and Alaska Native students are disciplined more than most other racial groups, and they have a dropout rate twice the national average, resulting in what academic experts call a nationwide \"crisis\" for Native students. Many tribal leaders and education experts say these dismal statistics reflect, at worst, overt discrimination-and, at best, the alienation that Native students feel in a school system that has few Native teachers overall as well as limited lessons on Native American history and culture. For decades, the US Congress has allocated money to enhance the learning opportunities for Native students, who are among the poorest in the nation. But that amount is steadily declining on a per-pupil basis, and there is little oversight of how the money is actually used. 5 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer Want to Understand the New Cold War?

Books & the Arts / Brett Christophers This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal When the United States signed its treaties with the Indian tribes, stripping them of their land, it promised to provide public services-including education-to tribal members in perpetuity. \"For too long, the federal leadership has failed to honor that sacred pledge, leaving generations of Native children behind,\" said Washington State Senator John McCoy, a citizen of the Tulalip tribe and a national leader in Native education reform. \"Institutionalized assimilation and racism remain embedded within our public schools.\" 6 I n public schools across the country, American Indian and Alaska Native students are more likely to be suspended than any other racial group, with the exception of African Americans. According to a 2015 report by the University of California at Los Angeles's Center for Civil Rights Remedies, Native students are disciplined at roughly two times the rate of their white peers. And though they represent approximately 1 percent of the student population, they account for 2 percent of all school arrests and 3 percent of all incidents referred by school staff to law enforcement, according to 2014 data collected by the National Congress of American Indians. Native students also disproportionately attend virtual schools like Bridges, according to an analysis conducted for this article by UCLA. Recent studies show that most students who attend these schools learn less math or reading than their peers in traditional public schools. (More than 90 percent of American Indian students attend public schools, while a majority of the rest attend schools administered by the Bureau of Indian Education, where students have some of the lowest graduation rates and test scores nationwide.) 7 Current Issue View our current issue The high levels of poverty on Native American reservations do create barriers to educational success. But a number of studies have shown that, even when researchers control for poverty, race still determines whether students are more harshly disciplined in the public-school system-and students of all ethnicities who are suspended or expelled are more likely to leave school for good, a phenomenon that researchers refer to as being \"pushed out.\" 8 Frequent suspensions or expulsions can also lead to gaps in learning, a cycle reflected in the poor math and reading scores of Native students on a national level. Native students are less likely to graduate in four years than any other racial group; by the time they reach their senior year, only 10 percent are proficient in math, according to the results compiled for the year 2015 by the National Assessment of Educational Progress. (Less than 5 percent of Native 11th graders in Oregon's 509J School District met math-proficiency levels in 2016.) 9 Harsh discipline and low graduation rates can limit the economic and social opportunities for students beyond their teenage years. Low graduation rates contribute to high unemployment on reservations, as well as diminished levels of home ownership. Though Native Americans are regularly omitted from national studies, in large part due to their small population size, studies of other minority groups have found that being expelled or dropping out of school is also associated with higher incarceration rates. Plus the suicide rate among Native teens is one and a half times higher than the national average, according to the Centers for Disease Control; it's likely that negative experiences in school, including expulsion or suspension, are associated with this epidemic, said Dr. R. Dale Walker, the director of Oregon Health and Science University's Center for American Indian Health Education and Research. 10 Last year, less than two-thirds of the tribal members enrolled in the 509J School District graduated. \"Why the heck aren't we doing better, and why has it taken so long? I just go, 'Ugh!'\" said Rick Molitor, the superintendent of the 509J School District for the past nine years. (He retired on July 1.) Molitor adds that the high disciplinary rates stem, in large part, from a lack of cultural understanding among teachers. In the past two years, he's been working with the Warm Springs tribe to increase cultural programming in the schools, and he credits new facilities and programs like Bridges with helping to increase the graduation rate. Even so, \"we have a long ways to go,\" he acknowledged. \"I've been going out to Warm Springs and saying, 'We're failing our Native American kids.' There's no way we can come forward and say we're being successful.\" 11 I n late June, the ACLU of Montana supported a formal complaint with both the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice alleging that a school district in rural Montana discriminates against students who are citizens of the Assiniboine and Sioux nations. \"Native students have been systematically disadvantaged in comparison to their non-Native peers through racially biased enforcement of school discipline policies, inequitable access to school activities, and verbal abuse by teachers and staff,\" attorney Melina Healey asserted in a statement announcing the complaint. (Schools receiving public money are required to abide by federal anti-discrimination laws, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.) 12 The Montana complaint also alleges that the district mismanages the Native-specific federal funding that is allocated by Congress to support Native students and fulfill treaty obligations. Many tribes describe this money as critical for their students. Without it, kids in places like Putnam City, Oklahoma, might go without backpacks, calculators, or caps and gowns at graduation. Districts in other states use the funds to support students by sponsoring Native American clubs, powwows, and Native music or language classes. 13 Despite their importance, these federal funding programs are loosely managed. The Johnson O'Malley program, created in 1934 to fund basic educational needs of Native students, disperses money based on the number of enrolled tribal members attending public school. Congress hasn't completed the necessary population survey since 1994, while the number of Native students has grown by approximately 4 percent per year-meaning that the same pool of money authorized in 1994 must now cover far more children. In 1995, the federal government allocated $125 per student; last year, the allotment was just $63.80. President Trump's proposed budget would cut program spending even further, by 30 percent. Over a year ago, Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota introduced a bill that would update the survey; it hasn't gotten out of committee. 14 The other major source of federal money specifically earmarked for Native students are Title VI grants, which school districts use to enhance the educational experience of Native kids through things like music or language classes. The US Department of Education conducts only cursory audits of the program, and it fails to ensure that the money is targeted specifically to Native students, rather than the student body at large. 15 Tribal members in other areas share the Assiniboine and Sioux nations' concern about mismanagement of this funding, which amounts to more than $100 million each year nationally. Attempts to learn how Oregon's 509J School District and others use the funds revealed a lack of transparency and oversight. \"Many tribes are regularly concerned about how exactly districts are spending the money intended to help our children,\" said Quinton Roman Nose, executive director of the Tribal Education Departments National Assembly, via e-mail. \"Often when we ask for specific details on where the money goes, we get a broad budget that doesn't provide answers to questions being asked by tribes and parents. Ultimately, there's the golden rule: He who has the gold rules. And the schools are the grantees; they've got the money, and they can do with it whatever they want.\" 16 T he roots of the current crisis in American Indian education were planted 138 years ago, when the great-great-great-grandparents of today's students were children. Seen as an enlightened alternative to genocide, the federal government and a network of churches created hundreds of Indian boarding schools intended to assimilate Native Americans and eradicate their culture. If Native parents didn't send their children away to these schools, agents of the Department of the Interior were authorized to arrest them or withhold food (provided in exchange for land), which for most families meant starvation. 17 I felt worthless-like I wasn't worth the effort or patience to understand who I am or my history.\" -Warm Springs Councilwoman Carina Miller \"Education affords the true solution to the Indian problem...only by complete isolation of the Indian child from his savage antecedents can he be satisfactorily educated,\" Indian School Superintendent John B. Riley declared in 1886. In these boarding schools, which persisted into the 1970s, Native children weren't allowed to speak their own language, practice their culture, or see their family on a regular basis. Some students were physically or sexually abused by their teachers or dormitory supervisors. Many returned to their families and tribal communities deeply scarred. Dr. Susan Faircloth, a professor of education at the University of North Carolina, Wil- mington, and a member of the Coharie tribe, pointed out that this history \"make[s] it difficult, if not impossible, for many American Indian families and their children to fully engage with schools and educators.\" 18 Today, there are no Native classroom teachers or administrators at Madras High School, the large public school serving the Warm Springs reservation. \"The reason why behaviors are so bad here in this district is that teachers aren't culturally aware,\" said Ellise David, a senior at the school, which has a student body that is one-third Native American, one-third Hispanic, and one-third white. David, a member of the school board and the Indian Education Committee for the tribe, added that many teachers don't understand the challenges that Native students and their families face-for example, getting to a teacher conference on time if they don't have a car. \"I hate teachers who are more like, 'I'm only here to teach-I'm not here to know your family,'\" David said. \"Being aware of what the students go through-not just Native students, but Hispanics too-will help the teachers manage their classrooms.\" 19 Most of the parents, teachers, and students in Warm Springs whom I interviewed for this story were afraid that if they were quoted, the district would somehow punish them. One teacher that I interviewed on background was placed on administrative leave, ostensibly out of concern that she had shared confidential information about students during our conversation, according to an investigator that the district hired, who contacted me. (She hadn't.) 20 Again, the lack of Native teachers and administrators isn't unique to Madras. Less than 1 percent of educators nationwide are American Indian or Alaska Native. This is a real problem, because having teachers of one's own race can be a key to educational success: A recent study of 100,000 black students found that if they had at least one African-American teacher between third and fifth grade, their chances of dropping out declined by 29 percent. Though the Office of Indian Education has a grant program intended to create more Native teachers and administrators, the program is mismanaged, according to a 2010 audit by the Department of Education inspector general's office-leading to waste, fraud, and abuse, as well as a failure to fund projects that conduct significant training. (The OIE declined to answer whether it had made any reforms since the audit.) 21 This dearth of Native teachers is mirrored by the lack of lessons about Native Americans taught to public-school students across the country. Eighty-seven percent of the references to American Indians in the various state academic standards, upon which textbooks are based, concern events that happened before 1900, according to one 2015 study; only Arizona, Washington, Oklahoma, and Kansas teach about the boarding schools. Though the situation is better than it was 50 years ago, Native American content in school textbooks still perpetuates cultural stereotypes, while few textbooks convey the tribal perspectives on historical events and cultural concerns, according to a 2012 survey. (For example, some Nebraska textbooks have described American Indians as lazy and drunk.) 22 \"For more than a century, we've made Natives understand the non-Native culture and adjust accordingly, and it does not work. It's not reciprocal-it's assimilation,\" said Ahniwake Rose, executive director of the National Indian Education Association. \"Native students are often only shown small and very specific reflections of themselves in school-usually lesson plans around the 'Thanksgiving story,' or 'Indian pride' in the context of a school mascot. These reflections are so wrong, so totally off base, that our students disengage from learning.\" 23 For both Native and non-Native teachers who want to help their Native students thrive, there is a paucity of available research to guide their efforts. Because of their relatively small numbers in the overall population, Native students often don't get studied. Indian educational leaders refer to themselves as the \"Asterisk Nation\": \"an asterisk, instead of [a] data point, is often used in data displays,\" reports the National Congress of American Indians. 24 Without reliable data and research, government agencies at every level don't know how to fix problems or allocate funds. This lack of understanding filters down to the classrooms of local schools, where teachers and administrators are often ignorant about their Native students. For example, Warm Springs and other tribes hold funeral ceremonies that last for several weeks; some school districts expel students who miss so many classes. According to a 2013 Office for Civil Rights complaint made by California's Wiyot tribe against the local school district for a range of mistreatment, teachers regularly touched their Native students' long hair, which is culturally offensive. 25 Native students are disciplined at roughly two times the rate of their white peers. L ast winter, I watched Laura Lynn, an educational trainer and professor at the University of Washington's new Native Education Certificate program, teach a fifth-grade lesson on colonization. She studied a crayon drawing made by a student who'd been asked to depict a place that was sacred to her. \"I like this part of the beach you made,\" Lynn said, ripping off a corner of the paper. The class grew silent. She continued to tear the paper. \"I think I'll keep it.\" 26 Lynn's students were actually middle- and high-school teachers attending a series of statewide training sessions mandated by a state law-long on the books but only fully funded last year-that requires school districts to teach the history, government, and culture of their local tribes, using curriculums created and vetted by tribal people. \"To come out of high school and not learn about the colonization of Native people is not right.\" 27 Research shows that Native kids are more likely to thrive, to stay out of trouble and stay in school, when they learn about their culture and language. To that end, a small but growing number of states like Washington now encourage or require that Indian Education be taught to all students, at all levels of schooling. To expand such teaching nationwide, this past spring the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian launched Native Knowledge 360, a free online resource of interactive lessons and educational resources that teachers of all grades and subject areas can use. 28 Related Article A Right-Wing Think Tank Is Trying to Bring Down the Indian Child Welfare Act. Why? Rebecca Clarren Kids also need champions and advocates, said Sheldon Spotted Elk, director of Indian Child Welfare at Casey Family Programs. He pointed to the work of Eileen Quintana, a celebrated Title VI administrator in Utah who, through her Ute dancing classes and dedication to students, is credited with raising American Indian graduation rates in her district from 37 percent when she started 20 years ago to 100 percent last year. A bill introduced earlier this year in the US Senate aims to develop more such teachers: It creates incentives, such as loan forgiveness and scholarships, for teachers who work in schools with a large population of Native students. 29 In 2016, the Obama administration signed a law that for the first time requires school districts to engage in \"timely and meaningful consultation [with tribes] on issues affecting American Indian and Alaska Native students\" or risk losing federal aid. Such partnerships may help to keep Native kids in school and supported. For example, the Chickasaw Nation, based in Oklahoma, now receives notification from the school district when students are truant, triggering a tribally led process to contact families and provide wraparound services for the students to keep them in school. 30 So far, the Trump administration hasn't shown interest in improving the circumstances for Native students. Instead, the budget proposed by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos would eliminate more than $4 billion from the programs that support Native kids. DeVos advocates a voucher system, which would provide students with public money to attend private schools. But to use these vouchers, most tribal students would have to travel more than 70 miles round-trip to get to and from school. DeVos also promotes virtual schools like the trailer in Warm Springs, where students learn primarily from computer programs. 31 B ack on the Warm Springs reservation, the incoming superintendent of the 509J School District, Ken Parshall, told me that he is \"passionate about making brighter outcomes for my students.\" A pilot program launched this past year helps the current support staff earn a teaching license; one Native teacher from that program is now applying for a job with the district. 32 Failure doesn't have to be a destiny for Native American students. Savannah Holliday, the student who was expelled in every year of middle school, went on to receive a full scholarship to Southern Oregon University, where she plans to study forensic pathology. She credited her success to her mother and her participation in a traditional-dancing group. 33 When we met, Holliday was wearing her traditional dress, bedecked with purple and blue beads and shells. \"In order to be successful, you need to know who you are,\" she said. \"The dances help me identify who I am and where I come from. Everything at Madras High School is not of my culture, but at dance practice I fit in, and I feel less alone.\" 34\n\nThis article was reported in partnership with InvestigateWest, a nonprofit journalism studio in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nHere in the Jefferson County 509J School District, more than a third of all American Indian students in sixth through 12th grades were suspended at least once during the 2015-16 school year, making them more than twice as likely to be suspended from school as their white peers. Native Americans make up one-third of the district's student population but receive nearly two-thirds of the expulsions.

Across the country, American Indian and Alaska Native students are disciplined more than most other racial groups, and they have a dropout rate twice the national average, resulting in what academic experts call a nationwide \"crisis\" for Native students. Many tribal leaders and education experts say these dismal statistics reflect, at worst, overt discrimination-and, at best, the alienation that Native students feel in a school system that has few Native teachers overall as well as limited lessons on Native American history and culture. For decades, the US Congress has allocated money to enhance the learning opportunities for Native students, who are among the poorest in the nation. But that amount is steadily declining on a per-pupil basis, and there is little oversight of how the money is actually used. 5 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer Want to Understand the New Cold War?

Books & the Arts / Brett Christophers This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal When the United States signed its treaties with the Indian tribes, stripping them of their land, it promised to provide public services-including education-to tribal members in perpetuity. \"For too long, the federal leadership has failed to honor that sacred pledge, leaving generations of Native children behind,\" said Washington State Senator John McCoy, a citizen of the Tulalip tribe and a national leader in Native education reform. \"Institutionalized assimilation and racism remain embedded within our public schools.\" 6 I n public schools across the country, American Indian and Alaska Native students are more likely to be suspended than any other racial group, with the exception of African Americans. According to a 2015 report by the University of California at Los Angeles's Center for Civil Rights Remedies, Native students are disciplined at roughly two times the rate of their white peers. And though they represent approximately 1 percent of the student population, they account for 2 percent of all school arrests and 3 percent of all incidents referred by school staff to law enforcement, according to 2014 data collected by the National Congress of American Indians. Native students also disproportionately attend virtual schools like Bridges, according to an analysis conducted for this article by UCLA. Recent studies show that most students who attend these schools learn less math or reading than their peers in traditional public schools. (More than 90 percent of American Indian students attend public schools, while a majority of the rest attend schools administered by the Bureau of Indian Education, where students have some of the lowest graduation rates and test scores nationwide.) 7 Current Issue View our current issue The high levels of poverty on Native American reservations do create barriers to educational success. But a number of studies have shown that, even when researchers control for poverty, race still determines whether students are more harshly disciplined in the public-school system-and students of all ethnicities who are suspended or expelled are more likely to leave school for good, a phenomenon that researchers refer to as being \"pushed out.\" 8 Frequent suspensions or expulsions can also lead to gaps in learning, a cycle reflected in the poor math and reading scores of Native students on a national level. Native students are less likely to graduate in four years than any other racial group; by the time they reach their senior year, only 10 percent are proficient in math, according to the results compiled for the year 2015 by the National Assessment of Educational Progress. (Less than 5 percent of Native 11th graders in Oregon's 509J School District met math-proficiency levels in 2016.) 9 Harsh discipline and low graduation rates can limit the economic and social opportunities for students beyond their teenage years. Low graduation rates contribute to high unemployment on reservations, as well as diminished levels of home ownership. Though Native Americans are regularly omitted from national studies, in large part due to their small population size, studies of other minority groups have found that being expelled or dropping out of school is also associated with higher incarceration rates. Plus the suicide rate among Native teens is one and a half times higher than the national average, according to the Centers for Disease Control; it's likely that negative experiences in school, including expulsion or suspension, are associated with this epidemic, said Dr. R. Dale Walker, the director of Oregon Health and Science University's Center for American Indian Health Education and Research. 10 Last year, less than two-thirds of the tribal members enrolled in the 509J School District graduated. \"Why the heck aren't we doing better, and why has it taken so long? I just go, 'Ugh!'\" said Rick Molitor, the superintendent of the 509J School District for the past nine years. (He retired on July 1.) Molitor adds that the high disciplinary rates stem, in large part, from a lack of cultural understanding among teachers. In the past two years, he's been working with the Warm Springs tribe to increase cultural programming in the schools, and he credits new facilities and programs like Bridges with helping to increase the graduation rate. Even so, \"we have a long ways to go,\" he acknowledged. \"I've been going out to Warm Springs and saying, 'We're failing our Native American kids.' There's no way we can come forward and say we're being successful.\" 11 I n late June, the ACLU of Montana supported a formal complaint with both the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice alleging that a school district in rural Montana discriminates against students who are citizens of the Assiniboine and Sioux nations. \"Native students have been systematically disadvantaged in comparison to their non-Native peers through racially biased enforcement of school discipline policies, inequitable access to school activities, and verbal abuse by teachers and staff,\" attorney Melina Healey asserted in a statement announcing the complaint. (Schools receiving public money are required to abide by federal anti-discrimination laws, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.) 12 The Montana complaint also alleges that the district mismanages the Native-specific federal funding that is allocated by Congress to support Native students and fulfill treaty obligations. Many tribes describe this money as critical for their students. Without it, kids in places like Putnam City, Oklahoma, might go without backpacks, calculators, or caps and gowns at graduation. Districts in other states use the funds to support students by sponsoring Native American clubs, powwows, and Native music or language classes. 13 Despite their importance, these federal funding programs are loosely managed. The Johnson O'Malley program, created in 1934 to fund basic educational needs of Native students, disperses money based on the number of enrolled tribal members attending public school. Congress hasn't completed the necessary population survey since 1994, while the number of Native students has grown by approximately 4 percent per year-meaning that the same pool of money authorized in 1994 must now cover far more children. In 1995, the federal government allocated $125 per student; last year, the allotment was just $63.80. President Trump's proposed budget would cut program spending even further, by 30 percent. Over a year ago, Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota introduced a bill that would update the survey; it hasn't gotten out of committee. 14 The other major source of federal money specifically earmarked for Native students are Title VI grants, which school districts use to enhance the educational experience of Native kids through things like music or language classes. The US Department of Education conducts only cursory audits of the program, and it fails to ensure that the money is targeted specifically to Native students, rather than the student body at large. 15 Tribal members in other areas share the Assiniboine and Sioux nations' concern about mismanagement of this funding, which amounts to more than $100 million each year nationally. Attempts to learn how Oregon's 509J School District and others use the funds revealed a lack of transparency and oversight. \"Many tribes are regularly concerned about how exactly districts are spending the money intended to help our children,\" said Quinton Roman Nose, executive director of the Tribal Education Departments National Assembly, via e-mail. \"Often when we ask for specific details on where the money goes, we get a broad budget that doesn't provide answers to questions being asked by tribes and parents. Ultimately, there's the golden rule: He who has the gold rules. And the schools are the grantees; they've got the money, and they can do with it whatever they want.\" 16 T he roots of the current crisis in American Indian education were planted 138 years ago, when the great-great-great-grandparents of today's students were children. Seen as an enlightened alternative to genocide, the federal government and a network of churches created hundreds of Indian boarding schools intended to assimilate Native Americans and eradicate their culture. If Native parents didn't send their children away to these schools, agents of the Department of the Interior were authorized to arrest them or withhold food (provided in exchange for land), which for most families meant starvation. 17 I felt worthless-like I wasn't worth the effort or patience to understand who I am or my history.\" -Warm Springs Councilwoman Carina Miller \"Education affords the true solution to the Indian problem...only by complete isolation of the Indian child from his savage antecedents can he be satisfactorily educated,\" Indian School Superintendent John B. Riley declared in 1886. In these boarding schools, which persisted into the 1970s, Native children weren't allowed to speak their own language, practice their culture, or see their family on a regular basis. Some students were physically or sexually abused by their teachers or dormitory supervisors. Many returned to their families and tribal communities deeply scarred. Dr. Susan Faircloth, a professor of education at the University of North Carolina, Wil- mington, and a member of the Coharie tribe, pointed out that this history \"make[s] it difficult, if not impossible, for many American Indian families and their children to fully engage with schools and educators.\" 18 Today, there are no Native classroom teachers or administrators at Madras High School, the large public school serving the Warm Springs reservation. \"The reason why behaviors are so bad here in this district is that teachers aren't culturally aware,\" said Ellise David, a senior at the school, which has a student body that is one-third Native American, one-third Hispanic, and one-third white. David, a member of the school board and the Indian Education Committee for the tribe, added that many teachers don't understand the challenges that Native students and their families face-for example, getting to a teacher conference on time if they don't have a car. \"I hate teachers who are more like, 'I'm only here to teach-I'm not here to know your family,'\" David said. \"Being aware of what the students go through-not just Native students, but Hispanics too-will help the teachers manage their classrooms.\" 19 Most of the parents, teachers, and students in Warm Springs whom I interviewed for this story were afraid that if they were quoted, the district would somehow punish them. One teacher that I interviewed on background was placed on administrative leave, ostensibly out of concern that she had shared confidential information about students during our conversation, according to an investigator that the district hired, who contacted me. (She hadn't.) 20 Again, the lack of Native teachers and administrators isn't unique to Madras. Less than 1 percent of educators nationwide are American Indian or Alaska Native. This is a real problem, because having teachers of one's own race can be a key to educational success: A recent study of 100,000 black students found that if they had at least one African-American teacher between third and fifth grade, their chances of dropping out declined by 29 percent. Though the Office of Indian Education has a grant program intended to create more Native teachers and administrators, the program is mismanaged, according to a 2010 audit by the Department of Education inspector general's office-leading to waste, fraud, and abuse, as well as a failure to fund projects that conduct significant training. (The OIE declined to answer whether it had made any reforms since the audit.) 21 This dearth of Native teachers is mirrored by the lack of lessons about Native Americans taught to public-school students across the country. Eighty-seven percent of the references to American Indians in the various state academic standards, upon which textbooks are based, concern events that happened before 1900, according to one 2015 study; only Arizona, Washington, Oklahoma, and Kansas teach about the boarding schools. Though the situation is better than it was 50 years ago, Native American content in school textbooks still perpetuates cultural stereotypes, while few textbooks convey the tribal perspectives on historical events and cultural concerns, according to a 2012 survey. (For example, some Nebraska textbooks have described American Indians as lazy and drunk.) 22 \"For more than a century, we've made Natives understand the non-Native culture and adjust accordingly, and it does not work. It's not reciprocal-it's assimilation,\" said Ahniwake Rose, executive director of the National Indian Education Association. \"Native students are often only shown small and very specific reflections of themselves in school-usually lesson plans around the 'Thanksgiving story,' or 'Indian pride' in the context of a school mascot. These reflections are so wrong, so totally off base, that our students disengage from learning.\" 23 For both Native and non-Native teachers who want to help their Native students thrive, there is a paucity of available research to guide their efforts. Because of their relatively small numbers in the overall population, Native students often don't get studied. Indian educational leaders refer to themselves as the \"Asterisk Nation\": \"an asterisk, instead of [a] data point, is often used in data displays,\" reports the National Congress of American Indians. 24 Without reliable data and research, government agencies at every level don't know how to fix problems or allocate funds. This lack of understanding filters down to the classrooms of local schools, where teachers and administrators are often ignorant about their Native students. For example, Warm Springs and other tribes hold funeral ceremonies that last for several weeks; some school districts expel students who miss so many classes. According to a 2013 Office for Civil Rights complaint made by California's Wiyot tribe against the local school district for a range of mistreatment, teachers regularly touched their Native students' long hair, which is culturally offensive. 25 Native students are disciplined at roughly two times the rate of their white peers. L ast winter, I watched Laura Lynn, an educational trainer and professor at the University of Washington's new Native Education Certificate program, teach a fifth-grade lesson on colonization. She studied a crayon drawing made by a student who'd been asked to depict a place that was sacred to her. \"I like this part of the beach you made,\" Lynn said, ripping off a corner of the paper. The class grew silent. She continued to tear the paper. \"I think I'll keep it.\" 26 Lynn's students were actually middle- and high-school teachers attending a series of statewide training sessions mandated by a state law-long on the books but only fully funded last year-that requires school districts to teach the history, government, and culture of their local tribes, using curriculums created and vetted by tribal people. \"To come out of high school and not learn about the colonization of Native people is not right.\" 27 Research shows that Native kids are more likely to thrive, to stay out of trouble and stay in school, when they learn about their culture and language. To that end, a small but growing number of states like Washington now encourage or require that Indian Education be taught to all students, at all levels of schooling. To expand such teaching nationwide, this past spring the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian launched Native Knowledge 360, a free online resource of interactive lessons and educational resources that teachers of all grades and subject areas can use. 28 Related Article A Right-Wing Think Tank Is Trying to Bring Down the Indian Child Welfare Act. Why? Rebecca Clarren Kids also need champions and advocates, said Sheldon Spotted Elk, director of Indian Child Welfare at Casey Family Programs. He pointed to the work of Eileen Quintana, a celebrated Title VI administrator in Utah who, through her Ute dancing classes and dedication to students, is credited with raising American Indian graduation rates in her district from 37 percent when she started 20 years ago to 100 percent last year. A bill introduced earlier this year in the US Senate aims to develop more such teachers: It creates incentives, such as loan forgiveness and scholarships, for teachers who work in schools with a large population of Native students. 29 In 2016, the Obama administration signed a law that for the first time requires school districts to engage in \"timely and meaningful consultation [with tribes] on issues affecting American Indian and Alaska Native students\" or risk losing federal aid. Such partnerships may help to keep Native kids in school and supported. For example, the Chickasaw Nation, based in Oklahoma, now receives notification from the school district when students are truant, triggering a tribally led process to contact families and provide wraparound services for the students to keep them in school. 30 So far, the Trump administration hasn't shown interest in improving the circumstances for Native students. Instead, the budget proposed by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos would eliminate more than $4 billion from the programs that support Native kids. DeVos advocates a voucher system, which would provide students with public money to attend private schools. But to use these vouchers, most tribal students would have to travel more than 70 miles round-trip to get to and from school. DeVos also promotes virtual schools like the trailer in Warm Springs, where students learn primarily from computer programs. 31 B ack on the Warm Springs reservation, the incoming superintendent of the 509J School District, Ken Parshall, told me that he is \"passionate about making brighter outcomes for my students.\" A pilot program launched this past year helps the current support staff earn a teaching license; one Native teacher from that program is now applying for a job with the district. 32 Failure doesn't have to be a destiny for Native American students. Savannah Holliday, the student who was expelled in every year of middle school, went on to receive a full scholarship to Southern Oregon University, where she plans to study forensic pathology. She credited her success to her mother and her participation in a traditional-dancing group. 33 When we met, Holliday was wearing her traditional dress, bedecked with purple and blue beads and shells. \"In order to be successful, you need to know who you are,\" she said. \"The dances help me identify who I am and where I come from. Everything at Madras High School is not of my culture, but at dance practice I fit in, and I feel less alone.\" 34\n\nSavannah Holliday, a poised 18-year-old who lives on the Warm Springs reservation, was expelled in each year of middle school, once after fighting with another student who, Holliday said, called her a racial slur. After she was kicked out, Holliday's only option was to attend virtual classes like those offered in the trailer at Warm Springs. The computer-taught lessons weren't very engaging, Holliday said, and she still doesn't understand many basic math concepts. \"I missed out on a lot of learning opportunities. You were kind of on your own-they'd have people watching you, but sometimes, if we asked for help, they couldn't help.\" Many of her classmates who were suspended or expelled eventually dropped out of school altogether. When I asked Holliday if she could introduce me to some of them, she texted back: \"Most of them are pregnant, parents, addicted to drugs, moved away or dead...so would be hard for me to contact them.\" 3 Last year, less than two-thirds of the tribal members who were enrolled as seniors in the 509J School District graduated. Warm Springs Tribal Councilwoman Carina Miller, who graduated from the district in 2005, is concerned that Native students aren't receiving an equal education. The administrators \"don't see us as people deserving the same sort of education and opportunities,\" she said. Miller was suspended several times herself, once for swearing; a white student once called her a \"prairie nigger.\" As a student, she added, \"I felt worthless-like I wasn't worth the effort or patience to understand who I am and my history. This school district has failed us my entire lifetime, and it continues to do this today.\" 4 Warm Springs is not an outlier in this.

L ast winter, I watched Laura Lynn, an educational trainer and professor at the University of Washington's new Native Education Certificate program, teach a fifth-grade lesson on colonization. She studied a crayon drawing made by a student who'd been asked to depict a place that was sacred to her. \"I like this part of the beach you made,\" Lynn said, ripping off a corner of the paper. The class grew silent. She continued to tear the paper. \"I think I'll keep it.\" 26 Lynn's students were actually middle- and high-school teachers attending a series of statewide training sessions mandated by a state law-long on the books but only fully funded last year-that requires school districts to teach the history, government, and culture of their local tribes, using curriculums created and vetted by tribal people. \"To come out of high school and not learn about the colonization of Native people is not right.\" 27 Research shows that Native kids are more likely to thrive, to stay out of trouble and stay in school, when they learn about their culture and language. To that end, a small but growing number of states like Washington now encourage or require that Indian Education be taught to all students, at all levels of schooling. To expand such teaching nationwide, this past spring the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian launched Native Knowledge 360, a free online resource of interactive lessons and educational resources that teachers of all grades and subject areas can use. 28 Related Article A Right-Wing Think Tank Is Trying to Bring Down the Indian Child Welfare Act. Why? Rebecca Clarren Kids also need champions and advocates, said Sheldon Spotted Elk, director of Indian Child Welfare at Casey Family Programs. He pointed to the work of Eileen Quintana, a celebrated Title VI administrator in Utah who, through her Ute dancing classes and dedication to students, is credited with raising American Indian graduation rates in her district from 37 percent when she started 20 years ago to 100 percent last year. A bill introduced earlier this year in the US Senate aims to develop more such teachers: It creates incentives, such as loan forgiveness and scholarships, for teachers who work in schools with a large population of Native students. 29 In 2016, the Obama administration signed a law that for the first time requires school districts to engage in \"timely and meaningful consultation [with tribes] on issues affecting American Indian and Alaska Native students\" or risk losing federal aid. Such partnerships may help to keep Native kids in school and supported. For example, the Chickasaw Nation, based in Oklahoma, now receives notification from the school district when students are truant, triggering a tribally led process to contact families and provide wraparound services for the students to keep them in school. 30 So far, the Trump administration hasn't shown interest in improving the circumstances for Native students. Instead, the budget proposed by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos would eliminate more than $4 billion from the programs that support Native kids. DeVos advocates a voucher system, which would provide students with public money to attend private schools. But to use these vouchers, most tribal students would have to travel more than 70 miles round-trip to get to and from school. DeVos also promotes virtual schools like the trailer in Warm Springs, where students learn primarily from computer programs. 31 B ack on the Warm Springs reservation, the incoming superintendent of the 509J School District, Ken Parshall, told me that he is \"passionate about making brighter outcomes for my students.\" A pilot program launched this past year helps the current support staff earn a teaching license; one Native teacher from that program is now applying for a job with the district. 32 Failure doesn't have to be a destiny for Native American students. Savannah Holliday, the student who was expelled in every year of middle school, went on to receive a full scholarship to Southern Oregon University, where she plans to study forensic pathology. She credited her success to her mother and her participation in a traditional-dancing group. 33 When we met, Holliday was wearing her traditional dress, bedecked with purple and blue beads and shells. \"In order to be successful, you need to know who you are,\" she said. \"The dances help me identify who I am and where I come from. Everything at Madras High School is not of my culture, but at dance practice I fit in, and I feel less alone.\" 34\n\nLast year, less than two-thirds of the tribal members who were enrolled as seniors in the 509J School District graduated. Warm Springs Tribal Councilwoman Carina Miller, who graduated from the district in 2005, is concerned that Native students aren't receiving an equal education. The administrators \"don't see us as people deserving the same sort of education and opportunities,\" she said. Miller was suspended several times herself, once for swearing; a white student once called her a \"prairie nigger.\" As a student, she added, \"I felt worthless-like I wasn't worth the effort or patience to understand who I am and my history. This school district has failed us my entire lifetime, and it continues to do this today.\" 4 Warm Springs is not an outlier in this. Across the country, American Indian and Alaska Native students are disciplined more than most other racial groups, and they have a dropout rate twice the national average, resulting in what academic experts call a nationwide \"crisis\" for Native students. Many tribal leaders and education experts say these dismal statistics reflect, at worst, overt discrimination-and, at best, the alienation that Native students feel in a school system that has few Native teachers overall as well as limited lessons on Native American history and culture. For decades, the US Congress has allocated money to enhance the learning opportunities for Native students, who are among the poorest in the nation. But that amount is steadily declining on a per-pupil basis, and there is little oversight of how the money is actually used. 5 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer Want to Understand the New Cold War?

According to a 2015 report by the University of California at Los Angeles's Center for Civil Rights Remedies, Native students are disciplined at roughly two times the rate of their white peers. And though they represent approximately 1 percent of the student population, they account for 2 percent of all school arrests and 3 percent of all incidents referred by school staff to law enforcement, according to 2014 data collected by the National Congress of American Indians. Native students also disproportionately attend virtual schools like Bridges, according to an analysis conducted for this article by UCLA. Recent studies show that most students who attend these schools learn less math or reading than their peers in traditional public schools. (More than 90 percent of American Indian students attend public schools, while a majority of the rest attend schools administered by the Bureau of Indian Education, where students have some of the lowest graduation rates and test scores nationwide.) 7 Current Issue View our current issue The high levels of poverty on Native American reservations do create barriers to educational success. But a number of studies have shown that, even when researchers control for poverty, race still determines whether students are more harshly disciplined in the public-school system-and students of all ethnicities who are suspended or expelled are more likely to leave school for good, a phenomenon that researchers refer to as being \"pushed out.\" 8 Frequent suspensions or expulsions can also lead to gaps in learning, a cycle reflected in the poor math and reading scores of Native students on a national level. Native students are less likely to graduate in four years than any other racial group; by the time they reach their senior year, only 10 percent are proficient in math, according to the results compiled for the year 2015 by the National Assessment of Educational Progress. (Less than 5 percent of Native 11th graders in Oregon's 509J School District met math-proficiency levels in 2016.) 9 Harsh discipline and low graduation rates can limit the economic and social opportunities for students beyond their teenage years. Low graduation rates contribute to high unemployment on reservations, as well as diminished levels of home ownership. Though Native Americans are regularly omitted from national studies, in large part due to their small population size, studies of other minority groups have found that being expelled or dropping out of school is also associated with higher incarceration rates. Plus the suicide rate among Native teens is one and a half times higher than the national average, according to the Centers for Disease Control; it's likely that negative experiences in school, including expulsion or suspension, are associated with this epidemic, said Dr. R. Dale Walker, the director of Oregon Health and Science University's Center for American Indian Health Education and Research. 10 Last year, less than two-thirds of the tribal members enrolled in the 509J School District graduated. \"Why the heck aren't we doing better, and why has it taken so long? I just go, 'Ugh!'\" said Rick Molitor, the superintendent of the 509J School District for the past nine years. (He retired on July 1.) Molitor adds that the high disciplinary rates stem, in large part, from a lack of cultural understanding among teachers. In the past two years, he's been working with the Warm Springs tribe to increase cultural programming in the schools, and he credits new facilities and programs like Bridges with helping to increase the graduation rate. Even so, \"we have a long ways to go,\" he acknowledged. \"I've been going out to Warm Springs and saying, 'We're failing our Native American kids.' There's no way we can come forward and say we're being successful.\" 11 I n late June, the ACLU of Montana supported a formal complaint with both the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice alleging that a school district in rural Montana discriminates against students who are citizens of the Assiniboine and Sioux nations. \"Native students have been systematically disadvantaged in comparison to their non-Native peers through racially biased enforcement of school discipline policies, inequitable access to school activities, and verbal abuse by teachers and staff,\" attorney Melina Healey asserted in a statement announcing the complaint. (Schools receiving public money are required to abide by federal anti-discrimination laws, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.) 12 The Montana complaint also alleges that the district mismanages the Native-specific federal funding that is allocated by Congress to support Native students and fulfill treaty obligations. Many tribes describe this money as critical for their students. Without it, kids in places like Putnam City, Oklahoma, might go without backpacks, calculators, or caps and gowns at graduation. Districts in other states use the funds to support students by sponsoring Native American clubs, powwows, and Native music or language classes. 13 Despite their importance, these federal funding programs are loosely managed. The Johnson O'Malley program, created in 1934 to fund basic educational needs of Native students, disperses money based on the number of enrolled tribal members attending public school. Congress hasn't completed the necessary population survey since 1994, while the number of Native students has grown by approximately 4 percent per year-meaning that the same pool of money authorized in 1994 must now cover far more children. In 1995, the federal government allocated $125 per student; last year, the allotment was just $63.80. President Trump's proposed budget would cut program spending even further, by 30 percent. Over a year ago, Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota introduced a bill that would update the survey; it hasn't gotten out of committee. 14 The other major source of federal money specifically earmarked for Native students are Title VI grants, which school districts use to enhance the educational experience of Native kids through things like music or language classes. The US Department of Education conducts only cursory audits of the program, and it fails to ensure that the money is targeted specifically to Native students, rather than the student body at large. 15 Tribal members in other areas share the Assiniboine and Sioux nations' concern about mismanagement of this funding, which amounts to more than $100 million each year nationally. Attempts to learn how Oregon's 509J School District and others use the funds revealed a lack of transparency and oversight. \"Many tribes are regularly concerned about how exactly districts are spending the money intended to help our children,\" said Quinton Roman Nose, executive director of the Tribal Education Departments National Assembly, via e-mail. \"Often when we ask for specific details on where the money goes, we get a broad budget that doesn't provide answers to questions being asked by tribes and parents. Ultimately, there's the golden rule: He who has the gold rules. And the schools are the grantees; they've got the money, and they can do with it whatever they want.\" 16 T he roots of the current crisis in American Indian education were planted 138 years ago, when the great-great-great-grandparents of today's students were children. Seen as an enlightened alternative to genocide, the federal government and a network of churches created hundreds of Indian boarding schools intended to assimilate Native Americans and eradicate their culture. If Native parents didn't send their children away to these schools, agents of the Department of the Interior were authorized to arrest them or withhold food (provided in exchange for land), which for most families meant starvation. 17 I felt worthless-like I wasn't worth the effort or patience to understand who I am or my history.\" -Warm Springs Councilwoman Carina Miller \"Education affords the true solution to the Indian problem...only by complete isolation of the Indian child from his savage antecedents can he be satisfactorily educated,\" Indian School Superintendent John B. Riley declared in 1886. In these boarding schools, which persisted into the 1970s, Native children weren't allowed to speak their own language, practice their culture, or see their family on a regular basis. Some students were physically or sexually abused by their teachers or dormitory supervisors. Many returned to their families and tribal communities deeply scarred. Dr. Susan Faircloth, a professor of education at the University of North Carolina, Wil- mington, and a member of the Coharie tribe, pointed out that this history \"make[s] it difficult, if not impossible, for many American Indian families and their children to fully engage with schools and educators.\" 18 Today, there are no Native classroom teachers or administrators at Madras High School, the large public school serving the Warm Springs reservation. \"The reason why behaviors are so bad here in this district is that teachers aren't culturally aware,\" said Ellise David, a senior at the school, which has a student body that is one-third Native American, one-third Hispanic, and one-third white. David, a member of the school board and the Indian Education Committee for the tribe, added that many teachers don't understand the challenges that Native students and their families face-for example, getting to a teacher conference on time if they don't have a car. \"I hate teachers who are more like, 'I'm only here to teach-I'm not here to know your family,'\" David said. \"Being aware of what the students go through-not just Native students, but Hispanics too-will help the teachers manage their classrooms.\" 19 Most of the parents, teachers, and students in Warm Springs whom I interviewed for this story were afraid that if they were quoted, the district would somehow punish them. One teacher that I interviewed on background was placed on administrative leave, ostensibly out of concern that she had shared confidential information about students during our conversation, according to an investigator that the district hired, who contacted me. (She hadn't.) 20 Again, the lack of Native teachers and administrators isn't unique to Madras. Less than 1 percent of educators nationwide are American Indian or Alaska Native. This is a real problem, because having teachers of one's own race can be a key to educational success: A recent study of 100,000 black students found that if they had at least one African-American teacher between third and fifth grade, their chances of dropping out declined by 29 percent. Though the Office of Indian Education has a grant program intended to create more Native teachers and administrators, the program is mismanaged, according to a 2010 audit by the Department of Education inspector general's office-leading to waste, fraud, and abuse, as well as a failure to fund projects that conduct significant training. (The OIE declined to answer whether it had made any reforms since the audit.) 21 This dearth of Native teachers is mirrored by the lack of lessons about Native Americans taught to public-school students across the country. Eighty-seven percent of the references to American Indians in the various state academic standards, upon which textbooks are based, concern events that happened before 1900, according to one 2015 study; only Arizona, Washington, Oklahoma, and Kansas teach about the boarding schools. Though the situation is better than it was 50 years ago, Native American content in school textbooks still perpetuates cultural stereotypes, while few textbooks convey the tribal perspectives on historical events and cultural concerns, according to a 2012 survey. (For example, some Nebraska textbooks have described American Indians as lazy and drunk.) 22 \"For more than a century, we've made Natives understand the non-Native culture and adjust accordingly, and it does not work. It's not reciprocal-it's assimilation,\" said Ahniwake Rose, executive director of the National Indian Education Association. \"Native students are often only shown small and very specific reflections of themselves in school-usually lesson plans around the 'Thanksgiving story,' or 'Indian pride' in the context of a school mascot. These reflections are so wrong, so totally off base, that our students disengage from learning.\" 23 For both Native and non-Native teachers who want to help their Native students thrive, there is a paucity of available research to guide their efforts. Because of their relatively small numbers in the overall population, Native students often don't get studied. Indian educational leaders refer to themselves as the \"Asterisk Nation\": \"an asterisk, instead of [a] data point, is often used in data displays,\" reports the National Congress of American Indians. 24 Without reliable data and research, government agencies at every level don't know how to fix problems or allocate funds. This lack of understanding filters down to the classrooms of local schools, where teachers and administrators are often ignorant about their Native students. For example, Warm Springs and other tribes hold funeral ceremonies that last for several weeks; some school districts expel students who miss so many classes. According to a 2013 Office for Civil Rights complaint made by California's Wiyot tribe against the local school district for a range of mistreatment, teachers regularly touched their Native students' long hair, which is culturally offensive. 25 Native students are disciplined at roughly two times the rate of their white peers.

David, a member of the school board and the Indian Education Committee for the tribe, added that many teachers don't understand the challenges that Native students and their families face-for example, getting to a teacher conference on time if they don't have a car. \"I hate teachers who are more like, 'I'm only here to teach-I'm not here to know your family,'\" David said. \"Being aware of what the students go through-not just Native students, but Hispanics too-will help the teachers manage their classrooms.\" 19 Most of the parents, teachers, and students in Warm Springs whom I interviewed for this story were afraid that if they were quoted, the district would somehow punish them. One teacher that I interviewed on background was placed on administrative leave, ostensibly out of concern that she had shared confidential information about students during our conversation, according to an investigator that the district hired, who contacted me. (She hadn't.) 20 Again, the lack of Native teachers and administrators isn't unique to Madras. Less than 1 percent of educators nationwide are American Indian or Alaska Native. This is a real problem, because having teachers of one's own race can be a key to educational success: A recent study of 100,000 black students found that if they had at least one African-American teacher between third and fifth grade, their chances of dropping out declined by 29 percent. Though the Office of Indian Education has a grant program intended to create more Native teachers and administrators, the program is mismanaged, according to a 2010 audit by the Department of Education inspector general's office-leading to waste, fraud, and abuse, as well as a failure to fund projects that conduct significant training. (The OIE declined to answer whether it had made any reforms since the audit.) 21 This dearth of Native teachers is mirrored by the lack of lessons about Native Americans taught to public-school students across the country. Eighty-seven percent of the references to American Indians in the various state academic standards, upon which textbooks are based, concern events that happened before 1900, according to one 2015 study; only Arizona, Washington, Oklahoma, and Kansas teach about the boarding schools. Though the situation is better than it was 50 years ago, Native American content in school textbooks still perpetuates cultural stereotypes, while few textbooks convey the tribal perspectives on historical events and cultural concerns, according to a 2012 survey. (For example, some Nebraska textbooks have described American Indians as lazy and drunk.) 22 \"For more than a century, we've made Natives understand the non-Native culture and adjust accordingly, and it does not work. It's not reciprocal-it's assimilation,\" said Ahniwake Rose, executive director of the National Indian Education Association. \"Native students are often only shown small and very specific reflections of themselves in school-usually lesson plans around the 'Thanksgiving story,' or 'Indian pride' in the context of a school mascot. These reflections are so wrong, so totally off base, that our students disengage from learning.\" 23 For both Native and non-Native teachers who want to help their Native students thrive, there is a paucity of available research to guide their efforts. Because of their relatively small numbers in the overall population, Native students often don't get studied. Indian educational leaders refer to themselves as the \"Asterisk Nation\": \"an asterisk, instead of [a] data point, is often used in data displays,\" reports the National Congress of American Indians. 24 Without reliable data and research, government agencies at every level don't know how to fix problems or allocate funds. This lack of understanding filters down to the classrooms of local schools, where teachers and administrators are often ignorant about their Native students. For example, Warm Springs and other tribes hold funeral ceremonies that last for several weeks; some school districts expel students who miss so many classes. According to a 2013 Office for Civil Rights complaint made by California's Wiyot tribe against the local school district for a range of mistreatment, teachers regularly touched their Native students' long hair, which is culturally offensive. 25 Native students are disciplined at roughly two times the rate of their white peers. L ast winter, I watched Laura Lynn, an educational trainer and professor at the University of Washington's new Native Education Certificate program, teach a fifth-grade lesson on colonization. She studied a crayon drawing made by a student who'd been asked to depict a place that was sacred to her. \"I like this part of the beach you made,\" Lynn said, ripping off a corner of the paper. The class grew silent. She continued to tear the paper. \"I think I'll keep it.\" 26 Lynn's students were actually middle- and high-school teachers attending a series of statewide training sessions mandated by a state law-long on the books but only fully funded last year-that requires school districts to teach the history, government, and culture of their local tribes, using curriculums created and vetted by tribal people. \"To come out of high school and not learn about the colonization of Native people is not right.\" 27 Research shows that Native kids are more likely to thrive, to stay out of trouble and stay in school, when they learn about their culture and language. To that end, a small but growing number of states like Washington now encourage or require that Indian Education be taught to all students, at all levels of schooling. To expand such teaching nationwide, this past spring the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian launched Native Knowledge 360, a free online resource of interactive lessons and educational resources that teachers of all grades and subject areas can use. 28 Related Article A Right-Wing Think Tank Is Trying to Bring Down the Indian Child Welfare Act. Why? Rebecca Clarren Kids also need champions and advocates, said Sheldon Spotted Elk, director of Indian Child Welfare at Casey Family Programs. He pointed to the work of Eileen Quintana, a celebrated Title VI administrator in Utah who, through her Ute dancing classes and dedication to students, is credited with raising American Indian graduation rates in her district from 37 percent when she started 20 years ago to 100 percent last year. A bill introduced earlier this year in the US Senate aims to develop more such teachers: It creates incentives, such as loan forgiveness and scholarships, for teachers who work in schools with a large population of Native students. 29 In 2016, the Obama administration signed a law that for the first time requires school districts to engage in \"timely and meaningful consultation [with tribes] on issues affecting American Indian and Alaska Native students\" or risk losing federal aid. Such partnerships may help to keep Native kids in school and supported. For example, the Chickasaw Nation, based in Oklahoma, now receives notification from the school district when students are truant, triggering a tribally led process to contact families and provide wraparound services for the students to keep them in school. 30 So far, the Trump administration hasn't shown interest in improving the circumstances for Native students. Instead, the budget proposed by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos would eliminate more than $4 billion from the programs that support Native kids. DeVos advocates a voucher system, which would provide students with public money to attend private schools. But to use these vouchers, most tribal students would have to travel more than 70 miles round-trip to get to and from school. DeVos also promotes virtual schools like the trailer in Warm Springs, where students learn primarily from computer programs. 31 B ack on the Warm Springs reservation, the incoming superintendent of the 509J School District, Ken Parshall, told me that he is \"passionate about making brighter outcomes for my students.\" A pilot program launched this past year helps the current support staff earn a teaching license; one Native teacher from that program is now applying for a job with the district. 32 Failure doesn't have to be a destiny for Native American students. Savannah Holliday, the student who was expelled in every year of middle school, went on to receive a full scholarship to Southern Oregon University, where she plans to study forensic pathology. She credited her success to her mother and her participation in a traditional-dancing group. 33 When we met, Holliday was wearing her traditional dress, bedecked with purple and blue beads and shells. \"In order to be successful, you need to know who you are,\" she said. \"The dances help me identify who I am and where I come from. Everything at Madras High School is not of my culture, but at dance practice I fit in, and I feel less alone.\" 34\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nJeet Heer\n\nBooks & the Arts / Brett Christophers\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nJeet Heer\n\nBooks & the Arts / Brett Christophers\n\nElie Mystal\n\nWhen the United States signed its treaties with the Indian tribes, stripping them of their land, it promised to provide public services-including education-to tribal members in perpetuity. \"For too long, the federal leadership has failed to honor that sacred pledge, leaving generations of Native children behind,\" said Washington State Senator John McCoy, a citizen of the Tulalip tribe and a national leader in Native education reform. \"Institutionalized assimilation and racism remain embedded within our public schools.\" 6 I n public schools across the country, American Indian and Alaska Native students are more likely to be suspended than any other racial group, with the exception of African Americans. According to a 2015 report by the University of California at Los Angeles's Center for Civil Rights Remedies, Native students are disciplined at roughly two times the rate of their white peers. And though they represent approximately 1 percent of the student population, they account for 2 percent of all school arrests and 3 percent of all incidents referred by school staff to law enforcement, according to 2014 data collected by the National Congress of American Indians. Native students also disproportionately attend virtual schools like Bridges, according to an analysis conducted for this article by UCLA. Recent studies show that most students who attend these schools learn less math or reading than their peers in traditional public schools. (More than 90 percent of American Indian students attend public schools, while a majority of the rest attend schools administered by the Bureau of Indian Education, where students have some of the lowest graduation rates and test scores nationwide.) 7 Current Issue View our current issue The high levels of poverty on Native American reservations do create barriers to educational success. But a number of studies have shown that, even when researchers control for poverty, race still determines whether students are more harshly disciplined in the public-school system-and students of all ethnicities who are suspended or expelled are more likely to leave school for good, a phenomenon that researchers refer to as being \"pushed out.\" 8 Frequent suspensions or expulsions can also lead to gaps in learning, a cycle reflected in the poor math and reading scores of Native students on a national level. Native students are less likely to graduate in four years than any other racial group; by the time they reach their senior year, only 10 percent are proficient in math, according to the results compiled for the year 2015 by the National Assessment of Educational Progress. (Less than 5 percent of Native 11th graders in Oregon's 509J School District met math-proficiency levels in 2016.) 9 Harsh discipline and low graduation rates can limit the economic and social opportunities for students beyond their teenage years. Low graduation rates contribute to high unemployment on reservations, as well as diminished levels of home ownership. Though Native Americans are regularly omitted from national studies, in large part due to their small population size, studies of other minority groups have found that being expelled or dropping out of school is also associated with higher incarceration rates. Plus the suicide rate among Native teens is one and a half times higher than the national average, according to the Centers for Disease Control; it's likely that negative experiences in school, including expulsion or suspension, are associated with this epidemic, said Dr. R. Dale Walker, the director of Oregon Health and Science University's Center for American Indian Health Education and Research. 10 Last year, less than two-thirds of the tribal members enrolled in the 509J School District graduated. \"Why the heck aren't we doing better, and why has it taken so long? I just go, 'Ugh!'\" said Rick Molitor, the superintendent of the 509J School District for the past nine years. (He retired on July 1.) Molitor adds that the high disciplinary rates stem, in large part, from a lack of cultural understanding among teachers. In the past two years, he's been working with the Warm Springs tribe to increase cultural programming in the schools, and he credits new facilities and programs like Bridges with helping to increase the graduation rate. Even so, \"we have a long ways to go,\" he acknowledged. \"I've been going out to Warm Springs and saying, 'We're failing our Native American kids.' There's no way we can come forward and say we're being successful.\" 11 I n late June, the ACLU of Montana supported a formal complaint with both the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice alleging that a school district in rural Montana discriminates against students who are citizens of the Assiniboine and Sioux nations. \"Native students have been systematically disadvantaged in comparison to their non-Native peers through racially biased enforcement of school discipline policies, inequitable access to school activities, and verbal abuse by teachers and staff,\" attorney Melina Healey asserted in a statement announcing the complaint. (Schools receiving public money are required to abide by federal anti-discrimination laws, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.) 12 The Montana complaint also alleges that the district mismanages the Native-specific federal funding that is allocated by Congress to support Native students and fulfill treaty obligations. Many tribes describe this money as critical for their students. Without it, kids in places like Putnam City, Oklahoma, might go without backpacks, calculators, or caps and gowns at graduation. Districts in other states use the funds to support students by sponsoring Native American clubs, powwows, and Native music or language classes. 13 Despite their importance, these federal funding programs are loosely managed. The Johnson O'Malley program, created in 1934 to fund basic educational needs of Native students, disperses money based on the number of enrolled tribal members attending public school. Congress hasn't completed the necessary population survey since 1994, while the number of Native students has grown by approximately 4 percent per year-meaning that the same pool of money authorized in 1994 must now cover far more children. In 1995, the federal government allocated $125 per student; last year, the allotment was just $63.80. President Trump's proposed budget would cut program spending even further, by 30 percent. Over a year ago, Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota introduced a bill that would update the survey; it hasn't gotten out of committee. 14 The other major source of federal money specifically earmarked for Native students are Title VI grants, which school districts use to enhance the educational experience of Native kids through things like music or language classes. The US Department of Education conducts only cursory audits of the program, and it fails to ensure that the money is targeted specifically to Native students, rather than the student body at large. 15 Tribal members in other areas share the Assiniboine and Sioux nations' concern about mismanagement of this funding, which amounts to more than $100 million each year nationally. Attempts to learn how Oregon's 509J School District and others use the funds revealed a lack of transparency and oversight. \"Many tribes are regularly concerned about how exactly districts are spending the money intended to help our children,\" said Quinton Roman Nose, executive director of the Tribal Education Departments National Assembly, via e-mail. \"Often when we ask for specific details on where the money goes, we get a broad budget that doesn't provide answers to questions being asked by tribes and parents. Ultimately, there's the golden rule: He who has the gold rules. And the schools are the grantees; they've got the money, and they can do with it whatever they want.\" 16 T he roots of the current crisis in American Indian education were planted 138 years ago, when the great-great-great-grandparents of today's students were children. Seen as an enlightened alternative to genocide, the federal government and a network of churches created hundreds of Indian boarding schools intended to assimilate Native Americans and eradicate their culture. If Native parents didn't send their children away to these schools, agents of the Department of the Interior were authorized to arrest them or withhold food (provided in exchange for land), which for most families meant starvation. 17 I felt worthless-like I wasn't worth the effort or patience to understand who I am or my history.\" -Warm Springs Councilwoman Carina Miller \"Education affords the true solution to the Indian problem...only by complete isolation of the Indian child from his savage antecedents can he be satisfactorily educated,\" Indian School Superintendent John B.

One teacher that I interviewed on background was placed on administrative leave, ostensibly out of concern that she had shared confidential information about students during our conversation, according to an investigator that the district hired, who contacted me. (She hadn't.) 20 Again, the lack of Native teachers and administrators isn't unique to Madras. Less than 1 percent of educators nationwide are American Indian or Alaska Native. This is a real problem, because having teachers of one's own race can be a key to educational success: A recent study of 100,000 black students found that if they had at least one African-American teacher between third and fifth grade, their chances of dropping out declined by 29 percent. Though the Office of Indian Education has a grant program intended to create more Native teachers and administrators, the program is mismanaged, according to a 2010 audit by the Department of Education inspector general's office-leading to waste, fraud, and abuse, as well as a failure to fund projects that conduct significant training. (The OIE declined to answer whether it had made any reforms since the audit.) 21 This dearth of Native teachers is mirrored by the lack of lessons about Native Americans taught to public-school students across the country. Eighty-seven percent of the references to American Indians in the various state academic standards, upon which textbooks are based, concern events that happened before 1900, according to one 2015 study; only Arizona, Washington, Oklahoma, and Kansas teach about the boarding schools. Though the situation is better than it was 50 years ago, Native American content in school textbooks still perpetuates cultural stereotypes, while few textbooks convey the tribal perspectives on historical events and cultural concerns, according to a 2012 survey. (For example, some Nebraska textbooks have described American Indians as lazy and drunk.) 22 \"For more than a century, we've made Natives understand the non-Native culture and adjust accordingly, and it does not work. It's not reciprocal-it's assimilation,\" said Ahniwake Rose, executive director of the National Indian Education Association. \"Native students are often only shown small and very specific reflections of themselves in school-usually lesson plans around the 'Thanksgiving story,' or 'Indian pride' in the context of a school mascot. These reflections are so wrong, so totally off base, that our students disengage from learning.\" 23 For both Native and non-Native teachers who want to help their Native students thrive, there is a paucity of available research to guide their efforts. Because of their relatively small numbers in the overall population, Native students often don't get studied. Indian educational leaders refer to themselves as the \"Asterisk Nation\": \"an asterisk, instead of [a] data point, is often used in data displays,\" reports the National Congress of American Indians. 24 Without reliable data and research, government agencies at every level don't know how to fix problems or allocate funds. This lack of understanding filters down to the classrooms of local schools, where teachers and administrators are often ignorant about their Native students. For example, Warm Springs and other tribes hold funeral ceremonies that last for several weeks; some school districts expel students who miss so many classes. According to a 2013 Office for Civil Rights complaint made by California's Wiyot tribe against the local school district for a range of mistreatment, teachers regularly touched their Native students' long hair, which is culturally offensive. 25 Native students are disciplined at roughly two times the rate of their white peers. L ast winter, I watched Laura Lynn, an educational trainer and professor at the University of Washington's new Native Education Certificate program, teach a fifth-grade lesson on colonization. She studied a crayon drawing made by a student who'd been asked to depict a place that was sacred to her. \"I like this part of the beach you made,\" Lynn said, ripping off a corner of the paper. The class grew silent. She continued to tear the paper. \"I think I'll keep it.\" 26 Lynn's students were actually middle- and high-school teachers attending a series of statewide training sessions mandated by a state law-long on the books but only fully funded last year-that requires school districts to teach the history, government, and culture of their local tribes, using curriculums created and vetted by tribal people. \"To come out of high school and not learn about the colonization of Native people is not right.\" 27 Research shows that Native kids are more likely to thrive, to stay out of trouble and stay in school, when they learn about their culture and language. To that end, a small but growing number of states like Washington now encourage or require that Indian Education be taught to all students, at all levels of schooling. To expand such teaching nationwide, this past spring the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian launched Native Knowledge 360, a free online resource of interactive lessons and educational resources that teachers of all grades and subject areas can use. 28 Related Article A Right-Wing Think Tank Is Trying to Bring Down the Indian Child Welfare Act. Why? Rebecca Clarren Kids also need champions and advocates, said Sheldon Spotted Elk, director of Indian Child Welfare at Casey Family Programs. He pointed to the work of Eileen Quintana, a celebrated Title VI administrator in Utah who, through her Ute dancing classes and dedication to students, is credited with raising American Indian graduation rates in her district from 37 percent when she started 20 years ago to 100 percent last year. A bill introduced earlier this year in the US Senate aims to develop more such teachers: It creates incentives, such as loan forgiveness and scholarships, for teachers who work in schools with a large population of Native students. 29 In 2016, the Obama administration signed a law that for the first time requires school districts to engage in \"timely and meaningful consultation [with tribes] on issues affecting American Indian and Alaska Native students\" or risk losing federal aid. Such partnerships may help to keep Native kids in school and supported. For example, the Chickasaw Nation, based in Oklahoma, now receives notification from the school district when students are truant, triggering a tribally led process to contact families and provide wraparound services for the students to keep them in school. 30 So far, the Trump administration hasn't shown interest in improving the circumstances for Native students. Instead, the budget proposed by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos would eliminate more than $4 billion from the programs that support Native kids. DeVos advocates a voucher system, which would provide students with public money to attend private schools. But to use these vouchers, most tribal students would have to travel more than 70 miles round-trip to get to and from school. DeVos also promotes virtual schools like the trailer in Warm Springs, where students learn primarily from computer programs. 31 B ack on the Warm Springs reservation, the incoming superintendent of the 509J School District, Ken Parshall, told me that he is \"passionate about making brighter outcomes for my students.\" A pilot program launched this past year helps the current support staff earn a teaching license; one Native teacher from that program is now applying for a job with the district. 32 Failure doesn't have to be a destiny for Native American students. Savannah Holliday, the student who was expelled in every year of middle school, went on to receive a full scholarship to Southern Oregon University, where she plans to study forensic pathology. She credited her success to her mother and her participation in a traditional-dancing group. 33 When we met, Holliday was wearing her traditional dress, bedecked with purple and blue beads and shells. \"In order to be successful, you need to know who you are,\" she said. \"The dances help me identify who I am and where I come from. Everything at Madras High School is not of my culture, but at dance practice I fit in, and I feel less alone.\" 34\n\nThe high levels of poverty on Native American reservations do create barriers to educational success. But a number of studies have shown that, even when researchers control for poverty, race still determines whether students are more harshly disciplined in the public-school system-and students of all ethnicities who are suspended or expelled are more likely to leave school for good, a phenomenon that researchers refer to as being \"pushed out.\" 8 Frequent suspensions or expulsions can also lead to gaps in learning, a cycle reflected in the poor math and reading scores of Native students on a national level. Native students are less likely to graduate in four years than any other racial group; by the time they reach their senior year, only 10 percent are proficient in math, according to the results compiled for the year 2015 by the National Assessment of Educational Progress. (Less than 5 percent of Native 11th graders in Oregon's 509J School District met math-proficiency levels in 2016.) 9 Harsh discipline and low graduation rates can limit the economic and social opportunities for students beyond their teenage years. Low graduation rates contribute to high unemployment on reservations, as well as diminished levels of home ownership. Though Native Americans are regularly omitted from national studies, in large part due to their small population size, studies of other minority groups have found that being expelled or dropping out of school is also associated with higher incarceration rates. Plus the suicide rate among Native teens is one and a half times higher than the national average, according to the Centers for Disease Control; it's likely that negative experiences in school, including expulsion or suspension, are associated with this epidemic, said Dr. R. Dale Walker, the director of Oregon Health and Science University's Center for American Indian Health Education and Research. 10 Last year, less than two-thirds of the tribal members enrolled in the 509J School District graduated. \"Why the heck aren't we doing better, and why has it taken so long? I just go, 'Ugh!'\" said Rick Molitor, the superintendent of the 509J School District for the past nine years. (He retired on July 1.) Molitor adds that the high disciplinary rates stem, in large part, from a lack of cultural understanding among teachers. In the past two years, he's been working with the Warm Springs tribe to increase cultural programming in the schools, and he credits new facilities and programs like Bridges with helping to increase the graduation rate. Even so, \"we have a long ways to go,\" he acknowledged. \"I've been going out to Warm Springs and saying, 'We're failing our Native American kids.' There's no way we can come forward and say we're being successful.\" 11 I n late June, the ACLU of Montana supported a formal complaint with both the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice alleging that a school district in rural Montana discriminates against students who are citizens of the Assiniboine and Sioux nations. \"Native students have been systematically disadvantaged in comparison to their non-Native peers through racially biased enforcement of school discipline policies, inequitable access to school activities, and verbal abuse by teachers and staff,\" attorney Melina Healey asserted in a statement announcing the complaint. (Schools receiving public money are required to abide by federal anti-discrimination laws, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.) 12 The Montana complaint also alleges that the district mismanages the Native-specific federal funding that is allocated by Congress to support Native students and fulfill treaty obligations. Many tribes describe this money as critical for their students. Without it, kids in places like Putnam City, Oklahoma, might go without backpacks, calculators, or caps and gowns at graduation. Districts in other states use the funds to support students by sponsoring Native American clubs, powwows, and Native music or language classes. 13 Despite their importance, these federal funding programs are loosely managed. The Johnson O'Malley program, created in 1934 to fund basic educational needs of Native students, disperses money based on the number of enrolled tribal members attending public school. Congress hasn't completed the necessary population survey since 1994, while the number of Native students has grown by approximately 4 percent per year-meaning that the same pool of money authorized in 1994 must now cover far more children. In 1995, the federal government allocated $125 per student; last year, the allotment was just $63.80. President Trump's proposed budget would cut program spending even further, by 30 percent. Over a year ago, Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota introduced a bill that would update the survey; it hasn't gotten out of committee. 14 The other major source of federal money specifically earmarked for Native students are Title VI grants, which school districts use to enhance the educational experience of Native kids through things like music or language classes. The US Department of Education conducts only cursory audits of the program, and it fails to ensure that the money is targeted specifically to Native students, rather than the student body at large. 15 Tribal members in other areas share the Assiniboine and Sioux nations' concern about mismanagement of this funding, which amounts to more than $100 million each year nationally. Attempts to learn how Oregon's 509J School District and others use the funds revealed a lack of transparency and oversight. \"Many tribes are regularly concerned about how exactly districts are spending the money intended to help our children,\" said Quinton Roman Nose, executive director of the Tribal Education Departments National Assembly, via e-mail. \"Often when we ask for specific details on where the money goes, we get a broad budget that doesn't provide answers to questions being asked by tribes and parents. Ultimately, there's the golden rule: He who has the gold rules. And the schools are the grantees; they've got the money, and they can do with it whatever they want.\" 16 T he roots of the current crisis in American Indian education were planted 138 years ago, when the great-great-great-grandparents of today's students were children. Seen as an enlightened alternative to genocide, the federal government and a network of churches created hundreds of Indian boarding schools intended to assimilate Native Americans and eradicate their culture. If Native parents didn't send their children away to these schools, agents of the Department of the Interior were authorized to arrest them or withhold food (provided in exchange for land), which for most families meant starvation. 17 I felt worthless-like I wasn't worth the effort or patience to understand who I am or my history.\" -Warm Springs Councilwoman Carina Miller \"Education affords the true solution to the Indian problem...only by complete isolation of the Indian child from his savage antecedents can he be satisfactorily educated,\" Indian School Superintendent John B. Riley declared in 1886. In these boarding schools, which persisted into the 1970s, Native children weren't allowed to speak their own language, practice their culture, or see their family on a regular basis. Some students were physically or sexually abused by their teachers or dormitory supervisors. Many returned to their families and tribal communities deeply scarred. Dr. Susan Faircloth, a professor of education at the University of North Carolina, Wil- mington, and a member of the Coharie tribe, pointed out that this history \"make[s] it difficult, if not impossible, for many American Indian families and their children to fully engage with schools and educators.\" 18 Today, there are no Native classroom teachers or administrators at Madras High School, the large public school serving the Warm Springs reservation. \"The reason why behaviors are so bad here in this district is that teachers aren't culturally aware,\" said Ellise David, a senior at the school, which has a student body that is one-third Native American, one-third Hispanic, and one-third white.

According to a 2013 Office for Civil Rights complaint made by California's Wiyot tribe against the local school district for a range of mistreatment, teachers regularly touched their Native students' long hair, which is culturally offensive. 25 Native students are disciplined at roughly two times the rate of their white peers. L ast winter, I watched Laura Lynn, an educational trainer and professor at the University of Washington's new Native Education Certificate program, teach a fifth-grade lesson on colonization. She studied a crayon drawing made by a student who'd been asked to depict a place that was sacred to her. \"I like this part of the beach you made,\" Lynn said, ripping off a corner of the paper. The class grew silent. She continued to tear the paper. \"I think I'll keep it.\" 26 Lynn's students were actually middle- and high-school teachers attending a series of statewide training sessions mandated by a state law-long on the books but only fully funded last year-that requires school districts to teach the history, government, and culture of their local tribes, using curriculums created and vetted by tribal people. \"To come out of high school and not learn about the colonization of Native people is not right.\" 27 Research shows that Native kids are more likely to thrive, to stay out of trouble and stay in school, when they learn about their culture and language. To that end, a small but growing number of states like Washington now encourage or require that Indian Education be taught to all students, at all levels of schooling. To expand such teaching nationwide, this past spring the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian launched Native Knowledge 360, a free online resource of interactive lessons and educational resources that teachers of all grades and subject areas can use. 28 Related Article A Right-Wing Think Tank Is Trying to Bring Down the Indian Child Welfare Act. Why? Rebecca Clarren Kids also need champions and advocates, said Sheldon Spotted Elk, director of Indian Child Welfare at Casey Family Programs. He pointed to the work of Eileen Quintana, a celebrated Title VI administrator in Utah who, through her Ute dancing classes and dedication to students, is credited with raising American Indian graduation rates in her district from 37 percent when she started 20 years ago to 100 percent last year. A bill introduced earlier this year in the US Senate aims to develop more such teachers: It creates incentives, such as loan forgiveness and scholarships, for teachers who work in schools with a large population of Native students. 29 In 2016, the Obama administration signed a law that for the first time requires school districts to engage in \"timely and meaningful consultation [with tribes] on issues affecting American Indian and Alaska Native students\" or risk losing federal aid. Such partnerships may help to keep Native kids in school and supported. For example, the Chickasaw Nation, based in Oklahoma, now receives notification from the school district when students are truant, triggering a tribally led process to contact families and provide wraparound services for the students to keep them in school. 30 So far, the Trump administration hasn't shown interest in improving the circumstances for Native students. Instead, the budget proposed by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos would eliminate more than $4 billion from the programs that support Native kids. DeVos advocates a voucher system, which would provide students with public money to attend private schools. But to use these vouchers, most tribal students would have to travel more than 70 miles round-trip to get to and from school. DeVos also promotes virtual schools like the trailer in Warm Springs, where students learn primarily from computer programs. 31 B ack on the Warm Springs reservation, the incoming superintendent of the 509J School District, Ken Parshall, told me that he is \"passionate about making brighter outcomes for my students.\" A pilot program launched this past year helps the current support staff earn a teaching license; one Native teacher from that program is now applying for a job with the district. 32 Failure doesn't have to be a destiny for Native American students. Savannah Holliday, the student who was expelled in every year of middle school, went on to receive a full scholarship to Southern Oregon University, where she plans to study forensic pathology. She credited her success to her mother and her participation in a traditional-dancing group. 33 When we met, Holliday was wearing her traditional dress, bedecked with purple and blue beads and shells. \"In order to be successful, you need to know who you are,\" she said. \"The dances help me identify who I am and where I come from. Everything at Madras High School is not of my culture, but at dance practice I fit in, and I feel less alone.\" 34\n\nHarsh discipline and low graduation rates can limit the economic and social opportunities for students beyond their teenage years. Low graduation rates contribute to high unemployment on reservations, as well as diminished levels of home ownership. Though Native Americans are regularly omitted from national studies, in large part due to their small population size, studies of other minority groups have found that being expelled or dropping out of school is also associated with higher incarceration rates. Plus the suicide rate among Native teens is one and a half times higher than the national average, according to the Centers for Disease Control; it's likely that negative experiences in school, including expulsion or suspension, are associated with this epidemic, said Dr. R. Dale Walker, the director of Oregon Health and Science University's Center for American Indian Health Education and Research. 10 Last year, less than two-thirds of the tribal members enrolled in the 509J School District graduated. \"Why the heck aren't we doing better, and why has it taken so long? I just go, 'Ugh!'\" said Rick Molitor, the superintendent of the 509J School District for the past nine years. (He retired on July 1.) Molitor adds that the high disciplinary rates stem, in large part, from a lack of cultural understanding among teachers. In the past two years, he's been working with the Warm Springs tribe to increase cultural programming in the schools, and he credits new facilities and programs like Bridges with helping to increase the graduation rate. Even so, \"we have a long ways to go,\" he acknowledged. \"I've been going out to Warm Springs and saying, 'We're failing our Native American kids.' There's no way we can come forward and say we're being successful.\" 11 I n late June, the ACLU of Montana supported a formal complaint with both the US Department of Education and the Department of Justice alleging that a school district in rural Montana discriminates against students who are citizens of the Assiniboine and Sioux nations. \"Native students have been systematically disadvantaged in comparison to their non-Native peers through racially biased enforcement of school discipline policies, inequitable access to school activities, and verbal abuse by teachers and staff,\" attorney Melina Healey asserted in a statement announcing the complaint. (Schools receiving public money are required to abide by federal anti-discrimination laws, including Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.) 12 The Montana complaint also alleges that the district mismanages the Native-specific federal funding that is allocated by Congress to support Native students and fulfill treaty obligations. Many tribes describe this money as critical for their students. Without it, kids in places like Putnam City, Oklahoma, might go without backpacks, calculators, or caps and gowns at graduation. Districts in other states use the funds to support students by sponsoring Native American clubs, powwows, and Native music or language classes. 13 Despite their importance, these federal funding programs are loosely managed. The Johnson O'Malley program, created in 1934 to fund basic educational needs of Native students, disperses money based on the number of enrolled tribal members attending public school. Congress hasn't completed the necessary population survey since 1994, while the number of Native students has grown by approximately 4 percent per year-meaning that the same pool of money authorized in 1994 must now cover far more children. In 1995, the federal government allocated $125 per student; last year, the allotment was just $63.80. President Trump's proposed budget would cut program spending even further, by 30 percent. Over a year ago, Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota introduced a bill that would update the survey; it hasn't gotten out of committee. 14 The other major source of federal money specifically earmarked for Native students are Title VI grants, which school districts use to enhance the educational experience of Native kids through things like music or language classes. The US Department of Education conducts only cursory audits of the program, and it fails to ensure that the money is targeted specifically to Native students, rather than the student body at large. 15 Tribal members in other areas share the Assiniboine and Sioux nations' concern about mismanagement of this funding, which amounts to more than $100 million each year nationally. Attempts to learn how Oregon's 509J School District and others use the funds revealed a lack of transparency and oversight. \"Many tribes are regularly concerned about how exactly districts are spending the money intended to help our children,\" said Quinton Roman Nose, executive director of the Tribal Education Departments National Assembly, via e-mail. \"Often when we ask for specific details on where the money goes, we get a broad budget that doesn't provide answers to questions being asked by tribes and parents. Ultimately, there's the golden rule: He who has the gold rules. And the schools are the grantees; they've got the money, and they can do with it whatever they want.\" 16 T he roots of the current crisis in American Indian education were planted 138 years ago, when the great-great-great-grandparents of today's students were children. Seen as an enlightened alternative to genocide, the federal government and a network of churches created hundreds of Indian boarding schools intended to assimilate Native Americans and eradicate their culture. If Native parents didn't send their children away to these schools, agents of the Department of the Interior were authorized to arrest them or withhold food (provided in exchange for land), which for most families meant starvation. 17 I felt worthless-like I wasn't worth the effort or patience to understand who I am or my history.\" -Warm Springs Councilwoman Carina Miller \"Education affords the true solution to the Indian problem...only by complete isolation of the Indian child from his savage antecedents can he be satisfactorily educated,\" Indian School Superintendent John B. Riley declared in 1886. In these boarding schools, which persisted into the 1970s, Native children weren't allowed to speak their own language, practice their culture, or see their family on a regular basis. Some students were physically or sexually abused by their teachers or dormitory supervisors. Many returned to their families and tribal communities deeply scarred. Dr. Susan Faircloth, a professor of education at the University of North Carolina, Wil- mington, and a member of the Coharie tribe, pointed out that this history \"make[s] it difficult, if not impossible, for many American Indian families and their children to fully engage with schools and educators.\" 18 Today, there are no Native classroom teachers or administrators at Madras High School, the large public school serving the Warm Springs reservation. \"The reason why behaviors are so bad here in this district is that teachers aren't culturally aware,\" said Ellise David, a senior at the school, which has a student body that is one-third Native American, one-third Hispanic, and one-third white. David, a member of the school board and the Indian Education Committee for the tribe, added that many teachers don't understand the challenges that Native students and their families face-for example, getting to a teacher conference on time if they don't have a car. \"I hate teachers who are more like, 'I'm only here to teach-I'm not here to know your family,'\" David said. \"Being aware of what the students go through-not just Native students, but Hispanics too-will help the teachers manage their classrooms.\" 19 Most of the parents, teachers, and students in Warm Springs whom I interviewed for this story were afraid that if they were quoted, the district would somehow punish them. One teacher that I interviewed on background was placed on administrative leave, ostensibly out of concern that she had shared confidential information about students during our conversation, according to an investigator that the district hired, who contacted me. (She hadn't.) 20 Again, the lack of Native teachers and administrators isn't unique to Madras. Less than 1 percent of educators nationwide are American Indian or Alaska Native. This is a real problem, because having teachers of one's own race can be a key to educational success: A recent study of 100,000 black students found that if they had at least one African-American teacher between third and fifth grade, their chances of dropping out declined by 29 percent. Though the Office of Indian Education has a grant program intended to create more Native teachers and administrators, the program is mismanaged, according to a 2010 audit by the Department of Education inspector general's office-leading to waste, fraud, and abuse, as well as a failure to fund projects that conduct significant training. (The OIE declined to answer whether it had made any reforms since the audit.) 21 This dearth of Native teachers is mirrored by the lack of lessons about Native Americans taught to public-school students across the country. Eighty-seven percent of the references to American Indians in the various state academic standards, upon which textbooks are based, concern events that happened before 1900, according to one 2015 study; only Arizona, Washington, Oklahoma, and Kansas teach about the boarding schools. Though the situation is better than it was 50 years ago, Native American content in school textbooks still perpetuates cultural stereotypes, while few textbooks convey the tribal perspectives on historical events and cultural concerns, according to a 2012 survey. (For example, some Nebraska textbooks have described American Indians as lazy and drunk.) 22 \"For more than a century, we've made Natives understand the non-Native culture and adjust accordingly, and it does not work. It's not reciprocal-it's assimilation,\" said Ahniwake Rose, executive director of the National Indian Education Association. \"Native students are often only shown small and very specific reflections of themselves in school-usually lesson plans around the 'Thanksgiving story,' or 'Indian pride' in the context of a school mascot. These reflections are so wrong, so totally off base, that our students disengage from learning.\" 23 For both Native and non-Native teachers who want to help their Native students thrive, there is a paucity of available research to guide their efforts. Because of their relatively small numbers in the overall population, Native students often don't get studied. Indian educational leaders refer to themselves as the \"Asterisk Nation\": \"an asterisk, instead of [a] data point, is often used in data displays,\" reports the National Congress of American Indians. 24 Without reliable data and research, government agencies at every level don't know how to fix problems or allocate funds. This lack of understanding filters down to the classrooms of local schools, where teachers and administrators are often ignorant about their Native students. For example, Warm Springs and other tribes hold funeral ceremonies that last for several weeks; some school districts expel students who miss so many classes. According to a 2013 Office for Civil Rights complaint made by California's Wiyot tribe against the local school district for a range of mistreatment, teachers regularly touched their Native students' long hair, which is culturally offensive. 25 Native students are disciplined at roughly two times the rate of their white peers.

The US Department of Education conducts only cursory audits of the program, and it fails to ensure that the money is targeted specifically to Native students, rather than the student body at large. 15 Tribal members in other areas share the Assiniboine and Sioux nations' concern about mismanagement of this funding, which amounts to more than $100 million each year nationally. Attempts to learn how Oregon's 509J School District and others use the funds revealed a lack of transparency and oversight. \"Many tribes are regularly concerned about how exactly districts are spending the money intended to help our children,\" said Quinton Roman Nose, executive director of the Tribal Education Departments National Assembly, via e-mail. \"Often when we ask for specific details on where the money goes, we get a broad budget that doesn't provide answers to questions being asked by tribes and parents. Ultimately, there's the golden rule: He who has the gold rules. And the schools are the grantees; they've got the money, and they can do with it whatever they want.\" 16 T he roots of the current crisis in American Indian education were planted 138 years ago, when the great-great-great-grandparents of today's students were children. Seen as an enlightened alternative to genocide, the federal government and a network of churches created hundreds of Indian boarding schools intended to assimilate Native Americans and eradicate their culture. If Native parents didn't send their children away to these schools, agents of the Department of the Interior were authorized to arrest them or withhold food (provided in exchange for land), which for most families meant starvation. 17 I felt worthless-like I wasn't worth the effort or patience to understand who I am or my history.\" -Warm Springs Councilwoman Carina Miller \"Education affords the true solution to the Indian problem...only by complete isolation of the Indian child from his savage antecedents can he be satisfactorily educated,\" Indian School Superintendent John B. Riley declared in 1886. In these boarding schools, which persisted into the 1970s, Native children weren't allowed to speak their own language, practice their culture, or see their family on a regular basis. Some students were physically or sexually abused by their teachers or dormitory supervisors. Many returned to their families and tribal communities deeply scarred. Dr. Susan Faircloth, a professor of education at the University of North Carolina, Wil- mington, and a member of the Coharie tribe, pointed out that this history \"make[s] it difficult, if not impossible, for many American Indian families and their children to fully engage with schools and educators.\" 18 Today, there are no Native classroom teachers or administrators at Madras High School, the large public school serving the Warm Springs reservation. \"The reason why behaviors are so bad here in this district is that teachers aren't culturally aware,\" said Ellise David, a senior at the school, which has a student body that is one-third Native American, one-third Hispanic, and one-third white. David, a member of the school board and the Indian Education Committee for the tribe, added that many teachers don't understand the challenges that Native students and their families face-for example, getting to a teacher conference on time if they don't have a car. \"I hate teachers who are more like, 'I'm only here to teach-I'm not here to know your family,'\" David said. \"Being aware of what the students go through-not just Native students, but Hispanics too-will help the teachers manage their classrooms.\" 19 Most of the parents, teachers, and students in Warm Springs whom I interviewed for this story were afraid that if they were quoted, the district would somehow punish them. One teacher that I interviewed on background was placed on administrative leave, ostensibly out of concern that she had shared confidential information about students during our conversation, according to an investigator that the district hired, who contacted me. (She hadn't.) 20 Again, the lack of Native teachers and administrators isn't unique to Madras. Less than 1 percent of educators nationwide are American Indian or Alaska Native. This is a real problem, because having teachers of one's own race can be a key to educational success: A recent study of 100,000 black students found that if they had at least one African-American teacher between third and fifth grade, their chances of dropping out declined by 29 percent. Though the Office of Indian Education has a grant program intended to create more Native teachers and administrators, the program is mismanaged, according to a 2010 audit by the Department of Education inspector general's office-leading to waste, fraud, and abuse, as well as a failure to fund projects that conduct significant training. (The OIE declined to answer whether it had made any reforms since the audit.) 21 This dearth of Native teachers is mirrored by the lack of lessons about Native Americans taught to public-school students across the country. Eighty-seven percent of the references to American Indians in the various state academic standards, upon which textbooks are based, concern events that happened before 1900, according to one 2015 study; only Arizona, Washington, Oklahoma, and Kansas teach about the boarding schools. Though the situation is better than it was 50 years ago, Native American content in school textbooks still perpetuates cultural stereotypes, while few textbooks convey the tribal perspectives on historical events and cultural concerns, according to a 2012 survey. (For example, some Nebraska textbooks have described American Indians as lazy and drunk.) 22 \"For more than a century, we've made Natives understand the non-Native culture and adjust accordingly, and it does not work. It's not reciprocal-it's assimilation,\" said Ahniwake Rose, executive director of the National Indian Education Association. \"Native students are often only shown small and very specific reflections of themselves in school-usually lesson plans around the 'Thanksgiving story,' or 'Indian pride' in the context of a school mascot. These reflections are so wrong, so totally off base, that our students disengage from learning.\" 23 For both Native and non-Native teachers who want to help their Native students thrive, there is a paucity of available research to guide their efforts. Because of their relatively small numbers in the overall population, Native students often don't get studied. Indian educational leaders refer to themselves as the \"Asterisk Nation\": \"an asterisk, instead of [a] data point, is often used in data displays,\" reports the National Congress of American Indians. 24 Without reliable data and research, government agencies at every level don't know how to fix problems or allocate funds. This lack of understanding filters down to the classrooms of local schools, where teachers and administrators are often ignorant about their Native students. For example, Warm Springs and other tribes hold funeral ceremonies that last for several weeks; some school districts expel students who miss so many classes. According to a 2013 Office for Civil Rights complaint made by California's Wiyot tribe against the local school district for a range of mistreatment, teachers regularly touched their Native students' long hair, which is culturally offensive. 25 Native students are disciplined at roughly two times the rate of their white peers. L ast winter, I watched Laura Lynn, an educational trainer and professor at the University of Washington's new Native Education Certificate program, teach a fifth-grade lesson on colonization. She studied a crayon drawing made by a student who'd been asked to depict a place that was sacred to her. \"I like this part of the beach you made,\" Lynn said, ripping off a corner of the paper. The class grew silent. She continued to tear the paper. \"I think I'll keep it.\" 26 Lynn's students were actually middle- and high-school teachers attending a series of statewide training sessions mandated by a state law-long on the books but only fully funded last year-that requires school districts to teach the history, government, and culture of their local tribes, using curriculums created and vetted by tribal people. \"To come out of high school and not learn about the colonization of Native people is not right.\" 27 Research shows that Native kids are more likely to thrive, to stay out of trouble and stay in school, when they learn about their culture and language. To that end, a small but growing number of states like Washington now encourage or require that Indian Education be taught to all students, at all levels of schooling. To expand such teaching nationwide, this past spring the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian launched Native Knowledge 360, a free online resource of interactive lessons and educational resources that teachers of all grades and subject areas can use. 28 Related Article A Right-Wing Think Tank Is Trying to Bring Down the Indian Child Welfare Act. Why? Rebecca Clarren Kids also need champions and advocates, said Sheldon Spotted Elk, director of Indian Child Welfare at Casey Family Programs. He pointed to the work of Eileen Quintana, a celebrated Title VI administrator in Utah who, through her Ute dancing classes and dedication to students, is credited with raising American Indian graduation rates in her district from 37 percent when she started 20 years ago to 100 percent last year. A bill introduced earlier this year in the US Senate aims to develop more such teachers: It creates incentives, such as loan forgiveness and scholarships, for teachers who work in schools with a large population of Native students. 29 In 2016, the Obama administration signed a law that for the first time requires school districts to engage in \"timely and meaningful consultation [with tribes] on issues affecting American Indian and Alaska Native students\" or risk losing federal aid. Such partnerships may help to keep Native kids in school and supported. For example, the Chickasaw Nation, based in Oklahoma, now receives notification from the school district when students are truant, triggering a tribally led process to contact families and provide wraparound services for the students to keep them in school. 30 So far, the Trump administration hasn't shown interest in improving the circumstances for Native students. Instead, the budget proposed by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos would eliminate more than $4 billion from the programs that support Native kids. DeVos advocates a voucher system, which would provide students with public money to attend private schools. But to use these vouchers, most tribal students would have to travel more than 70 miles round-trip to get to and from school. DeVos also promotes virtual schools like the trailer in Warm Springs, where students learn primarily from computer programs. 31 B ack on the Warm Springs reservation, the incoming superintendent of the 509J School District, Ken Parshall, told me that he is \"passionate about making brighter outcomes for my students.\" A pilot program launched this past year helps the current support staff earn a teaching license; one Native teacher from that program is now applying for a job with the district. 32 Failure doesn't have to be a destiny for Native American students. Savannah Holliday, the student who was expelled in every year of middle school, went on to receive a full scholarship to Southern Oregon University, where she plans to study forensic pathology. She credited her success to her mother and her participation in a traditional-dancing group. 33 When we met, Holliday was wearing her traditional dress, bedecked with purple and blue beads and shells. \"In order to be successful, you need to know who you are,\" she said. \"The dances help me identify who I am and where I come from. Everything at Madras High School is not of my culture, but at dance practice I fit in, and I feel less alone.\" 34\n\nThe Montana complaint also alleges that the district mismanages the Native-specific federal funding that is allocated by Congress to support Native students and fulfill treaty obligations. Many tribes describe this money as critical for their students. Without it, kids in places like Putnam City, Oklahoma, might go without backpacks, calculators, or caps and gowns at graduation. Districts in other states use the funds to support students by sponsoring Native American clubs, powwows, and Native music or language classes. 13 Despite their importance, these federal funding programs are loosely managed. The Johnson O'Malley program, created in 1934 to fund basic educational needs of Native students, disperses money based on the number of enrolled tribal members attending public school. Congress hasn't completed the necessary population survey since 1994, while the number of Native students has grown by approximately 4 percent per year-meaning that the same pool of money authorized in 1994 must now cover far more children. In 1995, the federal government allocated $125 per student; last year, the allotment was just $63.80. President Trump's proposed budget would cut program spending even further, by 30 percent. Over a year ago, Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota introduced a bill that would update the survey; it hasn't gotten out of committee. 14 The other major source of federal money specifically earmarked for Native students are Title VI grants, which school districts use to enhance the educational experience of Native kids through things like music or language classes.

Savannah Holliday, the student who was expelled in every year of middle school, went on to receive a full scholarship to Southern Oregon University, where she plans to study forensic pathology. She credited her success to her mother and her participation in a traditional-dancing group. 33 When we met, Holliday was wearing her traditional dress, bedecked with purple and blue beads and shells. \"In order to be successful, you need to know who you are,\" she said. \"The dances help me identify who I am and where I come from. Everything at Madras High School is not of my culture, but at dance practice I fit in, and I feel less alone.\" 34\n\nThe other major source of federal money specifically earmarked for Native students are Title VI grants, which school districts use to enhance the educational experience of Native kids through things like music or language classes. The US Department of Education conducts only cursory audits of the program, and it fails to ensure that the money is targeted specifically to Native students, rather than the student body at large. 15 Tribal members in other areas share the Assiniboine and Sioux nations' concern about mismanagement of this funding, which amounts to more than $100 million each year nationally. Attempts to learn how Oregon's 509J School District and others use the funds revealed a lack of transparency and oversight. \"Many tribes are regularly concerned about how exactly districts are spending the money intended to help our children,\" said Quinton Roman Nose, executive director of the Tribal Education Departments National Assembly, via e-mail. \"Often when we ask for specific details on where the money goes, we get a broad budget that doesn't provide answers to questions being asked by tribes and parents. Ultimately, there's the golden rule: He who has the gold rules. And the schools are the grantees; they've got the money, and they can do with it whatever they want.\" 16 T he roots of the current crisis in American Indian education were planted 138 years ago, when the great-great-great-grandparents of today's students were children. Seen as an enlightened alternative to genocide, the federal government and a network of churches created hundreds of Indian boarding schools intended to assimilate Native Americans and eradicate their culture. If Native parents didn't send their children away to these schools, agents of the Department of the Interior were authorized to arrest them or withhold food (provided in exchange for land), which for most families meant starvation. 17 I felt worthless-like I wasn't worth the effort or patience to understand who I am or my history.\" -Warm Springs Councilwoman Carina Miller \"Education affords the true solution to the Indian problem...only by complete isolation of the Indian child from his savage antecedents can he be satisfactorily educated,\" Indian School Superintendent John B. Riley declared in 1886. In these boarding schools, which persisted into the 1970s, Native children weren't allowed to speak their own language, practice their culture, or see their family on a regular basis. Some students were physically or sexually abused by their teachers or dormitory supervisors. Many returned to their families and tribal communities deeply scarred. Dr. Susan Faircloth, a professor of education at the University of North Carolina, Wil- mington, and a member of the Coharie tribe, pointed out that this history \"make[s] it difficult, if not impossible, for many American Indian families and their children to fully engage with schools and educators.\" 18 Today, there are no Native classroom teachers or administrators at Madras High School, the large public school serving the Warm Springs reservation. \"The reason why behaviors are so bad here in this district is that teachers aren't culturally aware,\" said Ellise David, a senior at the school, which has a student body that is one-third Native American, one-third Hispanic, and one-third white. David, a member of the school board and the Indian Education Committee for the tribe, added that many teachers don't understand the challenges that Native students and their families face-for example, getting to a teacher conference on time if they don't have a car. \"I hate teachers who are more like, 'I'm only here to teach-I'm not here to know your family,'\" David said. \"Being aware of what the students go through-not just Native students, but Hispanics too-will help the teachers manage their classrooms.\" 19 Most of the parents, teachers, and students in Warm Springs whom I interviewed for this story were afraid that if they were quoted, the district would somehow punish them. One teacher that I interviewed on background was placed on administrative leave, ostensibly out of concern that she had shared confidential information about students during our conversation, according to an investigator that the district hired, who contacted me. (She hadn't.) 20 Again, the lack of Native teachers and administrators isn't unique to Madras. Less than 1 percent of educators nationwide are American Indian or Alaska Native. This is a real problem, because having teachers of one's own race can be a key to educational success: A recent study of 100,000 black students found that if they had at least one African-American teacher between third and fifth grade, their chances of dropping out declined by 29 percent. Though the Office of Indian Education has a grant program intended to create more Native teachers and administrators, the program is mismanaged, according to a 2010 audit by the Department of Education inspector general's office-leading to waste, fraud, and abuse, as well as a failure to fund projects that conduct significant training. (The OIE declined to answer whether it had made any reforms since the audit.) 21 This dearth of Native teachers is mirrored by the lack of lessons about Native Americans taught to public-school students across the country. Eighty-seven percent of the references to American Indians in the various state academic standards, upon which textbooks are based, concern events that happened before 1900, according to one 2015 study; only Arizona, Washington, Oklahoma, and Kansas teach about the boarding schools. Though the situation is better than it was 50 years ago, Native American content in school textbooks still perpetuates cultural stereotypes, while few textbooks convey the tribal perspectives on historical events and cultural concerns, according to a 2012 survey. (For example, some Nebraska textbooks have described American Indians as lazy and drunk.) 22 \"For more than a century, we've made Natives understand the non-Native culture and adjust accordingly, and it does not work. It's not reciprocal-it's assimilation,\" said Ahniwake Rose, executive director of the National Indian Education Association. \"Native students are often only shown small and very specific reflections of themselves in school-usually lesson plans around the 'Thanksgiving story,' or 'Indian pride' in the context of a school mascot. These reflections are so wrong, so totally off base, that our students disengage from learning.\" 23 For both Native and non-Native teachers who want to help their Native students thrive, there is a paucity of available research to guide their efforts. Because of their relatively small numbers in the overall population, Native students often don't get studied. Indian educational leaders refer to themselves as the \"Asterisk Nation\": \"an asterisk, instead of [a] data point, is often used in data displays,\" reports the National Congress of American Indians. 24 Without reliable data and research, government agencies at every level don't know how to fix problems or allocate funds. This lack of understanding filters down to the classrooms of local schools, where teachers and administrators are often ignorant about their Native students. For example, Warm Springs and other tribes hold funeral ceremonies that last for several weeks; some school districts expel students who miss so many classes. According to a 2013 Office for Civil Rights complaint made by California's Wiyot tribe against the local school district for a range of mistreatment, teachers regularly touched their Native students' long hair, which is culturally offensive. 25 Native students are disciplined at roughly two times the rate of their white peers. L ast winter, I watched Laura Lynn, an educational trainer and professor at the University of Washington's new Native Education Certificate program, teach a fifth-grade lesson on colonization. She studied a crayon drawing made by a student who'd been asked to depict a place that was sacred to her. \"I like this part of the beach you made,\" Lynn said, ripping off a corner of the paper. The class grew silent. She continued to tear the paper. \"I think I'll keep it.\" 26 Lynn's students were actually middle- and high-school teachers attending a series of statewide training sessions mandated by a state law-long on the books but only fully funded last year-that requires school districts to teach the history, government, and culture of their local tribes, using curriculums created and vetted by tribal people. \"To come out of high school and not learn about the colonization of Native people is not right.\" 27 Research shows that Native kids are more likely to thrive, to stay out of trouble and stay in school, when they learn about their culture and language. To that end, a small but growing number of states like Washington now encourage or require that Indian Education be taught to all students, at all levels of schooling. To expand such teaching nationwide, this past spring the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian launched Native Knowledge 360, a free online resource of interactive lessons and educational resources that teachers of all grades and subject areas can use. 28 Related Article A Right-Wing Think Tank Is Trying to Bring Down the Indian Child Welfare Act. Why? Rebecca Clarren Kids also need champions and advocates, said Sheldon Spotted Elk, director of Indian Child Welfare at Casey Family Programs. He pointed to the work of Eileen Quintana, a celebrated Title VI administrator in Utah who, through her Ute dancing classes and dedication to students, is credited with raising American Indian graduation rates in her district from 37 percent when she started 20 years ago to 100 percent last year. A bill introduced earlier this year in the US Senate aims to develop more such teachers: It creates incentives, such as loan forgiveness and scholarships, for teachers who work in schools with a large population of Native students. 29 In 2016, the Obama administration signed a law that for the first time requires school districts to engage in \"timely and meaningful consultation [with tribes] on issues affecting American Indian and Alaska Native students\" or risk losing federal aid. Such partnerships may help to keep Native kids in school and supported. For example, the Chickasaw Nation, based in Oklahoma, now receives notification from the school district when students are truant, triggering a tribally led process to contact families and provide wraparound services for the students to keep them in school. 30 So far, the Trump administration hasn't shown interest in improving the circumstances for Native students. Instead, the budget proposed by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos would eliminate more than $4 billion from the programs that support Native kids. DeVos advocates a voucher system, which would provide students with public money to attend private schools. But to use these vouchers, most tribal students would have to travel more than 70 miles round-trip to get to and from school.

(She hadn't.) 20 Again, the lack of Native teachers and administrators isn't unique to Madras. Less than 1 percent of educators nationwide are American Indian or Alaska Native. This is a real problem, because having teachers of one's own race can be a key to educational success: A recent study of 100,000 black students found that if they had at least one African-American teacher between third and fifth grade, their chances of dropping out declined by 29 percent. Though the Office of Indian Education has a grant program intended to create more Native teachers and administrators, the program is mismanaged, according to a 2010 audit by the Department of Education inspector general's office-leading to waste, fraud, and abuse, as well as a failure to fund projects that conduct significant training. (The OIE declined to answer whether it had made any reforms since the audit.) 21 This dearth of Native teachers is mirrored by the lack of lessons about Native Americans taught to public-school students across the country. Eighty-seven percent of the references to American Indians in the various state academic standards, upon which textbooks are based, concern events that happened before 1900, according to one 2015 study; only Arizona, Washington, Oklahoma, and Kansas teach about the boarding schools. Though the situation is better than it was 50 years ago, Native American content in school textbooks still perpetuates cultural stereotypes, while few textbooks convey the tribal perspectives on historical events and cultural concerns, according to a 2012 survey. (For example, some Nebraska textbooks have described American Indians as lazy and drunk.) 22 \"For more than a century, we've made Natives understand the non-Native culture and adjust accordingly, and it does not work. It's not reciprocal-it's assimilation,\" said Ahniwake Rose, executive director of the National Indian Education Association. \"Native students are often only shown small and very specific reflections of themselves in school-usually lesson plans around the 'Thanksgiving story,' or 'Indian pride' in the context of a school mascot. These reflections are so wrong, so totally off base, that our students disengage from learning.\" 23 For both Native and non-Native teachers who want to help their Native students thrive, there is a paucity of available research to guide their efforts. Because of their relatively small numbers in the overall population, Native students often don't get studied. Indian educational leaders refer to themselves as the \"Asterisk Nation\": \"an asterisk, instead of [a] data point, is often used in data displays,\" reports the National Congress of American Indians. 24 Without reliable data and research, government agencies at every level don't know how to fix problems or allocate funds. This lack of understanding filters down to the classrooms of local schools, where teachers and administrators are often ignorant about their Native students. For example, Warm Springs and other tribes hold funeral ceremonies that last for several weeks; some school districts expel students who miss so many classes. According to a 2013 Office for Civil Rights complaint made by California's Wiyot tribe against the local school district for a range of mistreatment, teachers regularly touched their Native students' long hair, which is culturally offensive. 25 Native students are disciplined at roughly two times the rate of their white peers. L ast winter, I watched Laura Lynn, an educational trainer and professor at the University of Washington's new Native Education Certificate program, teach a fifth-grade lesson on colonization. She studied a crayon drawing made by a student who'd been asked to depict a place that was sacred to her. \"I like this part of the beach you made,\" Lynn said, ripping off a corner of the paper. The class grew silent. She continued to tear the paper. \"I think I'll keep it.\" 26 Lynn's students were actually middle- and high-school teachers attending a series of statewide training sessions mandated by a state law-long on the books but only fully funded last year-that requires school districts to teach the history, government, and culture of their local tribes, using curriculums created and vetted by tribal people. \"To come out of high school and not learn about the colonization of Native people is not right.\" 27 Research shows that Native kids are more likely to thrive, to stay out of trouble and stay in school, when they learn about their culture and language. To that end, a small but growing number of states like Washington now encourage or require that Indian Education be taught to all students, at all levels of schooling. To expand such teaching nationwide, this past spring the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian launched Native Knowledge 360, a free online resource of interactive lessons and educational resources that teachers of all grades and subject areas can use. 28 Related Article A Right-Wing Think Tank Is Trying to Bring Down the Indian Child Welfare Act. Why? Rebecca Clarren Kids also need champions and advocates, said Sheldon Spotted Elk, director of Indian Child Welfare at Casey Family Programs. He pointed to the work of Eileen Quintana, a celebrated Title VI administrator in Utah who, through her Ute dancing classes and dedication to students, is credited with raising American Indian graduation rates in her district from 37 percent when she started 20 years ago to 100 percent last year. A bill introduced earlier this year in the US Senate aims to develop more such teachers: It creates incentives, such as loan forgiveness and scholarships, for teachers who work in schools with a large population of Native students. 29 In 2016, the Obama administration signed a law that for the first time requires school districts to engage in \"timely and meaningful consultation [with tribes] on issues affecting American Indian and Alaska Native students\" or risk losing federal aid. Such partnerships may help to keep Native kids in school and supported. For example, the Chickasaw Nation, based in Oklahoma, now receives notification from the school district when students are truant, triggering a tribally led process to contact families and provide wraparound services for the students to keep them in school. 30 So far, the Trump administration hasn't shown interest in improving the circumstances for Native students. Instead, the budget proposed by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos would eliminate more than $4 billion from the programs that support Native kids. DeVos advocates a voucher system, which would provide students with public money to attend private schools. But to use these vouchers, most tribal students would have to travel more than 70 miles round-trip to get to and from school. DeVos also promotes virtual schools like the trailer in Warm Springs, where students learn primarily from computer programs. 31 B ack on the Warm Springs reservation, the incoming superintendent of the 509J School District, Ken Parshall, told me that he is \"passionate about making brighter outcomes for my students.\" A pilot program launched this past year helps the current support staff earn a teaching license; one Native teacher from that program is now applying for a job with the district. 32 Failure doesn't have to be a destiny for Native American students. Savannah Holliday, the student who was expelled in every year of middle school, went on to receive a full scholarship to Southern Oregon University, where she plans to study forensic pathology. She credited her success to her mother and her participation in a traditional-dancing group. 33 When we met, Holliday was wearing her traditional dress, bedecked with purple and blue beads and shells. \"In order to be successful, you need to know who you are,\" she said. \"The dances help me identify who I am and where I come from. Everything at Madras High School is not of my culture, but at dance practice I fit in, and I feel less alone.\" 34\n\nToday, there are no Native classroom teachers or administrators at Madras High School, the large public school serving the Warm Springs reservation. \"The reason why behaviors are so bad here in this district is that teachers aren't culturally aware,\" said Ellise David, a senior at the school, which has a student body that is one-third Native American, one-third Hispanic, and one-third white. David, a member of the school board and the Indian Education Committee for the tribe, added that many teachers don't understand the challenges that Native students and their families face-for example, getting to a teacher conference on time if they don't have a car. \"I hate teachers who are more like, 'I'm only here to teach-I'm not here to know your family,'\" David said. \"Being aware of what the students go through-not just Native students, but Hispanics too-will help the teachers manage their classrooms.\" 19 Most of the parents, teachers, and students in Warm Springs whom I interviewed for this story were afraid that if they were quoted, the district would somehow punish them.

Why? Rebecca Clarren Kids also need champions and advocates, said Sheldon Spotted Elk, director of Indian Child Welfare at Casey Family Programs. He pointed to the work of Eileen Quintana, a celebrated Title VI administrator in Utah who, through her Ute dancing classes and dedication to students, is credited with raising American Indian graduation rates in her district from 37 percent when she started 20 years ago to 100 percent last year. A bill introduced earlier this year in the US Senate aims to develop more such teachers: It creates incentives, such as loan forgiveness and scholarships, for teachers who work in schools with a large population of Native students. 29 In 2016, the Obama administration signed a law that for the first time requires school districts to engage in \"timely and meaningful consultation [with tribes] on issues affecting American Indian and Alaska Native students\" or risk losing federal aid. Such partnerships may help to keep Native kids in school and supported. For example, the Chickasaw Nation, based in Oklahoma, now receives notification from the school district when students are truant, triggering a tribally led process to contact families and provide wraparound services for the students to keep them in school. 30 So far, the Trump administration hasn't shown interest in improving the circumstances for Native students. Instead, the budget proposed by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos would eliminate more than $4 billion from the programs that support Native kids. DeVos advocates a voucher system, which would provide students with public money to attend private schools. But to use these vouchers, most tribal students would have to travel more than 70 miles round-trip to get to and from school. DeVos also promotes virtual schools like the trailer in Warm Springs, where students learn primarily from computer programs. 31 B ack on the Warm Springs reservation, the incoming superintendent of the 509J School District, Ken Parshall, told me that he is \"passionate about making brighter outcomes for my students.\" A pilot program launched this past year helps the current support staff earn a teaching license; one Native teacher from that program is now applying for a job with the district. 32 Failure doesn't have to be a destiny for Native American students. Savannah Holliday, the student who was expelled in every year of middle school, went on to receive a full scholarship to Southern Oregon University, where she plans to study forensic pathology. She credited her success to her mother and her participation in a traditional-dancing group. 33 When we met, Holliday was wearing her traditional dress, bedecked with purple and blue beads and shells. \"In order to be successful, you need to know who you are,\" she said. \"The dances help me identify who I am and where I come from. Everything at Madras High School is not of my culture, but at dance practice I fit in, and I feel less alone.\" 34\n\n\"For more than a century, we've made Natives understand the non-Native culture and adjust accordingly, and it does not work. It's not reciprocal-it's assimilation,\" said Ahniwake Rose, executive director of the National Indian Education Association. \"Native students are often only shown small and very specific reflections of themselves in school-usually lesson plans around the 'Thanksgiving story,' or 'Indian pride' in the context of a school mascot. These reflections are so wrong, so totally off base, that our students disengage from learning.\" 23 For both Native and non-Native teachers who want to help their Native students thrive, there is a paucity of available research to guide their efforts. Because of their relatively small numbers in the overall population, Native students often don't get studied. Indian educational leaders refer to themselves as the \"Asterisk Nation\": \"an asterisk, instead of [a] data point, is often used in data displays,\" reports the National Congress of American Indians. 24 Without reliable data and research, government agencies at every level don't know how to fix problems or allocate funds. This lack of understanding filters down to the classrooms of local schools, where teachers and administrators are often ignorant about their Native students. For example, Warm Springs and other tribes hold funeral ceremonies that last for several weeks; some school districts expel students who miss so many classes. According to a 2013 Office for Civil Rights complaint made by California's Wiyot tribe against the local school district for a range of mistreatment, teachers regularly touched their Native students' long hair, which is culturally offensive. 25 Native students are disciplined at roughly two times the rate of their white peers. L ast winter, I watched Laura Lynn, an educational trainer and professor at the University of Washington's new Native Education Certificate program, teach a fifth-grade lesson on colonization. She studied a crayon drawing made by a student who'd been asked to depict a place that was sacred to her. \"I like this part of the beach you made,\" Lynn said, ripping off a corner of the paper. The class grew silent. She continued to tear the paper. \"I think I'll keep it.\" 26 Lynn's students were actually middle- and high-school teachers attending a series of statewide training sessions mandated by a state law-long on the books but only fully funded last year-that requires school districts to teach the history, government, and culture of their local tribes, using curriculums created and vetted by tribal people. \"To come out of high school and not learn about the colonization of Native people is not right.\" 27 Research shows that Native kids are more likely to thrive, to stay out of trouble and stay in school, when they learn about their culture and language.

DeVos also promotes virtual schools like the trailer in Warm Springs, where students learn primarily from computer programs. 31 B ack on the Warm Springs reservation, the incoming superintendent of the 509J School District, Ken Parshall, told me that he is \"passionate about making brighter outcomes for my students.\" A pilot program launched this past year helps the current support staff earn a teaching license; one Native teacher from that program is now applying for a job with the district. 32 Failure doesn't have to be a destiny for Native American students. Savannah Holliday, the student who was expelled in every year of middle school, went on to receive a full scholarship to Southern Oregon University, where she plans to study forensic pathology. She credited her success to her mother and her participation in a traditional-dancing group. 33 When we met, Holliday was wearing her traditional dress, bedecked with purple and blue beads and shells. \"In order to be successful, you need to know who you are,\" she said. \"The dances help me identify who I am and where I come from. Everything at Madras High School is not of my culture, but at dance practice I fit in, and I feel less alone.\" 34\n\nB ack on the Warm Springs reservation, the incoming superintendent of the 509J School District, Ken Parshall, told me that he is \"passionate about making brighter outcomes for my students.\" A pilot program launched this past year helps the current support staff earn a teaching license; one Native teacher from that program is now applying for a job with the district. 32 Failure doesn't have to be a destiny for Native American students.

Transfer to the Radisson Hotel Bismarck , located in the heart of downtown. Accompanying the group from Bismarck to Denver will be Dakota Wind Goodhouse . Dakota is an enrolled member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and a Native American Studies instructor at United Tribes Technical College, which is owned and operated by the three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold, the Spirit Lake Tribe, the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, and the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa Indians. Meet in the lobby at 2:00 p.m. to drive to the North Dakota Heritage Center & State Museum. Enjoy a welcome reception and dinner with fellow travelers.\n\nThis morning drive approximately one-hour to Knife River Indian Villages National Historic Site . This area was once a major trading and agricultural area and preserves the historic and archaeological remnants of bands of Hidatsa, Northern Plains Indians. After watching a short documentary, explore the site including taking a 1.3 mile loop trail. Driving back towards Bismarck, stop at the Double Ditch Indian Village , a large earth-lodge community inhabited by the Mandan Indians for nearly 300 years (AD 1490 - 1785), and once a center of trade between the Mandans, their nomadic neighbors, and later Euro-American traders. Enjoy lunch at Frieds restauarant. After lunch drive to the Bismarck Public Library to meet with Dr. Tami DeCoteau , an enrolled member of the Mandan, Hidatsa, Arikara Nation and a descendant of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa. Dr. DeCoteau is a clinical psychologist and a Trust-Based Relational Intervention (TBRI) practitioner and will discuss historical trauma in indigenous communities. Drive a short distance to visit the offices of Cheryl Kary , co-founder of the Sacred Pipe Resource Center (SPRC), a home-away from home for off-reservation Native Americans living in the area. The founders realazed the need for an organization to assist Native people and families who are living away from their homelands, while respecting the sovereign nature of their individual Tribal citizenship. Head to the United Tribes Technical College to meet with college President Dr. Leander R. MCDonald . Stop at Alley 5.5 and meet artist Melissa Gordon , who created a powerful Sitting Bull image in collaboration with local artist Butch and late local artist Sheila Rieman. This evening enjoy dinner at Peacock Alley .\n\nAfter breakfast head to the Standing Rock Reservation , home to the Lakota and Dakota people. The reservation consists of a land base of 2.8 million acres spread over North and South Dakota. Travel along Highway 1806, the Standing Rock National Native American Scenic Byway , an 86-mile route that climbs up and down the Missouri River breaks, and runs past buffalo herds and eagle's nests. Unspoiled by much of anything man-made, the road winds around hills and knolls and offers sweeping vistas across vast swathes of golden-colored fields. Stop at the community of Cannon Ball and meet with Phyllis Young , a former council member for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, she was one of the principal coordinator/organizers for Central Oceti Sakowin camp, the main camp of Water Protectors at Standing Rock. She is currently an organizer for the Lakota People's Law Project, a nonprofit law firm providing legal defense to water protectors in the aftermath of the Standing Rock DAPL struggle. Walk together to a viewpoint and see the statue that was installed to honor all those that made Sacred Stone Camp their home. The movement that camped here became the largest historical inter-tribal alliance in American history, with over 200 tribes represented. Visit the original burial site of Sitting Bull , who was assassinated on the western part of the reservation on December 15, 1890. Sitting Bull was a strong advocate for maintaining the land, rights and ways of the Lakota people. Close by is Standing Rock Monument . The name of Standing Rock derives from a stone held sacred by the Dakota/Lakota people. There are many stories about the revered stone, but all speak of it as a woman or woman and child who turned to stone. Drive to Fort Yates, the main town of Standing Rock, and enjoy a locally prepared lunch at the Community Center. We have invited members of the Standing Rock Tribal Council to join us. Later pass through the Cheyenne River Reservation and stop to meet with Julie Garreau , executive director at the Cheyenne River Youth Project , which was founded in 1988. This grassroots, not-for-profit organization is dedicated to providing the youth of the Cheyenne River Reservation with access to a vibrant and secure future through a wide variety of culturally sensitive and enduring programs, projects and facilities that ensure strong, self-sufficient families and communities. Continue on to Keystone and the K Bar S Lodge , tucked deep in the Black Hills. The hotel has views over Mt. Rushmore , an iconic symbol to many, but a painful reminder to the original inhabitants - the Lakota - of sacred land illegally annexed and as a celebration of presidents involved in the destruction of tribal life.\n\nDepart this morning for the Pine Ridge Reservation . Stop first at Kyle, and the inspiring Thunder Valley Community Center , which began 10 years ago when Jerome and Nick Tilsen and several of their peers decided they wanted to \"create models of change that will overpower intergenerational poverty and build momentum towards regional equity.\" Meeting the group will be Antone Morrison, the new Community Engagement Coordinator at Thunder Valley. Head toward the town of Pine Ridge, stopping at the site of the Massacre of Wounded Knee in 1890. The \"battle\" was actually a massacre where hundreds of unarmed Lakota women, children, and men, including Big Foot, were shot and killed by U.S. troops. The history of Wounded Knee would spur American Indian Movement (A.I.M.) activists to occupy the site in 1973. After lunch meet with Chase Iron Eyes , a Native American activist, attorney, politician, and a member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. He is also a member of the Lakota People's Law Project and a co-founder of the Native American news website, Last Real Indians . This afternoon meet with members of the Oglala Sioux Tribe at their tribal council offices. The Oglala Sioux Tribe has about 48,000 tribal citizens. Approximately 32,000 OST citizens live on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, one of the nation's largest reservations. Stop at the Red Cloud School, a private, Catholic, K-12 school run by the Jesuits in Oglala Lakota County. It serves Oglala Lakota Native American children on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Although the campus will be closed, the Heritage Center hosts an annual Red Cloud Indian art show, which brings together indigenous artists from all over the country. The Heritage Center will be open and we will stop to look at some of the art they have on display. Return to Keystone passing through the Badlands National Park. This evening meet with Sequoia Crosswhite , an enrolled member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe and a descendant of Chief War Eagle and Chief Swift Cloud. He is an accomplished musician, grass dancer and historian, and his handmade flutes and musical recordings uphold the traditions of his Lakota ancestors. There will be a chance to share his music with him tonight! Dinner at the hotel this evening.\n\nStop at the Wind Cave National Park , an important spot in the Emergence Story. In Lakota culture history is passed down to new generations through the spoken word. There are many different versions of the Emergence Story, varying from band to band and family to family. Prior to entering the cave, we will be able to watch a recorded presentation by Sina Bear Eagle, a member of the Oglala Lakota tribe, about the cave as the site of the Emergence Story, which is part of the larger Creation Story. Continue by road to Torrington, Wyoming for lunch with the Bread Doctor . After lunch drive for about another two and a half hours to Boulder to meet John EchoHawk , a Native American attorney, founder of the Native American Rights Fund , and a leading member of the Native American self-determination movement. The Native American Rights Fund is a non-profit law firm dedicated to protecting indigenous rights in the U.S. and around the world. EchoHawk has centered the Fund's focus around preserving tribes, protecting tribal resources, protecting human rights, ensuring government responsibility, expanding Indian law, and educating people about Indian issues. Continue on to Denver and the Downtown Renaissance Hotel , which was once the Colorado National Bank and features a series of murals focusing on early Indigenous history painted by mural painter, Mr. Allen True. Dinner is at leisure.\n\nDakota Goodhouse will be leaving the group this morning and we will be joined by Bird Red, a Southern Ute tribal member and a Ute singer who works at the Southern Ute Community Center. Bird was part of the documentary Spirit of the Peaks, a film about the struggle for balance between two worlds. Bird Red will be with the group for the duration of the tour. This morning meet with Danielle SeeWalker , a Húnkpap, a Lakota, and a citizen of Standing Rock Sioux Trie in North Dakota. She is an artist, writer and activist. Alongside her passion for creating visual art, Danielle is a freelance writer and recently published her first book titled \"Still Here: A Past to Present Insight of Native American People & Culture.\" Head to the offices of the American Indian College Fund ,  which invests in Native students and tribal college education to transform lives and communities. The fund was founded in 1989 and has been the nation's largest charity supporting Native student access to higher education. The College Fund provides scholarships, programming to improve Native American student access to higher education, and the support and tools for them to succeed once they are there. Meeting us will be Janna Steig , who will talk about their work. Depart Denver and drive just over an hour and a half to Fairplay for a very quick lunch. After lunch drive through spectacular landscapes stopping at the Great Sand Dunes National Park , home to the highest sand dunes in North America. The mountains, forests and dunes in the park are sacred to the Apache, Navajo, Ute, and Pueblo Indians. Continue on to Del Norte and the Windsor Hotel , one of Colorado's oldest hotels. Its constructions started soon after the town was founded in 1871. Enjoy dinner at the hotel.\n\nThis morning drive about two hours to Chimney Rock , an intimate, off-the-beaten path archaeological site located at the souther edge of the San Juan mountains. The site was home to the ancestors of the modern Pueblo Indians 1,000 years ago, and is of great spiritual significance to these tribes. (Our visit is subject to the site being open, which is scheduled for mid-May). Continue on to Bayfield and lunch at Hong's Garden , which is located in the heart of the Pine River Valley. After lunch head to Durango and Fort Lewis College. About a third of the FLC student body is Native American or Alaskan Native. Meeting the group will be Michael Watchman (an enrolled member of the Navajo Nation) who studied business management at Fort Lewis College. Drive to the Southern Ute Cultural Center and meet with museum educator, Raelynn Torres. Designed by Jones & Jones Architects who fashioned the Smithsonian's National Museum of the American Indian, the exceptional architecture and beauty of the building and landscape incorporate cultural symbolism and a connection to the land. Continue to Ignacio and check-in to the Sky Ute Casino Resort , located on the Southern Ute Reservation.  The oldest continuous residents of Colorado are the Ute Indians, who came into the present day United States along the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains. Dinner is at leisure this evening.\n\nThis morning meet with Linda Baker , a member of the Southern Ute Tribe and a Sky Ute Tribal Council member. Apart from having a wealth of experience and knowledge about the Southern Ute tribe, Linda is a talented deader and she specializes in Ute regalia and Bear Dance accessories for men, women,  and children. We will bring a picnic lunch with us to the Southern Ute Community where Bird Red will provide a tour. After lunch meet with the staff at the Southern Ute Drum , the tribe's biweekly community newspaper. Enjoy a farewell dinner this evening at Fox Fire Farms , a small winery producing handcrafted wines.\n\nIndependent transfers for return flights home from Durango.\n\nPer person double occupancy: $6,120\n\nSingle supplement: $1,240\n\nThis tour is based on a minimum of 15 travelers.

And so to begin the story of Georgia's Indigenous people, we will start at the end. Which is to say, we'll start from today and work backward.\n\nWhile there are currently no federally recognized tribes in Georgia, 2020 Census data tells us more than 214,000 self-identified Indigenous people reside here. Although the past few years have brought long-overdue visibility to Indigenous peoples around the world, Georgia very much remains an oft-forgotten part of our story.\n\nThe momentum of recent global racial justice movements combined with the local efforts to stop \"Cop City\" in Atlanta has led to more attention being paid to Indigenous issues in the region by teachers, nonprofits, city and state representatives, and others. This, in turn, opened up avenues for further conversation and growth, particularly surrounding the continued use of a racially based mascot by Atlanta's Major League Baseball team, the Braves .\n\nGeorgia's Native American population is as diverse as you might expect, and as Atlanta's metro area continues to grow and attract people from all over, tribal diversity in the area grows and expands as well.\n\nThe state does recognize three tribes: the Cherokee of Georgia Tribal Council, the Georgia Tribe of Eastern Cherokee, and the Lower Muscogee Creek Tribe. While many Native Americans are enrolled citizens of their tribes (regardless of federal recognition status), others are not, due to individual tribal restrictions on membership. Most tribal citizens can vote in their tribal elections even if they don't live on their reservation.\n\nNative Americans didn't become United States citizens until 1924, when President Calvin Coolidge signed the Indian Citizenship Act. His inspiration is often attributed to the high number of Native Americans who enlisted in the armed forces during World War I, and it would still be some time before Natives gained full civil rights via the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968.\n\nAlmost 100 years earlier, in 1834, four years after President Andrew Jackson successfully passed the Indian Removal Act, the forced removal of Creek citizens began in Georgia, with the removal of the Cherokee beginning in 1838. In the end, more than 60,000 people would be forced from their homes in the Southeastern United States.\n\nJust before President Jackson's congressional success, in 1828, the General Council of the Cherokee Nation established a printing press in New Echota, Georgia. The Cherokee Phoenix , published in both Cherokee and English, was the first Native American newspaper in the country.\n\nThe land that now makes up the state of Georgia is itself a reflection of the rich history and cultural legacy of the area's Original Peoples. From mound complexes such as Ocmulgee and Etowah to other sites scattered across the state, these locations provide insight into the lives, beliefs, and traditions of the Indigenous peoples who have lived here for thousands of years.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts.

At the Tribal Border Summit , an annual gathering of Indigenous communities hailing from all corners of the Western Hemisphere, from the tip of the Northwest Arctic to the Rio Grande, representatives of North America's Native communities discussed how to move freely in a world of borders. And although they are pressing their respective state governments for reforms to how borders are policed by national authorities, their larger vision seeks to carve out new legal avenues and territorial rights from some of the world's most unforgiving border regimes. The summit, which was hosted by the, Pascua Yaqui Tribe, the Tohono O'odham Nation and the National Congress of American Indians in Tucson in late January, focused the impacts of border security on traditional border-crossing rights, which has been a core part of family life and ancestral cultural and religious practices. The nations and tribes represented at the summit are situated astride all US borders-not only the southwestern edge but also Canada to the north, and Russia, along the Alaska Peninsula. Roughly 40 tribes' territories today straddle the border directly, but many Indigenous communities have traditions of crossing borders freely, with members in age-old settlements that fan out across modern legal boundaries. It was at this nexus of ancient tradition and progressive migration politics that the summit cultivated an unconventional conversation about social and cultural rights beyond borders. The gathering was not a radical intervention; rather, it was a transnational civic forum aimed at developing democratic, practical solutions to the need to maintain the cultural integrity of sovereign Indigenous communities. Climate Crisis Naomi Klein: The Green New Deal Is Changing the Calculus of the Possible Jon Wiener The obsession with Trump's \"wall\" in Washington also seeped into the summit's discussions. Tribal members have criticized the White House plans to construct the border barrier, reflecting the stance of a National Congress of American Indians (NCAI) resolution opposing the unilateral imposition of a wall without tribes' consent. Such a move, according to the resolution, would threaten territorial rights, \"further divide historic tribal lands and communities,\" \"militarize the lands on the southern boundary,\" and \"disturb or destroy tribal archeological, sacred sites, and human remains.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer Want to Understand the New Cold War?

An unprecedented September 2017 meeting between immigrant advocates and tribal representatives in Washington, DC, focused on the humanitarian implications of physical border barriers and \"preserving our respective languages, histories, stories and songs as the wellspring of our cultural identities.\" But the summit was more about the dignity of the borderlands' first inhabitants than about the direct harms wrought by border policies today. The central issue is Native people's \"underlying desire to facilitate border crossing,\" says Bailey Wood, a spokesperson for the summit. He observes that \"border crossings at all the borders have gotten much, much, much more stringent [for tribal members] over the past 10 or 15 years.\" Current Issue View our current issue The summit, in collaboration with NCAI, laid out several key demands to support border-crossing rights and related social and cultural protections. The 25 participating tribes called for a streamlined system of identification for transborder Native communities, as well as firmer guidelines for border patrol to prevent mistreatment of people and sensitive sites. Indigenous nations also determine their own policies on border crossings by migrants, pointedly asserting their independence from federal policies. The cultural friction at the southern border has only been aggravated by the heightened security tensions in the region. Representatives at the summit cited periodic conflicts with Homeland Security, including the \"unwillingness of border agents to accept tribal government-issued identification documents, excessive interrogation and harassment, denial of entry for minor offenses, and the improper handling of sacred or cultural items.\" Wood pointed out that for many tribal elders, \"their native tongue is their only language, so it's important to have translators at the border that can ask the right questions in the right way.\" Edward Manuel, of the Tohono O'odham Nation (which straddles the border between the United States and Mexico), recalled an incident in which \"a sacred ceremonial deer mask [was] forcefully ripped apart\" when border agents tried to \"search\" the item as if it were contraband. The issue of border securitization is also leading to ecological crisis. While a wall would be the most extreme environmental assault on the landscape, the southwestern-border region has already been deeply degraded by habitat loss and human encroachment. The NCAI resolution stressed the ecological threat of artificial barriers that could, on top of inhibiting human travel, also \"prevent wildlife from conducting migrations essential for survival and general life, health and existence.\" In the long term, Indigenous nations are seeking a comprehensive framework to cover sovereign rights that do not align with arbitrarily drawn nation-state borders. Plans are underway to develop a tribal crossing card to streamline legal passage for members-the qualifications for such a card would be determined by tribes themselves, in contrast to the federal government's antiquated, draconian \"blood quantum\" rules for tribal identification. For Francisco Valencia, a Council Member of the Pascua Yaqui nation, tribal sovereignty and territorial integrity-interlinked across US and Mexican lands-are inseparable. At a press briefing, he described the need to \"defend our inherent right to mobility\": \"Like many Native Americans across the Americas, the Pascua Yaqui people were nomads in a world with no borders, traveling the seasons following the hunt and carrying our tradition and culture by word of mouth. The stories of our people are passed down from generation to generation.... Members of our tribes must have access to one another. Anything short of that stifles our religious freedom and [undermines] our sovereignty.\" As the elder generation passes on, Valencia noted, \"To foster the next generation of elders, young people must learn from both sides. We must not let cultural transfers be impeded by borders.\" Under Trump, the crude Beltway politics of the border have been politicized and contested primarily in the realm of the Capitol and White House. But this year's tribal summit showed how the border continues to shape the lived experience of many communities that are struggling to preserve faith, family, and culture the way that they always have for centuries, indivisible by ideology, time, or geography.\n\nAt the Tribal Border Summit , an annual gathering of Indigenous communities hailing from all corners of the Western Hemisphere, from the tip of the Northwest Arctic to the Rio Grande, representatives of North America's Native communities discussed how to move freely in a world of borders.

An unprecedented September 2017 meeting between immigrant advocates and tribal representatives in Washington, DC, focused on the humanitarian implications of physical border barriers and \"preserving our respective languages, histories, stories and songs as the wellspring of our cultural identities.\" But the summit was more about the dignity of the borderlands' first inhabitants than about the direct harms wrought by border policies today. The central issue is Native people's \"underlying desire to facilitate border crossing,\" says Bailey Wood, a spokesperson for the summit. He observes that \"border crossings at all the borders have gotten much, much, much more stringent [for tribal members] over the past 10 or 15 years.\" Current Issue View our current issue The summit, in collaboration with NCAI, laid out several key demands to support border-crossing rights and related social and cultural protections. The 25 participating tribes called for a streamlined system of identification for transborder Native communities, as well as firmer guidelines for border patrol to prevent mistreatment of people and sensitive sites. Indigenous nations also determine their own policies on border crossings by migrants, pointedly asserting their independence from federal policies. The cultural friction at the southern border has only been aggravated by the heightened security tensions in the region. Representatives at the summit cited periodic conflicts with Homeland Security, including the \"unwillingness of border agents to accept tribal government-issued identification documents, excessive interrogation and harassment, denial of entry for minor offenses, and the improper handling of sacred or cultural items.\" Wood pointed out that for many tribal elders, \"their native tongue is their only language, so it's important to have translators at the border that can ask the right questions in the right way.\" Edward Manuel, of the Tohono O'odham Nation (which straddles the border between the United States and Mexico), recalled an incident in which \"a sacred ceremonial deer mask [was] forcefully ripped apart\" when border agents tried to \"search\" the item as if it were contraband. The issue of border securitization is also leading to ecological crisis. While a wall would be the most extreme environmental assault on the landscape, the southwestern-border region has already been deeply degraded by habitat loss and human encroachment. The NCAI resolution stressed the ecological threat of artificial barriers that could, on top of inhibiting human travel, also \"prevent wildlife from conducting migrations essential for survival and general life, health and existence.\" In the long term, Indigenous nations are seeking a comprehensive framework to cover sovereign rights that do not align with arbitrarily drawn nation-state borders. Plans are underway to develop a tribal crossing card to streamline legal passage for members-the qualifications for such a card would be determined by tribes themselves, in contrast to the federal government's antiquated, draconian \"blood quantum\" rules for tribal identification. For Francisco Valencia, a Council Member of the Pascua Yaqui nation, tribal sovereignty and territorial integrity-interlinked across US and Mexican lands-are inseparable. At a press briefing, he described the need to \"defend our inherent right to mobility\": \"Like many Native Americans across the Americas, the Pascua Yaqui people were nomads in a world with no borders, traveling the seasons following the hunt and carrying our tradition and culture by word of mouth. The stories of our people are passed down from generation to generation.... Members of our tribes must have access to one another. Anything short of that stifles our religious freedom and [undermines] our sovereignty.\" As the elder generation passes on, Valencia noted, \"To foster the next generation of elders, young people must learn from both sides. We must not let cultural transfers be impeded by borders.\" Under Trump, the crude Beltway politics of the border have been politicized and contested primarily in the realm of the Capitol and White House. But this year's tribal summit showed how the border continues to shape the lived experience of many communities that are struggling to preserve faith, family, and culture the way that they always have for centuries, indivisible by ideology, time, or geography.\n\nThe summit, which was hosted by the, Pascua Yaqui Tribe, the Tohono O'odham Nation and the National Congress of American Indians in Tucson in late January, focused the impacts of border security on traditional border-crossing rights, which has been a core part of family life and ancestral cultural and religious practices. The nations and tribes represented at the summit are situated astride all US borders-not only the southwestern edge but also Canada to the north, and Russia, along the Alaska Peninsula. Roughly 40 tribes' territories today straddle the border directly, but many Indigenous communities have traditions of crossing borders freely, with members in age-old settlements that fan out across modern legal boundaries. It was at this nexus of ancient tradition and progressive migration politics that the summit cultivated an unconventional conversation about social and cultural rights beyond borders. The gathering was not a radical intervention; rather, it was a transnational civic forum aimed at developing democratic, practical solutions to the need to maintain the cultural integrity of sovereign Indigenous communities.

Ms. Black Lance rushed her son back to the hospital in western South Dakota, where the doctors said they did not have the capacity to treat him and transferred him to a private hospital in Rapid City. There he was given a diagnosis of a life-threatening case of respiratory syncytial virus.\n\n\"They told me if I hadn't brought him back in, he would have died,\" Ms. Black Lance said, choking back tears.\n\nJames was lucky to have survived that day in April 2016. The problems at Sioux San, one of 24 hospitals nationwide run by the Indian Health Service , an arm of the Department of Health and Human Services, are pervasive: Five government investigations have found that patients have died at Sioux San from inadequate care, are often given wrong diagnoses and are treated by staff members who have not been screened for hepatitis and tuberculosis.\n\nThe troubles were so severe that Sioux San's emergency room and inpatient unit were shut down by the Indian Health Service and Congress in 2017. Only an urgent care clinic, often understaffed, remained open.\n\nSioux San is emblematic of the scale of the problems facing the Indian Health Service, which provides government medical care to 2.2 million of the nation's 3.7 million American Indians and Alaska Natives and is widely judged to provide substandard care.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

It has roughly the same population as Cortez, and it is surrounded by the same sandstone and mesa-filled terrain .

Indeed, Native American women helped to make 2018 the Year of the Woman. In November, New Mexican and Kansan voters elected Debra Haaland (Laguna Pueblo) and Sharice Davids (Ho-Chunk) to Congress, while voters in Minnesota elected Peggy Flanagan (Ojibwe) their lieutenant governor. In October, the sociologist Rebecca Sandefur (Chickasaw) and the poet Natalie Diaz (Mojave) won MacArthur Foundation Awards, while throughout the spring and summer, the playwrights Mary Kathryn Nagle (Cherokee), Larissa FastHorse (Lakota) and DeLanna Studi (Cherokee) had historic openings at Arena Stage in Washington, D.C., Artists Repertory Theater in Portland, Ore., and Portland Center Stage, respectively. From the cover of American Theater magazine in April to CNN on election night, the work of these eight dynamic Native women garnered national acclaim.\n\nSuch achievements represent more than added texture to the mosaic of modern America. They underscore the rising power of American Indians over the past two generations. During an era known as \"Self-Determination,\" Indian tribes and their citizens have changed not only their particular nations but also the larger nation around them. Though still poorly understood, this era emerged from urban and reservation activism in the 1960s and '70s, when community leaders, students and veterans, among others, challenged onerous policies that had aimed to assimilate tribal communities. The Self-Determination Era has now grown in prodigious ways and yielded countless examples of achievement across Native North America, including the elections of Haaland and Davids as the first American Indian women ever elected to Congress.\n\n\"The Heartbeat of Wounded Knee,\" by David Treuer (Ojibwe), examines these recent generations of American Indian history. Through memoir, interviews and extensive reading, Treuer counters the familiar narratives of invisibility that have so readily frozen America's indigenous peoples. Interweaving stories from family members, the voices of policymakers and assessments of contemporary youth culture, the book introduces alternative visions of American history. The result is an informed, moving and kaleidoscopic portrait of \"Indian survival, resilience, adaptability, pride and place in modern life.\" Rarely has a single volume in Native American history attempted such comprehensiveness.\n\nA noted novelist, Treuer takes his title from the celebrated work \"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee,\" by Dee Brown . Published in 1970 at the height of the activist movements, Brown's reassessment of the 19th-century wars between Indians and the federal government resonated with a generation of Americans. Achieving its narrative crescendo with the Wounded Knee Massacre of 1890, when the Seventh Cavalry was said to have exacted revenge for Custer's defeat at the Little Big Horn, Brown's text fueled growing outrage against injustices perpetuated by the federal government. It was a history that reached beyond its subject and helped to define an era. It has remained in print ever since.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Putting food on the table? Less so.\n\nGetting to food has long been a challenge for Pine Ridge residents. For a lot of people, the nearest grocery store is a two-hour drive away. Many rely on food stamps or the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations , a federal initiative that provides boxes of food (historically lacking in healthy options ) to low-income families. Diabetes rates run very high.\n\nThe coronavirus crisis - one case has been reported on the reservation - has only made access to food harder, as shelves of the few groceries empty out, shipments of food boxes are delayed because of supply chain disruptions, and hunting and gathering are restricted by government regulations and environmental conditions.\n\nBut the Oglala Sioux, like many other Native Americans across the country, are relying on the practices - seed saving, canning, dehydrating - that their forebears developed to survive harsh conditions, with limited supplies.\n\n\"It is kind of a Catch-22 to be so well-adjusted to react to threats,\" said Jamie Azure, the tribal chairman of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa , in Belcourt, N.D. \"You're forced to stay in a specific area, you're told to trust the government, you're told food will be scarce - welcome to 1700s Native nation.\"\n\nBig-box stores and processed foods have eroded some of the old customs.

When that's the case, one leader said, \"tribal nations have an effective death sentence.\"\n\nBy Kate Conger Robert Gebeloff and Richard A. Oppel Jr.\n\nHARRAH, Wash. - As the coronavirus outbreak in Washington State's Yakima County worsened last month, Tashina Nunez recognized more and more of the patients who arrived in her hospital. They had coughs, fevers and, in some severe cases, respiratory failure. And many of them were her acquaintances and neighbors, members of the tribes that make up the Yakama Nation.\n\nMs. Nunez, a nurse at a hospital in Yakima County and a Yakama Nation descendant, noticed that Native Americans, who make up about 7 percent of the county's population, seemed to account for many of the hospital's virus patients. Because the hospital does not routinely record race and ethnicity data, she said, it was hard for Ms. Nunez to know for certain.\n\n\"Not being counted is not new to us,\" she said. Without firm figures, she and other health care providers for Native communities said they struggled to know where or how to intervene to stop the spread. \"You don't know how bad it is until it's too late,\" Ms. Nunez said.\n\nBy mid-July, more than 650 members of the Yakama Nation, in central Washington State, had contracted the virus - about 6 percent of the total membership. Twenty-eight people have died, Delano Saluskin, chairman of the Yakama Nation, said in a video update .\n\n\"We all grieve those losses,\" he said. \"This has been devastating for many families on the reservation and it means that, every week, a family member is impacted.\"\n\nCounties with large Native American populations with reported infection rates above 1,500 cases per 100,000 residents.\n\nWash.\n\nYakima\n\nS.D.\n\nBuffalo\n\nThurston\n\nIowa\n\nNeb.\n\nUtah\n\nSan Juan\n\nSan Juan\n\nCoconino\n\nN.C.\n\nRobeson\n\nApache\n\nAriz.\n\nOkla.\n\nMcKinley\n\nLa Paz\n\nNavajo\n\nN.M.\n\nMaricopa\n\nMiss.\n\nMcCurtain\n\nPinal\n\nNeshoba\n\nWash.\n\nYakima\n\nS.D.\n\nBuffalo\n\nLyman\n\nThurston\n\nNeb.\n\nUtah\n\nD.C.\n\nSan Juan\n\nSan Juan\n\nCoconino\n\nN.C.\n\nAriz.\n\nRobeson\n\nMcKinley\n\nApache\n\nOkla.\n\nLa Paz\n\nN.M.\n\nNavajo\n\nMiss.\n\nMaricopa\n\nPinal\n\nNeshoba\n\nMcCurtain\n\nLa.\n\nTerrebonne\n\nYakima\n\nBuffalo\n\nLyman\n\nThurston\n\nApache\n\nSan Juan\n\nSan Juan\n\nRobeson\n\nCoconino\n\nMcCurtain\n\nMcKinley\n\nLa Paz\n\nNavajo\n\nNeshoba\n\nMaricopa\n\nPinal\n\nTerrebonne\n\nBy Scott Reinhard | Source: Times database of coronavirus cases compiled from state and local health agencies as of July 24.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Instead, he asserts that \"American Indians were central to every century of U.S. historical development.\"\n\nMore boldly still, he insists that \"Indigenous dispossession facilitated the growth of white male democracy and African American slavery\" to constitute America's historical trifecta of flaws. Built to serve and expand a settler society, the United States limited full citizenship to white men; helped them start new farms on lands taken from Indians; and protected their property rights, including their possession of enslaved people.\n\nDespite this promising premise, \"The Rediscovery of America\" gets off to a slow start by belaboring a straw man: \"historians\" who have neglected the American Indian past because they have been in thrall to \"tropes of discovery\" and notions of \"the superiority of Europeans\" that \"have bred exclusion and misunderstanding.\" Who are these bad historians? Blackhawk's introduction identifies only two, one of them dead.\n\nIn fact, this book benefits from Blackhawk's wide and savvy reading of the many scholars who, during the last 50 years, have restored Native peoples to their prominent place within a fuller, richer American history. Yes, we still have a triumphalist story of white settlers overcoming a wilderness filled with Indians to make democracy, but that tale persists almost entirely in popular culture and among right-wing corners of politics and the internet, far from academic historians.\n\nIn the early chapters Blackhawk's book lacks cohesion and flow, looping back and forth in time with much repetition as he considers the first three centuries after Columbus. Here he tells a now familiar story: Claiming religious and cultural superiority, European invaders slaughtered many Native peoples and dispossessed them of their land. The conquerors had help from devastating epidemics, which during the colonial era reduced Native populations by nearly 90 percent.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "Film Club: 'A Conversation With Native Americans on Race'\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nIn this short film, Native Americans share their experiences with race in the United States.\n\ntranscript\n\nI'm Apache, but really that's the government's name, because they can't say \"Dził Łigai N'dee.\" They will tell me how awesome they think it is that I've decided to be a part of my culture. And it's funny to me. It hits me really weird, and I don't like it. And I didn't know why at first, but it's because I haven't decided to be a part of my culture. I live it every day. I'm more comfortable with the term \"native,\" divorced from \"Native American.\" I know there are people who use \"indigenous.\" If there is one term I do not like to be called, it is \"American Indian.\" And for me, to be indigenous is to have an intimate and interconnected relationship to a homeland. And so that's really important, because land is, you know, tied to every aspect of who we are. Being native in a city is almost a daily reminder of your people's erasure. Of the fact that people don't even remember that you're here and that you exist. But what I did encounter was just this preconceived notion that all Native Americans are dead. I've had older white men come up to me and say, \"Oh, man, if this was 40 years ago, I could just do whatever I wanted to you.\" You know, the cattle outside doing the work and the dog inside the house, those are property. Those are the black folks in America. They are property to white men. Then the exotic antelope on the wall or the exotic - that's how natives are perceived in America. We're treated like animals. They monitor our blood quantum. I mean, besides dogs and horses, I don't know of any other animal that they monitor the blood quantum. The way I explain it to people is, imagine a pizza with different slices, and let's say 32 slices. Of the 32 slices, I'm 28 Apache. That's my particular blood quantum. And Native Americans in the U.S. are the only minority group who have to prove their nativeness on an Indian card. It's used to divide native people against each other, because it can be used as a way to say, I am more native than you. And I was a part of that, too. I used my 4 fourths to kind of make myself feel better against other people. The one drop rule, meaning that one drop of black blood makes you black, that was to keep as many people oppressed or legitimize their oppression as possible. But on the other side, one drop of anything else completely dilutes you as a native person. So if you're a native person, you have the one drop of something else, then suddenly you're less native. So it's the opposite. Traditionally, within the Apache society, you go by the mother. And if the mother is recognized as Apache, she has her clan, the children are unquestionably Apache. Not in the American context, not when patriarchy trumps matriarchy. So what does that mean? My sisters are short 1/16 of a degree. What does that mean? Does it mean their pinkies aren't Apache? What does that mean? You know, being a mixed race person is a whole other side of it, but that's a very common experience in our tribe. So it's not as if we're unusual in that way. What is unusual is the admixture of black. My grandfather actually doesn't want people - if he hears that somebody from the tribe is coming over, he won't come out of his room. Because he doesn't want them to know that he's that complexion, that he doesn't - I guess he doesn't want me to be affiliated with having African-American blood. But I mean, I say it. It's not going to change anything. If it were up to the American government, natives wouldn't be around. Because after a certain time, that blood will dilute. It will go out. And so if there's no native peoples to provide benefits, then we're not obligated to meet these treaty rights. And if we're not obligated to meet these treaty contracts, then the land is available, the resources are available. And I think that that essential point about our claim to sovereignty, our claim to land, our claim to a culture, our claim to resources is one that gets lost if we don't insist upon the fact that we are nations. And we have taken huge steps to decolonizing, and that proof comes from people being able to have the opportunities to speak their language, to be on their ancestral land. But the thing with decolonization is that it's an ongoing process, just like grieving, just like any loss. As much as possible now, I try to tell people that I have a Native American name, and maybe it doesn't mean anything to you, but it means everything to me. My name, maybe, doesn't have a romanticized, Hollywood Indian name, but my name has more meaning than that. My name means that my family survived. My family survived disease. My family survived Catholicism. My family survived settler colonialism, and my family, they survived. I survived. My existence is resistance. Me saying my name is Skiumtalx, that is resistance in and of itself.\n\nBy The Learning Network\n\n\" A Conversation With Native Americans on Race \" is a seven-minute film from 2017 that touches on themes of history, culture and identity.

      "text": "Do We Have the History of Native Americans Backward?\n\nI remember when I first encountered what must be the best-selling book of Native American history ever published, \" Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee ,\" by Dee Brown. I was twenty years old, and had made my way from the Leech Lake Reservation, in northern Minnesota, where I grew up, to Princeton, in a part of New Jersey that seemed to have no Indians at all. Since \"Bury My Heart\" appeared, in 1970, it has been translated into seventeen languages, and sold millions of copies. In the opening pages, Brown wrote, \"The greatest concentration of recorded experience and observation came out of the thirty-year span between 1860 and 1890-the period covered by this book. It was an incredible era of violence, greed, audacity, sentimentality, undirected exuberance, and an almost reverential attitude toward the ideal of personal freedom for those who already had it. During that time the culture and civilization of the American Indian was destroyed.\"\n\nI read this on the hundredth anniversary of the 1890 massacre at Wounded Knee Creek, in South Dakota. It was the last major armed conflict between an Indian tribe and the U.S. government, and more than two hundred and fifty Lakota men, women, and children were murdered there. Far from my Ojibwe homeland-marooned, I sometimes felt, on the distant shore of a self-satisfied republic-I readily accepted the version of history promoted by Brown's book: that Native American history was a litany of abuses (disease, slavery, warfare, dispossession, forced removal, the near-extermination of the American bison, land grabs, forced assimilation) that had erased our way of life. And yet my culture and civilization didn't feel gone. When I looked westward and back in time, I couldn't help think that Brown's historical record was incomplete-that the announcement of our collective death was rather premature.\n\nPekka Hämäläinen's \" Indigenous Continent \" (Liveright) boldly sets out a counternarrative. In its opening pages, Hämäläinen-a Helsinki-born scholar at Oxford who specializes in early and Indigenous American history-maintains that the America we know was, in its borders, shape, and culture, far from inevitable. Even after the so-called colonial era, tribal nations often played a determining role in American history. In his view, we should speak not of \"colonial America\" but of \"an Indigenous America that was only slowly and unevenly becoming colonial,\" and recognize that the central reality of the period was ongoing Indigenous resistance. By 1776, he notes, European powers had claimed most of the continent, but Indigenous people continued to control it. Instead of a foreordained story of decline and victimization, Hämäläinen wants us to see a parade of contingencies, with Native nations regularly giving as good as they got, or even better. The result, he promises, will be a North American history recentered on Native people and their own \"overwhelming and persisting\" power. Like treaties, though, scholarly promises have often been broken. Is Hämäläinen true to his word?\n\nDiscover notable new fiction, nonfiction, and poetry.\n\nThroughout the roughly chronological work, Hämäläinen stresses movement. Tribal travellers crossed the Bering land bridge during the last Ice Age, and then, around 11,000 B.C.E., traversed an ice-free corridor along the flank of the Rocky Mountains, following game and evolving, culturally, as they went. Hämäläinen notes that other migration waves may have moved, in skin boats, through a maritime route, a seafood-rich \"kelp highway,\" that traced the Pacific Coast from Alaska to Patagonia. However settlement occurred, it happened quickly.\n\nHämäläinen spends the opening pages of the book detailing the rise and fall of early empires, in the Southwest and the Midwest in particular. \"A distinctive pattern of simultaneous centralization and decentralization,\" he says, characterized Indigenous history in the early second millennium C.E. Regional centers of power emerged; subordinate groups would rebel or break off and sometimes create their own centers of power. Some of these societies were highly stratified and hierarchical, with élites and, in certain cases, a kinglike single ruler. Such societies led to the development of Mogollon, Hohokam, and Ancestral Puebloan cultures in the Southwest. An ecological warm period, combined with new food technologies (the breeding and cultivation of corn, beans, and squash), helped give rise to the city of Cahokia, where the Mississippi and the Missouri Rivers joined-the site of present-day St. Louis. Cahokia grew in population and size and had hundreds of ceremonial structures in the form of earthen mounds and plazas. At its peak, in the tenth and eleventh centuries, about forty thousand people lived in the vicinity. (It took seven centuries before North America saw a more populous city: Philadelphia, in 1790.)\n\nBut political culture was affected by climate. As temperatures dropped during the Little Ice Age, in the fourteenth century, Hämäläinen writes, \"everything had to be smaller.\" Cahokia's society fractured into more mobile, less hierarchical groups, with hunting replacing farming as the dominant mode of living, and something similar happened in other dense Mississippian settlements. \"Across the eastern half of the continent, people seem to have rejected the domineering priestly class for more collective and egalitarian social arrangements,\" he concludes.\n\nHämäläinen's broader point is that, long before the Europeans arrived, the peoples of the New World didn't inhabit the stasis of an ethnographer's account; they experienced a tumultuous process of continual change, which is to say, they were social and political actors. By the sixteenth century, around five million Native people had inhabited or made use of almost every part of North America. The usual story depicts them as dwelling in harmony with one another and the natural world in some cultural and ecological Eden that was then torn apart by Europeans. In fact, as Hämäläinen shows, they manipulated nature-rerouting water to create gardens in the desert, domesticating cultivars through seed selection-and they projected power, sometimes in violent ways, subordinating or being subordinated to their neighbors. They didn't live in harmony; they lived in history.\n\nJust as the initial settlement of the New World was marked by movement, so, too, were Indigenous forms of domination. It's a thesis that Hämäläinen elaborated in an influential previous book, \" The Comanche Empire \" (2008): where European empires tended to be sedentary, marking power through permanent structures, dominant Native ones were \"kinetic empires,\" with everything-markets, missions, political assemblies-kept fluid and in motion. From the perspective of their neighbors, who were subject to their opportunistic, long-distance raids, the Comanches were, he noted, \"everywhere and nowhere.\"\n\nThe same kinetic strategy often characterized the Native response to European invasion and settlement-the early Spanish attempts to colonize Florida and the American Southwest, the English efforts to gain a foothold on the East Coast, followed by the French in the north and mid-continent, and the Dutch efforts around New York and the Hudson Valley. Hämäläinen wants us to see these colonial forays from a Native perspective, and to focus on how tribal nations retained their ascendancy.\n\nWhen Hernando de Soto explored Florida and regions to the north, Hämäläinen recounts, he ventured into the territory of the Cofitachequi Nation, where he met its leader, known as the Lady of Cofitachequi, who was brought to the meeting on a litter. Perhaps sensing a chance to trade, she gave de Soto a pearl necklace; in response, he took her captive. The expedition moved on, in pursuit of even greater wealth. All this could sound like a story of colonial triumph, but Hämäläinen argues that we have it backward: \"Soto and other conquistadors believed they were conquering new lands for the Spanish Empire, but in reality, Indians were carefully steering the Europeans' course, sending them away with fantastical stories of treasures farther ahead.\" And that's a pattern that he regularly lays out: often, when European conquerors thought that they were subjugating tribal nations, the Europeans were actually being manipulated and controlled by them.\n\nAnd what looked like bold military successes frequently involved a misunderstanding of Indigenous political structures. In the American Southwest, conquistadors such as Juan de Oñate and Vicente de Zaldívar thought they were controlling the so-called Pueblo Empire by decapitating it, as had been done among the Incas and the Maya. Yet the Pueblo communities in the Southwest were a loosely allied network of autonomous towns, rather than a centrally organized kingdom. Massacres at places like Acoma-where, in 1599, the Spanish killed around eight hundred Pueblo in retaliation for the deaths of a dozen Spanish soldiers-didn't change the balance of power; they merely taught Indigenous people that the Spaniards were to be resisted. By the end of the sixteenth century, after nearly a hundred years of attempted conquests, Spain had failed to establish any serious settlements in North America.\n\nHämäläinen shows how the persistent power of Indigenous people similarly caused the early collapse of Jamestown. During the \"starving time\" of 1609-10, the English colonists-unable to hunt and unwilling to farm-ate dogs, cats, rats, horses, and, occasionally, one another. They failed to take the measure of the Powhatans, who had already subjugated a number of rival tribal nations. Now it was the ravaged colonists, Hämäläinen tells us, who were incorporated into Powhatan power structures. Of course, that wasn't the end of the story. In 1611, three English ships, bearing hundreds of soldiers, showed up; as Jamestown was reoccupied, the English burned Powhatan cornfields and slaughtered entire Native settlements. It sounds like a familiar story of colonial cruelty, and yet Hämäläinen offers a different emphasis: such massacres, he says, were the actions of terrified, isolated, weak, and ultimately unstable communities. In Hämäläinen's view, the colonial violence \"exposed a deep-rooted European anxiety over enduring Indigenous power: the attacks were so vicious because the colonists feared the Indians who refused to submit to their rule.\" He notes that into the mid-seventeenth century-a century and a half after Columbus-the coastal settlements established by the English, French, and Dutch colonists remained fragile and hemmed in; most of the continent was effectively off limits to them. The struggle was for survival more than for territorial expansion.\n\nOnly in the late seventeenth century did the French and the English begin to push into the heartland, engaging complex configurations of Indigenous power in contending for control of the Great Lakes and the Ohio River Valley. Yet even then colonial gains were precarious and provisional. By the mid-eighteenth century, Indian rebellions had rolled back European incursions; the Spanish, the French, and the English clung mainly to the coasts and rivers. The vast interior of the continent was largely unknown to them, and the tidy lines of the thirteen colonies were more aspirational than actual.\n\nAs the Europeans sought to entrench an imperial presence on the continent, many tribes conglomerated into lasting yet plastic empires of their own. The Iroquois Confederacy (made up of the Cayuga, the Seneca, the Mohawk, the Onondaga, the Oneida, and the Tuscarora) was the most significant power in the Northeast; the Three Fires Confederacy (Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi) was largely in control of the western Great Lakes; and, later, the Comanche on the southern Plains and the Lakota (along with the Nakota and the Dakota, who spoke distinct dialects of the same language) had military control of larger sections of the continent than any single European power did. Hämäläinen encourages us to see this time not as a period of colonial conquest but as a clash of empires, some European and some Indigenous.\n\nIndigenous foreign policy among the Iroquois and the Three Fires confederacies had evolved into a kind of kinetic détente. My ancestors kept the French and the British off balance by making and breaking alliances as necessary, preventing both from getting the upper hand and keeping both dependent on Native nations. One of the side effects of this policy was the Seven Years' War, which can plausibly be regarded as the first world war. The conflict began in what's now Ohio, where an Odawa-French war chief named Charles Langlade led a coalition of Odawa, Potawatomi, and Ojibwe soldiers against a British fort near Pickawillany. They killed thirteen Miami soldiers and took the British hostage. The attackers executed an English blacksmith, who had been wounded in the attack, and then boiled and ate his heart in front of the horrified garrison. Vignettes such as these make the point that tribal nations, including my own, were shoving Europeans around (and eating their hearts) for quite a long time, and help dislodge the idea that tribes were either passively doomed or ineffectually violent.\n\nIn time, the reasons for the clash of Indigenous and European empires began to change: the contest wasn't simply for resources and the ability to transport them but for land itself. As the colonies expanded, accordingly, the elimination of tribal nations became a goal. By the time of the American Revolution, the French had been almost entirely expelled from what is now the United States, and the British pushed into what is now Canada; the Spanish, meanwhile, had divested themselves of most of their holdings north of the Rio Grande through war, treaties, and trade. Yet many tribal nations remained, too strong to ignore or subdue. Thayendanegea, an Iroquois leader, warned President Washington's Secretary of War, \"You consider yourselves as independent people; we, as the original inhabitants of this country, and sovereigns of the soil, look upon ourselves as equally independent, and free as any other nation or nations.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the new American nation found itself crushed under war debt; individual former colonies had different needs and pursued different foreign policies. The government couldn't sustain multiple wars against multiple Indigenous groups. Instead, it deployed treaties and settlements as a means of subjugation. In the Ohio Country, Congress sold millions of acres of land it didn't own to coastal speculators, who in turn enticed settlers with large tracts for little money. \"The strategy was obvious: once the land was sold, colonists would eradicate Native Americans on their own,\" Hämäläinen writes.\n\nAll in all, between 1783 and 1803, fighting with tribes drained the U.S. Treasury and absorbed roughly eighty per cent of all federal spending. As a result, the government was forced to expand its authority over regional entities; new powers granted by the Indian Trade and Intercourse Act, in 1790, elbowed aside individual states when it came to the making of treaties and to the control of trade with tribal nations. It was in reaction to Native power and resistance that the augmented role of the federal government-the \"United\" part of the United States-arose.\n\nAs the U.S. grew through the nineteenth century, the balances of power once again shifted; spasms of violence ranged across the West and pitted the Comanche, the Apache, the Cheyenne, and the Lakota against one another and against the federal government. The United States drew on its increasing supply of bodies and of wealth to destroy, bypass, or enfold Native nations on its march to the Pacific. In the last few chapters of \"Indigenous Continent,\" Hämäläinen, whose book on the Comanche was followed by one on the Lakota, spends a fair amount of time on these two highly kinetic nations.\n\n\"Indigenous Continent\" itself has a kinetic quality; the account is magisterial but also frenzied, bringing in a plethora of instances in its effort to complicate the standard account. Hämäläinen is fond of the long-distance scholarly raid, and the book often proceeds at a gallop. Still, the pace and the scope of the book have a force of their own: Hämäläinen makes it clear that America's past is crazily, energetically, tumultuously crowded with incident; that Indigenous power has affected everything about America.\n\nHas he delivered on the idea of an \"Indigenous continent\"? That's a harder question. The great value of Hämäläinen's work is as a corrective polemic. In restoring historical agency to Native peoples, he joins a number of accomplished historians who over the past generation have advanced Native scholarship, including Richard White, Patricia Limerick, Ned Blackhawk, Michael McDonnell, Elizabeth Fenn, and others. The Native historian Joshua Reid has startlingly challenged the very \"bifurcation of Indian versus non-Indian colonists.\" Because we know how things turned out, the argument goes, we're tempted to fixate on the power struggles between European and Native groups while overlooking power struggles among Native peoples. The Lakota, for example, are intelligible only in relation to the Dakota and the Mandan and the Arikara and the Hidatsa as well as to the Ojibwe, the French, the English, and, later, the Americans. Similarly, the Iroquois come into focus only by way of their relationships with the Dutch, the English, the Wyandot, the Shawnee, the French, the English, and the Choctaw. Hämäläinen shows us, again and again, how various European and tribal nations ebbed and flowed not in isolation but in constant tension.\n\nAnd yet the limitations of Hämäläinen's approach are striking, too. Despite his avowed aim to tell the story of North America from an Indigenous perspective, the main history he relates largely follows the white settlers in their movements. We get conflict zones in the Appalachians, south of the Great Lakes, in the Ohio River Valley, and, later, on the Great Plains, but in each instance Hämäläinen replicates the very thing he has said he was writing against: a fundamentally east-to-west story of European colonial expansion. Nor is the purview of \"Indigenous Continent\" exactly continental. Hämäläinen spends hardly any time in the Pacific Northwest or along the California coast. We learn little about the alliances and conflicts between tribal nations and the Spanish which flowed from north to south along the Rio Grande, from what is now Colorado to Mexico City. We learn little, for that matter, about the alliances and conflicts that the Iroquois and the Three Fires confederacies had with the British and the French in what is now Canada, extending all the way north to Hudson Bay. What we get is less an \"Indigenous continent\" than a Native United States.\n\nThe book is, at times, breathless in its exposition, and nuance is sometimes lost in the shuffle. So, too, are the attempts to include Indigenous concepts-linguistic, spiritual, cultural. Scholars will debate whether the formation and expansion of certain tribal nations are best understood in reference to European models of empire. And Hämäläinen's eagerness to characterize the colonial slaughter of Indigenous people as evidence of fear and weakness wears thin as the tide turns, and the story of pitched battle gives way to one of systematic subjugation.\n\nThere is, of course, only so much that one book can do. As it is, the tremendous scope of \"Indigenous Continent\" exacts a narrative cost: often it reads like a monkish chronicle-a quick succession of names, dates, harvests, tragedies, schisms, rejoinings, subsequent sunderings, wins, losses. But, if Hämäläinen's achievements are more circumscribed than his ambitions, it's impossible not to honor both. I can only wish that, when I was that lonely college junior and was finishing \"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee,\" I'd had Hämäläinen's book at hand. It would have helped me see that there was indeed a larger story: that my civilization hadn't been destroyed; that my tribe's contribution to the past wasn't merely to fade away in the face of history; that Native peoples-for better or for worse-made this country what it was, and have a role to play in what it now struggles to be. ♦\n\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the time period when tribal travellers traversed an ice-free corridor along the flank of the Rocky Mountains.\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "A Professor Claimed to Be Native American. Did She Know She Wasn't?\n\nIn 1928, a forty-one-year-old woman named Adeline Ovitt, née Rivers, drowned in the Schroon River, in upstate New York. The circumstances of her death are largely unknown, but she left behind a husband and five children, including a ten-year-old son named LeRoy, who later had six children of his own, including a daughter named Anita. Anita eventually settled down with Robert Hoover, a pipe fitter for General Electric, in the town of Knox, about forty minutes west of Albany. In 1978, Anita and Robert had their first child together, a daughter named Elizabeth. Two more daughters would follow.\n\nElizabeth Hoover, who is now forty-five years old, describes her childhood as \"broke\"-her father worked odd construction jobs and was periodically unemployed-but idyllic. \"I spent most of my time running around outside,\" she told me recently. \"My dad said I could head anywhere as long as I took a dog, a walking stick, and a knife.\" Much of her youth was spent harvesting vegetables, butchering meat, and chopping wood for the winter.\n\nAs Hoover and her sisters grew older, they began to find a sense of purpose and identity in a story that Anita told them about their family. Their great-grandmother, she said, had been a Mohawk Indian, and she had drowned herself in order to escape her drunk and abusive French Canadian husband. The girls were also told that they were Mi'kmaq on their father's side. Anita began taking the girls to powwows across western New York and New England, where Native Americans would play music, share crafts, and dance. These gatherings are held throughout the country. They are intertribal and offer opportunities for Native Americans who have become disconnected from their people to be welcomed back in.\n\nTammy Bucchino met Hoover at a powwow in the early nineties. Bucchino's mother, a German woman, took Tammy to the powwows for the same reasons that Anita Hoover took Elizabeth: she wanted her child to feel a connection to her heritage. Bucchino's father was full-blood Mi'kmaq, but she wouldn't get to know him until later in life. \"We clicked because she said she's Mi'kmaq, like me,\" Bucchino said of Hoover. \"And she said she had Mohawk background, and my stepbrother has a Mohawk background as well.\"\n\nThe Bucchinos and the Hoovers began to spend frequent weekends together. Elizabeth and Tammy taught each other the intricacies of the Fancy Shawl Dance, which involves elaborate regalia. (The dance emerged in the twentieth century, and it became a way to preserve Native American culture.) At powwows, the girls picked up ways of thinking and speaking that distinguished them from their white classmates in school. \"Liz dances like her feet don't even touch the ground,\" Bucchino said. \"She's put her heart and soul into her own culture. Not many people do that.\"\n\nBy the time Hoover was a teen-ager, she had taken on a Mi'kmaq name, Gomdineôeôeu Ôsaog, which she translates as Mountain Flower. She says she was given that name by a Mi'kmaq elder at a ceremony attended by her paternal grandmother. In 1996, Parade magazine collected statements from high-school students about racism and offensive mascots. \"Being of Native American descent, I am annoyed at mascots like 'Indians' or 'Chiefs' or 'Braves'-and the mock war whoops and chanting that often accompany these names,\" Hoover is quoted as saying. The statement is signed \"Elizabeth Gomdineôeôeu Ôsaog Hoover, 17, Knox, N.Y.\"\n\nHoover was an exemplary student, and she enrolled at Williams College, in western Massachusetts, in 1997. She studied anthropology and psychology. As a sophomore, she organized a powwow that got a writeup in the student paper. The accompanying photo shows a nineteen-year-old Hoover, thin and tall, with dark-brown hair, close-set eyes, and two white feathers in her hair. She is described as \"Elizabeth Hoover '01, known as Wind Chaser and descendant of the Mohawk and Micmac tribes.\" (Hoover says she has never gone by Wind Chaser.) Her senior thesis was titled \"The Self-Identification of Mixed-Blood Indians in the United States and Canada.\"\n\nAfter graduation, Hoover went to Brown to pursue a Ph.D. in anthropology. A teaching appointment at Brown was followed by a tenured professorship at the University of California, Berkeley. By her early forties, Hoover had become one of the most successful Native American academics in the country, renowned for her work in food sovereignty, the idea that self-determination entails controlling one's sources of nutrition. On Instagram, she posted envy-inducing pictures with her partner, a Crow photographer named Adam Sings In The Timber: Hoover, dressed in Fancy Shawl Dance regalia of bright blue and white, a goofy smile on her face; Sings In The Timber, handsome and dressed in black, a camera slung around his neck.\n\nThen in October of 2022 Hoover published a statement on her Web site: \"As a result of recent questions about my identity, I, along with others, conducted genealogical research to verify the tribal descent that my family raised me with, digging through online databases, archival records, and census data.\" These searches, she explained, had turned up no evidence of Native American lineage. \"Essentially what I am currently left with is that I do not have any official documentation to verify the way my family has identified.\"\n\nSeveral months later, after this statement had been met with great skepticism and online furor, Hoover, in consultation with the Restorative Justice Center at Berkeley, published another statement: \"I am a white person who has incorrectly identified as Native my whole life, based on incomplete information.\"\n\nTo outsiders, the term \"Pretendian\" might sound ugly or be discomforting. There is no universal standard for determining who is a \"real\" Native American and who is not. Native identity is a legal and political classification, based on filial lineage and tribal citizenship. Tribal nations have their own rules for enrollment, and some are more open than others. The Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe, for example, requires twenty-five per cent Akwesasne Mohawk blood; the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma mandates that an ancestor be on its 1937 roll and have an eighth Pawnee blood. The Cherokee Nation, one of the two largest Native groups in the United States, will accept anyone who can prove some lineal descent in specific records.\n\nLink copied\n\nThese rules have been informed by brutal histories. Blood requirements can be traced to \"blood quantum\" laws, which, beginning in the Colonial era, were used to disenfranchise Native Americans and to enforce racial distinctions that controlled everything from land claims to marriages. But such criteria can now be a way of insuring that often scarce tribal resources are divided among actual descendants, and to discourage impostors from claiming identities that they don't possess.\n\nSuch fraud seems particularly rife in academia. In just the past few years, several scholars have been accused of being Pretendians, including Mary Ellen Turpel-Lafond, a former judge and law professor in Canada who has said that her father was Cree, and Qwo-Li Driskill, a professor of gender and queer studies at Oregon State University who claims to have Cherokee, Lenape, Lumbee, and Osage heritage. (Turpel-Lafond denied the accusation, in 2022; Driskill's attorney characterized the accusation against his client as intrusive and false.) Ward Churchill, one of the country's best-known Native-studies scholars, has been accused, throughout his career, of telling false stories about his Cherokee ancestry; when asked for proof of it, he claimed that such inquiries were the tools of colonialism. In January, 2023, Andrea Smith, a major figure in the field of ethnic studies, agreed to resign from the University of California, Riverside, effective this August, following questions about the veracity of her Cherokee heritage. (Both Churchill and Smith deny lying about their identities.)\n\nThere are likely many other cases. Kim TallBear, an enrolled member of the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate tribe and a professor of Native studies at the University of Alberta, guesses that a quarter of those who have checked the box for Native American in the academy are what she calls \"self-Indigenizers,\" people who either invent a Native heritage wholesale or play up a tenuous connection. \"Most of the cases haven't been made very public yet,\" TallBear said.\n\nThe word \"complicated\" always hovers in the stories of Pretendians. After centuries of colonization, displacement, and forceful assimilation, many Native Americans who grew up in their tribal communities can pass as white or as other races. People whose parents were adopted or sent to boarding schools as part of government programs to weaken tribal sovereignty may return to their communities, however removed they have since become. And a child may hear about some distant Native ancestor, then build an identity around what turns out to be a bit of family lore. There is a sympathetic-and, yes, complicated-version of Hoover's story in which a white woman named Anita is so moved by the tale of a grandmother's tragic death that she takes her daughters to powwows and encourages them to befriend Native kids.\n\nAnita Hoover brought up her daughters to care about being Native; not even Hoover's critics dispute that. Hoover, in her formal statements and in the conversations I had with her over the course of nine months, has repeatedly insisted that, until people began questioning her identity, she had never carefully researched her genealogy. She knew that she was not eligible for tribal enrollment, she says, and so she didn't bother. This explanation seems to take for granted that there was little else to be gained by knowing more about the specific people she came from. You might wonder if, at some point, she began to have her own suspicions and avoided getting to the bottom of them. Or you might believe that Hoover must have traced her family tree, found it wanting, and decided to keep going with a story that had given her the life she had-in which case, you will have to conclude not only that she lied in her two formal statements but that she lied for years about who she was.\n\nJennifer Weston first met Hoover around the time that Hoover began her graduate work at Brown. Weston, who is Hunkpapa Lakota and was born and grew up on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, had gone to Brown as an undergraduate, and she had recently returned to Providence to organize the small number of Native students on the campus. Hoover was with her boyfriend at the time, who is Wampanoag. They told Weston that they had connections to nearby tribes. \"I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life,\" Hoover told me. Her boyfriend worked in a museum. \"So I was, like, 'Well, I'll go get a degree in museum studies.' \"\n\nShe matriculated at Brown in 2001, shortly before the arrival of a professor named Evelyn Hu-DeHart, a historian whose family immigrated to the U.S. from China when she was a girl. Hu-DeHart studied Latin American and Caribbean history and wrote extensively, at the beginning of her academic career, on the Yaqui, a Native tribe with roots in northwest Mexico. She was hired to build up the school's ethnic-studies program, and to run the Center for the Study of Race and Ethnicity in America.\n\nEarly in her time at Brown, Hu-DeHart remembers noticing a striking young woman who wore beaded earrings and hung around with the kids in a Native American student group. Hoover \"figured out very early how to project her Native American identity,\" Hu-DeHart told me, noting that many Native people can pass for white. (\"They don't necessarily have physical features or even a skin color that immediately marks them,\" she said.) She added, of Hoover, \"At Brown, she organized an annual powwow. We brought in drums from the different tribes around. We had dancers, and Liz would always have a beautiful regalia, gowns, and beautiful beaded jewelry.\" The ethnic-studies department did not have a full-time Native American faculty member, a fact that weighed on Hu-DeHart. The university eventually began a job search for a Native-studies scholar. In the meantime, Hu-DeHart asked Hoover to serve as a graduate instructor for an introductory Native-studies course that Hu-DeHart planned to offer.\n\nIn Hoover's first few years at Brown, she and Jennifer Weston ran into each other often. Weston recalls Hoover saying that the Mohawk side of her family was from \"north of Kahnawà:ke,\" a territory in southern Quebec, and that she wasn't sure about her Mi'kmaq side. In the summer of 2005, Hoover took a trip to Kahnawà:ke to attend a powwow; afterward, in an e-mail, she reported running into \"people who knew people i'm related to so that was nice.\" She went on to explain that her family \"left kahnawake a few generations ago\" and had lived in New York ever since. (Hoover said that this connection fell through and that she never pursued it further.)\n\nA month later, Weston got married. Hoover offered to make her a pair of moccasins to go with a traditional buckskin dress. Although Hoover would later maintain that she never found her relatives, Weston insists that, at the wedding, Hoover told people that she had found them-and that, contrary to what she had believed before, they were actually from Kahnawà:ke proper. Weston remembers feeling a great deal of happiness for her friend.\n\nThe Akwesasne Mohawk reservation straddles the border between New York and Canada and sits along the St. Lawrence River, which, for generations, carried effluents from nearby industrial sites, contaminating everything from local food to breast milk.\n\nHoover began spending a lot of time on the reservation not long after she started her doctorate. Through mutual Ivy League acquaintances, she'd met the son of a scholar and midwife named Katsi Cook, who, in the nineteen-eighties, had conducted a groundbreaking study of industrial pollutants in breast milk. Cook's son introduced Hoover to his mother, who quickly saw a use for this young, eager student from Brown. Cook wanted someone to look through the health records of participants from her study and to follow up with them, in order to gather information for how future studies could be improved.\n\nHoover began travelling back and forth between Providence and Akwesasne. On the reservation, she helped out with farming projects and in the community library. At Cook's urging, she decided to write her dissertation about industrial pollution as well as gardening. The perception of reservation-wide contamination had made people at Akwesasne afraid to grow crops, an activity that was vital for their self-reliance. Within a year, Hoover had conducted sixty-three interviews, which, along with the records Cook had given her, provided much of the basis for her dissertation.\n\nIn the community garden, Hoover met Jean Laffin, who runs a small farm. Laffin doesn't recall Hoover ever explaining her background, but she always assumed that Hoover was Native. \"It was the way she spoke,\" Laffin said. \"She just blended right in with people here.\" She eventually took to calling Hoover her \"chosen daughter,\" and came to consider her part of the family.\n\nKahnawà:ke is about an hour and a half's drive from Akwesasne. Hoover had been there at least once, before Weston's wedding, and Katsi Cook's mother was from Kahnawà:ke. Given the close ties between the two Mohawk communities, Cook could easily have started Hoover on a path to finding her relatives, no matter how distant. So why didn't Hoover take the short drive in order to find them? And why didn't she ask Cook for help?\n\nAudra Simpson, an anthropology professor at Columbia and a member of the Mohawk Nation at Kahnawà:ke, met Hoover at a Native-studies conference before Hoover had embarked on her Akwesasne project. Simpson was there with a Mohawk curator and scholar. \"Liz Hoover approached us and introduced herself very enthusiastically,\" Simpson told me. \"She was quite friendly. And she said she was from Kahnawà:ke.\"\n\nSimpson began asking about Hoover's family, as she would any Native person with overlapping heritage. \"I'm looking to make a connection,\" Simpson explained to me. \"I'm looking to find out if we're related, because if you claim that you're from Kahnawà:ke then you're potentially related to me somehow. There's so few of us.\" Hoover gave her the name Brooks. Simpson thought she must have misheard. It wasn't a name she knew.\n\nOver the years, Simpson occasionally heard about Hoover and spoke with other academics who had noticed the vague way that Hoover talked about her ancestry. Simpson was also slightly suspicious of Hoover on account of the volume of beadwork and Native American signifiers that she was known to wear. (Hoover insists that this is exaggerated, but others described her in a similar fashion. \"It looked like an Etsy shop exploded on her,\" Simpson said.) On a visit to Kahnawà:ke, Simpson asked around to learn if there was a family named Brooks. There was. \"It's a tiny, tiny family,\" Simpson told me. \"There were two people still alive.\" She asked cousins of the family if Elizabeth Hoover was related to them. \"Nobody had ever heard of her,\" Simpson said. The next time she saw Hoover, at an American Anthropological Association event, she asked her a direct question: \"Who are you?\"\n\n\"I was not warm,\" Simpson recalled. \"She looked at me like a deer in the headlights and then she sort of scuttled away.\" (Hoover disputes this account.) Simpson has known people whose families were from Kahnawà:ke and who had become disconnected from their pasts. \"Some of us were forced to live off the reserve,\" she told me. \"Even the ones forced out, we still know them and claim them.\" Such stories were not new to Simpson. \"There are people who returned home, and maybe they don't feel one hundred per cent welcome, but they are brought back in,\" Simpson said. \"I don't think Elizabeth Hoover ever made that journey.\"\n\nHoover completed her dissertation in 2010. When Jennifer Weston read it, she noted a mention of Kahnawà:ke in Hoover's description of her background. She assumed that Hoover had successfully traced her family, but, when she asked her friend about it, Hoover said she still didn't have much information. \"I remember thinking that was weird,\" Weston told me. Hoover did say that she had learned who her family was. It wasn't the Brooks family. She was from the Rivers family, she said. She believed they had shortened the name from Two Rivers.\n\nBy 2012, Brown University's search for a Native-studies scholar had been going on for several years. Candidates were flown to Providence and asked to give \"job talks,\" during which the scholar meets students and presents research. Some candidates who were brought in dropped out voluntarily. Others were passed over.\n\nAnnette Rodriguez was a graduate fellow at the center toward the end of this period. She told me about a Native scholar who gave a job talk wearing a three-piece suit with a distinctively patterned tie. Someone asked him about the pattern, expecting that the design had come from his tribal community. The scholar said it was from Barneys. \"He wasn't going to fuel the fantasies of the white imagination of what an authentic Native person was,\" Rodriguez said. \"Liz was very happy to do that.\"\n\nHoover had returned to Brown as a visiting scholar in 2011, after another attempt to fill the full-time position had failed. The American-studies department, which had absorbed the ethnic-studies program, then decided to alter the job description, calling for a scholar earlier in her career, and quickly hired Hoover. Hu-DeHart was on leave at the time, but Rodriguez saw her hand in it. Hu-DeHart was Hoover's patron, Rodriguez said. It's common-arguably, even required-for young faculty to have champions in their departments. But such a prestigious job doesn't often appear so suddenly for an academic who has not yet published a book or had a tenure-track job elsewhere.\n\nLink copied\n\nRodriguez saw a connection between Hoover's swift rise and how ardently she signalled her supposed Native identity. \"I was never in a meeting where she wasn't beading,\" Rodriguez said. \"She had different beads in little plastic containers or bags, and she would take them out and start beading during our faculty meetings or when someone was giving a presentation.\"\n\nIn Rodriguez's view, Hoover was performing a kind of fantasy of the Native scholar for the non-Native faculty around her-she was what they wanted to see. \"She got grants, and she got fellowships, and she checked boxes, and she got positions,\" Rodriguez said. \"And so she exploited the system. But I think the system also was very happy to have her as the visible Native.\"\n\nIn 2016, thousands of people gathered at the Standing Rock reservation to block the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline. Weston, who had returned home to take part in the resistance, got a message from her old friend. Hoover was planning on coming to Standing Rock, and a group of students were getting money together so that they could join her. They wanted to get the lay of the land before coming and hoped that Weston could fill them in.\n\nThe students created a GoFundMe page for the trip. They also drafted a funding proposal, with Hoover's knowledge, that suggested they would bring back items to donate to a museum. This seemed to violate key tenets of Native studies: you should not extract from a community and you should respect the sovereignty of its people. Weston was baffled that Hoover would fail to grasp something so fundamental. She explained these concerns to Hoover, who acquiesced, and they remained on friendly terms. Weston sent Hoover slides to use at Brown chronicling the Lakota's treaties with the U.S. government and Standing Rock's history of resistance. After Hoover's dissertation was published as a book, \"The River Is in Us,\" in 2017, Weston helped organize a launch party at a bookstore in Providence.\n\nA short while later, the department of Environmental Science, Policy, and Management at Berkeley started a hiring search. The department was under some pressure to diversify the faculty after a Black professor was denied tenure. A handful of people in the department advocated for Hoover, including a professor named Kathryn De Master, who had met Hoover earlier in her career and was impressed by her work. Hoover got the job, and she and Adam Sings In The Timber moved to Berkeley in October, 2020. He was hired as a photographer for the university. Hoover connected with students over Zoom and began figuring out her niche in the sometimes dramatic and frequently petty forum of department politics.\n\nThat December, Joe Biden appointed Deb Haaland, a member of the Pueblo of Laguna, to lead the Department of the Interior. A writer named Claudia Lawrence, who identified as Native, wrote an Op-Ed in the Times offering Haaland advice. After the column ran, the Times was informed of a claim that Lawrence had no Native ancestry, and determined that Lawrence could not prove otherwise. (Lawrence could not be reached for comment.) In the wake of the dustup, a journalist named Jacqueline Keeler created the Alleged Pretendians List.\n\nKeeler had been on a campaign against Pretendians for several years. In 2015, she wrote a piece about the phenomenon for the Daily Beast, after Dartmouth, her alma mater, hired a woman named Susan Taffe Reed, the president of Eastern Delaware Nation, as the director of its Native American Program. The writers of an irreverent blog called FakeIndians had discovered that Eastern Delaware Nation was not a recognized tribe but a nonprofit, and that Taffe Reed did not appear to have Delaware tribal ancestry. (Taffe Reed did not respond to a request for comment.) Keeler began working with a team of scholars and genealogists to expose Pretendians, prompting bursts of attention in the press-most notably when she challenged the identity of Sacheen Littlefeather, the actress and activist who declined an Academy Award on behalf of Marlon Brando, in 1973, in an effort to protest Hollywood's portrayal of Native Americans.\n\nKeeler shared the Alleged Pretendians List with a select group of scholars and community members, who could contribute the names of people they believed were faking their heritage and add notes detailing whatever evidence they had. The list was quickly screenshotted, downloaded, and shared. The ancestries of some people on the list were ultimately verified and marked accordingly. But many people I spoke to expressed discomfort with Keeler's methods, saying that she assumes guilt, requiring the accused to prove themselves innocent. What's more, critics say, the campaign encourages cultural chauvinism-tribal strength and sovereignty depend on a community being able to determine whom to invite in, not on the watchful policing of sometimes arbitrary genetic boundaries.\n\nStill, even some of Keeler's sharpest critics say that she is, as one grad student put it to me, \"problematic but necessary.\" Prior to Keeler, Pretendians had cosplayed for years without any real repercussions. Kim TallBear, the professor of Native studies at the University of Alberta, supports Keeler's work unequivocally. \"Jackie being out front has opened a door that a lot of other people have walked through,\" she said. \"I am disgusted when people throw her under the bus.\"\n\nJennifer Weston sought out the list to see if anyone she knew was on it. Many of the names were unsurprising, the subjects of years of rumor. Then she saw Hoover's name. She got in touch with her, expressing surprise and confusion. \"When I asked her about it, she said that she was just going to keep doing her good work until they came for her,\" Weston told me. (Hoover disputes this account.) \"And now I'm wondering if that's one of the only true things she's ever said to me.\"\n\nEarly in 2022, accusations that Adam Sings In The Timber, Hoover's partner, was a sexual predator began circulating on social media. Soon, a Native organization, the Chi-Nations Youth Council, which had worked with him in the past, posted a statement denouncing him as \"a groomer and a rapist.\"\n\nOne of Sings In The Timber's accusers was a student and an aspiring photographer named Tena Bear Don't Walk. Bear Don't Walk, who is Crow, was eighteen when she first got to know Sings In The Timber. They began exchanging Instagram messages in 2018, and the following year Sings In The Timber, who was in his early forties, told her about a talk he was giving in Seattle. Bear Don't Walk met him and Hoover there.\n\nWhen Sings In The Timber made another visit to Washington State, months later, he met Bear Don't Walk for dinner. After dinner, he bought some alcohol, and they drank together in his hotel room. Then, while she was asleep, she says, he sexually assaulted her. Bear Don't Walk reported the alleged assault to the Tulalip Tribal Police Department three years later; after a brief investigation, the Tulalip prosecutor's office decided not to pursue the case. (Sings In The Timber did not respond to a request for comment. In an Instagram post, from 2022, he denied ever having nonconsensual sex with anyone.)\n\nAfter the allegations began circulating, Hoover privately defended her partner. She told an acquaintance, David Smoke-McCluskey, that the accusations had been \"completely made up,\" and that Sings In The Timber was working on a statement with a mediator and with \"the woman who fabricated\" the story. There would be a ceremony, she said, at which Bear Don't Walk would apologize for \"publicly slandering\" Sings In The Timber, and he would apologize \"for hurting her feelings.\" A Crow woman named Nina Sanders had, indeed, been approached about handling the situation in a Crow way, and had explained that this would involve a ceremony, but she claims she never proposed a joint apology or characterized the allegations as false. Hoover says the messages reflected her understanding of the situation at the time, but Smoke-McCluskey believes that Hoover lied to him in order to cast doubt on Bear Don't Walk's story.\n\nBear Don't Walk went public in April. Another young woman had posted a story about Sings In The Timber behaving inappropriately, and the allegations were written up in a couple of Native publications. Hoover posted a statement on Instagram, insisting that she was \"completely unaware of Adam's harmful interactions with the two women who have come forward, until everything came out on this very public forum.\" This is an overstatement at best: the mediation involving Sanders was proposed shortly after the accusations were made, in February. Hoover later deleted her Instagram account.\n\nAs this was going on, Hoover went to her colleague Kathryn De Master's house and broke down. De Master felt overwhelmed, she told me. She considered Hoover a friend and an ally-the two had ridden out much of the early days of the pandemic texting jokes back and forth during department Zoom calls. And all the attention had made the whispers about Hoover's identity harder to ignore. When people wrote about Sings In The Timber's alleged behavior, they generally noted that his partner's Native identity had been contested. This wasn't news to De Master, but, like many of Hoover's colleagues, she had wanted to believe Hoover, and so she did.\n\nPerhaps none of Hoover's colleagues were as upset about the rumors as Adrienne Keene, whom Hoover had mentored at Brown. Despite years of close friendship, Keene realized that Hoover had never told her the \"full story\" of her family. (Hoover denies keeping anything from her.) Keene reached out to Hoover and \"asked her directly for family names and ties,\" she later wrote, and \"was left confused and unsatisfied by the answers.\" She decided to investigate the matter herself, searching census records and reading through newspaper archives. Keene, who did not respond to several requests for an interview, has insisted that she began her investigation with the goal of helping her mentor by putting the questions to rest.\n\n\"I did this work from a place of love, which makes what I found even harder for me to understand,\" she wrote in a long e-mail to Hoover, in June, 2022. \"I wanted your story to be true. I wanted to give you the tools you needed to prove everyone wrong.\" The e-mail goes through several generations of Hoover's family tree, finding no ties to any Indigenous community. Keene later posted the e-mail on her blog.\n\nIn October of that year, Hoover published the first of her two statements about her identity. In response, three Native students who had studied with Hoover-Ataya Cesspooch, Sierra Edd, and Breylan Martin-wrote an open letter demanding her resignation. \"As scholars embedded in the kinship networks of our communities,\" they wrote, \"we find Hoover's repeated attempts to differentiate herself from settlers with similar stories and her claims of having lived experience as an Indigenous person by dancing at powwows absolutely appalling.\" Hoover, they went on, had \"failed to acknowledge the harm she has caused and enabled.\"\n\nThis question of harm-of whether and to what extent it has actually been done-is central to debates about racial fraud, particularly when the person accused has done good work in the community. With academics, harm is often, though not entirely, a matter of stolen opportunities. Martin told me about the difficulties she has had paying for her education, and about the necessity of fellowships and financial-aid opportunities aimed at Native students. Hoover had seized such opportunities her entire academic life, Martin said.\n\nEdd suggested that Hoover's lofty career was symptomatic of a larger identity problem within the academy. \"There's a prevalence of white people and white-passing people within ethnic cultural studies, whether you're talking about African American studies, Latino, Asian American, or Native American,\" she said. \"There is a centering of whiteness that is felt within the fields, within the academic discourse, but also within the institutions who hire the people who make up these departments.\"\n\nI heard versions of this point from several of Hoover's former students and colleagues. Hoover dressed the part, they said, but was also able to ingratiate herself with senior faculty-who may have subconsciously gravitated to someone who, behind the beads and the regalia, was just like them. \"People who either have a story of a Cherokee ancestor or maybe actually have one in 1820, but who code as white, and come from a middle- or upper-middle-class background, there's a certain kind of white privilege that opens doors for you,\" Kim TallBear told me. \"They're more comfortable for people.\"\n\nNearly four hundred people have signed the students' letter. Hoover's department asked the university's Restorative Justice Center to work with students who felt betrayed, and also with Hoover, to discuss the harm she'd caused. Hoover then released her second statement, titled \"Letter of Apology and Accountability.\" In it, she writes, \"I was first directly challenged in my Indigenous identity when I began my first assistant professor job.\" The word \"harm,\" and its variants, makes thirteen appearances. Hoover never says that she lied, but she refers multiple times to \"broken trust\" and insists that she is deeply sorry. \"I have put away my dance regalia, ribbons skirts, moccasins, and Native jewelry,\" she writes. \"I've begun to give away some of these things to people who will wear them better.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nReading this second statement, Kathryn De Master thought back to a visit she and a colleague had made to Hoover's house months before, to ask Hoover about her past. If De Master and others in the department were going to support Hoover, they needed to have a full accounting of the facts, and they needed to hear them from her. The three colleagues sat together on Hoover's porch. De Master asked Hoover if there had ever been questions about her Native heritage before she arrived at Berkeley, and Hoover emphatically said no. (Hoover denies saying no.)\n\nI first contacted Elizabeth Hoover in May, 2023, the day after she published her second statement. We met shortly afterward, in a coffee shop in Berkeley. Living in a college town, one meets more than one's share of academic narcissists, but Hoover didn't come across as that type. Her charm and intelligence were obvious. She spoke of the wreckage of her life with a dark, engaging humor.\n\nI told Hoover that others remembered her speaking of a connection to a family named Brooks, and then to the Rivers and Two Rivers families. If she had never researched her family, as she claimed, where did these names come from?\n\n\"I've had one story, which is the story that my mother gave me,\" Hoover insisted. \"My mom's grandma was Adelaide Rivers, and she was under the impression that it used to be Two Rivers and she shortened it.\" The Two Rivers family does in fact exist, though Hoover has no connection to it. She denies mentioning the name Brooks to anyone.\n\nI asked why she didn't enlist the help of Katsi Cook-who, despite all the allegations, still loves Hoover-in order to find her people in Kahnawà:ke. She reiterated her point about not meeting the criteria for enrollment. \"I know other people who have been rejected in this way,\" she said. \"There's not an ethos of 'Yes, please come home and reclaim.' People, when I would reach out, were prickly towards me.\" She added, \"I should have put myself out there. I should have just sucked it up.\"\n\nAt one point, Hoover suggested that she didn't investigate things further because the great-grandmother she'd heard about was not inspiring. \"When people are, like, 'Oh, draw on the strength of your ancestors,' mine weren't,\" she said, alluding to Adeline Rivers. \"She cracked and killed herself and abandoned her kids. So I lived in the present. And I went with the people that took me in and taught me and accepted me and didn't provide this kind of resistance.\"\n\nHow does one square these statements with Hoover's reference, in an e-mail about Kahnawà:ke, to \"people who knew people i'm related to\"? Or with what she allegedly told friends at Weston's wedding? Does it seem plausible that Hoover, a budding anthropologist, would have arrived in Kahnawà:ke, come so close to finding answers about who she was, and then just walked away?\n\nSome of Hoover's friends and colleagues have come to distrust her over time. In 2019, Hoover co-edited a book of essays about food sovereignty with a scholar at the University of Kansas named Devon Mihesuah. In the book's original biographical materials, Hoover listed herself as Mohawk and Mi'kmaq. But after another of the book's contributors was accused of being a Pretendian, Hoover, without alerting Mihesuah, contacted the publisher and asked to have her tribal affiliations removed from this material. Mihesuah doesn't understand why Hoover would do this unless she doubted the veracity of the affiliations. (Hoover says that including her affiliations alongside Mihesuah's felt inappropriate given that, unlike Mihesuah, she wasn't an enrolled citizen.)\n\nThat same year, Hoover published an article in the Review of International American Studies titled \" 'Fires were lit inside them:' The Pyropolitics of Water Protector Camps at Standing Rock.\" When Jennifer Weston read it, she saw that language had been lifted, without attribution, from the slides that she had given Hoover years before. She confronted Hoover, who said it had been an innocent mistake and asked the journal to issue an erratum. Later, Weston said, Hoover sent her a long handwritten explanation for what had happened. The letter came wrapped in \"some kind of greenery,\" Weston told me. \"I don't know if she put cedar or something in there with it. I guess she was intending to communicate some sort of healing energy or whatever.\"\n\nWhen Weston eventually read both of Hoover's statements of identity, she could not recognize the person described there. \"As someone who has known Elizabeth for twenty years, both of her statements are fraught with misinformation and misrepresentation,\" she told me. Weston refuses to believe that Hoover never researched her genealogy. \"She did look,\" Weston said.\n\nAlthough Hoover has support from some professors, the leadership of her department has turned against her. When the current school year started, two of her three graduate students refused to work with her. One of them, a Native student, had put aside community work to study at Berkeley with Hoover's encouragement. She has switched advisers. As Hoover's own career demonstrates, mentorship is crucial to academic success.\n\n\"I'm not going to be driven out, because I still have usefulness,\" Hoover told me. \"I still did all that work. I did the research, I did all the learning, I did the teaching. And I'm not going to have all of that just cancelled and thrown away because people are upset about this.\"\n\nFor a long time, Hoover continued to show up to every department meeting, even to parties and retreats where her presence wasn't mandatory. Some of her former students and faculty friends began to dread running into her. Eventually, the chair of her department announced via e-mail that Hoover would stop attending these events; the department's administration also quietly tried to make sure that Hoover no longer worked in Native communities, as she had promised in her statement of accountability. (Hoover says she has upheld her promise without any administrative intervention.)\n\nAlmost immediately, however, rumors circulated that Hoover was breaking that promise, taking part in cultural burns-the lighting of controlled fires to manage Native land-and posting photos of herself at these events on Facebook. Hoover denies that the burns are part of her scholarly work and says that she had been invited by the tribal chairperson who hosted the burns. (The tribal chairperson did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nOne day last fall, the Native grad student who had paused her community work was feeling overwhelmed by the turmoil in her new department and went to a cultural burn up north. She wanted to be around people who weren't embroiled in the drama surrounding Hoover, she told me. When she got to the burn, which was crowded, Hoover was there. The tribal chairperson acknowledged Hoover, announcing that she had given him a beaded medallion a year or two before. \"And then she was at the campfires, laughing really loud, like how Native women usually laugh,\" the grad student said. \"It's weird she laughs like that.\" ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Do We Have the History of Native Americans Backward?\n\nI remember when I first encountered what must be the best-selling book of Native American history ever published, \" Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee ,\" by Dee Brown. I was twenty years old, and had made my way from the Leech Lake Reservation, in northern Minnesota, where I grew up, to Princeton, in a part of New Jersey that seemed to have no Indians at all. Since \"Bury My Heart\" appeared, in 1970, it has been translated into seventeen languages, and sold millions of copies. In the opening pages, Brown wrote, \"The greatest concentration of recorded experience and observation came out of the thirty-year span between 1860 and 1890-the period covered by this book. It was an incredible era of violence, greed, audacity, sentimentality, undirected exuberance, and an almost reverential attitude toward the ideal of personal freedom for those who already had it. During that time the culture and civilization of the American Indian was destroyed.\"\n\nI read this on the hundredth anniversary of the 1890 massacre at Wounded Knee Creek, in South Dakota. It was the last major armed conflict between an Indian tribe and the U.S. government, and more than two hundred and fifty Lakota men, women, and children were murdered there. Far from my Ojibwe homeland-marooned, I sometimes felt, on the distant shore of a self-satisfied republic-I readily accepted the version of history promoted by Brown's book: that Native American history was a litany of abuses (disease, slavery, warfare, dispossession, forced removal, the near-extermination of the American bison, land grabs, forced assimilation) that had erased our way of life. And yet my culture and civilization didn't feel gone. When I looked westward and back in time, I couldn't help think that Brown's historical record was incomplete-that the announcement of our collective death was rather premature.\n\nPekka Hämäläinen's \" Indigenous Continent \" (Liveright) boldly sets out a counternarrative. In its opening pages, Hämäläinen-a Helsinki-born scholar at Oxford who specializes in early and Indigenous American history-maintains that the America we know was, in its borders, shape, and culture, far from inevitable. Even after the so-called colonial era, tribal nations often played a determining role in American history. In his view, we should speak not of \"colonial America\" but of \"an Indigenous America that was only slowly and unevenly becoming colonial,\" and recognize that the central reality of the period was ongoing Indigenous resistance. By 1776, he notes, European powers had claimed most of the continent, but Indigenous people continued to control it. Instead of a foreordained story of decline and victimization, Hämäläinen wants us to see a parade of contingencies, with Native nations regularly giving as good as they got, or even better. The result, he promises, will be a North American history recentered on Native people and their own \"overwhelming and persisting\" power. Like treaties, though, scholarly promises have often been broken. Is Hämäläinen true to his word?\n\nDiscover notable new fiction, nonfiction, and poetry.\n\nThroughout the roughly chronological work, Hämäläinen stresses movement. Tribal travellers crossed the Bering land bridge during the last Ice Age, and then, around 11,000 B.C.E., traversed an ice-free corridor along the flank of the Rocky Mountains, following game and evolving, culturally, as they went. Hämäläinen notes that other migration waves may have moved, in skin boats, through a maritime route, a seafood-rich \"kelp highway,\" that traced the Pacific Coast from Alaska to Patagonia. However settlement occurred, it happened quickly.\n\nHämäläinen spends the opening pages of the book detailing the rise and fall of early empires, in the Southwest and the Midwest in particular. \"A distinctive pattern of simultaneous centralization and decentralization,\" he says, characterized Indigenous history in the early second millennium C.E. Regional centers of power emerged; subordinate groups would rebel or break off and sometimes create their own centers of power. Some of these societies were highly stratified and hierarchical, with élites and, in certain cases, a kinglike single ruler. Such societies led to the development of Mogollon, Hohokam, and Ancestral Puebloan cultures in the Southwest. An ecological warm period, combined with new food technologies (the breeding and cultivation of corn, beans, and squash), helped give rise to the city of Cahokia, where the Mississippi and the Missouri Rivers joined-the site of present-day St. Louis. Cahokia grew in population and size and had hundreds of ceremonial structures in the form of earthen mounds and plazas. At its peak, in the tenth and eleventh centuries, about forty thousand people lived in the vicinity. (It took seven centuries before North America saw a more populous city: Philadelphia, in 1790.)\n\nBut political culture was affected by climate. As temperatures dropped during the Little Ice Age, in the fourteenth century, Hämäläinen writes, \"everything had to be smaller.\" Cahokia's society fractured into more mobile, less hierarchical groups, with hunting replacing farming as the dominant mode of living, and something similar happened in other dense Mississippian settlements. \"Across the eastern half of the continent, people seem to have rejected the domineering priestly class for more collective and egalitarian social arrangements,\" he concludes.\n\nHämäläinen's broader point is that, long before the Europeans arrived, the peoples of the New World didn't inhabit the stasis of an ethnographer's account; they experienced a tumultuous process of continual change, which is to say, they were social and political actors. By the sixteenth century, around five million Native people had inhabited or made use of almost every part of North America. The usual story depicts them as dwelling in harmony with one another and the natural world in some cultural and ecological Eden that was then torn apart by Europeans. In fact, as Hämäläinen shows, they manipulated nature-rerouting water to create gardens in the desert, domesticating cultivars through seed selection-and they projected power, sometimes in violent ways, subordinating or being subordinated to their neighbors. They didn't live in harmony; they lived in history.\n\nJust as the initial settlement of the New World was marked by movement, so, too, were Indigenous forms of domination. It's a thesis that Hämäläinen elaborated in an influential previous book, \" The Comanche Empire \" (2008): where European empires tended to be sedentary, marking power through permanent structures, dominant Native ones were \"kinetic empires,\" with everything-markets, missions, political assemblies-kept fluid and in motion. From the perspective of their neighbors, who were subject to their opportunistic, long-distance raids, the Comanches were, he noted, \"everywhere and nowhere.\"\n\nThe same kinetic strategy often characterized the Native response to European invasion and settlement-the early Spanish attempts to colonize Florida and the American Southwest, the English efforts to gain a foothold on the East Coast, followed by the French in the north and mid-continent, and the Dutch efforts around New York and the Hudson Valley. Hämäläinen wants us to see these colonial forays from a Native perspective, and to focus on how tribal nations retained their ascendancy.\n\nWhen Hernando de Soto explored Florida and regions to the north, Hämäläinen recounts, he ventured into the territory of the Cofitachequi Nation, where he met its leader, known as the Lady of Cofitachequi, who was brought to the meeting on a litter. Perhaps sensing a chance to trade, she gave de Soto a pearl necklace; in response, he took her captive. The expedition moved on, in pursuit of even greater wealth. All this could sound like a story of colonial triumph, but Hämäläinen argues that we have it backward: \"Soto and other conquistadors believed they were conquering new lands for the Spanish Empire, but in reality, Indians were carefully steering the Europeans' course, sending them away with fantastical stories of treasures farther ahead.\" And that's a pattern that he regularly lays out: often, when European conquerors thought that they were subjugating tribal nations, the Europeans were actually being manipulated and controlled by them.\n\nAnd what looked like bold military successes frequently involved a misunderstanding of Indigenous political structures. In the American Southwest, conquistadors such as Juan de Oñate and Vicente de Zaldívar thought they were controlling the so-called Pueblo Empire by decapitating it, as had been done among the Incas and the Maya. Yet the Pueblo communities in the Southwest were a loosely allied network of autonomous towns, rather than a centrally organized kingdom. Massacres at places like Acoma-where, in 1599, the Spanish killed around eight hundred Pueblo in retaliation for the deaths of a dozen Spanish soldiers-didn't change the balance of power; they merely taught Indigenous people that the Spaniards were to be resisted. By the end of the sixteenth century, after nearly a hundred years of attempted conquests, Spain had failed to establish any serious settlements in North America.\n\nHämäläinen shows how the persistent power of Indigenous people similarly caused the early collapse of Jamestown. During the \"starving time\" of 1609-10, the English colonists-unable to hunt and unwilling to farm-ate dogs, cats, rats, horses, and, occasionally, one another. They failed to take the measure of the Powhatans, who had already subjugated a number of rival tribal nations. Now it was the ravaged colonists, Hämäläinen tells us, who were incorporated into Powhatan power structures. Of course, that wasn't the end of the story. In 1611, three English ships, bearing hundreds of soldiers, showed up; as Jamestown was reoccupied, the English burned Powhatan cornfields and slaughtered entire Native settlements. It sounds like a familiar story of colonial cruelty, and yet Hämäläinen offers a different emphasis: such massacres, he says, were the actions of terrified, isolated, weak, and ultimately unstable communities. In Hämäläinen's view, the colonial violence \"exposed a deep-rooted European anxiety over enduring Indigenous power: the attacks were so vicious because the colonists feared the Indians who refused to submit to their rule.\" He notes that into the mid-seventeenth century-a century and a half after Columbus-the coastal settlements established by the English, French, and Dutch colonists remained fragile and hemmed in; most of the continent was effectively off limits to them. The struggle was for survival more than for territorial expansion.\n\nOnly in the late seventeenth century did the French and the English begin to push into the heartland, engaging complex configurations of Indigenous power in contending for control of the Great Lakes and the Ohio River Valley. Yet even then colonial gains were precarious and provisional. By the mid-eighteenth century, Indian rebellions had rolled back European incursions; the Spanish, the French, and the English clung mainly to the coasts and rivers. The vast interior of the continent was largely unknown to them, and the tidy lines of the thirteen colonies were more aspirational than actual.\n\nAs the Europeans sought to entrench an imperial presence on the continent, many tribes conglomerated into lasting yet plastic empires of their own. The Iroquois Confederacy (made up of the Cayuga, the Seneca, the Mohawk, the Onondaga, the Oneida, and the Tuscarora) was the most significant power in the Northeast; the Three Fires Confederacy (Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi) was largely in control of the western Great Lakes; and, later, the Comanche on the southern Plains and the Lakota (along with the Nakota and the Dakota, who spoke distinct dialects of the same language) had military control of larger sections of the continent than any single European power did. Hämäläinen encourages us to see this time not as a period of colonial conquest but as a clash of empires, some European and some Indigenous.\n\nIndigenous foreign policy among the Iroquois and the Three Fires confederacies had evolved into a kind of kinetic détente. My ancestors kept the French and the British off balance by making and breaking alliances as necessary, preventing both from getting the upper hand and keeping both dependent on Native nations. One of the side effects of this policy was the Seven Years' War, which can plausibly be regarded as the first world war. The conflict began in what's now Ohio, where an Odawa-French war chief named Charles Langlade led a coalition of Odawa, Potawatomi, and Ojibwe soldiers against a British fort near Pickawillany. They killed thirteen Miami soldiers and took the British hostage. The attackers executed an English blacksmith, who had been wounded in the attack, and then boiled and ate his heart in front of the horrified garrison. Vignettes such as these make the point that tribal nations, including my own, were shoving Europeans around (and eating their hearts) for quite a long time, and help dislodge the idea that tribes were either passively doomed or ineffectually violent.\n\nIn time, the reasons for the clash of Indigenous and European empires began to change: the contest wasn't simply for resources and the ability to transport them but for land itself. As the colonies expanded, accordingly, the elimination of tribal nations became a goal. By the time of the American Revolution, the French had been almost entirely expelled from what is now the United States, and the British pushed into what is now Canada; the Spanish, meanwhile, had divested themselves of most of their holdings north of the Rio Grande through war, treaties, and trade. Yet many tribal nations remained, too strong to ignore or subdue. Thayendanegea, an Iroquois leader, warned President Washington's Secretary of War, \"You consider yourselves as independent people; we, as the original inhabitants of this country, and sovereigns of the soil, look upon ourselves as equally independent, and free as any other nation or nations.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the new American nation found itself crushed under war debt; individual former colonies had different needs and pursued different foreign policies. The government couldn't sustain multiple wars against multiple Indigenous groups. Instead, it deployed treaties and settlements as a means of subjugation. In the Ohio Country, Congress sold millions of acres of land it didn't own to coastal speculators, who in turn enticed settlers with large tracts for little money. \"The strategy was obvious: once the land was sold, colonists would eradicate Native Americans on their own,\" Hämäläinen writes.\n\nAll in all, between 1783 and 1803, fighting with tribes drained the U.S. Treasury and absorbed roughly eighty per cent of all federal spending. As a result, the government was forced to expand its authority over regional entities; new powers granted by the Indian Trade and Intercourse Act, in 1790, elbowed aside individual states when it came to the making of treaties and to the control of trade with tribal nations. It was in reaction to Native power and resistance that the augmented role of the federal government-the \"United\" part of the United States-arose.\n\nAs the U.S. grew through the nineteenth century, the balances of power once again shifted; spasms of violence ranged across the West and pitted the Comanche, the Apache, the Cheyenne, and the Lakota against one another and against the federal government. The United States drew on its increasing supply of bodies and of wealth to destroy, bypass, or enfold Native nations on its march to the Pacific. In the last few chapters of \"Indigenous Continent,\" Hämäläinen, whose book on the Comanche was followed by one on the Lakota, spends a fair amount of time on these two highly kinetic nations.\n\n\"Indigenous Continent\" itself has a kinetic quality; the account is magisterial but also frenzied, bringing in a plethora of instances in its effort to complicate the standard account. Hämäläinen is fond of the long-distance scholarly raid, and the book often proceeds at a gallop. Still, the pace and the scope of the book have a force of their own: Hämäläinen makes it clear that America's past is crazily, energetically, tumultuously crowded with incident; that Indigenous power has affected everything about America.\n\nHas he delivered on the idea of an \"Indigenous continent\"? That's a harder question. The great value of Hämäläinen's work is as a corrective polemic. In restoring historical agency to Native peoples, he joins a number of accomplished historians who over the past generation have advanced Native scholarship, including Richard White, Patricia Limerick, Ned Blackhawk, Michael McDonnell, Elizabeth Fenn, and others. The Native historian Joshua Reid has startlingly challenged the very \"bifurcation of Indian versus non-Indian colonists.\" Because we know how things turned out, the argument goes, we're tempted to fixate on the power struggles between European and Native groups while overlooking power struggles among Native peoples. The Lakota, for example, are intelligible only in relation to the Dakota and the Mandan and the Arikara and the Hidatsa as well as to the Ojibwe, the French, the English, and, later, the Americans. Similarly, the Iroquois come into focus only by way of their relationships with the Dutch, the English, the Wyandot, the Shawnee, the French, the English, and the Choctaw. Hämäläinen shows us, again and again, how various European and tribal nations ebbed and flowed not in isolation but in constant tension.\n\nAnd yet the limitations of Hämäläinen's approach are striking, too. Despite his avowed aim to tell the story of North America from an Indigenous perspective, the main history he relates largely follows the white settlers in their movements. We get conflict zones in the Appalachians, south of the Great Lakes, in the Ohio River Valley, and, later, on the Great Plains, but in each instance Hämäläinen replicates the very thing he has said he was writing against: a fundamentally east-to-west story of European colonial expansion. Nor is the purview of \"Indigenous Continent\" exactly continental. Hämäläinen spends hardly any time in the Pacific Northwest or along the California coast. We learn little about the alliances and conflicts between tribal nations and the Spanish which flowed from north to south along the Rio Grande, from what is now Colorado to Mexico City. We learn little, for that matter, about the alliances and conflicts that the Iroquois and the Three Fires confederacies had with the British and the French in what is now Canada, extending all the way north to Hudson Bay. What we get is less an \"Indigenous continent\" than a Native United States.\n\nThe book is, at times, breathless in its exposition, and nuance is sometimes lost in the shuffle. So, too, are the attempts to include Indigenous concepts-linguistic, spiritual, cultural. Scholars will debate whether the formation and expansion of certain tribal nations are best understood in reference to European models of empire. And Hämäläinen's eagerness to characterize the colonial slaughter of Indigenous people as evidence of fear and weakness wears thin as the tide turns, and the story of pitched battle gives way to one of systematic subjugation.\n\nThere is, of course, only so much that one book can do. As it is, the tremendous scope of \"Indigenous Continent\" exacts a narrative cost: often it reads like a monkish chronicle-a quick succession of names, dates, harvests, tragedies, schisms, rejoinings, subsequent sunderings, wins, losses. But, if Hämäläinen's achievements are more circumscribed than his ambitions, it's impossible not to honor both. I can only wish that, when I was that lonely college junior and was finishing \"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee,\" I'd had Hämäläinen's book at hand. It would have helped me see that there was indeed a larger story: that my civilization hadn't been destroyed; that my tribe's contribution to the past wasn't merely to fade away in the face of history; that Native peoples-for better or for worse-made this country what it was, and have a role to play in what it now struggles to be. ♦\n\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the time period when tribal travellers traversed an ice-free corridor along the flank of the Rocky Mountains.\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

In the Ohio Country, Congress sold millions of acres of land it didn't own to coastal speculators, who in turn enticed settlers with large tracts for little money. \"The strategy was obvious: once the land was sold, colonists would eradicate Native Americans on their own,\" Hämäläinen writes.\n\nAll in all, between 1783 and 1803, fighting with tribes drained the U.S. Treasury and absorbed roughly eighty per cent of all federal spending. As a result, the government was forced to expand its authority over regional entities; new powers granted by the Indian Trade and Intercourse Act, in 1790, elbowed aside individual states when it came to the making of treaties and to the control of trade with tribal nations. It was in reaction to Native power and resistance that the augmented role of the federal government-the \"United\" part of the United States-arose.\n\nAs the U.S. grew through the nineteenth century, the balances of power once again shifted; spasms of violence ranged across the West and pitted the Comanche, the Apache, the Cheyenne, and the Lakota against one another and against the federal government. The United States drew on its increasing supply of bodies and of wealth to destroy, bypass, or enfold Native nations on its march to the Pacific. In the last few chapters of \"Indigenous Continent,\" Hämäläinen, whose book on the Comanche was followed by one on the Lakota, spends a fair amount of time on these two highly kinetic nations.\n\n\"Indigenous Continent\" itself has a kinetic quality; the account is magisterial but also frenzied, bringing in a plethora of instances in its effort to complicate the standard account. Hämäläinen is fond of the long-distance scholarly raid, and the book often proceeds at a gallop. Still, the pace and the scope of the book have a force of their own: Hämäläinen makes it clear that America's past is crazily, energetically, tumultuously crowded with incident; that Indigenous power has affected everything about America.\n\nHas he delivered on the idea of an \"Indigenous continent\"? That's a harder question. The great value of Hämäläinen's work is as a corrective polemic. In restoring historical agency to Native peoples, he joins a number of accomplished historians who over the past generation have advanced Native scholarship, including Richard White, Patricia Limerick, Ned Blackhawk, Michael McDonnell, Elizabeth Fenn, and others. The Native historian Joshua Reid has startlingly challenged the very \"bifurcation of Indian versus non-Indian colonists.\" Because we know how things turned out, the argument goes, we're tempted to fixate on the power struggles between European and Native groups while overlooking power struggles among Native peoples. The Lakota, for example, are intelligible only in relation to the Dakota and the Mandan and the Arikara and the Hidatsa as well as to the Ojibwe, the French, the English, and, later, the Americans. Similarly, the Iroquois come into focus only by way of their relationships with the Dutch, the English, the Wyandot, the Shawnee, the French, the English, and the Choctaw. Hämäläinen shows us, again and again, how various European and tribal nations ebbed and flowed not in isolation but in constant tension.\n\nAnd yet the limitations of Hämäläinen's approach are striking, too. Despite his avowed aim to tell the story of North America from an Indigenous perspective, the main history he relates largely follows the white settlers in their movements. We get conflict zones in the Appalachians, south of the Great Lakes, in the Ohio River Valley, and, later, on the Great Plains, but in each instance Hämäläinen replicates the very thing he has said he was writing against: a fundamentally east-to-west story of European colonial expansion. Nor is the purview of \"Indigenous Continent\" exactly continental. Hämäläinen spends hardly any time in the Pacific Northwest or along the California coast. We learn little about the alliances and conflicts between tribal nations and the Spanish which flowed from north to south along the Rio Grande, from what is now Colorado to Mexico City. We learn little, for that matter, about the alliances and conflicts that the Iroquois and the Three Fires confederacies had with the British and the French in what is now Canada, extending all the way north to Hudson Bay. What we get is less an \"Indigenous continent\" than a Native United States.\n\nThe book is, at times, breathless in its exposition, and nuance is sometimes lost in the shuffle. So, too, are the attempts to include Indigenous concepts-linguistic, spiritual, cultural. Scholars will debate whether the formation and expansion of certain tribal nations are best understood in reference to European models of empire. And Hämäläinen's eagerness to characterize the colonial slaughter of Indigenous people as evidence of fear and weakness wears thin as the tide turns, and the story of pitched battle gives way to one of systematic subjugation.\n\nThere is, of course, only so much that one book can do. As it is, the tremendous scope of \"Indigenous Continent\" exacts a narrative cost: often it reads like a monkish chronicle-a quick succession of names, dates, harvests, tragedies, schisms, rejoinings, subsequent sunderings, wins, losses. But, if Hämäläinen's achievements are more circumscribed than his ambitions, it's impossible not to honor both. I can only wish that, when I was that lonely college junior and was finishing \"Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee,\" I'd had Hämäläinen's book at hand. It would have helped me see that there was indeed a larger story: that my civilization hadn't been destroyed; that my tribe's contribution to the past wasn't merely to fade away in the face of history; that Native peoples-for better or for worse-made this country what it was, and have a role to play in what it now struggles to be. ♦\n\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the time period when tribal travellers traversed an ice-free corridor along the flank of the Rocky Mountains.\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Standing Rock: A New Moment for Native-American Rights\n\nThe last time Native Americans gathered and the nation noticed was in 1973. That February, after members of the Oglala Sioux tribe failed to impeach their chairman on charges of corruption, they, with leaders of the American Indian Movement, occupied the town of Wounded Knee, South Dakota. It was a final act in the movement's years-long campaign to compel the federal government to honor tribal treaty rights. Already, Native Americans had occupied Alcatraz Island, in a largely symbolic attempt to reclaim it, and Mt. Rushmore, which had been part of the Great Sioux Reservation until Congress redrew its borders. But at Wounded Knee the movement found its symbolic apex: the U.S. Marshals surrounded the occupiers, evoking the start of the massacre that had killed more than a hundred and fifty Lakota people in 1890. Over months, the standoff escalated. Officers manned roadblocks in armored personnel carriers, and neighboring states lent their National Guards. Both sides traded gunfire. The first man shot was a marshal, who survived but was paralyzed from the waist down. The second was a Cherokee man, who died. The third was Lawrence Lamont, an Oglala Lakota, whose death was the beginning of the end of the occupation.\n\nThere are echoes of Wounded Knee in the conflict that has sprung up near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation , in North Dakota. Since midsummer, thousands of Native Americans have gathered at the confluence of the Missouri and Cannonball Rivers to protest the construction of the Dakota Access oil pipeline, which would cut just north of the reservation border, crossing sacred sites and imperilling Standing Rock's water supply in the event of a rupture. In July, the tribe filed a lawsuit against the Army Corps of Engineers, the agency that approved the project, arguing that it had failed to consult with the tribe as required by federal law. While the suit has played out in court, the protesters have said that they will stay until the pipeline is stopped, through winter if they must.\n\nFederal officials have kept a careful distance, but what they have not lent in physical force the state has zealously supplied. In August, Governor Jack Dalrymple declared a state of emergency in North Dakota, warning executives at the pipeline company, Energy Transfer Partners, that his administration could no longer \"protect their workers adequately.\" Roadblocks were erected north of the protest encampment, and sheriff's deputies escorted school buses through the area. On September 3rd, the conflict reached its highest pitch. Protesters attempted to obstruct E.T.P.'s bulldozers, and in response the company sent in private security officers, who confronted them with pepper spray and dogs. Five days later, Dalrymple deployed the North Dakota National Guard. \"You've got a tinder box here, sir,\" Chris Berg, a local TV news anchor, told him in an interview.\n\nI arrived at the Standing Rock encampment the following evening with Lissa Yellowbird-Chase, a member of the Mandan, Hidatsa, and Arikara Nation in North Dakota, who had been attending the protests nearly every weekend since mid-August. Tents and tepees sprawled along the banks of the Cannonball River; Yellowbird-Chase's uncle, who joined us, joked that they reminded him of \"powwows in the old days, when we came by travois\"-horse-drawn sleds once used by the Plains Indians. Earlier that day, the protesters had won their first major victory. After a judge ruled against the Standing Rock Sioux, the Obama Administration intervened, announcing that the pipeline would not be permitted onto the federal land beneath the Missouri River until the tribe was properly consulted. In the coming months, the Corps will reassess the impacts of the pipeline and meet with tribal leaders regarding this and other infrastructure projects. The Administration also requested that E.T.P. pause work on private land within twenty miles east and west of the river, but this was only temporary: on October 9th, a federal appeals court again ruled against the Standing Rock Sioux, allowing construction on private land to continue. (The next day, the Administration renewed its stop-work request .)\n\nYellowbird-Chase set up camp by a grove of cottonwoods, for relief from the late-summer heat, and, beneath a tarp, hung a tin can containing cedar leaves and coals from a neighbor's fire to cleanse the site with smoke. The next morning, we set off for the main part of the encampment. I wondered whether the pause in construction would prompt people to leave, but it became clear, as we approached a mass of tent canopies, that the protest was still growing. Men and women unloaded donations from the trunks of cars-boxes of squash, bags of warm clothes-and passed them with cheerful efficiency down a line of volunteers. Others chopped firewood, hauled trash, peeled vegetables, and fed horses. I unloaded some donations and then joined Yellowbird-Chase for lunch. (It was important, she said, that \"we eat with the people.\") As we stood in line, friends and strangers stopped to chat. Many would greet us like this throughout the day, including an elderly white man who was handing out red feathers and who explained, timidly, that he'd dreamed of the protests before he'd come and, in this dream, had handed out red feathers. \"That's cool,\" Yellowbird-Chase said, and stuck one in her hair.\n\nOver the weekend, the encampment continued to swell with new visitors. Aztec dancers came from Minneapolis, then delegations from the Round Valley Indian Tribes in California, the Jemez Pueblo in New Mexico, and the Blackfeet Nation in Montana. They entered through a corridor lined with the flags of hundreds of other tribes who had offered support. These arrivals, which happened every day, signified as much a coming together of old enemies as of old friends. Weeks earlier, the Crow, who aided the U.S. Cavalry in its nineteenth-century battles against the Sioux, had come with blankets, coolers of meat, and a horse trailer full of cordwood.\n\nThe shared history that brought these tribes together is, of course, more recent than the massacre at Wounded Knee. In \"Custer Died for Your Sins,\" a manifesto of the Native American-rights movement from 1969, the Sioux historian Vine Deloria, Jr., observed that, although \"people often feel guilty about their ancestors killing all those Indians years ago,\" the twentieth century had in fact \"seen a more devious but hardly less successful war waged against Indian communities.\" Deloria was referring to a host of injustices: the lack of funding for tribal education, which forced parents to send their children to government-run boarding schools; the termination of federal recognition for scores of tribes, which caused the loss of services promised by treaty; and a disregard for the sovereignty of tribes, manifest in the building of infrastructure on Indian land without honest consultation or consent. In Deloria's time, that infrastructure was dams, which flooded forests and farmland on many reservations, including Standing Rock. Today, as Dave Archambault II, the tribe's chairman, suggested in an editorial for the Times , that infrastructure is pipelines. \"Tribes have always paid the price for America's prosperity,\" he wrote.\n\nMost days, protesters march or caravan to nearby construction sites to dance, sing, and engage in prayerful ceremonies. When I was there, though, they stayed home, buoyed and exhausted by the turn of events. In the catharsis of the encampment, it would have been easy to forget the anxiety present just to the north, were it not for the surveillance helicopters circling daily overhead. As one hovered low over the encampment one evening, Yellowbird-Chase said wryly, \"They're making sure we've had our three meals today.\" Some found these intrusions funny, as if the state were a petulant little brother, taking his games too seriously. I, and others, found them dissonant and unsettling. One morning, I ventured out to the pipeline route, on dirt roads through open pasture, and came across eight vehicles, six of them law enforcement. Another belonged to a local rancher, who told me, \"When you see cars full of people and no license plate and bats in the back, you fear for your family.\" I asked whether he was willing to stay and talk longer. \"No,\" he said. \"It's too dangerous.\"\n\nWhen people compare Standing Rock with Wounded Knee, they note that, at the height of the 1973 occupation, there were several hundred protesters; now there are several thousand, owing in part to social media. But there is another important distinction, which is that the movement has largely committed itself to nonviolence. At least ninety people have been arrested so far for acts of civil disobedience-trespassing on construction sites and locking themselves to bulldozers-but none were carrying weapons or behaving violently. In the confrontation on September 3rd, six protesters were bitten by dogs, and one security officer was pinned against his truck, then let go without injury. (The rancher I met, who said he witnessed the skirmish, claimed that he had seen Native Americans armed with tomahawks.) The protesters have taken to calling themselves \"protectors,\" a semantic distinction that can sound a little hokey until you recall the historical stereotypes of savagery that they are laboring against.\n\nOn September 25th, protesters returned to the construction site to plant corn and willow trees in the pathway of the pipeline. Sheriff Kyle Kirchmeier told the local press that a security guard was assaulted, sustaining minor injuries, and a protester was spotted with a gun. (Kirchmeier's office did not supply evidence of either claim, and no arrests were made.) Then, on September 28th, in perhaps the most troubling confrontation so far, officers surrounded a group of protesters, holding loaded rifles. The protesters threw their arms in the air, shouting, \"We have no weapons! We have no weapons!\" Both sides retreated unscathed, but it was a deaf and reckless nod to history on the part of the state. And it made me wonder whether the weapons that officers have seen are imagined, a way to give form to the fear that the protest inspires-the fear not of violence but of a people who have survived, who remember things the rest of us often choose to forget, and who have found each other, again, through this memory.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "How Native Americans Will Shape the Future of Water in the West\n\nAs a child, Stephen Lewis heard stories about a river that, for the most part, no longer flowed. \"How I grew up was that it was a theft, that it was stolen from us,\" he told me late last year. \"There was what we used to call the Mighty Gila River, and now it was just pretty much dry. There was no water.\"\n\nLewis is the governor of the Gila River Indian Community ( GRIC ), a group that has occupied land south of Phoenix for centuries. When I met him, in the dining room of the Whirlwind Golf Club, which the tribe owns, Lewis had recently returned from Santa Fe. There, he'd attended a celebration marking the centennial of the Colorado River Compact, an agreement that continues to shape water politics in the Southwest. In Santa Fe, Lewis took note of a black-and-white photograph of the compact's signers-white men in dark jackets, gathered around a wooden desk.\n\nIn the United States, water law is founded on the principle of \"first in time, first in right\"-whoever first put water to \"beneficial use\" can claim the right to use it now and in the future. In the 1922 compact, though, tribal nations are mentioned only in passing. \"The Colorado River Compact basically just assumed that tribes were going to go away, the United States was going to figure it out, nobody had to care,\" Jay Weiner, a tribal attorney from Montana, told me. Instead, in recent years, as the worst drought in more than a thousand years has seized the Southwest, the region's tribal nations have been asserting their legal rights to the contentious, increasingly scarce commodity of water. In 2004, GRIC signed an agreement with the federal government that gave them the right to more than six hundred and fifty thousand acre-feet of water, much of it from the Colorado River. The settlement made GRIC one of the largest rights holders of Colorado River water in Arizona; the community controls more of the river's water than the state of Nevada. Tribal nations could soon hold the legal right to about twenty per cent of the Colorado River's flow, including unresolved claims. (Some Southwestern tribes have yet to come to an official agreement over their water entitlements.)\n\n\"What used to happen is that the powers that be would get together and figure out what to do, and then tell everyone else what the plan was,\" Lewis said. \"And what's changed is that you just can't do that anymore. Those days are over.\"\n\nLewis's father, Rod, studied medieval history in graduate school, where he expressed his arch sense of humor, and his pride in his heritage, through his school assignments. \"He'd write, like, 'While in England they were living in houses insulated with excrement and running around, painting their faces blue and purple, the Hohokam were building sophisticated canal water-delivery systems,' \" Lewis recalled, laughing.\n\nIn the nineteenth century, the Akimel O'otham, a tribe of Hohokam descendants that the Spanish called the Pima, lived among cottonwoods and willows along the banks of the Gila, a tributary of the Colorado that flows through New Mexico and Arizona. The river was central to their economic and spiritual life. The Pima directed the water's flow through a system of ditches and culverts, and developed an extensive agricultural system, growing watermelons, beans, corn, squash, cotton, and tobacco.\n\nWestward-bound migrants passing through the Sonoran Desert-gold-rushers, Mormon settlers, surveyors, military scouts, trappers-came to rely on the Pima lands as a crucial provisioning stop on the arduous journey, the historian David DeJong writes, in \" Stealing the Gila: The Pima Agricultural Economy and Water Deprivation, 1848-1921 .\" The tribe found lost horses, allowed bony oxen teams to graze their fields, and established a robust business selling surplus crops and water. They acquired a reputation for being friendly, industrious, entrepreneurial. By the late eighteen-sixties, they were selling agricultural commodities in vast quantities: thirty thousand pounds of corn, a million pounds of wheat annually.\n\nAfter the U.S. gained control of the area in the Mexican-American War, Pima leaders sought confirmation that their land rights would be respected, and were repeatedly assured that they would be. Army officers and government agents stationed in the region understood that the U.S. needed the Pima more than the other way around. \"So far, they have been more blessed in giving than receiving, and have looked in vain for recognition by the government of the many kindnesses they have rendered our people,\" one government official wrote. Another put it more directly: \"It is necessary to do more than conciliate these Indians by presents. They must be secured in their possession of their lands.\"\n\nIn 1859, Congress established the Gila River Indian Reservation, which included both the Pima and their neighbors, the Maricopa, also known as the Pee Posh. But whatever security this decision ostensibly provided was quickly undermined by federal legislation encouraging westward development, which gave settlers deeds to land as long as they irrigated and cultivated their acreage within three years. Newcomers claimed land upstream of the reservation and diverted the river for their own use. The Pima's agricultural system, which had been carefully managed based on the tribe's understanding of the Gila's cyclical flows, began to falter. By the turn of the century, the Pima were irrigating only a quarter of the acreage they had forty years earlier. The community, which had been famous for its mercantile abundance, was now marked by deprivation. In 1900, a Chicago Tribune headline summed up the situation succinctly: \"Indians Starving to Death.\"\n\nWith the decline of their traditional staples, the community increasingly relied on provisions from the federal government: subsidized sugar, subsidized flour. In the nineteen-sixties, researchers from the National Institutes of Health came to study the community. They concluded that it had one of the highest recorded rates of Type 2 diabetes in the world.\n\nA few years later, the American Indian Law Center established a summer pre-law program to encourage more young Native people to become attorneys. Rod Lewis was one of the program's first students. He went on to graduate from U.C.L.A. Law School and became the first Native American attorney in Arizona. When Stephen Lewis was a child, the family took a trip to J. C. Penney to get his father a black suit. Rod had a case coming up in front of the Supreme Court. He won it, becoming the first Native attorney to argue-and to win-a case before the Court.\n\nAs a student of history, Rod Lewis was aware that water was key to his community's self-sufficiency. In 1978, he became GRIC 's general counsel-the first tribal member to serve in that role-and turned his attention to water rights. Because of its agrarian past, the community had a strong case. By the late nineties, it had a further advantage. The city of Phoenix was sprawling south, which made GRIC 's land increasingly valuable to developers. The golf club where I met Stephen Lewis is surrounded by a luxury outlet mall, embellished with touches of Southwestern flair, and a resort complex of hotels and casinos. Because GRIC was well resourced, the tribe could afford the protracted legal wrangling that eventually led to its water settlement.\n\nAlthough the settlement ostensibly gave GRIC substantial water rights, it didn't immediately change the dynamics of water politics in Arizona. \"There's a difference between having a piece of paper that says you have water and actually being able to put that water to use,\" Tom Buschatzke, the director of the Arizona Department of Water Resources, told me. \"And the way Western water law developed, you can get the right to use water, but, if you don't use it, the next person down the line can use it instead.\"\n\nA few years after the settlement, the community took steps to make use of its entire water entitlement. It invested in hundreds of miles of canals to channel about two hundred thousand acre-feet of water to the reservation-which was used mostly to irrigate crops. ( GRIC is working to line these canals with solar panels, a project that's the first of its kind in the Western Hemisphere.) They also took a further step, slogging through the complex bureaucratic and logistical process required to store the rest of their water underground. Arizona law incentivizes underground water storage, which replenishes the state's aquifers, by allowing those who do it to sell water credits on the open market to developers and municipalities. (Arizona requires that new development has access to a hundred-year \"assured water supply\"; water credits can serve this purpose.) \"They essentially turned their water rights into a marketable asset,\" Sharon Megdal, the director of the University of Arizona's Water Resources Research Center, said.\n\nAccording to GRIC 's outside counsel, Jason Hauter, this move shook things up in Arizona: \"In 2010, when we started storing our water, that upset assumptions, especially in the ag community, the home-building community\"-two sectors that might have been able to use the water if GRIC hadn't. \"I think there was an assumption that, 'Oh, they're dumb Indians, they can't use that water; they won't know what to do. Well, no.' \"\n\nHauter is a tall, resolute man who graduated from the same pre-law summer program as Rod Lewis. After lunch, he drove Stephen Lewis and me farther into the reservation. \"We had these vast mesquite bosques,\" Lewis said, looking out at the dry, flat scrubland. \"But when we didn't have water and we couldn't farm, we had to cut down the bosques and sell the wood. That's why you see a lot of these areas are just deforested. But we're trying to bring the habitat back.\"\n\nThe Southwest's protracted drought has put a strain on an already arid environment. In 2007, the states that got water from the Colorado agreed to reduce their use. But, as the drought wore on for another decade and was exacerbated by climate change, it became clear that more reductions were needed to keep Lake Mead, which supplies water and hydroelectricity to millions of people, from declining to dangerously low levels. The negotiations about who would bear the brunt of those cuts were extensive and thorny. \"In so many political issues, you kind of have two sides,\" Buschatzke said. \"In water, you have fifty sides-it's exponentially more challenging. And, in a lot of political issues, people may have wants or needs. In water, they have legal rights.\"\n\nIn 2018, Arizona formed a steering committee to come up with a plan, with delegates from GRIC and two other tribes, as well as farmers, developers, lawmakers, and environmentalists. During one meeting, Stefanie Smallhouse, the president of the Arizona Farm Bureau, made an impassioned speech on behalf of Arizona's agricultural interests. A hundred and fifty years ago, she said, men like Jack Swilling, a prospector and a Confederate veteran, had settled in the area and begun to irrigate the desert. \"There wasn't anybody else here,\" she said. \"There were relics of past tribal farming, but he was pretty much the starter.\"\n\nStephen Lewis spoke a few minutes later, managing to keep most, but not all, of the anger out of his voice. \"I think we sell ourselves short when we talk about one hundred and fifty years, three hundred and fifty years,\" he said. \"We've been farming for over a thousand years.\" GRIC also knew what it was like to have water taken away. \"We have family stories of the devastation,\" he said. \"The social, medical, historical trauma that is still with us today.\" Because of that history, the community saw itself as a kind of moral compass for the ongoing negotiations. \"We could say, 'We're not going to take cuts, we're going to fight everything, we have superior rights because of our history of water use, because of who we are,' \" Lewis told me later. \"We're not doing that. We're willing to sacrifice-it just has to be a shared sacrifice.\"\n\nAfter years of negotiations, Arizona came up with a drought contingency plan that relied, in substantial part, on GRIC 's willingness to leave two hundred thousand acre-feet of water in Lake Mead. The community was compensated about two hundred and fifty dollars an acre-foot for part of the water they left in the reservoir (they left fifty thousand acre-feet available for uncompensated conservation); if they had instead withdrawn the water and sold the credits on the open market, they would have fetched about twice as much, Hauter estimated. \"There's an opportunity cost, but having a stable system, even if it means having to sacrifice, makes sense to the community,\" he said.\n\nBut the Southwest's water woes have not been solved. Last year, the Bureau of Reclamation announced that Colorado River basin states and tribes would have to come up with an additional two to four million acre-feet of reductions to avert disaster-substantially more than they'd managed to agree to during the past two decades of tense discussions. What that plan will look like is still being worked out, but, as negotiations progressed last summer, Lewis grew worried that the community's willingness to compromise would result in it being taken advantage of. Frustrated that more progress wasn't being made, GRIC briefly pulled out of discussions. \"We are aware that this approach will have a very significant impact on the ability of the State of Arizona to make any meaningful commitment to water reductions,\" Lewis wrote in a statement, \"but we cannot continue to put the interests of all others above our own when no other parties seem committed to the common goal of a cooperative basin-wide agreement.\" Shortly afterward, encouraged in part by the Inflation Reduction Act, which allocated four billion dollars to improving water infrastructure, GRIC returned to the negotiating table. Still, the community's point seems to have gotten across. \"I know that they don ' t want to be characterized as a source of water that will solve the state's problems,\" Buschatzke told me.\n\nAmid all the water-wrangling and water-politicking, one of Stephen Lewis's goals as governor was to restore part of the Gila River ecosystem; he wanted to show me the result. We walked down a dirt path edged by willows toward a thin ribbon of river, lined with cattails. It felt like another world after those miles of stark scrubland. A bird swooped low, and we were surrounded by the thrum of insects.\n\nThis restored riparian zone, which goes by the unromantic name Managed Aquifer Recharge 5, was part of GRIC 's water-storage project. Storing the water underground-that is, pumping it here and essentially allowing it to seep into the aquifer-not only supplied the community with marketable water credits, it had also radically transformed this small patch of desert. \"It's the best example I've seen of a fully integrated water-management plan,\" Megdal, of the Water Resources Research Center, told me later. \"They take care of the economy, the environment, the water management. It's all there.\"\n\nI stood on a metal grate and tried to make sense of the system of concrete culverts, pumps, and diverters that had made this small oasis possible. The river was more infrastructure than nature-but most of them are, these days. And there's nothing like the rich smell of water in the desert. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

Photos via Library of Congress & Wikimedia Commons.\n\nHere are three scenes from the history of slavery in North America. In 1637, a group of Pequot Indians, men and boys, having risen up against English colonists in Connecticut and been defeated, were sold to plantations in the West Indies in exchange for African slaves, allowing the colonists to remove a resistant element from their midst . (The tribe's women were pressed into service in white homes in New England, where domestic workers were sorely lacking.) In 1741, an 800-foot-long coffle of recently enslaved Sioux Indians, procured by a group of Cree, Assiniboine, and Monsoni warriors, arrived in Montreal, ready for sale to French colonists hungry for domestic and agricultural labor. And in 1837, Cherokee Joseph Vann, expelled from his land in Georgia during the era of Indian removal , took at least 48 enslaved black people along with him to Indian Territory. By the 1840s, Vann was said to have owned hundreds of enslaved black laborers, as well as racehorses and a side-wheeler steamboat .\n\nRebecca Onion is a Slate staff writer and the author of Innocent Experiments .\n\nA reductive view of the American past might note two major, centuries-long historical sins: the enslavement of stolen Africans and the displacement of Native Americans. In recent years, a new wave of historians of American slavery has been directing attention to the ways these sins overlapped. The stories they have uncovered throw African slavery-still the narrative that dominates our national memory-into a different light, revealing that the seeds of that system were sown in earlier attempts to exploit Native labor. The record of Native enslavement also shows how the white desire to put workers in bondage intensified the chaos of contact, disrupting intertribal politics and creating uncertainty and instability among people already struggling to adapt to a radically new balance of power.\n\nBefore looking at the way Native enslavement happened on the local level (really the only way to approach a history this fragmented and various), it helps to appreciate the sweep of the phenomenon. How common was it for Indians to be enslaved by Euro-Americans? Counting can be difficult, because many instances of Native enslavement in the Colonial period were illegal or ad hoc and left no paper trail. But historians have tried. A few of their estimates: Thousands of Indians were enslaved in Colonial New England, according to Margaret Ellen Newell. Alan Gallay writes that between 1670 and 1715, more Indians were exported into slavery through Charles Town (now Charleston, South Carolina) than Africans were imported. Brett Rushforth recently attempted a tally of the total numbers of enslaved, and he told me that he thinks 2 million to 4 million indigenous people in the Americas, North and South, may have been enslaved over the centuries that the practice prevailed-a much larger number than had previously been thought. \"It's not on the level of the African slave trade,\" which brought 10 million people to the Americas , but the earliest history of the European colonies in the Americas is marked by Native bondage. \"If you go up to about 1680 or 1690 there still, by that period, had been more enslaved Indians than enslaved Africans in the Americas.\"\n\nBetween 1670 and 1715, more Indians were exported into slavery through Charles Town than Africans were imported.\n\nThe practice dates back to the earliest history of the European colonies in the future United States. Take the example of the Pequot who were enslaved in 1637 after clashing with the English. As Newell writes in a new book, Brethren by Nature: New England Indians, Colonists, and the Origins of American Slavery , by the time the ship Desire transported the defeated Pequot men and boys to the Caribbean, colonists in New England, desperate for bodies and hands to supplement their own meager workforce, had spent years trying out various strategies of binding Native labor.\n\nDuring the Pequot War, which was initially instigated by struggles over trade and land among the Europeans, the Pequot, and rival tribes, colonists explicitly named the procurement of captives as one of their goals. Soldiers sent groups of captured Pequot to Boston and other cities for distribution, while claiming particular captured people as their own. Soldier Israel Stoughton wrote to John Winthrop, having sent \"48 or 50 women and Children\" to the governor to distribute as he pleased:\n\nA few years after the conclusion of the war, in 1641, the colonists of Massachusetts Bay passed the first formal law regulating slavery in English America, in a section of the longer document known as the Body of Liberties . The section's language allowed enslavement of \"those lawfull Captives taken in just warres, and such strangers as willingly selle themselves or are sold to us,\" and left room for legal bondage of others the authorities might deem enslaved in the future. The Body of Liberties codified the colonists' possession of Native workers and opened the door for the expansion of African enslavement.\n\n* * *\n\nEuropeans did not introduce slavery to this continent. Many, though not all, of the Native groups in the land that later became the United States and Canada practiced slavery before Europeans arrived. Native tribes, in their diversity, did not have a uniform approach to enslavement (given Americans' propensity to collapse all Native people together, this bears reiterating). Many of those traditions also changed when tribes began to contend with the European presence. \"There are many slaveries, and colonialism brings different slaveries into contact with one another,\" historian Christina Snyder, who wrote a history of Native slavery in the Southeast, told me. Contact pushed Native practices to change over time, as tribes contested, or adapted to, European demands. But, broadly speaking, Native types of enslavement were often about kinship, reproductive labor, and diplomacy, rather than solely the extraction of agricultural or domestic labor. The difference between these slaveries and European bondage of Africans was great.\n\nHistorian Pekka Hämäläinen, in his 2009 book The Comanche Empire , writes of Comanche uses of slavery during their period of dominance of the American Southwest between 1750 and 1850. The Comanche exercised hegemony in part by numerical superiority, and enslavement was part of that strategy. Hämäläinen writes that Comanches put captives through a rigorous process of enslavement-a dehumanizing initiation that brought a non-Comanche captive into the tribe through renaming, tattooing, beating, whipping, mutilation, and starvation-but stipulates that once a person was enslaved, there were varying degrees of freedom and privilege she or he could attain. Male captives might be made blood bondsmen with their owners, protecting them from ill treatment and casual sale; women might be married into the tribe, after which time they became, as Hämäläinen puts it, \"full-fledged tribal members\"; younger, more impressionable children might be adopted outright. After a period of trauma, captives could, quite possibly, attain quasi-free status; their own children would be Comanches.\n\nPhoto illustration by Lisa Larson-Walker. Photos via Library of Congress & Wikimedia Commons.\n\nIn his book Bonds of Alliance: Indigenous and Atlantic Slaveries in New France , Brett Rushforth writes about a similar tradition of \"natal alienation\" practiced by enslaving tribes in the Pays d'en Haut (the French name for the Great Lakes region and the land west of Montreal) in order to strip a captive of his or her old identity and life. Rushforth does not sell short the awfulness of these processes; still, he pointed out: \"Rather than a closed slave system designed to move slaves 'up and out'-excluding slaves and their descendants from full participation in their masters' society, even when freed-indigenous slavery moved captives 'up and in' toward full, if forced, assimilation.\" This was more than Africans enslaved by Europeans could hope for, after the legal codification of hereditary chattel slavery in the 17 th and early 18 th centuries.\n\nAs many as 10,000 Indians were enslaved between 1660â1760. Here are the names we know.\n\nThe disconnect between Native uses of slavery and European understandings of the practice often made for miscommunication. In some places, ironically enough, Native groups themselves initiated the trade in captives to the Europeans. In the Pays d'en Haut, Rushforth found in his research, Indian groups believed in \"a diplomatic function of captive-taking.\" Early in their time in the area, French officials found themselves offered Native slaves as tokens of trust, peace, and friendship. \"When the French embedded themselves in these Native systems of alliance and trade and diplomacy, they found themselves engaged in these captive exchanges-not unwillingly, of course,\" Rushforth told me. \"At the same time, the French were trading African slaves in the Caribbean and South America, so it's not like the Indians forced this upon the French. The French found the diplomatic function of it to be kind of confusing. They didn't know what to make of it at first, and then they sort of manipulated it to their own advantage.\"\n\nIn some places, Native groups themselves initiated the trade in captives to the Europeans.\n\nRushforth notes that the political equilibrium that prevailed before the arrival of Europeans had kept the Native slave trade minimal. \"If you're a Native group in the Midwest and it's hunting season, you have to make a choice,\" he said. \" 'Are we going to go after an enemy, or are we going to stock up on meat and hides and other things?' It's either hunting or captive-raiding. And so that created these disincentives to go after captives, because there were all kinds of reasons you wanted to have peace, all kinds of reasons you wanted to have your economy running.\"\n\nSoon, however, French officials, desiring more slaves, began to incentivize Native people to take captives by promising desirable goods in return. Nearby tribes began to raid one another in earnest, often venturing far into the interior of the present-day United States to grab Pawnee and other Plains Indians. With French traders now offering goods and comestibles in exchange for captives, the old political balance was disrupted. \"If you can go raid your enemies and trade them, for food and cloth and other things, you can actually sort of collapse those two choices into one,\" Rushforth said. \"That means the choice to raid for captives was much less costly for them. And so they actually did it much more often.\" The French, wanting to be secure from violence in Montreal, made rules that pushed the chaos of raiding farther away-circumscribing the sale of Native slaves from nearby tribes, for example. \"So they can create all of this extractive force,\" Rushforth noted, \"and it just makes everything chaotic and destructive out there.\"\n\nAmerica's defining institution, as told through the lives of nine enslaved people. Enroll in the college course you wish you'd taken, learning from acclaimed historians and writers, alongside Slate 's Jamelle Bouie and Rebecca Onion.\n\nAs in the Pays d'en Haut, so in the American South, where the demand for Indian slaves changed the political relationships between tribes. \"Once Europeans showed up and they demanded that the supply of Native slaves amp up to meet the demand, Native practices regarding slaves changed,\" Snyder said. \"So people who might once have been adopted or killed now became slaves.\"\n\nCaptives experienced enslavement by 17 th -century Europeans in a much different way than enslavement by another Indian tribe. If a Native person was made captive by a rival tribe, a set of relatively predictable traditions governed his or her treatment. But after a Native captor sold a captive to a European, the person was swept into a global system. She, or he, was now a commodity. In the South, Snyder said, \"[Natives] basically became slaves in a really similar way to African slaves, who were also arriving at the same time in South Carolina.\" Reduced to a source of labor, and caught up in a wide-reaching web of exchange, the Native slave could be sold very far away. Rushforth points to instances of Apaches and other Plains peoples being sold, through Quebec, to the Caribbean. \"There were Plains Apaches who showed up on sugar plantations in Martinique,\" he said.\n\nWhile the histories of Native enslavement and enslaving might seem to be separate spheres of study, they too are intertwined. Tribal groups could find themselves shifting from enslavers to enslaved, as their relationships to Euro-Americans, and with other tribes, changed over time. To illustrate this concept, Snyder points to the story of the Westo Indians , a group originally from around Lake Erie, who spoke an Iroquoian language. They left the North in the middle of the 17 th century, Snyder says, \"probably because of Iroquois competition over guns and slaving,\" and moved to the Southeast, where they enslaved local Indians for sale to colonists. \"But then the colonists got anxious, or they were afraid that this group was too powerful,\" Snyder said; in 1680, a group of Carolinians armed the Savannah Indians and empowered them to break the Westos' strength in the area. The remaining Westos were, themselves, sold to the Caribbean as slaves.\n\n* * *\n\nIn the late-18 th -century Southeast, the Native relationship to slavery took a surprising turn. There, a relatively small group of Cherokees, Creeks, Choctaws, and Chickasaws held Africans in bondage. Historian Tiya Miles has written two histories of Cherokee slaveholding. Miles places the number of enslaved people held by Cherokees at around 600 at the start of the 19 th century and around 1,500 at the time of westward removal in 1838-9. (Creeks, Choctaws, and Chickasaws, she said, held around 3,500 slaves, across the three nations, as the 19 th century began.) \"Slavery inched its way slowly into Cherokee life,\" Miles told me. \"When a white man moved into a Native location, usually to work as a trader or as an Indian agent, he would own [African] slaves.\" If such a person also had a child with a Native woman, as was not uncommon, the half-European, half-Native child would inherit the enslaved people (and their children) under white law, as well as the right to use tribal lands under tribal law. This combination put such people in a position to expand their wealth, eventually operating large farms and plantations. This was the story of James Vann, the father of Joseph, the steamboat owner; the elder Vann's mother was Cherokee, while his father was white.\n\nApaches and other Plains peoples were sold, through Quebec, to the Caribbean.\n\nIn the second and third decades of the 19 th century, the Cherokee strategy to keep the American government from taking their land was to prove their own sovereignty as a \"civilized\" people. They were trying, Miles said, \"to form a Cherokee government that looked like the U.S. government, to publish laws, establish a Supreme Court, establish a principal city, to create a police force, to create a newspaper.\" These efforts were concurrent with the growth of slavery, another adopted tradition that would show that Cherokees were truly assimilating.\n\nPhoto illustration by Lisa Larson-Walker. Photos via Library of Congress & Wikimedia Commons.\n\nThe United States government-Congress considered itself in charge of Indian affairs and, starting in the 1780s , established a series of governmental structures meant to manage tribal relations-\"had really clear ideas about what it meant to be civilized,\" Miles said. \"That included a different gendered differentiation of labor, so men were supposed to stop hunting; they were supposed to come back and farm. Women were supposed to be in the household. And enslaved people were supposed to be out in those fields, helping to produce even more crops and eventually allowing the native man to have more of a supervisory role.\" Indian agents-white men appointed by Congress to liaise with the tribes-would report to their supervisors on the degree to which Cherokee slaveholders were fulfilling the expectations of white observers. Some white onlookers thought James Vann far too lenient in the way he socialized with the (by one count) 70 enslaved Africans who worked on his plantation. Still, he prospered, eventually owning 400 to 800 acres of land, a store, a tavern, and a trading post.\n\nThe material success of slaveholders such as Vann did not, in the end, save the Cherokees from removal. While some Native slaveowners in the South may have been \"temporarily enriched\" by slaveholding, historian Claudio Saunt argues , \"as the demand for captives rose, it destabilized the entire region. The dehumanization of non-Europeans ultimately allowed white colonists to justify the killing of Southeastern Indians and the appropriation of their lands.\" The explicitly racist underpinnings of slavery in the South left Native people there, even slaveholders who participated in the system, vulnerable. When white demand for land prevailed, the Native population would inevitably lose.\n\nDuring removal, some wealthy Cherokees were able to take their enslaved people along. Many walked the Trail of Tears, along with the Natives who held them in bondage. \"If you were rich in the Southeast, you got to basically start over again with a captive labor force,\" Miles said. \"Which doesn't mean that removal wasn't awful; it was still awful. But it meant that you had a leg up in rebuilding your wealth.\"\n\nSlave narratives-there are Works Progress Administration oral histories given by black slaves who were once owned by Cherokees and other tribes-report favorably on the experience of being held by Natives. Miles told me that she thought the historian should take these narratives with a grain of salt, pointing out that there are also many stories of Native slaveholders selling or punishing their black bondsmen. \"There were more ways to have a margin of autonomy in Native American contexts. There are examples of Native people freeing their slaves and marrying them,\" she said. \"But at the same time there are many instances of very violent behavior that tended to take place on the larger plantations. ... So it depended on where you were enslaved and who you were enslaved by.\" Some Native people who held Africans on small farms, where they might \"eat out of the same pot as the master\" (as Miles put it), treated them as a kind of family. In her first book, however, Miles wrote about a Cherokee farmer who enslaved an African woman, lived with her for decades, and never freed her, despite her bearing his children. In that particular case, years of intimacy did not lead to emancipation.\n\n* * *\n\nThe historians I spoke with said that they found this history challenging to talk about in moral terms-perhaps more so than the history of African slavery. \"I think popular history likes to talk about good guys and bad guys,\" Snyder told me. The complexities of the history of Native enslavement leave such clear distinctions behind. \"Some may think that I do not philosophize enough,\" Alan Gallay writes in the introduction to his book, \"that I have the responsibility of always separating good from evil, of creating a parable from which the moral of the story may easily be drawn. I wish that it were so simple.\"\n\nThe fact that Native people so often assisted in the enslavement of people from other tribes makes this story a complicated one. Yes, Europeans did have Native assistance in implementing their ends; they were also the ones who put Native tribes under the existential pressures that forced many Indians to sell fellow Natives into slavery. This tragedy does not make for so clear-cut a narrative as, say, the bravery of the fugitive African Americans who took the Underground Railroad to freedom. Yet it is a tragedy nonetheless.\n\nThe many stories of Native slavery force us to think about the strategies Native people used to respond to the relentless European desire for labor. Some, like the Yamasee-who, with their allies, rose up to challenge British colonists in South Carolina in 1715-16 -fought enslavement with violent resistance. Some, like the warriors who brought the long coffle of Sioux to Montreal in 1741, or the Cherokee, Creek, Chickasaw, and Choctaw who took their African slaves to Indian Country in the 1830s, tried to adapt by becoming part of the system.\n\nLater, some worked within European law to challenge a tradition of Indian enslavement. In 1739, a Native man known only as \"Caesar\" sued for his own freedom in New London, Connecticut. He argued that his mother, Betty, who had surrendered during King Philip's War in 1676, should have been set free after 10 years of servitude, rather than enslaved, and that he himself should have been born a free man. More than a few second- and third-generation Native slaves brought such cases in New England in the 1730s and 1740s, and in so doing, writes Margaret Ellen Newell, they fueled New England's growing abolitionism, forcing men in power to reconsider the legal basis for enslavement. Natives were thus part of the history of American slavery at its beginning, and at its end.\n\n* * *\n\nFurther Reading\n\nNew England:\n\nMargaret Ellen Newell: Brethren by Nature: New England Indians, Colonists, and the Origins of American Slavery\n\nThe Southwest:\n\nJames F.

      "text": "Why Do So Many Americans Think They Have Cherokee Blood?\n\nPhoto courtesy Carol M. Highsmith/ Library of Congress\n\n\"I cannot say when I first heard of my Indian blood, but as a boy I heard it spoken of in a general way,\" Charles Phelps, a resident of Winston-Salem in North Carolina, told a federal census taker near the beginning of the 20 th century. Like many Americans at the time, Phelps had a vague understanding of his Native American ancestry. On one point, however, his memory seemed curiously specific: His Indian identity was a product of his \"Cherokee blood.\"\n\nThe tradition of claiming a Cherokee ancestor continues into the present. Today, more Americans claim descent from at least one Cherokee ancestor than any other Native American group. Across the United States, Americans tell and retell stories of long-lost Cherokee ancestors. These tales of family genealogies become murkier with each passing generation, but like Phelps, contemporary Americans profess their belief despite not being able to point directly to a Cherokee in their family tree.\n\nRecent demographic data reveals the extent to which Americans believe they're part Cherokee. In 2000, the federal census reported that 729,533 Americans self-identified as Cherokee. By 2010, that number increased, with the Census Bureau reporting that 819,105 Americans claimed at least one Cherokee ancestor. Census data also indicates that the vast majority of people self-identifying as Cherokee-almost 70 percent of respondents-claim they are mixed-race Cherokees.\n\nWhy do so many Americans claim to possess \"Cherokee blood\"? The answer requires us to peel back the layers of Cherokee history and tradition.\n\nMost scholars agree that the Cherokees, an Iroquoian-speaking people, have lived in what is today the Southeastern United States-Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, North and South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama-since at least A.D. 1000. When Europeans first encountered the Cherokees in the mid-16 th century, Cherokee people had well-established social and cultural traditions. Cherokee people lived in small towns and belonged to one of seven matrilineal clans. Cherokee women enjoyed great political and social power in the Cherokee society. Not only did a child inherit the clan identity of his or her mother, women oversaw the adoption of captives and other outsiders into the responsibilities of clan membership.\n\nAs European colonialism engulfed Cherokee Country during the 17 th and 18 th centuries, however, Cherokees began altering their social and cultural traditions to better meet the challenges of their times. One important tradition that adapted to new realities was marriage.\n\nThe Cherokee tradition of exogamous marriage, or marrying outside of one's clan, evolved during the 17 th and 18 th centuries as Cherokees encountered Europeans on a more frequent basis. Some sought to solidify alliances with Europeans through intermarriage.\n\nIt is impossible to know the exact number of Cherokees who married Europeans during this period. But we know that Cherokees viewed intermarriage as both a diplomatic tool and as a means of incorporating Europeans into the reciprocal bonds of kinship. Eighteenth-century British traders often sought out Cherokee wives. For the trader, the marriage opened up new markets, with his Cherokee wife providing both companionship and entry access to items such as the deerskins coveted by Europeans. For Cherokees, intermarriage made it possible to secure reliable flows of European goods, such as metal and iron tools, guns, and clothing. The frequency with which the British reported interracial marriages among the Cherokees testifies to the sexual autonomy and political influence that Cherokee women enjoyed. It also gave rise to a mixed-race Cherokee population that appears to have been far larger than the racially mixed populations of neighboring tribes.\n\nEuropeans were not the only group of outsiders with which 18 th -century Cherokees intermingled. By the early 19 th century, a small group of wealthy Cherokees adopted racial slavery, acquiring black slaves from American slave markets. A bit more than 7 percent of Cherokee families owned slaves by the mid-1830s; a small number, but enough to give rise to a now pervasive idea in black culture: descent from a Cherokee ancestor.\n\nIn the early 20 th century, the descendants of Cherokee slaves related stories of how their black forebears accompanied Cherokees on the forced removals of the 1830s. They also recalled tales of how African and Cherokee people created interracial families. These stories have persisted into the 21 st century. The former NFL running back Emmitt Smith believed that he had \"Cherokee blood.\" After submitting a DNA test as part of his 2010 appearance on NBC's Who Do You Think You Are , he learned he was mistaken. Among black Americans, as among Americans as a whole, the belief in Cherokee ancestry is more common than actual blood ties.\n\nSlaves owned by Cherokees did join their owners when the federal government forced some 17,000 Cherokees from their Southeastern homeland at the end of the 1830s. Cherokee people and their slaves endured that forced journey into the West by riverboats and overland paths, joining tens of thousands of previously displaced Native peoples from the Eastern United States in Indian Territory (modern-day eastern Oklahoma). We now refer to this inglorious event as the Trail of Tears.\n\nBut the Cherokee people did not remain confined to the lands that the federal government assigned to them in Indian Territory. During the late 19 th and early 20 th centuries, Cherokees traveled between Indian Territory and North Carolina to visit family and friends, and Cherokee people migrated and resettled throughout North America in search of social and economic opportunities. While many Native American groups traveled throughout the United States during this period in search of employment, the Cherokee people's advanced levels of education and literacy-a product of the Cherokee Nation's public education system in Indian Territory and the willingness of diaspora Cherokees to enroll their children in formal educational institutions-meant they traveled on a scale far larger than any other indigenous group. In these travels it's possible to glimpse Cherokees coming into contact with, living next door to, or intermarrying with white and black Americans from all walks of life.\n\nAt the same time that the Cherokee diaspora was expanding across the country, the federal government began adopting a system of \"blood quantum\" to determine Native American identity. Native Americans were required to prove their Cherokee, or Navajo, or Sioux \"blood\" in order to be recognized. (The racially based system of identification also excluded individuals with \"one drop\" of \"Negro blood.\") The federal government's \"blood quantum\" standards varied over time, helping to explain why recorded Cherokee \"blood quantum\" ranged from \"full-blood\" to one 2048 th . The system's larger aim was to determine who was eligible for land allotments following the government's decision to terminate Native American self-government at the end of the 19 th century. By 1934, the year that Franklin Roosevelt's administration adopted the Indian Reorganization Act, \"blood quantum\" became the official measure by which the federal government determined Native American identity.\n\nIn the ensuing decades, Cherokees, like other Native American groups, sought to define \"blood\" on their own terms. By the mid-20 th century, Cherokee and other American Indian activists began joining together to articulate their definitions of American Indian identity and to confront those tens of thousands of Americans who laid claim to being descendants of Native Americans.\n\nGroups such as the National Congress of American Indians worked toward the self-determination of American Indian nations and also tackled the problem of false claims to membership. According to the work of Vine Deloria, one of NCAI's leading intellectuals, \"Cherokee was the most popular tribe\" in America. \"From Maine to Washington State,\" Deloria recalled, white Americans insisted they were descended from Cherokee ancestors. More often than not, that ancestor was an \"Indian princess,\" despite the fact that the tribe never had a social system with anything resembling an inherited title like princess .\n\nSo why have so many Americans laid claim to a clearly fictional identity? Part of the answer is embedded in the tribe's history: its willingness to incorporate outsiders into kinship systems and its wide-ranging migrations throughout North America. But there's another explanation, too.\n\nThe Cherokees resisted state and federal efforts to remove them from their Southeastern homelands during the 1820s and 1830s. During that time, most whites saw them as an inconvenient nuisance, an obstacle to colonial expansion. But after their removal, the tribe came to be viewed more romantically, especially in the antebellum South, where their determination to maintain their rights of self-government against the federal government took on new meaning. Throughout the South in the 1840s and 1850s, large numbers of whites began claiming they were descended from a Cherokee great-grandmother. That great-grandmother was often a \"princess,\" a not-inconsequential detail in a region obsessed with social status and suspicious of outsiders. By claiming a royal Cherokee ancestor, white Southerners were legitimating the antiquity of their native-born status as sons or daughters of the South, as well as establishing their determination to defend their rights against an aggressive federal government, as they imagined the Cherokees had done. These may have been self-serving historical delusions, but they have proven to be enduring.\n\nThe continuing popularity of claiming \"Cherokee blood\" and the ease with which millions of Americans inhabit a Cherokee identity speaks volumes about the enduring legacy of American colonialism. Shifting one's identity to claim ownership of an imagined Cherokee past is at once a way to authenticate your American-ness and absolve yourself of complicity in the crimes Americans committed against the tribe across history.\n\nThat said, the visibility of Cherokee identity also owes much to the success of the three federally recognized Cherokee tribes. Today, the Cherokee Nation, the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians, and the Eastern Band of Cherokees comprise a combined population of 344,700. Cherokee tribal governments provide community members with health services, education, and housing assistance; they have even teamed up with companies such as Google and Apple to produce Cherokee-language apps. Most Cherokees live in close-knit communities in eastern Oklahoma or the Great Smoky Mountains in North Carolina, but a considerable number live throughout North America and in cities such as New York, Chicago, San Francisco, and Toronto. Cherokee people are doctors and lawyers, schoolteachers and academics, tradespeople and minimum-wage workers. The cultural richness, political visibility, and socioeconomic diversity of the Cherokee people have played a considerable role in keeping the tribe's identity in the historical consciousness of generation after generation of Americans, whether or not they have Cherokee blood.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Back to the Frontier\n\nI saw Kevin Costner's Horizon: An American Saga-Chapter 1 at a movie theater that puts together a \"preshow\" of clips and reels related to the feature film content. Thursday night, this show included previews of 1962's How the West Was Won , a John Ford film starring Jimmy Stewart, John Wayne, Gregory Peck, and Henry Fonda. This was followed by Westward the Women , a 1951 film with the tagline \"Never underestimate the will of a woman when there is a wedding ring in sight.\" And then there was 1972's Buck and the Preacher , the story of a wagon master and a con man who help Black migrants survive their journey to the West, starring Sidney Poitier, Harry Belafonte, and Ruby Dee, and directed by Poitier.\n\nInitially, I thought these choices made for the perfect setup for Horizon . Here were three \"classic\" Westerns, each with a different take on the history of the American West. One is an epic of interlocking narratives spanning 50 years and starring a host of Hollywood icons. The second is a film that-despite the sexism of its tagline-highlights the diverse backgrounds and experiences of women in the West. And the third is a movie that makes it clear that not all American pioneers were white.\n\nAs I settled in for Costner's three-hour passion project , I hoped it would prove a compelling successor to these films, and to his own Dances With Wolves (1990) and Open Range (2003). And that Horizon would have rich and complex characters and a storyline that would change many viewers' ideas of what a \"Western\" could be. That the Indigenous men and women in the movie would leap off the screen, fully realized people with complicated emotions and motives. And that the film would pass journalist David Treuer's slightly adapted version of the famous Bechdel test , with \"at least two Native characters who talk to each other about something other than white people, or what it means to be Indian, or what the government has done to us.\"\n\nBut alas.\n\nThe film begins with a white surveyor and his son laying out stakes along a riverbank, in the shadow of towering red cliffs, while another man waves from a tent. We are informed that this place is the San Pedro Valley, in 1859. At that time, this valley was the center of Apachería, a vast region of mountains, river valleys, canyons, and high desert that had been the homeland of many Apache bands for more than eight centuries. In the 16 th century, Spanish and then Mexican colonists claimed the area, and in 1821, Mexico declared its independence and the valley became part of the territory of Nuevo México. In 1854, the United States brought it into the Union as part of the Gadsden Purchase. By the late 1850s, U.S. surveyors had not yet parceled out these lands, and Mexican land grant claimants had abandoned the area. To the Apaches who lived there, these paper boundaries did not matter. In 1859, this surveyor and his son would have been trespassers on both Native and federal land.\n\nTwo Apache boys surveil them while they work, and they are soon joined by a war party. Soon, Americans are dead. A wandering Catholic missionary finds their bodies and buries them. The crosses that mark their graves appear during the film multiple times, indicating the passage of time and reminding the viewer that here we are, once again, in the nascent town of Horizon .\n\nThese initial scenes give us a sense of how important family-and fathers and sons in particular-will be to Horizon 's narrative. Over the course of the film, we see father-son relationships in an Apache camp, a burning house under attack, and a Montana cabin. These characters are often separated, and many of them die, as conflicts over Western lands take an enormous toll on families in multiple communities. The opening segment of Horizon also indicates how violent the interactions between Apache peoples and American settler colonists will be.\n\nA few years after that first survey, another group of white migrants has arrived in the San Pedro Valley. It is unclear where they have come from and why, but they have erected a tent city with a large dance hall at its center. This is the first fully populated iteration of the town of Horizon.\n\nAs the settlers eat, drink, and dance one evening, an Apache war party approaches in the dark. They attack the dance and kill dozens of men, women, and children, setting fire to the entire town. Several warriors move on to a house that sits on a hill, the home of the Kittredge family. As that structure burns, only Frances Kittredge (Sienna Miller) and her daughter Elizabeth (Georgia MacPhail) survive. The next morning, a U.S. Army detachment arrives. They help the survivors bury the dead and then take in the settlers who want protection.\n\nThis fictional act of violence is accurate in terms of its strategy (Apache peoples often attacked at night and used fire to their advantage), but not in terms of scope or severity. By this time, Chiricahua Apaches had been at war with American civilians and soldiers for two years. In the summer and fall of 1861, to give an example, Chiricahuas attacked a party of miners from Tubac who were fleeing to the safety of federal forts along the Rio Grande, and the mining town of Piños Altos. They took large herds of horses from these Americans but killed only five or six people. This was typical of Indigenous fighting styles in the region; Chiricahuas only attacked when they had a significant advantage of numbers and favored quick strikes rather than massed charges.\n\nIn the film, Apache warriors are determined to defend their territory against white interlopers, although it is U.S. Army officers (played by an expressionless Sam Worthington and a morose Danny Huston) who articulate the Apaches' motivations most clearly to the audience. Here, Costner is again walking the path he trod in Dances With Wolves . In that film, viewers see Indigenous people mostly through the eyes and the diary writing of a white U.S. soldier who has fled the Eastern battlefields of the Civil War to see the frontier \"before it's gone.\"\n\nCostner has stated in several interviews that he wanted to depict white migration from an Indigenous point of view in Horizon and give the film's Native characters individuality and dignity. Instead, we see small bands of undifferentiated Indigenous peoples. They are identified as Apaches, but from which bands? Why had they split into peace and war factions? Who is the elder who speaks for peace in the wake of the attack on Horizon? We do not have any answers to these questions, because Costner does not give his Indigenous characters (or any of his characters, really) backstories. We only see them as they confront white migration during the American Civil War and fight among themselves in response.\n\nThe reality is that in the 1850s and 1860s, the American West-from the northern Rockies to the southwestern deserts-was dominated by Indigenous peoples who had long been in contact with white people. In both areas, Indigenous peoples had faced large American migrant streams moving through their territories as part of the Mormon migration to Utah (1847), the California gold rush (1849), and the Colorado gold rush (1858-59).\n\nSome bands of \"fighting men\" did break off from larger tribal nations during this period, but others had always exercised autonomy in their trade and warfare relationships. And during the 1860s, many Indigenous peoples formed alliances with one another. There was a major surge in violent encounters between American civilians and soldiers and Apache, Navajo, Kiowa, Comanche, Cheyenne, Arapaho, Lakota, Dakota, and Blackfoot peoples, as the latter asserted their sovereignty.\n\nDuring this period, men like Geronimo, Cochise, and Victorio (Chiricahua Apache), Crazy Horse (Oglala Lakota), and Sitting Bull (Hunkpapa Lakota) emerged as powerful diplomats and war leaders in their communities. In January 1863, after U.S. troops murdered the legendary chief Mangas Coloradas near a copper mining camp in New Mexico Territory, Chiricahua leaders initiated a war with the U.S. government that would last until the 1880s. Indigenous acts of resistance in this moment also put Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull on the road to the 1876 Battle of Greasy Grass (Little Bighorn).\n\nThis history of encounter and resistance, in other words, was geographically expansive and central to what happened in the West in the middle of the 19 th century. But Indigenous peoples are almost completely absent from the Montana, Wyoming, and Santa Fe Trail narratives of the movie. Horizon takes place in many locations, but Indigenous people seem only to exist in the San Pedro Valley, and in small numbers. In interviews , Costner has repeated that the dominant emotion he wants to show in the Apache engagement with Americans is befuddlement.\n\n\"They are confused by the giant population that continues to roll toward them,\" he told David Remnick of the New Yorker , \"and they think of it as unbelievable.\"\n\nBut at the time this movie is set, Indigenous peoples across the West already understood the power of the United States, and its massive population. In the wake of Lewis and Clark's expedition in the first decade of the 19 th century, tribes regularly sent delegations to D.C., who reported back on the sights they had seen in America's towns and cities. They had trade networks that extended across the continent, and they shared information with their kin and allies. The spectacle of confusion and shock may suit Costner better, but that's just not how it was.\n\nHollywood has never been particularly good at depicting Native Americans in film. In the first Westerns of the 1940s and 1950s (like those in the preshow previews at my theater), they were the enemies who rode across beautiful landscapes intent on killing and sexually assaulting white pioneers. The revisionist Westerns that followed either erased Indigenous peoples completely (instead slotting in banks and corrupt law enforcement as the big bads) or refigured them as noble, stoic emblems of suffering. As in Dances With Wolves , Costner does cast Indigenous actors in Horizon , and they speak Native languages. They are agents of change. But the dominant focus is still on white protagonists and their emotional and physical journeys, even when they share scenes with often unnamed Indigenous, Mexican, and Chinese Westerners. For Costner, the \"we\" of Horizon is always white. \"We threw their lives into chaos,\" he tells Remnick when describing the Apache narrative in the film.\n\nYes, Costner, like most other writers and directors of Westerns, makes mainstream films for white men. I would love to see a Western set in the 19 th century, written and directed by Sterlin Harjo, who created the critically acclaimed series Reservation Dogs (with Māori New Zealander Taika Waititi) for FX. A film focused on Indigenous Westerners who have emotionally resonant relationships with friends and family, and complex motivations. A film with a sense of play, where the intimate details of everyday life are sometimes tragic, sometimes delightful. What a joy it would be to watch a vivid and compelling depiction of the real West, and the people who brought it into being.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "\n\nPortrait of Pocahontas. Painting by William Sheppard. Photo illustration by Juliana JimÃ©nez Jaramillo. Image courtesy Library of Congress\n\nIt's so nice to be needed even after you're dead. That's what I was thinking during the rehearsal dinner for Pocahontas and John Rolfe at the Williamsburg Lodge, off Route 60 in Virginia.\n\nPhoto courtesy Preservation Virginia (Historic Jamestowne)\n\nIn 1614, Rolfe, a tobacco farmer and recent widower, needed Pocahontas, the object of his obsession, for, well, sex. Chief Powhatan needed Pocahontas, his daughter, to wed this English colonist to secure Powhatan's sovereignty over his chiefdom. Years after Pocahontas' death, former Jamestown leader Capt. John Smith needed the Indian princess's legend to secure his own fame. During the Colonial era and beyond, Virginian and British families used their genealogical connection to her to claim highborn heritage, and after the Civil War, the local Indian community used her to protect itself from deeply racist Jim Crow laws. Historic Jamestowne needs her today to promote tourism. And as I learned from the current chief of Pocahontas' tribe, the Pamunkey still need her to protect fishing rights and help secure federal recognition.\n\nPocahontas had shellfish embroidered on her wedding jacket, which was modeled on a garment from the era in London's Victoria and Albert Museum. According to a volunteer embroiderer at my table, it took 70 volunteers (including former Virginia first lady Roxane Gilmore) 55 days to stitch 130 pretty black creatures, including rabbits, deer, and crabs.\n\nHer jacket worked a lot better than John Rolfe's red suit, which, while historically accurate, looked disco-ish even topped by an oversized black hat.\n\nThe event would have resembled any generic upscale hotel wedding rehearsal dinner if it weren't for the three Native American men on a dais wearing tanned buckskin and draped in raccoon mantles, their skin covered by red and blue body paint.\n\nThe next day's wedding re-enactment was to be held at the base of the original mud-walled chapel where Pocahontas wed John Rolfe on April 5, 1614-400 years later to the date. The site of the settlement's chapel was found just in 2010 at Historic Jamestowne . Its perimeter exactly matched dimensions described by William Strachey, secretary of the first English colony in the New World. The discovery was acclaimed as one of Archaeology magazine's top 10 finds of the year.\n\n(To clear up a common misconception for those who live outside Virginia-four out of five college graduates I polled in an East Village Starbucks got this wrong-Capt. John Smith, leader of the Jamestown settlement, who claimed Pocahontas saved him by begging her father to release him moments before certain death, was never married to Pocahontas. He left Jamestown after being injured by a gunpowder explosion, never to return. Farmer John Rolfe departed England in 1609 on the third supply fleet headed to the struggling English colony. After a short stint as a castaway in Bermuda, he arrived in Jamestown in 1610 and married Pocahontas four years later.)\n\nI wasn't out of place in a room full of Pocahontas enthusiasts. I was the girl who dressed up for Halloween in a fringe dress and braids telling everyone I was an Indian princess. My favorite picture book was Pocahontas: A Little Indian Girl of Jamestown , which described Capt. John Smith as a handsome \"Paleface\" hero \"straight and tall\" with hair \"the color of gold leaves in the autumn, his eyes like the sky.\" Smith told Pocahontas stories and gave her prized gifts, such as a hand mirror. She in turn walked through the forest to warn the captain that her tribe would kill him while he slept. I took out every children's book about Pocahontas I could find in the library and questioned my mother, who as a girl had also dreamed of being Pocahontas. I was sure Smith loved his little friend back, but she was born too late. She obviously married the wrong man, and did so only because she was told the right one was dead. When she lived in England as the new Lady Rolfe, she saw Smith once, and what a tragedy that must have been! If only he had waited for her to grow up to marry him.\n\nIn 2005 I couldn't wait to see Terrence Malick's visually sumptuous (if a bit plotless) two-and-a-half-hour film about Pocahontas and the Jamestown colonists. I could convince absolutely no one to go with me.\n\nWhen I read about the wedding re-enactment, I'd been especially intrigued that a member of Pocahontas' Pamunkey tribe had been chosen to portray her. Had the local Native Americans really signed off on this event? I decided I had to attend.\n\nOnce again no one wanted to accompany me to a Pocahontas event, not even my 11-year-old daughter, who said she was slightly embarrassed for me. I made the triumphal announcement to my family that I was going alone. \"Bring me back a T-shirt,\" my daughter said without looking up from Instagram.\n\nIt was easy enough to get to the wedding, a straight eight-hour train ride from New York's Penn Station to Williamsburg, Virginia. There was a free shuttle bus from the 18 th -century Colonial Williamsburg to 17 th -century Jamestown, 15 minutes away. But how was I going to get an indigenous perspective unfiltered by pomp and press releases?\n\nIt was simpler than I thought. Wandering around the grounds of Colonial Williamsburg, the first person I spoke with was Jeff Brown, an archaeologist digging by a slope near a cobblestone street. \"You have to call my brother Kevin, I swear, he's the current chief of the Pamunkey tribe.\"\n\n\"I am the chief,\" Kevin Brown said firmly over the phone, and added that he would have plenty to say on the wedding matter.\n\nWith the clomping of horses in the background, I made arrangements to meet him the next day in the upstairs bookstore café at the College of William & Mary. \"Look for a man with a beaded pendant on his neck.\" Then he gently advised me, \"You really don't have to keep saying 'Native American' in Virginia. We use the word 'Indian' here. Or we just name the tribe.\"\n\nThe oldest Virginia families claim descent from Pocahontas.\n\nI didn't want to be uninformed going to an unexpected meeting with a tribal chief, so I quickly read up on the unusual status of Indian tribes in Virginia. In 1924 an astonishing law was passed called the Racial Integrity Act that restricted who could marry based on race. Anyone with a hint of black ancestry was considered black and prohibited from marrying a white person. But according to a subsection of the law known as the Pocahontas Exception, since the oldest Virginia families claimed descent from Pocahontas, a person with one-sixteenth Indian blood was considered white.\n\nThe law protected Native Americans somewhat from Jim Crow laws. But the long-term unintended effect of classifying people with Native American ancestry as white is what Laura Feller, a curator for the National Park Service and the foremost expert on this ugly asterisk of history, has termed \"administrative genocide.\" It has left \"a modern-day legacy where today's Virginia tribes struggle to achieve federal recognition because they cannot prove their heritage through historic documentation.\"\n\nChief Kevin Brown was indeed sporting a colorful pendant the next day over his light blue oxford shirt and vest; his head was shaved bald except for a short black ponytail. \"The marriage has never been a big story to our community,\" he said. \"A lot of little girls lived then who wed white men. Many other chiefs ruled beneath Powhatan, who used his children as a way to secure allegiances. He had as many as 50 daughters, and Pocahontas was not of as high a station as some of the other girls were. He had a child of his living at almost every tribal community, and viewed Jamestown as another opportunity to secure influence. Influence was currency back then.\"\n\nImage courtesy Library of Congress\n\nBrown made intimidatingly direct eye contact. \"I've anguished over this weekend, but the Pocahontas connection helps our fight for federal recognition,\" he said. The tribe is already recognized by the state of Virginia, and it is on track to be the first federally recognized Virginian tribe sometime in 2014. With that designation comes enormous economic potential.\n\nThe Pamunkey are one of the many related tribes classified as Algonquian. In 1607, when the English arrived, about 20,000 local Algonquian-speaking Indians called Powhatan (after their leader, Pocahontas' father) lived near the Virginia coast. Of these Indians, about 1,000 of them were Pamunkey. About 160 European settlers lived in the village of Jamestown. Today there are 205 Pamunkey, and 50 people live on the 1,200-acre reservation in King William, about 40 miles away from Historic Jamestown on the banks of the Pamunkey River. It was set aside by treaty in 1646 and given to the tribe in 1658. On the reservation is a burial mound thought to hold Powhatan's remains.\n\n\"We did talk to trees,\" Brown said of the Disney film Pocahontas , \"but the rest of the story is BS. Disney came to our reservation for research. I don't think anyone got any money. We didn't. Honestly, I'm going tonight for the meal, and I'm a little pissed the big rehearsal dinner's not an open bar.\"\n\nâIâve anguished over this weekend, but the Pocahontas connection helps our fight for federal recognition.â\n\nHe worried his reply was too frank, but I reassured him I wanted the truth, and then he smiled warmly. \"I'm trying . I really am. If I can use these things as a platform to get out that my tribe's fishing rights are under attack, I'll go along with it. The Pamunkey and the Mattaponi have always had exemption to fish shad and catfish, and now the Department of Game and Inland Fisheries wants to curb our rights.\" He explained that they signed a treaty for these rights in 1677, and tribal fishermen always carry cards that identify them as Pamunkey. \"They say the shad is overfished and there's mercury danger, but these are our rights by treaty.\"\n\nThe Pamunkey, he said, have run a shad hatchery since 1918. Along with the Mattaponi tribe, the Pamunkey have worked to increase fertilization by 60 percent by taking the female fish and squeezing their roe into pails and then catching a male fish and adding his sperm.\n\n\"So if people look at our participation this weekend like 'What a bunch of sellouts!' they are not seeing the big picture. If you want justice to work, you have to be at the table. Four or five years ago, we got more involved with the events produced through Colonial Williamsburg. Before that no one particularly recognized or appreciated our existence, but they are starting to. That's why I said yes.\"\n\nPocahontas was born about 1595 in Werowocomoco, 15 miles upriver from Jamestown. She was about 11 when she met 27-year-old Smith. Smith's account is the primary historical record of her childhood, but it is so strewn with inconsistencies that, as historian Camilla Townsend hypothesizes, most of his thrilling account of a girl begging her father to save a white man was a spin on Indian maiden sexual fantasies popular at the time.\n\nPainting by Sidney E. King/National Park Service\n\nBut no Jamestown experts have disputed that the most famous marriage in American history took place. The first church-sanctioned interracial marriage in English-speaking North America was huge news on both sides of the Atlantic. And it ushered in a seven-year period of peace and unity between the colonists and Indians before renewed war.\n\nApparently I was the first of 120 guests for the rehearsal dinner; when the doorman opened the entrance for me, he asked if I was going to the Edwards/Carlisle wedding.\n\nI explained why I was there.\n\n\"Oh dear, I forgot Miss Pocahontas is getting married tomorrow. The Rolfe party is in the Colony Room, down the hall to your left.\"\n\nFew regular visitors to Colonial Williamsburg had bought a ticket, at $95 a seat. Over cocktails I met loyal staff, wealthy board members of Colonial Williamsburg, and local \"Pocahontas descendants\" who identified as white and Protestant. For 400 years, American bluebloods in the thousands have claimed direct descent from Pocahontas via her son, Thomas Rolfe, and his daughter Jane. There were the Byrds, a family of famous explorers and governors, New York City's handsome former Mayor John Lindsay, Woodrow Wilson's wife Edith, mathematician and astronomer Percival Lowell (who thought he found canals on Mars), and Nancy Reagan, who favors astrology over astronomy. In England there are scores of additional fancy folks proudly touting Pocahontas lineage through Thomas' other daughter, Anne.\n\nPhoto courtesy Preservation Virginia (Historic Jamestowne)\n\nThree Jamestown colonist re-enactors entered the room accompanied by the three Indians in buckskins and body paint.\n\nThen swarthy John Rolfe arrived with his comely bride-to-be, her hair bunned and tucked into a bonnet.\n\nA man acting the part of the colony's Anglican minister Richard Bucke led us in a severe 17 th -century form of grace, and everyone in the room bowed their heads. Oy. Was I the only secular Jew there? Did no one care that \"Bucke\" was an actor? After another culture-shocked glance around the room, I bowed my head, too.\n\nBetween each dish served, the historic interpreters on the dais gave a few lines of scripted dialogue. One maid was a composite of the English women who tended to Pocahontas after she became Lady Rolfe.\n\nThe menu, starting with cornmeal-crusted oyster chowder, was purported to be what could have been served in 1614, but there was no bottle-nosed dolphin served, nor shark, whale, turtle, snake, heron, eagle, crow, skunk, dog, horse, or cat.\n\nWas Chief Brown suffering? I squinted over to his table, and it was hard to tell. Toward the end of my sweet potato tart dessert, I strolled over to say hi, and he introduced me to his good friend, Robert \"Two Eagles\" Green, a former insurance executive and chief emeritus of Virginia's Patawomeck tribe, who portrayed Pocahontas' father, Powhatan, in an episode of PBS's Nova .\n\nItâs been a strange time for archaeologists at Jamestown.\n\nBrown then presented me to Buck Woodard, a ponytailed anthropologist with a charismatic George Clooney smile. When I'd spoken with Brown at the bookstore, he said that he decided to come to the weekend's festivities in part because Woodard \"asked me to participate, and I trust him and listen to him.\"\n\n\"The two tables of Indians here are my guests,\" Woodard said. \"Of course they didn't pay to come. I'm honored that they did come.\" Woodard is an adjunct professor at Virginia Commonwealth University's School of World Studies and director of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation's and Historic Jamestowne's American Indian Initiative. \"The dinner was a tough sell,\" Woodard confessed.\n\nA clamorous crush of well-wishers started seeking to have their pictures taken with the famous couple. Woodard and I agreed to talk more at the wedding the next morning.\n\nBefore entering the old coastal fort, I signed the wedding guest book. After making sure I didn't see any of the Indians I had been talking to at the rehearsal dinner, I asked another tourist to take a photo of me touching Pocahontas' hand for good luck. As a child I'd seen pictures of this 1922 life-size statue by the fort's entrance, sculpted by William Ordway Partridge. As an adult I could see how it might offend: This beauty with a feather in her hair has European features as in a Degas ballerina sculpture, and she wears clothing from a Western tribe. The iconic statue is copper-green, with both hands rubbed to a shine from so many people superstitiously touching them. The governor of Virginia presented a replica in 1958 at St. George's Church in Gravesend, England, where Pocahontas died in March 1617, after being left off a ship with what was probably tuberculosis. She had just finished a year abroad with her husband, including a formal presentation to the royal court as the baptized Lady Rebecca Rolfe. She is buried under the chancel in Gravesend, where the important locals were placed after death, and her remains have never been disturbed or studied.\n\nI bought a southerly sweet tea inside the small standalone cafeteria and added a $1.25 slice of white-frosted \"Pocahontas wedding cake\" to stay festive.\n\nIn a blue short-sleeved work shirt, archaeologist David Givens talked to passersby from the cellar of the fort, where he was busy unearthing a brick bread oven. Watching archaeologists work on site is part of the Jamestown attraction. A clutch of wedding guests crammed near me to take photos of Givens.\n\nPainting by Sidney E. King/Image courtesy National Park Service\n\nIt's been a strange time for archaeologists at Jamestown. Just over a year ago, Smithsonian scientists announced that they had discovered the partial skull and severed shinbone of \"Jane,\" a 14-year-old girl, near the Jamestown chapel. The bones bore the marks of an inexperienced butcher. These mangled human parts were direct evidence of cannibalism during the harsh winter of 1609-1610, referred to as the Starving Time. The announcement brought on a media storm and rare mentions of dismemberment on TripAdvisor.\n\nGivens told the tourists, all the while sifting soil, about the discovery of half-eaten Jane. Another thing archaeologists there have shown is that what masters eat, servants eat. \"Archaeologists and scientists see a lot of lead poisoning; both masters and servants were eating off the same pewter plates.\"\n\nAfter answering a few more enthusiastic cannibalism questions from the dozen or so visitors standing above him and passing time before the ceremony, Givens tried to describe his other work, dropping words like mitochondrial and isotopic signatures . After a polite silence, it was back to more cannibalism questions.\n\n\"The softer expression for cannibalism is processing to be eaten ,\" he said resignedly.\n\nBuck Woodard waved me over to continue our truncated rehearsal dinner conversation. He cast the Indians in the weekend's events. He's done a lot of film work, mainly as an adviser along with Chief Robert \"Two Eagles\" Green, and he had the know-how to do the makeup for the Indian characters.\n\nPhoto courtesy Preservation Virginia (Historic Jamestowne)\n\nWoodard worked with Native American actress Irene Bedard, who was the voice of Pocahontas in the Disney Pocahontas film and its sequel, Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World . He worked with Q'orianka Kilcher as Pocahontas in the grown-up movie The New World . Was he a fixer on set? \"Emmanuel Lubezki, who was nominated for an Oscar as cinematographer for New World \"-he won for Gravity -\"called me an animateur , and I like that better than fixer. It's French for the person who makes things comes alive, makes things happen.\"\n\nI complimented him on his lapel pin (\"Iroquois League\") and his snazzy purple jacket. \"Not purple, wampum-colored.\" I was so nervous that I would get the Indian perspective wrong that I double-checked if he was being humorous. \"Sort of, but wampum and belts were used in diplomatic ceremonies. But think how much of the humor of the Indians participating in the original ceremony may have been lost. I imagine the newcomers transcribed seriously. Indians can be ironic too, ya know. If only we had a linguist working on the subtleties.\"\n\n\"Isn't there?\"\n\n\"Nope, nobody's meaningfully working on Virginian Algonquian since Blair Rudes died.\" I was embarrassed that I had no idea who he was talking about. \"An astonishing linguist who worked on The New World . I'm proud that in this ceremony, which is for the dominant culture, there is substantive and meaningful use of Pamunkey words, which Rudes helped bring back from the dead.\" Some of the words we know for sure originated from the Powhatan language are raccoon , opossum , pecan , moccasin , hickory , persimmon , terrapin , tomahawk , and wow ! \"As in powwow ,\" he explained when I questioned the last one.\n\nSo how many authentic words would be used in the ceremony a few minutes away?\n\nWoodard knew: \"Twelve. Mostly during a native blessing in which John Rolfe and his bride's hands will be linked and wrapped with beads by Pocahontas' uncle Opichisco. But sometimes 12 is not 12. Algonquian phrases are polysynthetic and build like German, so one big, long word can be descriptive of people and place; one Pamunkey word would be many more in English.\"\n\n\"I see my real job as an ombudsman of the local Indian voice,\" Woodard said. \"And as far as this weekend goes, Pocahontas is the most famous person in the story, and if we need her to get a level playing field in a dominant culture, then so be it. Just look over at those benches. Twenty Pamunkey Indians are in the fort of Jamestowne, and you tell me, when's the last time that happened? In the 17 th century? I'm not trying to sugarcoat the compromises being made this weekend, but their very presence here is a big deal in post-Colonial American history.\"\n\nWe stopped talking after two musicians appeared onstage to serenade the audience by viola da gamba and recorder.\n\nA VIP area was roped off along the 24-by-64-foot footprint of the old chapel, a few dozen of us seated inside it, the not-so-fortunate standing outside of it, four deep. In the front left rows, the honored Pamunkey guests fanned themselves with their programs while reporters and photographers from Indian Country Today and the Washington Post snapped photos of a smiling former governor of Virginia.\n\nAs the British flag flapped above us, the fanciful procession down the center aisle began, first gallant guards from the fort carrying rifles, then two priests, and then Capt. Samuel Argall , a man of influence at Jamestown. Now the Indian party arrived, the same Native American actors from the rehearsal dinner.\n\nAt first sight of the bride, the smartphones came out. Wendy Taylor, with her rich brown hair glimmering in the sun and a smashing Disney hourglass figure, was undeniably the embodiment of all little-girl and grown-man fantasies of Pocahontas. The Pocahontas fangirls around me gasped and grabbed their parents' hands to steady themselves at her arrival.\n\nI was secretly ashamed that I shared their excitement.\n\nYet Pocahontas had but one line: \"I will.\"\n\nâArgall was a jerk. Iâm glad thatâs coming across.â\n\nCouldn't the writing staff have added to this? Maybe they were purists. What we know about the ceremony comes from an account by Ralph Hamor, the Jamestown secretary who succeeded William Strachey, and there was no account by Pocahontas. It is wishful thinking that she would have said more.\n\nOne thing the children's books and most Pocahontas myths fail to mention, a fact that sucks some of the romance out of the occasion, is that Pocahontas was kidnapped before the wedding. In April 1613, Capt. Argall captured Pocahontas in the town of Passapatanzy, where she had been calling on relatives. She was held prisoner at the town of Henricus for a year, had Christianity lessons, and was baptized Rebecca. (Whether or not she used the name, she almost certainly ceased being known as Pocahontas, which was a nickname. Her childhood given name was either Amonute or Matoaka; she let it be known around the time of her wedding that she preferred to be called Matoaka.)\n\nIt is clear from diaries and records that Rolfe was infatuated with Pocahontas, but zero evidence exists that she shared an emotional connection. It is possible that she agreed to marry the widower as one of the terms of her release.\n\nCapt. Argall, wearing a wireless microphone, laughed arrogantly to his comrade in a stagy aside. \"She was traded for a small copper pot!\"\n\nImage courtesy Meg Eastman/Virginia Historical Society\n\nA history enthusiast behind me behind me said to his son: \"Argall was a jerk. I'm glad that's coming across.\"\n\nAfter the ceremony, the newlyweds were escorted to the much-needed shade of a craft services holding tent.\n\nA dignified lady seated next to me asked if I'd enjoyed the 20-minute ceremony. She turned out to be Anne Geddy Cross of Hanover, Virginia, president of the Board of Trustees of Preservation Virginia. Cross oversees the site as well as five core historic properties. I assumed she got to meet Queen Elizabeth II in 2007 when she visited for another historical marker, the quadricentennial of the first settlers' arrival. \"I did indeed! Royalty loves to visit Virginia.\" But she claimed to be more over the moon that Indian royalty was here this time. \" That's truly something!\"\n\nI remembered that souvenir for my daughter when I saw the T-shirt options fluttering in the hot breeze in an outdoor popup shop alongside the James River. One showed Rolfe kneeling by Pocahontas, asking for her hand, with a cringe-worthy scratched heart in a tree that read \"Pocahontas + J. Rolfe, 4*5*14.\" *\n\nHere I ran into Bill Bolling and his son Sean Bolling, also buying T-shirts. Mrs. Bolling (I never caught her first name) emerged from the tent, saying she'd brought along a chart prepared by an ancestor, Blair Bolling, in 1810 that explained that her husband and son were \"red Bollings,\" who have the most assured heritage from Pocahontas; others identified by genealogists as \"blue Bollings\" and \"white Bollings\" have iffy links.\n\n\"Got that correctly?\" she asked hopefully.\n\nAccording to Bill Bolling, his family also has a tradition of naming daughters Pocahontas, and Bill recently found the grave of an ancestor named Pocahontas Bolling. He was thrilled to be at the wedding: \"I'm pretty humbled. This is the same site it all happened on. I'm taking it all in.\"\n\nDespite misgivings, I bought the shirt with the kneeling Rolfe. I was almost ready to leave when I realized in horror I had not gotten Pocahontas' perspective from Pocahontas.\n\nPhoto courtesy Chuck Durfor\n\nBuck Woodard agreed to introduce me to 25-year-old Wendy Taylor (Chief Brown's cousin), but only after she had had a decent break. As I waited in the tent, my eyes roved to John Rolfe (actor David Catanese) in his red suit and 17 th -century hat sneaking a Tastykake powdered sugar donut from the craft services table. I reached for my iPhone to document this, and he gave me a thumbs-up, then the bride was ready to say hello.\n\nWoodard stood nearby, perhaps to make sure I was asking respectful questions. \"I saw the movie Pocahontas I can't even count how many times. I was always pretending to be her. I love being her,\" said Taylor. Woodard looked like he was disappointed that Taylor's excitement in being cast stemmed from watching a vamped-up maiden in Disney cartoons. But then he put in, \"Now that she has a 4-year-old and a 9-month-old, she's watching it again.\"\n\nI was startled and excited to find out that the silver-haired man next to me listening to our conversation was the most famous man at the fort, the archeologist who insisted more than 20 years ago that the fort had not washed away, that its traces could still be found along the James River. Oh my! I had just read his book on the train. Could I interview him, too?\n\nWilliam Kelso happily started in with the story he has told countless times. \"I began by myself, 20 acres started by shovel, I then noticed a dark streak in the soil. Man, I was beside myself! Right away I found an object, and we have since found 1.7 million other objects.\" None of this would be happening if not for his vision-not the archaeological research, not the World of Pocahontas Unearthed exhibit that opened June 6 at the Jamestown site, not the wedding re-enactment.\n\nâIâll fall in my last hole here, probably.â\n\n\"It is something, isn't it, for it's on the genuine site? It's a lovely day, but meeting the Queen, that was my best moment,\" he said. In 2007, Kelso was made Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire.\n\n\"I was told the Queen wanted a reflective moment, so I racked my brains for something good to say to her. When I met her, I spent 20 minutes with her guiding her around in her blue coat and blue hat. There was a lot to catch up on since her 1957 visit to the fort. She loved all of it, and I whispered, 'Your majesty, this is where the British Empire began, this was not just the first American colony, this was the first colony in the British Empire.' \" He chortled. \"She loved that bit of information, she gave the best smile and incorporated that tidbit into her speech. Bush was there, too, you know, but making the Queen smile. That was wild .\"\n\nKelso pointed to where he lives year-round, a building on site, in a caretaker's house provided by Preservation Virginia. \"That's why I can be here so often. I'm waiting on what the future still holds. Hopefully my career highlight is still ahead. Did anyone tell you work started a few days ago on the western end of the island, 20 unexplored acres? It took us 20 years to dig one acre. So think about that, one acre, 95 percent of the site is uncovered. There is years of work ahead. I'll fall in my last hole here, probably. I'm too excited to stop.\"\n\nOn the Amtrak ride home, I worried that I would, like so many before me, convince myself that I deeply understood a complicated history after a glimpsing visit. My reported journey to Jamestown will be hopelessly outdated in 50 years, like all of the accounts I have read, starting with the ones by the settlers at Jamestown who had a late-medieval perspective and offered the world a Christians vs. savages account. Their \"good Indian woman who saved the life of a white man\" tale is spectacularly loved even today. In other accounts, Pocahontas has been portrayed as a brat at Jamestown; she has been called powerless, and even matter-of-factly a prick-tease. The divide in interpreting her story is not just between cultures; in academic circles, there are still factions with brittle pride warring over whether Pocahontas really saved John Smith from death, whether he made the story up, or whether the narrative was about a ritual drama John Smith simply didn't understand. Some experts argue about the appropriation of Pocahontas as an American Indian woman that the larger public has reduced to a \"Pocahottie\" Halloween outfit. None of these tropes is centered within a firm Algonquian indigenous worldview, perhaps an almost impossible task 400 years later. Divergent takes on historical events will not always be reconciled.\n\nBut even if I went to Jamestown and all my daughter got was a lousy T-shirt, I have gotten so much more out of the pilgrimage.\n\nTop Comment\n\nReally enjoyed this article, as an anthropologist who has done recent research on tourism and the depiction of an imaginary historical past.

A selection of his images appears in a new volume, For a Love of His People: The Photography of Horace Poolaw , which accompanies the National Museum of the American Indian's exhibition of the same name . (A few more Poolaw photos can be seen on the NMAI's website .)\n\nWhile many non-Indian photographers of the American West in the 19th and early 20th centuries made images of Native Americans with a variety of goals in mind (commercial exploitation; anthropological preservation; artistic production), Native photographers also stepped behind the camera to document their own communities. Among them, Poolaw left behind an exceptionally complete archive, which represents 20th-century Native life in Oklahoma as a fluid mix of traditional and modern cultures.\n\n\"Poolaw kept his pictures close,\" historian Martha Sandweiss writes in a preface to the volume. He tended to produce images for their subjects only, selling some souvenir copies at fairs and gatherings, but not to \"government publications or illustrated magazines.\" As a result, the images feel personal and intimate.\n\nThe scholars that worked on the exhibition unearthed many family stories to go along with the recovered negatives. They're still trying to identify some of the people in the images; the NMAI would be happy to receive any relevant information.\n\n© 2014 Estate of Horace Poolaw.\n\nHorace Poolaw's eldest son Jerry Poolaw (Kiowa), Mountain View, Oklahoma, ca. 1929.\n\n© 2014 Estate of Horace Poolaw.\n\nJerry Poolaw (Kiowa), on leave from duty in the Navy, Anadarko, Okla., ca. 1944.\n\n© 2014 Estate of Horace Poolaw.\n\nHorace Poolaw (Kiowa), aerial photographer, and Gus Palmer (Kiowa), side gunner, inside a B-17 Flying Fortress, Tampa, Fla., ca. 1944.\n\nDuring World War II, Poolaw served three years in the U.S. Army Air Forces as an instructor in aerial photography.

While there, she met Danielle SeeWalker, an enrolled member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe . The two became fast friends and kept in touch when Cardana left the U.S. Fifteen years later, during a meeting in London, they began to talk about the American Indian culture and how it was often misrepresented or ignored in the media. They set out to create a project that gave voice to an often-silenced population through Cardana's images and SeeWalker's words in the ongoing work \" The Red Road Project .\"\n\nThey began by photographing and interviewing SeeWalker's relatives, since they found it difficult to meet strangers willing to participate. Many people weren't certain what to make about the project. \"[The Native community] have suspicions toward everyone who works in the media and everyone who is not Native,\" Cardana said. \"They weren't really trusting us.\"\n\nCarlotta Cardana/The Red Road Project\n\nCarlotta Cardana/The Red Road Project\n\nCarlotta Cardana/The Red Road Project\n\nThe more people they included in the project, the more word began to spread on social media, adding some weight to their project and slowly convincing other people that their intentions were positive. Still, another obstacle they faced was to convince people about the importance of visibility.\n\n\"They're very humble and they believe in humility and can't handle putting themselves in that light,\" Cardana said. \"We said, 'You're doing important things and people need to know so other Natives can be inspired.' They want the best for their community, and they see our project as an opportunity to tell their side of the story.\"\n\nCarlotta Cardana/The Red Road Project\n\nThe point of the project is to provide a space that allows people to speak freely about their experiences, so Cardana, an experienced editorial photographer used to working with limited time and location options, has her subjects pick what they want to wear and where they want to be photographed.\n\n\"I feel like if I were the one deciding where to do the pictures, it would be untruthful,\" she said. \"I wasn't interested in making a super nice photo with a nice background; I was interesting in having an environment that adds to the story, that tells you what's important for them.\"\n\nCardana and SeeWalker hope to continue making work around the country (they're spending November in Nebraska and December in California). Eventually, they'd like to create a project that also includes archival images and artwork created by Native Americans.\n\n\"We want to tell people about Native Americans and also to tell Natives about other Natives doing great stuff, as in inspiration,\" she said. \"To go back into the community and be an inspiration.\"\n\nCarlotta Cardana/The Red Road Project\n\nCarlotta Cardana/The Red Road Project\n\nCarlotta Cardana/The Red Road Project\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "\n\nPortrait of Pocahontas. Painting by William Sheppard. Photo illustration by Juliana JimÃ©nez Jaramillo. Image courtesy Library of Congress\n\nIt's so nice to be needed even after you're dead. That's what I was thinking during the rehearsal dinner for Pocahontas and John Rolfe at the Williamsburg Lodge, off Route 60 in Virginia.\n\nPhoto courtesy Preservation Virginia (Historic Jamestowne)\n\nIn 1614, Rolfe, a tobacco farmer and recent widower, needed Pocahontas, the object of his obsession, for, well, sex. Chief Powhatan needed Pocahontas, his daughter, to wed this English colonist to secure Powhatan's sovereignty over his chiefdom. Years after Pocahontas' death, former Jamestown leader Capt. John Smith needed the Indian princess's legend to secure his own fame. During the Colonial era and beyond, Virginian and British families used their genealogical connection to her to claim highborn heritage, and after the Civil War, the local Indian community used her to protect itself from deeply racist Jim Crow laws. Historic Jamestowne needs her today to promote tourism. And as I learned from the current chief of Pocahontas' tribe, the Pamunkey still need her to protect fishing rights and help secure federal recognition.\n\nPocahontas had shellfish embroidered on her wedding jacket, which was modeled on a garment from the era in London's Victoria and Albert Museum. According to a volunteer embroiderer at my table, it took 70 volunteers (including former Virginia first lady Roxane Gilmore) 55 days to stitch 130 pretty black creatures, including rabbits, deer, and crabs.\n\nHer jacket worked a lot better than John Rolfe's red suit, which, while historically accurate, looked disco-ish even topped by an oversized black hat.\n\nThe event would have resembled any generic upscale hotel wedding rehearsal dinner if it weren't for the three Native American men on a dais wearing tanned buckskin and draped in raccoon mantles, their skin covered by red and blue body paint.\n\nThe next day's wedding re-enactment was to be held at the base of the original mud-walled chapel where Pocahontas wed John Rolfe on April 5, 1614-400 years later to the date. The site of the settlement's chapel was found just in 2010 at Historic Jamestowne . Its perimeter exactly matched dimensions described by William Strachey, secretary of the first English colony in the New World. The discovery was acclaimed as one of Archaeology magazine's top 10 finds of the year.\n\n(To clear up a common misconception for those who live outside Virginia-four out of five college graduates I polled in an East Village Starbucks got this wrong-Capt. John Smith, leader of the Jamestown settlement, who claimed Pocahontas saved him by begging her father to release him moments before certain death, was never married to Pocahontas. He left Jamestown after being injured by a gunpowder explosion, never to return. Farmer John Rolfe departed England in 1609 on the third supply fleet headed to the struggling English colony. After a short stint as a castaway in Bermuda, he arrived in Jamestown in 1610 and married Pocahontas four years later.)\n\nI wasn't out of place in a room full of Pocahontas enthusiasts. I was the girl who dressed up for Halloween in a fringe dress and braids telling everyone I was an Indian princess. My favorite picture book was Pocahontas: A Little Indian Girl of Jamestown , which described Capt. John Smith as a handsome \"Paleface\" hero \"straight and tall\" with hair \"the color of gold leaves in the autumn, his eyes like the sky.\" Smith told Pocahontas stories and gave her prized gifts, such as a hand mirror. She in turn walked through the forest to warn the captain that her tribe would kill him while he slept. I took out every children's book about Pocahontas I could find in the library and questioned my mother, who as a girl had also dreamed of being Pocahontas. I was sure Smith loved his little friend back, but she was born too late. She obviously married the wrong man, and did so only because she was told the right one was dead. When she lived in England as the new Lady Rolfe, she saw Smith once, and what a tragedy that must have been! If only he had waited for her to grow up to marry him.\n\nIn 2005 I couldn't wait to see Terrence Malick's visually sumptuous (if a bit plotless) two-and-a-half-hour film about Pocahontas and the Jamestown colonists. I could convince absolutely no one to go with me.\n\nWhen I read about the wedding re-enactment, I'd been especially intrigued that a member of Pocahontas' Pamunkey tribe had been chosen to portray her. Had the local Native Americans really signed off on this event? I decided I had to attend.\n\nOnce again no one wanted to accompany me to a Pocahontas event, not even my 11-year-old daughter, who said she was slightly embarrassed for me. I made the triumphal announcement to my family that I was going alone. \"Bring me back a T-shirt,\" my daughter said without looking up from Instagram.\n\nIt was easy enough to get to the wedding, a straight eight-hour train ride from New York's Penn Station to Williamsburg, Virginia. There was a free shuttle bus from the 18 th -century Colonial Williamsburg to 17 th -century Jamestown, 15 minutes away. But how was I going to get an indigenous perspective unfiltered by pomp and press releases?\n\nIt was simpler than I thought. Wandering around the grounds of Colonial Williamsburg, the first person I spoke with was Jeff Brown, an archaeologist digging by a slope near a cobblestone street. \"You have to call my brother Kevin, I swear, he's the current chief of the Pamunkey tribe.\"\n\n\"I am the chief,\" Kevin Brown said firmly over the phone, and added that he would have plenty to say on the wedding matter.\n\nWith the clomping of horses in the background, I made arrangements to meet him the next day in the upstairs bookstore café at the College of William & Mary. \"Look for a man with a beaded pendant on his neck.\" Then he gently advised me, \"You really don't have to keep saying 'Native American' in Virginia. We use the word 'Indian' here. Or we just name the tribe.\"\n\nThe oldest Virginia families claim descent from Pocahontas.\n\nI didn't want to be uninformed going to an unexpected meeting with a tribal chief, so I quickly read up on the unusual status of Indian tribes in Virginia. In 1924 an astonishing law was passed called the Racial Integrity Act that restricted who could marry based on race. Anyone with a hint of black ancestry was considered black and prohibited from marrying a white person. But according to a subsection of the law known as the Pocahontas Exception, since the oldest Virginia families claimed descent from Pocahontas, a person with one-sixteenth Indian blood was considered white.\n\nThe law protected Native Americans somewhat from Jim Crow laws. But the long-term unintended effect of classifying people with Native American ancestry as white is what Laura Feller, a curator for the National Park Service and the foremost expert on this ugly asterisk of history, has termed \"administrative genocide.\" It has left \"a modern-day legacy where today's Virginia tribes struggle to achieve federal recognition because they cannot prove their heritage through historic documentation.\"\n\nChief Kevin Brown was indeed sporting a colorful pendant the next day over his light blue oxford shirt and vest; his head was shaved bald except for a short black ponytail. \"The marriage has never been a big story to our community,\" he said. \"A lot of little girls lived then who wed white men. Many other chiefs ruled beneath Powhatan, who used his children as a way to secure allegiances. He had as many as 50 daughters, and Pocahontas was not of as high a station as some of the other girls were. He had a child of his living at almost every tribal community, and viewed Jamestown as another opportunity to secure influence. Influence was currency back then.\"\n\nImage courtesy Library of Congress\n\nBrown made intimidatingly direct eye contact. \"I've anguished over this weekend, but the Pocahontas connection helps our fight for federal recognition,\" he said. The tribe is already recognized by the state of Virginia, and it is on track to be the first federally recognized Virginian tribe sometime in 2014. With that designation comes enormous economic potential.\n\nThe Pamunkey are one of the many related tribes classified as Algonquian. In 1607, when the English arrived, about 20,000 local Algonquian-speaking Indians called Powhatan (after their leader, Pocahontas' father) lived near the Virginia coast. Of these Indians, about 1,000 of them were Pamunkey. About 160 European settlers lived in the village of Jamestown. Today there are 205 Pamunkey, and 50 people live on the 1,200-acre reservation in King William, about 40 miles away from Historic Jamestown on the banks of the Pamunkey River. It was set aside by treaty in 1646 and given to the tribe in 1658. On the reservation is a burial mound thought to hold Powhatan's remains.\n\n\"We did talk to trees,\" Brown said of the Disney film Pocahontas , \"but the rest of the story is BS. Disney came to our reservation for research. I don't think anyone got any money. We didn't. Honestly, I'm going tonight for the meal, and I'm a little pissed the big rehearsal dinner's not an open bar.\"\n\nâIâve anguished over this weekend, but the Pocahontas connection helps our fight for federal recognition.â\n\nHe worried his reply was too frank, but I reassured him I wanted the truth, and then he smiled warmly. \"I'm trying . I really am. If I can use these things as a platform to get out that my tribe's fishing rights are under attack, I'll go along with it. The Pamunkey and the Mattaponi have always had exemption to fish shad and catfish, and now the Department of Game and Inland Fisheries wants to curb our rights.\" He explained that they signed a treaty for these rights in 1677, and tribal fishermen always carry cards that identify them as Pamunkey. \"They say the shad is overfished and there's mercury danger, but these are our rights by treaty.\"\n\nThe Pamunkey, he said, have run a shad hatchery since 1918. Along with the Mattaponi tribe, the Pamunkey have worked to increase fertilization by 60 percent by taking the female fish and squeezing their roe into pails and then catching a male fish and adding his sperm.\n\n\"So if people look at our participation this weekend like 'What a bunch of sellouts!' they are not seeing the big picture. If you want justice to work, you have to be at the table. Four or five years ago, we got more involved with the events produced through Colonial Williamsburg. Before that no one particularly recognized or appreciated our existence, but they are starting to. That's why I said yes.\"\n\nPocahontas was born about 1595 in Werowocomoco, 15 miles upriver from Jamestown. She was about 11 when she met 27-year-old Smith. Smith's account is the primary historical record of her childhood, but it is so strewn with inconsistencies that, as historian Camilla Townsend hypothesizes, most of his thrilling account of a girl begging her father to save a white man was a spin on Indian maiden sexual fantasies popular at the time.\n\nPainting by Sidney E. King/National Park Service\n\nBut no Jamestown experts have disputed that the most famous marriage in American history took place. The first church-sanctioned interracial marriage in English-speaking North America was huge news on both sides of the Atlantic. And it ushered in a seven-year period of peace and unity between the colonists and Indians before renewed war.\n\nApparently I was the first of 120 guests for the rehearsal dinner; when the doorman opened the entrance for me, he asked if I was going to the Edwards/Carlisle wedding.\n\nI explained why I was there.\n\n\"Oh dear, I forgot Miss Pocahontas is getting married tomorrow. The Rolfe party is in the Colony Room, down the hall to your left.\"\n\nFew regular visitors to Colonial Williamsburg had bought a ticket, at $95 a seat. Over cocktails I met loyal staff, wealthy board members of Colonial Williamsburg, and local \"Pocahontas descendants\" who identified as white and Protestant. For 400 years, American bluebloods in the thousands have claimed direct descent from Pocahontas via her son, Thomas Rolfe, and his daughter Jane. There were the Byrds, a family of famous explorers and governors, New York City's handsome former Mayor John Lindsay, Woodrow Wilson's wife Edith, mathematician and astronomer Percival Lowell (who thought he found canals on Mars), and Nancy Reagan, who favors astrology over astronomy. In England there are scores of additional fancy folks proudly touting Pocahontas lineage through Thomas' other daughter, Anne.\n\nPhoto courtesy Preservation Virginia (Historic Jamestowne)\n\nThree Jamestown colonist re-enactors entered the room accompanied by the three Indians in buckskins and body paint.\n\nThen swarthy John Rolfe arrived with his comely bride-to-be, her hair bunned and tucked into a bonnet.\n\nA man acting the part of the colony's Anglican minister Richard Bucke led us in a severe 17 th -century form of grace, and everyone in the room bowed their heads. Oy. Was I the only secular Jew there? Did no one care that \"Bucke\" was an actor? After another culture-shocked glance around the room, I bowed my head, too.\n\nBetween each dish served, the historic interpreters on the dais gave a few lines of scripted dialogue. One maid was a composite of the English women who tended to Pocahontas after she became Lady Rolfe.\n\nThe menu, starting with cornmeal-crusted oyster chowder, was purported to be what could have been served in 1614, but there was no bottle-nosed dolphin served, nor shark, whale, turtle, snake, heron, eagle, crow, skunk, dog, horse, or cat.\n\nWas Chief Brown suffering? I squinted over to his table, and it was hard to tell. Toward the end of my sweet potato tart dessert, I strolled over to say hi, and he introduced me to his good friend, Robert \"Two Eagles\" Green, a former insurance executive and chief emeritus of Virginia's Patawomeck tribe, who portrayed Pocahontas' father, Powhatan, in an episode of PBS's Nova .\n\nItâs been a strange time for archaeologists at Jamestown.\n\nBrown then presented me to Buck Woodard, a ponytailed anthropologist with a charismatic George Clooney smile. When I'd spoken with Brown at the bookstore, he said that he decided to come to the weekend's festivities in part because Woodard \"asked me to participate, and I trust him and listen to him.\"\n\n\"The two tables of Indians here are my guests,\" Woodard said. \"Of course they didn't pay to come. I'm honored that they did come.\" Woodard is an adjunct professor at Virginia Commonwealth University's School of World Studies and director of the Colonial Williamsburg Foundation's and Historic Jamestowne's American Indian Initiative. \"The dinner was a tough sell,\" Woodard confessed.\n\nA clamorous crush of well-wishers started seeking to have their pictures taken with the famous couple. Woodard and I agreed to talk more at the wedding the next morning.\n\nBefore entering the old coastal fort, I signed the wedding guest book. After making sure I didn't see any of the Indians I had been talking to at the rehearsal dinner, I asked another tourist to take a photo of me touching Pocahontas' hand for good luck. As a child I'd seen pictures of this 1922 life-size statue by the fort's entrance, sculpted by William Ordway Partridge. As an adult I could see how it might offend: This beauty with a feather in her hair has European features as in a Degas ballerina sculpture, and she wears clothing from a Western tribe. The iconic statue is copper-green, with both hands rubbed to a shine from so many people superstitiously touching them. The governor of Virginia presented a replica in 1958 at St. George's Church in Gravesend, England, where Pocahontas died in March 1617, after being left off a ship with what was probably tuberculosis. She had just finished a year abroad with her husband, including a formal presentation to the royal court as the baptized Lady Rebecca Rolfe. She is buried under the chancel in Gravesend, where the important locals were placed after death, and her remains have never been disturbed or studied.\n\nI bought a southerly sweet tea inside the small standalone cafeteria and added a $1.25 slice of white-frosted \"Pocahontas wedding cake\" to stay festive.\n\nIn a blue short-sleeved work shirt, archaeologist David Givens talked to passersby from the cellar of the fort, where he was busy unearthing a brick bread oven. Watching archaeologists work on site is part of the Jamestown attraction. A clutch of wedding guests crammed near me to take photos of Givens.\n\nPainting by Sidney E. King/Image courtesy National Park Service\n\nIt's been a strange time for archaeologists at Jamestown. Just over a year ago, Smithsonian scientists announced that they had discovered the partial skull and severed shinbone of \"Jane,\" a 14-year-old girl, near the Jamestown chapel. The bones bore the marks of an inexperienced butcher. These mangled human parts were direct evidence of cannibalism during the harsh winter of 1609-1610, referred to as the Starving Time. The announcement brought on a media storm and rare mentions of dismemberment on TripAdvisor.\n\nGivens told the tourists, all the while sifting soil, about the discovery of half-eaten Jane. Another thing archaeologists there have shown is that what masters eat, servants eat. \"Archaeologists and scientists see a lot of lead poisoning; both masters and servants were eating off the same pewter plates.\"\n\nAfter answering a few more enthusiastic cannibalism questions from the dozen or so visitors standing above him and passing time before the ceremony, Givens tried to describe his other work, dropping words like mitochondrial and isotopic signatures . After a polite silence, it was back to more cannibalism questions.\n\n\"The softer expression for cannibalism is processing to be eaten ,\" he said resignedly.\n\nBuck Woodard waved me over to continue our truncated rehearsal dinner conversation. He cast the Indians in the weekend's events. He's done a lot of film work, mainly as an adviser along with Chief Robert \"Two Eagles\" Green, and he had the know-how to do the makeup for the Indian characters.\n\nPhoto courtesy Preservation Virginia (Historic Jamestowne)\n\nWoodard worked with Native American actress Irene Bedard, who was the voice of Pocahontas in the Disney Pocahontas film and its sequel, Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World . He worked with Q'orianka Kilcher as Pocahontas in the grown-up movie The New World . Was he a fixer on set? \"Emmanuel Lubezki, who was nominated for an Oscar as cinematographer for New World \"-he won for Gravity -\"called me an animateur , and I like that better than fixer. It's French for the person who makes things comes alive, makes things happen.\"\n\nI complimented him on his lapel pin (\"Iroquois League\") and his snazzy purple jacket. \"Not purple, wampum-colored.\" I was so nervous that I would get the Indian perspective wrong that I double-checked if he was being humorous. \"Sort of, but wampum and belts were used in diplomatic ceremonies. But think how much of the humor of the Indians participating in the original ceremony may have been lost. I imagine the newcomers transcribed seriously. Indians can be ironic too, ya know. If only we had a linguist working on the subtleties.\"\n\n\"Isn't there?\"\n\n\"Nope, nobody's meaningfully working on Virginian Algonquian since Blair Rudes died.\" I was embarrassed that I had no idea who he was talking about. \"An astonishing linguist who worked on The New World . I'm proud that in this ceremony, which is for the dominant culture, there is substantive and meaningful use of Pamunkey words, which Rudes helped bring back from the dead.\" Some of the words we know for sure originated from the Powhatan language are raccoon , opossum , pecan , moccasin , hickory , persimmon , terrapin , tomahawk , and wow ! \"As in powwow ,\" he explained when I questioned the last one.\n\nSo how many authentic words would be used in the ceremony a few minutes away?\n\nWoodard knew: \"Twelve. Mostly during a native blessing in which John Rolfe and his bride's hands will be linked and wrapped with beads by Pocahontas' uncle Opichisco. But sometimes 12 is not 12. Algonquian phrases are polysynthetic and build like German, so one big, long word can be descriptive of people and place; one Pamunkey word would be many more in English.\"\n\n\"I see my real job as an ombudsman of the local Indian voice,\" Woodard said. \"And as far as this weekend goes, Pocahontas is the most famous person in the story, and if we need her to get a level playing field in a dominant culture, then so be it. Just look over at those benches. Twenty Pamunkey Indians are in the fort of Jamestowne, and you tell me, when's the last time that happened? In the 17 th century? I'm not trying to sugarcoat the compromises being made this weekend, but their very presence here is a big deal in post-Colonial American history.\"\n\nWe stopped talking after two musicians appeared onstage to serenade the audience by viola da gamba and recorder.\n\nA VIP area was roped off along the 24-by-64-foot footprint of the old chapel, a few dozen of us seated inside it, the not-so-fortunate standing outside of it, four deep. In the front left rows, the honored Pamunkey guests fanned themselves with their programs while reporters and photographers from Indian Country Today and the Washington Post snapped photos of a smiling former governor of Virginia.\n\nAs the British flag flapped above us, the fanciful procession down the center aisle began, first gallant guards from the fort carrying rifles, then two priests, and then Capt. Samuel Argall , a man of influence at Jamestown. Now the Indian party arrived, the same Native American actors from the rehearsal dinner.\n\nAt first sight of the bride, the smartphones came out. Wendy Taylor, with her rich brown hair glimmering in the sun and a smashing Disney hourglass figure, was undeniably the embodiment of all little-girl and grown-man fantasies of Pocahontas. The Pocahontas fangirls around me gasped and grabbed their parents' hands to steady themselves at her arrival.\n\nI was secretly ashamed that I shared their excitement.\n\nYet Pocahontas had but one line: \"I will.\"\n\nâArgall was a jerk. Iâm glad thatâs coming across.â\n\nCouldn't the writing staff have added to this? Maybe they were purists. What we know about the ceremony comes from an account by Ralph Hamor, the Jamestown secretary who succeeded William Strachey, and there was no account by Pocahontas. It is wishful thinking that she would have said more.\n\nOne thing the children's books and most Pocahontas myths fail to mention, a fact that sucks some of the romance out of the occasion, is that Pocahontas was kidnapped before the wedding. In April 1613, Capt. Argall captured Pocahontas in the town of Passapatanzy, where she had been calling on relatives. She was held prisoner at the town of Henricus for a year, had Christianity lessons, and was baptized Rebecca. (Whether or not she used the name, she almost certainly ceased being known as Pocahontas, which was a nickname. Her childhood given name was either Amonute or Matoaka; she let it be known around the time of her wedding that she preferred to be called Matoaka.)\n\nIt is clear from diaries and records that Rolfe was infatuated with Pocahontas, but zero evidence exists that she shared an emotional connection. It is possible that she agreed to marry the widower as one of the terms of her release.\n\nCapt. Argall, wearing a wireless microphone, laughed arrogantly to his comrade in a stagy aside. \"She was traded for a small copper pot!\"\n\nImage courtesy Meg Eastman/Virginia Historical Society\n\nA history enthusiast behind me behind me said to his son: \"Argall was a jerk. I'm glad that's coming across.\"\n\nAfter the ceremony, the newlyweds were escorted to the much-needed shade of a craft services holding tent.\n\nA dignified lady seated next to me asked if I'd enjoyed the 20-minute ceremony. She turned out to be Anne Geddy Cross of Hanover, Virginia, president of the Board of Trustees of Preservation Virginia. Cross oversees the site as well as five core historic properties. I assumed she got to meet Queen Elizabeth II in 2007 when she visited for another historical marker, the quadricentennial of the first settlers' arrival. \"I did indeed! Royalty loves to visit Virginia.\" But she claimed to be more over the moon that Indian royalty was here this time. \" That's truly something!\"\n\nI remembered that souvenir for my daughter when I saw the T-shirt options fluttering in the hot breeze in an outdoor popup shop alongside the James River. One showed Rolfe kneeling by Pocahontas, asking for her hand, with a cringe-worthy scratched heart in a tree that read \"Pocahontas + J. Rolfe, 4*5*14.\" *\n\nHere I ran into Bill Bolling and his son Sean Bolling, also buying T-shirts. Mrs. Bolling (I never caught her first name) emerged from the tent, saying she'd brought along a chart prepared by an ancestor, Blair Bolling, in 1810 that explained that her husband and son were \"red Bollings,\" who have the most assured heritage from Pocahontas; others identified by genealogists as \"blue Bollings\" and \"white Bollings\" have iffy links.\n\n\"Got that correctly?\" she asked hopefully.\n\nAccording to Bill Bolling, his family also has a tradition of naming daughters Pocahontas, and Bill recently found the grave of an ancestor named Pocahontas Bolling. He was thrilled to be at the wedding: \"I'm pretty humbled. This is the same site it all happened on. I'm taking it all in.\"\n\nDespite misgivings, I bought the shirt with the kneeling Rolfe. I was almost ready to leave when I realized in horror I had not gotten Pocahontas' perspective from Pocahontas.\n\nPhoto courtesy Chuck Durfor\n\nBuck Woodard agreed to introduce me to 25-year-old Wendy Taylor (Chief Brown's cousin), but only after she had had a decent break. As I waited in the tent, my eyes roved to John Rolfe (actor David Catanese) in his red suit and 17 th -century hat sneaking a Tastykake powdered sugar donut from the craft services table. I reached for my iPhone to document this, and he gave me a thumbs-up, then the bride was ready to say hello.\n\nWoodard stood nearby, perhaps to make sure I was asking respectful questions. \"I saw the movie Pocahontas I can't even count how many times. I was always pretending to be her. I love being her,\" said Taylor. Woodard looked like he was disappointed that Taylor's excitement in being cast stemmed from watching a vamped-up maiden in Disney cartoons. But then he put in, \"Now that she has a 4-year-old and a 9-month-old, she's watching it again.\"\n\nI was startled and excited to find out that the silver-haired man next to me listening to our conversation was the most famous man at the fort, the archeologist who insisted more than 20 years ago that the fort had not washed away, that its traces could still be found along the James River. Oh my! I had just read his book on the train. Could I interview him, too?\n\nWilliam Kelso happily started in with the story he has told countless times. \"I began by myself, 20 acres started by shovel, I then noticed a dark streak in the soil. Man, I was beside myself! Right away I found an object, and we have since found 1.7 million other objects.\" None of this would be happening if not for his vision-not the archaeological research, not the World of Pocahontas Unearthed exhibit that opened June 6 at the Jamestown site, not the wedding re-enactment.\n\nâIâll fall in my last hole here, probably.â\n\n\"It is something, isn't it, for it's on the genuine site? It's a lovely day, but meeting the Queen, that was my best moment,\" he said. In 2007, Kelso was made Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire.\n\n\"I was told the Queen wanted a reflective moment, so I racked my brains for something good to say to her. When I met her, I spent 20 minutes with her guiding her around in her blue coat and blue hat. There was a lot to catch up on since her 1957 visit to the fort. She loved all of it, and I whispered, 'Your majesty, this is where the British Empire began, this was not just the first American colony, this was the first colony in the British Empire.' \" He chortled. \"She loved that bit of information, she gave the best smile and incorporated that tidbit into her speech. Bush was there, too, you know, but making the Queen smile. That was wild .\"\n\nKelso pointed to where he lives year-round, a building on site, in a caretaker's house provided by Preservation Virginia. \"That's why I can be here so often. I'm waiting on what the future still holds. Hopefully my career highlight is still ahead. Did anyone tell you work started a few days ago on the western end of the island, 20 unexplored acres? It took us 20 years to dig one acre. So think about that, one acre, 95 percent of the site is uncovered. There is years of work ahead. I'll fall in my last hole here, probably. I'm too excited to stop.\"\n\nOn the Amtrak ride home, I worried that I would, like so many before me, convince myself that I deeply understood a complicated history after a glimpsing visit. My reported journey to Jamestown will be hopelessly outdated in 50 years, like all of the accounts I have read, starting with the ones by the settlers at Jamestown who had a late-medieval perspective and offered the world a Christians vs. savages account. Their \"good Indian woman who saved the life of a white man\" tale is spectacularly loved even today. In other accounts, Pocahontas has been portrayed as a brat at Jamestown; she has been called powerless, and even matter-of-factly a prick-tease. The divide in interpreting her story is not just between cultures; in academic circles, there are still factions with brittle pride warring over whether Pocahontas really saved John Smith from death, whether he made the story up, or whether the narrative was about a ritual drama John Smith simply didn't understand. Some experts argue about the appropriation of Pocahontas as an American Indian woman that the larger public has reduced to a \"Pocahottie\" Halloween outfit. None of these tropes is centered within a firm Algonquian indigenous worldview, perhaps an almost impossible task 400 years later. Divergent takes on historical events will not always be reconciled.\n\nBut even if I went to Jamestown and all my daughter got was a lousy T-shirt, I have gotten so much more out of the pilgrimage.\n\nTop Comment\n\nReally enjoyed this article, as an anthropologist who has done recent research on tourism and the depiction of an imaginary historical past.

      "text": "Native American histories show rebuilding is possible - and necessary - after catastrophe\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nWhat the Medicine Wheel, an indigenous American model of time, shows about apocalypse.\n\nby B.L. Blanchard\n\nPart of Against Doomerism from The Highlight , Vox's home for ambitious stories that explain our world.\n\nIn the dead of winter of late 2020 in the city of Shikaakwa, on the frozen shores of Ininwewi-gichigami, there is no pandemic. The high-rise buildings downtown are vertical forests, with balconies and rooftops designed as an outgrowth of nature. The Anishinaabe people bustle through a city of their own design. They watch the championship game of baagaadowewin in sports bars on high-definition flat-screens. They speak Anishinaabemowin into their smartphones on crowded public transportation, drink coffee, debate politics, argue with their families, and gather around communal fires in the middle of the downtown area.\n\nShikaakwa doesn't exist. I made it up. It's the setting of my first novel, The Peacekeeper , an alternate history in which the Americas were never colonized. Shikaakwa is in the place of the city now most often called Chicago. Ininwewi-gichigami now appears on maps as Lake Michigan. Anishinaabe is what my people, the Ojibwe/Chippewa, and my tribe, the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe of Chippewa Indians, call ourselves. The Anishinaabemowin language, also known as Ojibwe, was suppressed and, in many cases, illegal to speak until the 1970s. The sport of baagaadowewin was eventually appropriated into lacrosse.\n\nShikaakwa as I imagined it could never exist - I created it from my 21st-century perspective, which is inescapably shaped by the trajectory the world actually took. Native societies experienced centuries of forced removal and genocide, and much of what we once had is lost and can't be re-created.\n\nLately, the news has felt particularly doomy, dominated by fears of a looming apocalypse due to climate change or nuclear war or artificial intelligence . This is understandable - any of these existential threats could irrevocably change the world, and what would lie beyond is unknowable. Native people know a thing or two about that; the world as we knew it ended long ago, and it continued to end again and again and again. Yet we also know that there's a future even after the apocalypse has come and gone. Rather than conceptualizing time as a linear march toward calamity (or, for optimists, toward the dream of utopia), it can be viewed as a wheel that we cycle through repeatedly, from creation to destruction to recreation.\n\nThe Indigenous experience embodies this cycle, providing evidence of a future after disaster. We're still here, after all, even if the context we live in would be just as unimaginable to our pre-colonial ancestors as a city on the present-day Great Lakes truly untouched by colonial history is to me.\n\nThe world we know today will eventually be destroyed, too, whether by our changing climate or some other world-altering force we can't predict or imagine. But the problem with the doomerist streak that's taken hold of so much of our zeitgeist is that it just stops there, creating a moral hazard that lets us stop imagining the future. Something new will always be rebuilt on top of what's destroyed, and we can never abandon our obligation to keep creating it.\n\nThere's a stereotype that Native people are stoic and steeped in wisdom. I am no authority and certainly no expert, and I don't purport to have any wisdom to share. I'm an urban Anishinaabekwe from Michigan's Upper Peninsula who's lived most of her life in California. I cannot speak for every Anishinaabe person, let alone every Native person. Our experiences and perspectives are as varied as any other group of people.\n\nIn Anishinaabe tradition, as well as in many other Native cultures, the medicine wheel represents the ever-churning cycle of life. Broken into four equal segments of yellow, black, red, and white, it starts on the right-hand side, reflecting the east as the source of the rising sun and beginning of all things. The four segments represent, among other things, the four directions, the four seasons, the four sacred medicines (tobacco, cedar, sage, and sweetgrass), and the four stages of life (birth, youth, adulthood, and elder).\n\nThe medicine wheel can also represent the repeating cycle of creation, destruction, and re-creation that has defined all of human history but has particular resonance for Indigenous communities. This cycle is reflected in the Anishinaabe creation story : The world was created by Kiche Manitou (the Great Spirit), then destroyed in a great flood, and then re-created by the Sky Woman, who fell from the sky while pregnant, clutching a handful of seeds. Seeking refuge on the back of a turtle, she created Turtle Island, the Earth anew.\n\nOur histories have been one never-ending turn of this wheel: We create, they destroy, and we create something new out of the ashes of what was left behind, saving what we can, and creating new things from the memories of the old. What's re-created isn't necessarily superior or inferior to what was destroyed. It is simply different.\n\nIn hindsight, the Americas' pre-colonial past can be imagined as a generative period of creation. For centuries, we were a continent of self-governing tribes that responsibly managed and lived in concert with the land. We built cities, trade networks that stretched from the Arctic to the Andes, and a system of governance so sophisticated that it eventually influenced American democracy. There was no reason to believe we wouldn't live this way forever.\n\nAnishinaabe tradition teaches that when you create something, you're not just creating for the moment - you're creating for the future as well. We learn to make decisions from a seventh-generation perspective , which you may recognize as a green marketing slogan , but, like so many aspects of American culture, it was our idea first. It's taught a couple of ways: One is to consider how each decision you make will impact others and the Earth seven generations in the future. We're also taught to consider the impact of decisions in the context of the three generations that came before you, your own generation, and the three generations ahead of you: Will it honor your past and lay the foundation for a good future?\n\nIn either case, you are taught to look beyond the horizon of what you can see and consider the kind of world your decisions will create. But we also recognize that the present is like smoke: visible and real, but ephemeral and impossible to hold on to. What we create lingers until either something replaces it or it is destroyed.\n\nIt's easy to feel as though the world is in a unique period of destruction. Housing, health care, and education are increasingly unaffordable ; hard-won civil rights are being stripped away ; democracy is under threat each day by a major American political party ; climate change will have devastating global impacts , however much we do now to mitigate it.\n\nThese things aren't exactly comparable to Indigenous history, but they do share a feeling of senseless and irrecoverable loss. Over the centuries, my people have been the victims of a coordinated effort to destroy us culturally, ethnically, and biologically. The dispossession of Indigenous people did not end with the Battle of Wounded Knee in 1890, though that's usually when US schools stop teaching Native history because it is generally regarded as the end of the Native armed resistance against the American government. In the early 20th century, two of my great-grandmother's cousins were sent to an Indian boarding school , where they were forcibly sterilized. In 1953, less than a decade after my Anishinaabe grandfather and his brother fought in World War II, the US government began a formal program of tribal termination , with the goal of eliminating Native nations' independence and requiring Natives on reservations to move to urban areas and assimilate into American life and culture. This practice continued until well into the Vietnam War era and did not officially end until it was repealed by Congress in 1988.\n\nThe United States has tried to breed us out of existence through blood quantum laws, which classify people as Native only if a certain percentage of their ancestors were \"full-blood\" Native Americans, whatever that means. If you fell below the required threshold, you were no longer legally Native. After a few generations of intermarriage , that's pretty easy to do.\n\nThe blood quantum system still exists, both officially and informally. If you want to get a tuition waiver as a tribe member in Michigan, you must be at least one-quarter Native. I don't look the way most people expect an Anishinaabekwe to look; whatever you're picturing, I'm probably not it. When I share my affiliation and heritage, the first question I am often asked is what percentage I am. As the old saying goes , only dogs, horses, and Indians are classified this way.\n\nIndigenous sovereignty continues to be attacked and contested, like just last year, when the US Supreme Court partially walked back a ruling that held that most of Oklahoma was Indian land. It will be like this as long as our persistence as independent nations is seen as in conflict with the United States. Rates of violence against Indigenous women are appallingly high and under-covered compared to white victims. The name of the sports teams at my mother's high school in Marquette, Michigan, is still the Redmen , despite decades of debate and requests for change.\n\nYou could say, and many people do, that the past five centuries have constituted one long period of destruction. It absolutely has been. Entire nations, cultures, and languages have been lost, and so much has been lost even among those of us whose traditions and cultures survived. At the same time, you might also see it as part of a cycle of destruction and re-creation, of Native people re-creating and facing the destruction of what we'd rebuilt, only to rebuild it again and again and again. The US government did everything it could to destroy us, yet we are still here.\n\nMore than 100 years ago, pursuant to the Dawes Act , which converted the Native American system of communal land ownership into a private property system, the US government came to the Anishinaabeg across Michigan, including to my family in the Upper Peninsula. They offered a deal: My family could stay on the land that had been theirs for at least the past 5,000 years, but they had to stop communal farming and parcel out the land in individual 160-acre allotments for each nuclear family. If they wanted to stay, they would have to forget who they were and start living like white people. After each family got their 160 acres, the remaining land was taken by the government and made available for purchase by white settlers. While it had been US policy since the time of George Washington to \"assimilate\" and \"civilize\" Native peoples by forcing them to give up collective life and farming, this attempted to enforce it once and for all.\n\nMy family took the deal. Because of that difficult choice, my great-great-grandparents, great-grandparents, grandparents, father, aunts, uncles, cousins, and their children lived on and continue to live on the land. Their allotments have been bought, sold, and traded over the last century, and our ideas of culture, identity, and self have been both destroyed and rebuilt over that same period. Yet we are still fishing the same lakes and streams, still hunting in the same woods, still sitting around fires telling stories long into the night. You can even hear Anishinaabemowin spoken, though it's often learned far later in life. My father didn't learn to speak it until he was in his 60s.\n\nWhite people bought the land that remained after it was parceled out, farmed it, paved over it, built landfills and factories and power plants, and hollowed out what was inside with pipelines and mines, belching smog and carbon and CFCs into the sky. The same thing was done to the Odawaa, the Haudenosaunee, the Neshnabé, the Hocągara, the Diné, the Myaamia, the Mamaceqtaw, the Maskoutench, the Meshkwahkihaki, the Othâkîwa, the Giiwigaabaw, the Shawanwaki, the Wyandot, the Lakota, and the more than 500 other nations living on land now under US jurisdiction.\n\nThis has happened on a wide scale - Native perseverance and reinvention alongside ongoing colonialism that threatens to swallow up what we have left. Native Americans have integrated into settler colonial society, too. We obtain college degrees, work in offices and hospitals and government and retail shops, fly in airplanes, drive cars, write novels, direct movies and television, talk on cellphones, paint portraits and landscapes, compete in the Olympics, and walk in space. I'm a lawyer and a published author, and I'm also Native. As a percentage of both professions, the share of Native Americans rounds to zero. This means that, statistically speaking, I don't exist, yet obviously I do.\n\nPerhaps it's colonial society's drive to destroy and replace that makes it inclined to see today's global challenges as apocalyptic. For us, though, extinction was never an option. Because Native people maintained and continue to fight for self-determination, we still have a future.\n\nI'm often asked how, in the world of The Peacekeeper , colonization was avoided; it's never directly addressed in the book. To my mind, so many things had to go wrong for it to happen that any number of small differences in the course of history could have led to vastly different outcomes, and therefore any and all theories can be true. Thinking through these contingencies is important, but I find it more valuable to see the alternatives that could've existed. Colonialism wasn't inevitable. The horrors of the past 500 years did not have to happen. The potential calamities of the next 500 years can likewise be avoided.\n\nIndigenous futurism is a movement in art and literature, particularly through speculative and science fiction, that explores the present and future through an Indigenous-centered lens. This is what I aimed to do in creating Shikaakwa, considering what Indigenous communities might look like today if the historical fact of colonialism had gone differently, the benefits and limits of a Native restorative justice system, and how our relationship to the earth would drive urban development.\n\nSome Indigenous futurist literature explicitly responds to the idea of apocalypse, and of Indigenous people having lived through one. I wanted to write a story in which the apocalypse was more or less inconceivable, where Indigenous people engage with one another and with their own value systems rather than with colonial invaders. Creating the world in The Peacekeeper was an act of re-creation like in the medicine wheel; it imagines a world radically unlike our own; at the same time, it's a re-creation of what still might be.\n\nEarth is a resilient planet that knows how to re-create out of destruction. Over 4 billion years ago, it collided with the planet Theia and created the moon. Volcanic eruptions eventually yield flower-covered meadows. We humans are a clever species; we eventually walked on that same moon born of destruction. One day we, with all of our conflicts here on earth, will be gone, too.\n\nViewing the universe through cycles of creation, destruction, and re-creation gives a wider, more expansive sense of time in which an individual life is a tiny part of a greater whole. Even human existence is just one blip in this greater scheme.

Famous landmarks like Antelope Canyon and Monument Valley are empty. Flea markets that are normally bustling hubs of commerce in this remote area are now closed. But for those living in and around Kayenta, there is still water to haul, wood to chop, and sheep to herd at home.\n\nThe town of 5,189 is taking stricter measures for social distancing since 18 cases of Covid-19 , the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, were confirmed over the past two weeks. On Saturday, Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez issued a stay-at-home order, prohibiting residents of the country's largest Indian reservation - spanning 27,413 square miles from Arizona to Utah to New Mexico - from leaving their homes unless it is for food or medicine. Tribal police are already patrolling grocery store parking lots, enforcing social distancing and purchasing limits while children shop for their elders who wait in the car.\n\nThe Navajo Nation isn't the only Indian community to feel the impact of the coronavirus. The first person in Oklahoma to die from Covid-19 complications was a 55-year-old citizen of the Cherokee Nation . A Northern Arapaho tribal member on the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming tested positive on Saturday and the tribe has declared a state of emergency for the reservation that spans over 2.2 million acres. Last weekend, Minnesota Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan, of the White Earth Band of Ojibwe, lost her brother to Covid-19 after he was already battling a cancer diagnosis.\n\nNatives living in urban areas like Salt Lake City, Seattle, and San Jose are contracting the virus in high numbers as well. According to the National Council on Urban Indian Health, \"The Urban Indian Organizations located in Seattle, Washington, is projecting a monthly loss of $734,922 during this pandemic,\" meaning the urban health clinics are dipping into their limited noncoronavirus-related funding to cope with the pandemic.\n\nAs of March 23, there are 35 confirmed cases in the Indian Health System, the federal government's agency that provides medical services to Native people, including two deaths, according to Indian Country Today . This number likely does not include individuals who went immediately to a non-Native hospital or ICU because their symptoms were serious. In addition, testing is not accessible in most Native communities, leaving many cases to go unreported or experience extensive delays.\n\nWhile nearly no one in the country is safe from the coronavirus outbreak, its impact on Indian Country looks different from the rest of the US. Tribal elders are more at risk of Covid-19 because of high rates of diabetes and heart disease. Clean water for proper hand-washing is not accessible in all tribal communities, and overcrowding in Native homes is also common as many are multi-generational, creating social distancing challenges. Meanwhile, emergency federal funding for tribal health organizations has been delayed within the bureaucracy at US Health and Human Services. Then there are the negative economic effects, with hospitality businesses like casinos - often tribes' greatest source of income - closing. Indian Country's resources were stretched thin to begin with, and the coronavirus pandemic is exacerbating the disparities.\n\n\"Covid-19 could be a perfect storm for Indian Country,\" Dante Desiderio, executive director for the Native American Financial Officers Association (NAFOA), told Vox. Not only could the virus cause a drastic death toll - especially among at-risk elders who serve as community knowledge keepers - it could also wreak havoc on tribal economies that have barely recovered from the economic crash of 2008. If the government doesn't act fast, tribal populations, prosperity, and ways of life could be set back for a generation .\n\nThe federal government is obligated by hundreds of treaties with various tribes to provide health care to Native people. To execute this treaty obligation, Congress set up the Indian Health Service (IHS) in 1955 to provide direct medical care to Native people through local clinics and hospitals. Tribal leaders call this a \"prepaid health care system,\" where land cessions over the past few centuries have paid for the medical care administered today.\n\nEarlier this month, the National Indian Health Board - which represents tribal governments, including those receiving health care directly from the IHS - conducted a rapid survey to assess the needs of tribes earlier this month during the US's coronavirus outbreak. Only half of the respondents said they had received information from state or federal governments. Less than a fifth reported receiving resources (money, technical assistance, or supplies) from the state or federal governments, and only 3 percent reported having diagnostic test kits.\n\n\"The federal government keeps putting tribes in touch with their state and local health authorities, but in some places, they simply are not serving the tribes,\" Stacy Bohlen, CEO of the National Indian Health Board, told Vox. \"It's a mixed result across Indian Country.\" When asked if Indian Country is prepared to fight the pandemic, Bohlen said, \"I believe we are not prepared, our country as a whole is not prepared.\"\n\nOn March 6, Congress allocated $40 million in coronavirus aid to Indian Country through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which was supposed to pay for surveillance of the virus, laboratory capacity, infection control, and other initial preparedness and response activities. Congress also allocated another $64 million in aid directly to the Indian Health Service last week. On March 20, the US Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees both the CDC and the IHS, announced it was ready to disperse $80 million in funding from the first two relief packages to tribes, tribal organizations, and Urban Indian Organizations. However, sources familiar with the IHS said as of March 21, 98 percent of tribal clinics have not yet received funds from the initial allocation because of the lack of bureaucratic mechanisms to distribute funds from the CDC.\n\n\"History won't be kind if the federal government forgets about Indian Country during this crisis\"\n\nStill, tribal health advocates continue to look ahead. For the next round of coronavirus aid, they're asking for $1.2 billion for health-related spending in Indian Country . This would include funding to recruit doctors and nurses, secure medical supplies and protective gear, as well as increase testing capacity at tribal clinics. Currently, there are no IHS clinics that can run Covid-19 lab tests in-house.\n\nSince the health impacts of the virus are exacerbated by a slow federal response, tribal advocates are asking for funding that allows tribal governments to have the most flexibility to address the outbreak in their local communities. They also ask that Congress include tribal governments every time state and local governments are listed in legislation. This often-unintended exclusion creates massive policy hurdles down the line that could mean life-or-death decisions in Indian Country when tribes do not have explicit authorization from Congress to take action to protect their communities.\n\n\"History won't be kind if the federal government forgets about Indian Country during this crisis,\" VaRene Martin, first vice president of NAFOA and citizen of Thlopthlocco Tribal Town, Muscogee (Creek) Nation, told Vox.\n\nMuch as blue-state governors have acted more swiftly and effectively in recent weeks than the federal government has when it comes to their communities' public health, the same could be said for tribal leaders who are taking every step possible to stop the spread of the virus. Of the 574 federally recognized tribes, 53 have declared public health emergencies, 41 have imposed travel restrictions, and 39 have closed their reservations or issued a stay-at-home notice, according to the Department of the Interior.\n\n\"We took swift action [to declare a state of emergency] as we saw the numbers of confirmed cases in the state escalate from 5 to 14 to 21,\" Melanie Benjamin, chief executive of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe in Minnesota, told Vox. Tribal governments, just like state and local governments, become eligible for a large number of federal funds after they officially declare a state of emergency. \"We shut down schools and sent all nonessential employees home. We took every precaution we could up front,\" she said. \"My biggest concern is if that virus shows up here.\"\n\nTo prevent the spread of Covid-19, CDC guidelines ask individuals to wash their hands and sanitize all surfaces - both of which require access to clean water. However, according to the National Institutes of Health , 13 percent of Native American homes lack safe water or adequate wastewater disposal facilities, compared to the national average of less than 1 percent. Advocates are asking for $1 billion in assistance for safe water and sanitation systems in Indian Country, short of the $5 billion the Government Accountability Office says is needed to cover all tribal areas.\n\nAnother factor that makes Native communities vulnerable to the coronavirus is the overcrowding in tribal housing. Sixteen percent of American Indian and Alaska Native households in tribal areas are overcrowded, eight times the national average. Many tribal homes are intergenerational, where grandparents are active in their grandchildrens' lives, making transmission to elderly and at-risk individuals very easy and social distancing more difficult. \"Social distancing is not a cultural value of Native people, but it's a safety measure that we need to adopt,\" Bohlen of the National Indian Health Board told Vox.\n\nA third factor is health: Those with pre-existing conditions like diabetes and hypertension have higher death rates from Covid-19 than those without. And American Indians and Alaska Natives have higher rates of diabetes than any other racial group in America at 16 percent, double the rate of white Americans at 8 percent. When it comes to high blood pressure, Native people have 3 percent higher rates compared to non-Hispanic whites. Both of these factors make the Native American population more at risk for the severe impacts of the coronavirus.\n\nMuch like national and global economies, tribal economies have also taken a hit during the pandemic. The hospitality industry - resorts, golf courses, casinos, and restaurants - is the largest source of income for tribes and their surrounding rural communities. Native American food and retail businesses, as well as casinos that normally operate 24 hours a day, have all closed their doors.\n\n\"The hardest decision so far was deciding when to shut down our two casinos,\" Benjamin told Vox. For the Mille Lacs Band and many other tribes, these casinos serve as the economic engine for the community. The $32.8 billion tribal casino industry provides critical funds for elder, youth, and health programs, as well as jobs for tribal members. Benjamin worries that \"for some tribes farther North where the population is smaller, this is going to be devastating. Smaller tribes in more rural regions will be hit first and be hit the hardest economically.\"\n\nFor many Native people, the coronavirus outbreak is reminiscent of the diseases that swept across Indian Country in the 1800s and 1900s that killed a majority of their ancestors. An estimated 90 percent of Native Americans died from disease and warfare when white colonizers spread across the continent.\n\nEven in times of crisis and uncertainty, though, Native people continue to find strength and resilience in their culture. To heal a young girl who was close to death during the outbreak of influenza in 1918, the Anishnaabe created the jingle dress dance . According to the Anishinaabe story, the young girl's grandfather, a medicine man, dreamed of a dress made out of jingles that would create a healing sound when she danced in it. When the girl first put on the dress her grandfather made, she was too weak to dance. But with her relatives holding her up, she started to dance on her own, making a rain-like sound, and she eventually recovered from her illness. Since then, the jingle dress dance has become a popular women's powwow dance, as well as a traditional healing and prayer dance. The wooshing sound of the jingles can be heard at gatherings across the country every summer.\n\nSince the outbreak of Covid-19, hundreds of videos have been shared across social media of women partaking in the traditional Anishnaabe healing dance and praying for those who are ill. When asked about the popularity of the videos, Benjamin, whose tribe is of the Anishnaabe culture, said: \"Our resilience is what is going to get us through this.\"\n\nMaria Givens is an enrolled member of the Coeur d'Alene Tribe (Schitsu'umsh) in northern Idaho and resides on Cheyenne, Arapaho, and Ute homelands in Boulder, Colorado. She has a master's degree in environmental issues from the University of Colorado and has worked for the National Congress of American Indians and in the US Senate.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nby Max Fisher\n\nThe United States has a lot to be proud of : it is the most powerful country on Earth and a global leader in culture and innovation as well as international affairs, and has a well-earned reputation for freedom and democracy. But, like any country, it has its flaws, as well. And those flaws are important to remember and examine - even if many Americans would probably rather not think about them.\n\nThis map begins by showing Native Americans' land in 1794, demarcated by tribe and marked in green. In 1795, the US and Spain signed the Treaty of San Lorenzo, carving up much of the continent between them. What followed was a century of catastrophes for Native Americans as their land was taken piece by piece. By the time the US passed the Dawes Act in 1887, effectively abolishing tribal self-governance and forcing assimilation, there was very little left.\n\nEuropean settlers who arrived in North America found it filled with diverse, long-established societies. They may well have become sovereign nation-states had the settlers, and later the United States, not sought to purge them from their lands, deny them self-rule, and, once they had been reduced to a tiny minority, forcibly assimilate them and their land. These acts are the foundation upon which the United States as we know it today was built.\n\nImage credit: Sam B. Hillard/Sunisup\n\nThe largest act of ethnic cleansing perpetrated by the United States government began in 1830, when Andrew Jackson signed the Indian Removal Act into law, which gave him the power to negotiate the removal of Native American tribes in the South to land west of the Mississippi. Of course, those negotiations were corrupt and rife with coercion. Take, for example, the removal of the Cherokee, which was conducted via a treaty never approved by leaders of the Cherokee nation and resulted in, according to a missionary doctor who accompanied the Cherokee during removal, about 4,000 deaths, or one-fifth of the Cherokee population. Later scholarship suggested the numbers could be even higher than that .\n\n-Dylan Matthews\n\nImage credit: Nikater\n\nThis map of indigenous population density today shows the effects of not just the initial disease-driven depopulation of North America in the wake of European settlement in the 15th to 18th centuries, but also the long effort of the US government in the 19th century to remove Native Americans from their homes and place them in reservations of its choosing. The Cherokees of Georgia are gone, having been forced to relocate to eastern Oklahoma. A handful of counties in the upper Plains states, Arizona, and New Mexico have large or majority native populations. Alaska natives are still a majority in a number of counties. But in most of the country - especially in the South, Midwest, and Northeast - Native Americans make up a vanishingly small percentage of the population.\n\n-Dylan Matthews\n\nImage credit: Rural Assistance Center\n\nThe fight over slavery in the United States began even before independence, as constitutional framers clashed over whether or how to reconcile the world's most barbaric practice with the idealistic new nation. The abolitionists lost, and while states such as Pennsylvania and New Hampshire ended slavery almost immediately after independence, slaveholders continued expanding the institution of slavery for decades. Slavery developed into a sort of cultural institution upon which Southern whites depended for their economic livelihood and their identity; they fought bitterly to press slavery onto news states. As America expanded westward, both pro- and anti-slavery factions tried to claim the territories as their own. The cultural and political divide deeply polarized the nation, leading inexorably to war.\n\nImage credit: Golbez\n\nThe New Deal brought with it a number of government institutions meant to expand access to housing, including the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and Home Owners' Loan Corporation (HOLC). This is an HOLC map of Chicago from 1939, with neighborhoods color-coded by stability, as judged by the government.\n\n\"On the maps, green areas, rated 'A,' indicated 'in demand' neighborhoods that, as one appraiser put it, lacked 'a single foreigner or Negro,'\" Ta-Nehisi Coates explains in the Atlantic . \"These neighborhoods were considered excellent prospects for insurance. Neighborhoods where black people lived were rated 'D' and were usually considered ineligible for FHA backing. They were colored in red.\"\n\nThis practice became known as \"redlining,\" and would be the norm in the housing sector as a whole for decades to come, effectively denying black people the ability to own homes.\n\n-Dylan Matthews\n\nImage credit: The Atlantic/Frankie Dintino\n\nThe demographics of America's public schools are changing. This year, for the first time in American history, nonwhite students outnumber white ones . But racial segregation in schooling - driven in large part by segregation in housing, and thus in school district placement - persists. The vast majority of white students attend majority-white schools. Black and Latino students are also likely to be in schools that are majority nonwhite, except in heavily white rural areas.\n\n-Dylan Matthews\n\nImage credit: Urban Institute\n\nFor some people, the American dream - the promise that working hard will earn you a better life - is alive and well; immigrants to the US often find their incomes multiplied many times over upon arrival. But for people born in the US, prospects are more dire. This map shows estimates from the Harvard Equality of Opportunity Project, spearheaded by economist Raj Chetty, which sought to estimate economic mobility at the county level. It found that in only a smattering of counties, mostly in the Plains, did children born into the bottom 20 percent of the income distribution have a decent shot of making it into the top 20 percent. In the South and Midwest, the odds are perilously close to zero.\n\n-Dylan Matthews\n\nImage credit: Harvard Equality of Opportunity Project\n\nIn a 2013 UNICEF study, the United States ranked 34th out of the developed world's 35 countries by child poverty rates, above only Romania. The poor US showing in this data may reflect growing income inequality. According to one metric of inequality , the US economy is one of the most unequal in the developed world. This would explain why the United States, on child poverty, is ranked between Bulgaria and Romania, though Americans are on average six times richer than Bulgarians and Romanians.\n\nImage credit: Max Fisher\n\nAccording to a metric called the Palma Ratio , which measures economic inequality, the US ranks 44th out of 86 countries, below virtually the entire developed world and one spot below Nigeria.\n\nImage credit: Max Fisher\n\nIf there was a single moment when the US became a global power, it was the war with Spain. The Spanish Empire had been crumbling for a century, and there was a ferocious debate within the US over whether America should replace it as a European-style imperial power, or if as a democracy the US should instead liberate peoples from imperialism. The debate centered on Cuba: pro-imperialists wanted to purchase or annex it from Spain (pre-1861, the plan was to turn it into a new slave state); anti-imperialists wanted to support Cuban independence.\n\nIn 1898, Cuban activists launched a war of independence from Spain, and the US intervened on their side. When the war ended in Spanish defeat, US anti-imperialists blocked the US from annexing Cuba, but pro-imperialists succeeded in passing the notorious Platt Amendment, which placed Cuba under a quasi-imperialist form of indirect control; the US base at Guantanamo Bay is a relic of this arrangement. The war also ended with the US taking control of three other Spanish possessions: Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines, a massive and populous island nation in the Pacific where the US fought a war against independence activists. The US had become a European-style imperial power. While this experiment in colonialism was short-lived and controversial at home, it began America's role as a major global power.\n\nImage credit: Anand Katakam\n\nMost Americans assume that Hawaii became a state democratically, like the rest of the US. They are wrong; it was absorbed in an act of overt imperialism and against the will of its native population. In 1893, when Hawaii was a sovereign nation, American businessmen seized power in a coup and asked the US to annex it. President Cleveland refused to conquer another nation, but when William McKinley took office he agreed, absorbing Hawaii. This was the first of several imperial acquisitions the US made in the Pacific. Japan soon entered the race for the Pacific as well, and seized many European-held islands, culminating in this 1939 map, two years before the US joined World War II.\n\nImage credit: Emok\n\nThis map, from a 1945 report by US Air Force General Henry H. Arnold, put the American firebombing campaign against Japan into chilling terms. Next to each city is the percentage of the city's buildings that were burned down, as well as the name of a US city of equivalent size. Here are a few examples:\n\n• Tokyo 39.9% (New York) • Nagoya 40% (Los Angeles) • Kobe 55.7% (Baltimore) • Yokohama 57.6% (Cleveland)\n\nAll Americans learn about the two atomic bombs the US dropped on Japan at the end of the war, and we're starting to become more aware of the firebombing campaigns that wiped out much of Germany, including civilians. But we are nowhere near confronting the US firebombing of Japan, which killed several times as many people as the atomic bombs and physically devastated Japan for a generation. By the time the war ended, 30 percent of the residents of Japan's largest 60 cities were homeless.\n\nImage credit: General Henry H. Arnold\n\nDuring the Vietnam War, the US sprayed millions of gallons of defoliants and herbicides over South Vietnam in a misguided and horrifically callous effort to deny the enemy cover, shelter, and food. (The US also sprayed an unknown amount of these chemicals over Laos and Cambodia.) The most famous was Agent Orange.\n\nRather than assuring victory, these poisonous chemicals killed many thousands of Vietnamese civilians, spiked rates of cancer and other diseases, caused a generation of Vietnamese babies to be born with alarmingly high rates of birth defects, and devastated the environment and economy of the nation that the US was ostensibly trying to save. The Vietnamese Red Cross estimated in 2002 that up to 1 million civilians still suffer from health problems due to exposure. Many Americans still suffer as well, with thousands of veterans similarly affected by the chemicals.\n\nImage credit: Max Rust and Phil Geib/Chicago Tribune\n\nAmerican and Soviet fears of a global struggle became a self-fulfilling prophecy: both launched coups, supported rebellions, backed dictators, and participated in proxy wars in nearly every corner of the world. This map shows the world as it had been left utterly divided by the conflict, marking the allies and insurgencies back by the US and Soviet as of 1980.\n\nNot every ally was a puppet, of course - many were democracies, and others were dictatorships that had become that way independently of the Cold War or the United States. Still, the US backed or imposed a number of abusive regimes that could only be described as right-wing puppets - for example, Augusto Pinochet in Chile or Mohammad Reza Pahlavi in Iran. It also supported insurgencies in much of the \"Third World\" - meaning anything outside of the West or the Soviet sphere.\n\nImage credit: Minnesotan Confederacy\n\nNo one has suffered more from the Iraq War - which in some ways is still ongoing - than Iraqi civilians. The fluctuations in this chart show the first three distinct stages of the war. The first, from 2003 to 2005, was the war between the US-led invasion force and Iraqi forces, including government forces as well as Islamist and nationalist insurgents. Civilians in this period were bystanders. In early 2006, however, Iraq's conflict became what is often described as a civil war, fought among three factions: Sunni insurgents, including Islamist extremists and former Saddam loyalists; Shia militias, some of them rogue members of state security forces; and the US-led occupation force. In this period, which lasted two awful years, civilians were often the target of the violence, with bombings and death squads seeking to ethnically cleanse Baghdad in particular. While conditions improved significantly after 2008, not long after the US forces departed in 2011, the country collapsed again into violence.\n\nImage credit: Joel Wing\n\nIn much of 2012 and 2013, the United States had a difficult and painful internal debate - first among policymakers and then after Bashar al-Assad's August 2013 chemical weapons attack - over what to do about the war devastating Syria. Ultimately, the country decided that virtually any action would likely make things worse and bring unacceptable risk for the US.\n\nBut, reasoning that surely the world's richest and most powerful country could do something , the White House announced the US would take in some of the millions of refugees - it is the world's worst refugee crisis - who have been displaced by the war into neighboring countries, where they struggle to get by and risk exacerbating instability in those countries as well. But the US has not followed through, admitting only a few hundred refugees out of more than 3 million. Opposition from Republican lawmakers and conservative media, as well as simple bureaucratic disorganization, has slowed the program to a crawl. It is an unsurprising but sad demonstration of the fact that while America might be great at starting or sponsoring catastrophic wars, it is not always so committed when it comes to deploying that mighty wealth and power toward helping people in need.\n\nImage credit: UNHCR\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe two Republican justices appeared open to an attack on Obamacare, but ultimately seemed likely to reject it.\n\nThe Obamacare wars are back.\n\nUS health care is never going to be the same.\n\nThe case should have a clear outcome, but a Republican Court overcomplicates everything that involves abortion.\n\nKerr v.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe change, due to Covid-19, presents yet another hurdle for Native American voters in a hugely important election year.\n\nby Ella Nilsen\n\nPhotographs by Terri Long Fox for Vox\n\nWhen election season rolls around every two years, the approximately 2,400 eligible voters living in the Fort Belknap Indian Community in Montana's central plains start getting a lot of phone calls. Gerald \"Bear Shirt\" Stiffarm is often the voice on the other end of the line.\n\nFort Belknap sits on roughly 1,000 square miles ; its vast grasslands, where buffalo graze, and its dramatic mountain buttes make up about 25 percent of Blaine County. The main road is a two-lane highway that snakes through the rolling hills. Two Native American tribes, the Gros Ventre and the Assiniboine, call this land home.\n\nStiffarm, 71, occupies two roles on the reservation: He's the station manager at Native public broadcasting station KGVA in the small town of Harlem, and one of the founding members of the Snake Butte Voter Coalition, a nonpartisan group that has been mobilizing Native voters on the reservation to cast their ballots since the early 1990s.\n\nIt's a Herculean task. \"We call these people nonstop,\" Stiffarm said in a recent phone interview. \"We've heard every conceivable excuse there is for people not wanting to vote. They say, 'Nobody cares about me.' Well, we care about you.\"\n\nWhen Covid-19 hit, Montana gave its counties the option to switch to mail-in ballots for the June 2 primary - and all of them did . Instead of in-person voting on Election Day, voters could drop their ballot in the mail or vote early in person at each county's election office. But some satellite voting offices on Indian reservations like Fort Belknap also closed, leaving just one satellite office open in Blaine County for the primary, said county clerk and recorder Tammy Williams.\n\nThe satellite offices were the result of a 2012 lawsuit brought by three Native tribes to expand voting access on the reservations. In the last few election cycles, advocates say the offices helped increase Native American turnout across the state. During the 2018 midterm elections, Blaine County's voter turnout was 71 percent - on par with the county record of 72 percent in the 2016 presidential election, according to the local paper.\n\nThe Covid-related closures were a setback that required some Fort Belknap voters to travel nearly 80 miles into town to collect and drop off their ballots, then 80 miles back.\n\nWhile Montana as a state saw record primary turnout on June 2 - more than 389,000 ballots cast, compared with 293,000 in the 2016 primary, according to Montana Public Radio - the three counties with the lowest turnout were all home to Native American tribes including the Crow, Northern Cheyenne, Fort Peck, and Blackfeet. In Blaine County, primary turnout was just 46 percent, compared with 72 to 76 percent in some majority-white counties, according to the Montana Secretary of State's office . (Williams said she doesn't currently know whether one or both voting offices will reopen for the November general election, when turnout will surely be higher.)\n\nAs the novel coronavirus threatens the safety of in-person voting in 2020, voting by mail is on the rise . But this year's primary turnout in Blaine County illustrates how it poses a predicament for Native American voters across the US: A voting method that's supposed to be easier and more convenient adds yet another impediment to Native ballot access.\n\n\"You might as well say we are no longer citizens and can no longer vote,\" said OJ Semans, a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe in South Dakota and co-founder of the Native voting rights group Four Directions.\n\nThere are roughly 2.4 million eligible American Indian and Alaska Native voters living in the top 15 states with the highest populations of voting-age Natives, according to data from the National Congress of American Indians . Depending on how widespread and flexible mail-in voting is in the November presidential election, it has the potential to dampen turnout among those voters.\n\nThe problems related to mail-in voting are myriad for Native communities, advocates say. A lack of reliable mail access and a proliferation of nontraditional addresses on reservations, including those in North and South Dakota as well as the southwestern Navajo Nation , make home delivery impossible for many. For those with cars, simply visiting a post office to pick up and drop off a ballot can mean driving many miles on unpaved roads.\n\nMail-in ballots written in English are indecipherable to voters who don't speak it, including older Navajo speakers, or Yupik speakers in Alaska's Native villages who rely on translators at the polls. And if a voter is able to get a ballot and mail it in, there's still the chance that a local election official could toss it because of something like missing information or a signature that doesn't match the one on file. (Recent studies found that local election officials in Georgia and Florida were far more likely to reject ballots from minority and younger voters in the 2018 midterms.)\n\nAll of this, plus a long history of voter discrimination across the country, has contributed to Native American mistrust of voting by mail and a preference for casting in-person ballots, said Jean Schroedel, a political science professor at Claremont Graduate College and an expert on Native American voting rights .\n\nWhile the practice has expanded overall turnout in states such as Oregon and Washington, which have had universal vote-by-mail elections for years, it doesn't necessarily expand turnout among voters in minority groups such as African Americans and Native Americans, many of whom prefer in-person voting .\n\nAccess to voting was hard-won for Native communities, the result of years of lawsuits filed across the country. And vote-by-mail, activists and attorneys say, threatens to undo generations of work to increase voter participation on reservations.\n\n\"Vote-by-mail works really well for middle- and upper-class white folks,\" said Schroedel. \"It doesn't work for other populations, and it really, really does not work for Native people living on reservations.\"\n\nMore states - red and blue alike - are making the switch or expanding their vote-by-mail capacity due to the threat of Covid-19. And congressional Democrats want more funding to help states develop no-excuse absentee vote-by-mail systems, as well as expand early in-person voting at polling locations.\n\n\"Vote-by-mail is perfectly fine voter reform. It's great as part of a package of voter-friendly reforms to get more people access to the ballot,\" said Claremont Graduate College researcher Joe Dietrich, who works on Schroedel's team. \"The problem starts to arise when you make [it] the only option to get people the ballot.\"\n\nWhile Native American voting rights historically haven't gotten much national attention, Native voters make up an important bloc in states like Montana and Arizona - two states with key 2020 races that could help determine the balance of power in the US Senate. In the 2018 Montana Senate race, only about 18,000 votes separated Sen. Jon Tester (D) and his Republican challenger Matt Rosendale. But Native turnout soared by 19 points that year , helping Tester win reelection while other Democratic Senate candidates came up short in Trump-supporting states.\n\n\"Democrats are never going to win in Montana with more than [a 3- to 4-point] margin,\" a Democratic operative who was granted anonymity to speak freely told Vox. \"The difference when you have high turnout in the Native community and you convince them to vote for you - that's the difference between winning and losing.\"\n\nEven a few thousand votes make a difference. The sheer size of the Fort Belknap area means that shutting down satellite offices on the southern part of the reservation seriously disadvantages about 1,000 voters, Stiffarm estimated.\n\n\"We river rats on the north end, we get access to walk across the street and submit our ballot,\" Stiffarm said. \"The people on the south end, they're called brush cats. They live in the mountains; they're not as outgoing or gregarious as us.\"\n\nWilliam \"Snuffy\" Main, a Gros Ventre tribal member in Fort Belknap, was part of the effort to put satellite offices in Montana.\n\n\"I've seen a lot of instances in the past, with our tribal elections, people have said they mailed their ballots in but their name was not on the list as having voted,\" Main said.\n\nAs Stiffarm made his calls ahead of the June 2 primary, he discovered that voters who lived farther from town and had their satellite location shut down were less likely to want to vote.\n\n\"You have one voter going 78 miles one way. So guess what? They're not interested in it,\" he said.\n\nWith so much ground to cover in a rural area, Stiffarm and his volunteers typically rely on a sprawling family network in the tribes to get out the vote, starting with the grandparents on down to their children and their children's children.\n\n\"We contact strategic elders,\" Stiffarm said. \"They become like ambassadors for us. Each election, it means more to them to say, 'Yeah, those voter people called me, and yeah, I got all my kids to vote.'\"\n\nFamily connections and traditions are an integral part of voting in Fort Belknap. Because Native Americans fought so hard for their right to vote, the act of voting is cherished and celebrated in the community - a rite passed down from generation to generation. The importance of casting a ballot was instilled in Main early by his father, who worked as a miner in Butte, as well as his grandfather, a Gros Ventre tribal elder.\n\nWhen she was still alive, Main's mother voted in every election, even after her polling place was moved from 5 miles away to 18. Just a few weeks ago, Main took his son - the youngest of his seven children - down to the remaining satellite office in Harlem to register and vote in the state's primary. But Main has no desire to put his own ballot in the mail.\n\n\"A lot of Indians do not trust mail,\" he said. \"I don't know if it's something in my mind, I'd rather see my ballot dropped in the ballot box or run through the machine.\"\n\n\"I don't trust machines either,\" he added.\n\nVoting by mail doesn't necessarily solve a longstanding access barrier that one attorney referred to as \"the tyranny of distance.\"\n\nApproximately one-third of all Native Americans , or about 1.7 million out of 5.3 million people, live on what the Census designates as \"hard to count\" tracts of land. The Southwestern Navajo Nation, for instance, is 27,000 square miles spread out over Arizona, Utah, and New Mexico. In Alaska's remote Native villages, planes are the only mode of transportation to the outside world; that is, as long as the weather is good and the villages aren't socked in with fog.\n\n\"Indian country is rife with what are called nontraditional mailing addresses,\" said attorney Jim Tucker, who has represented Alaskan Native villages in lawsuits against the state. Traditional GPS doesn't work on many reservations; it takes detailed directions from someone who knows the area to get to a destination.\n\nDistance is one thing, but it's coupled with high rates of poverty on reservations. About 26 percent of American Indian and Alaska Native people were living in poverty in 2016, compared to 14 percent for the US as a whole, according to the US Census . For families living on tight budgets, voting can be an expensive proposition.\n\n\"We'd call them up and say, 'We want you to go vote.' And we know in that home they may have to decide if they're going to use their gas to get groceries or they're going to go vote,\" said Blaine County Commission Chair Dolores Plumage, the first Native American and the first woman elected to the county commission .\n\nFor Native communities across the country, the issues are similar. If a PO box is located 50 miles away, and a voter doesn't have reliable access to a car or gas, they're certainly not going to check it every day. The vast majority of roads on the Navajo Nation are not paved; if there's a rainstorm and a road washes out, they're stuck. In Montana, winter snowstorms in November have blocked reservation roads and required snow plows to clear a path to the polls. Post office boxes on reservations aren't necessarily open five days a week, and many have limited hours. Many families share the office boxes.\n\n\"We often had a shared box,\" said Darrell Marks, a Navajo Nation member and local educator who grew up in Tonalea, Arizona. \"I have three older siblings, and when they were off in their own home, they would still have mail sent to my mother's mailbox.\"\n\nTonalea is tiny town of less than 600 people located east of the Grand Canyon's North Rim. It sits in a vast sandy and scrubby desert on the Navajo Nation; its most prominent landmarks are two massive sandstone pillars called Elephant's Feet .\n\nWhen Marks votes in Arizona's elections, it's as easy as walking to the mailbox in front of his Flagstaff house and dropping in his absentee ballot. But when it's his mother's turn, just getting her mail-in ballot requires a 200-mile roundtrip drive from her main residence in Flagstaff to the post office box she keeps in Tonalea, where she still maintains a part-time residence on her tribe's homeland.\n\n\"Voting is still something she is very much committed to,\" Marks said. But keeping one foot on the reservation, where fixed addresses aren't always a given, and mail delivery is spotty, bears incredible significance to her, too. \"There's something about maintaining consistency or having a permanent address that has a lot of value to my mother and her generation.\"\n\nIf it's tough for a person to even get their ballot through the mail, the travel time for that ballot is similarly long and complex. With limited capacity and an inability to date-stamp mail at some of the smaller post offices, a piece of mail often is routed through major cities such as Salt Lake City, Utah, or Phoenix, Arizona, before reaching its final destination.\n\n\"That's how the postal system works, and that's a challenge for citizens on the Navajo Nation,\" said Leonard Gorman, executive director of the Navajo Nation Human Rights Commission. \"This is not an issue about 'You're not smart enough.' This is a system that was instituted several decades ago that really hasn't changed as much as it should to accommodate, for example, voting activities.\"\n\nAnother massive barrier to voting by mail is language . For tribal elders on the Navajo Nation and in Alaskan Native villages who don't speak English, reading a ballot in English without translation services is impossible. The state's response was to blame the tribes for, as the state characterized it, not informing officials about the language-translation issues.\n\n\"It's like if I handed you a ballot in Russian and said, 'Vote on this.' You're not going to understand what you're doing,\" said Tucker. Polling places are legally required to provide translation services; getting the state of Alaska to comply with the necessary translation services spelled out in the Voting Rights Act has not been easy, however. It's involved multiple lawsuits .\n\nSome congressional Democrats who have been some of the loudest advocates for putting vote-by-mail in place in every state before the November election concede that it doesn't work for everyone. Many believe there should be a safe, early voting option at physical locations for those who prefer it, with adequate protective equipment for poll workers.\n\n\"I think the answer is, this is not simply a hard one-size-fits-all,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), an advocate for vote-by-mail, told Vox. \"It's a recognition that we start with the presumption that everyone is going to get a ballot by mail, and in circumstances where that's particularly challenging, like with people living on reservation land, that we adjust the rules so they will be able to get their ballots and return their ballots easily.\"\n\nAdvocates in Montana and Arizona say the solutions should include plenty of time for early, in-person voting on the reservations in addition to voting by mail. They say there should be outreach and voter education and postage provided, so no extra cost is imposed on voters. And in Montana, a judge recently sided with the ACLU and NARF in a lawsuit to allow local voting rights groups to pick up ballots of voters who live far away from post offices or polling locations.\n\n\"If we were able to collect ballots, those people who wanted to vote would not have obstacles to voting,\" said Marci McLean, executive director of Montana-based Native voting rights group Western Native Voice. \"I think we could drastically improve turnout in our communities.\"\n\nIn 1924, the US Congress passed the Indian Citizenship Act , granting citizenship for Native Americans. But the law left it up to the states to decide whether to grant Native Americans the right to vote, and it would take nearly four more decades for all states to do so; Utah was the last in 1962 . When Native Americans started voting and running for office, white election officials were not always friendly.\n\n\"Because we were not considered property owners, we should not have the right to vote,\" was the message telegraphed to Natives in Montana in the late 1970s, Plumage recalled. As recently as 2018, Native Americans testified at field hearings held by Tucker and Native American Rights Fund attorney Jacqueline De León that they experienced racism from local white election authorities who suggested that they shouldn't be able to run for office because they didn't pay taxes (tribes do, in fact, pay taxes to the federal government).\n\nVoting disenfranchisement for Native Americans has moved from the outright denial in the 1950s and 1960s, before the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act, to other, more subtle ways that voting access has been made difficult. Before Montana's satellite offices were set up, Fort Belknap tribal members said, they'd show up to their designated polling place to vote, only to find local election officials informing them they had to go elsewhere.\n\n\"The locations often were changed on us. At times, I had to go drive off the reservation to a location to go vote,\" Main said. \"A lot of people got annoyed and didn't vote.\"\n\nIn 2012, Montana Native American tribes sued then-Secretary of State Linda McCulloch, alleging that sites for in-person late registration and early voting in Blaine, Big Horn, and Rosebud counties discriminated against them because they were located in the county seat - often far away from the reservation. A brief filed by the US Department of Justice at the time cited research calculating the disparity in distance for whites and American Indians in each county. The disparity was greatest in Blaine County, where the mean distance to the county courthouse for voting-age residents was about 10 miles for white residents, compared with 31 miles for Natives.\n\nIn 2013, Shelby v. Holder gutted a key part of the Voting Rights Act by striking down a provision requiring jurisdictions to \"preclear\" any upcoming election rule changes with the federal government before putting them into place. Now, Native Americans often have just one remedy to expand their voting access: suing.\n\nWhen Alaskan Natives fought for the ability to have an early voting period in their villages, the state Department of Elections sent just 25 to 50 ballots to areas that had hundreds of voters and said that it was enough.\n\nProblems have persisted. Attorneys told Vox that as recently as 2016, one local election official in Alaska kept more than 100 Native voters from being registered, refusing to send more than 25 registration applications per village because, the official said, they didn't think the Native villagers would fill out the forms.\n\n\"When we called and asked about that, [the official] said [Native voters] really aren't interested in voting, and if we send 150 registrations, we're only going to get a handful of them back,\" said Natalie Landreth, an Alaska-based staff attorney at the Native American Rights Fund. \"We see that all over the place, these local, county-level decisions that will have huge impact on registrations, ballot access. A lot of those decisions aren't set in statute.\"\n\nNative tribes have had some success to get the same basic rights afforded to other Americans, but these suits can drag on for years and drain tribes of their financial resources. Whereas tribes have to foot their bills, state and local governments have more resources through municipal insurance and aren't on the hook for court fees.\n\nAnd it can often feel like re-litigating matters already written into law. \"We're letting the courts decide who has rights and who doesn't have rights,\" Dietrich said.\n\nUnsurprisingly, years of lawsuits also breed mistrust and animosity between tribes and predominantly white governments at every level - local, state, and federal.\n\n\"You're going to have significant trust issues, and why would someone vote in an election where they don't trust their vote is going to count?\" Dietrich added.\n\nIn Montana at least, Native Americans are making progress at the local and state level. The percentage of Native American legislators in the state legislature (7.3 percent) is slightly higher than the percentage of Native American in the state's population (6.7 percent). Despite the effect of vote-by-mail on turnout in counties with large Native populations in June, 15 Native candidates won their primaries and will compete in the general election, including in the state auditor's race.\n\nWhile there's still plenty of lingering mistrust of the federal government and the predominantly white officials who currently run it, advocates and local officials say the only way to increase that trust is to get Native American voters to elect more of their own to positions of power. To do it, access to ballots, polling places and translation services will be key.\n\n\"I think people are realizing if we're not engaged, our issues will go under addressed or un-addressed,\" McLean said. \"We need to make our own seat at the table, because they're not going to make it for us.\"\n\nElla Nilsen is a politics reporter at Vox who covers the 2020 elections and Congress.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nOnce again, Native Americans are left out of the election conversation.\n\nby Maria Givens\n\nThis Sunday, Democratic candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders will duke it out on the debate stage, likely over the differences in their health care plans, economic strategies, and the proper response to Covid-19 .\n\nBut there is one thing we won't hear about - the 5 million people whose ancestors called this land home before there was a president of the United States. We won't hear about the 574 federally recognized tribal nations and their citizens. Nor will we hear about the plague of missing and murdered indigenous women . When candidates list out other minorities, like Black or Latino voters, my people won't be mentioned.\n\nAs a Schitsu'umsh woman, I know why no one is talking about us. Most people think Native Americans only existed in the 1800s on the back of a horse trotting across the prairie. The image of Native people is frozen there forever. More than any other race, ethnicity, or nationality in America, we suffer from invisibility. No one knows we still exist.\n\nAnd yet in the heat of the 2020 race, the Native vote matters. With 5.1 million Native Americans in the US, Native people are a critical voting bloc in swing states, rural states, and pretty much any state west of the Mississippi - and they tend to lean Democrat. The Native American population, according to the 2010 census, totals more than Iowa (3.1 million) and New Hampshire (1.3 million) combined.\n\nNative Americans are often left out of the election conversation, though, because many of us are rural. Accessing tribal communities in the remote mesas of Arizona or hills of North Carolina is too far of a stretch for these campaigns. Rural tribal areas often lack internet access and paved roads.\n\nFor a campaign to reach these remote places, it would take a canvasser days to contact just a handful of prospective voters. It would resemble more of a backpacking trip through the Grand Canyon or the Smoky Mountains than the typical door-knocking event in the suburbs with coffee and doughnuts. Having worked as a field organizer on a congressional campaign before, I can hear the voice of the field director in my head: \"It's not worth the effort.\"\n\nBut campaigns don't reach out to urban Native voters, either. Sixty-seven percent of all Native Americans live in urban areas. The 1950s policy of relocation incentivized Native people living on reservations to move to places like Denver, Minneapolis, Seattle, or San Jose, like my mother's family did. Urban Natives, like me, have jobs, friends, and social lives in the city while maintaining connections to their tribal communities back home. And I have never once seen a political campaign directing outreach to urban Native voters.\n\nWithout outreach, it's hard for campaigns to understand not only the diverse needs of Native Americans, but also where they stand with voters. If the federal government isn't reporting data on tribal communities, a swanky Washington, DC, polling firm definitely is not. Polling in Indian country for the 2020 election simply is not happening. This means that campaigns don't see how they are trending with critical Native voters, reinforcing the perpetual cycle of ignoring the Native vote.\n\nUnderstanding the Native vote at this point in the 2020 race means looking at upcoming primary states with large Native constituencies. If candidates were serious about Native Americans, they would court voters in Arizona, Alaska, Hawaii, Wisconsin, and New York as the race continues this spring. Alaska Natives account for 15 percent of the population in the state and have supported both Democrats and Republicans in the past, swinging statewide elections. Just ask Lisa Murkowski, the moderate Republican senator from Alaska, who owes her write-in electoral victory in 2010 in part to the state's Native population .\n\nMeanwhile, Donald Trump shocked everyone in 2016 by winning Wisconsin by 22,748 votes . What the pundits were not talking about is that the Native American population in Wisconsin totals more than 31,000 . If any Democrat aims to win Wisconsin in the general election, mobilizing the Native vote in this swing state is necessary.\n\nWhile Native American issues are complex and vary by region, tribe, community, and culture, there are key points many Native voters agree on - supporting tribal sovereignty and self-determination is the foundation of any tribal policy platform. Tribal nations are governments and want to operate as the sovereign nations they are and always have been. They want the federal government to hold up their end of the bargain on treaties, and that means paying for health care, education, and food. After all, tribal nations have kept up their end of the bargain and haven't taken back all the land in America.\n\nNative voters are also everyday Americans who have bills to pay and kids to feed. Our issues are rural issues, brown people issues, women's issues, and heritage issues. We care about rural economic development, agricultural tariffs, and keeping our brown boys out of prison. Native voters exercise their ancestral hunting rights and their Second Amendment rights to feed their families deer, elk, and moose. We practice our freedom of religion in places now called national parks or public lands. A Native American platform does not easily split down party lines and can vary drastically based on region and culture.\n\nThe only candidate to take on tribal policy in a serious way, other than Julián Castro , was Elizabeth Warren. Native people across the country had issues with Warren's DNA test and her claims of Cherokee ancestry when she was not recognized by the Cherokee Nation as a citizen. However, having worked in tribal policy in Washington for three years, in the Senate and for the National Congress of American Indians, I can confidently tell you that Warren's platform on tribal issues was the most comprehensive, pro-tribal sovereignty platform any candidate for president has ever produced. It was basically like candy for tribal policy nerds.\n\nBut now that she is out of the race, the remaining Democratic candidates stand about where you'd expect on the issues that matter to Native American voters. Both campaigns are rhetorically very supportive of tribal self-governance, self-determination, and upholding the nation-to-nation relationship between the federal government and tribal nations. This is expected for any Democrat in 2020.\n\nThe Biden campaign released a statement last week that expressed his intent to build on the tribal policy progress of the Obama administration. Jamal Brown, the national press secretary for the Biden campaign, told Vox the campaign has contacted Native voters at events and the candidate has recorded video messages for tribal events like the Four Directions Forum in Las Vegas prior to the Nevada caucuses. It remains to be seen if the former vice president's outreach strategy will ramp up as the campaign continues.\n\nThe Sanders campaign does not have a comprehensive written policy statement for tribal nations aside from a short page on his website , but Sanders has made in-person efforts to address Native communities. And it has worked - he won North Dakota, where tribal nations make up a large part of the state's Democratic Party. Similar to Biden, Sanders includes tribal nations in his major priorities like the Green New Deal. He has also supported the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act and a 10-20-30 funding allocation to aid low-income communities. However, Sanders's tribal policy is far from the revolution he promises in other arenas. (The Sanders campaign did not respond to Vox's request to explain its policies in time for publication.)\n\nOn Sunday, Biden and Sanders will stand on a less crowded debate stage in an attempt to reach voters who have not yet made up their minds. Will they speak to undecided Native American voters? Probably not.\n\nMaria Givens is an enrolled member of the Coeur d'Alene Tribe (Schitsu'umsh) in northern Idaho and resides on Cheyenne, Arapaho, and Ute homelands in Boulder, Colorado.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nDeb Haaland is investigating the history of hundreds of boarding schools that tried to \"Kill the Indian, save the man.\"\n\nby Fabiola Cineas\n\nLast month, Secretary of the Interior Deb Haaland announced that she will lead a national investigation into the more than 365 American Indian boarding schools that forced Native children to \"assimilate\" to American culture. Between 1869 and 1978, the federal government removed hundreds of thousands of Native children from their families and placed them in schools where they were stripped of their language, subjected to harsh punishments, and forced to adopt Christianity and its values.\n\nBy 1926, nearly 83 percent of Indian school-age children were attending boarding schools across the country.\n\nHaaland's investigation into the \"generational impact\" of these schools comes as children's remains were recently found at former boarding school sites in Canada - the Cowessess First Nation found 751 unmarked graves at the site of a former school in Saskatchewan; the Tk'emlúps te Secwépemc First Nation found the remains of more than 200 people , mostly children, at another school in British Columbia. In the US this month, the remains of nine children from the Carlisle Indian School, the notorious Pennsylvania boarding school that housed some 10,000 students, were finally returned to their South Dakota tribe.\n\nHaaland, whose grandparents were taken from their families as children and placed into these schools, sees the investigation as an opportunity to uncover history at a time when some in America want to reckon with the truth of our country's institutions and others want to obscure it. \"To address the intergenerational impact of Indian boarding schools and to promote spiritual and emotional healing in our communities, we must shed light on the unspoken traumas of the past no matter how hard it will be,\" Haaland said.\n\nWhether Haaland's investigation will be able to bring healing to Native American families that have suffered as a result of the US government's forced displacement is left to be seen. \"As a Native person who's grown up in the system, I don't know what the secretary of the interior can do to give me my life back,\" Jacki Thompson Rand, a professor of American Indian Studies at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, told Vox. \"But it's a start.\"\n\nThompson Rand talked to Vox about America's tragic boarding school history, its irreparable harm to Native families, and the promise she sees in Haaland's announcement. Our conversation has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nMany people are saying Haaland's investigation is a first step toward actually reckoning with a washed-over history in the US - how the federal government took Native American children away from their families and forced them into boarding schools. What's your reaction to that?\n\nWhat Haaland is doing right now is focusing on the tangible - can we find children's graves? And that's completely laudable. It's sort of an obvious first step, especially since the Indigenous communities in Canada have taken it upon themselves to find these graves. No one did it for them. They are doing it with their own equipment and labor, going around these old schools and using ground-penetrating radar and making these discoveries by themselves.\n\nIn the US, Haaland is going to scoop up all the federal records related to the boarding schools and start going through those, and they'll be very revealing. They will tell us a lot more than even someone like myself knows. But it will also show us a picture of US-Indian relations in the late 19th century at a particular time as United States-Indian policy enters the phase of assimilation.\n\nUS-Indian relations was first about removal, then it was about the Plains Wars in the 19th century [the series of conflicts between Native Americans and the US over control of land], then it was about creating reservations , which were horrible places. And then it was about starting the assimilation policy, a period which continued into the 20th century. \"Starving the Indian to save the man,\" as Richard Henry Pratt, who founded the Carlisle Indian School, said.\n\nAssimilation is sometimes used by non-Native people in a benign sense. But when you're talking about destroying people, identity, and cultural practices to somehow absorb them into white society, nothing seems benign about that.\n\nA key part of the country's assimilation policy for Native Americans was stealing kids and placing them in boarding schools. What kinds of conditions did the children face at these schools?\n\nI know from studying this and from my family's oral history that there were all kinds of violence taking place against these children. My mother and her siblings came from a family of Choctaw speakers. But in her generation, the language was lost because within the walls of the boarding school you were prevented from speaking your language. There's sexual abuse. Violence by children upon children was encouraged. I know specifically of an instance where a boy in one of the boys' schools was made to run a gauntlet composed of other boys. So you can just imagine what this did to their mental health - the punishment, the shaming - and if you were a child who had any spirit at all, they made it their business to take it right out of you.\n\nThe remains of thousands of children have been found at the sites where these schools existed. Most recently, remains have been found in Canada, but remains have been found at the sites of US schools as well . Why were children buried at the boarding schools to begin with?\n\nIllness was one thing. And I'm totally not on firm ground here, but I wouldn't be surprised if there were some suicides happening. The forms of punishment were so extreme that you can imagine children died as a result. For example, at Hampton Institute in Virginia, which was kind of the first Indian boarding school (though they don't call it this because it was established for free Black students), they used to punish children by putting them in the basement in isolation.\n\nI think the record would show that these schools weren't receiving sufficient resources for the children. I can imagine children going hungry, children not getting medical care, and children suffering really unspeakable consequences of sexual abuse. I can imagine children being killed.\n\nChildren weren't always on school grounds, either. They had something called a \"letting out.\" In the summertime, they would farm children out to white households and boys out to workplaces. They would be in the hands of other people without any kind of accountability as free labor. Girls would work in the house as servants and domestic help; boys would work in some kind of work environment like farming where they're not being protected in any way. They were exposed to lots of vulnerabilities. And remember, the whole time they really are being taught that being Native was a source of shame.\n\nCan you speak to how global this is?\n\nTo paint a global picture, this whole boarding school thing was repeated in Australia to the Aborigines, in Canada, and in New Zealand with the Māori. It's kind of like the colonialist playbook. But I think what I would say is that, as people have cited, the Native suicide rate is really high . It's astronomical across all the different populations.\n\nMental health issues are very big in our community. People like to talk about alcohol, but actually there's a really strong wave of sobriety in Native communities now. When I look at these suicide figures, though, I see historical continuity. I don't see it as a manifestation of something modern. I see it as something that's a manifestation of deep historical trauma.\n\nPeople need to make the connection. This isn't some kind of isolated history chapter - that it happened and now it's better. It's not better. We're all still paying for it. But you can see that the pattern over time is disappearing Native people; they're disappearing our nations. It's literally a physical intervention in our population to break us up and damage tribal nations.\n\nIs America ready to hear about what Haaland finds?\n\nWhat Haaland finds will be a history lesson for people who don't know it yet. This will be a history lesson about how the United States took Native people's land. How they destroyed or attempted to destroy their autonomy, including political autonomy, and made the effort to destroy their culture. What could be more basic than to take the children? What could be more harmful than taking the children?\n\nSometimes people will say to me, \"Oh, my god, I didn't know this happened in our country.\" Well, this is what colonialism is. This is what it takes to subdue a people. And this is what it takes to carry out ethnocide. This is what it takes to take hold of a territory.\n\nHaaland's plan is a starting point. But as a citizen of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma who has grown up in the system, I don't know what the secretary of the interior could do to give me my life back. My mother and her siblings are from Oklahoma and were all taken from their family and placed into the boarding school system starting in the late 1920s, and they remained there throughout their childhood.\n\nI don't know what anyone could do to have given my mother her life back. She died. In fact, all her siblings are dead now. When my cousins and I get together, we still have conversations about these three siblings and the really deep sadness that they all carried and how much we wanted things to be different for them. We tried to give our parents happiness and wellness. We all tried really hard to make them proud of us.\n\nThat hits really hard, this idea that the government that inflicted harm upon your community can't undo the terror they caused.\n\nYeah, and there's a deeply embedded resistance to this story or to having any kind of accountability for it. We have never received a full-on no-equivocation serious apology for all the destruction that came from establishing the United States. By the end of the 19th century, there were 250,000 Native people left in this country. If that isn't genocide, I don't know what is.\n\nWe have never even had a profoundly serious acknowledgment that the United States is built on stolen land and the free labor of Black people. This little capitalist miracle would not have taken off without free labor and free land.\n\nI was not really supposed to be here. But all along the way I've had access to resources - because by crazy circumstances I was able to go to college and then get a PhD. But many Native people don't have that. There's this idea that you \"stay stuck.\" You feel stuck and you try to figure out where you can get help. I can relate to that.\n\nYou told me about you, your mother, her siblings, your tribe. How does what they experienced impact you and your children? How does this trauma continue to show up?\n\nI was reading a news article about the graves found in Canada in which someone commented that \"everybody pays for this.\" And that's true because these children were institutionalized and they weren't shown how to have fully human relationships. They didn't have models for adulthood or for parenting. When they took children from a family, they frequently split them up between schools, as in the case of my mother and her siblings. The impact was really quite devastating.\n\nThe damage was profound, and it shows up in different ways. They get on with their lives - they have accomplishments and they get things done - but there's also fallout. In my mom's case, severe alcoholism and mental health issues. But then at the same time, my Uncle Tony became a Marine and he served in three wars. He was a highly respected person. And my Aunt Rosalie remained in Oklahoma and raised her family in severe poverty.\n\nThey all have different stories, but I think to answer that question of how do you come back - it's through the next generation. Their children experienced being reared by people who were not taught how to be parents, neither in the traditional way or in any kind of healthy way. That's why we talk about intergenerational trauma. We were raised by people who are fundamentally injured and carry that forward.\n\nWe, the children, come to the realization that we don't have to be ashamed to be American Indians. We know that there's something wrong. We learn our histories and see that what our family is going through is about something bigger. It is a part of history and a long emotional and psychological journey that we can see in retrospect. Ultimately, we come to understand the context in which our parents were injured and come to a place where it's more about forgiveness and compassion for our parents, each other, and ourselves.\n\nIs there anything bringing you hope right now and making you feel like we're moving in the right direction?\n\nOh, yeah. I look at Native people of a certain age now, and I can see how my experiences as a child are not the experiences that these young Native people have. The politics of the younger people sometimes don't entirely match up with my sensibilities - and that's not at all a criticism; there is so much political action among Indigenous students, Indigenous young people.\n\nMore and more of us are getting college degrees and going into various fields, and we carry our indigeneity into those fields. We're starting to have people in Congress and in state politics. Our tribes are just much more savvy than the tribes of even 50 years ago. They've learned a lot since the era of self-determination [the process in which Native people formed their own governments], which started in the late 1960s.\n\nAll of these things are very complicated because you're working with US institutions. It's hard to be very optimistic about anything that comes out of Washington right now because of the state of our politics. I hope the government will recognize the significance of these boarding schools in the history of American Indian communities, but also in the history of US-Indian affairs.\n\nWhat I'm really all about right now is changing the national narrative to one that helps us understand the United States in a fuller way. Let's move away from this valorous story of nation-building to one that takes in everything. Let's get rid of feel-good stories that gloss over all the pain, tragedy, exploitation, and destruction.

      "text": "The trauma of Thanksgiving for Native communities during a pandemic\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nNovelist Tommy Orange on whether racial justice protests and Covid-19 disparities bring a new perspective to the holiday.\n\nby Rachel Ramirez\n\nThe myth of Thanksgiving, a tale of a peacemaking repast between white colonizers and Native Americans, has long been debunked for its historical inaccuracies . But to reckon with the holiday is to understand how it helped set off a painful history of trauma - massacres, abuse, and negligence - that Native Americans still carry 400 years later.\n\nIn his 2018 novel There There , a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, Tommy Orange tells the story of the challenges Native Americans, especially those who live in cities, continue to face. He connects the characters' journeys of cultural and self-discovery through the lens of generational trauma; the book's prologue captures the gruesome history of Thanksgiving and Indigenous erasure, from the forced removal of Native American communities from their ancestral lands to current instances of cultural appropriation.\n\nToday, much of the truth of Native American history is still left out of the country's education system. Meanwhile, Indigenous affairs are minimally covered in the media. This is despite a year that has asked for reflection and action in terms of reexamining the country's racist past - protests for racial justice swept the country this summer, and the Covid-19 pandemic has disproportionately affected Indigenous communities and other communities of color. That many American families are still planning to gather this Thanksgiving, despite the risks to the most vulnerable in our communities, is a flashback for many to white settlers spreading deadly diseases that diminished Native populations.\n\n\"If Thanksgiving is a time of gratitude and a communal sense of being together, if we can think that way as a country, Covid-19 is one of the lessons where we can learn to think of other people and not ourselves first,\" Orange told Vox. \"That would be my biggest hope. But I don't know how much of that is happening.\"\n\nI talked to Orange about self-reflection during a time of racial reckoning, why Thanksgiving is still a widely celebrated holiday, and the upcoming sequel to his novel. Our interview has been edited and condensed.\n\nIn your book There There , the prologue speaks to the true history of Thanksgiving. How should that excerpt, plus the overall message of your book - the generational trauma Native Americans face in their daily lives - translate to people's understanding of Thanksgiving in relation to Native Americans today?\n\nMy son's 9, and we've seen him go through public school, and we could see the warning signs and the way they were going to teach Thanksgiving and what it means historically. It's indoctrination. Creepy is the way I feel about the way the lie is taught as if it's the truth. We're still so far from acknowledging something that seems basic to so many of us. So we just pulled him out of school the first year for the whole week, because we didn't want him to have to interface with that.\n\nFor my son, the next three years, we brought up a Native guy from Oakland who powwow dances, he sings and he drums, and his family dances. He had the kids ask questions about Native culture. He was able to, in a really compassionate way, address a lot of these misunderstandings and the way the general population thinks of Native people - a really monolithic version of what being native is.\n\nIn the book, I was just trying to bring something up that has to do with the way we look at history. Americans didn't care about Thanksgiving until Abraham Lincoln kind of breathed life back into it in order to mend the nation during the Civil War, to give us something to celebrate together. It could be a really cool opportunity for us to do the same thing now, around another civil discord, Civil War-feeling moment in the country with how divided we are - for us to leave Thanksgiving in the same spirits together and decide it's a stupid American holiday that is really hurtful to a lot of people and was never founded in anything patriotic or true.\n\nHow do you usually spend the holiday week?\n\nWell, I grew up celebrating it. My dad didn't have any problems with it. My dad wasn't an activist or overtly political in that way. He's thoroughly a Democrat and very distrustful of the government, but it's a really easy holiday to celebrate, because you get to eat great food and hang out with your family. Nobody likes to hate on Thanksgiving, because everyone kind of loves it for those good reasons.\n\nBut I stopped celebrating it in the past 10 years, and it's a struggle with in-laws who don't understand discontinuing wanting to celebrate it. So it's always kind of an awkward time, but I think it's really easy this year because of the pandemic. In the past, we've made a point to not do anything in particular, just enjoy the day off - including not supporting the Thanksgiving industry, which is buying all the Thanksgiving food, which is one of the many things that continues to support it as a holiday. We've gone to the movies different years. We've, like I said, just enjoyed the day together.\n\nWith the protests this summer, and the racial reckoning America is slowly having, how do you think the current climate will inform the holiday this year?\n\nRight now, the way it feels to me is it's fallen beyond surreal into absurd. People are holding on so tightly to their traditions under the guise of patriotism, even willing to die from it. I would hope that a lot is going to change because of what's come out in 2020. I would hope that ... [amid] the sort of economic collapse like the Great Depression, that social change will happen after these devastating historical moments. I'm still holding my breath about a lot, waiting to see what will happen. I'm pretty fatigued.\n\nI can't say that I'm hopeful that this will mean people will rethink Thanksgiving and Native history. I don't feel like I'm at a place where I'm allowing myself to hope like that. But I do feel like with all the awareness that's come up in 2020, for some people, it's an easy \"cancel Thanksgiving\" answer. Though I don't think there is enough progress to be noted, and I'm not trying to be completely cynical. It's just when we're divided as we are as a country, and when you still have the people in power that are sort of under the guise of this tradition and patriotism and noble country, it's hard to feel anything but cynicism.\n\nHow should people take this time to reflect and reexamine the brutal history surrounding Thanksgiving?\n\nI'm going to sound cynical again, but anybody who's taking the time to reflect probably already did enough of reflection this year - if not many, many years before - and is not actively celebrating it in a problematic way that you would need reflection to change. And anybody who does not get into their reflective state, because of what this all means, they don't give a shit. They're flying across the country during a pandemic to be patriotic. They're going to gorge themselves on turkey and gravy.\n\nThis is a side of the country I can't really understand. So I trust that people who are already reflective aren't doing it in a disrespectful or stupid way, and the people that do will just continue to do that. I don't see a lot of movement from the other side for this to be an opportunity for them to change their thinking. It feels really hard to reach across and make that kind of gesture during this time.\n\nLike you said, many American families will be gathering for the holiday, despite health officials' warnings not to . Meanwhile, Covid-19 is still a major issue disproportionately impacting Indian Country. Can you speak on how historical and current injustices have left Native communities vulnerable in the pandemic and how people can bring light to this?\n\nThe invisibility of Native issues seems to be a constant. The way that people are thinking about taking the risks - considering the numbers of who it's affecting more and considering overloading hospitals and affecting people who need medical care and older, vulnerable people - the opportunity to think about vulnerable people in a communal way, it's really anti-American because we're so individualistic. Me, me, me and now, now, now. I mean, if Thanksgiving is a time of gratitude and a communal sense of being together, if we can think that way as a country, Covid-19 is one of the lessons where we can learn to think of other people and not ourselves first. That would be my biggest hope. But I don't know how much of that is happening.\n\nIt would be great if this just didn't become a superspreader event. It's not just them that's going to be affected, it's overloaded hospitals, and it's going to affect other people.\n\nDespite the pandemic, Native people turned out this election and were key in swing states like Arizona . How do you see the tribal nations' relationship with the upcoming Biden administration?\n\nWell, it's good to hear during Joe Biden and Kamala Harris's speech even just the naming of Native Americans. Sometimes we get ignored, so it was good to hear us acknowledged. And I would hope that with Biden's language around making the Cabinet and the administration look the way the country does - we are a big part of the country's story, its narrative, its origins, and its present. We're a smaller number than a lot of other minorities, but we're an important part of the country. I would hope that moving forward, we could be included more than we had been.\n\nWhat are you working on right now? What's been keeping you busy?\n\nI'm working on a sequel to There There . It's supposed to come out in 2022, hopefully earlier in 2022 than later. So I've been deeply involved in getting that into as good shape as I can. The book goes into more history and also the aftermath of the powwow. It's called Wandering Stars .\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nApparently, we can't even trust these justices to follow their own very recent precedents.\n\nThe Court decided an identical case two years ago.

      "text": "Andrew Jackson was a slaver, ethnic cleanser, and tyrant. He deserves no place on our money.\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nby Dylan Matthews\n\nOn Wednesday, the Treasury Department announced that a portrait of Harriet Tubman will grace future $20 bills starting in 2030. It's a fitting, and long overdue tribute to a genuine hero of American history who helped end the gravest evil this nation ever perpetrated.\n\nBut the department also announced that the man currently on the bill - perhaps America's worst president and the only one guilty of perpetrating a mass act of ethnic cleansing - will still be on there: Andrew Jackson. This is unacceptable. Jackson was a disaster of a human being on every possible level, and should not be commemorated positively by any branch of American government. And as a slave owner, putting him on the other side of Tubman's bill is particularly disgraceful.\n\nAfter generations of pro-Jackson historians left out Jackson's role in American Indian removal - the forced, bloody transfer of tens of thousands of Native Americans from the South - a recent reevaluation has rightfully put that crime at the core of his legacy .\n\nBut Jackson is even worse than his horrifyingly brutal record with regard to Native Americans indicates. Indian removal was not just a crime against humanity, it was a crime against humanity intended to abet another crime against humanity: By clearing the Cherokee from the American South, Jackson hoped to open up more land for cultivation by slave plantations. He owned hundreds of slaves , and in 1835 worked with his postmaster general to censor anti-slavery mailings from northern abolitionists. The historian Daniel Walker Howe writes that Jackson, \"expressed his loathing for the abolitionists vehemently, both in public and in private.\"\n\nJackson's small-government fetishism and crank monetary policy views stunted the attempts of better leaders like John Quincy Adams to invest in American infrastructure, and led to the Panic of 1837, a financial crisis that touched off a recession lasting seven years. If that weren't enough, he was a war criminal who suspended habeas corpus and executed prisoners for minor infractions during his time as a general in the War of 1812.\n\nAndrew Jackson deserves a museum chronicling his crimes and dedicated to his victims, not commemoration on American currency.\n\nAny evaluation of Jackson must begin with American Indian removal, his policy of coercing Native American tribes into leaving their historical territory and embarking on dangerous and often deadly relocations.\n\nJackson's support for Native American removal began at least a decade before his presidency. From 1815 to 1820, he served as a federal treaty commissioner dealing with Southern Indians, and \"persuaded the tribes, by fair means or foul, to sell to the United States a major portion of their lands in the Southeast, including a fifth of Georgia, half of Mississippi, and most of the land area of Alabama,\" the anthropologist and historian Anthony Wallace writes in The Long, Bitter Trail: Andrew Jackson and the Indians . \"Andrew Jackson had a personal financial interest in some of the lands whose purchase he arranged.\"\n\nBut Jackson didn't only want removal for personal enrichment. He also wanted it as a way to further white supremacy and slavery, and to shore up his Southern support. \"The hunger for Indian land was most intense in the Southern slave-owning states, and Jackson as a politician generally reflected Southern economic interests,\" Wallace writes. \"Jacksonian Democracy ... was about the extension of white supremacy across the North American continent,\" Howe writes in What Hath God Wrought , his history of the 1815 to 1848 period. \"By his policy of Indian Removal, Jackson confirmed his support in the cotton states outside South Carolina and fixed the character of his political party.\"\n\nJackson wasn't alone; the entire Democratic party was in thrall to the slave power at this point, and receptive to policies like Native American removal that freed up land for slavery. \"The exaltation of the common man (meaning, on the frontier, the settler and speculator hungry for Indian land), the sense of America as the redeemer nation destined for continental expansion, the open acceptance of racism as a justification not only for the enslavement of blacks but also for the expulsion of Native Americans - these were popular, politically powerful themes that would have driven any Democratic President to press for a policy of Indian removal,\" Wallace writes.\n\nAccording to Howe, Indian removal was Jackson's top legislative priority upon taking office in 1829. He quotes Jackson's vice president and successor, Martin Van Buren, as declaring, \"There was no measure, in the whole course of [Jackson's] administration, of which he was more exclusively the author than this.\"\n\nWhile the law Jackson pushed through Congress in 1830, the Indian Removal Act, theoretically only authorized Jackson to negotiate removal with the tribes, Jackson had no interest in making deals. \"To him, the practice of dealing with Indian tribes through treaties was 'an absurdity,'\" Howe writes; instead he believed \"the government should simply impose its will on them.\"\n\nJackson's stance triggered huge opposition. Evangelical Christians opposed removal as a betrayal of Native Americans, and an impediment to missionary work. Congressional opponents like Sen. Theodore Frelinghuysen assailed it on moral grounds. The proposal only barely passed the House, 102 to 97, with Jackson supporters in the North defecting to the opposition. \"The vote had a pronounced sectional aspect,\" Howe writes. \"The slave states voted 61 to 15 for Removal; the free states opposed it, 41 to 82. Without the three-fifths clause jacking up the power of the slaveholding interest, Indian Removal would not have passed.\"\n\nJackson set about implementing the measure as soon as he was given the authority. \"In principle, emigration was to be voluntary,\" Wallace writes. \"But the actual policy of the administration was to encourage removal by all possible means, fair or foul.\"\n\nTo weaken tribal chiefs, Jackson's administration stopped paying them annuities to spend on behalf of their tribes. Some tribes were given tiny individual grants (each Cherokee got 45 cents a year, and then only once they got to the West), others nothing at all. Meanwhile, Southern state governments set about destroying tribal governments, banning tribal assemblies, making it illegal to pass tribal laws, denying Native Americans the right to vote or sue or testify in court or even dig gold on their own land (a provision passed only after gold was discovered).\n\nJackson's administration stood idly by and let it happen, knowing that the more Southerners harassed Native Americans, the easier it would be to coerce them into removal treaties. \"It is abundantly clear that Jackson and his administration were determined to permit the extension of state sovereignty because it would result in the harassment of Indians, powerless to resist, by speculators and intruders hungry for Indian land,\" Wallace concludes.\n\nThe first post-Act treaty, the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek on September 27, 1830, securing Choctaw removal, was achieved \"against the wishes of the majority of the tribe, by excluding the Indians' white counselors from the negotiations and then bribing selected tribal leaders,\" Howe writes.\n\nOnce Jackson's administration secured its fraudulent treaties, it set about the actual process of removal. From the very beginning, the process was deadly. About four thousand Choctaws died of cholera, and hundreds more died from hunger, exposure, and accidents, per Wallace. A steamboat carrying 611 Creeks up the Mississippi collided with another boat and was cut in two, killing 311 Indian passengers. Anywhere from 20 to 25 percent of Eastern Cherokees died either being rounded up or transported West.\n\nThe problem was not one of faulty implementation; Jackson's own actions made the process of removal bloodier and crueler. \"During the Removal process the president personally intervened frequently, always on behalf of haste, sometimes on behalf of the economy, but never on behalf of humanity, honesty, or careful planning,\" Howe writes. \"Army officers like General Wool and Colonel Zachary Taylor who attempted to carry out Removal as humanely as possible or to protect acknowledged Indian rights against white intruders learned to their cost that Jackson's administration would not back them up.\"\n\nThe actual death toll of removal is uncertain. The toll for Cherokees alone is typically given as 4,000 to 8,000, per Amy Sturgis's book, The Trail of Tears and Indian Removal . But thousands more Creek, Choctaw, Seminole, and other Indians died in the process as well, direct victims of the signature policy of the Jackson administration.\n\nIt's genuinely bizarre that some modern liberals, like Sean Wilentz and Arthur Schlesinger , have claimed Jackson for liberalism, ostensibly for his embrace of \"populism\" (read: rejection of northern anti-slavery white men in favor of Southern pro-slavery white men). In reality, Jackson's economic policy views were almost cartoonishly right wing.\n\nContext is important here. Jackson was succeeding John Quincy Adams, a truly great, scandalously underrated president who was an enthusiastic supporter of government intervention to build necessary infrastructure (\"internal improvements\") and fuel economic development. Adams believed that \"taxing and being taxed were essential to responsible self-government; the country required a modern, national, and regulated banking system ... and the federal government had an important role to play regarding the 'general welfare' in the creation of educational, scientific, and artistic institutions, such as the Smithsonian Museum, the national parks, the service academies, and land grant universities,\" according to recent biographer Fred Kaplan .\n\nJackson believed none of that. He believed government was a threat to be contained, that national banks like the one originated by Alexander Hamilton were abominations and threats to freedom, and that the federal government's role in building infrastructure should be limited. He vetoed a bill to run a road in Kentucky, arguing that federal funding of such infrastructure projects was unconstitutional.\n\n\"While he criticized the Maysville Road for being insufficiently national, Jackson did not wish to be misunderstood as favoring federal funding for a more truly national transportation system,\" Howe writes. \"Instead he warned that expenditures on internal improvements might jeopardize his goal of retiring the national debt - or, alternatively, require heavier taxes.\" The veto, Howe continues, ultimately led to \"the doom of any comprehensive national transportation program.\"\n\nJackson was a strict adherent to the gold standard, a position as silly in the 1830s as it remains today . This directly informed his war on the Second National Bank of the United States. \"That the modern twenty-dollar Federal Reserve Note should bear Andrew Jackson's portrait is richly ironic,\" Howe writes. \"Not only did the Old Hero disapprove of paper money, he deliberately destroyed the national banking system of his day.\"\n\nContrary to Jacksonian propaganda, the Second National Bank worked quite well. It produced reliable paper currency of consistent value across the country. But Jackson, as an avowed opponent of paper money and of national economic institutions like the Bank, vetoed the renewal of its charter in 1832. His rhetoric against the bank drew upon populist anti-bank sentiment, but its real crime in Jacksonian eyes was propping up a powerful government. \"The advocates of hard money did not condemn banks as agents of capitalism,\" Howe writes. \"They condemned them as recipients of government favor.\"\n\nJackson's war on the bank, combined with his intent on paying off the national debt, would lead to one of the worst depressions in American history. Once the government started running a surplus, Jackson had nowhere to put the money, without the bank around. So he divided it among the states. \"The state banks went a little crazy,\" Planet Money's Robert Smith explains. \"They were printing massive amounts of money. The land bubble was out of control.\" Before long you had the Panic of 1837, and years of recession.\n\nNot all economic historians accept this story of the Panic. Others think Jackson screwed up in other ways that caused it. Vanderbilt's Peter Rousseau , for instance, blames two actions Jackson took in 1836 - requiring public lands be purchased with coins rather than paper money, and \"supplemental\" transfers of money between banks by the Treasury that summer - for causing the crash. This interpretation, Rousseau writes, \"calls into question claims that the nation's seventh President was an innocent bystander and casts serious doubt on his financial wisdom.\"\n\nLeaving aside whether Jackson's acts of ethnic cleansing against Native Americans technically count as war crimes or just ordinary crimes against humanity, his career as a general included numerous actions which would absolutely warrant criminal action today.\n\nBefore and after Jackson's career-making victory in the Battle of New Orleans in 1815 - won after the war was technically over - he ruled the city as a tyrant, as Caleb Crain notes in the New Yorker:\n\nHe censored a newspaper, came close to executing two deserters, and jailed a state congressman, a judge, and a district attorney. He defied a writ of habeas corpus, the legal privilege recognized by the Constitution which allows someone being detained to insist that a judge look into his case. Jackson was fined for his actions, and, for the rest of his life, was shadowed by the charge that he had behaved tyrannically. In retirement, after two terms as President, he called on his reserves of political clout to get the fine refunded, and Congress ended up debating the legality of his actions in New Orleans for nearly two years.\n\nOn December 16, 1814, Jackson declared martial law, provoking an immediate backlash on civil liberties grounds. \"Despite the constitutional irregularity, Jackson imposed a nine o'clock curfew and required that everyone entering and exiting the city be vetted by the military,\" Crain explains. He arrested a state legislator who had resisted calls to suspend habeas corpus, and then ordered the man guarding the legislator to arrest anyone trying to serve a write of habeas to free him.\n\nJackson also had a penchant for executing people - soldiers, enemies, whatever - for little or no reason. In 1818, he famously ordered two British subjects, Robert Ambrister and Alexander George Arbuthnot, executed during the First Seminole War in Spanish Florida. He believed that both were helping the Seminoles wage war against the US. This was most likely not true.\n\n\"Arbuthnot ... claimed he had only sought the Natives' welfare and had actually tried to dissuade them from warmaking; this was probably the truth,\" Howe writes. \"Ambrister had indeed been helping the Seminoles prepare for war - but against the Spanish, whose rule in Florida he hoped to overthrow.\"\n\nArbuthnot was sentenced to death after a trial, and Ambrister to flogging and hard labor. Jackson increased Ambrister's sentence to death and carried both sentences out the next day \"so there would be no chance of an appeal,\" Howe recounts. \"A former justice of the Tennessee state supreme court, he must have known the convictions would not stand up to appellate scrutiny.\"\n\nHe also killed some of his own men for petty infractions. While in charge of New Orleans, \"six militiamen who had tried to leave before their term of service expired were executed in Mobile by his orders, a draconian action at a time when everybody but Jackson considered the war over.\"\n\nAndrew Jackson was an executioner, a slaver, an ethnic cleanser, and an economic illiterate.

Haaland attacks a 44-year-old law enacted to halt cultural genocide.\n\nby Ian Millhiser\n\nFor much of its history, the United States pursued a kind of cultural genocide against American Indians. American Indian children were often rounded up and sent to boarding schools, where Native children were forced to abandon their language and customs and to learn to behave like white Americans. Often, the architects of this policy were quite explicit about their goals - as the founder of one of these boarding schools said in 1892, \"all the Indian there is in the race should be dead. Kill the Indian in him, and save the man .\"\n\nSome of these boarding schools continued to operate well into the 20th century. There are people alive today who attended them .\n\nIn response to this history, and 20th-century policies by state governments that also separated American Indian children from their culture, Congress enacted the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA) in 1978. Among other things, this law provides that, if a state court determines that a child who is either \" a member of an Indian tribe \" or \"is eligible for membership in an Indian tribe and is the biological child of a member of an Indian tribe\" must be removed from their home, then the child should be placed with an American Indian family - and, if possible, a member of the child's extended family or, at least, their own tribe.\n\n(Federal law uses the term \"Indian\" to refer to Indigenous nations and their citizens, and this term has a distinct meaning that is different than the definition of the term \"Native American.\" This piece includes quotes and legal references that also use the former terminology.)\n\nNearly half a century after the ICWA became law, the Supreme Court is now hearing four cases, all consolidated under the name Haaland v. Brackeen , which claims that this anti-genocidal law is unconstitutional. The law is being challenged by non-Indian families who wish to adopt American Indian children , along with the state of Texas .\n\nThe plaintiffs' arguments are aggressive. They allege that the ICWA violates the Constitution in at least four different ways - and that somehow these violations went unnoticed for the law's first four decades of existence. Indeed, the Brackeen plaintiffs make one argument so aggressive that it could potentially invalidate much of the last century of federal law - including landmark statutes such as the Affordable Care Act, the ban on whites-only lunch counters, and the federal ban on child labor. And, while their other arguments do not go that far, most of these plaintiffs' arguments call for a wholesale rethinking of the United States' relationship with Indigenous nations and their people.\n\nThat said, it is far from clear that even this Supreme Court will sign on to this attempt to repeal a longstanding federal law. Although a federal trial court struck down huge swaths of the ICWA , that opinion was authored by Judge Reed O'Connor, a notoriously partisan judge best known for his failed efforts to repeal the entire Affordable Care Act and to insert himself into the top of the military's chain of command .\n\nEven the archconservative Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals believed that O'Connor went too far, and a majority of its judges voted to reinstate several key provisions of the ICWA .\n\nIt's also worth noting that Justice Neil Gorsuch, a Trump appointee who typically votes with the Court's most reactionary members in politically charged cases, tends to vote with the Court's liberal minority in cases involving federal Indian law. Assuming Gorsuch continues that pattern in Brackeen , that most likely means the plaintiffs need to hold on to all five of the Court's other Republican appointees to prevail.\n\nIt is possible, in other words, that at least five justices will vote to uphold the Indian Child Welfare Act in its entirety.\n\nNevertheless, the stakes in Brackeen are high. They speak to whether Congress is allowed to take steps to cure grave past injustices - a project this Court has been hostile toward in the past .\n\nSince the very earliest days of the American republic, the Constitution has been understood to give Congress the broadest authority to set the United States' policy toward American Indians, and to regulate its relationship with the tribes. As Secretary of War Henry Knox wrote to President George Washington in 1789, \"the United States have, under the constitution, the sole regulation of Indian affairs, in all matters whatsoever .\"\n\nThe Supreme Court, meanwhile, has repeatedly said that this power derives from the Constitution's commerce clause , which permits Congress \"to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes\" (although some decisions suggest that other provisions of the Constitution permit Congress to regulate Indian affairs as well). And it has emphasized that Congress's power over Indian affairs is \"plenary,\" or absolute.\n\nThat said, one oddity of the Supreme Court's jurisprudence is that it has often read the scope of Congress's power to \"regulate commerce ... with the Indian tribes\" more broadly than its power to \"regulate commerce ... among the several states.\"\n\nThe interstate commerce clause - the provision allowing congressional regulation of commerce among the states - is arguably the single most consequential provision of the Constitution because it gives Congress broad authority over domestic economic affairs. The interstate commerce clause is what permits federal lawmakers to enact a minimum wage , to protect workers' right to unionize , and to prohibit discrimination by private businesses , among many other things.\n\nAt least one of the Brackeen plaintiffs, the state of Texas, argues that the interstate and Indian commerce clauses should instead be read to \" mean substantially the same thing .\" They then propose a definition of the word \"commerce\" so narrow that it would erase much of the last 100 years of US law .\n\nIn its now-discredited decision in Hammer v. Dagenhart (1918), the Supreme Court held that Congress was forbidden from banning child labor in the workplace, on the theory that the word \"commerce\" permits Congress to regulate the \"transportation\" and \"sale\" of persons and goods, but not the production of those same goods.\n\nAt least some parts of the Brackeen plaintiffs' briefs appear to argue that Hammer was correctly decided. Texas's brief , for example, claims that the word \"commerce\" was \"originally understood\" to only encompass \"buying, selling, and transporting goods.\" Meanwhile, a second brief filed on behalf of individual plaintiffs who \"sought to foster or adopt children with Indian ancestry\" makes a similar argument, claiming that \"Congress's Indian Commerce Clause power confers only authority to regulate trade with tribes.\"\n\nThis is, of course, the exact same definition of the word \"commerce\" that the Court embraced in its long-since-overruled decision in Hammer .\n\nIt's impossible to exaggerate the sheer chaos that would result if the Supreme Court reinstated the Hammer decision. Such a decision wouldn't simply endanger the ICWA and federal child labor laws, it would abolish huge swaths of federal laws governing the workplace, prohibiting discrimination, and regulating entire industries such as health insurers. It would be as if the Supreme Court picked up the entire United States Code, and just started randomly crossing out huge swaths of it with a black marker.\n\nThat said, it is unlikely that the Court would go that far. Of the Court's current members, only Justice Clarence Thomas has openly suggested that Hammer was correctly decided. Most of the justices appear to have made peace - albeit often an uneasy peace - with the fact that Congress may enact economic regulation on a broad range of subjects.\n\nBut the sheer audacity of the Brackeen plaintiffs' commerce clause arguments should give you a sense of just how little regard they pay to existing law.\n\nOne of the fundaments underlying US relations with American Indian tribes is that those tribes are distinct nations - although the Court has, at times, described Indigenous nations as \" domestic dependent nations \" or \" quasi-sovereign tribal entities \" whose citizens are subject to far more US governmental control than, say, a citizen and resident of France.\n\nLike any nation, tribes generally may decide who they wish to admit as citizens. Some tribes, for example, extend citizenship to the descendants of Black people who were enslaved by members of the tribe, even though these Black tribal citizens may not be blood descendants of the tribe's Indigenous citizens.\n\nIndeed, the reason why I've largely avoided using the term \"Native Americans\" to describe the class of people protected by the ICWA is because doing so could conflate the difference between a Native American racial identity and someone's membership in an American Indian tribe. The ICWA does not apply to all people of Native descent. It applies only to children who are \" a member of an Indian tribe \" or who are \"eligible for membership in an Indian tribe and [are] the biological child of a member of an Indian tribe.\"\n\nWhich brings us to the Brackeen plaintiffs' next argument: that the ICWA is unconstitutional because it discriminates on the basis of race by treating Native children differently than non-Native children.\n\nThe problem with this argument is that the statute emphatically does no such thing. Again, it does not apply to all children of Native American descent. It applies to children who are either members of a tribe or who are eligible for tribal citizenship and have a parent who is a tribal citizen. Under the ICWA, a non-tribal citizen with four Native American grandparents is not governed by the law if their parents were not tribal citizens. Meanwhile, a Black child whose parents are two Black citizens of the Cherokee Nation would fall within the statute unless they were somehow ineligible for tribal citizenship themselves.\n\nAs the Supreme Court held in Morton v. Mancari (1974), federal law may give special treatment to American Indians, so long as that treatment \"is granted to Indians not as a discrete racial group, but, rather, as members of quasi-sovereign tribal entities.\"\n\nThe Brackeen plaintiffs' strongest legal argument rests on a legal doctrine known as \" anti-commandeering .\"\n\nBriefly, this doctrine provides that, if the federal government wants to implement a particular federal policy, it cannot order a state government to do so. For example, while the Trump administration could order federal law enforcement officers to crack down on immigrants, it could not order state and local police to do the same . Similarly, while marijuana possession remains illegal under federal law, states where marijuana is legal are under no obligation to enforce this law. If the feds want to arrest someone for smoking a joint in one of these states, they need to send a federal agent to make the arrest.\n\nThe Brackeen plaintiffs argue that the ICWA violates this anti-commandeering doctrine by dragooning state officials and state courts into the enforcement of a federal policy. As Texas argues in its brief , the ICWA effectively forces state officials to \"provide notices, keep records, locate and retain expert witnesses, and track down Indian families\" in order to comply with federal rules governing child placement disputes involving American Indian children.\n\nBut there are a number of problems with this argument. The first is that, to the extent the ICWA requires state family court judges to rule in certain ways, the Constitution explicitly permits Congress to impose these kinds of obligations on state judges. Article VI of the Constitution states that federal laws \" shall be the supreme Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby .\"\n\nThe Court, moreover, placed some important limits on the anti-commandeering doctrine in Reno v. Condon (2000), which held that this doctrine is not triggered if a law merely requires state officials to \"take administrative and sometimes legislative action to comply with federal standards.\" Under Reno , the doctrine only has force when the federal government requires \"the States in their sovereign capacity to regulate their own citizens.\"\n\nThink of it this way: the federal government can't order a state police officer to arrest an individual for violating federal marijuana law, because that would amount to ordering a state to use its own resources to regulate the state's own citizens. But, once a state has made the decision to arrest someone for violating a marijuana law, the federal government can regulate how that arrest goes down and how the criminal suspect is treated without running afoul of the anti-commandeering principle.\n\nSimilarly, the ICWA does not require any state government to remove any child from their home. It merely provides that, if the state decides to bring a custody proceeding involving an American Indian child, then this custody proceeding must comply with the rules laid out in federal law. That's the very sort of federal law which Reno said was permissible.\n\nAll of which is a long way of saying that the plaintiffs' legal arguments in Brackeen are quite aggressive, and they call for the Supreme Court to make several departures from longstanding law - at least some of which could have hugely disruptive consequences for millions of Americans and for countless federal laws.\n\nThis Supreme Court does not feel particularly bound by existing law . And it has shown particular skepticism toward federal laws enacted to cure past injustices against marginalized groups - hence the Court's declaration in Shelby County v. Holder (2013) that much of the Voting Rights Act should be deactivated because \"things have changed in the South\" since the Act was originally enacted to eliminate Jim Crow restrictions on voting.\n\nThat said, there are some reasons for proponents of the ICWA to remain optimistic. Thus far, the lower court judges who've attacked the ICWA have largely been drawn from the most reactionary voices on the federal bench. And a majority of the current Supreme Court does sometimes run out of patience for Judge Reed O'Connor's especially partisan approach to interpreting federal law.\n\nBut no one can be truly confident that any precedent is safe in this Supreme Court until a majority of the Court's current members vote to uphold it. So we won't know for sure whether the ICWA is itself safe until the Court rules in Brackeen .\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

It's people who we descended from.\n\nOne Oneida ancestor's remains were stolen from the Oneida Indian Nation's lands outside Syracuse, New York, in 1898, according to a repatriation notice in the federal register , and sold to a collector who later gifted them to the museum, where they have been sitting in archives for more than 100 years.\n\nWith the help of new federal guidelines, Halbritter said his ancestor is finally coming home.\n\n\"Coming here and being closer to this person who used to be alive... is a bit of an emotional feeling, but a good feeling, because they're coming home,\" Halbritter told ABC News.\n\nAcross the country, Native American tribes are struggling to reclaim what was stolen from them over centuries: the remains of their ancestors and personal sacred items, now held in museums, universities and other institutions that are often far from home.\n\nDespite federal legislation passed nearly 35 years ago aimed at correcting this cultural appropriation and theft, an ABC News investigation found progress has been slow.\n\nUnder the Native American Graves and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), which US President George H. W. Bush signed into law in 1990, any institution that receives federal funding must identify any Native American, Native Alaskan or Native Hawaiian ancestral remains, funerary objects (something placed with individual human remains usually at the time of burial), sacred objects and objects of cultural patrimony in their possession.\n\nNationwide, more than 128,000 Native American ancestors and 4.5 million sacred objects have been identified in collections across museums, universities and government agencies, according to National Parks Service data.\n\nThose numbers don't include more than an estimated 90,000 ancestors and 700,000 associated funerary objects that have not yet been identified in collections.\n\n\"I'm pretty sure my ancestors from long ago did not bury their relatives thinking this was going to be the outcome,\" said Stacy Laravie, a member of the Ponca Tribe of Nebraska.\n\nLaravie is the indigenization director for the National Association of Tribal Historic Preservation Officers (NATHPO), a nonprofit organization devoted to preserving indigenous cultures and identities throughout the U.S.\n\nShe stressed that NAGPRA and the return of ancestors and sacred items is, above all, a civil rights issue.\n\n\"These are not just material things that are sitting somewhere in a museum,\" she said. \"There's still that dehumanization, and we have to explain why this is important.\"\n\nUnder the process called \"repatriation,\" federally recognized tribes can make a claim that those people and objects belonged to their ancestors, and therefore should be returned to tribal lands for proper reinterment and care.\n\n\"Anyone can imagine how they would feel if their relatives were being held in an institution, their bones were being pulverized to do radio-carbon testing,\" Halbritter said. \"What NAGPRA envisioned is to return these people.\"\n\nHowever, critics of the law claim it was passed without any real guidelines for how consultations between tribes and institutions should happen, and what a reasonable timeline for return looked like.\n\n\"We have no idea what they hold in their archives,\" Kandice Watson, the Oneida Indian Nation's lead archivist, told ABC News. \"There's no way that we could start the process. So, we really do have to rely on these universities and their morals and ethics to return these items to their rightful owners.\"\n\n\"We have a new generation of people who are growing up, just finding out this stuff happened. They're horrified,\" Watson said. \"When you're young, a hundred years seems like a long time. But when you get older, you realize that's not that long.\"\n\nInstitutions like the American Museum of Natural History, the Field Museum in Chicago, the Houston Museum of Natural Science and the Fowler Museum in Los Angeles -- all surveyed by ABC Owned Stations -- came into their collections in a variety of ways. Some were purchased, some were donated and some were transferred from other institutions over the years. But all of these collections have one thing in common: they represent a violent history of colonization, replacement and theft.\n\n\"As Western expansion progressed over the United States in the 1700 and 1800s, native peoples were forced to relocate to reservations, and so that meant we had to leave the bodies of our relatives in their graves at home,\" Shannon O'Loughlin, the executive director of the Association on American Indian Affairs, told ABC News. \"We had to leave many of the cultural heritage and ceremonial items that were part of our belief systems, our life ways and our identity that we built over time\"\n\nO'Loughlin has been helping tribes handle legal cases over NAGPRA for more than 20 years.\n\n\"We also at the same time saw a rise in archaeology and anthropology in the study of those peoples and their skeletons, as well as the rise of museology and the exhibition of those same things,\" O'Loughlin said.\n\n\"Many of these items were just simply stolen. They were just plundered and sold,\" Ray Halbritter told ABC News. \"Our limited resources, other incentives people have for profit or for academic ambitions, caused these items to be taken without our knowledge or approval. And now there's a good opportunity however to right the wrong.\"\n\nHalbritter noted that, in recent years, institutions have been working harder to return his ancestors and others. Some of that, he said, was due in part to new regulations that went into effect in January 2024.\n\nUnder the new guidelines, institutions that fall under NAGPRA cannot display Native American, Native Alaskan or Native Hawaiian ancestors or sacred items without permission of descendants, tribes or Native Hawaiian organizations. Institutions also now have 90-day deadlines to respond to repatriation requests and a 5-year deadline to publish updated inventories.\n\nJune Carpenter, the NAGPRA director for the Field Museum in Chicago and a member of the Osage Nation, credited these updates with expediting her work. Before she took on this role at the Field Museum, she said she worked with her tribe to bring ancestors and sacred objects home.\n\n\"The new regulations do establish more ways to establish that cultural affiliation,\" Carpenter said. \"There is another provision that allows if absolutely no determinations can be made, there is still an avenue for return.\"\n\nIn compliance with those new requirements, many exhibits in the Field Museum's Ancient Americas Hall, which encompasses the history of central and North America, including the Northwest Coast and Arctic, are now covered with murals, black boards and butcher paper.\n\nIn some exhibits, entire sections have been removed. Carpenter said she and her staff are working with Native communities to consult about the sacred objects that were on display only a year ago.\n\n\"We may have covered more than we needed, but we need to engage in consultation with the potentially affiliated tribes before we can display those items,\" she said.\n\nCarpenter hopes that someday she will \"work herself out of a job.\" She said every time tribal members come into the Field Museum to visit with their ancestors and sacred objects, she feels a sense of accomplishment.\n\n\"I think seeing your items in the museum collections, it's difficult. It's really difficult,\" Carpenter said. \"But at the same time, you know, it can be fulfilling in a way to be reconnected with those items.\"\n\nSimilarly, what was once the Eastern Woodlands and Great Plains Halls at the American Museum of Natural History is now walled off and converted into a winding hallway with an exhibit offering information about NAGPRA, reckoning with the museum's unethical acquisition practices from years past.\n\nThe American Museum of Natural History told ABC News that Ray Halbritter's ancestor will be returned to Oneida in the coming weeks. ABC News Owned stations confirmed museums in their cities say they are taking similar paths towards repatriation with multiple native tribes.\n\n\"It's a good thing that we're making the right decisions about how these items are going to be treated and returned properly,\" Halbritter said. \"There is going to be, working with Native Americans to help present the information in a way that's respectful, informative. So while it might seem sudden, these walls, it really is a long time coming.\"\n\nHalbritter noted that, in recent years, institutions across the country have returned 90 of his ancestors home to Oneida lands, where they've finally been put to rest.\n\n\"This is just what we're supposed to do, we're supposed to take care of our ancestors, our past, our present and our future,\" Halbritter said.\n\nHe added that the work he does is for future generations.\n\n\"Everything we do is for our children's benefit, that they see a better world where they're respected, their ancestors are respected and treated with appropriate ceremony and respect they deserve,\" he said.\n\nABC7 Chicago's Chuck Goudie contributed to reporting.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

It would end in Fort Laramie, Wyoming, where the treaty was signed.\n\nGetting to Cheyenne River Reservation and its main town, Eagle Butte, entailed flying to Rapid City, South Dakota, then driving three hours to Eagle Butte. Despite a snowstorm, Ivan was waiting to greet me.\n\nThe security team for the ride, some of whom had worked security at the protests, were with him. After Standing Rock, some of them moved down the Missouri River to the Lower Brule Reservation, where they \"could live like their ancestors, except with Netflix,\" Alton One Feather Sr. explained.\n\nThe next morning, Lookinghorse, his friend Uma, the six-member security team and I drove the snow-packed roads to the tiny community of Green Grass.\n\nOther organizers from the Standing Rock and Pine Ridge Reservations arrived. We climbed a hill and, hand in hand, formed a circle, turned to the four cardinal directions and shared a pipe while Lookinghorse sang a Lakota song. Lakota ceremonies cannot be photographed or taped because they are sacred, so documenting various aspects of the ride could be difficult.

It would end in Fort Laramie, Wyoming, where the treaty was signed.\n\nGetting to Cheyenne River Reservation and its main town, Eagle Butte, entailed flying to Rapid City, South Dakota, then driving three hours to Eagle Butte. Despite a snowstorm, Ivan was waiting to greet me.\n\nThe security team for the ride, some of whom had worked security at the protests, were with him. After Standing Rock, some of them moved down the Missouri River to the Lower Brule Reservation, where they \"could live like their ancestors, except with Netflix,\" Alton One Feather Sr. explained.\n\nThe next morning, Lookinghorse, his friend Uma, the six-member security team and I drove the snow-packed roads to the tiny community of Green Grass.\n\nOther organizers from the Standing Rock and Pine Ridge Reservations arrived. We climbed a hill and, hand in hand, formed a circle, turned to the four cardinal directions and shared a pipe while Lookinghorse sang a Lakota song.

      "text": "Tensions Mount as Native American Tribe Fights to Block Oil Pipeline\n\nProtests turned violent over the weekend in North Dakota.\n\n&#151; -- A multibillion-dollar pipeline being built through land claimed by Native Americans to be culturally sensitive has sparked outrage, protest and heartbreak among tribe members who say sacred sites are being \"bulldozed.\"\n\nA judge ordered a temporary halt to construction on part of the 1,172-mile Dakota Access pipeline after tensions between protesters and workers escalated over the weekend. Witnesses say private security workers unleashed pepper spray and pit bulls on a crowd of men, women, and some children who were protesting the pipeline over the weekend. But authorities say the protesters became aggressive, nearly overwhelming the workers and security at the construction site. The Morton County Sheriff's Office told ABC News that three workers were injured by protesters; tribal officials reported that 30 protesters were hit with by pepper spray and 12 more were bitten by dogs.\n\nIt was an escalation following months of demonstrations over the controversial pipeline whose fate will be decided in court later this week.\n\n\"These were grave sites and these were these people's ancestors buried here,\" Dallas Goldtooth, who said he witnessed the protest, told ABC News. \"What happened on Saturday was that Dakota Access bulldozed right through a sacred site.\" Goldtooth added that the conflict escalated quickly when Dakota Access workers plowed through what was believed to be a newly discovered sacred site on private land before state officials could come and survey the area.\n\nThe tribe also expressed deep concern in court docs for potential contamination to their drinking water supply.\n\nConstruction for the Dakota Access pipeline began about a half mile north of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe reservation in North Dakota earlier this summer. Dakota Access then voluntarily halted some construction after the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe filed a lawsuit, claiming that the Army Corps of Engineers had not adequately consulted them before granting permits to the builder.\n\nLawyers for the Army Corp of Engineers and Dakota Access argued in court documents that they complied with a standard review process. A judge will rule in the case by this Friday, but in the meantime members of the tribe have been protesting the construction in other areas they say are also sacred sites, like the one where Saturday's incident took place. Construction there has now been halted as well after the tribe sought a temporary restraining order following this past weekend's clash.\n\nWyn Hornbuckle, a Justice Department spokesperson, told ABC News today that he could not comment on behalf of the Army Corp of Engineers for a case that is still in litigation, but that the Army Corps supported the temporary restraining order that the tribe sought following Saturday's incident.\n\n\"As stated in the filing by the United States, the Army Corps acknowledges that the public interest would be best served by preserving peace near Lake Oahe until the Court can rule on the Tribe's motion for preliminary injunction, and therefore does not oppose the Tribes' request for a temporary restraining order,\" Hornbuckle said in an email.\n\nDakota Access says on its website that it expects the pipeline will transport about 470,000 barrels of oil every day from North Dakota's Bakken and Three Forks production areas through South Dakota, Iowa and into Illinois, while also creating thousands of construction jobs and generating millions in tax revenue for those four states. \"The pipeline will enable domestically produced light sweet crude oil from North Dakota to reach major refining markets in a more direct, cost-effective, safer and environmentally responsible manner,\" the website says.\n\nBut Native American leaders argue they were not adequately consulted regarding the pipeline's route, and they are concerned for the environmental consequences and the impact on groundwater.\n\n\"Native Americans throughout history have been the stewards of the land and we have been warning mainstream America about the destruction that they are doing and that it is not going to last,\" Tribal Chairman David Archambault II of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe told ABC News. \"We have to protect the water, we have to protect the earth from destruction.\n\n\"What we are concerned about is our future generations, our youth, and what we do today is going to impact them,\" Archambault, who spoke to ABC News prior to Saturday's incident, added.\n\nBut the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe's problem with the pipeline goes beyond environmental concerns, Archambault said, explaining that the pipeline's route goes through Native American sacred sites.\n\n\"Our culture and our spirituality is tied to Mother Earth,\" Archambault said. \"In order for our kids to have an identity of who they are, our ancestors left significant sites for us,\" he added, saying that the construction process so far has shown a complete disregard for these culturally and spiritually significant sites.\n\n\"It is time that indigenous lands be recognized by the federal government and the corporate world,\" said Archambault, who emphasized prior to this weekend that the demonstrations against the pipeline have been peaceful. Archambault has not responded to ABC News' request for comment following Saturday's incident.\n\nBut Donnell Preskey, a spokesperson for the Morton County Sheriff's Department, told ABC News that Saturday's protest was not peaceful.\n\n\"The people involved in the protest have been saying that this is a peaceful event. What we're saying is that what happened on Saturday is in no way a peaceful event. They trespassed,\" Preskey told ABC News. \"There were 300 protesters and only 14 private security officers.\"\n\nPreskey added that some of the protesters were armed with sticks or flagpoles, and although no arrests have been made, the whole incident is still under investigation.\n\n\"Some of the misconceptions that are out there is that the construction is happening on the reservation. It is happening on private landowners' properties and they have given the right to Dakota Access pipeline,\" Preskey said, adding that the protest has put law enforcement in a difficult situation.\n\n\"Dakota Access pipeline has every legal right to be doing the work that they are doing. As law enforcement, our job is to make sure that they can do their work safely and that protesters can protest safely. Law enforcement has been caught in the middle.\"\n\nGoldtooth said that the protesters were just trying to prevent a sacred site from getting demolished. \"They went and tried to stop the bulldozers,\" he said. \"They went up to the fence with their hands up trying to stop them. ... It was kind of chaotic ... [but] after a while people backed up.\"\n\nDakota Access did not respond to ABC News' request for comment.\n\nLast week, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe received support from the United Nations Chair of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues Alvaro Pop Ac, and Dalee Dorough and Chief Edward John, members of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, who said that the tribe's actions may be \"misunderstood.\"\n\n\"Thousands of indigenous peoples from different nations have gathered in the Sacred Stone Spirit camp, in North Dakota, to block construction of the pipeline. Actions such as these tend to occur in different parts of the world and are often misunderstood and described as rebellious, backward thinking and unilateral opposition to development,\" the statement said.\n\n\"For indigenous peoples, the environment is a living entity that contains our life sources as well as our sacred sites and heritage. The environment is an important part of our lives and any threats to it impacts our families, ancestors and future generations. It is therefore imperative that the United States respects and recognizes the intrinsic, inter-related rights of Sioux and their spiritual traditions, history, philosophy, and especially their rights to their lands and territories,\" the U.N. group continued. \"The world is watching what is happening in North Dakota.\"\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
