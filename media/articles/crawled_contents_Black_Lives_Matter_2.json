      "text": "GOP rep calls to strip power from DC and for Black Lives Matter Plaza to be 'paved over'\n\nOne House Republican who has long sought to curtail Washington, D.C.'s sovereignty is now pushing for President-elect Donald Trump to help him not only tighten Congress' screws on D.C.'s elected government, but also wants to erase one of the city's most high-profile racial justice monuments.\n\nAccording to the Daily Caller , Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-Ga) is planning to introduce a bill to further put the nation's capital city even further under the thumb of Congress by drastically transforming the \"home rule\" policy that currently governs the city. And he told the publication he's also seeking to eliminate Black Lives Matter Plaza on 16th and K Street Northwest, reverting the street back to its initial design.\n\nAs Destination D.C. (the official tourism website for Washington, D.C.) notes on its website , Black Lives Matter Plaza was inspired in the wake of the nationwide protests that followed the killings of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Minnesota and Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky at the hands of police. After a massive protest at Lafayette Square was met with tear gas and a violent response by riot police, local artists painted the phrase \"Black Lives Matter\" on the street across from the White House. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser and the D.C. City Council made the installation permanent and blocked the road from non-pedestrian traffic.\n\n\"I would think that that is something that we should do. You have a street that is blocked off. It should not be blocked off. You have businesses that are negatively affected by it and they shouldn't be negatively affected by it,\" Clyde said. \"The Black Lives Matter movement in and of itself should be All Lives Matter, not just Black Lives Matter, but All Lives Matter.\"\n\n\"So in that respect, I don't agree with this. And the fact that the city spent almost $5 million on it is an incredible waste of money. And then to maintain it, another waste of money,\" he added. \"So, honestly, the street needs to go back to the way it was, which is a public thoroughfare and the Black Lives Matter wording needs to be paved over.\"\n\nClyde pointed out that Article 1, Section 8, Clause 17 of the U.S. Constitution gives Congress jurisdiction over D.C. Currently, Congress has a time limit to strike any laws that the city passes. But under Clyde's legislation, no legislation D.C.'s elected government passes would go into effect without the explicit blessing of Congress. D.C. has run afoul of Congress in the past, as a ballot measure legalizing recreational marijuana within city limits was overridden by Congress .\n\n\"President Trump said that he planned on cleaning up the city,\" Clyde told the Caller . \"We're going to help him do that.\""

Nonetheless, compliance problems with the querying of Section 702 information have proven to be persistent and widespread. If they are not substantially mitigated by these recent measures, it may become necessary to consider other responses, such as substantially limiting the number of FBI personnel with access to unminimized Section 702 information.\"\n\nThe Post reports :\n\nBuilt in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the database has long been considered by U.S. officials to be one of the prize jewels of the national security apparatus. Its primary purpose is targeting foreign intelligence or terrorism information. But the sweeping nature of the information in the database has long worried civil rights advocates, who argue that the government has proved it cannot be trusted to use the system carefully.\n\nDespite the \"fixed\" issue, the court \"has pressured the FBI, writing in the April 2022 opinion that was unsealed Friday that if the agency doesn't perform better, the court will crack down and order its own changes to FBI surveillance practices.\"\n\nSenior law enforcement officials told The Post Friday \"the problems in the report do not represent the FBI's current practices,\" and reiterated they have since \"been remedied.\"\n\nA official added, \"We're not trying to hide from this stuff, but this type of noncompliance is unacceptable.\"\n\nThe Washington Post's full report is available at this link (subscription required)."

      "text": "The Proud Boys and Black Lives Matter clashed in this Florida town - and only BLM faced charges: report\n\nSome members of the far-right Proud Boys are facing criminal charges in connection with the January 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol Building, but the Proud Boys were violent long before that. When huge protests erupted all over the United States following the brutal killing of George Floyd on May 25, 2020, the Proud Boys went out of their way to harass Black Lives Matter and antifa activists. But when the Proud Boys and BLM protesters clashed in New Port Richey, Florida during the Summer of 2020, there was a key difference: according to Washington Post reporter Tim Craig, only BLM protesters faced any charges.\n\nThe Proud Boys, in 2020, could have simply let progressive protesters have their say while holding demonstrations of their own; instead, they went out of their way to be confrontational and went looking for trouble. New Port Richey, a Tampa suburb, was one of the places where the Proud Boys tried to bully BLM protesters.\n\nCraig, in an article published on February 2 , explains, \"When local Black Lives Matter activists started marching through the small, coastal town of New Port Richey, Fla., last summer - shouting slogans through bullhorns demanding racial justice - it took only a few days for the Proud Boys and other counterprotesters to show up and confront them. Burly groups of mostly White men encircled the demonstrators. They revved motorcycles while yelling threats, obscenities and support for the police and President Trump, at times using their own bullhorns.\"\n\nIn response, Craig notes, New Port Richey officials began enforcing an anti-noise ordinance - and BLM protesters were the only ones cited. One of them was 32-year-old Christina Boneta, who was arrested in late August 2020 and fined $2500.\n\nBoneta told the Post, \"We were harassed (by the counterprotesters). We had a few guns brandished on us.... One guy even came up to me and flashed a White power gesture in my face, but they didn't get any noise violations. We are the ones who got the noise violations when, all summer long, we never threatened anybody, looted anything or burned anything.\"\n\nIn early January, police in New Port Richey dropped the noise charges against Boneta and six other BLM activists. But the fact that they were charged in the first place while members of the Proud Boys were not raises questions about the treatment of left-wing activists by police and the courts compared to far-right extremists - especially in light of the violent insurrection that the Proud Boys, QAnon supporters and various militia groups were a part of on January 6. Right-wing media outlets have been promoting the nonsense conspiracy theory that members of antifa stormed the U.S. Capitol Building that day, but even House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy , according to Axios' Jonathan Swan, bluntly told Trump that antifa had nothing to do with that attack.\n\n\"It's not antifa, it's MAGA,\" McCarthy told Trump. \"I know. I was there.\"\n\nIn Florida, Craig notes, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and others Republicans have been \"pushing for a sweeping state bill to crack down on disruptive protests, creating new classes of crimes that include up to 15-years in jail if police declare that nine or more people have participated in a riot.\" And the Post reporter adds that \"similar legislation has proliferated through statehouses around the country in recent years in response to racial justice demonstrations.\"\n\nOn January 27, Florida-based activists offered testimony against the DeSantis-supported anti-protest bill. One of them, Arlinda \"Tray\" Johns, testified, \"We just want to know: was it written on the same parchment paper that the slave codes were written on? Because to us in the Black Community, this feels very Jim Crowish.\"\n\nAttorney James Shaw, Jr., an ACLU attorney who has represented Boneta, has major problems with the bill and told the Post, \"Make no mistake about it: the legislation was proposed in direct reaction to the Black Lives Matter movement, and to throw a bone to a certain voting bloc that was distressed by this movement and wanted to use violence against it.\"\n\nMarlowe Jones, a Florida-based BLM activist, told the Post that members of the Proud Boys and others on the far right went out of their way to be confrontational last year. According to Jones, \"They would surround us, calling us communists and calling us (racial epithets), and calling us socialists.\""

      "text": "Black Lives Matter protests can drive Trump and Pence out of power - If we demand it\n\nWe have arrived at a turning point in history.\n\nMillions of people have risen up for Black Lives and a societal reckoning with America's racist past and present. This struggle must continue and grow. But it won't advance, and could well be thrown back in horrendous ways, unless Trump and his regime are removed from power.\n\nThe forces cohered around Trump see this as their last chance to entrench their vision of society in a rapidly changing world. For those who want an America where white supremacy, male supremacy, Christian supremacy and American jingoism remain unchallenged for generations to come, Trump has proven to be a perfect bully, willing to pull out all the stops to enforce and consolidate their power. These months of protests and the regime's attempts to criminalize and suppress them have largely backfired, bringing even more people into the streets as we've seen in Portland. That is the kind of dynamic that can drive tyrants out of power, but we must face the somber reality that movements that seem unstoppable can be crushed. The righteous protests that rocked Hong Kong last year were set back as soon as the ruling powers were able to use COVID-19 to re-seize the initiative.\n\nImagine the consequences of that happening here. What does it mean that the beautiful uprising for Black Lives has been met with more racist rhetoric about \"thugs and criminals,\" with federal forces added to the violence local police already unleash on Black and brown people? What else could it mean when Trump calls statues memorializing the Confederacy our \"sacred heritage\"? What kind of open terror and how much violence would it take to send Black and Brown people, women and LGBT people, and others who dared to fight for their liberation over the last fifty years back to their pre-1960s \"place\"? Shouldn't the president who calls the words \"Black Lives Matter\" a hate symbol be removed from power by the power of the people?\n\nRefuse Fascism has been in the streets since January, 2017 to sound the alarm that there are fascists in the White House. We have also been in the streets joining the uprising for Black Lives after George Floyd's murder, and have seen an instinctive recognition and rejection of Trump's racism and cruelty. While these protests did not start out as a repudiation of Trump, a growing number of people we have met during this uprising, many of them young and finally feeling their collective power to shape their own futures, understand that Trump stands in the way of their progress.\n\nThese months of sustained protests have done more to reset the terms of debate on white supremacy than years of relying on normal channels. But we have to go further. The Movement for Black Lives, recognizing the danger of allowing Trump to remain in power, added Trump's resignation to its list of demands. This should be backed up with more protests and chanted loudly at the Get Your Knee Off Our Necks March on Washington on August 28. And a week later, on September 5, all who care about humanity and every movement for justice should join the nationwide protests Refuse Fascism is calling for to demand Trump Pence Out Now. Imagine what could be made possible if we unite now, with great urgency, to amplify all demands for the removal of the regime before it can steal, sabotage, or cancel the elections.\n\n2019 saw massive protests around the globe, but the U.S. was quiet while a fascist regime put immigrants in concentration camps, emboldened white supremacist terror, trampled on the rights of LGBTQ people, called journalists the \"enemies of the people,\" and eviscerated environmental protections. Now we are awake. The energy that millions of people, from many different nationalities, backgrounds, and political beliefs, brought to the streets across this country after the horrific murder of George Floyd, and the determination that thousands brought to the streets of Portland to stand strong against Trump's storm troopers, can and must become the force to remove Trump and Pence from power.\n\nThis is exactly the dynamic that has driven out hated regimes all over the world. As we write this, Lebanon has driven out another ineffectual prime minister, and Belarus has erupted in massive protests in the midst of a fraudulent election. Why should we do any less here?\n\nWe have everything to lose if we wait, and everything to gain if we build on our strength in the streets and get Trump's deranged hands off the levers of power and the nuclear button. This would radically change the political, social and moral terrain - as the movements of the 1960s did - and open the door to the possibility of real change.\n\nThis is a moment to seize. Two futures are facing off. Which one we get is up to us.\n\nCoco Das is a writer and editor for RefuseFascism.org, a movement of people coming from diverse perspectives, united in our recognition that the Trump/Pence Regime poses a catastrophic danger to humanity and the planet, and that it is our responsibility to drive them from power through non-violent protests that grow every day until our demand is met.\n\nJamel Mims is a bilingual rapper, multimedia artist, and activist with Refuse Fascism and the Revolution Club.

He responded, \"Well this whole thing is because of them (n-words) down in Detroit.\"\n\nWhen Bob Joyce, the commission's chair, told Eckerle he couldn't say that, Eckerle said, \"I can say anything I want. Black Lives Matter has everything to do with taking the country away from us.\"\n\nLet's be clear: the social aims listed on the Black Live Matters (BLM) website do not mention white people. According to its website, the BLM movement seeks to unite Black communities worldwide to oppose state-sanctioned violence and anti-Black racism while also create creating healing, empathetic communities free from prejudice.\n\nWhen asked about his comments during a Thursday interview with Interlochen Public Radio , Eckerle said didn't realize the public found out about his comments and said, \"No, I don't regret calling it an (n-word). A( n-word) is a (n-word) is a (n-word). That's not a person whatsoever.\"\n\nEckerle also told the Associated Press, \"I'm not a racist. Black Lives Matter is racist. If I believed in Black Lives Matter, I would be racist. ... Black Lives Matter has no heart. And that is as offensive to me as the N-word,\" before saying the actual n-word again, just to make his point.\n\n\"If I could get a few people that, when they see a Black Lives Matter sign up, to think the N-word, I have accomplished what I'm after,\" he added.\n\nEckerle was elected to his eight-year position in 2018.

      "text": "'We don't see color,' Trump supporters say as they tell their kids to fear Black Lives Matter\n\nMost of Donald Trump's supporters don't think they're racists. They don't think Trump is racist, despite his well-documented, decades-long history of racism. And that's the thing: Too many white Americans have defined racism down to the point where an active KKK member might not make the cut.\n\nThe Washington Post 's Robert Klemko talked to Trump supporters outside his Tulsa rally last month, looking at Black Lives Matter protesters, and found a series of cases in point -people claiming not to be racist while telling the children and grandchildren accompanying them things about race and anti-racist protest that would not be out of place in a \"how to raise a racist\" manual.\n\nRacial colorblindness was big with the Trump supporters- as it remains with too many liberals . But here's a great example of how flawed that ideology is, coming from a man who said of protesters that \"I don't think they even understand what they want.\" Why doesn't he think protesters know what they want? \"Because black lives do matter. Every life matters. I have lots of white friends and black friends. I'm out in the oil field. We don't see color. You either work, pull your weight, or you go home. There's no color.\"\n\nThat's it in a nutshell: \"I don't see color\" and \"all lives matter\" come from the same place. It's a place of refusal to acknowledge that the system doesn't operate exactly the same for everyone, and that those differences bear in any way on how we see the world around us.\n\nIt's the worldview that turns virtually anything Black Lives Matter protesters do into an example of violence, no matter what. One woman, there with her grandson, told Klemko the protesters \"were parading around fairly peacefully. Their speech wasn't necessarily peaceful.\"\n\nThe protesters' behavior was peaceful, but that wasn't enough. Speech that made this woman uncomfortable was quickly filed under the category of violence. The same woman really wanted to talk about Democrats and the KKK in the pre-Civil Rights era, by the way, rather than talking about any more recent examples of racism. Like, say, any of dozens of things Donald Trump has said.\n\nAnother man, there with his granddaughter, watched a white man jump out of a truck and pepper-spray Black protesters, then said \"I'll just tell her it's wrong the way they're doing things.\" As in, the protesters, not the guy with the pepper spray. \"Violence is not the answer; it's not the way we grew up learning about the history of our country.\" Again, the violence he thought he saw came from the protesters, not from the guy with the pepper spray.\n\nBut this father may have taken the cake. Jeff Brown was outside the Trump rally selling flags such as \"an Oklahoma flag with the Osage Nation buffalo-skin shield mashed up with the Confederate battle flag\" or saying \"Trump 2020: Make Liberals Cry Again.\" His view of the Confederate flag? He used to think it represented slavery, but \"I have since learned a lot of other variations of the history,\" so \"I think that it's allowed for people to have their own interpretations from their family and their experience.\" His 12-year-old son was with him, wearing a T-shirt saying \"LGBT\"-where the L was for the Statue of Liberty, the G was for guns, the B was for beer, and the T was for Trump.\n\n\"Joshua's going to have to form his own opinions,\" Brown said. \"In our family, we use our brains.\" We can take issue with the idea that any brain use has been involved in moving from the historically accurate view that the Confederate flag represents slavery to concluding that hey, reasonable minds can disagree about whether the flag of a nation formed to defend slavery , a flag resurrected decades later as pushback to civil rights efforts, in fact represents slavery. But the idea that Brown wants his son to form his own opinions is even more questionable here. Joshua is home-schooled. What about keeping a kid at home to be educated solely by his parents says \"we're looking for him to form his own opinions\"?"

      "text": "Police Reform Means Nothing Without Equality and Dignity\n\nThe following is an adapted excerpt from the new book The Making of Black Lives Matter: A Brief History of An Idea by Christopher J. Lebron (Oxford University Press, June 2017), available from Amazon and IndieBound :\n\nOscar Grant, Shereese Francis, Rekia Boyd, Kendrec McDade, Tamon Robinson, Shantel Davis, Jonathan Ferrell, Jordan Baker, McKenzie Cochran, Eric Garner, John Crawford, Michael Brown, Tanisha Anderson, Ezell Ford, Kajieme Powell, Akai Gurley, Tamir Rice, Dontre Hamilton, Bettie Jones, Roy Nelson, Tiara Thomas, Alonzo Smith, Anthony Ashford, Tyree Crawford, Samuel Dubose, Sandra Bland, Walter Scott, Natasha McKenna, Alton Sterling, Philando Castile.\n\nThis list is far from complete. In fact, it's short by hundreds of names that are the damning evidence of the level of violence against black bodies in America. What you might find shocking is that the hundreds of names missing do not span a century or even decades of American history. Rather, the list I've provided begins in 2012. And it is missing the one name we might look back upon from some future vantage point as the most important in the history of today's racial struggle: Trayvon Martin.\n\nThe story of the movement that seeks to redeem a nation begins with Martin. The evening of February 26, 2012, Martin was walking through a Sanford, Florida community wearing a hoodie and holding only a soft drink and some candy. George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, deemed Martin suspicious and called the police though Martin had not actually done anything actionable-his only possible crime seemed to be walking while black. Though advised by the 911 operator to stand down and keep his distance, Zimmerman initiated a confrontation that resulted in a scuffle that ended with him shooting seventeen-year-old Martin dead. Despite Martin's younger age, weight, and size disadvantage, and the all-important fact that he was unarmed, his character quickly became the center of speculation and conversation-he was a black teenager wearing a hoodie, walking through someone else's neighborhood; if Zimmerman suspected him, he must have been suspect-worthy. It came as a surprise to some in America when, in the summer of 2013, Zimmerman was found not guilty on all charges related to Martin's death. It was at this moment that Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi made history. As Garza states on the website bearing the movement's name, \"I created #BlackLivesMatter with Patrisse Cullors and Opal Tometi, two of my sisters, as a call to action for Black people after 17-year-old Trayvon Martin was posthumously placed on trial for his own murder and the killer, George Zimmerman, was not held accountable for the crime he committed.\" Thus, it was the death and failure of our justice system to account for the unnecessary death of a black American that prompted three women to offer these three basic and urgent words to the American people: black lives matter.\n\nToday, #BlackLivesMatter has become a force demanding change in America. Eschewing traditional hierarchical leadership models, the movement cannot be identified with any single leader or small group of leaders, despite the role Cullors, Tometi, and Garza played in giving us the social movement hashtag that will likely define our generation. Rather, #BlackLivesMatter represents an ideal that motivates, mobilizes, and informs the actions and programs of many local branches of the movement. Much like the way a corporate franchise works, minus revenue and profit, #BlackLivesMatter is akin to a social movement brand that can be picked up and deployed by any interested group of activists inclined to speak out and act against racial injustice.\n\nThere is no doubt that the movement itself is historically momentous, even if it remains unclear as of this writing the level of policy efficacy #BlackLivesMatter has been able to bring to bear on the problem of racial justice. Indeed, it is precisely because of the nascent and formative status that I resisted writing directly on the movement. I did not, nor do not as of this writing perceive a space or opportunity to say something sufficiently systematic and helpful about the movement on which so many black Americans are pinning their hopes. Yet, there is something undeniably powerful about those three words: black lives matter. Yes, it is true that they were brought into our political existence at a moment marked by tragedy and unjustifiable losses of black life. That alone makes those three words a touchstone for our American lives today-the struggle to insist that black lives are indeed lives and therefore not candidates for cursory or careless or hateful or negligible elimination. The problem as I saw it from the perspectives of a citizen, a black Latino man, and a scholar was to honor the moment in which we find ourselves, at the helm of which is a movement that seeks to finally undo this nation's murderous racial history. This is a history that spans and reaches like a weed across centuries. Indeed, the only way, I think, to appropriately reflect on this moment that seeks once and for all to place black Americans on a level of human equality with whites is to treat the #BlackLivesMatter movement as intelligent, enduring, and politically savvy. As a trained political philosopher, I had no way of directly engaging the movement given its short life. The Black Power generation had in the sharp and brave tome penned by Kwame Ture and Charles Hamilton, Black Power , a published manifesto and theoretical edifice. In contrast, no such text exists to provide the philosophical moorings of #BlackLivesMatter.\n\nThis realization provides the central aim of my book The Making of Black Lives Matter . As I had turned those three words over in my mind-black lives matter-and read them in news stories and heard them spoken by commentators and friends, it became clear the three words themselves, as distinct from the particular strategies and agents of the movement, indicated a sentiment that was as old as the desire to be free from slavery. From the point of view of my own professional training, \"black lives matter\" represents a civic desire for equality and a human desire for respect, the intellectual roots of which lie deep in the history of black American thought. And precisely because the history is rich and established, I perceived an opportunity to contribute to our moment by bringing to bear the forefathers and foremothers of black American social and political thought on an urgent claim: that black Americans are humans, too. Precisely because blacks' struggle for human acknowledgment is centuries old, what can those who have been on the front lines in the past teach us about our present ideas about the struggle? Indeed, since the struggle is as old as America itself, are we equipped with the right kind of ethos to make our present-day social movements as effective as they can and need to be?\n\n[...]\n\nAmerica was at a crucial junction in the middle of the nineteenth century. The institution of slavery had been the backbone of the nation's social order and economic logic, yet it was coming under increasing pressure from abolitionists, who tirelessly pressed slave owners and non-slave-owning observers of the institution to accept that America was involved in a great crime against humanity. Moreover, abolitionists defiantly argued that slavery betrayed the very ideals of America's democratic founding. Into this scene stepped the self-emancipated Frederick Douglass. Douglass's charge, as he saw it, was to bring the perspective of servitude and inhumane suffering to the American people and compel them to confront the hypocrisy of their political associations and institutions. As slavery died, a virulent form of white supremacy moved to fill the void emancipation had left in America's racial power structure. Jim Crow was a social system of segregation and subordination. At its least malignant it advocated for the principle of separate but equal accommodations for white and black Americans. But the very minimal moral embodied in even that principle was a sham. Rather, the great sin of Jim Crow was lynching-the murderous license white Americans exercised in extrajudicially terrorizing and executing black Americans. Ida B. Wells, after having been forced to flee her hometown under threat of violent retribution for exposing lynching, developed into a great American journalist and activist. In the span of a handful of years of observing the deficiencies in both our laws and media coverage of white terrorism against blacks, Wells became and remained into the twentieth century America's leading voice against white America's murderous predilections. Douglass's and Wells's struggles and ideas are our first engagement with the history of the idea \"black lives matter.\"\n\nBlack art has always been and remains a pillar of black political expression. Though widely derided among conservative whites and even some blacks, gangster rap like that produced by the west coast group N.W.A. has as part of its roots statements against police brutality. The present uses of black urban performance make a stand for social progress, going back to a foundational moment in black arts and letters-the Harlem Renaissance. This engagement is challenging. In the Harlem Renaissance, also known as the era of the New Negro, we have a truly fresh and transformative historical moment with a great many players overlapping, interacting, collaborating, disagreeing, competing to define the future of American democracy through artistic expression. Two important figures of note are Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston. The first, Langston Hughes, was present at the beginning of the movement Alain Locke helped to initiate. Through his poetry and essays he resisted the elitism that sometimes threatened to and did at times define the Renaissance. Hughes's work is deeply important for democratic thinking given his allegiance to the beat, cadence, and texture of the lives of everyday \"low down\" folk, as he admiringly rather than disdainfully called them. In this regard, Zora Neale Hurston is the second important partner in this conversation. She, like Hughes, affirmed the value of common and mundane experiences, such as setting out for a day of work at the railroad. Similarly, Hurston championed the importance of black women's expressive capacities in both intellectual and artistic life. This combination of commitments urged Hurston in the direction of cataloguing and performing black folklore in service to excavating the voice of black Americans. For Hurston, black life mattered in part because it served as an ongoing chronicle of the modes of personal and civic engagement black people employed in refusing to be completely determined by oppression.\n\nFrom The Making of Black Lives Matter: A Brief History of An Idea by Christopher J.

      "text": "Dolly Parton says 'of course' she supports Black Lives Matter\n\nDolly Parton is arguably one of the most universally beloved Americans. Whether it is her music or acting, her charity work or just general public appearances, Parton has always seemed to exist in a very rare space in the American imagination. Coming from the southern-inspired and often conservative world of country music, Parton has been able to continually put her foot down for what she believes in, with considerably less backlash than other performers in her genre . In a new Billboard story released on Thursday, the 74-year-old Parton was asked about the murder of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nParton said that while she has not attended any marches, she fully supported the movement. \"I understand people having to make themselves known and felt and seen. And of course Black lives matter. Do we think our little white asses are the only ones that matter? No!\"\n\nAs the Billboard story mentions, Parton's strong, diverse, and unwavering support comes from her consistency. She's always been a very open Christian woman, but she has also been very consistent in her \"judge not, lest you be judged\" positions on everything from LGBTQ rights to race. \"All these good Christian people that are supposed to be such good Christian people, the last thing we're supposed to do is to judge one another. God is the judge, not us. I just try to be myself. I try to let everybody else be themselves,\" she told Billboard's Melinda Newman.\n\nParton renamed her Dixie Stampede dinner attraction just Stampede in 2018 , after criticisms that the show was insensitive in its sanitized depiction of the Confederacy. As she told Billboard , \"\"When they said 'Dixie' was an offensive word, I thought, 'Well, I don't want to offend anybody. This is a business. We'll just call it The Stampede.' As soon as you realize that [something] is a problem, you should fix it. Don't be a dumbass. That's where my heart is. I would never dream of hurting anybody on purpose.\"\n\nOne can ask more of Dolly, pmaybe more of a statement. But being able to admit a mistake-and trying to rectify it-goes a long, long way with most people."

      "text": "How a Black Lives Matter leader started a 'freedom school' summer program for kids\n\nMiddle- and upper-income parents know that summers are an opportunity to give one's children the sort of well-rounded education that can enhance future college applications. Summer camp rosters fill up months in advance, and price tags for enrichment programs can run upwards of $500 a week. This is especially true in high-priced Southern California, where I live and where Jasmine Abdullah Richards started the Black Lives Matter Pasadena Freedom School, a free, three-days-a-week summer camp for children who live in her neighborhood.\n\n\"Freedom School is for the 'hood. It's for low-income families,\" she explained as we sat together on the Metro train heading from the Los Angeles-area suburb of Pasadena to the California African American Museum near downtown LA. We shouted to be heard by one another through our COVID-19 face masks and over the din of more than a dozen Black and Brown children aged 9 through 15 who were wearing their new Freedom School T-shirts and chatting animatedly with one another. Many had never before been on a train or left the borders of Pasadena. Interrupting our conversation, Richards warned the raucous and excited children to keep it down, yelling, \"Hey, hey, hey, we gotta lower it down just a little bit.\"\n\nRichards has led the Pasadena chapter of Black Lives Matter (BLM) since 2014, when I first met her alongside Patrisse Cullors, co-founder of BLM, for an in-person interview about the Ferguson uprising in Missouri. Both Cullors and Richards had just returned from Ferguson, where the latest chapter in the movement for racial justice was blazing into existence. Richards called that trip an \"eye-opening experience,\" and said that \"Black Lives Matter changed my life.\" A year later, she was confronting Pasadena police over their fatal shooting of a young Black man in her neighborhood named Kendrec McDade and protesting alongside McDade's mother, Anya Slaughter. She has since been on a mission to ensure no more mothers lose their children to police violence, and Freedom School is one effort to that end.\n\nSeventeen-year-old Emoni Waiters and 20-year-old Amari Stewart are both graduates of the first session of Freedom School that Richards organized in 2018. Both young women are now working as camp counselors with Richards to guide a new generation of neighborhood kids and expose them to sights and sounds they might not otherwise have access to. Waiters confessed that before she attended the school, \"I would just sit at the park and hang out. I would get into bad stuff.\" But then, \"when Jasmine started the Freedom School, it was a way for me to get away and do nothing but positive things.\" Stewart had a similar experience. \"It changed me a lot,\" she said. \"Jasmine taught us how to speak to others so you can make a good first impression.\"\n\nIndeed, 'Auntie Jasmine,' as the children call her, dished out sage advice to her camp attendees during the museum field trip every chance she got. While waiting for the train to arrive, she asked the kids, \"So, how many of you know about gangs?\" The mask she wore muffled her voice, and one little boy who mistook what she said responded excitedly, \"oh, I got all games on my phone!\" \"G-A-N-G-S,\" Jasmine spelled out patiently, unmasking her face for a moment. An older Latino boy answered, \"I don't know anything about gangs.\" \"Yes, you do, Gustavo,\" she countered, looking him straight in the eye. \"Let me tell you about my experience in gangs,\" she said and went on to share her own story.\n\nRichards' family moved to Pasadena when she was seven, and she grew up north of the 210 freeway, where most of the city's low-income Black and Brown residents live and where Pasadena police officers routinely patrol. \"My neighborhood was a 'zero-tolerance zone,' so even if we wanted to hang out in front of my apartment, we were considered a gang member,\" she told me. When she was 14, Richards' older brother, who eschewed gangs, was murdered in a drive-by shooting. The trauma of losing her brother left her reeling, and she spiraled into drug and alcohol abuse.\n\nGetting involved in BLM changed everything, and today Richards is clean and sober and in a healthy relationship with herself and her partner. Freedom School \"gives me purpose, it gives me life,\" she said. \"I get them at a young, impressionable age when they can either go left or right, and if I have anything to do with it, I want them to go the right way.\" She sees her work with the school as central to her BLM-related activism, saying, \"there is no revolution without the kids.\"\n\nThe obstacles arrayed against low-income Black and Brown children are immense. Many of the kids enrolled in Freedom School have had routine and terrifying encounters with the police in their neighborhood. Seventeen-year-old Runnit, a Freedom School attendee, is one of them. He said that Freedom School teaches kids, \"that we're not supposed to be afraid when the police show up.\" He's grateful for the opportunities that the program has given him and his young cousin Jaden, who accompanied him on the museum trip. \"She's [Richards has] been doing good stuff for our kids and taking them to places where kids can really be kids. We meet up at the park. We ride the bus safely as a group-we all got shirts on to show that we're in a group.\"\n\nLearning how to interact with the police is part of Freedom School's curriculum. \"Don't run, even if the police talk to you,\" said Richards to the kids during another one of her impromptu lectures on the train. \"If you steal something, you stop with the thing you stole [indicates throwing it to the ground] and say, 'here, I don't even want it, take this shit back.' Don't ever run. Don't run, or they will shoot you.\" It was a version of \" the talk \" that generations of Black parents have had to give their children to best ensure their odds of survival, and an informal version of the \"know your rights\" trainings that Richards includes as part of the camp curriculum.\n\nBut Richards wants more than survival for her neighborhood children. \"I want to get them to start lovin' on themselves and [teach them] how to iron out their own problems because all they see is gang-banging and stuff.\" On the choice of the California African American Museum, she said, \"Representation matters. I want them to see stories of people like them.\"\n\nRichards sees Freedom School as following in the tradition of the Black Panther Party's Breakfast Program . While she started the program in order to fill a void in Pasadena-city-run summer programs this year are not free of charge-the camp seems to have grown into a far more stimulating experience for the children than anything the city might be offering.\n\nEleven-year-old Jaden was buzzing with so much excitement about the prospect of visiting the museum that he could hardly stand still. \"I came here today because my mom wanted me to know about my culture and my history, about what we did in the past,\" he said. Illustrating just how much impact Freedom School has already had on him, he expostulated, \"all the white people, they raised us as slaves and let us pick cotton and they whipped us, and it was bad and hurtful. That's why we're here today to learn about everything that we have in our history.\"\n\nOrganizing programs like Freedom School costs money, and Richards, ever the innovator, has made something out of nothing, tapping into her own social network and her national reputation to raise thousands of dollars for the program. She earned that profile the hard way. In 2016 she made headlines for becoming the first African American ever to be convicted on a charge of \" felony lynching \" in connection with intervening in a police arrest in her neighborhood. Richards said she had been on the police's radar for months, facing constant harassment from officers.\n\nToday she has turned the national reputation that the police inadvertently bestowed upon her into what she calls \"social capital.\" Proud of what she has accomplished, she delighted in the fact that \"tons of people are giving money, all my followers on Facebook , Instagram , just random people,\" as she asks them to \"help me help my 'hood.\" Using the donations, she has purchased branded T-shirts for the camp enrollees to wear on field trips, train and museum tickets, and bathing suits for swim days. She is also paying the two Freedom School graduates, Waiters and Stewart, to be camp counselors.\n\nRichards has bigger plans for her neighborhood kids beyond Freedom School. When Victor Gordo ran for Pasadena mayor last year, she met with him demanding that he act like a civil servant. \"I told him, 'if we vote for you, bro, I need you to do something for our community.' So that's what he vowed to do.\" Gordo won the mayor's race and has agreed to work with Richards on a city-level apprenticeship program for graduating teens, such as Waiters, who will be attending a welding program at Pasadena City College in the fall. Not one to rest on her laurels, Richards said, \"I told him, 'I'm not gonna stop the pressure on you. If you don't do these things, then you gotta go too.'\"\n\nIn using all the tools at her disposal, including her political sensibility, life experiences, fundraising prowess, adeptness at holding politicians accountable, and the trust that her neighbors have placed in her, Richards offers a model for progressive change that places children at the forefront.\n\nSonali Kolhatkar is the founder, host and executive producer of \"Rising Up With Sonali,\" a television and radio show that airs on Free Speech TV and Pacifica stations.

D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced the change last week in response to pressure from Republicans in Congress. The work is expected to take about six weeks and the words will be replaced by an unspecified set of city-sponsored murals.\n\nThe painting of those words was an act of government-sponsored defiance during President Donald Trump's first term. The removal amounts to a public acknowledgement of just how vulnerable the District of Columbia is now that Trump is back in the White House and Republicans control both houses of Congress.\n\nFrom the top of a building, Kanon Kennedy, of Washington, looks down at the Black Lives Matter mural as demolition begins, Monday, March 10, 2025, in Washington.

The devastating impacts of the federal job cuts must be our number one concern.\"\n\nThe move shows Bowser's striking shift in tone toward Trump and congressional Republicans since the president's first term in office. Bowser, a Democrat, ordered the painting and renamed the intersection Black Lives Matter Plaza as a public act of defiance in June 2020. It came after days of chaotic protests at that location over police brutality following the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer.\n\nHer approach to the protests brought her into direct conflict with Trump. The president at the time accused Bowser of losing control of her city and threatened to invoke his power to take over the Metropolitan Police Department. He didn't follow through but declared his own multiagency lockdown that included helicopters flying at low altitudes to intimidate protesters.\n\nIn Trump's second stint in the White House, Bowser has worked to avoid conflict and downplay any points of contention. She traveled to Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate to meet with president after his election and has publicly emphasized their points of agreement, such as a mutual desire to return federal workers back to their offices full time.\n\nTrump recently revived a frequent campaign talking point about wanting a federal \"takeover\" of the nation's capital, describing Washington as riddled with crime, graffiti and homeless encampments. Bowser has refused to comment on reports that the White House was preparing an executive order targeting Washington; she publicly said that the greatest threat to the so-called Home Rule autonomy was \"some of the people in Congress.\"\n\nRepublicans, who control both chambers of Congress, have repeatedly threatened to interfere in city affairs in large and small ways. A measure currently before Congress, named the BOWSER Act , seeks to completely revoke the Home Rule Act of 1973 that grants the capital city limited autonomy.\n\nThat would be a deeply controversial, likely testing the strength of the three-seat GOP House majority. Some representatives have used budget riders to target Washington policies ranging from marijuana legalization to whether right turns on red lights should be legal. And some in Congress have spoken publicly of their disdain for the Black Lives Matter street painting.\n\nWhile Bowser and Trump agreed on returning federal workers to their offices, Trump's push to slash the federal workforce is already roiling city finances. A report last week from the city's chief financial officer predicted a $1 billion budget shortfall over the next three years due to the loss of thousands of workers from the federal government.\n\nBowser publicly siding with Black Lives Matter activists in 2020 didn't earn her much credibility with them at the time. The local Black Lives Matter affiliate dismissed the move as \"performative wokeness\" and decried Bowser as overwhelmingly biased toward police. The same activists heaped scorn on Bowser on Tuesday following her reversal.\n\nNee Nee Taylor, a founding member of the D.C. Black Lives Matter affiliate, addressed Bowser on X on Tuesday, saying, \"You never cared about Black Lives Mattering. You painting those words were performative.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast, File)\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement hits a milestone on Thursday, marking 10 years since its 2013 founding in response to the acquittal of the man who fatally shot 17-year-old Trayvon Martin .\n\nGunned down in a Florida gated community where his father lived in 2012, Martin was one of the earliest symbols of a movement that now wields influence in politics, law enforcement and broader conversations about racial progress in and outside the U.S.\n\nBLM activists and organizations plan to mark a decade of the movement with in-person and virtual events. Calls to action include a renewed push to defund police departments and reinvest in Black communities that have suffered disproportionately from police brutality, unequal treatment in criminal justice systems and mass incarceration.\n\nIn the wake of Supreme Court decisions that stymied relief from student loan debt held disproportionately by Black borrowers and banned affirmative action in higher education, the need for BLM's existence couldn't be more clear, said prominent movement activist Melina Abdullah.\n\n\"What this movement moment means is that we have to absolutely redouble our efforts and redouble our commitment to making Black lives matter,\" said Abdullah, who is a director of BLM Grassroots Inc, a collective of organizers across the country.\n\n\"Ten years in, we're getting a glimpse at what would happen if there were no Black Lives Matter,\" she said. \"We're not just going to fight when it's popular, but we're going to fight because we need to fight.\"\n\nIn Los Angeles on Saturday, the \"#BLMTurns10 People's Justice Festival\" will be held in Leimert Park, a historic neighborhood and cultural hub for Black Los Angelenos. The festival is designed to feel like a village and will include a pop-up garden dedicated to families of people killed by police and white supremacist violence.\n\nFestival organizers have invited Sybrina Fulton , Martin's mother, to speak. Scholar and activist Dr. Cornel West, who is running for U.S. president as a third-party candidate in 2024, has been invited to give the festival's keynote address.\n\nTrayvon Martin's parents, Tracy Martin, foreground left, and Sybrina Fulton, foreground center, and the family's lawyer, Bemjamin Crump, background center, participate in the Million Hoodie March for Trayvon Martin in New York's Union Square. (AP Photo/John Minchillo, File)\n\nThe BLM movement first emerged in 2013, after the acquittal of George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer of mixed white and Hispanic heritage who killed Martin a year earlier. Zimmerman claimed to authorities that he acted in self-defense when he shot Martin. He also acknowledged to an emergency dispatcher that he had followed and profiled the Black teen as a potential burglar in the Sanford, Florida, gated community.\n\nMartin's encounter with Zimmerman, as well as the delay in arresting and charging the gunman in the killing, raised questions about how police handle suspected acts of vigilantism against Black victims. In 2012, former President Barack Obama, the nation's first Black commander-in-chief, underscored public concerns over fairness in the case when he said: \"If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.\"\n\nOn July 13, 2013, a Florida jury of six women, all but one of them white, found Zimmerman not guilty of second-degree murder or manslaughter. The immediate response to the verdict reverberated in Florida and across the U.S., energizing a new generation of Black racial justice groups including the Dream Defenders and BYP100.\n\nBLM co-founders Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza and Ayo Tometi - the three activists are credited with using the phrase as an affirmation and an organizing strategy - initially pledged to build a decentralized organization governed by the consensus. The August 2014 shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown at the hands of police in Ferguson, Missouri, helped the phrase \"Black lives matter\" become a potent rallying cry for progressives and a favorite target of derision for law enforcement unions and political conservatives.\n\nA woman with a shirt with Trayvon Martin's face on it that reads \"No Justice, No Peace\" stands at the \"Justice for Trayvon\" rally in Chicago. (AP Photo/Scott Eisen, File)\n\nBut just three years into its existence, all but one of the founders remained involved in the movement's burgeoning organization. And in 2020, an unprecedented wave of donations to the movement following protests over George Floyd's murder by Minneapolis police meant that BLM needed more infrastructure.\n\nAmid disputes with grassroots activists about the direction of the movement organization, the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation Inc. has been steward over a charitable endowment worth tens of millions of dollars . BLM Grassroots Inc. operates separately.\n\nThe foundation is marking the 10-year BLM anniversary with the launch of the campaign it's calling Defund the Police Week of Action. On Monday, it released a digital ad renewing 2020 rallying cries for defunding police departments. The organization is also encouraging supporters to ask local and national elected officials to introduce a draft proclamation that establishes July 13 as \"Black Lives Matter Day.\"\n\n\"As we continue our push to defund the police, invest in Black communities and reimagine safety in our communities, we need our elected officials to focus on the people, not police,\" BLM foundation board member D'Zhane Parker said in a statement.\n\n\"The safest places around the world don't have more police, more jails, more prisons, or harsher sentences,\" she said. \"They have better access to economic opportunities, quality education, stable housing, and health care.\"\n\n___\n\nAaron Morrison is a New York-based member of AP's Race and Ethnicity team.

(Robert Cohen/St. Louis Post-Dispatch via AP)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - On May 28, 2020, Associated Press photographer Julio Cortez got a call asking him to head to Minneapolis from the East Coast. What he saw on the ground was unlike any protest he'd ever covered. It was then that he knew something had shifted in the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nCortez is one of three AP staff members featured in this episode of The Story Behind the AP Story, a recurring audio production that features extended interviews with AP journalists discussing their stories and process.\n\nThis episode includes two journalists on the scene in Minneapolis, Cortez and AP reporter Steve Karnowski. And AP race and ethnicity editor Aaron Morrison provides analysis of the coverage and looks into the reckoning on race in America.\n\nAP correspondent Haya Panjwani reports on the reporters on the ground during pivotal moments of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\n___\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE - Over the next few weeks, The Associated Press will publish a series of stories exploring the impact, legacy and ripples of what is widely called the \"Ferguson uprising\" that sparked nationwide outcries over police violence and calls for broader solutions to entrenched racial injustices. The series provides a sprawling look at racial justice in American life, from stories about how the uprising changed the U.S. Department of Justice and how corporations sought to boost their profiles by donating to the movement, to examinations of a reckoning on race in schools, churches, politics, sports and public health.\n\n___\n\nHAYA PANJWANI, host: Ten years ago, the death of a Black teenager named Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, sparked a racial reckoning. Protests broke out in the suburban city, eventually becoming what some deemed as ground zero for the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nA few years later, in 2020, George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis, bringing further attention to the movement.\n\nI'm Haya Panjwani. On this episode of The Story Behind the AP Story, we'll be hearing from two reporters.\n\nJULIO CORTEZ, photographer: Julio Cortez, chief photographer for the Texas and Oklahoma region of the Associated Press.\n\nSTEVE KARNOWSKI, reporter: I'm Steve Karnowski. I'm a reporter in the Minneapolis bureau of the Associated Press.\n\nPANJWANI: Julio photographed the demonstrations that followed the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis in 2020, while Steve followed the legal proceedings.\n\nKARNOWSKI: That was a very scary time. Minneapolis hasn't seen that kind of unrest in a generation. Not since the '60s, really, have we had full scale riots here. So, it was very disturbing to see that happening in your own city.\n\nCORTEZ: I had seen on TV what was going on. It looked very involved, very fluid, very dangerous. When I got the call the morning of May 28 to get deployed into Minneapolis, start seeing things for myself. It was much more intense in person than it was on TV.\n\nI was very scared for many reasons, not just because of the violence, but also this is right in the middle of a pandemic. So, I was really afraid of catching something and never coming home.\n\nYou know, as a person of color covering these events, I feel things that maybe the community is feeling. I can sympathize, I can understand what's going on. While I'm trying to do my job as objectively as possible, I am feeling some of that anger, and I don't let those feelings dictate how I photograph. But I do use those feelings to kind of reflect in the images what's going on and what, what we're seeing.\n\nNinety-nine percent of the protests I've ever covered were not violent. I worked for the AP in New Jersey for almost nine years, so I did a lot of New York City, NYPD protests up and down Manhattan. They were aggressive, but I never saw the sort of violence that I saw in Minneapolis.\n\nKARNOWSKI: After George Floyd was killed, and word spread and anger grew - besides peaceful but angry protests, rioting broke out in parts of the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, which is something that we hadn't seen before.\n\nIt resulted in not just windows being broken, but it culminated with the burning of the police station where the officers involved in this had been based.\n\nCORTEZ: People were very angry and showing a lot of emotion. The protests had taken a new meaning in America. It was no longer picket signs and, and people peacefully walking places. It was people taking on a very aggressive approach to voice what they felt.\n\nKARNOWSKI: Another factor that probably influenced things was the pandemic. People had been cooped up during lockdowns and that kind of thing. So, all this kind of played out against that background.\n\nPANJWANI: Julio and his colleagues won a Pulitzer Prize for breaking news photography for his coverage of those Minneapolis protests. His photo shows a protester carrying a United States flag upside down as a sign of distress next to a burning building on March 28, 2020.\n\nCORTEZ: I was just using the American flag as a visual aid to give me a sense of place. I'm a journalist first, but I'm also a historian, and I often look at the history behind images. And so, the flag has always been part of the conversation. We see it in Iwo Jima. We see it at 9/11 at ground zero. The astronauts putting it on the moon.\n\nPANJWANI: Ten years of racial reckoning. What now?\n\nAARON MORRISON, editor: The death of Michael Brown a decade ago is really a marker because it signaled a real turning point, not just in how we talked about police brutality in the U.S., but it also signaled the emergence of a younger new generation of racial justice activists.\n\nPANJWANI: That's Aaron Morrison, the race and ethnicity editor for the Associated Press.\n\nMORRISON: You knew the names Rev. Al Sharpton, Rev. Jesse Jackson. You knew the NAACP and the National Urban League. But when this generation stepped forward and said, we don't need those groups, we can speak for ourselves. We don't need our parents or grandparents to respond for us. We are going to respond for ourselves. That is why this is worth marking and remembering. And then taking stock of what impact it has had over the last decade. Because it's not just Black Lives Matter and you know, advocate for African Americans. The emergence of this generation's racial justice movement and reckoning around race inspired other groups to also begin their own reckonings. It's helped people to see where they can step up. And that doesn't always mean street protests. Sometimes it's meant the classroom. It's meant the boardroom. It's meant the halls of Congress.\n\nKARNOWSKI: This has had a lot of political implications here. The balance of power in Minneapolis has changed a bit. While the mayor at the time, Jacob Frey, was reelected, the city council here has become increasingly more progressive and more diverse. And we've ended up with probably the most diverse legislature in our history here between people of color, LGBTQ people, women holding office and that sort of thing.\n\nPANJWANI: For many, racial issues are still a source of pain and deep emotion.\n\nCORTEZ: You know, they're not out there for fun. They're out there because they strongly believe that they've been handed very bad cards, and they want to act on it.\n\nKARNOWSKI: Certainly, forced a lot of deep thinking on the parts of a lot of people. And so, it has led to things like changes at the political level. These are still very raw issues for a lot of people.\n\nMORRISON: Those protests were not just protesters vs. police. This was a proxy or a symbol for the ways in which people could find themselves launching an activism that worked for them.\n\nIt's not just the unarmed Black man. It's now much more inclusive in who is being advocated for, who is being fought for, and what things are being fought for. It's multiracial. It's not just black/white.\n\nJAIME HOLGUIN, producer: This has been the story behind the AP story. For more on this story, visit APNews.com .\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

One is of Michael Brown.\n\nBrown's death 10 years ago in Ferguson, Missouri, was a defining moment for America's racial justice movement . It cast a global spotlight on longtime demands for reforms to systems subjecting millions of people to everything from economic discrimination to murder.\n\nActivists like Bush went from proclaiming \"Black Lives Matter\" to running for seats in statehouses, city halls, prosecutors' offices and Congress - and winning. Local legislation has been passed to do everything from dismantling prisons and jails and reforming schools to eliminating hair discrimination .\n\nRep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., speaks to an Associated Press reporter in her office at Capitol Hill in Washington, Thursday, Sept. 19, 2024. (AP Photo/Ben Curtis)\n\nAt least 30 states and Washington, D.C., have enacted laws meant to curb abusive conduct since 2020, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. While the last decade of racial justice activism transformed politics, landmark reforms remain elusive, more than three dozen activists, elected officials and political operatives told The Associated Press.\n\n\"As we look at the strides we've made, it ebbs and flows,\" said Bush, a longtime community organizer and pastor before becoming a Democratic representative. \"We're still dealing with militarized policing in communities. We're still dealing with the police shootings.\"\n\nFILE - Protesters appeal to motorists for support while rallying on Aug. 11, 2014 in front of the QT gas station in Ferguson, Mo. that was looted and burned during rioting overnight that followed a candlelight vigil honoring 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was shot on Aug. 9, 2014 by Ferguson police officers. (AP Photo/Sid Hastings)\n\nAs the new generation of Black activists wielding cellphones rewrote the national conversation on policing, questions of public safety and racial justice pushed into the center of American politics. Police body cameras are widespread. Tactics including chokeholds have been outlawed.\n\nFerguson prompted a change in how communities tackle police reform and misconduct, said Svante Myrick, who was the youngest-ever mayor of Ithaca, New York, from 2011 to 2021 before becoming president for People for the American Way, a progressive advocacy group.\n\nAt least 150 reforms passed in localities and states.\n\nFILE - People defy a curfew on Aug. 17, 2014, before tear gas was fired to disperse a crowd protesting the shooting of teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel, File)\n\n\"I know that someone's life was saved, that there was an officer, that there was an encounter where a police officer could have made a different decision had there not been 400 days of protest during the Ferguson uprising,\" Bush said. \"Maybe the world was waking up to the fact that it can't just be an outside strategy, there has to be an inside strategy as well.\"\n\nFILE - Tishaura Jones speaks during a news conference on Aug. 5, 2020, in St. Louis.

A 2016 memo from the Democratic Party's House campaign arm told politicians to limit the number of Black Lives Matter activists at public events, or meet privately.\n\nFerguson marked a new phase. For perhaps the first time, a visible mass protest movement for justice for a single victim was born organically - not convened by clergy members or centered in the church - and often linked by mobile phones and sustained by hip-hop .\n\nBrown's death and the treatment of Black Lives Matter protesters also led many Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders to an internal reckoning . Organizations and individuals of all ages were galvanized to get off the sidelines.\n\n\"We've had gains,\" Bush said. \"I wanted to bring the movement into the House of Representatives, and I feel that I've been able to do that.\"\n\nBy 2015, Ferguson activists were welcomed into the White House to work on the Obama administration's Task Force for 21st Century Policing .\n\nWhile Donald Trump embraced some criminal justice reforms like the First Step Act , he remained opposed to racial justice activists throughout his administration. The movement was met with scorn on the right. In 2016, the then-Republican presidential nominee called Black Lives Matter \"divisive\" and blamed President Barack Obama for worsening race relations nationwide.\n\nTrump was president during the racial justice protests that emerged in the summer of 2020 following Floyd's killing. During protests, he posted , \"When the looting starts, the shooting starts.\" He signed an executive order encouraging better police practices but that was criticized for failing to acknowledge what some consider systemic racial bias in policing.\n\nDuring a 2017 speech in New York , Trump appeared to advocate rougher treatment of people in custody, speaking dismissively of the police practice of shielding handcuffed suspects' heads as they're placed in patrol cars.\n\nTrump's election caused many racial justice activists to shift focus from individual police departments to how federal policies fund and protect police misconduct.\n\nFILE - A protester carries a U.S. flag upside down, a sign of distress, next to a burning building on May 28, 2020, in Minneapolis. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez, File)\n\nThe movement was again thrust into politics when Chauvin murdered Floyd in May 2020.\n\nThe protests upended American politics and shocked even many who′d spent years advocating for policies that were suddenly in the mainstream - community response teams, restrictions on police tactics, redirecting police funding.\n\nFloyd's relatives appeared at the 2020 Democratic National Convention; the following year, Democrats introduced a bill that would've enacted sweeping reforms.\n\nFILE - Protestors demonstrate outside of a burning Minneapolis 3rd Police Precinct, on May 28, 2020, in Minneapolis. (AP Photo/John Minchillo, File)\n\nThe George Floyd Justice In Policing Act would have banned chokeholds and no-knock warrants, like the one that led to Louisville police killing Breonna Taylor in her home. It also would have created a database listing officers disciplined for gross misconduct.\n\nThe House passed it in 2021. The Senate failed to reach a consensus.\n\nElla Jones didn′t see herself running for office before the Ferguson protests. A minister and entrepreneur, Jones felt called to protest Brown's killing but said local Democratic leaders told her to run for Ferguson mayor. She won a City Council seat, and was eventually elected mayor.\n\n\"You can stand outside and scream at the system. However, you must be at the table where policy is made,\" Jones said. \"Some people may go into politics. Some people may go into establishing nonprofits, but it's going to take all of us working together to make the change.\n\n′′You have to be at the table, where policy is made.\"\n\nFerguson's prosecuting attorney, Wesley Bell, was on a promise to tackle police misconduct.\n\nFILE - In this July 29, 2019 file photo, St. Louis County Prosecutor Wesley Bell speaks during an interview in Clayton, Mo.

(AP Photo/Brynn Anderson)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - The foundation started by organizers of the Black Lives Matter movement is still worth tens of millions of dollars, after spending more than $37 million on grants, real estate, consultants, and other expenses, according to tax documents filed with the IRS.\n\nIn a new, 63-page Form 990 shared exclusively with The Associated Press, the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation Inc. reports that it invested $32 million in stocks from the $90 million it received as donations amid racial justice protests in 2020. That investment is expected to become an endowment to ensure the foundation's work continues in the future, organizers say.\n\nIt ended its last fiscal year - from July 1, 2020 to June 30, 2021 - with nearly $42 million in net assets. The foundation had an operating budget of about $4 million, according to a board member.\n\nThe tax filing shows that nearly $6 million was spent on a Los Angeles-area compound. The Studio City property, which includes a home with six bedrooms and bathrooms, a swimming pool, a soundstage and office space, was intended as a campus for a Black artists fellowship and is currently used for that purpose, the board member said.\n\nThis is the BLM foundation's first public accounting of its finances since incorporating in 2017. As a fledgling nonprofit, it had been under the fiscal sponsorship of a well-established charity, and wasn't required to publicly disclose its financials until it became an independent, 501(c)(3) nonprofit in December 2020.\n\nThe tax filing suggests the organization is still finding its footing: It currently has no executive director or in-house staff. Nonprofit experts tell the AP that the BLM foundation seems to be operating like a scrappy organization with far fewer resources, although some say Black-led charities face unfair scrutiny in an overwhelmingly white and wealthy philanthropic landscape.\n\nStill, its governance structure makes it difficult to disprove allegations of impropriety, financial mismanagement and deviation from mission that have dogged the BLM foundation for years, one expert said.\n\n\"It comes across as an early startup nonprofit, without substantial governance structure in place, that got a huge windfall,\" said Brian Mittendorf, a professor of accounting at Ohio State University who focuses on nonprofit organizations and their financial statements.\n\n\"People are going to be quick to assume that mismatch reflects intent,\" he added. \"Whether there's anything improper here, that is another question. But whether they set themselves up for being criticized, I think that certainly is the case because they didn't plug a bunch of those gaps.\"\n\nThe BLM movement first emerged in 2013, after the acquittal of George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Florida. But it was the 2014 death of Michael Brown at the hands of police in Ferguson, Missouri, that made the slogan \"Black lives matter\" a rallying cry for progressives and a favorite target of derision for conservatives.\n\nBLM co-founders Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza and Ayọ Tometi had pledged to build a decentralized organization governed by the consensus of BLM chapters. But just three years into existence, Cullors was the only movement founder involved in the organization.\n\nAnd in 2020, a tidal wave of contributions in the aftermath of protests over George Floyd's murder by Minneapolis police meant the BLM organization needed much more infrastructure.\n\nWhen Cullors revealed the windfall of donations last year, local chapter organizers and families of police brutality victims reacted angrily. Until then, the foundation had not been transparent with the most devoted BLM organizers, many of whom accused Cullors of shutting them out of decisions about how financial resources would be allocated.\n\nYahNé Ndgo, an activist and former organizer with the BLM chapter in Philadelphia, said Cullors reneged on a promise to hand over control of the foundation's resources to grassroots organizers.\n\n\"When resources came in, when opportunities came in, (the foundation) alone would be the ones to decide who was going to take advantage of them, without having to take any consideration of the other organizers whose work was giving them the access to these resources and opportunities in the first place,\" said Ndgo, who organized a group of chapters that confronted the foundation over issues of transparency and accountability.\n\nIn 2020, the foundation did spin off its network of chapters as a sister collective called BLM Grassroots. It has a fiscal sponsor managing money granted by the foundation. Melina Abdullah, cofounder of BLM's first chapter in Los Angeles, also directs the grassroots collective and said its organizers continue to have direct impact in communities across the country.\n\n\"We'll never stop doing that,\" Abdullah said. \"That's the work we were born out of.\"\n\nIn a recent interview with the AP, Cullors acknowledged the foundation was ill-prepared to handle the moment. The tax filing lists Cullors as an uncompensated founder and executive director. She resigned last year. The foundation also paid nearly $140,000 in severance to a former managing director who had been at odds with local BLM chapter organizers, prior to Cullors's tenure as director.\n\nThe filing shows Cullors reimbursed the organization $73,523 for a charter flight for foundation-related travel, which the organization says she took in 2021 out of concern for COVID-19 and security threats. She also paid the foundation $390 over her uses of the Studio City property for two private events.\n\nDuring the last fiscal year, Cullors was the foundation board's sole voting director and held no board meetings, according to the filing. Although that is permissible under Delaware law, where the foundation is incorporated, that governance structure gives the appearance that Cullors alone decided who to hire and how to spend donations. That was never the truth, current board members said.\n\nFor all the questions raised about its oversight, the BLM foundation's tax filing shows its stewards haven't squandered donations. Instead, it granted tens of millions of dollars to BLM chapters, Black-led grassroots organizations and families of police brutality victims, whose names rallied the larger movement.\n\n\"This 990 reveals that (the BLM foundation) is the largest Black abolitionist nonprofit organization that has ever existed in the nation's history. What we're doing has never been done before,\" said Shalomyah Bowers, who serves as the foundation's board secretary.\n\n\"We needed to get dollars out to grassroots organizations doing the work of abolition, doing the work that would shift the moral tide of this world towards one that does not have or believe in police, prisons, jails or violence,\" he said.\n\nEarlier this month, the foundation announced Bowers as one of three members of its board of directors. He serves with board chair Cicley Gay, a communications professional with more than 20 years of experience in nonprofit and philanthropic organizations, and D'Zhane Parker, a member of BLM's Los Angeles chapter whose work focuses on the impact of mass incarceration on families.\n\n\"We are decolonizing philanthropy,\" Gay said. \"We, as a board, are charged with disrupting traditional standards of what grant making in philanthropy looks like. It means investing in Black communities, trusting them with their dollars.\"\n\nThe foundation will launch a \"transparency and accountability center\" on its website to make its financial documents available for public inspection, Bowers said.\n\n___\n\nFOUNDATION RELIES ON CONSULTANTS\n\nTo get here, the foundation has relied on a small grouping of consultants, some of whom have close ties to founders and other BLM organizers. For example, the tax filing shows the foundation paid nearly $970,000 to Trap Heals LLC, a company founded by Damon Turner, who fathered a child with Cullors. The company was hired to produce live events and provide other creative services, Bowers said.\n\nThe foundation paid more than $840,000 to Cullors Protection LLC, a security firm run by Paul Cullors, Patrisse's brother, according to the tax filing. Because the BLM movement is known for vehemently protesting law enforcement organizations, the foundation felt its protection could not be entrusted to former police professionals who typically run security firms, said Bowers, adding the foundation sought bids for other security contractors.\n\nBowers, who has previously served as deputy executive director, is founder and president of a firm that received the lion's share of money spent on consultants in the last fiscal year. Bowers Consulting provided much of the foundation's operational support, including staffing, fundraising and other key services and was paid more than $2.1 million, according to the tax filing.\n\nThe foundation's reliance on consultants is not unusual for newer nonprofits, said Mittendorf, the Ohio State accounting professor. But having clear policies around business transactions could reduce any appearance of impropriety, he said.\n\n\"It's a best practice not to engage in business transactions with people who have influence inside the organization or with companies affiliated with people who have influence inside the organization,\" Mittendorf said. \"Make sure you have conflict of interest policies and other controls in place, so that those transactions are all being done to benefit the organization and not to benefit the individuals.\"\n\nThe tax filing indicates the foundation has a conflict-of-interest policy. And Bowers said the last BLM board approved the contract with his firm when he was not a board member.\n\n\"Our firm stepped in when Black Lives Matter had no structure and no staff,\" he said. \"We filled the gap, when nothing else existed. But let me be crystal clear, there was no conflict of interest.\"\n\nControversy surrounding the organization's finances has elicited probes by at least two state attorneys general. Board members said they are cooperating with civil investigations in Indiana and Ohio, and they have turned over relevant documents to those authorities.\n\nIsabelle Leighton, interim executive director of the Donors of Color Network, an organization that promotes racial equity in philanthropy, said discrimination in the nonprofit sector leaves little room for Black-led progressive movement organizations to publicly make mistakes. Such organizations are typically receiving much less financial and operational support than wealthy, white-led nonprofits, but receive much more criticism, she said.\n\n\"It's tapping into a deep narrative that people of color do not deserve to have the same resources that those who have already made it get,\" Leighton said. \"It's intended for people to start to doubt and create their own new echo chamber of criticizing who deserves to receive resources.\"\n\n___\n\nBLM GRANTS $26 MILLION TO CHAPTERS AND FAMILIES\n\nThe foundation's tax filing rebuts claims that the BLM foundation ignored the larger movement. Nearly $26 million, or 70% of its expenses, were grants to organizations and families in the last fiscal year.\n\nTwelve BLM chapters, including those in Boulder, Colorado; Boston; Washington, D.C.; Detroit; Los Angeles; Gary, Indiana; and Philadelphia, received pledges for grants of up to $500,000. The family foundations created in honor of Floyd and others killed by police and vigilantes - Trayvon Martin and Oscar Grant - each received contributions of $200,000.\n\nJacari Harris, executive director of the George Floyd Memorial Foundation, said in a statement the organization was \"incredibly grateful\" for the grant, \"the largest one-time contribution we have received to date within the U.S.\" Harris said the funds will help provide college scholarships, mental health support to the Black community and educate \"about the dangers of police brutality around the world.\"\n\nThe Michael O.D. Brown: We Love Our Sons & Daughters Foundation, run by Michael Brown Jr.'s mother, Lezley McSpadden, was approved for a larger multi-year grant of $1.4 million. A representative of the Brown foundation told the AP that an initial $500,000 had been received in 2021.\n\nMcSpadden is happy to have the BLM foundation's support, the representative said.\n\nAmong its larger grants are $2.3 million to the Living Through Giving Foundation, a nonprofit charity platform that encourages giving at the local level; and $1.5 million to Team Blackbird, LLC, a rapid response communications and movement strategy project that increases the visibility of movement organizations.\n\nThe tax filing does not reveal the foundation's largest donors.\n\n\"Transparency and accountability is so important to us, but so is trust,\" said Gay, the BLM foundation chair. \"Presenting (donor) names after the fact, at this point, would likely be a betrayal of that trust.\"\n\n____\n\nMorrison writes about race and justice for the AP's Race and Ethnicity team.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - The foundation widely seen as a steward of the Black Lives Matter movement says it took in just over $90 million last year, according to a financial snapshot shared exclusively with The Associated Press.\n\nThe Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation is now building infrastructure to catch up to the speed of its funding and plans to use its endowment to become known for more than protests after Black Americans die at the hands of police or vigilantes.\n\n\"We want to uplift Black joy and liberation, not just Black death. We want to see Black communities thriving, not just surviving,\" reads an impact report the foundation shared with the AP before releasing it.\n\nThis marks the first time in the movement's nearly eight-year history that BLM leaders have revealed a detailed look at their finances. The foundation's coffers and influence grew immensely following the May 2020 death of George Floyd, a Black man whose last breaths under the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer sparked protests across the U.S. and around the world.\n\nThat growth also caused longstanding tensions to boil over between some of the movement's grassroots organizers and national leaders - the former went public last fall with grievances about financial transparency, decision-making and accountability.\n\nThe foundation said it committed $21.7 million in grant funding to official and unofficial BLM chapters, as well as 30 Black-led local organizations. It ended 2020 with a balance of more than $60 million, after spending nearly a quarter of its assets on the grant funds and other charitable giving.\n\nIn its report, the BLM foundation said individual donations via its main fundraising platform averaged $30.76. More than 10% of the donations were recurring. The report does not state who gave the money in 2020, and leaders declined to name prominent donors.\n\nLast year, the foundation's expenses were approximately $8.4 million - that includes staffing, operating and administrative costs, along with activities such as civic engagement, rapid response and crisis intervention.\n\nOne of its focuses for 2021 will be economic justice, particularly as it relates to the ongoing socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 on Black communities.\n\nThe racial justice movement had a broad impact on philanthropic giving last year. According to an upcoming report by Candid and the Center for Disaster Philanthropy, 35% of the $20.2 billion in U.S. funding dollars from corporations, foundations, public charities and high-net-worth individuals to address COVID-19 was explicitly designated for communities of color.\n\nAfter the 2013 acquittal of George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch volunteer who killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Florida, BLM's founders pledged to build a decentralized movement governed by consensus of a members' collective. In 2015, a network of chapters was formed, as support and donations poured in. But critics say the BLM Global Network Foundation has increasingly moved away from being a Black radical organizing hub and become a mainstream philanthropic and political organization run without democratic input from its earliest grassroots supporters.\n\nBLM co-founder Patrisse Cullors told the AP that the foundation is focused on a \"need to reinvest into Black communities.\"\n\n\"One of our biggest goals this year is taking the dollars we were able to raise in 2020 and building out the institution we've been trying to build for the last seven and a half years,\" she said in an interview.\n\nCullors, who was already active in her native Los Angeles, where she created her own social justice organization, Power and Dignity Now, became the global foundation's full-time executive director last year.\n\nFellow co-founders Alicia Garza, who is the principal at Black Futures Lab, and Opal Tometi, who created a Black new media and advocacy hub called Diaspora Rising, are not involved with the foundation. Garza and Tometi do continue to make appearances as movement co-founders.\n\nIn 2020, the foundation spun off its network of chapters as a sister collective called BLM Grassroots. The chapters, along with other Black-led local organizations, became eligible in July for financial resources through a $12 million grant fund. Although there are many groups that use \"Black Lives Matter\" or \"BLM\" in their names, less than a dozen are currently considered affiliates of the chapter network.\n\nAccording to foundation records shared with the AP, several chapters, including in the cities of Washington, Philadelphia and Chicago, were notified last year of their eligibility to receive $500,000 each in funding under a multiyear agreement. Only one BLM group in Denver has signed the agreement and received its funds in September.\n\n____\n\nCHAPTERS CALL FOR MORE TRANSPARENCY\n\nA group of 10 chapters, called the #BLM10, rejected the foundation's funding offer last year and complained publicly about the lack of donor transparency. Foundation leaders say only a few of the 10 chapters are recognized as network affiliates.\n\nIn a letter released Nov. 30, the #BLM10 claimed most chapters have received little to no financial resources from the BLM movement since its launch in 2013. That has had adverse consequences for the scope of their organizing work, local chapter leaders told the AP.\n\nThe chapters are simply asking for an equal say in \"this thing that our names are attached to, that they are doing in our names,\" said April Goggans, organizer of Black Lives Matter DC, which is part of the #BLM10 along with groups in Indianapolis, Oklahoma City, San Diego, Hudson Valley, New York, and elsewhere.\n\n\"We are BLM. We built this, each one of us,\" she said.\n\nRecords show some chapters have received multiple rounds of funding in amounts ranging between $800 and $69,000, going back as far as 2016. The #BLM10 said the amounts given have been far from equitable when compared to how much BLM has raised over the years. But Cullors disagreed.\n\n\"Because the BLM movement was larger than life - and it is larger than life - people made very huge assumptions about what our actual finances looked like,\" Cullors said. \"We were often scraping for money, and this year was the first year where we were resourced in the way we deserved to be.\"\n\nStill, the #BLM10 members said reality didn't match the picture movement founders were projecting around the world. In its early years, BLM disclosed receiving donations from A-list celebrities such as Beyoncé, Jay-Z and Prince, prior to his death in 2016.\n\nLeaders at the BLM foundation admit that they have not been clear about the movement's finances and governance over the years. But now the foundation is more open about such matters. It says the fiscal sponsor currently managing its money requires spending be approved by a collective action fund, which is a board made up of representatives from official BLM chapters.\n\nAfter Floyd's killing in Minneapolis, the surge of donations saw the foundation go from small, scrappy movement to maturing institution. Last summer, leaders sought nonprofit status with the IRS, which was granted in December, allowing the organization to receive tax-deductible donations directly. In the near future, that also will require the foundation to file public 990 forms, revealing details of its organizational structure, employee compensation, programming and expenses.\n\nBrad Smith, president of Candid, an organization that provides information about philanthropic groups, said there are other ways for nonprofits to be transparent with the public besides federal disclosure forms. He said a philanthropic organization's website is its best tool to show how willing it is to be held accountable.\n\n\"In exchange for getting tax exempt status, you as an organization committed to providing a greater level of transparency to confirm you are fulfilling your mission,\" he said.\n\nIt's because of Cullors, Garza and Tometi's vision, along with the work of so many Black organizers in the ecosystem, that the BLM movement finds itself at a new phase of its development, said Melina Abdullah, co-founder of BLM's first ever chapter in Los Angeles.\n\n\"We're turning a corner, recognizing that we have to build institutions that endure beyond us,\" Abdullah told the AP.\n\n____\n\nMorrison is a member of AP's Race and Ethnicity team.

      "text": "Black Lives Matter Just Entered Its Next Phase\n\nMonths removed from the height of nationwide street protests, the movement has arrived at an important juncture, where its next steps will determine its success.\n\nAugust 28 holds significant meaning for many African Americans. This year, it marked the 65th anniversary of the murder of Emmett Till , the 14-year-old Black boy who was lynched by two white men near Money, Mississippi. Till's death served as one of the catalysts for the civil-rights movement, and organizers of the 1963 March on Washington-one of the largest mass demonstrations of the 20th century-selected this date for their gathering. This year was also the 57th anniversary of that march. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, the National Action Network organized thousands of people wearing masks to fill the Mall last Friday and commemorate the march's legacy-and assert a new commitment to fighting injustice . It is not a coincidence that the Movement for Black Lives -a consortium of more than 50 Black-led organizations, including the Black Lives Matter Global Network-also hosted its virtual Black National Convention that Friday evening, where it unveiled its multipronged political agenda on matters of police brutality and beyond.\n\nThe momentum for cultural and political change stemming from the reemergence of Black Lives Matter demonstrations this summer has been extraordinary. Throughout communities across the country, portraits of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor are wheat-pasted on building walls. Signs that read black lives matter are posted in residential and storefront windows, and the words have been painted onto city streets. Statues that venerate racists, segregationists, and Confederates have come tumbling down. Brands and corporations have rushed to acknowledge systemic racism, ranging between strong and lukewarm commitments to addressing structural inequities. The Minneapolis City Council unanimously voted to dismantle its police department. And school districts in Oakland, California , and Madison, Wisconsin , announced plans to terminate their police contracts. But as the end of summer approaches, will this transformative energy last or languish?\n\nSince the height of the protests in June, there's been an absence of a meaningful nationwide embrace of police reforms . That month, President Donald Trump signed an executive order calling for the creation of a national database on police use of force , yet the measure fails to address broader issues related to policing. And while the aftermath of the Jacob Blake shooting by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, may provide renewed pressure on state legislators to act , there's no denying that the largest social movement of the 21st century has to enter a new chapter.\n\nTo that end, at Friday night's convention, the Movement for Black Lives presented a robust 2020 platform, connecting the dots among issues of policing, reproductive justice, housing, climate change, immigration, and disabled and trans rights. In addition to outlining demands to \" end the war on Black people ,\" the platform urges the passage of the Breathe Act , federal legislation that would ensure the closure of Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facilities, defund police departments, and reestablish social programs for the formerly incarcerated. The platform also calls for land reparations for Indigenous communities and Black farmers , electoral justice via the passage of the John Lewis Voting Rights Act , and the advocacy and protection of trans people. The convention was an energetic capstone to a summer of victories both significant and modest.\n\nRead: What incarcerated rappers can teach America\n\nStill, direct action is never the primary component of a movement's longevity; it is only a piece that works in concert with a multitude of efforts. Movements frequently face setbacks and fierce resistance, and some even wait decades to capture the national imagination. \"When the cameras turn off, when there's not as much attention to the issues in mass media or social media, we think that the movement activity has somehow ended,\" Allen Kwabena Frimpong, a co-founder of the AdAstra Collective, an organization that supports and studies social movements, said in a recent interview . \"But it hasn't. It's that what is required of us has shifted ... in this phase of the cycle. It's a time to build strategy.\"\n\nWhen Black Lives Matter protests first captured the nation's attention and spread across American cities in the late summer of 2014, three high-profile police killings of Black people had occurred: John Crawford III in Ohio, Eric Garner in New York, and Michael Brown in Missouri. It was 18-year-old Brown's shooting death by an officer in Ferguson that marked a tipping point in the movement: The nation saw several weeks of uprisings and sustained protests demanding policing reform and accountability. That energy was sustained in Chicago, New York, Baton Rouge, Dallas, Minneapolis, Milwaukee, Oakland, St. Louis, and others until 2016.\n\nThe street protests subsided with the advent of Trump's presidency, but this did not mean that activism and organizing weren't happening behind the scenes. The networks created by those protests nurtured the infrastructure necessary to seed engagement today. The Movement for Black Lives released a policy platform in 2016 , pivoting toward increased influence in electoral politics, and advocating for economic justice, investment in education and health care, and reparations. And activists working in Ferguson launched Campaign Zero, a data-driven resource that drew attention to police-union contracts that make it impossible to discipline, investigate, or fire officers for repeated charges of misconduct. Organizers from these groups, along with those from the Black Lives Matter Global Network, have maintained a clarity of focus for years.\n\nRead: Don't fall for the chaos theory of the protests\n\nAnd it shows: In 2016, just 43 percent of Americans supported the Black Lives Matter movement. Four years later, the needle has moved significantly. A majority of Americans -and more than half of white people- support the protests as well as major reform in policing. Defunding police departments has been a long-held position by activists working toward outright abolition and the transformation of norms for enforcing public safety. In this moment, ideas that were once deemed too radical have meaningfully entered the mainstream discourse.\n\nPerhaps the closest analogue for this present American moment is 1965, in Selma, Alabama-where protests led to a swift federal legislative response. After years of grassroots efforts and organizing to challenge local voting laws that barred Black Americans from the ballot box, national civil-rights leaders from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee started to align their efforts with Alabama activists. But it was the death of Jimmie Lee Jackson -a veteran and church deacon who was shot by a state trooper during a nighttime march on February 18-that accelerated the push for federal intervention. That's when the idea to march 54 miles from Selma to Montgomery was born. (At one point, organizers considered carrying Jackson's casket to the steps of the capitol to lay at the feet of Governor George Wallace.)\n\nOn March 7, 1965, known as Bloody Sunday, the nation witnessed the totalitarian brutality of the American South on live TV when state troopers advanced on some 600 protesters attempting to cross the Edmund Pettus Bridge. Then-25-year-old John Lewis , the head of SNCC, was severely beaten and suffered a skull fracture; the troopers tear-gassed and battered other protesters on the bridge. From Atlanta, the head of the SCLC, Martin Luther King Jr., urged people from other states to come to Selma in solidarity, and by March 9, hundreds had answered the call. They attempted to cross the bridge again to march to Montgomery, but turned back to avoid another confrontation with the troopers. The strategy was employed to dramatize the unequal application of the law and to affirm the peaceful disobedience of this enterprise. Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., as protests in support of the Alabama campaign went on outside the White House, a small group of young people staged a sit-in for almost seven hours-first in a main-floor corridor and later in the East Wing-after surreptitiously gaining entry through one of the building's public guided tours.\n\nRead: John Lewis was an American Founder\n\nActivists, bolstered by the national attention to the crisis in Selma, saw the swift materialization of those efforts at the federal level. On March 15, addressing a joint session of Congress, President Lyndon Johnson introduced voting-rights legislation. \"Their cause must be our cause too,\" Johnson said. \"Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice.\" With the support of federal courts, activists and allies set out again for Montgomery, leaving Selma on March 21 and arriving at the capitol on March 25. That final Selma-to-Montgomery march, which culminated with 25,000 participants, was the embodiment of a victory soon to come: On August 6, Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law.\n\nThe civil-rights movement was ultimately successful, yet it was also beset by ruthless obstruction. Prior to 1965, Selma activists, along with SNCC, orchestrated voter-registration efforts and sit-ins to protest segregation, and were met with fierce resistance from state and local authorities in concert with the White Citizens' Council and the Ku Klux Klan. A 1964 court injunction forbidding gatherings of three or more people for the cause of civil rights also stymied momentum. It's clear that social movements are endemic to American life: The constant presence of protests and activism has shaped culture and policy over the past 60 years. Yet the anticipation of delays and deterrence by oppositional forces is built into movement work. Key players have to continuously adapt their strategies and challenge resistance by powerful actors to achieve any movement's goals.\n\nToday, the Black Lives Matter movement is a decentralized, leaderful , interdependent network of organizations and individuals, channeling its resources toward building a society where Black people can flourish. Friday's march and convention presented a myriad of committed activists working twin threads of direct-action protests and longer-term plans to dramatize the urgency of this crisis. Rooted in Black feminist thought, the convention demonstrated the capaciousness of this movement and highlighted efforts from large and small communities nationwide. Success for these activists and allies ranges from closing down a notorious jail to electing someone to Congress. As long as these efforts face a hostile Trump administration , though, the movement is likely to encounter many setbacks. Still, its holistic agenda-that all (cis/trans/queer/disabled) Black lives matter-is why the movement will last.\n\n\"Every Black person in the United States is gonna stand up,\" Jacob Blake Sr., the father of Jacob Blake, told the crowd at Friday's march . \"We're gonna hold court today. We're gonna hold court on systematic racism ... Guilty. Racism against all of us.\" Widespread multicity street protests in the name of Blake and others may once again claim nationwide consciousness. But the unseen, deliberative work of activism will persist whether the cameras are on or off."

      "text": "The New Reconstruction\n\nThe United States has its best opportunity in 150 years to belatedly fulfill its promise as a multiracial democracy.\n\nA fter George Floyd was killed, Donald Trump sensed an opportunity. Americans, anguished and angry over Floyd's death, had erupted in protest-some set fires, broke the windows of department stores, and stormed a police precinct. Commentators reached for historical analogies, circling in on 1968 and the twilight of the civil-rights era, when riots and rebellion engulfed one American city after another. Back then, Richard Nixon seized on a message of \"law and order.\" He would restore normalcy by suppressing protest with the iron hand of the state. In return for his promise of pacification, Americans gave him the White House.\n\nSurveying the protests, Trump saw a path to victory in Nixon's footsteps: The uprisings of 2020 could rescue him from his catastrophic mishandling of the coronavirus pandemic. The president leaned into his own \"law and order\" message. He lashed out against \"thugs\" and \"terrorists,\" warning that \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts.\" Ahead of what was to be his comeback rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in June, Trump tweeted, \"Any protesters, anarchists, agitators, looters or lowlifes who are going to Oklahoma please understand, you will not be treated like you have been in New York, Seattle, or Minneapolis\"-making no distinction between those protesting peacefully and those who might engage in violence.\n\nIn this, Trump was returning to a familiar playbook. He was relying on the chaos of the protests to produce the kind of racist backlash that he had ridden to the presidency in 2016. Trump had blamed the 2014 protests in Ferguson, Missouri-a response to the shooting of Michael Brown by a police officer-on Barack Obama's indulgence of criminality. \"With our weak leadership in Washington, you can expect Ferguson type riots and looting in other places,\" Trump predicted in 2014. As president, he saw such uprisings as deliverance.\n\nThen something happened that Trump did not foresee. It didn't work.\n\nTrump was elected president on a promise to restore an idealized past in which America's traditional aristocracy of race was unquestioned. But rather than restore that aristocracy, four years of catastrophe have-at least for the moment-discredited it. Instead of ushering in a golden age of prosperity and a return to the cultural conservatism of the 1950s, Trump's presidency has radicalized millions of white Americans who were previously inclined to dismiss systemic racism as a myth, the racial wealth gap as a product of Black cultural pathology, and discriminatory policing as a matter of a few bad apples.\n\nThose staples of the American racial discourse became hard to sustain this year, as the country was enveloped by overlapping national crises. The pandemic exposed the president. The nation needed an experienced policy maker; instead it saw a professional hustler, playing to the cameras and claiming that the virus would disappear. As statistics emerged showing that Americans of color disproportionately filled the ranks of essential workers, the unemployed, and the dead, the White House and its allies in the conservative media downplayed the danger of the virus, urging Americans to return to work and resurrect the Trump economy, no matter the cost.\n\nMeanwhile, the state's seeming indifference to an epidemic of racist killings continued unabated: On February 23, Ahmaud Arbery was fatally shot after being pursued by three men in Georgia who thought he looked suspicious; for months, the men walked free. On March 13, Breonna Taylor, an emergency-room technician, was killed by Louisville, Kentucky, police officers serving a no-knock warrant to find a cache of drugs that did not exist; months later, one of the officers was fired but no charges were filed. Then, on Memorial Day, the Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on Floyd's neck and ignored his many pleas for help. The nation erupted. According to some polls, more than 23 million people participated in anti-police-brutality protests, potentially making this the largest protest movement in American history.\n\nAmerican history has produced a few similar awakenings. In 1955, the images of a mutilated Emmett Till helped spark the civil-rights movement. In 2013, the acquittal of Trayvon Martin's killer inspired Alicia Garza to declare that Black lives matter, giving form to a movement dedicated to finishing the work begun by its predecessors. Just as today, the stories and images of shattered Black lives inspired Americans to make the promises of the Declaration of Independence more than just a fable of the founding. But almost as quickly, the dream of remaking society faltered, when white Americans realized what they would have to sacrifice to deliver freedom. The urgent question now is whether this time is different.\n\nFrom the September 2020 issue: Daniel Q. Gillion on the myth of the silent majority\n\nThe conditions in America today do not much resemble those of 1968. In fact, the best analogue to the current moment is the first and most consequential such awakening-in 1868. The story of that awakening offers a guide, and a warning. In the 1860s, the rise of a racist demagogue to the presidency, the valor of Black soldiers and workers, and the stories of outrages against the emancipated in the South stunned white northerners into writing the equality of man into the Constitution. The triumphs and failures of this anti-racist coalition led America to the present moment. It is now up to their successors to fulfill the promises of democracy, to make a more perfect union, to complete the work of Reconstruction.\n\nThey came for George Ruby in the middle of the night, as many as 50 of them, their faces blackened to conceal their identities. As the Confederate veterans dragged Ruby from his home, they mocked him for having believed that he would be safe in Jackson, Louisiana: \"S'pose you thought the United States government would protect you, did you?\" They dragged him at least a mile, to a creek, where they beat him with a paddle and left him, half-dressed and bleeding, with a warning: Leave, and never return.\n\nOne of the few Black agents of the Freedmen's Bureau, the federal agency established to facilitate the transition of the emancipated from slavery to freedom in the South, Ruby had come to Jackson in 1866 to open a school for the newly liberated. Although some of the men who attacked Ruby were eventually tried, under the guard of Black Union soldiers, Ruby heeded his attackers' warning. But his choice of destination-Texas-would make him a frequent witness to the same violence he fled.\n\n\"Texas was very violent during the early years of Reconstruction,\" Merline Pitre, a historian and biographer of Ruby, told me. One observer at the time said that \"there was so much violence in Texas that if he had to choose between hell and Texas, he would have chosen hell.\"\n\nRuby traveled through the state reviewing the work of the Freedmen's Bureau and sending dispatches to his superiors. As the historian Barry A. Crouch recounts in The Dance of Freedom , Ruby warned that the formerly enslaved were beset by the \"fiendish lawlessness of the whites who murder and outrage the free people with the same indifference as displayed in the killing of snakes or other venomous reptiles,\" and that \"terrorism engendered by the brutal and murderous acts of the inhabitants, mostly rebels,\" was preventing the freedmen from so much as building schools.\n\nThe post-Civil War years were a moment of great peril for the emancipated, but also great promise. A stubborn coterie of Republican Radicals-longtime abolitionists and their allies-were not content to have simply saved the Union. They wanted to transform it: to make a nation where \"all men are created equal\" did not just mean white men.\n\nBut the country was exhausted by the ravages of war. The last thing most white Americans wanted was to be dragged through a bitter conflict over expanding the boundaries of American citizenship. They wanted to rebuild the country and get back to business. John Wilkes Booth had been moved to assassinate Abraham Lincoln not by the Confederate collapse, but by the president's openness to extending the franchise to educated Black men and those who had fought for the Union, an affront Booth described as \"nigger citizenship.\"\n\nLincoln's successor, Andrew Johnson, viewed the Radical Republican project as an insult to the white men to whom the United States truly belonged. A Tennessee Democrat and self-styled champion of the white working class, the president believed that \"Negroes have shown less capacity for government than any other race of people,\" and that allowing the formerly enslaved to vote would eventually lead to \"such a tyranny as this continent has never yet witnessed.\" Encouraged by Johnson's words and actions, southern elites worked to reduce the emancipated to conditions that resembled slavery in all but name.\n\nThroughout the South, when freedmen signed contracts with their former masters, those contracts were broken; if they tried to seek work elsewhere, they were hunted down; if they reported their concerns to local authorities, they were told that the testimony of Black people held no weight in court. When they tried to purchase land, they were denied; when they tried to borrow capital to establish businesses, they were rejected; when they demanded decent wages, they were met with violence.\n\nIn the midst of these terrors and denials, the emancipated organized as laborers, protesters, and voters, forming the Union Leagues and other Republican clubs that would become the basis of their political power. Southern whites insisted that the freedmen were unfit for the ballot, even as they witnessed their sophistication in protest and organization. In fact, what the former slave masters feared was not that Black people were incapable of self-government, but the world the emancipated might create.\n\nFrom 1868 to 1871, Black people in the South faced a \"wave of counter-revolutionary terror,\" the historian Eric Foner has written, one that \"lacks a counterpart either in the American experience or in that of the other Western Hemisphere societies that abolished slavery in the nineteenth century.\" Texas courts, according to Foner, \"indicted some 500 white men for the murder of blacks in 1865 and 1866, but not one was convicted.\" He cites one northern observer who commented, \"Murder is considered one of their inalienable state rights.\"\n\nThe system that emerged across the South was so racist and authoritarian that one Freedmen's Bureau agent wrote that the emancipated \"would be just as well off with no law at all or no Government.\" Indeed, the police were often at the forefront of the violence. In 1866, in New Orleans, police joined an attack on Republicans organizing to amend the state constitution ; dozens of the mostly Black delegates were killed. General Philip Sheridan wrote in a letter to Ulysses S. Grant that the incident \"was an absolute massacre by the police ... perpetrated without the shadow of a necessity.\" The same year, in Memphis, white police officers started a fight with several Black Union veterans, then used the conflict as a justification to begin firing at Black people-civilians and soldiers alike-all over the city. The killing went on for days.\n\nAdam Serwer: Trump gave police permission to be brutal\n\nThese stories began to reach the North in bureaucratic dispatches like Ruby's, in newspaper accounts, and in testimony to the congressional committee on Reconstruction. Northerners heard about Lucy Grimes of Texas, whose former owner demanded that she beat her own son, then had Grimes beaten to death when she refused. Her killers went unpunished because the court would not hear \"negro testimony.\" Northerners also heard about Madison Newby, a former Union scout from Virginia driven by \"rebel people\" from land he had purchased, who testified that former slave masters were \"taking the colored people and tying them up by the thumbs if they do not agree to work for six dollars a month.\" And they heard about Glasgow William, a Union veteran in Kentucky who was lynched in front of his wife by the Ku Klux Klan for declaring his intent to vote for \"his old commander.\" (Newspapers sympathetic to the white South dismissed such stories; one called the KKK the \"phantom of diseased imaginations.\")\n\nThe South's intransigence in defeat, and its campaign of terror against the emancipated, was so heinous that even those inclined toward moderation began to reconsider. Carl Schurz, a German immigrant and Union general, was dispatched by the Johnson administration to investigate conditions in the South. Schurz sympathized with white southerners who struggled to adjust to the new order. \"It should not have surprised any fair-minded person that many Southern people should, for a time, have clung to the accustomed idea that the landowner must also own the black man tilling his land, and that any assertion of freedom of action on the part of that black man was insubordination equivalent to criminal revolt, and any dissent by the black man from the employer's opinion or taste, intolerable insolence,\" he wrote.\n\nThe horrors he witnessed, however, convinced him that the federal government had to intervene: \"I saw in various hospitals negroes, women as well as men, whose ears had been cut off or whose bodies were slashed with knives or bruised with whips, or bludgeons, or punctured with shot wounds. Dead negroes were found in considerable number in the country roads or on the fields, shot to death, or strung upon the limbs of trees. In many districts the colored people were in a panic of fright, and the whites in a state of almost insane irritation against them.\"\n\nWhen Schurz returned to Washington, Johnson refused to hear his findings. The president had already set his mind to maintaining the United States as a white man's government. He told Schurz that a report was unnecessary, then silently waited for Schurz to leave. \"President Johnson evidently wished to suppress my testimony as to the condition of things in the South,\" Schurz wrote in his memoir. \"I resolved not to let him do so.\"\n\nThe stories of southern violence radicalized the white North. \"The impression made by these things upon the minds of the Northern people can easily be imagined,\" Schurz wrote. \"This popular temper could not fail to exercise influence upon Congress and stimulate radical tendencies among its members.\"\n\nStill convinced that most of the country was on his side, Johnson sank into paranoia, grandeur, and self-pity. In his \"Swing Around the Circle\" tour, Johnson gave angry speeches before raucous crowds, comparing himself to Lincoln, calling for some Radical Republicans to be hanged as traitors, and blaming the New Orleans riot on those who had called for Black suffrage in the first place, saying, \"Every drop of blood that was shed is upon their skirts and they are responsible.\" He blocked the measures that Congress took up to protect the rights of the emancipated, describing them as racist against white people. He told Black leaders that he was their \"Moses,\" even as he denied their aspirations to full citizenship.\n\nJohnson had reason to believe, in a country that had only just abolished slavery, that the Radicals' attempt to create a multiracial democracy would be rejected by the electorate. What he did not expect was that in his incompetence, coarseness, and vanity, he would end up discrediting his own racist crusade, and press the North into pursuing a program of racial justice that it had wanted to avoid.\n\nBlack leaders were conscious that Johnson's racism had, rather than weakening the cause of Black suffrage, reaffirmed its necessity. The Christian Recorder , edited by the Reverend James Lynch, editorialized that \"paradoxical as it may seem, President Johnson's opposition to our political interests will finally result in securing them to us.\" The Republicans swept the 1866 midterms, and Johnson was impeached in 1868-officially for violating the Tenure of Office Act, but this was mere pretext. The real reason was his obstruction of Congress's efforts to protect the emancipated. Johnson was acquitted, but his presidency never recovered.\n\nThe turmoil in the South, and Johnson's enabling of it, set Congress on the path to the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments, ratified in 1868 and 1870, respectively. The amendments made everyone born or naturalized in the United States a citizen and made it unconstitutional to deprive Americans of the right to vote on the basis of race. Today, the principles underlying the Reconstruction amendments are largely taken for granted; few in the political mainstream openly oppose them, even as they might seek to undermine them. But these amendments are the foundation of true democracy in America, the north star for every American liberation movement that has followed.\n\nCongress also passed laws barring racial discrimination in public accommodations, which would be quickly ignored and then, almost a century later, revived by the civil-rights movement. State governments, though not without their flaws and struggles, massively expanded public education for Black and white southerners, funded public services, and built infrastructure. On the ashes of the planter oligarchy, the freedmen and their allies sought to build a new kind of democracy, one worthy of the name.\n\nThe Reconstruction agenda was not motivated by pure idealism. The Republican Party understood that without Black votes, it was not viable in the South, and that its opposition would return to Congress stronger than it was before the war if Black disenfranchisement succeeded. Still, a combination of partisan self-interest and egalitarian idealism established the conditions for multiracial democracy in the United States.\n\nSwept up in the infinite possibilities of the moment, even the abolitionist Frederick Douglass, who before the war had excoriated America for the hollowness of its ideals, dared to imagine the nation as more than a white man's republic with Black men as honored guests. \"I want a home here not only for the Negro, the mulatto, and the Latin races; but I want the Asiatic to find a home here in the United States, and feel at home here, both for his sake and for ours,\" Douglass declared in 1869. \"In whatever else other nations may have been great and grand, our greatness and grandeur will be found in the faithful application of the principle of perfect civil equality to the people of all races and of all creeds, and to men of no creeds.\"\n\nBlack Americans today do not face the same wave of terror they did in the 1860s. Still, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Ahmaud Arbery were only the most recent names Americans learned. There was Eric Garner, who was choked to death on a New York City sidewalk during an arrest as he rasped, \"I can't breathe.\" There was Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina, who was shot in the back while fleeing an officer. There was Laquan McDonald in Chicago, who was shot 16 times by an officer who kept firing even as McDonald lay motionless on the ground. There was Stephon Clark, who was gunned down while using a cellphone in his grandmother's backyard in Sacramento, California. There was Natasha McKenna, who died after being tased in a Virginia prison. There was Freddie Gray, who was seen being loaded into the back of a Baltimore police van in which his spinal cord was severed. There was Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old in Cleveland with a toy gun who was killed by police within moments of their arrival.\n\nWhat these stories have in common is that they were all captured on video. Just as southern dispatches and congressional testimony about the outrages against the emancipated radicalized the white North with a recognition of how the horrors of racism shaped Black life in America, the proliferation of videos from cellphones and body cameras has provided a vivid picture of the casual and often fatal abuse of Black Americans by police.\n\n\"There's a large swath of white people who I think thought Black people were being hyperbolic about police humiliation and harassment,\" Patrisse Cullors, one of the co-founders of the Black Lives Matter movement, told me. \"We started seeing more and more people share videos of white people calling the cops on Black people and using the cops as their weapon against the Black community. Those kinds of viral videos-that weren't just about Black death, but Black people's everyday experience with policing-have shaped a new ideology. What are the police really here for? Who are they truly protecting?\"\n\nThe continual accretion of gruesome evidence of police violence has taken a toll on today's activists; some rarely watch the videos anymore. George Floyd was killed just a few blocks from the home of Miski Noor, an organizer in Minneapolis. But Noor could watch the video of his death for only a minute before turning away.\n\n\"I've seen enough,\" Noor told me. \"I don't want to see any more.\" But the work of Cullors, Noor, and others ensured that these videos dramatically shifted public opinion about racism and American policing.\n\nAfter the rise of Barack Obama, large numbers of white Americans became convinced not only that racism was a thing of the past but also that, to the extent racial prejudice remained a factor in American life, white people were its primary victims. \"In 2008, in the battleground states, more white voters thought reverse discrimination was a bigger deal than classic racial discrimination,\" Cornell Belcher, a pollster who worked on both of Barack Obama's presidential campaigns, told me. The activism of Black Lives Matter, the Movement for Black Lives, and other groups, as well as the unceasing testimony of those lost to police violence, has reversed that trend. \"In the past, white voters by and large didn't think that discrimination was a real big thing. Now they understand that it is.\"\n\nA June 2020 Monmouth University poll found increases across all races in the belief that law enforcement discriminates against Black people in the U.S. The same poll found that 76 percent of Americans considered racism and discrimination a \"big problem\"-up from 51 percent in 2015. In a Pew Research Center poll the same month, fully 67 percent of Americans expressed some degree of support for Black Lives Matter.\n\nThese numbers are even more remarkable when considered in historical context. In 1964, in a poll taken nine months after the March on Washington, where Martin Luther King Jr. gave his \"I Have a Dream\" speech, 74 percent of Americans said such mass demonstrations were more likely to harm than to help the movement for racial equality. In 1965, after marchers in Selma, Alabama, were beaten by state troopers, less than half of Americans said they supported the marchers.\n\nThe shift that's occurred this time around \"wasn't by happenstance,\" Brittany Packnett Cunningham, an activist and a writer, told me, nor is it only the product of video evidence. \"It has been the work of generations of Black activists, Black thinkers, and Black scholars that has gotten us here\"-people like Angela Davis, Kimberlé Crenshaw, Michelle Alexander, and others. \"Six years ago, people were not using the phrase systemic racism beyond activist circles and academic circles. And now we are in a place where it is readily on people's lips, where folks from CEOs to grandmothers up the street are talking about it, reading about it, researching on it, listening to conversations about it.\"\n\nAll of that preparation met the moment: George Floyd's killing, the pandemic's unmistakable toll on Black Americans, and Trump's callous and cynical response to both.\n\nStill, like Andrew Johnson, Trump bet his political fortunes on his assumption that the majority of white Americans shared his fears and beliefs about Black Americans. Like Johnson, Trump did not anticipate how his own behavior, and the behavior he enabled and encouraged, would discredit the cause he backed. He did not anticipate that the activists might succeed in convincing so many white Americans to see the protests as righteous and justified, that so many white Americans would understand police violence as an extension of his own cruelty, that the pandemic would open their eyes to deep-seated racial inequities.\n\n\"I think this country is at a turning point and has been for a little while. We went from celebrating the election of the first Black president in history to bemoaning a white nationalist in the White House,\" Alicia Garza told me. \"People are grappling with the fact that we're not actually in a post-racial society.\"\n\nHow far will the possibilities of this moment extend? We could consider two potential outcomes-one focused on police and prisons, and a broader one, aimed at eliminating the deeply entrenched systems that keep Black people from realizing full equality, a long-standing crisis Americans have tried to suppress with policing and prisons rather than attempting to resolve it.\n\nA majority of Americans have accepted the diagnosis of Black Lives Matter activists, even if they have yet to embrace their more radical remedies, such as defunding the police. For the moment, the surge in public support for Black Lives Matter appears to be an expression of approval for the movement's most basic demand: that the police stop killing Black people. This request is so reasonable that only those committed to white supremacy regard it as outrageous. Large majorities of Americans support reforms such as requiring the use of body cameras, banning choke holds, mandating a national police-misconduct database, and curtailing qualified immunity, which shields officers from liability for violating people's constitutional rights.\n\nThe urgency of addressing this crisis has been underscored by the ongoing behavior of police departments, whose officers have reacted much as the white South did after Appomattox: by brutalizing the people demanding change.\n\nIn New York City, officers drove two SUVs into a crowd of protesters. In Philadelphia, cops beat demonstrators with batons. In Louisville, police shot pepper balls at reporters. In Austin, Texas, police left a protester with a fractured skull and brain damage after firing beanbag rounds unprovoked. In Buffalo, New York, an elderly protester was shoved to the ground by police in full riot gear, sustained brain damage, and had to be hospitalized. The entire riot team resigned from the unit in protest-not because of their colleagues' behavior, but because they faced sanction for it.\n\nYet the more the police sought to violently repress the protesters, the more people spilled into the streets in defiance, risking a solitary death in a hospital bed in order to assert their right to exist, to not have their lives stolen by armed agents of the state. \"As the uprising went on, we saw the police really responding in ways that were retaliatory and vicious,\" Noor told me. \"Kind of like, 'How dare you question me and my intentions and my power?' \"\n\nAt the height of Reconstruction, racist horrors produced the political will to embrace measures once considered impossibly idealistic, such as Black male suffrage. Many Black Lives Matter activists have a similarly radical vision. The calls to defund or abolish the police seem sudden to those who do not share their premises. But these activists see a line of continuity in American policing that stretches back to the New Orleans and Memphis killings that so outraged the postbellum white North, and back further still, to antebellum slave patrols. And although there is no firm consensus on how to put an end to this history, there is broad agreement that police should not be the solution to problems like poverty, addiction, and homelessness, and that public resources should be used to meet the needs of communities.\n\nIn the face of implacable violence across generations, simply banning choke holds and mandating body cameras are not meaningful solutions. To these activists, centuries of liberal attempts at reform have only bureaucratized the role of the police as the armed guardians of a racist system, one that fractures Black families, restricts Black people's employment opportunities, and excludes them from the ballot box.\n\n\"I want to see the existing systems of policing and carceral punishment abolished and replaced with things that actually restore justice and keep people safe at home,\" Packnett Cunningham told me.\n\nThe problem is not simply that a chance encounter with police can lead to injury or death-but that once marked by the criminal-justice system, Black people can be legally disenfranchised, denied public benefits, and discriminated against in employment, housing, and jury service. \"People who have been convicted of felonies almost never truly reenter the society they inhabited prior to their conviction. Instead, they enter a separate society, a world hidden from public view, governed by a set of oppressive and discriminatory rules and laws that do not apply to everyone else,\" Michelle Alexander wrote in The New Jim Crow in 2010. \"Because this new system is not explicitly based on race, it is easier to defend on seemingly neutral grounds.\"\n\nIn the aftermath of the Ferguson protests, it was fashionable to speak of a \"new civil-rights movement.\" But it is perhaps more illuminating to see Black Lives Matter as a new banner raised on the same field of battle, stained by the blood of generations who came before. The fighters are new, but the conflict is the same one that Frederick Douglass and George Ruby fought, one that goes far beyond policing.\n\nAs Garza put it to me, American society has turned to law enforcement to address the challenges Black communities face, but those challenges can't be solved with a badge and a gun. \"You don't have schools that function well; you don't have teachers that get paid; you don't have hospitals in some communities,\" she said. \"You don't have grocery stores in some communities. This creates the kinds of conditions that make people feel like police are necessary, but the solution is to actually reinvest in those things that give people a way to live a good life, where you have food, a roof over your head, where you can learn a craft or skill or just learn, period.\"\n\nBelieving in racial equality in the abstract and supporting policies that would make it a reality are two different things. Most white Americans have long professed the former, and pointedly declined to do the latter. This paradox has shown up so many times in American history that social scientists have a name for it: the principle-implementation gap. This gap is what ultimately doomed the Reconstruction project.\n\nOne of the ways the principle-implementation gap manifests itself is in the distinction between civic equality and economic justice. After the Civil War, Representative Thaddeus Stevens, a Radical Republican, urged the federal government to seize the estates of wealthy former Confederates and use them in part to provide freedmen with some small compensation for centuries of forced labor. Stevens warned that without economic empowerment, freedmen would eventually find themselves at the mercy of their former masters.\n\n\"It is impossible that any practical equality of rights can exist where a few thousand men monopolize the whole landed property,\" Stevens wrote in 1865. \"The whole fabric of Southern society must be changed, and never can it be done if this opportunity is lost. Without this, this government can never be, as it never has been, a true republic.\"\n\nEven in his own party, Stevens's idea was viewed as extreme. Nineteenth-century Republicans believed in an ideology of \"free labor,\" in which the interests of labor and capital were the same, and all workers could elevate themselves into a life of plenty through diligence and entrepreneurship. By arming Black men with the ballot, most Republicans believed they had set the stage for a free-labor society. They did not see what the emancipated saw: a world of state-sanctioned and informal coercion in which simply elevating oneself through hard work was impossible.\n\nAs the freedmen sought to secure their rights through state intervention-nondiscrimination laws in business and education, government jobs, and federal protection of voting rights-many Republicans recoiled. As the historian Heather Cox Richardson has written, these white Republicans began to see freedmen not as ideal free-laborers but as a corrupt labor interest, committed to securing through government largesse what they could not earn through hard work. \"When the majority of the Southern African-Americans could not overcome the overwhelming obstacles in their path to economic security,\" she wrote in The Death of Reconstruction , \"Northerners saw their failure as a rejection of free-labor ideals, accused them of being deficient workers, and willingly read them out of American society.\"\n\nRetreating from Reconstruction, these Republicans cast their objections to the project as advocacy for honest, limited government, rather than racism. But the results would ultimately be the same: an abandonment of the freedmen to their fate. Men like Carl Schurz, who had been briefly radicalized by the violence in the South and the extremism of Andrew Johnson, began to see federal intervention on behalf of the freedmen as its own kind of tyranny.\n\n\"Schurz advocated political amnesty, an end to federal intervention, and a return to 'local self-government' by men of 'property and enterprise,' \" Eric Foner writes. \"Schurz sincerely believed blacks' rights would be more secure under such governments than under the Reconstruction regimes. But whether he quite appreciated it or not, his program had no other meaning than a return to white supremacy.\"\n\nLocal authority was ultimately restored by force of arms, as Democrats and their paramilitary allies overthrew the Reconstruction governments through intimidation, murder, and terrorism, and used their restored power to disenfranchise the emancipated for almost a century. Many of the devices the southern states used to do so-poll taxes, literacy tests-disenfranchised poor whites as well. (It was not the first or last time that the white elite would see the white poor as acceptable collateral damage in the fight for white supremacy.) At the national level, the economic collapse brought on by the Panic of 1873 wounded Republicans at the ballot box and further weakened support for the faltering Reconstruction project.\n\nWhite northerners deserted the cause as if they had never supported it. They understood that they were abandoning the emancipated to despotism, but most no longer considered the inalienable rights of Black Americans their problem.\n\n\"For a brief period-for the seven mystic years that stretched between Johnson's 'Swing Around the Circle' to the Panic of 1873, the majority of thinking Americans of the North believed in the equal manhood of Negroes,\" W. E. B. Du Bois wrote in 1935. \"While after long years the American world recovered in most matters, it has never yet quite understood why it could ever have thought that black men were altogether human.\" These Americans believed Black lives mattered. But only for a moment.\n\nThaddeus Stevens knew that without sufficient economic power, civic equality becomes difficult to maintain. His insight has proved remarkably durable across American history. The question now is whether a new coalition, radicalized by racism, can defy that history.\n\nThe most dramatic advances for Black Americans since Stevens's time have come in the form of civic equality, not economic justice. In 1932, Franklin D. Roosevelt broke the party of Lincoln's hold on northern Black voters with promises of a New Deal. But FDR's reliance on southerners in Congress-the guardians of American apartheid-ensured that most Black Americans were discriminated against by the policies that built the prosperous white middle class of the mid-20th century: the Social Security Act, the National Housing Act, the GI Bill, and others.\n\nWhen President John F. Kennedy introduced, in June 1963, what would become the Civil Rights Act, he saw it as fulfilling the work of Reconstruction. \"One hundred years of delay have passed since President Lincoln freed the slaves, yet their heirs, their grandsons, are not fully free. They are not yet freed from the bonds of injustice. They are not yet freed from social and economic oppression,\" Kennedy declared. \"And this nation, for all its hopes and all its boasts, will not be fully free until all its citizens are free.\"\n\nJFK's successor, Lyndon B. Johnson, sought to enact his vision with the passage of the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, and the Fair Housing Act, in what is sometimes referred to as the Second Reconstruction. But just as the first Reconstruction had been obliterated by Jim Crow, the Great Society's ambitions toward civic equality and economic justice were drowned by its crime-prevention programs. As the historian Elizabeth Hinton writes in From the War on Poverty to the War on Crime , those programs metastasized into a bipartisan policy of mass incarceration. Future administrations from both parties divested from the Great Society's social programs, while pouring funding into law enforcement. This, Hinton observes, left \"law enforcement agencies, criminal justice institutions, and jails as the primary public programs in many low-income communities across the United States.\"\n\nAmericans remember the occasion of Martin Luther King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech as the March on Washington, but this is a shorthand: The 1963 event was actually called the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. King and others in the civil-rights movement did not see the goals of civic equality and economic justice as severable. Yet they, too, struggled to persuade white Americans to devote the necessary public resources to resolving the yawning economic disparities between Black people and white people.\n\n\"White America, caught between the Negro upsurge and its own conscience, evolved a limited policy toward Negro freedom. It could not live with the intolerable brutality and bruising humiliation imposed upon the Negro by the society it cherished as democratic,\" King wrote in The Nation in 1966. \"A hardening of opposition to the satisfaction of Negro needs must be anticipated as the movement presses against financial privilege.\"\n\nKing was right. The racial wealth gap remains as wide today as it was in 1968, when the Fair Housing Act was passed. The median net worth of the American family is about $100,000. But the median net worth of white families is more than $170,000-while that of Black families is less than $20,000. According to William Darity Jr., an economist and Duke public-policy professor, fully a quarter of white families have a net worth of more than $1 million, while only 4 percent of Black families meet that threshold. These disparities in wealth persist among middle- and low-income families. In 2016, according to Pew, \"lower-income white households had a net worth of $22,900, compared with only $5,000 for Black households and $7,900 for Hispanic households in this income tier.\" These disparities are not the product of hard work or cultural differences, as one conservative line of thinking would have it. They are the product of public policy, what Darity calls the \"cumulative damages\" of racial discrimination across generations.\n\nWhat economic strides Black Americans had made in the decades since 1968-largely through homeownership, the traditional cornerstone of wealth-building in the United States-were all but wiped out by the Great Recession of 2008. From 2005 to 2009, according to the Pew Research Center, the median net worth of Black households dropped by 53 percent, while white household net worth dropped by 16 percent.\n\nJust as the Great Recession devastated the personal wealth of Black Americans, the coronavirus recession now threatens to destroy Black businesses, which are especially vulnerable to economic downturns, as they tend to lack corporate structures, easy access to credit, and large cash reserves. They are also less likely to be able to access government aid, because they may not have a preexisting relationship with the big banks that distribute the loans and because of outright discrimination. The National Community Reinvestment Coalition conducted an experiment in which white and Black subjects requested information about loans to help keep their small businesses open during the pandemic. It found that white requesters received favorable treatment-were offered more loan products, and were more likely to be encouraged to apply for them-compared with Black requesters.\n\nFrom February to April, according to Robert Fairlie, an economist at UC Santa Cruz, 41 percent of Black businesses stopped operations, compared with 22 percent of businesses overall. This loss will have a cascading effect, devastating not only the business owners themselves but the people who live in the cities and neighborhoods where they are located. \"Black-owned businesses tend to hire a disproportionate number of Black employees,\" Fairlie told me.\n\nIn the aftermath of the coronavirus, the nation will have to be reconstructed. It will require a massive federal effort to keep Americans in their homes, provide them with employment, revive businesses that have not been able to function under pandemic conditions, protect workers' health and safety, sustain cash-strapped state governments, and ultimately restore American prosperity. It will take an even greater effort to do so in a manner that does not simply reproduce existing inequities. But the necessity of post-pandemic rebuilding also provides an opportunity for a truly sweeping New Reconstruction, one that could endeavor to resolve the unfinished work of the nation's past Reconstructions.\n\nThe obstacles facing such an effort are manifold. Too many Americans still view racism as largely a personal failing rather than a systemic force. In this view, one's soul can be purged of racism by wielding the correct jargon, denouncing the right villains, and posting heartfelt Instagram captions. Fulfilling the potential of the current moment will require white Americans to do more than just seek or advertise their personal salvation.\n\nThen there is the question of whether the political vehicle of today's anti-racist coalition, the Democratic Party, is up to the task, should it prevail in the 2020 elections. Reversing the erosion of voting rights is an area of obvious partisan self-interest for Democrats, and one likely to command broad support. The fight against racist policing and mass incarceration is largely a state and local one. Activists have yet to persuade a majority of voters to embrace their most radical proposals, but they have already achieved a great deal of success in stiffening the spines of politicians in their dealings with police unions, in electing progressive district attorneys over the objections of those unions and their allies, and in prompting officials to transfer certain law-enforcement responsibilities to other public servants. The greater challenge will be enacting the kind of sweeping reforms that would unwind what King called entrenched financial privilege.\n\n\"Efforts to remedy glaring racial inequality in the criminal-justice system, which whites have long denied but now acknowledge, tap into principles of equal treatment that have historically been easier to get whites on board for than the big structural changes that are needed to produce some semblance of actual equality,\" the political scientist Michael Tesler told me recently. \"Whites have historically had little appetite for implementing the policies needed to achieve equality of outcomes.\"\n\nAs for the Democrats' presidential standard-bearer, Joe Biden has struck an ambitious note, invoking the legacy of Reconstructions past. \"The history of this nation teaches us that in some of our darkest moments of despair, we've made some of our greatest progress,\" Biden declared amid the Floyd protests in June. \"The Thirteenth, Fourteenth, Fifteenth Amendments followed the Civil War. The greatest economic growth in world history grew out of the Great Depression. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Voting Rights Act of '65 came on the tracks of Bull Connor's vicious dogs ... But it's going to take more than talk. We had talk before; we had protest before. We've got to now vow to make this at least an era of action and reverse the systemic racism with long-overdue concrete changes.\"\n\nSuch a call to action would be more promising if Biden himself were not an author of the system he now opposes. He became a U.S. senator in an era of racial backlash. He worked with segregationists to dismantle school-desegregation programs and was part of the bipartisan bloc that expanded mass incarceration. During the \"tough on crime\" era of the 1990s, he bragged on the Senate floor of the fondness for prisons and harsh punishment in the \"liberal wing of the Democratic Party.\" Biden's selection of Kamala Harris as his running mate is historic, but Harris, a former prosecutor, is no radical on these matters.\n\nYet change is possible, even for an old hand like Biden. Ulysses S. Grant married into a slave-owning family, and inherited an enslaved person from his father-in-law. Little in his past suggested that he would crush the slave empire of the Confederacy, smash the first Ku Klux Klan, and become the first American president to champion the full citizenship of Black men. Before he signed the Civil and Voting Rights Acts as president, Senator Lyndon Johnson was a reliable segregationist. History has seen more dramatic reversals than Joe Biden becoming a committed foe of systemic racism, though not many.\n\nIf Democrats seize the moment, it will be because the determination of a new generation of activists, and the uniqueness of the party's current makeup, has compelled them to do so. In the 1870s-and up through the 1960s-the American population was close to 90 percent white. Today it is 76 percent white. The growing diversity of the United States-and the Republican Party's embrace of white identity politics in response-has created a large constituency in the Democratic Party with a direct stake in the achievement of racial equality.\n\nThere has never been an anti-racist majority in American history; there may be one today in the racially and socioeconomically diverse coalition of voters radicalized by the abrupt transition from the hope of the Obama era to the cruelty of the Trump age. All political coalitions are eventually torn apart by their contradictions, but America has never seen a coalition quite like this.\n\nHistory teaches that awakenings such as this one are rare. If a new president, and a new Congress, do not act before the American people's demand for justice gives way to complacency or is eclipsed by backlash, the next opportunity will be long in coming. But in these moments, great strides toward the unfulfilled promises of the founding are possible. It would be unexpected if a demagogue wielding the power of the presidency in the name of white man's government inspired Americans to recommit to defending the inalienable rights of their countrymen. But it would not be the first time.\n\nThis article appears in the October 2020 print edition with the headline \"The Next Reconstruction.\"\n\n* Lead image: Illustration by Arsh Raziuddin; photographs by Alex Lau; Earl Gibson III; Francine Orr / Los Angeles Times ; Getty; Joe Raedle; Library of Congress; niAID; Zaid Patel"

      "text": "Anger Can Build a Better World\n\nBlack Lives Matter protests are not anti-American, but as American as one can get.\n\nR acism is alive in our society. It lives in store aisles, discriminatory 911 calls, policing, the racial wealth gap, and asymmetrical government responses to communities afflicted by COVID-19. Through protest, diverse voices are boldly standing up to racial injustice. And they are expressing anger while doing it. This rage is not a distraction, nor is it destructive to American ideals. It is playing a crucial role, politically and morally, in helping us build a better country.\n\nThe purpose of rage is not to make white people feel guilty. Rather, it communicates the value of Black lives and egalitarian principles. Anger, in this way, is not antithetical to love. It expresses compassion for the downtrodden and the desire for a better world. Anger at racial injustice makes people eager to do something about it. We cannot suppress anger, nor should we dress it up in the garments of respectability politics.\n\nThe anger we are witnessing at Black Lives Matter protests is more than emotional identity politics. Protesters' anger signals that Black folks have moral worth and should be respected. It says that while the system may not hold Black people in high regard, those risking psychological discomfort, infection, and arrest do. This anger dignifies Black children who might have begun to think that their skin tone was a death sentence. It proclaims that Black lives do, in fact, matter.\n\nRead: Is this the beginning of the end of American racism?\n\nAnger further expresses how much the protesters treasure justice. In June, the author and activist Kimberly Jones argued for the necessity and power of Black Lives Matter protests, saying the nation is \"lucky that what Black people are looking for is equality and not revenge.\" It is easy to see this statement as a threat. But Jones is underscoring that Black people's anger asserts the values we all claim to hold dear in a liberal democracy. Black people and their allies are simply striving, through their anger, to advertise these shared values of equality and the necessity of putting them into practice.\n\nOutraged protesters uphold principles no different from those articulated in the founding documents. They just want them applied universally across the population. This makes their anger not anti-American, but as American as one can get. Anger not only demands that things change; it proclaims that change matters. And when change is absent, anger reminds us of its need to exist.\n\nA s the Black feminist poet Audre Lorde stated, focused anger \"can become a powerful source of energy serving progress.\" Similarly, in her 2018 book, Good and Mad: The Revolutionary Power of Women's Anger , columnist Rebecca Traister points to a range of women, including the abolitionist Maria Stewart and the activist Emma González, whose work for social change was sparked by righteous anger. In these instances and in today's movement for racial justice, anger drives the conviction that a better future is possible.\n\nAdam Serwer: 'Protest is the highest form of patriotism'\n\nEmotions tend to be accompanied by urges to act in some way. Fear, for example, motivates us to run away. Anger, however, motivates us to run toward a target. It makes us eager to approach and tackle the issue head-on. Perhaps without their anger, activists protesting police violence in Portland, Oregon, would have stayed home as soon as federal troops arrived. But they didn't retreat, no matter how powerful or threatening the militarized resistance was. They persisted on behalf of Black lives.\n\nAnger motivates us to fight against injustice and for those at the margins. In Portland, anger fuels the protesters' willingness to stare injustice in the face. Rather than discounting their anger, we must hear the love and compassion they are expressing with it. By consistently showing up, building walls of protection, facing tear gas, and getting arrested, they are communicating concern, care, and respect for Black people.\n\nWhen faced with something as persistent and destructive as racism, we might think that things will never change and that we cannot change them. But anger can make people optimistic about the future and increase their self-belief. A 2014 study found that angry people think they are going to prevail no matter the circumstances. Anger makes them believe that they are powerful and capable. This effect, in turn, makes angry people less risk-averse, which is evidenced in how protesters from around the world are fighting for change at the risk of police violence and illness.\n\nDeirdre Mask: The Black Lives Matter movement is being written into the streetscape\n\nWhen I originally saw the footage of George Floyd's death, my heart was broken, not only because a Black man was dying before my eyes, but because I had seen so many of these videos before. So many cries like Floyd's have been ignored. But my anger refused to allow me to despair. As much as anger is a response to past events, it is also forward-looking. Anger makes us believe that we can shape a new, more just world. It is a source of hope, one that propels the struggle against seemingly insurmountable obstacles.\n\nFor those skeptical of anger's power and usefulness, it is important to note that anger at racial injustice does not cause poverty, inadequate housing, a police state, or dehumanizing practices. Anger responds to these atrocities. Many refuse to believe this, because to them, anger is always irrational, undemocratic, and synonymous with violence . So they fear it. However, anger is a legitimate response to wrongdoing. It challenges us to achieve political equality. And we can have anger without violence, and violence without anger.\n\nStill, some people might prefer to remain afraid of rage, the racial bodies who express it, and the change it has the potential to bring about. But they should know that fearing anger will teach them nothing. Listening to it, seeking to understand it, and allowing oneself to be challenged by it will.\n\nTo those who continue to embrace and express anger, despite insincere attempts by others to control it, thank you for responding to racism with rage. This matters, particularly when so many find comfort in rationalizing, ignoring, or wishing away racism. Your fury is needed to awaken our consciousness, and to create a more perfect union."

      "text": "Becoming a Parent in the Age of Black Lives Matter\n\nWhen the Movement for Black Lives began, I did not have children. Now the fight means more to me-coupled with fears that are even deeper.\n\nThis article was featured in One Story to Read Today, a newsletter in which our editors recommend a single must-read from The Atlantic , Monday through Friday. Sign up for it here.\n\nIn a park about half a mile from my home is a wide-open field of grass, whose thin, uneven blades rise up past my ankles. The playground near the park is, like other playgrounds across the country, no longer open, surrounded by the orange-plastic fencing that has become unsettlingly familiar. Swings and seesaws and monkey bars that were once teeming with children sit in silence. Robins have begun making a nest at the top of the slide, building a home in the empty corner of the jungle gym's small deck.\n\nI have a 3-year-old son who loves to sing songs from The Lion King at the top of his lungs and a 1-year-old daughter who laughs like there are fireworks in her belly. Almost every day over the past three months of quarantine, I have taken my children to this field as the culmination of our daily walks. We are almost always the only people there, and relish the sweeping emptiness that surrounds us. We park the double stroller in the center of the grass and build our own world around it. We grab sticks from fallen branches and pretend to be wizards casting spells that turn one another into farm animals. We play tag and chase one another through the field as the tall grass licks our ankles. We bend down low to the earth, take deep breaths, and blow the dandelion-seed heads, watching their small, white parachute seeds spiral through the wind.\n\nMy children are both respite from all the tragedy transpiring in the world, and a reminder of how high the stakes are. When I am with them-on our walks, playing in the field, reading them stories, giving them baths-I am not able to fall into the infinite hole of endless scrolling that so often brings me to despair. But also when I am with them, I am reminded of the brokenness of the world that their mother and I have brought them into, and get lost in a labyrinth of anxiety about how I might protect them from it.\n\nI did not have children when the Movement for Black Lives was at its height. At protests following police killings six years ago, I moved through the night with brazen indifference about what might happen to me. I was governed by anger and thought little about the implications of what might happen if I were arrested, if I were hurt, or worse.\n\nTa-Nehisi Coates: Letter to my son\n\nAs is the case for many other parents, my children have pushed me to reprioritize, reevaluate, and reorient my relationship to the world. My decisions are no longer singularly centered on me. They are shaped by my commitment to these two small humans who think of me and my wife as their entire world. This is a new reality for many black parents who did not have children when the Movement for Black Lives began, but who have young children now in 2020. So much has changed in our lives even when it feels like so little in our country has. Our children have raised the stakes of this fight, while also shifting the calculus of how we move within it. It is one thing to be concerned for my own well-being, to navigate the country as a black man and to encounter its risks. It is another thing to be raising two black children and to consider both the dangers for yourself and the dangers that lie ahead for them.\n\nA week ago, George Floyd was killed by the Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin after Chauvin kept his knee planted on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. Floyd, in a distressing echo of Eric Garner's pleas five years ago, could be heard telling the officers around him that he could not breathe. Despite Floyd's appeals, according to a court document , \"the defendant had his knee on Mr. Floyd's neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds in total.\" It went on: \"Two minutes and 53 seconds of this was after Mr. Floyd was non-responsive.\"\n\nFloyd's death follows a string of recent incidents in which black people have been killed at the hands of police and vigilantes: Ahmaud Arbery, who was killed in South Georgia by a group of white men who chased him down while he was jogging and shot him as he struggled to escape. Breonna Taylor, who was killed when police officers in Louisville, Kentucky, entered her home with a search warrant looking for drugs that were being sold out of a house more than 10 miles away . There was also the incident involving Amy Cooper, a white woman in New York City's Central Park who was captured on camera falsely claiming that a black man named Christian Cooper was attacking her. I imagine how easily a different story might have been told if Christian Cooper had not recorded the incident, if Amy Cooper's distressed 911 call was the only piece of evidence from that moment. I keep thinking about that shift in the register of Amy Cooper's voice, making it sound as if she was actively being attacked while on the phone-how she knew exactly what that inflection would signal to the person on the other end of the line.\n\nSo much of this feels heartbreakingly similar to what transpired a few years ago. People took to the streets to protest the deaths of Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Renisha McBride, Jordan Davis, Freddie Gray, and others. And yet an obvious difference exists between this moment and that one: Today, all of this is transpiring during a global pandemic that is disproportionately killing black people in America. While some may claim, implicitly or explicitly, that this disparity is simply a result of cultural or individual shortcomings, black coronavirus deaths are not the result of personal failings. They are the result of housing segregation, medical discrimination, low-wage jobs, and lack of access to health care; they are the result of history.\n\nIbram X. Kendi: The greatest white privilege is life itself\n\nThis is part of the story that my parents had to explain to me, and that I will one day explain to my own children-that so many in our community find themselves in these conditions not because black people have done something wrong, but because of all the wrong that has been done to black people. Many are now familiar with the other conversations that black parents have with their children, the conversations in which parents attempt to tread the line of making their children aware of the realities of the world without making them feel somehow at fault. I experienced these conversations as a child , and will one day have to find a way to have them with my own children. A conversation that is more central to my life at the moment, however, is the one that black parents are having with one another.\n\nWith many of my friends in their early 30s, an increasing number are beginning to have children. We are new to parenting, and almost everyone's children are under 3 years old. For the past few years our text-message threads have been filled with advice on how to get your child to sleep through the night, where you could find the best deal on diapers, and who was going to the toddler birthday party that weekend. More recently, our Zoom calls and group chats have largely centered on checking in with one another amid the isolation of quarantine and the stream of black deaths, from both vigilantes and the virus. A common theme is that the need to be present for our children, who are so young and so in need of our constant attention, has distracted us from the television screens and phones we might otherwise be glued to. How we are at once grateful to be pulled away and stressed by the fact that the world feels more dangerous than we have ever known it to be. As one of my friends put it when thinking about having a 2-year-old son in this moment, it's the \"discomforting juxtaposition between the joy of seeing the world through his eyes and knowing how the world will see him one day.\"\n\nIn 2015, before I had children, I wrote a letter to the son I might one day have. In it I wrote, \"I hope to teach you so much of what my father taught me, but I pray that you live in a radically different world from the one that he and I have inherited.\" Now I do have a son, and all the fears, anxieties, and joys I wrote about five years ago are no longer an abstraction. They exist in his curly hair, his soft face, and his voice full of songs and questions. I am not sure how different the world I entered is from the one he has, but the past several weeks-to say nothing of the past several years-have made clear how fragile the project of progress truly is.\n\nRead: What's lost when black children are socialized into a white world\n\nAs we were leaving the park last week, my son saw a butterfly fluttering across the field. \"Caterpillar! Chrysalis! Butterfly!\" he sang to himself, taking pride in having recently learned the animal's life cycle. My daughter clapped and swung her head from side to side as he repeated the words. I watched the butterfly rise and fall in the wind, its thin yellow wings carrying its body in an uneven pirouette through the air.\n\nGeorge Floyd had children of his own, two daughters, Gianna and Roxie. I am left wondering what their memories of their father will be. Did they run through open fields together? Blow dandelions into the wind? Play tag until they fell breathless and jubilant to the ground? I hope that any memories they carry will supersede those of their father on the ground, begging for his life."

      "text": "The Black Lives Matter Movement Is Being Written Into the Streetscape\n\nBy rechristening streets and spaces for Black Lives Matter, communities are working to capture the momentum of the movement in a concrete way.\n\nIn the weeks following George Floyd's death, activists and city officials have painted dozens of American streets, walls, and public spaces with three words: black lives matter . In June, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio proposed co-naming a prominent street in every borough for the movement. One recent stop: Fifth Avenue, directly in front of Trump Tower. Joining activists and city workers in painting the pavement, de Blasio said, \"Black lives matter in our city, and Black lives matter in the United States of America. Let's show Donald Trump what he does not understand.\"\n\nLast month, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser was the first to rechristen a public space using the slogan: Two blocks across from the White House became Black Lives Matter Plaza, not long after the U.S. Park Police had violently teargassed peaceful protesters in nearby Lafayette Square. \"There was a dispute this week about whose street this is,\" Bowser's chief of staff tweeted when the plaza's bold yellow letters were unveiled. Bowser, like de Blasio, was claiming the space, not just for the city, but for Floyd.\n\nVisiting these sites has become a kind of pilgrimage for families. But some activists have criticized renaming streets as an empty gesture. In response to the creation of Black Lives Matter Plaza, the D.C. chapter of BLM tweeted , \"This is a performative distraction from real policy changes.\" Renaming the space was meaningless, they argued, because it did nothing to materially address the conditions that activists were protesting.\n\nDeirdre Mask: Where the streets have no name\n\nI've spent the past four years researching street names and what they reflect about communities. I understand that merely changing a street's name might be seen as \"performative,\" another show without substance. But performative can also refer to words that, as the philosopher J. L. Austin theorized, don't just speak but act. (Try arguing that the words I do , said before your beloved and a judge, don't actually do anything.) Here, the naming is the doing. And although changing street names alone cannot alter societal norms, it captures the momentum of the BLM movement in a concrete way.\n\nCities often rededicate streets to reflect changing values. But the rise of streets named for BLM has been swift compared with other efforts to rename spaces in honor of Black people. One of the most striking examples is the growing number of Martin Luther King Jr. Streets-perhaps the original Black Lives Matter Plazas-that have sprung up over the past half century. Today, more than 900 streets are named after King across America. And although many communities have welcomed the creation of BLM spaces, nothing demonstrates the real impact and importance of renaming public spaces more vividly than the fierce, persistent resistance to MLK streets.\n\nIn 2003, Irene Dobson, a retired kindergarten teacher living in Zephyrhills, Florida, asked the city council to rename a central street after MLK. It was close to the 40th anniversary of King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech, and she thought the town, which was founded as a retirement community for Union Army veterans, should honor him.\n\nDobson, who is African American, lived in a part of town called Otis Moody-named after the only local real-estate developer who would sell property to Black people in the 1950s. Her son had been one of the first to enroll in integrated schools. ( \"I raised eight children and none of those children are named 'Scared!'\" her mother used to tell her.) The city council agreed to Dobson's proposal, and signs for the new street began to go up.\n\nBut, as the historian Dylan Gottlieb has chronicled, residents fought to recall the decision. Some argued that having an MLK Street was bad for business. Others groused about the cost of changing identification and letterheads, even after the city council offered to send affected residents $50 to defray the costs. One resident grumbled that he did \"not want the fifty bucks ... I want my street name to stay Sixth Avenue.\" Few were as honest as the Zephyrhills old-timer who said, \"If I wanted to live in an integrated neighborhood I would have ... I don't think I'm being unreasonable wanting to live among whites.\" The city council reneged, and Sixth Avenue remained Sixth Avenue.\n\nRead: The last march of Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nZephyrhills is far from alone in rejecting King's name. Residents in San Diego and Portland once also opposed King streets, in racist shows of anger. Many Martin Luther King Streets that remain are located in Black neighborhoods, and some cities have hidden theirs away, far from city centers. In Eatonton, Georgia, for example, activists pushing for a new MLK Street in 1990 argued that, given King's message of integration, his name should be placed on an integrated street. Instead, it was placed in a Black neighborhood lined with houses, as one resident put it, \"fairly decent by black standards.\" In Chattanooga, Tennessee, a developer argued against naming West Ninth Street after King, saying that it \"is no longer a solid black street ... It is no longer a residential street or rundown business street. It is a top class business street that can play a great part in the future of Chattanooga.\"\n\nAnd although many MLK streets are thriving, Black people, too, have noticed the declining states of others-we all know the Chris Rock joke : If you find yourself on MLK Boulevard, run! Derek Alderman, a geographer who has written extensively on King streets, told me, \"It's ironic that we attached the name of one of the most famous civil-rights leaders of our time to the streets that speak to the very need to continue the civil-rights movement.\"\n\nBut the new Black Lives Matter streets are different, shouting the name of the movement in giant letters painted on the pavement itself. And, although Atlanta took eight years to honor King , its native son, with a street dedication, the BLM streets sprung up just days after Floyd's death. And in locating these BLM spaces in central, racially mixed areas, cities are at least trying to show that racism is not a Black issue, but everyone's issue; that Black pride is American pride.\n\nRead: There's no going back to 'normal'\n\nRenaming streets during times of social upheaval is hardly a new phenomenon. After the French Revolution, Parisians had a problem. France was new, but Paris was very old, reeking of the monarchy. As the scholar Priscilla Parkhurst Ferguson has written, the people decided that if Paris had to look the same, then at least it could sound different. Revolutionaries set out to rename the streets in a way that made sense to them. \"Is it not natural,\" one priest wrote, \"to go from Place de la Revolution to the rue de la Constitution and on to the rue du Bonheur?\"\n\nMany revolutionaries have long been concerned with changing not only their government's leadership, but also the cities in which they live. Physical spaces should reflect current values and ideals, not remind citizens of the past they have rejected. As Henri Lefebvre, a French Marxist theorist, has said, \"A revolution that does not produce a new space has not reached its full potential; indeed it has failed in that it has not changed life itself, but has merely changed ideological superstructures.\" The main street of Vukovar, Croatia, for example, has changed names six times in the past century-once with each new regime. Viewed through that lens, the speedy arrival of Black Lives Matter Plaza seems inevitable.\n\nBut there's more to it than that. Historians such as Pierre Nora have argued that the world's history is accelerating so quickly that we now use monuments, archives, and street names to record our memories. This year, watching monuments fall and newly named spaces emerge, I finally understand what this looks like in practice. Many people worry with good reason that the momentum of the Black Lives Matter movement will peter out, and that our attention will lurch toward a new existential crisis. Street names are one way to pin down the present and preserve it for future generations.\n\nToday, communities across the country are debating whose history to preserve, and how. Even organizers at the center of the BLM movement disagree on the new names. Activists in Birmingham , Alabama, for example, rejected efforts to create a Black Lives Matter Boulevard on 16th Street North, where four girls were murdered in a white-supremacist bombing in 1963, an attack King called \"one of the most vicious and tragic crimes ever perpetrated against humanity.\" \"The thought that our sacred grounds might be altered without any input from community members, activists, organizers, or elders-was traumatic,\" they wrote . \"To be clear-16th Street North is already the home of Black Lives Matter.\" A similar lack of community input was one reason Black voters supported the recall of a new MLK street name in Kansas City, Missouri , last year.\n\nRead: The enormous scale of this movement\n\nYet for all the disagreement, street names are hardly permanent. Activists in D.C. have already painted defund the police next to black lives matter , physically demonstrating that street names are part of a continuous conversation about what communities believe. The Warriors for Christ-deemed a hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center -have sued Mayor Bowser on the grounds that the new name violates their First Amendment rights by requiring them to \" kneel before the altar of Black Lives Matter cult .\" More recently, two people were charged with a hate crime for vandalizing a mural in Martinez, California, less than an hour after it was finished. \"This is not happening in my town,\" one shouted while rolling thick black paint over the yellow B .\n\nAs with King streets, these new BLM spaces remind us not only of the progress that our country has made, but also of the work that lies ahead. In Zephyrhills, Dobson's push to rename a street after MLK failed, but she did help exact one key compromise: Opponents agreed to keep commemorative MLK signs along Sixth Avenue. It wasn't quite a revolution, but it was a spark."

      "text": "Why Romney Marched\n\nThe path that led the Republican senator to march in a Black Lives Matter protest began half a century ago with his father.\n\nT he clip was short , but surreal: Mitt Romney-his face wrapped in a white mask, his sleeves rolled at the wrists-marches toward the White House alongside protesters chanting about police brutality. A reporter asks him what he's doing there, and the Republican senator from Utah responds: \"We need to stand up and say that black lives matter.\"\n\nWhen the video appeared on Twitter late yesterday afternoon, it drew a torrent of predictable reactions. Trumpites sneered and called him a loser. Leftists sneered and called him a poser. A small but vocal cheering section praised him for marching. And several people speculated-as they always do-that the 73-year-old senator was laying the groundwork for another presidential bid.\n\nIn reality, Romney's path to yesterday's Black Lives Matter protest began half a century earlier with his father-a man whose legacy has long shaped, and sometimes haunted, his son.\n\nGeorge Romney was the Republican governor of Michigan during the 1967 Detroit riots, which left 43 people dead and 2,000 buildings destroyed. In the aftermath of the violence, he addressed his constituents in a statewide broadcast.\n\nEliot A. Cohen: In the long run, Romney wins\n\n\"Some already are saying the answer is brute force such as would be used on mad dogs,\" the governor said. \"Others are questioning present social and economic programs because they claim Negroes don't appreciate what has already been done ... As citizens of Michigan, as Americans, we must unhesitatingly reject all these divisive courses.\"\n\nAs the journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones has detailed , George went on to enact a fair-housing law in his state, and called for an end to discriminatory zoning practices. When white voters sent him angry letters, he would write back, \"Force alone will not eliminate riots. We must eliminate the problems from which they stem.\"\n\nThe elder Romney was well known for such acts of defiance. Whether he was denouncing Barry Goldwater at the Republican National Convention or crusading against segregationist policies from inside the Nixon administration, he prided himself on putting principle over party-especially when it came to civil rights.\n\nFor Mitt, these heroic stories are never far away. He invokes them frequently in speeches and interviews-including several of my own conversations with him-and he seems to measure his own success by that of his father. In the 2014 Netflix documentary Mitt , Romney rhapsodizes to his family about the obstacles his late dad had to overcome.\n\n\"He was the real deal,\" Romney says. \"The guy was born in Mexico. He didn't have a college degree. He became head of a car company and became a governor ... I started where he ended up. I started off with money and education and Harvard Business School and Harvard Law School.\"\n\n\"I'm standing on his shoulders,\" he concludes.\n\nFor all his paternal admiration, Romney has seemed at times to define his political career in opposition to his father's. When he ran for president in 2012, he instructed aides to study George's short-lived presidential candidacy, which was torpedoed by an impulsive Vietnam War gaffe. As a candidate, Mitt Romney was cautious and calculating, and less than eager to confront the toxic forces that were taking over his party.\n\nRead: The liberation of Mitt Romney\n\nBut the Trump era has had a liberating effect on Romney. After Charlottesville, he said the president's response \"caused racists to rejoice.\" After the impeachment trial-when he became the only Senate Republican to vote for Trump's conviction-he told me he'd been guided by a favorite scripture of his father's. And last week, as protests spread across the country, he tweeted a photo of his father marching for civil rights.\n\nLike any self-aware politician, Romney is quick to deflect talk of how history will view him. (\"Frankly, I don't think I will be viewed by history,\" he told me in an interview last year.) But press him on the question hard enough, and some truth peeks out from beneath the self-deprecation.\n\n\"I think of my dad,\" he told me once. \"My dad was an extraordinary man, but I don't think history's going to record George Romney's impact on America ... I don't look at myself as being a historical figure.\"\n\nMaybe he's right. But just because he's not thinking about future historians doesn't mean he's unconcerned with his legacy. His father set a high bar-and as Romney nears the end of his career, he wants to be seen reaching for it."

      "text": "When Movements Are Guilty of What They Are Trying to Challenge\n\nIn some multiracial movements, unity means ignoring Black suffering.\n\nIn 2014, I was part of an activist organization that worked across various social issues-education equity, economic justice, labor rights, and environmental racism. We were hungry for a deeper structural understanding of relationships of power, and a strategy to transform those relationships. One afternoon, we met to discuss topics for future political education; we were holding webinars to, in part, encourage people to join the organization. Three African Americans, two Latinas, one white man, and one Asian man sat around the table. As we discussed political education, I suggested that we do a session on Black Lives Matter and Black resistance. By then, my Black Lives Matter co-founders and I had started the hashtag, built up social-media platforms to connect activists, and organized a freedom ride to Ferguson, Missouri, during the protests after Michael Brown was killed by the police.\n\nRead: Black Lives Matter just entered its next phase\n\nOne of the members of the group voiced concern that the drive for Black and brown unity would get lost if we did a session focused too much on Black people. I felt my face flush, and a wave of heat wash over my body, as I pushed back against the idea.\n\nBlack people across the country were protesting police violence, and she felt like we were talking about it too much? Black resistance did nothing to stand in the way of Black and brown unity. But the argument went nowhere; each side dug in. Eventually, the few Black members formed a caucus to discuss the activism erupting nationwide. To have to do that in a group formed for the purpose of building a freedom project felt devastating to me, yet I was grateful for the ingenuity of Black people to carve out space for ourselves in a sea of flaccid multiracialism.\n\nMovements for justice can be guilty of the same dynamics they seek to challenge. I have been to thousands of meetings, conferences, convenings, gatherings, and campaigns that failed to practice the principles they claimed to uphold. I've lost count of how many times activists would state a value such as \"Sisters at the center\" and then pretend not to notice that women did the bulk of the emotional and administrative work while men did the intellectual work. I've also been involved with organizations that focus on Black and brown unity, but that fail to recognize the issues that drive the groups apart.\n\nMovements that bring together people of all races are vital to building the world we deserve. However, sometimes we are so concerned with coming together that we don't do the work to stay together. Like any good relationship, unity takes effort-together, and apart.\n\nI was brought up in an organizing tradition that valued solidarity among oppressed people. Linda Burnham, a leader in the Third World Women's Alliance, and a dear friend and mentor, used the term people of color as a way to get those who are not white to see common cause with one another. However, I've struggled with the nagging feeling that these alliances, as they are currently conceptualized and practiced, are in some cases exploitative. Unity, of course, is important-but real unity cannot happen if we avoid addressing difficult contradictions, such as anti-Black sentiment and action among minority communities. A unified coalition also has no hope if it does not understand, viscerally and intellectually, that Black communities, in particular, are not just cultural cachet. Our suppression is how white supremacy is able to rule.\n\nOver the course of my work, I've encountered many people I call \"Black and brown unity defenders,\" who seem to feel that addressing specific instances of Black oppression somehow violates the alliance among people of color. In some ways, I get it. Communities of color lack power in so many aspects of our lives that when any one group's singular dynamics of oppression or disenfranchisement break through the mainstream veil, others try to attach to the moment to create more space for an expansive and nuanced conversation.\n\nHowever, true solidarity includes showing up to bear witness to another's unique experiences with oppression and marginalization. If my best friend tells me that she and her partner are breaking up, solidarity is not interrupting her tearful testimony to say \"I too have had breakups! Let me tell you about my breakup!\" Solidarity is listening, asking questions, and being there for her-to let her vent, to help her figure out how to rebuild her life, to offer support, and to know when to give her space. And although being there for a friend is not the same as showing up for a protest, the lessons of how to be a good friend are instructive on the broader social scale.\n\nClint Smith: Becoming a parent in the age of Black Lives Matter\n\nSimilarly, declaring that Black lives matter does not negate the significance of the lives of non-Black people of color. It's also okay for Black people to seek one another out for healing, for strategy, for joy, without the watchful, and at times tokenizing, gaze of other communities. For some non-Black activists, that sort of congregating feels too exclusive, too divisive.\n\nNo multiracial movement can grow unless and until it does the work to make Black people a strong and vibrant component of that movement. Black people cannot be strong and vibrant unless we have the space we need to challenge and comfort one another about what it means to live as a Black person in America.\n\nA multiracial movement must create a place for its members to examine their relationships to one another, with all of their contradictions. It can provide opportunities for healing old wounds, for affirming the connections among us, and for forging new ones. Doing this work ensures that we can all go out into the larger world, link arms with other communities that share a common cause, and advance our goals. Unity isn't the blurring of our experiences and our conditions for the sake of peace. It's standing together in the muck of our differences and declaring that we refuse to be divided by the people who are responsible for our collective misery.\n\nThis piece was adapted from Garza's recent book, The Purpose of Power ."

      "text": "What Happens When a Slogan Becomes the Curriculum\n\nA curriculum inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement is spreading, raising questions about the line between education and indoctrination.\n\nLast month, a public-school district that serves mostly elementary and middle-school students in Evanston, Illinois, held its third annual Black Lives Matter at School Week of Action-using a curriculum, created in collaboration with Black Lives Matter activists and the local teachers' union, that introduces children as young as 4 and 5 to some of America's most complex and controversial subjects. For example, parents of kindergartners in District 65 were asked to spend time at home discussing a book on race that teachers had read aloud to their children.\n\nNot My Idea: A Book About Whiteness , by Anastasia Higginbotham, begins with a white mother turning off a television set to prevent her little daughter from seeing footage of a white policeman shooting a Black man. \"You don't need to worry about this,\" the mother says. \"You're safe. Understand? Our family is kind to everyone. We don't see color.\" The book corrects the mother: \"Deep down, we all know color matters,\" it states. \"Skin color makes a difference in how the world sees you and in how you see the world ... It makes a difference in how much trouble seems to find you or let you be.\" The book teaches that the truth about \"your own people, your own family\" can be painful. Next to an illustration of the mother locking her car door and grasping her wallet while driving in a neighborhood where Black children are standing on the street, the narrator notes, \"Even people you love might behave in ways that show they think they are the good ones.\" Later, the little girl castigates her mother for trying to hide the police shooting and other racism. \"Why didn't anyone teach me real history?\" she yells. \"I do see color ... You can't hide what's right in front of me. I know that what that police officer did was wrong!\"\n\nThe book instructs a young white reader that she doesn't need to \"defend\" racism, and it presents her with a stark decision. An illustration depicts a devil holding a \"contract binding you to whiteness.\" It reads:\n\nYou get:\n\n✓stolen land\n\n✓stolen riches\n\n✓special favors†\n\nWHITENESS gets:\n\n✓to mess endlessly with the lives of your friends, neighbors, loved ones, and all fellow humans of COLOR\n\n✓your soul\n\nSign below:\n\n_____________\n\n†Land, riches, and favors may be revoked at any time, for any reason.\n\nIn Evanston, parents are asked to quiz their kids on whiteness and give them approachable examples of \"how whiteness shows up in school or in the community.\" In its focus on \"whiteness\" and its invitation to readers to challenge racism by interrogating and rejecting it, the worldview of Not My Idea is similar to that of Robin DiAngelo's White Fragility , now a staple of diversity-and-inclusion programs and anti-racism training. Not My Idea is also a jarringly didactic assignment for kindergartners.\n\nThe BLM at School movement is gaining momentum in Democratic strongholds around the country, where millions have felt impelled to respond to the high-profile police killings of Black Americans and the inequities that such incidents expose. Parents and educators in these enclaves are largely united in believing that Black lives matter, and that schools should encourage students of all ages to reject racism and remedy its injustices, much as previous generations of schoolchildren were taught to \"Just Say No to Drugs\" and to \"Reduce, Reuse, Recycle.\"\n\nIn all such campaigns, a distinction can be drawn between the galvanizing slogan, which by design is popular and difficult to oppose, and the ideological and policy goals of the people promoting it. In other words, people might believe deeply that Black lives matter while disagreeing with Black Lives Matter organizers about specific claims. But for the BLM at School movement, agreeing with the broad slogan implies a particular approach to anti-racist activism-one that draws on academic approaches such as critical race theory and intersectionality ; rejects individualism and aspirational color-blindness; and acts in solidarity with projects including decoloniality , anti-capitalism, and queer liberation.\n\nIndeed, with the educational resources it creates and curates, the national BLM at School coalition unapologetically aims to create a new generation of allied activists. And that influence shows in Evanston, where, starting in the spring of 2019, the District 65 Educators' Council--the local teachers' union--proposed to work with administrators to develop a local BLM at School curriculum. By autumn, the school board had approved a week of lessons. The curriculum-which district leaders say aligns with Illinois social-studies standards and guidelines-draws on the materials and guiding principles of the national initiative while also adding texts such as Not My Idea , which doesn't appear on the national BLM at School's current list of recommended books.\n\nBoth in the material recommended by the national movement and in uniquely local lessons, some prompts to think critically are presented alongside other material that crosses a line from education into indoctrination. Educators should inform students and teach them how to think for themselves about how to improve the world, not inculcate any particular faction's agenda or viewpoints as if they were presumptively good and true. The flaws in BLM at School curricula in Evanston and elsewhere aren't a failure of activism--national and local Black Lives Matter advocates have promoted their worldview quite effectively. They are failures of the public-school system-albeit failures that would require extraordinary effort and skill to avoid, given a curriculum built atop an activist movement.\n\nI say that as a strong proponent of significant ideas dear to Black Lives Matter activists. My prior reporting and commentary on BLM has focused on its many interventions in the police-reform debate. I have praised the sophisticated reform agenda set forth under the auspices of its Campaign Zero faction. More recently, I've watched the ascendance of a separate BLM faction that wants to \"defund the police.\" Although I prefer the police-reform approach, activists of all sorts should get a hearing when they put forth ideas that might improve public policy or the public-education curriculum. And after I reviewed District 65's BLM at School curriculum, my impression was that educators aligned with the movement had recommended some valuable material, including lessons about restorative justice and the underappreciated benefits of living in households where members of three or more generations are all in routine contact with one another.\n\nMuch of the curriculum is an easy fit with community values in Evanston. The overwhelming majority of the city's roughly 75,000 residents are liberal and progressive. Joe Biden won 91 percent of the vote there in November. (One of the 18 schools in District 65 is in neighboring Skokie, another strongly Democratic-leaning Chicago suburb.) Yet even in a resolutely Democratic area, some self-described liberals and progressives, who are happy to have their children taught that Black lives matter, have misgivings about public schools encouraging their children to adopt the expansive agenda of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\n\"There's a lot of things to love in this BLM week-such as teaching empathy and tolerance, helping students recognize bias,\" one parent told me in an email. \"I know the district, and the people behind this are well intentioned. They want to build a better, more just world. But this curriculum crosses a line that public school educators, regardless of political views, need to respect.\" He continued,\n\nThey present every issue with such moral certainty-like there is no other viewpoint. And we're definitely seeing this in my daughter. She can make the case for defunding the police, but when I tried to explain to her why someone might have a Blue Lives Matter sign, why some families support the police, she wasn't open to considering that view. She had a blinding certainty that troubled me. She thinks that even raising the question is racist. If she even hears a squeak of criticism of BLM, or of an idea that's presented as supporting equity, she's quick to call out racism.\n\nThis parent requested anonymity because he fears the potential career repercussions of publicly criticizing an initiative touted as combatting racism. In his telling, his school district's leadership frames any criticism of its \"equity\" curricula as \"white supremacist thinking.\" Superintendent Devon Horton declined my requests for an interview, but District 65 put me in touch with Stacy Beardsley, the assistant superintendent of curriculum and instruction. Parent feedback, she told me, is one of the factors that will inform the review of the entire District 65 social-studies curriculum currently under way. Beardsley also argued that the district wants students to think critically about what they're taught. \"We are not in the business of telling kids what to think and to feel,\" she said. \"We want to put out information and give kids the skill to interrogate those sources, to drive inquiry, to ask questions, and ultimately to be critically conscious.\"\n\nThe idea that became Black Lives Matter at School dates back to October 19, 2016, when thousands of Seattle educators went to school in Black Lives Matter T-shirts. That news reached a group of educators in Philadelphia, who were inspired to develop a week-long curriculum grounded in their understanding of the principles of the decentralized activist movement. Soon, educators and schools in more than 20 cities from Los Angeles to Boston participated in what the BLM at School website calls a \"national uprising\" involving \"lessons about structural racism, intersectional black identities, black history, and anti-racist movements.\" The initiative has been spreading ever since.\n\nThe committee that formulated the current national BLM at School classroom resources is chaired by Christopher Rogers, a veteran of organizing work in the Philadelphia public-education system who is now pursuing a doctoral degree in literacy studies at the University of Pennsylvania. Rogers grew up in nearby Chester, a city of 34,000 that frequently ranks as one of Pennsylvania's poorest and most crime-plagued, and he attended public schools still shaped by the segregation of bygone eras. \"We went through every type of educational reform that the state threw at our schools,\" he told me in a phone interview. \"There was a lot of local corruption, the schools were a part of the dysfunction, and we never really recovered.\" As he watched a series of state-appointed private contractors fail to improve local schools, he began to feel that forces beyond the control of his community were keeping it down. When he moved to Philadelphia in 2012, those failures made him wary of efforts driven by education consultants to close troubled public schools in the city. \"This was hitting Black and brown communities,\" he said, \"and it's where my inroads into organizing began.\"\n\nToday, he wants kids to be taught about housing rights, eviction, redlining, police abuses, urban pollution, and all of the other systems that harm the lives of Black people, in the hope that theirs will be the generation that fixes those problems. \"When we say Black lives matter,\" he said, \"how are we articulating that in rooms and institutions that govern people's lives?\"\n\nTo help educators shape their lessons about such wide-ranging matters, the BLM at School website lists 13 \" guiding principles .\" They include values such as empathy and diversity, an embrace of restorative justice, a rejection of ageism, and commitments to lift up LGBTQ people, Black women, and Black families. The \"Black villages\" principle declares that \"we are committed to disrupting the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure requirement by supporting each other as extended families and 'villages' that collectively care for one another, and especially 'our' children to the degree that mothers, parents and children are comfortable.\"\n\nThe national curriculum itself is expansive , broken down by grade level, from kindergarten through adult education. \"It accumulates year over year,\" Rogers told me. \"We're inviting educators from all across the country to think about resources they've utilized in the past within their own classrooms and thinking about how to share those ideas, lessons, and suggestions.\" An all-volunteer committee has the final say on what makes the cut. Local districts and individual teachers can then adapt those recommendations to their own classrooms. They can and do add unapproved material too. Rogers described the BLM at School curriculum as a starting point. \"We know this isn't the full package, so to speak,\" he said, \"but it can give a trajectory that moves educators in a proper direction toward finding content that can teach the legacies of Black resistance.\"\n\nAlthough the version of BLM at School adopted by Evanston's District 65 is too expansive to discuss exhaustively here, zeroing in on particular lessons underscores the difficulty of casting complex historical and social issues in doctrinaire terms.\n\nNot My Idea , for example, seems to teach children with white parents that they should not count on their goodness or trustworthiness. And as someone whose profession requires watching awful videos of police killings, I would strongly urge parents to switch off a TV rather than let their young child see one-a choice that the book seems to criticize. Many parents will also find the book's subject matter too mature for kids not yet in the first grade. Denisha Jones, a Sarah Lawrence College scholar active in the BLM at School movement, articulated a related concern in a 2020 Zoom discussion with other educators. Teachers must be careful about exposing young kids to horrific material, she said, because the movement's goal is \"to affirm Blackness in children, especially young children,\" and \"that needs to happen before we even get to America's history of slavery ... It is not appropriate for really young children that they only hear about Black history through a lens of slavery and civil rights.\"\n\nSome books chosen for the Evanston BLM at School curriculum are inspired responses to the question of how to introduce sensitive subjects to young children. When developing an explicitly queer- and trans-affirming curriculum, per the BLM at School guiding principles, for instance, what does one teach kindergartners? A book in the national and Evanston curricula, Julián Is a Mermaid , makes its point gently, with gorgeous watercolor illustrations and storytelling that casts the title character's identity in positive, nondogmatic terms. The publisher's plot summary captures the gist:\n\nWhile riding the subway home from the pool with his abuela one day, Julián notices three women spectacularly dressed up. Their hair billows in brilliant hues, their dresses end in fishtails, and their joy fills the train car. When Julián gets home, daydreaming of the magic he's seen, all he can think about is dressing up just like the ladies in his own fabulous mermaid costume: a butter-yellow curtain for his tail, the fronds of a potted fern for his headdress. But what will Abuela think about the mess he makes-and even more importantly, what will she think about how Julián sees himself?\n\nThe story would be a blessing in a home with a gender-nonconforming child or parent, and just as useful for children who feel different from their peers in any other way.\n\nMore heavy-handed is a lesson called \"Empathy, Loving Engagement, and Restorative Justice,\" included in a slide deck from Evanston's third-grade curriculum. The lesson begins with a \"teaching point\" that states, \"Today I'm going to teach you about what the Black Lives Matter movement is and why it's necessary.\" Later slides show photographs of local Black Lives Matter protests. A leading question near the end of the lesson asks students, \"Why is it important to learn about Black Lives Matter in school?\" In most circumstances, public schools should help students understand significant protest movements that are shaping their world, and Black Lives Matter easily crosses that threshold. But flatly describing the movement as \"necessary\" is a value judgment.\n\nAmericans pursue racial justice through a variety of political ideologies, policy agendas, and tactics. Kids should know that a \"correct\" approach cannot be identified objectively. One might agree that Black lives matter and that Black people have been unfairly harmed by historical racism without also endorsing, say, \"Black villages\" or other distinct ideas embraced by activists. The Evanston curriculum elides that distinction. The only critique of the Black Lives Matter approach to social-justice activism that students get is literally a caricature. In the first panel of a cartoon included in the lesson materials , a person says, \"Well I think that all lives matter.\" In panel two, while holding a fire hose, he says, \"We should care exactly equally at all times about everything.\" In panel three, he stands in front of two houses, one that's burning, one that isn't, and sprays water on the house that isn't on fire. \" All houses matter,\" he says.\n\nThis reference to \"all lives matter\" is included only to tee up a rejection of it. Students shown just that cartoon wouldn't understand why the San Francisco 49ers player Richard Sherman, who is Black, used the phrase \"all lives matter\" and expressed some discomfort with BLM. But they should.\n\nAnother lesson, taught to seventh graders , even more clearly illustrates the shortcomings of operating within the ideological confines of the Black Lives Matter movement rather than combining insights from it and other sources. The lesson asks, \"Why is it important to recognize that black women and girls matter?\" This slide follows:\n\nThe lesson goes on to introduce the concept of intersectionality -defined as a system of \"oppressions and privileges that overlap and reinforce each other\"-then moves on to a list of Black women who have been killed by police. In an accompanying video, the legal theorist Kimberlé Crenshaw says, \"Police violence against Black women is very real. Why is it that their lost lives don't generate the same amount of media attention and communal outcry as the lost lives of their fallen brothers?\" By asking that question, activists help draw attention to some police killings that warranted close press scrutiny.\n\nCases in which police officers violate the civil rights of Black women are indeed worthy of study. But sitting through the slideshow, which asserts that to be Black and female is to be \"the most unprotected person in America,\" many students might come away with the impression that Black women are the demographic group most likely to be killed by police in America. That is false.\n\nAccording to a 2019 paper published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the lifetime risk is highest for Black males: About 96 in 100,000 are killed by police. Latino men have an estimated lifetime risk of 53 per 100,000; white men, 39 per 100,000. For Black women, the authors find, the lifetime risk of being killed by police is 2.4 to 5.4 per 100,000. That's higher than the comparable figure for Latina and white women (2 per 100,000), but much lower than the rate for men.\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement is within its rights to focus exclusively on Black people killed by police-regardless of whether one believes, as I do, that Americans should also know names such as Daniel Shaver , a white man killed by police in 2016. Speeches by Black Lives Matter activists need not include the disclaimer that white men are far more likely to be killed by police than Black women are. But the public-school system should tell the whole truth to those in its care, even if it undermines a narrative that activists champion.\n\n\"I believe in the importance of every school district, including my own, moving away from a traditionally white-centric voice to a broader and more truthful view of history that acknowledges the wrongs of both past and present, recognizes white privilege and honors the black experience and the experience of other minority groups,\" one Evanston parent told me in an email. \"I think we've come to the point, however, where our children (all children) are being used as pawns ... I feel we can and should work together for a more just, equitable world,\" the parent continued, \"but don't believe that one political organization with its own idea of how to get there should be the arbiter of that progress.\" This parent, too, requested anonymity, writing, \"There is no room for that position right now in this town.\"\n\nI emailed all seven members of the District 65 school board for comment. One member, Joseph Hailpern, replied, emphasizing that he spoke only for himself. On the matter of parental unease, he wrote, in part,\n\nAs a white man I'd be lying if I said there were not parts that made me feel uneasy. It is hard to have your child come home and point out to you a privilege you have long held, but never noticed. I feel so good knowing that my children are learning the value of community, respect, and fairness in a way I was never discretely taught in school. Equity is a journey for some, a fight for others, and a distance hope for too many. If this makes the long term goals in our community more attainable, a bit of unease on my white part is acceptable and necessary to me.\n\nTo concerns that parts of the curriculum look like indoctrination by activists, he responded that teachers know how to \"passionately bring about the next generation of great citizens\" without imposing any viewpoints of their own. Some people understand a curriculum as a textbook or set of materials, he wrote, while for others, \"it is the sequence of big ideas, enduring understandings, and essential questions\" that guide learners. \"This week is filled with huge questions for children and teachers about what kind of world we want to share together,\" he continued. \"It is current social studies rather than what parents are used to. In that it is very different, but highly relevant and necessary.\"\n\nAs in any school district, the best teachers in Evanston likely improved on many of the prepared lessons. (The worst, of course, might have degraded them.) But one cannot simply presume that all teachers want to approach this material without imposing their own views. Indeed, many teachers aligned with Black Lives Matter explicitly reject a neutral posture. This issue was the subject of a 2020 webinar titled \"Black Lives Matter at School: A Discussion With Educators on the Intersections of Activism and Pedagogy.\" As one participant asked, \"How do you talk and teach about the historical moment, massive Black Lives Matter protests, and uprising and rebellion with your students? How do you do that in a way where you're wearing the educator hat and also an activist hat?\"\n\nAnswers varied, but most participants seemed to reject the model of the neutral educator. Typical of the discussion were comments by Matthew Vaughn-Smith, a Baltimore-area assistant principal, who said, \"I don't believe in a neutral educator ... You, as an anti-racist educator, have to take a stance.\"\n\nAs an alumnus of 14 years of Catholic education, I know that a few dogmatic teachers do not reliably yield lifelong believers. And I happen to agree that, on certain basic questions, educators should not be evenhanded. Do the lives of all of their students have value? Yes. Should students be acculturated to participate in civic life to improve the world? Yes. Should they be discriminated against because of their race or religion or gender or disability status? No. The list goes on. But educators should be neutral as to the question \"Should my students embrace the narrative and policy agenda of the Black Lives Matter movement and become activists on its behalf?\"\n\nAnd educators should not be neutral as to the question \"Should my students be taught what to think, or how to think?\" Schools should do the latter. They should promote truth seeking and diversity of thought. They should recognize the imperative in a pluralistic democracy of understanding others' beliefs and the importance of subjecting one's own beliefs to scrutiny, given society's complexity and the fallibility of well-intentioned judgments. And they should understand the folly of treating profound disagreements as if they foreclosed the possibility of cooperation.\n\nThose goals could conceivably be advanced with an improved BLM at School Week of Action curriculum in future years, but they would be easier to achieve if District 65 broadened its focus and dedicated a week to all the contrasting civil-rights approaches taken by other people who believe that Black lives matter.\n\nStudents could learn, as they do now, about the activism practiced by Martin Luther King Jr., by the Black Power movement, and by adherents of critical-race-theory traditions. But lessons could also discuss the present-day approaches of Black churches; Barack Obama's criticism of \"wokeness\" and his embrace of democratic persuasion; the Black conservatism of Thomas Sowell and Shelby Steele; the aspirational color blindness advocated by Ward Connerly; Barbara and Karen Fields's critique of \"racecraft\"; the entrepreneurial successs of Oprah Winfrey, Michael Jordan, and Jay-Z; and many more besides.\n\nIn fact, while curricula and teachers will always warrant scrutiny, perhaps the quality of Evanston students' education during the district's three Black Lives Matter at School action weeks is best measured by parents asking whether their kids can now accurately explain not only the values and beliefs of Black Lives Matter but also the strongest criticisms of the movement's approach. Can children describe how it compares with other forms of civil-rights activism, why many anti-racists embrace it, and why other anti-racists partly or wholly reject it? In persuading Evanston educators to adopt a BLM at School curriculum, Black Lives Matter activists did their job. Did the District 65 public schools do theirs?\n\nIf you're a parent or educator with thoughts on this article, or concerns about public or private schooling in your community, I'd love to hear them, regardless of your perspective.

      "text": "Identity Politics Loses Its Power\n\nBlack Lives Matter's statement on Kamala Harris seems to signal a shift.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nB lack Lives Matter's persuasive power and influence climaxed in 2020, in the reckoning that followed the murder of George Floyd. It was a time of rare consensus, when some two-thirds of Americans expressed support for the cause, according to the Pew Research Center. But by last year, only half of Americans continued to support BLM, and less than a quarter did so strongly. \"A majority of Americans say the increased focus on issues of race and racial inequality in the past three years hasn't led to changes that have improved the lives of Black people,\" Pew found .\n\nNow BLM is weighing in on the candidacy of Vice President Kamala Harris. One might assume, based on the group's foundational emphasis on identity politics, that its support for a liberal Black woman would be full-throated. Instead, I was surprised to see it release a statement last week that was strikingly critical of the Democratic Party's decision to elevate Harris without a primary.\n\n\"Democratic Party elites and billionaire donors are attempting to manipulate Black voters by anointing Kamala Harris and an unknown vice president as the new Democratic ticket without a primary vote by the public,\" the statement reads. \"While the potential outcome of a Harris presidency may be historic, the process to achieve it must align with true democratic values. We have no idea where Kamala Harris stands on the issues.\" The group called for a \"virtual snap primary\" that would give voters a chance to voice their preferences and concerns. Bernie Sanders famously argued that \"it is not good enough for somebody to say, I'm a woman; vote for me .\" Now Black Lives Matter seems to be arguing that it is no longer good enough to say: I am a Black woman; vote for me .\n\nFrom the November 2023 issue: The Kamala Harris problem\n\nRefreshingly, Harris herself has not relied on this argument, focusing instead on uniting liberals and their allies to defeat Donald Trump. At her first rally after President Joe Biden left the race, Harris vowed to protect reproductive rights, strengthen the middle class, and fight for a future \"where no child has to grow up in poverty.\" Still, her candidacy immediately inspired waves of identitarianism among various Democratic constituencies. Hundreds of thousands of Democratic voters segregated themselves by race and gender to attend fundraising calls on Zoom , as if preemptively highlighting superficial differences could somehow help them come together at a later date. Such tactics don't reflect the fact that many voters are rejecting identity politics, which have only exacerbated the divisions they purported to heal. Coming at a time when Trump has been entrenching counterintuitive gains among Black voters and other minority groups, Democrats' emphasis on race and identity risks undermining Harris instead of helping her.\n\nThere will be no snap primary: With three months until the election, the Democratic Party is saying that it's already too late. But Black Lives Matter's intervention will have been a deeply patriotic and beneficial one if it forces Democratic elites to take seriously the reality that the country is no longer interested in checking boxes and marking \"firsts\" only for the sake of it, and if it signals a correction to the excesses and miscalculations of the past few years.\n\nWhen I reached out to ask Black Lives Matter whether this was an accurate read of the group's intentions, a spokesperson did not follow up after several back-and-forths. I posed the question instead to a few scholars of BLM. Those I spoke with said they did not see an ideological about-face.\n\n\"BLM centers Black lives because they see these lives as an exemplary case of the denial of democratic freedoms and rights,\" the Brown University political scientist Melvin Rogers told me: BLM's \"identity-based politics are not about identity for identity's sake but about addressing systemic inequities and ensuring that marginalized communities have a voice in shaping democratic institutions. Given the historical context of exclusion in the United States, they elevate identity as a means of self-affirmation, but they frame this within a larger commitment to democratic engagement, process, and reform.\" He thought the call for snap primaries was, in part, a matter of strategic influence-\"a tactical move\" to try to ensure that BLM would have an \"impact in shaping the Democratic platform.\"\n\nBut whether BLM intended to signal a departure from the lockstep ideology of the past few years, or whether Rogers is right that it's been asking Americans to think beyond the narrow confines of race all along, the statement is a stark reminder of the limits of identity politics.\n\nB lack Lives Matter was founded in 2013, after George Zimmerman was acquitted in the killing of the teenager Trayvon Martin. Through the decade that followed, BLM, as both a movement and an organization, forced Americans to examine complex social, cultural, and political questions through the flattening lens of group identity and race. It was not at all sufficient, activists organized under its banner argued, to view what happened to Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, or to Floyd in Minneapolis, only in terms of police brutality or the precarity of the lower classes. A few years before Floyd was asphyxiated by a police officer who kneeled on his neck while other officers milled about refusing to intervene, Tony Timpa, an unarmed white man, was killed in Texas in near-identical circumstances. But that connection was rarely drawn. In some quarters, it was tantamount to an expression of anti-Blackness to point out any equivalence.\n\nDavid Frum: The Harris gamble\n\nAfter Hillary Clinton's unexpected loss to Trump in 2016, the intellectual historian Mark Lilla posed what at the time seemed a controversial question: How should America's unique and beautiful diversity shape our politics? \"In recent years American liberalism has slipped into a kind of moral panic about racial, gender and sexual identity that has distorted liberalism's message and prevented it from becoming a unifying force capable of governing,\" he wrote in a viral New York Times op-ed . \"One of the many lessons of the recent presidential election campaign and its repugnant outcome is that the age of identity liberalism must be brought to an end.\" That two election cycles hence, even a constituency founded on race-first activism such as Black Lives Matter has come to echo a version of that moderating sentiment should register not merely as an indictment of the Democratic Party's history of simplistic thinking about race; it should serve as an emergency wake-up call.\n\nHarris-much like J. D. Vance-is particularly vulnerable to the liabilities of appealing to identity over substance. Trump has already tried to challenge Harris's racial authenticity, suggesting that she positioned herself as Black only when it became politically expedient to do so: \"She was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden she made a turn and she became a Black person,\" he said on Wednesday, during a simultaneously ingratiating and contentious appearance in front of the National Association of Black Journalists. The best way to undermine this kind of cheap rhetorical gambit is to eschew arguments based on identity in the first place.\n\nIt may turn out that Harris is precisely the leader this moment demands. But that cannot be assumed. \"Installing Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee and an unknown vice president without any public voting process would make the modern Democratic Party a party of hypocrites,\" BLM warned. \"It would undermine their credibility on issues related to democracy. Imagine our first Black woman president not having won some sort of public nomination process. The pundits would immediately label it as affirmative action or a DEI move, and any progress made by a President Harris would be on shaky foundations.\"\n\nBLM understands that Harris will not become president just because she is some avatar of generic intersectional identity, and that she would have been better off if given the chance to prove herself deserving of voters' support through a fair and transparent primary process. Put bluntly, descendants of American slaves should not feel the need to search for our redemption or sense of representation through the symbolic ascendance of a child of Indian and Jamaican immigrants merely because she listens to Beyoncé and has tan skin. The presumption that Black politics is or ought to be formed in the epidermis has always been patronizingly false. The Black voters defecting to Trump have recognized this, and the leaders of Black Lives Matter have now stated it plainly. Will the Democratic Party take note?"

's famed \" Black Lives Matter \" street mural on Monday, in the latest fallout from anti-diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) sabre rattling by Republican politicians. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser announced the decision last week shortly after after House Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-GA) introduced a bill that would force the city to get rid of the mural or risk losing its funding from the federal government. \"The mural inspired millions of people and helped our city through a very painful period, but now we can't afford to be distracted by meaningless congressional interference,\" Bowser wrote on X. The mural covers a two-block-long pedestrian stretch of 16th Street NW in downtown Washington with the letters of the iconic social justice movement's name painted in 35-foot-tall letters. Clyde's legislation also calls on the city to rename the two blocks to Liberty Plaza from Black Lives Matter Plaza. The mural was drawn by D.C. Department of Public Works staff in June 2020, during the nationwide protests that followed the murder of George Floyd by former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. Since taking office, President Donald Trump has moved to shut down diversity initiatives across the federal government and remove symbols seen as endorsing DEI.\n\nsean.craig@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Here's the Real Takeaway From Black Lives Matter's Sketchy Finances\n\nFollowing the reveal of the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation's IRS tax documents, it's now safe to say that there's something questionable going on at the social justice nonprofit.\n\nAccording to the group's Form 990, first reported by Associated Press , BLM is worth nearly $42 million in net assets-after spending more than $37 million of the $90 million it previously had on high-end real estate, familiar consultants, ambitious grants, and more.\n\nOne of the more concerning situations revealed by the financial disclosures is the fact that co-founder Patrisse Cullors was the foundation board's sole voting director, and held no board meetings, before stepping down last year. Under her leadership, Cullors authorized a six-figure payout to be given to her child's father for various services, paid $1.8 million to companies owned by her relatives, and ensured that her brother, Paul Cullors, was one of the highest-paid employees of BLM.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThis is yet another wave of bad news for Cullors, who has constantly denied financial impropriety, as she has previously tried to quell any growing concerns around her decision-making. These tax documents not only proved that Cullors lied about misusing some of the funds (such as hosting a birthday party for her son and throwing a private Biden inauguration celebration in the multimillion dollar property intended for activists and creators), but that she did so repeatedly.\n\n\"I'm a human being that has made mistakes that want to change, want to challenge those mistakes and want to learn from those mistakes,\" Cullors told Trymaine Lee of MSNBC's \"Into America\" podcast on Monday. \"And I think what's been hard is feeling like there isn't room and space for that.\"\n\nWhile all of this news is disappointing and alarming, there's one truth that we should all take in: All politics is local, including the grassroots activism it takes to organize.\n\nFor years, much of what Cullors now describes as the \"white guilt money\" has been geared towards national organizations, like BLM, that say their missions are focused on addressing racial injustice. Cullors once made headlines for saying that hearing the term \"990s\" was \"triggering\" to her-but that's what nonprofit transparency looks like. If the public at large wanted to fund multimillion-dollar villas, top-flight exec travel, and cashed-out gigs for the founder's relatives, they could have easily donated to the Trump Foundation.\n\nLocal Black Lives Matter chapters across the country have for years raised concerns over how the national arm had been leaving them fiscally malnourished. And that this could happen as their co-founders garnered lucrative book deals, speaking engagements, and career opportunities.\n\nFor donors of all identities, giving to the national organization felt like an easy way to maximize impact. But I would bet that most donors are probably furious to see their money going towards anything but direct action on the ground.\n\nIt's hard not to imagine how this money could have best been spent if local chapters and other more direct on-the-ground activist groups were given a larger chunk of this money to do the actual work. To now be fully aware that a great deal of the $90 million raised for BLM during the racial uprisings of 2020 didn't actually go to fuel the continuation of similar activity on the local level-that feels like betrayal. Even worse, it's hard not to consider such fundraising as anything more than just a big grift.\n\nTo those who have been giving money to the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, now is the time to stop.\n\nThis is not to say that you shouldn't give money to Black activism efforts, but to rethink who and where you're giving it to. While it will require some additional work on your end to find local groups worthy of your financial support, such funds will make a more meaningful impact than whatever trickles down from some giant conglomerate-especially one that can afford to buy mansions, while many neighborhood orgs can barely keep the lights on.\n\nTo cite one personal example, I made the informed decision to cease donating to national political LGBTQIA organizations in 2016. The impetus was the Human Rights Coalition-a big national org-dragging its feet on rescinding its endorsement of former Republican Sen. Mark Kirk, who had made racist remarks at the time. As a Black queer man, I was furious that the organization had decided to use diverse resources to back a Senate Republican who they hadn't fully vetted for problematic behavior.\n\nSince then, I've found more pride in direct giving funds and donating volunteer hours to local nonprofits that do more intersectional work, such as the William Way LGBT Community Center in my own backyard of Philadelphia.\n\nAt a time when resources are scarce and there appear to be more problems than solutions, it's time for us all to remember the importance of local grassroots efforts that have always empowered the people and politics. If the power is truly to the people, so should the funding-and such funding should never fall onto $6 million mansions and VIP parties, but on the ground where the people are.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Debunking the Right-Wing Lie That Black Lives Matter Got $82 Billion From Corporations\n\nWhen Silicon Valley Bank collapsed last month , right-wingers predictably placed the blame on \"wokeness\"-their thinly veiled rhetorical stand-in for \"Black people.\" But it didn't take long before white conservatives , apparently unable to help themselves, openly admitted what they truly meant.\n\nWall Street Journal opinion columnist Andy Kessler-even after noting SVB' s singular focus on venture capitalists and startups, overabundance of uninsured deposits, depreciated securities portfolio due to rising federal interest rates, and the tech sector's downturn-still somehow dumbly arrived at the conclusion that having \"1 Black\" and \"1 LGBTQ+\" members on its board may have indicated SVB's fatal preoccupation with \"diversity.\"\n\n\"Silicon Valley Bank donated more than $73 million to groups tied to Black Lives Matter,\" Fox Business Network host Maria Bartiromo pronounced . \"Silicon Valley Bank,\" Tucker Carlson dramatically stated during his nightly Fox white-power hour, \"spent more than $73 million on donations to BLM and related organizations.\" Former Trump adviser Stephen Miller, who now runs a white supremacist legal operation , groused about the bailout of a bank that has \"given millions of dollars in BLM initiatives.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRight-wingers being incensed about a single Black member of a 12-person board-which still makes SVB one of the country 's whitest major banks -is totally in keeping with who they are. Nothing performative about the racism on display there; anti-Blackness is their brand. It's their contention of SVB's death-by-diversity-manifest in some multimillion-dollar cash giveaway to BLM-where the faux outrage can be found.\n\nBecause not only did SVB fall short of giving $73 million to BLM, in reality, the bank never gave a single dollar to the organization.\n\nThe most telling evidence of the lie driving this racist hysteria is its origin point. The Claremont Institute may have once been the sort of conservative institution that dressed up its racism and bigotry in intellectual finery, but starting in the Trump era, it opted to change into something a bit less stuffy and more transparent for the white supremacist party.\n\nDays after SVB's failure, Newsweek published an opinion piece from the organization's Center for the American Way of Life that was filled with half-truths, lies, and right-wing racist refrains.\n\nLeaning into the conservative mantra that 2020's racial justice protests were overwhelmingly violent , the article labeled BLM's demands for anti-racism in workplaces a \"shakedown of corporate America\"-stopping just short of calling it an \"armed hold up.\" According to Claremont, American corporations, cowed and afraid, had \"pledged or contributed an astonishing $82.9 billion\" over the last three years. (They noted the figure is \"more than the GDP of 46 African countries,\" because why not drag a whole other continent of Black folks into this while you're at it, I guess.)\n\nThe authors linked to CAW's new \" BLM Funding Database ,\" which purports to reveal how much individual companies across corporate America have given \"to the Black Lives Matter movement and related causes.\"\n\nThis is where the fine print becomes fraudulent. A general search of the database for SVB's donations to \"BLM Movement & Related Causes\" produces a figure of $70,650,000-which would certainly be a staggering number, if only it were true. But getting slightly more specific in the search reveals the big lie at its core.\n\nClaremont itself admits the \"the BLM Movement\" consists of a limited number of official organizations, including the BLM PAC, BLM Grassroots, BLM At School, and any official BLM chapters, among a few other entities. Search the database for SVB donations to any of those listed groups, and it shows that not a dime has been given.\n\nThe discrepancy, it seems, can be found under the link \"Explanatory Notes,\" where Claremont explains that it defines a BLM \"'Related Cause\" as all \"organizations and initiatives that advance one or more aspects of BLM's agenda.\" That means any organization Claremont believes helps BLM's mission-which, for the record, Claremont explicitly claims is to \"undermine capitalism, the nation state, and Western civilization\"-is tagged as a \"related cause.\" To call Claremont's \"related cause\" category a stretch is to redefine the word \"understatement.\"\n\nAs Popular Information notes, an example of what Claremont tries to pass off as a \"related cause\" is Access to Innovation, \"a fellowship program\" launched by SVB itself to aid \"Black, Latinx and women professionals looking to launch their careers in venture capital.\" SVB pledged to infuse the program with $50 million over the next five years back in 2021, but with the bank's failure just two years later, there's no telling how much money was actually invested in the program.\n\nEven so, if every pledged cent made its way into the fellowship, the program would still fail to meet Claremont's own definition of a BLM-aligned cause. To quote Popular Information, \"integrating marginalized groups into the venture capitalist community seems like an odd way to 'undermine capitalism,' the purpose of BLM, according to the Claremont Institute.\"\n\nThe database also points to another $20 million SVB supposedly gave to a BLM-related causes, but then indicates those dollars supported \"COVID-19 relief,\" \"a needs-based University Scholarship program to students at four universities, including two HBCUs\" and \"economic development; and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts through 2022.\"\n\nSaranac Hale Spencer at Factcheck.org noticed Claremont's math didn't quite add up to the purported $20 million figure, and asked the institution to explain the discrepancy. Claremont responded with a boilerplate statement that neglected to answer her question.\n\nSo Spencer did some further digging and found SVB's charitable foundation donated to \"10 organizations, including a group supporting wildlife affected by the wildfires in Australia, a hospice care project and various children's organizations.\" Along with that, the foundation pledged $5 million for \"25 full undergraduate scholarships at four universities-Arizona State University, Tulane University, Florida A&M University and Xavier University of Louisiana.\" Only the last two colleges are HBCUs, and all of the scholarships were open to anyone who met established financial and academic eligibility requirements.\n\nTo recap, there's not a single BLM \"related cause\" to be found, nor any group with a demonstrated commitment to torching \"capitalism, the nation state, and Western civilization.\"\n\nWe could do this all day, as Josh Marshall at Talking Points Memo apparently did, only to find that Claremont pulled this misinformation stunt with nearly every company in its database. In the case of Bank of America, which Claremont's database links to $18 billion-yes, billion , with a \"b\"-in BLM and \"related cause\" donations. Marshall found that BOA earmarked $1.8 billion housing and business loans \"in minority communities,\" which is money that has to be paid back, likely with interest, to BOA, because that's how loans work. Marshall also noted a \"tiny fraction of that total (no specific numbers are cited) goes in grants to organizations like Asian Americans Advancing Justice , National Coalition for Asian Pacific American Community Development and The Leadership Conference Education Fund .\"\n\nI did a search under Kellogg-you know, the breakfast cereal company-which Claremont claims gave BLM and \"related causes\" a whopping $91 million. Look through the paperwork, though, and you'll find the company gave $1 million in planning funds to 10 groups, including a coalition that helps pastoralist women in Tanzania, and a U.S.-based effort that \"trains restaurants to desegregate their staff racially and raise wages for workers of color.\" Five of those groups were then selected to receive $80 million over the next eight years, including a collective working to help Indigenous South and Central Americans with land tilling and ownership; environmental legal groups in Kenya, Sierra Leone, and the U.S; an initiative to end End Youth Incarceration in Hawai'i; a group working to end racism in Brazilian schools; and Healing Through Justice, which addresses trauma and mental health issues in Black and brown kids from underserved communities in Chicago. Kellogg also gave $1 million to the NAACP-the oldest and, frankly, most establishmentarian racial equality group in the U.S.\n\nFor Claremont, providing mental wellness services to Black kids is a BLM \"related cause,\" which on its own shows how unscrupulous and dishonest the mission behind its database is.\n\nYou get the picture.\n\nFactCheck.org's Spencer calculates that, of the more than $82 billion Claremont claims corporations gave to BLM, actual \"donations to BLM groups account for about 2 percent of the total amount included in the database for all corporations.\"\n\nAmong the groups Claremont includes as \"BLM related\": the ACLU, NAACP, Urban League, United Negro College Fund, the Jackie Robinson Foundation, the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture, the Mexican-American Legal Defense Fund, Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change, The American Heart Association, YWCA, Amnesty International, YMCA, Big Brothers Big Sisters, Chinese for Affirmative Action, and the Equal Justice Institute-and I am only stopping here because otherwise we will all age into dust.\n\nMaybe the most laughable-but still dangerous-assertion Claremont makes in its Newsweek piece is that its database reveals that \"the radical Left has the means-and willingness-to realize its policy preferences in ways that bypass the democratic political process.\"\n\nWhoo boy. Let's get into this.\n\nClaremont's discussion of the left's \"means\" conveniently ignores its own funding by Donors Trust -known as the \" dark money ATM \" of the right for the anonymity of most of its backers, which it has no legal obligation to divulge, although right-wing mega-donors including the DeVoses and Kochs are on-record for being among their numbers.\n\nDonors Trust then distributes its dark money millions to the right-wing groups currently leading the charge against voting rights, trans rights, climate policy, and racial equality. It is aligned with groups like the Federalist Society, another Donors Trust grantee , whose leader, Leonard Leo, is responsible for Trump's selection of the triumvirate that completed the court's conservative supermajority, allowing Roe v. Wade to be overturned and a slew of other civil rights to now hang in the balance.\n\nFederalist Society member John Eastman, the author of the \" coup memo \" that attempted to overturn the 2020 presidential election and reinstall Donald Trump, is a senior fellow at Claremont . In fact, Eastman authored Claremont's amicus \" friend of the court \" brief in Moore v. Harper, one of the most frightening cases before this Supreme Court, because if Claremont and its allies win, Republican state legislatures will be empowered to commit all kinds of partisan chicanery in elections, and state courts will be barred from doing anything about it. (Eastman, in fact, is the guy who got the \"independent state legislature\" theory from the extremist margins to SCOTUS in the first place.)\n\nClaremont also filed an amicus brief in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, which has led to gun control laws being challenged in multiple states . Claremont has been a paid booster of Pizzagate's Jack Posobiec and anti-\"woke\" activist Christopher Rufo, who proudly boasts about creating misinformation-driven social panics around critical race theory and trans existence .\n\nClaremont's president, Ryan Williams, promotes ideas steeped in 19th-century race science , and claims \" the Constitution is really only fit for a Christian people.\" As if that's not enough, after helping promote Trump's election denialism, Claremont is now all-in with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis , helping him realize every fascistic idea he can come up with.\n\nThat's what Claremont stands for. Their attacks on BLM are really about their disdain for what they see more broadly as ungrateful Black people disrupting the American status quo.

      "text": "These Iconic Moments From the Summer of Protest Will Go Down in History\n\nSenior National Reporter\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic paralyzed the United States in 2020, forcing everyone indoors and upending the country's economy. But, in May, the nation's attention sharply jolted away from the virus after a white police officer in Minneapolis was filmed putting his knee on Black man George Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds, until he stopped breathing.\n\nAmericans burst into the streets in the millions to protest police brutality and racial injustice. The rallying cry moved beyond Floyd's death to the deaths of other Black Americans like Breonna Taylor , Ahmaud Arbery , Rayshard Brooks , Tony McDade , and Elijah McClain .\n\nAnger boiled over into anarchy, from looting in New York City and burning down police stations in Minneapolis, to Confederate statues being toppled in the South. With an estimated 15 to 26 million Americans taking part in the demonstrations over summer, experts told The New York Times that it was probably the largest movement in American history, accompanied by seismic changes in how the media, political leaders, and law enforcement approach race and justice.\n\nThese were the iconic moments in an iconic summer of protest.\n\nMinneapolis Burns\n\nAs the video of Floyd's death reverberated around the world, the city where it happened erupted. Buildings burned and state officials instituted an 8 p.m. curfew after several police precincts were set on fire.\n\nMinneapolis, May 29.\n\nAs residents kept flooding the streets, cops deployed tear gas, flashbangs, and rubber bullets, often indiscriminately at lawful protesters and journalists. The National Guard was captured on video charging into crowds. Protesters choked amid clouds of tear gas. Reporters were injured live on air.\n\nMSNBC host Ali Velshi was hit by a rubber bullet, freelance photographer Linda Tirado was blinded in one eye after being shot, a CBS News crew reported being hit with rubber bullets despite being nowhere near the crowds, and a CNN producer was struck with tear gas in scenes that anchor Don Lemon said resembled \"a war zone.\"\n\nBut the scene that stopped many Americans in their tracks was the sight of Black CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez being handcuffed on live TV while trying to report from the smoldering streets as daylight broke. A group of cops in riot gear surrounded him-even after he identified himself as a reporter and politely asked how he could best comply with their move-on orders.\n\nMinnesota police arrest CNN reporter and camera crew as they report from protests in Minneapolis https://t.co/oZdqBti776 pic.twitter.com/3QbeTjD5ed\n\nThen, in a stunning example of grace and professionalism, Jimenez calmly asked his camera crew to move as he was told he was under arrest and escorted away. He was later released from custody after public uproar reached the governor's office.\n\nA Showdown at Lafayette Square\n\nAs protests grew, President Donald Trump only inflamed the situation by referring to those exercising their First Amendment rights as thugs-even suggesting that looters should be shot. But when Trump was mocked for retreating to the White House bunker during a particularly heated night of protests, the enraged president turned tough talk into disturbingly tough action.\n\nNear the White House, June 1.\n\nIn the afternoon of June 1, police officers near the North Lawn of the White House suddenly charged at peaceful protesters , throwing tear gas and using force to aggressively disperse the docile crowd. The reason? The president wanted to walk defiantly to nearby St. John's Episcopal Church-which had been partially set on fire the weekend before-to pose for a photo with a Bible.\n\nFlanked by Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany, Attorney General Bill Barr, U.S. Army General Mark Milley and others, the stunt was a low point, even for Trump . Milley later confessed he almost quit, dismayed that the military would be drawn into domestic politics .\n\nBarr, on the other hand, personally gave the orders for Park Police to disperse protesters and then quibbled over whether tear gas or some other chemical weapon was used-just one of the countless times the Trump administration denigrated, undermined or tried to violently quell the historic protests.\n\nGoodbye Confederate Monuments\n\nIn the South, Confederate monuments toppled as the movement for racial justice swelled. Since May, more than 130 Confederate statues and tributes to slavery have gone. Several were toppled in late-night acts of vandalism or by government decrees, but at least 35 were transported to new homes by sympathizers who realized they were under threat.\n\nRichmond, Virginia, June 4.\n\nIn Montgomery, Alabama, a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee was toppled from its pedestal in front of his namesake high school . Nearby, in Birmingham, some residents tore down the monument of Charles Linn, one of Birmingham's founders and a former Confederate Navy officer.\n\nRichmond, Virginia also became a monument battleground after Gov. Ralph Northam said that a statue of Lee would be taken down-along with four others depicting Confederate figures.\n\nMilitary bases named after Confederate generals came under scrutiny, too. The Pentagon and Congress vowed to remove Confederate tributes, but Trump vetoed the annual defense spending bill in protest this month.\n\nAccording to the Southern Poverty Law Center , about 1,800 Confederate symbols are still displayed on public lands.\n\nFrom Brooklyn to Fifth Ave\n\nNew York City, an early epicenter of the coronavirus, saw some of the most dramatic scenes, from staggeringly large protests to chilling brutality to rampant looting.\n\nNew York, June 2.\n\nAn unprepared, disorganized NYPD cracked down violently on anti-police brutality protesters . One officer drove his car into a group of protesters , others bashed cyclists with batons or kettled bystanders when curfews were enacted. In one case, NYPD officer Vincent D'Andraia shoved 20-year-old Dounya Zayer to the pavement and called her a \"stupid fucking bitch\" after she'd asked why police were forcefully ordering people off the street.\n\nThis is the #BlackTransLivesMatter protest in Brooklyn right now. pic.twitter.com/rl1MrzCHEV\n\nDemonstrators took a violent turn, too. Rioters in Union Square ignited boxes outside the Strand bookstore while others lit trash cans and blew up cop cars. In Brooklyn, police vans were set on fire and, in one of the most chaotic nights of summer, hundreds of people smashed into hundreds of storefronts in midtown Manhattan for hours.\n\nSome of the most famous thoroughfares in the world, like Fifth Avenue, were overtaken by mobs smashing windows, loading up cars with loot, playing music, and lighting fires outside department stores. Designers stores in high-end neighborhoods of Soho and Chelsea were also stripped bare. The following night, there was an 8 p.m. curfew in the city that never sleeps.\n\nThe Wall of Moms\n\nThe federal government thought their decision to send unidentified, heavily armed agents into big Democrat-run cities in July would finally end the weeks of persistent protests.\n\nPortland, Oregon, July 24.\n\nPortland, however, had other ideas. The sight of anonymous agents-later revealed to be Customs and Border Protection in camouflage uniforms- shoving protesters into unmarked vans , shooting a projectile into an activist's head, and using wildly aggressive \"crowd control tactics\" only motivated more residents to come out.\n\nProtests swelled by the thousands. Among them were a group dubbed the \"Wall of Moms\"-local mothers who donned matching yellow shirts and bike helmets, and linked arms to create a wall between law enforcement and vulnerable protesters. (Behind the iconic images, the group was later accused of being anti-Black and was reborn as Moms for Black Lives Matter .)\n\nMoms sing lullaby \"hands up please don't shoot me\" pic.twitter.com/GJhj8ymn12\n\nA Slogan to Remember\n\nIt's hard to think of a catch cry more enduring from the summer of protest than \"Defund the Police\"-a slogan that became as divisive as it was misunderstood. For some activists, it was a literal demand. For others, it was a push to reform policing by diverting funds away from bloated police budgets to mental health-care and community programs instead. For right-wing actors, it became a political weapon. Trump based much of his 2020 campaign messaging on it, concocting far-fetched images of 911 calls going unanswered and non-existent antifa gangs taking over the suburbs.\n\nBack in Minneapolis, where the historic summer of protest began, it became a muddied ideal. The city council took an extraordinary stand after Floyd's death, voting unanimously to defund and disband the Minneapolis Police Department. But, months later, as crime surged in the city, council members quietly tried to walk back their grand pledge . Instead, they voted to redirect $8 million from the police budget to other services.\n\nSenior National Reporter\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

The 6,500-square-foot home has \"more than half a dozen bedrooms and bathrooms, several fireplaces, a soundstage, a pool and bungalow, and parking for more than 20 cars,\" the magazine says, quoting a real estate notice for the property. When questioned, the BLM leadership told the magazine they had \"always planned\" to disclose the purchase and that no one lives there full time. It was intended as a creative space, despite what the magazine discloses has produced \"relatively little content\" on the property. The expenditure could now call into question the group's tax-free status, even though it was purchased two months before the organization was officially awarded the status by the IRS. Either way, New York questions the secrecy of the matter. \"It creates the impression that money donated to the cause of racial justice has been spent in ways that benefit the leaders of Black Lives Matter personally,\" the author writes.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "'Atlanta' Exposes the Black Lives Matter Industrial Complex\n\nAs the episode description promises, tonight's Atlanta is sure to make some folks mad, primarily a certain Black Lives Matter activist not so subtly depicted as a non-profit leader who goes by a mononym and unironically wears a Baltic life jacket as a fashion accessory.\n\n\"White Fashion,\" written and directed by Ibra Ake-who also directed Beyonce's Black Is King -comes for a lot of necks over the course of 30 minutes, from the fashion industry, obviously, to anti-racist book authors to the whitewashed culinary world. At its most keen moments, the episode highlights the perverse symbiosis between social-justice grifters and corporations while the marginalized communities they purport to care about are left out in the cold. There's also some poking fun at the \"listening and learning\" industrial complex that hit a peak during the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests. However, the episode strangely invokes the ill-informed concept of Black buying power as a productive alternative to these corporate-driven measures and not an equally ineffectual, capitalist trick. It's primarily confusing in an episode that ends with a Nigerian restaurant owner having her business hijacked by white people.\n\nDespite some muddled messaging, the satire that works in this episode really works.\n\nAl faces a moral dilemma when he's contacted by a luxury fashion brand called Esco Esco to assist in their PR efforts following a scandal with one of their products-a jersey with the number 5 on the back sandwiched between the words \"central\" and \"park.\" We also see marketing that features a white woman modeling the jersey while lying on a picnic blanket surrounded by Black people. As a result, the brand's publicists ask Al to be a part of a press conference to announce their new diversity advisory panel but instruct him not to say anything and imply that his role is short-term. Earn is reasonably concerned that Al's involvement will look like an \"Uncle Tom\" situation. He also says that, if he were in Al's shoes, he would take the opportunity to learn about diversity programs and start his own initiative encouraging Black folks to reinvest in their own communities instead of supporting white businesses.\n\nAs I hinted at earlier, this episode's failure to interrogate Black consumerism from this angle is disappointing but not necessarily shocking for a show helmed by Donald Glover . The whole \"support Black business\" mantra that was offered as a solution to Black people being shot by police in 2020 is problematic for a number of reasons, including the studied myth that Black people could significantly change their socio-economic circumstances if only they didn't buy Nikes-but I digress! Predictably, Al scoffs at his \"Martin Luther King Ebenezer Baptist Church\" soapbox moment and says that he just wants an endless supply of free designer clothes for him and his \"hoes.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Darius's very mundane journey to attain some jollof rice in England becomes a fable about cultural appropriation and gentrification after he requests the Nigerian staple at the Esco Esco fashion house. Unsure where to buy it from, an assistant named Sharon (Tamsin Topolski) goes with Darius to a Nigerian restaurant and becomes fascinated by the food and culture, Shazam-ing the music playing from the speakers and inquiring about the term \"Naija.\" Darius doesn't make much of her ignorance about his culture as a British white woman. But her curiosity is revealed to be much more nefarious by the end of the episode when she buys the business and creates a whitewashed Nigerian food truck called Naija Bowl.\n\nBack at the racial apology press conference where a Black woman is warming up the crowd with a soulful rendition of \"Amazing Grace,\" Al meets a young, gay-coded Black man named Khalil (Fisayo Akinade) donning the aforementioned piece of swimwear over a suit. When he introduces himself to Al, he retorts in an exasperated tone that he already knows who he is, clueing us in on Khalil's celebrity-activist status. Khalil immediately makes it known that helping corporations get out of racial controversies is practically his entire job, bragging that he hasn't paid for a meal in \"73 police shootings.\" Later, he tells Al that if he wants to know what his charity does, he needs to buy his book.\n\nIt's debatable, throughout the course of the episode, whether Ake thinks the audience should loathe or respect Khalil's hustle-especially by the end-given that he's taken rightful advantage of white people's useless guilt but also perpetuating this idea that racism can be eradicated with conservative, ultimately hollow gestures of solidarity.\n\nLikewise, when the press conference begins, he informs the reporters that, under Esco Esco's new diversity efforts, they intend to end racism \"by 2024.\" Before that, a representative for the brand kicks off the event by telling the press that he is \"the least prejudiced person in the room.\" Al is obviously perturbed and attempts to answer one of the reporter's questions honestly before he's cut off by Khalil.\n\nLater, the discovery advisory panel, which includes an anti-racist book author and a social-media influencer whose Blackness is questionable, in addition to Al and Khalil, meet in a boardroom to discuss what the brand's apology gesture will entail but, first and foremost, what each person wants out of it. Khalil requests tickets to A Raisin in the Sun , which features Julia Roberts in a central role. DeMarco, the influencer, wants Nikes and business-class plane tickets. Sam, the author, wants a thousand copies of her book sold for sensitivity trainings. And they all want a hook-up to the Black Panther 2 premiere.\n\nWhen Al asks how any of that helps Black people, DeMarco, a blue-eyed, racially ambiguous fellow with a fade and a Blaccent, replies that he's Black and that it helps him personally to a bunch of curious stares. Inevitably, Al ends up taking Earn's idea from earlier, suggesting that the company launch a capsule collection along with a \"reinvest in your hood\" campaign, to which everyone is onboard.\n\nBrian Tyree Henry as Alfred \"Paper Boi\" Miles and Donald Glover as Earn Marks in Atlanta 's \"White Fashion\"\n\nMeanwhile, Earn is hanging out in a hotel lobby where he finally runs into Van reading a book. When he asks where she's been and why she hasn't been communicating with anyone, she doesn't give him much besides a shrug and smile. Out of nowhere, an angry white woman walks up to Van and accuses her of stealing a wig she bought at a store down the street. The concierge eventually kicks the woman out of the hotel and offers Earn the best room, where the two spend the night.\n\nSo far, these writers are not beating the Manic Pixie Dream Girl allegations when it comes to the hollow portrayal of Van, especially in this episode where she solely appears to have sex with Earn before vanishing into the night without any explantation of what she's doing when she's not with him. It seems that her mystifying journey/state of mind exists solely as a point of curiosity for Earn and an occasional reminder for him to enjoy life's adventures and not be so tied down by work. At this point, the gesturing toward this very noticeable trope in male-driven stories feels uncanny.\n\n\"White Fashion\" ends on an expected pessimistic note. When we see the commercial for Paper Boi's \"reinvest in your hood\" campaign, it features mostly white people of varying occupations, ages and sexual orientations telling the camera \"we're all from some hood.\" When Al confronts Khalil about his campaign essentially being \"All Lives Matter-ed,\" he responds astutely that there was no way a white-owned corporation would encourage its consumers to stop buying from them-something you'd think the typically cynical Al would understand from the jump. Khalil also suggests that Al take advantage of guilty white liberals like he does and invest in his own charity if wants to make any actual change.\n\nAt this point, you sense the show trying to give #Resistance grifters the benefit of the doubt or at least imagining a scenario in which their grifting could be subversive or even ethical. But if the egregious controversies surrounding Black Lives Matter's global and local networks and their use of funds are any evidence, they certainly haven't earned any sort of generous depiction. Overall, the episode concludes in a long, exhausted sigh.\n\nFor more, listen and subscribe to The Last Laugh podcast .\n\nkyndall.cunningham@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

In 2016, activists leading the \"Abolish the Police\" drive decided to take their organizing efforts off the internet altogether for a period of time in what became known as a \"blackout.\" In the process, they discovered something they weren't expecting.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSubscribe to The New Abnormal on Apple Podcasts , Spotify , Google Podcasts , Stitcher , Amazon Music , or Overcast .

They began to quickly realize that the people that they were in favor of abolishing the police for didn't wanna get rid of the police.

      "text": "Oprah on Black Lives Matter and George Floyd: We Are at a 'Tipping Point' for Racism in America\n\nSenior Editor, Obsessed\n\n\"What matters now? What matters next? What do we want? What are our demands? Where do we go from here?\"\n\nThese questions from Oprah Winfrey introduced OWN Spotlight: Where Do We Go From Here? , the unprecedented two-night town hall event that premiered Tuesday on OWN and across Discovery's 18 other U.S. networks. Airing the same night as the funeral for George Floyd, the Minneapolis black man whose death at the hands of a white police officer has sparked global protests, part one launched Winfrey's conversation with black thought leaders and activists including director Ava DuVernay and Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams . Together, they discuss systemic racism and the current state of America .\n\nWinfrey began the special by recalling her 35 years as a television personality interrogating these topics, beginning in 1985 when she interviewed diversity expert Jane Elliott and realized \"how little so many white people understood about racism.\"\n\n\"Over the years of the Oprah show, I did over 100 shows about racism,\" she said, recounting famous examples like her town hall in Forsyth County, Georgia , where there was an attempt to ban black people entirely, and her spotlights on civil rights heroes like the Little Rock 9 and the Freedom Riders.\n\n\"In all of those experiences, though, I don't recall a moment quite like this one,\" she continued. \"Because we find our nation on a precipice, a true tipping point, I believe. And just like all of you for the past few weeks, I've been talking and Zooming with friends, and the same question keeps popping up over and over: Is this the moment that will finally change our country, where people will recognize systemic racism for the problem and the evil that it is?\"\n\nThe conversation that ensued was impressive, specific, emotional and educational. It gave space to her panel-which also included Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, actor David Oyelowo, and journalist Charles M. Blow-to express their grief, describe the effects of generations of trauma, articulate their exhaustion, and put America's current, historic civil rights movement in context and lay out the path forward.\n\n\"We can't move forward without calling out that pain,\" Winfrey said. \"Watching the life seep from George Floyd's body caused a kind of universal shock and pain. For black people everywhere, we recognized that knee on the neck.\"\n\nLater, in a discussion of the societal numbness towards black violence, pain, and death, she returned to that idea.\n\n\"Isn't it very much like in the days of Jim Crow when black men would be lynched and dragged through the town as an example for other people to see, watching black men be shot on camera and nothing happens is a triggering thing?\" she said. \"There's this memory that we have of everything that's gone in the past, so when this keeps occurring, it is re-traumatizing.\"\n\nAttempting to define the current moment while also informing and contextualizing what is happening is a tall order, even across two nights. The panel of guests were candid, diving quickly and deeply into topics ranging from systemic racism to the effects of racial economic inequality to the responsibility of white allies and how to harness the energy of the current moment.\n\n\"Where white Americans have often viewed these as individual incidents, black Americans understand that this is part of a collective history,\" Nikole Hannah-Jones, Pulitzer prize-winning founder of the New York Times magazine's \"1619 Project\" said. \"The weariness that it has to take something so horrifying for white Americans to decide that they can't tolerate it anymore... We're just tired as black people of having to prove our humanity only when the most inhumane thing happens to us.\"\n\nOne of the most moving moments came early, when Oyelowo talked about why watching the footage of Floyd's death affected him to the point that he posted a video explaining his reaction.\n\n\"I had made the mistake of thinking that things would be different for my son,\" he said. \"I say mistake because I had watched things progress in some ways, but then the knee on the neck is so symbolic of so much. It's something that I hadn't realized that I had internalized in a way that makes it difficult for me to function. I hadn't realized how deep the wounds were.\"\n\nAs he went to go talk to his son about it, he was stalled by the fact that Floyd wasn't resisting arrest. It's not the same conversation he, and so many black parents, have had to have with their children. \"Those conversations are already emasculating, to basically say, 'Forget about justice in an interaction with police. Come home alive.'\"\n\nOne point was driven home repeatedly: at the root of everything happening now-from the violence to the marches to the conversations-is a systemic issue of power.\n\n\"It's not a broken system,\" DuVernay stressed. \"It was built this way. It was built to function exactly as it is. I feel it's disingenuous as a society to act as if we're suddenly horrified when everyone has participated in this and benefited from it not for years or decades, but centuries. Generations.\"\n\nThe grief and the anger has been the same. The discussions have been the same. And the responsibility to guide white people through all of it has been the same. Part of where we go from here is to relieve that burden.\n\n\"So much of those conversations have centered on educating Caucasian people through the trauma, walking them through what it is, making sure they feel and sustain that outrage,\" DuVernay said. While that has a place and is valuable, she's realized that \"my own work [is] to break out of a constant education of folks, and to really ask white folks who feel deeply about this issue to take on that labor for themselves.\"\n\nOf what to make of this moment, DuVernay warned against being sidetracked by the conflation of protesting, rioting, and looting in the media.\n\n\"If your concern with the murder of black people by police can be deterred or shifted because someone is taking a pair of jeans from a Target, then you've got to look at how much you cared about the murder of black people by police to begin with,\" she said. \"Watch yourself as you're playing this game of respectability politics because you're getting to a place that is really veering way off the path of what the point at hand is, which starts from a place of the murder of black people by police and really opens up to an interrogation of a whole system.\"\n\nThe \"whole system\" is the point, participants repeatedly emphasized. It drove home why the question of \"where do we go from here?\" is such a lofty one. It's not just about the police. It's about the systems and institutions they subsist on.\n\n\"If we believe this is an inflection point, then we actually have to do things to upend these structures,\" said Color of Change president Rashad Robinson, decrying that far too often we get to a place of news coverage, social activation, and cultural energy but don't manifest anything from it. \"We mistake all of that visibility for actually getting to the place where both the written and unwritten change.\"\n\nMore footage and talking points from night one of Where Do We Go From Here? -and there's so much more to unpack-is available to stream on the Watch OWN and Discovery Family's TVE apps, as well as OWN's Instagram, Facebook, and YouTube channels. Part two airs Wednesday at 9 pm ET/PT.\n\nSenior Editor, Obsessed\n\nkevin.fallon@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

He describes how athletes are forcing a reckoning about systemic racism in professional sports, including in NASCAR , which has rallied around the sole Black driver competing in the Cup Series, Bubba Wallace, who led a push to ban Confederate flags from races. \"It's amazing what's happening in NASCAR ,\" Thomas says. \"They did more in 48 hours than the NFL did for Colin Kaepernick for four or five years.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González, as we turn to look at the fight for racial justice in sports. The FBI said Tuesday NASCAR driver Bubba Wallace was not the target of a hate crime and that a noose found in his garage had been there since last year. NASCAR described the item as a, quote, \"garage door pull rope fashioned like a noose\" and says it had been there for months before the stall was assigned to Wallace. NASCAR launched an investigation after a crew member discovered the noose Sunday at the Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama. Bubba Wallace, who is the only African American driver in NASCAR's elite Cup Series, tweeted the, quote, \"act of racism and hatred leaves me incredibly saddened.\" On Tuesday night, he told CNN he stands by what he said.\n\nBUBBA WALLACE : The image that I have and I have seen of what was hanging in my garage is not a - is not a garage pull. I've been racing all my life. We've raced out of hundreds of garages, that never had garage pulls like that. So, people that want to call it a garage pull and put out old videos and photos of knots being in their - as their evidence, go ahead. But from the evidence that we have and that I have, it's a straight-up noose. The FBI has stated it was a noose over and over again.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, that's Bubba Wallace. On Sunday, a plane circled over the track at the Talladega Superspeedway towing a Confederate flag and a banner reading \"Defund NASCAR ,\" to push back against the decision of NASCAR to ban the Confederate flag at its raceways.\n\nMeanwhile, Dustin Skinner, the son of former NASCAR driver Mike Skinner, apologized Tuesday for writing a Facebook post saying that Bubba Wallace should be dragged around the pits with the noose.\n\nWell, from NASCAR to NFL , where Commissioner Roger Goodell now says he encourages teams to sign quarterback Colin Kaepernick, we're joined by Etan Thomas, athlete and activist, who spent 11 years in the NBA , co-host of the weekly podcast The Collision: Where Sports and Politics Collide , with Dave Zirin. His latest book, We Matter: Athletes and Activism .\n\nIt's great to have you with us, Etan. Let's start with what's going on in NASCAR . Absolutely astounding what Bubba Wallace has accomplished, pushing hard for the Confederate flag to be banned from the raceways, and NASCAR finally did comply, and to see, before the FBI said they discovered that this noose-like rope had been there for months, all of the elite car drivers - Bubba Wallace is the only African American elite NASCAR car driver - walking with him in a Black Lives Matter-like protest. And, of course, right before that, Bubba Wallace had unveiled his racing car, which was black with bold white letters, \"Black Lives Matter,\" and he wore a T-shirt that said \"I can't breathe.\" Talk about what's happening in NASCAR .\n\nETAN THOMAS : I mean, I think - first of all, thanks for having me on.\n\nAnd I think it's amazing, what's happening in NASCAR , to be honest with you. I had a chance to interview Brad Daugherty, who is a team owner in NASCAR , a former NBA player, yesterday for another show that I have, Center of Attention on Twitch. And he told me about the culture of NASCAR . And I have to - admittedly, no, I'm not an avid watcher of NASCAR . I don't watch NASCAR all the time. But he talked about how all of the different drivers rallied around Bubba Wallace, and that show of solidarity, and how he said that, in his words, \"that wouldn't have happened 20 years ago.\"\n\nNow, getting all to the particulars of the noose, and the FBI have called it a noose many times. They didn't say that it wasn't a noose. They didn't say - well, they called it a noose, just to make that clear, no matter when it was placed there. And why Bubba Wallace was given that particular garage, you know, I don't know. But they did call it a noose.\n\nBut the part that was really impressive to me is, number one, the way that NASCAR immediately rallied around Bubba Wallace. They did more in 48 hours than the NFL did for Colin Kaepernick for four or five years, or however long it's been. But the show of solidarity around NASCAR , around the drivers - you know, which is different than the fans. So the fans had one reaction. You saw a lot of it - I mean, I've even seen it in Twitter mentions. I posted my support for Bubba Wallace, and I just saw the mentions after me. Like, there's a certain demographic that is in NASCAR , and that's undeniable. But the drivers don't match that demographic. And that's one thing that I didn't know. I just thought all the - you know, I thought they were one and the same.\n\nBut the show of solidarity is something that we're seeing all across the country, I think, what we saw in NASCAR with that. Right now at this time, since George Floyd's murder, I've seen more white people who have been protesting, who have been rallying around as allies, who want to be allies, than I have ever seen in my lifetime, to be honest with you. And, you know, we can't worry about where were you, where have you been all this time. You know, like, you're late to the party. OK, that's fine. We don't have to worry about that. But you're here now. So now is time for you to use your privilege to be able to push for things to actually change. And I think that's a reflection of where we are in the society. And those drivers in NASCAR , they are pushing for the culture of NASCAR to change.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Etan Thomas, I wanted to ask you about the other sports. Obviously, Major League Baseball is trying to salvage its season. The NFL is in a quandary about what to do. And the NBA now is seeking to restart, to get into the playoffs, but there are battles between the players themselves.\n\nETAN THOMAS : Right.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Brooklyn Nets star Kyrie Irving recently posted on his Instagram account, \"It's clear White Supremacy and Corporations use us Native Indigenous Black Folk when it is beneficial for their agenda and pockets, so be aware of the truth in plain sight.\" So, Kyrie is at least saying that the players should consider not participating, while LeBron James, obviously the biggest star in the NBA and probably in American sports, is saying, \"No, let's play and make our statements through our playing.\" I'm wondering your perspective on the battle among the NBA players about the way forward.\n\nETAN THOMAS : I don't see that it has to be a battle. I think there's two different approaches to be able to reach one common goal. We're going back to the '68 Olympics, and I had the chance to be able to interview both John Carlos and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in my book, We Matter: Athletes and Activism , and we talked about this very topic. And Kareem Abdul-Jabbar elected not to go to the '68 Olympics. He didn't go. And John Carlos, of course, went to the '68 Olympics and did the Black Power salute during the - on the podium, and that reverberated to even today. Now, both of them deserve respect.\n\nAnd that's my issue with how - and my approach to hearing Kyrie and hearing LeBron. When I turn on the news and I'm looking at Stephen A. Smith and Charles Barkley and even Michael Wilbon, and the inflammatory language that they use when describing Kyrie and Dwight Howard and Avery Bradley, who have said that maybe this isn't the best time for us to be worrying about basketball, maybe there's other things that are - a movement that is going on right now that we should be focused on, and the words that they chose to use, like \"stupid\" and \"dumb\" and \"ridiculous\" and - I would ask Stephen A. Smith, \"Would you call Kareem Abdul-Jabbar foolish for not going to the '68 Olympics?\" I don't think that's - there's room for both discussions. There's room for a civil debate in both of these approaches.\n\nNow, on one hand, we have precedent. We have the WNBA , who did go, and they went to their - as an entire league a few years ago, and I was able to interview Swin Cash and Tamika Catchings about it in my book.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is the women's league.\n\nETAN THOMAS : And what they did - what's that?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The women's league.\n\nETAN THOMAS : The women's league, yeah, the WNBA . And what they did a few years ago, after the back-to-back murders of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling, was they, as an entire league, made a statement. So, every single game, what they did was they had an actual media blackout. So they would answer like two questions from the game, and then, after that, every question would be dealing with what the topic was right there, which was police brutality and the police accountability and what they could do to change things. And they had the entire league. They had white players, foreign players that ain't even from here. They didn't even know what was going on. But they educated them on it, and they saw their sisters that were hurting, and they did it together. Yes, that's one approach.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Etan, I wanted to get your comment on the NBA Commissioner Adam Silver speaking about the league's responsibility in addressing racial inequality.\n\nADAM SILVER : The NBA can have a - almost an unparalleled voice in this conversation because of what we stand for, because we represent, frankly - I mean, when you think about our players, some of the best-known Black people in the entire world are part of the NBA and now part of the WNBA . So we know we can have a very important voice. ... Let's make sure that in returning to basketball, a larger, broader message about social equality, racial issues are not somehow lost in the discussion.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That's the NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. I was wondering what you think has to happen right now. He was talking alongside Magic Johnson in a virtual conversation. And then we'll move on to the NFL , very quickly.\n\nETAN THOMAS : Well, I think that that's just a reflection of who he is. He is very different than his predecessor. And people have to always remember, his predecessor - under his predecessor, David Stern, you know, Craig Hodges and Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf were whiteballed from the league. So he is very different. And I had a - I'm not just name dropping, but I interviewed him for my book, as well. And I have another interview that I had of Adam Silver, as well. And I asked him, you know, \"Would you punish someone who took a stand for something that you disagree with?\" And he said, \"No.\" I asked him if he would punish Craig Hodges and Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf under his watch, and he said no. So he is somebody who has said over and over again that he appreciates the athlete voice.\n\nNow, Roger Goodell is different. And we could go right and pivot right to Roger Goodell, because, all before, he said one thing. Now, now he's trying to kind of slowly turn over a new leaf. And he first made the press conference to say now he wants to embrace NFL players protesting and using their voices, but he left out Colin Kaepernick's name, which you can't really do without, you know, mentioning the one person who you whiteballed from the league, you know, for doing exactly what you're saying that you're apologizing for now. But then he tried to come back with this, and he wants to encourage teams. I don't know if it's little - you know, too little, too late for all of that, you know, too little, too late type of a thing. But, again, we can't worry about when people get there. If he's finally noticed it, if he's finally woken up, and he's finally said, \"OK, I was wrong, and I want to change my ways,\" OK. Now let's see you put action to that. It's OK to say that, use the words and use statements and things of that nature, but now you have to put action by it. And so, I have to see real, actionable policy change in the way that he conducts it. And first, it has to be with bringing back Colin Kaepernick, because he is the symbol of you trying to squash the athlete voice. It's not just about one person. It's about what you whiteballing the one person means to the entire culture.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, Etan, I want to thank you so much for being with us and end with the words of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, who wrote in the Los Angeles Times , \"Racism in America is like dust in the air. It seems invisible - even if you're choking on it - until you let the sun in. Then you see it's everywhere. As long as we keep shining that light, we have a chance of cleaning it wherever it lands. But we have to stay vigilant, because it's always still in the air.\" Those are the words of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the basketball legend. Etan Thomas, I want to thank you so much for being with us. The podcast that you started, again, is started on WPFW , the Pacifica station in Washington, D.C.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "You turn to us for voices you won't hear anywhere else.\n\nSign up for Democracy Now!'s Daily Digest to get our latest headlines and stories delivered to your inbox every day.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was elected with massive support from people of color, and in his second week in office he issued four executive orders to advance what the White House calls his \"racial equity\" agenda. The orders aim to strengthen anti-discrimination policies in housing, end Justice Department contracts with private prison companies, reaffirm sovereignty of Native American tribes and combat xenophobia against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Biden's racial justice push comes as COVID -19 has devastated communities of color in the U.S., who are experiencing higher rates of infection, death and unemployment during the pandemic. Ash-Lee Woodard Henderson, co-executive director of the Highlander Research and Education Center, says Biden's executive orders are \"a step forward\" and credits social movements who have been pressuring the administration to act. \"This is not just because of his good graces,\" Henderson says. \"This is because movement made it possible that racial equity be something that is prioritized in the executive branch of our government.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : After winning office with massive support from people of color, President Joe Biden moved Tuesday to advance what the White House calls his \"racial equity\" agenda.\n\nPRESIDENT JOE BIDEN : We need to open the promise of America to every American. And that means we need to make the issue of racial equity not just an issue for any one department of government; it has to be the business of the whole of government.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Biden opened his speech by invoking the legacy of George Floyd, the African American man whose death under the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer prompted nationwide protests against racism. He announced four executive actions.\n\nPRESIDENT JOE BIDEN : Today, I'm directing the Department of Housing and Urban Affairs and Urban Development to redress the historical racism in federal housing policies.\n\nToday, I'm directing the federal agency to reinvigorate the consultation process with Indian tribes. Respect to tribal sovereignty - respect for tribal sovereignty will be a cornerstone of our engaging with Native American communities. ...\n\nToday, I'm directing federal agencies to combat resurgence of xenophobia, particularly against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, that we've seen skyrocket during this pandemic. ... I've also asked the Department of Health and Human Services to put out best practices for preventing xenophobia in our national response to COVID . ...\n\nI'm rescinding the previous administration's harmful ban on diversity and sensitivity training, and abolish the offensive, counterfactual 1776 Commission. Unity and healing must begin with understanding and truth, not ignorance and lies.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Many civil rights groups welcomed Biden's executive orders. Alicia Garza of Black to the Future Action Fund called the orders, quote, \"a floor to set and not the ceiling.\"\n\nAs a senator, Biden authored the 1994 crime bill, which intensified mass incarceration, disproportionately targeting Black and Brown communities, but he expressed regret for his past policies on the campaign trail after intense scrutiny and pressure. On Tuesday, Biden also ordered the Justice Department to halt its use of private prisons run by the Department of Justice.\n\nPRESIDENT JOE BIDEN : The executive order directs the attorney general to decline to renew contracts with privately operated criminal facilities, a step we started to take at the end of the Obama administration and was reversed under the previous administration. This is the first step to stop corporations from profiting off of incarceration that is less humane and less safe, as the studies show. And it is just the beginning of my administration's plan to address systemic problems in our criminal justice system.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The order will impact about 9% of the federal prison population. President Biden made no mention of ending contacts with privately run immigrant prisons that jail the majority of people for Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nSome criminal justice activists argue private prisons increase incarceration rates. But leading prison abolition scholar Ruth Wilson Gilmore writes focusing on private prisons is how, quote, \"the new 'new realists' achieve their dominance by defining the problem as narrowly as possible in order to produce solutions that on closer examination will change little,\" she said.\n\nBiden's push to advance a racial equity agenda comes as COVID has devastated communities of color. It will be led by Domestic Policy Council director Susan Rice, the former U.N. ambassador and Obama-era national security adviser. She also spoke Tuesday.\n\nSUSAN RICE : Americans of color are being infected by and dying from COVID -19 at higher rates. One in 10 Black Americans and one in 11 Latino workers are currently unemployed. By some estimates, 40% of Black-owned businesses have been forced to close for good during the COVID crisis. Black and Latino families with children are twice as likely to be experiencing food insecurity during the pandemic as white families. And Black and Latino Americans are 2.8 times more likely to die of COVID -19.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : All of this comes as the Biden administration has vowed to treat white supremacist violence as a national security threat.\n\nFor more, we're joined by Ash-Lee Woodard Henderson, co-executive director of the Highlander Research and Education Center, which has long pursued a racial equity agenda. It was founded in 1932 to provide education and support to poor and working people fighting economic injustice, poverty, prejudice and environmental destruction. Many civil rights activists passed through Highlander's grounds, including Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr., as well as Stokely Carmichael. In 2019, one of the Highlander Center's buildings was destroyed in a fire that was investigated as a possible arson and hate crime, after a white power symbol was found spray-painted in the center's parking lot. The symbol is frequently used by white power groups and was painted on one of the guns used by the mosque shooter in Christchurch, New Zealand, a month earlier. Ash-Lee Woodard Henderson is also an organizer with the Movement for Black Lives and The Frontline.\n\nWelcome back to Democracy Now! It's great to have you with us, Ash-Lee. If you can start off by responding to this racial equity agenda that President Biden has put forth in the midst of this investigation into the worst white supremacist violence at the Capitol now?\n\nASH - LEE WOODARD HENDERSON : Absolutely. And thanks for welcoming me back, Amy and Juan. It's good to see you all.\n\nSo, I think, as my sister Alicia Garza said, that this is a step forward. It's a progressive step. And we're grateful. But I want to start before the executive orders, to talk a little bit about how we got here, because although Joe Biden is using executive power to make this next shift, to take this step towards racial equity, he's not just doing it because he's a good person. He's doing it because everyday people, like many of the folks that are watching this show, got into the streets and have been making demands for generations now around racial equity. His even being in the position of president of the United States is due to the fact that those of us who are part of the largest social movement in U.S. history not only put our feet to the pavement, but also put our feet to the pavement to make sure that we can win the presidential election and get rid of Trumpism up and down the ballot. And so, this is not just because of his good graces. This is because movement made it possible that racial equity be something that is prioritized in the executive branch of our government.\n\nSo, you know, these executive orders are a step in the right direction, but they absolutely do not fully meet the demands of our movement. It is just a floor, not a ceiling. You know, the brutality and racism of prisons in this country are clearly recorded, right? And just getting rid of this one piece of the prison-industrial complex is not going to stop the brutality and the militarization of our communities. It's absolutely time for us to stop this sort of punishment bureaucracy that's been encouraged by our government, and it's just tearing our families and our communities apart. So, this is a step towards that, but, as our comrades in the immigration movement, as our folks that are fighting against police brutality and prisons and militarized forces of all stripes, we know this is just a step in that direction.\n\nThe housing executive order, critical, right? It's definitely an important step. But this country is experiencing unprecedented housing crisis - right? - where Black women, in particular, are most likely to lose their homes during stay-at-home orders across the nation, right? We know that according to the data, that Black women are twice as likely to be behind in their rent as white people, because of the economic conditions that they've inherited in this country, and have historically faced evictions at twice the rate of white people in at least 17 states in our country. A nationwide eviction moratorium was necessary. This executive order is necessary. But what's real is, we need to see cancellation of rent across this country, right? We need to see the cancellation of student debt. We need to see, like, defunding policing, whether that's federal police, Capitol Police, whether that's ICE and Border Patrol, right? We're talking about all of it. We're demanding what we deserve, not just what we concede to.\n\nAnd so, we're excited to see these first steps, sure. It's something to celebrate because movement made that possible. It's a people's victory. But we also need to continue to put pressure, political pressure, on the powers that be, both in the executive branch but also in the new Congress, in the legislative branch, to say that we deserve even more. Right? And we need even more from them. We expect them to be champions of our demands, because there's so much more to do. We need to pass the BREATHE Act, right? We need to pass the THRIVE Agenda. We need to pass the Green New Deal and see a real transformed country that changes the material conditions of our people, because we put them in office to do that.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, Ash-Lee, I wanted to ask you, in terms of - an aspect of the president's executive is this requirement that every federal agency produce within a hundred days a report on what their particular agency can do to advance equity, racial equity, across the country. I'm thinking this, especially in terms of the issue of systemic change, if that's possible under a Biden administration - and many people question that - but in terms of systemic change, I'm thinking of agencies like the Agriculture Department, the Energy Department, the Small Business Administration, even the Securities and Exchange Commission. Agencies that normally don't get much attention in terms of racial equity, now they're going to have to examine and produce a report within a hundred days of what can be done to advance it. Do you see the potential for the movement to begin putting pressure on these agencies in terms of the kinds of reports they're going to produce?\n\nASH - LEE WOODARD HENDERSON : Absolutely. But I think we also need to be real that a report does not immediately promise equity - right? - that equity is a doing thing, and that just creating space for more access and for more conversation does not necessarily mean that we will get the kind of equity that we've been demanding, right? It's who is representing our people in those conversations, what are they demanding of those departments, and how is that translating from reports into direct policy changes.\n\nAnd I think that is the hesitancy that a lot of people in social movements across this country and across the world really have, is that we don't just want to investigate and ask questions, though that is a critical part of the process of getting to equity; we also want to see, like, actual policy change, and not only that policy change, but we want to see people in elected and appointed positions in our government be held accountable to actually implementation of the recommendations that come from those bodies in those reports, right? If we don't see a level of accountability to the actual implementation of policy change, then we will have more information about the disproportionate impact of discrimination and systemic oppression in this country through different departments and different issue areas in our communities, but we won't see the transformation of those conditions.\n\nAnd I think that is the great hesitancy, which is why, again, it's really critically important that our movements not, like, lean back and take away pressure in assuming that we can just take a break and accept that this new administration is in and that they'll save us. We were not voting to elect saviors. We were voting to control our conditions and to elect our next target, to push for the most transformational change that we can get. And I think that that's going to be our responsibility, to pay attention to what comes out of these reports, but also to push them to take the next step of actually actualizing what transformative policy could be in practice.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And the issue of the president saying that the Justice Department should cease using private facilities for criminal detainees, but not necessarily for civil detainees, which would include most of those on immigration charges, your sense of what can be done to increase the pressure on the president to end the private use of detention facilities for immigration purposes?\n\nASH - LEE WOODARD HENDERSON : Absolutely. I mean, I think it's why we need a multiracial, multisector, working-class-rooted united front, that really came together to fight to get the 45th president of the United States out of office and usher in this new administration. It's even more important for us to continue to put pressure across our issue areas around this. You know, I think people think about immigration reform as just like a single sector, a single, siloed issue, when actually it's connected to the fight for racial justice. It's connected to the fight for economic and worker justice. It's connected to this fight for all of our people to have collective liberation.\n\nAnd so, I think we need to be following the leadership of folks like Greisa Martínez Rosas in United We Dream and Mijente and so many other incredible immigrant rights organizations, We Dream in Black. You know, I think about all of the incredible - UndocuBlack - all the incredible immigrant justice organizing that's happening - Women Watch Afrika and so many others - that are actually at the forefront of this frontline for immigration justice, and to recognize that when we're talking about the crisis of the new Jim Crow and mass incarceration, when we're talking about policing and militarization, and when we're talking about immigrant justice, that these fights are intimately linked, they are definitely connected, and that we will all be in this fight demanding all of these things together - right? - that we are building a movement big enough not to be piecemealed, and that until all of us are free, none of us are free.\n\nAnd so, we'll be fighting to make sure that when we talk about - when the Movement for Black Lives talks about defunding police, that we're talking about all police, including ICE and Customs and Border Patrol; when we talk about abolishing prisons, that we're talking about all of them, including detention centers; and when we're talking about Black Lives Matter, we're talking about all Black lives, including those of our people that are in this country without papers.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Ash-Lee, we're talking to you in Chattanooga, Tennessee. In 2019, one of Highlander Center's buildings was destroyed in a fire. Authorities investigated the incident as a possible arson and hate crime after a white power symbol was found spray-painted in the parking lot, the symbol frequently used by white power groups painted on one of the guns used by the mosque shooter in Christchurch, New Zealand, a month earlier. And I was wondering if you can talk about how that was dealt with, and what you're seeing right now in Washington, D.C., with the Republicans, who so decried the Black Lives Matter protests, with the number, the hundreds of Black Lives Matter activists that were arrested - nowhere near that number has been arrested for the January 6th attack on the Capitol, the Confederate flag brought into the Capitol, the ransacking of offices. If you can talk about both?\n\nASH - LEE WOODARD HENDERSON : Yeah. I think this is a really important and critical question, Amy, so thank you for it. I think the first thought that I had on January 6th was, \"Well, I wish that folks had listened to us,\" because, again, this arson at the Highlander Center happened in 2019, before we were in the throes of the electoral cycle, right? This was at a time where Black churches all across the South are being set on fire by white supremacists, right? It wasn't an attack that happened in isolation. This is when mosques and synagogues were being attacked by white supremacist nationalists and paramilitary forces. This was not an isolated issue, right?\n\nWe had been screaming to the rafters that we were the canary in the coal mine, that white supremacist violence was increasing, that we were seeing organizations building power related to white supremacy and white nationalism, and not even just in the South, right? I think of our colleagues with the Western States Center and Political Research Associates and colleagues in the Midwest and the Pacific Northwest, who have been saying that white people that felt isolated, folks that were proponents of right-wing populism, were looking for places of belonging, and they were creating them, or they were joining organizations like the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers, the Three Percenters, right? We've been saying this for a very long time.\n\nSo, when Charlottesville happens and then the attack on Highlander happens and then the bombing in Nashville happens on Christmas Day, it felt like an escalation was happening - right? - that we could see on social media, clear as day, that folks were planning to go to this protest in D.C. on the 6th, that we could be seeing that. And that the federal government and folks that are literally paid to do a job to pay attention to harm that is happening in our country were not at the helm to ensure that it didn't happen was quite frustrating.\n\nYou know, I think to compare what happened on January 6th to what happened to us in March of 2019, we haven't heard any updates about that investigation or gotten any more questions about what happened to us from the investigative bodies since August of 2019. So, my expectations for a thorough investigation of this are only optimistic because of the power of our movements to demand it. Right? If we just leave it to the powers that be to do the right thing, I fear that, similarly to the Highlander investigation, that this will just tarry on and on and on with no conclusion.\n\nAnd I think it's critical that the demands of the frontline really be executed - right? - that Donald Trump actually see his day in front of the Senate - right? - and that they finish the impeachment process. I think it's going to be critical that we demand investigation and the expulsion of each member of Congress who fanned the flames of white and male supremacist violence and voted against the certification of the election results, and, even more, that we transform this country by investing in our communities, in healthy, sustainable and equitable communities, and investing in the planet, as opposed to institutions and policies that harm our people and our planet. We have to -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Ash-Lee Woodard Henderson, we want to thank you so much for being with us, co-executive director of the Highlander Research and Education Center, organizer with the Movement for Black Lives and The Frontline, speaking to us from Chattanooga, Tennessee.\n\nNext up, today is Climate Day at the White House. A number of executive orders are being signed. We'll speak to Varshini Prakash of the Sunrise Movement. Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Organizers have called on the City Council to enact a People's Budget that slashes money for police and invests in services for the community instead. \"We have created a system that overrelies on law enforcement and prioritizes their money, their budget, their needs over everything else,\" says Patrisse Cullors, co-founder of Black Lives Matter, and Reform L.A. Jails. \"Now is the time that we redirect resources back into our communities.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The Quarantine Report . I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González, as we go now to Los Angeles, where protesters took to the streets of downtown and Hollywood on Monday, another day of mass protests against police brutality and the murder of George Floyd. Demonstrators briefly shut down the 405 Freeway in West L.A. In Van Nuys, looting broke out near a peaceful protest organized by students.\n\nMonday marked the third night of a countywide curfew in Los Angeles, where protests have been widespread and resulted in thousands of arrests. The wealthy enclaves of Beverly Hills and Santa Monica set 1 p.m. curfews after protests reached their neighborhoods. On Sunday, hundreds were arrested in a mass protest in Santa Monica that left many storefronts destroyed.\n\nCalls are growing for the firing of the LAPD chief, Michel Moore, who said Monday that looters were as responsible for George Floyd's death as the police officers who killed him.\n\nPOLICE CHIEF MICHEL MOORE : We didn't have protests last night; we had criminal acts. We didn't have people mourning the death of this man, George Floyd; we had people capitalizing. His death is on their hands as much as it is those officers.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The Los Angeles Police Chief Michel Moore has since apologized for his statements. Mayor Eric Garcetti tweeted, \"The responsibility for George Floyd's death rests solely with the police officers involved. Chief Moore regrets the words he chose this evening and has clarified them.\"\n\nThis comes as Mayor Garcetti is facing criticism for increasing funding for the Los Angeles Police Department in a budget for the coming fiscal year. Community members are demanding the City Council act to enact a People's Budget that slashes money for police and invests in services for the community instead.\n\nWell, for more, we're going to Los Angeles, where we're joined by Patrisse Cullors, political strategist, co-founder of Black Lives Matter, founder of Reform L.A. Jails. She's the co-author of When They Call You a Terrorist: A Black Lives Matter Memoir .\n\nWelcome back to Democracy Now! , Patrisse. It's great to have you with us. Can you respond first to the death of George Floyd and then to the massive anti-police-brutality protests and the police response?\n\nPATRISSE CULLORS : Sure. It's really good to be here, Amy, and thank you so much for having me on.\n\nI think, you know, I just start with my deep condolences to George Floyd's family and the community of Minneapolis. Once again, we see the devastation and the impact of the killing and torture of Black communities. And so, I just want to start there.\n\nI think these protests are massive in a way that we haven't seen them in years, for a number of reasons. Number one, we've had to live under four years of a Trump regime that has completely devastated communities financially, spiritually, emotionally. And number two, we have still dealt with years of police brutality, police violence and police terror, with no accountability whatsoever. And this generation is tired. Enough is enough.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Patrisse Cullors, you recently went back and watched some footage of the 1992 Rodney King uprising. What struck you the most about those events?\n\nPATRISSE CULLORS : Well, I think it's - you know, there's two things happening in our city right now, in Los Angeles. One is massive protest in solidarity with Minneapolis, but also talking about what's happening in our own town. There's been 601 deaths since 2012, involved specifically with police officers killing civilians. And we have had a DA here, Jackie Lacey, who has not prosecuted a single officer and has been largely unaccountable to the community. And as Amy said earlier, 54% of L.A. city's budget is actually LAPD's budget. And the community is over false promises. We're over having to deal with elected officials who, instead of listening to Black pain and grief, send out the National Guard, you know, create more havoc in our communities.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Patrisse Cullors, can you talk about the budget that has just been unveiled, and what you're demanding, where you think money needs to be spent at this point, and also where you see these protests going?\n\nPATRISSE CULLORS : Sure. Our local chapter, Black Lives Matter Los Angeles, led by Melina Abdullah, really has been the group that has been focusing on the city budget specifically. For years, we have seen the unveiling of a city budget, and it has always prioritized LAPD's money first, and it's deprioritized everything else, all the social services that our communities need.\n\nSo, what we're asking for is a slashing of LAPD's budget. We don't believe that LAPD needs that much money. Really, the national demand, as you'll see, is a defunding of law enforcement. Minneapolis is calling for it. Los Angeles is calling for it. Chicago is calling for it. D.C. is calling for it. We have created a system that overrelies on law enforcement and prioritizes their money, their budget, their needs over everything else. Now is the time that we redirect resources back into our communities.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Patrisse Cullors, I'm wondering - the response of the police in many of these cities now, we're seeing increasing aggressive moves by police, whether it's in New York or in Louisville or in other cities, against peaceful demonstrators. To what extent do you feel that the police across the country, many of them, have been emboldened by the language and the demeanor of President Trump over these last four years, that they feel that they have basically the backing of the White House, if they have to -\n\nPATRISSE CULLORS : Absolutely.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: - exert much more authoritarian force in their local cities?\n\nPATRISSE CULLORS : Absolutely. I mean, we know Trump's history. We know how he has impacted just by way of how he communicates, just how he uses the media to stoke fear in mostly white, affluent communities. He's aligned himself historically with the police, being law and order. He just went on the news yesterday telling people that he's going to send the military into cities. This is a man who would encourage people being beat up, counterprotesters that would come into his rallies when he was running for president. This is the man who told law enforcement at a huge law enforcement conference that they should be beating up people. And we know that he is in complete agreement with law enforcement terrorizing and using aggressive tactics like rubber bullets, like tear gas.\n\nOn Saturday, at our protest that we launched, Black Lives Matter Los Angeles, along with Build Power, for two hours, it was full of passion, full of love, and we marched together. The minute that march got violent is when the police showed up. They started shooting into the crowd rubber bullets. They started batoning people. It was disturbing, and it was scary. And it was so obvious that they feel emboldened right now.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : How do you respond, Patrisse, to police officers showing solidarity with the protesters? On Monday, you have one of New York City's top officers, Terence Monahan, taking a knee, hugging a protester during a rally in Washington Square Park. In Flint, Michigan, the Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson marched with protesters on Saturday. In Green Bay, Wisconsin, Police Chief Andrew Smith condemned the killing of George Floyd and walked with protesters. And we're seeing this amidst the tear-gassing, amidst the shooting, amidst the pepper-spraying and the massive number of thousands of arrests. Your comments?\n\nPATRISSE CULLORS : It's like a really frightening abusive relationship. It's when you're in an abusive relationship, and the partner is gaslighting you and telling you that \"Everything that you're feeling is not true, and look what I'm doing for you.\" It's not acceptable behavior, honestly. You're either going to be in solidarity with the community and stop brutalizing us, or you're going to continue to do what you've been doing and business as usual. But there's no half-stepping.\n\nTaking a knee, marching with protesters, that doesn't actually change the structure, doesn't change our system that we live in, which is a system that continues to violate the rights of Black people, continues to kill Black people, hunt Black people and traumatize Black people. That's what law enforcement has done for years. And these new acts of solidarity are - they don't sit well with many of us.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Let me ask you - we talked to you about the film Bedlam , which very much focused on you, Patrisse, and your brother Monte. So, all of these mass protests are taking place amidst the pandemic. They could be super-spreading events, the horror of what could happen, and particularly impacting Black and Latino and Native American communities. And I'm wondering, actually, what has happened with your brother Monte, who lives with schizoaffective disorder since he was a teenager, in the midst of all this - the pandemic, the police brutality protests.\n\nPATRISSE CULLORS : Well, we were lucky enough to get Monte off the streets last fall. And he was hospitalized for quite a bit of time, as I received conservatorship of him. And he ended up going to a mental health facility, so that's where he's at now. The facility has not experienced a COVID -19 outbreak, although there has been some COVID -19 patients. He is doing well right now, and he is safe. And that feels really important to me, especially given what's happening right now.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Patrisse, I wanted to ask you - I don't know if you can answer this from your perspective, but I've been noticing in the reports that have been coming out about the protests and also about some of the looting and the vandalism that's broken out, that it's not just occurring in the major cities, but, for instance, in the Chicago suburbs. Faraway suburbs from the major city, like Aurora, Cicero and others, have also seen strange incidents of looting that have gone on. Do you have some concern that there may be some attempts to actually - deliberate attempts to provoke violence, to stir up greater animosity among some sectors of the American community?\n\nPATRISSE CULLORS : Absolutely. We know that there are three sets of folks who are out in the streets. There are protesters, those of us who are fighting against police brutality and police terror. There are white supremacists, those who are exploiting Black pain in this moment and really trying to undermine our protests. And then there's police, who sometimes act as protesters, so undercovers, and also uniformed officers, who have created significant amount of distress and havoc and confusion in protests. We have to be careful when we're protesting, both with COVID -19 but also because there are times where there's agent provocateurs and there's different people who have a different agenda than what our movement actually has.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We want to thank you, Patrisse, for joining us, Patrisse Cullors, political strategist, co-founder of Black Lives Matter, founder of Reform L.A. Jails. She is the author of When They Call You a Terrorist: A Black Lives Matter Memoir .\n\nWhen we come back, two autopsies agree George Floyd's death was a homicide. We'll go to Minneapolis for response. Stay with us.\n\n[break]\n\nAMY GOODMAN : \"$20 Bill (for George Floyd)\" by Tom Prasada-Rao.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "You turn to us for voices you won't hear anywhere else.\n\nSign up for Democracy Now!'s Daily Digest to get our latest headlines and stories delivered to your inbox every day.\n\nProfessional athletes are taking part in unprecedented collective action in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and against police violence, bringing basketball, baseball and soccer leagues to a grinding halt. The protests and calls to recognize systemic police brutality also extended across tennis arenas. Dave Zirin, sports editor for The Nation and host of the \"Edge of Sports\" podcast, says the actions constitute \"a sports strike wave\" for racial justice. \"It's more than a boycott. It's them withdrawing their labor,\" Zirin says. \"It's not just an example for racial justice protesters around the country. I think it's a challenge to the labor movement as a whole.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I'm Amy Goodman. In a remarkable development Wednesday, professional basketball, baseball, soccer games came to an unprecedented halt, after Milwaukee Bucks players refused to take to the court for a playoff game against the Orlando Magic in support of Black Lives Matter. The NBA then canceled all three of Wednesday's playoff games. Then, on TNT , former basketball star, the sports commentator Kenny Smith walked off the set of Inside the NBA in solidarity with the protesters.\n\nKENNY SMITH : As a Black man, as a former player, I think it's best for me to support the players and just not be here tonight, and figure out what happens after that. I just don't feel equipped to do that.\n\nERNIE JOHNSON JR.: And I respect that.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You then can't hear him much because he's taken off his microphone, and he walks off the TV set. The women's WNBA also canceled three games Wednesday after members of the Washington Mystics arrived wearing T-shirts, each with seven holes, symbolizing the seven bullet holes, in the back of their T-shirts, with the fronts of the T-shirts spelling out the name Jacob Blake, each woman wearing a T-shirt with one of the letters of Jacob Blake's name. This is Mystics guard Ariel Atkins.\n\nARIEL ATKINS : This isn't just about basketball. We aren't just basketball players. And just because we are basketball players doesn't mean that's our only platform. We need to understand that when most of us go home, we still are Black.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Three Major League Baseball games were postponed after players on the Milwaukee Brewers, Seattle Mariners and other teams joined protests. Mets slugger Dominic Smith kneeled for the national anthem ahead of Wednesday night's game against the Florida Marlins and broke down in tears at a post-game press conference. Most of Wednesday's Major League Soccer games were postponed. And the Western & Southern Open tennis tournament suspended matches after tennis superstar Naomi Osaka, whose father is Haitian, withdrew to protest against racial injustice.\n\nFor more, we're joined by Dave Zirin, sports editor for The Nation magazine, host of the Edge of Sports podcast.\n\nWelcome to Democracy Now! This is an amazing moment in this country's history, especially as, interestingly, yesterday, though Vice President Pence - it was talked about that he would condemn athletes for taking the knee. Forget taking the knee at this point. Athletes are not taking to the courts. They're not going out on the field. They are boycotting, Dave.\n\nDAVE ZIRIN : Yeah. It's great to be on with you and talk about what I think is best described as a sports strike wave for racial justice. It's more than a boycott. It's them withdrawing their labor and taking money out of the system and saying the games will not go on. It's not just an example for racial justice protesters around the country. I think it's a challenge to the labor movement as a whole to say, if this country is in fact nonfunctioning at the moment - and many believe this is not a functioning country - then labor has to assert itself in this battle and stand up. And that's exactly what the athletes are doing with this sports strike wave.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : NBC is reporting a group of athletes led by LeBron James are rolling out a multimillion-dollar program in the next few weeks to recruit poll workers in heavily Black electoral districts for the November election, a person familiar with the plan says. And didn't LeBron walk out of the bubble with others, and they're going to Washington to protest?\n\nDAVE ZIRIN : Yeah, LeBron is a big part of this story right now, because yesterday all the NBA players had a meeting after the games were canceled inside this bubble, this hermetically sealed bubble down in Orlando, Florida, and the Los Angeles Lakers and the Los Angeles Clippers - and LeBron is on the Lakers - they broke with the rest of the players and said, \"We don't want the playoffs to continue.\" Now, this could be a negotiating tactic, because they're meeting with the NBA bosses today, the franchise owners. They're called the franchise governors. And they're going to be speaking with them about what NBA owners can do to put their billions of dollars towards the cause of racial justice. And so, there still might be NBA playoffs, but right now LeBron is leading a very radical break from the players as a whole to wrest more reforms out of the NBA .\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, Dave, as we wrap up right now, just the significance, from the WNBA to the NBA to the much whiter baseball teams -\n\nDAVE ZIRIN : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : - all being in solidarity? What do you think this means, and for President Trump, who has made it a point at almost every speech to condemn anyone who takes a knee?\n\nDAVE ZIRIN : Yeah. For years, the world of sports has been a site of resistance to the racism of this administration, starting when Colin Kaepernick took that knee almost exactly four years ago to the date that the players made this decision. And this is just another chapter in that story about how the world of sports has been a site of resistance, an invaluable site of resistance, against the depravities of this administration.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Thank you so much for being with us. The Milwaukee Bucks read a team statement explaining their decision to boycott their playoff game against the Orlando Magic. We're going to play just a short clip of Sterling Brown and point guard George Hill.\n\nSTERLING BROWN : Despite the overwhelming plea for change, there has been no action. So, our focus today cannot be on basketball.\n\nGEORGE HILL : When we take the court and represent Milwaukee and Wisconsin, we are expected to play at a high level, give maximum effort and hold each other accountable. We hold ourselves to that standard. And in this moment, we are demanding the same from lawmakers and law enforcement. We are calling for justice for Jacob Blake and demand the officers be held accountable.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And, Dave Zirin, your final comment?\n\nDAVE ZIRIN : Just a final comment is that Sterling Brown, who spoke there, has his own lawsuit against the Milwaukee Police Department from when he was tased in 2018. So the players are not bystanders to this process. The players are looking at this world and saying what John Carlos said in 1968 before the Olympics, which is, \"Why should we run in Mexico City only to crawl home?\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Dave Zirin, sports editor for The Nation magazine, host of Edge of Sports podcast, thanks so much.\n\nWhen we come back, we hear part of Vice President Pence's acceptance address at the Republican National Convention.

      "text": "The Black Lives Matter era is over. It taught us the limits of diversity for diversity's sake\n\nHastily established racial equality schemes are being shuttered. What survives is a movement that's achieving real change\n\nI f 2020 was the year that Black Lives Matter went mainstream, 2024 was the year it died. Quietly, without even the customary whimper, the trappings of diversity so frantically sought and flamboyantly brandished after those protests four years ago are being discarded.\n\nLike so many of the promises and pledges of the pandemic era, those of its accompanying racial equality movement have been swallowed whole by reality. But it's worth remembering how large, how global, how fashionable it all was at the time. There were big, iconic moments, such as the removal of statues in Europe and the US, that triggered soul-searching about our history, and which opened up productive avenues of reappraisal. And there were others that four years later you cringe to remember: the black squares on social media, Nancy Pelosi taking the knee wearing kente cloth , Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner also taking the knee while looking soberly into the camera .\n\nWhen it came to institutions and corporations, this mass movement was translated - or, rather, flattened - into a question of representation; of quickly incorporating more Black people, rather than any kind of root-and-branch reform. A movement that had been triggered by police brutality, and whose main demand was reforming policing and the safety of marginalised Black communities, spread across the world and resulted in more Black faces on the cover of Vogue magazine .\n\nIn a way, it could only have ever been thus. If you are to measure the success of the movement through its most high-profile adoptions, then the initiatives that came out of this period, those that emphasised diversity, equity and inclusion in the workforce, were already stillborn. Bringing more people of colour into pre-existing structures is far too narrow a route to systemic racial equalisation - it could only ever, at best, replicate those systems in a broader palette.\n\nAt worst, it was exploitation for reputation-management purposes. Take the BBC's former head of creative diversity, Joanna Abeyie, who left last July after a year and a half in the role. She loved the job, she says, but that wasn't enough. \"These roles can become untenable when autonomy, influence and decision-making is minimal to absent,\" Abeyie wrote . \"When there is no sign of improvement and the role is created because optically it's the right thing to do.\" The role she reported to, that of director of diversity and inclusion, was quietly killed off when the person who held it left in early May after less than two years in the position.\n\nIt is part of a global slowdown. According to Revelio Labs , a workforce data company, the rate of attrition for diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) positions has been about double that of other roles. Outgoing DEI executives report not only an unsupportive work environment, but active hostility. And even before that, despite the big 2020 heave-ho, progress on employment and retention has been stubbornly slow, patchy or easily clawed back.\n\nThe BBC is still falling short of the BAME leadership target that it set in 2018 . The overall impression is of organisations assuming that this would be easy and would not require proper budgets, or uncomfortable transparency about salaries, seniority of roles and who ultimately calls the shots and makes the big decisions.\n\nBut it's not easy. The work of racial diversity is not about expansion, but rebalancing - the former is about supplementing an organisation; the latter is about redistributing its resources. One implies gains , the other loss. It's no surprise that to organisations that live and die by the bottom line, even the gains are beginning to seem as if they're not worth the effort. The legacy of Black Lives Matter cannot be worked out within the balance sheet of a tech company.\n\nEspecially as the moment has passed, colossally so. The backlash began before the kente cloth had come back from the dry cleaners. Black Lives Matter immediately entered the realm of culture war, included in the package of \"woke\" and radical causes that are to be summarily sneered at by rightwing parties and the rightwing press. It's not just an unfriendly climate. The backlash has brought with it potent, chilling legislation.\n\nIn the UK, Black Lives Matter was described as containing \"partisan\" political views that \"must not be promoted to pupils\", in government guidance about political impartiality in classrooms. In the US, a spate of contentious anti-DEI lawsuits by rightwing groups and individuals, recently encouraged by the supreme court ruling against affirmative action, have targeted small businesses and large established ones, prompting several to pre-emptively water down their diversity and inclusion policies.\n\nOne of the organisations sued for policies discriminatory to non-Black people is North Central University in Minneapolis. Legal Insurrection Foundation, a far-right advocacy group, accused the university of violating the Civil Rights Act by reserving a scholarship for Black or African American students. The scholarship, in a neat encapsulation of the onslaught against the spirit of 2020, is the George Floyd memorial scholarship.\n\nMeanwhile, there is a growing demonstration across the political spectrum that diversity and politics are two different things. Rishi Sunak's appointment as prime minister came with not only the same policies of crackdowns on strikes , protest and even human rights laws , but also a bitter bonus of using the promotions of Black and brown people to positions of power to scold us. We're here, aren't we? Sunak says, living proof that you should stop griping about racism.\n\nWhatever residual, misty-eyed longing there was for people of colour to reach the highest offices was surely dashed by a brown multimillionaire endlessly bleating that he is here to \"stop the boats\". Personally, little has been more helpful in removing the scales from my eyes than the notion that Kemi Badenoch's rise is something to be celebrated.\n\nSign up to The Long Wave\n\nNesrine Malik and Jason Okundaye deliver your weekly dose of Black life and culture from around the world\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nThat doesn't mean all of those models we have been offered so far amount to naught. Racial minorities have the right to bad or self-interested politics, and they have the right through diversity initiatives, whatever their motivations, to make more money and have more opportunities within whatever career they choose. It is not their responsibility to calibrate their role in nudging along the cause of better policing or maternal health when they just want to make movies, work in Stem or - to be fair - be on the cover of Vogue.\n\nAnd this is all progress that is meaningful, broadly redistributive, and even potentially fruitful in terms of coming close to meeting those broader political and economic goals in the long run. But it seems that even that window is closing in favour of brute \"meritocracy\" - which means, increasingly, closing the door to all those who don't already have a head start.\n\nWhich is why there must be something else that broadens the definition of equality beyond meeting liberal criteria of success for the Black individual. Away from the corporate world, that something is happening. BLM UK has for three years been disbursing funds to people affected by deaths in police and psychiatric custody, and to groups combating the hostile environment. It's on a much smaller scale than the sort of mass adoption of diversity as the answer we saw in 2020, but in it there is a committed understanding of racial justice as a goal that can be achieved only by tackling, in a focused way, the policies that fall sharply on the heads of the most insecure and hurt their health, safety, dignity and even basic participation in social and economic life.\n\nBlack Lives Matter as a mainstream taking of the knee may be dead; but in a more modest, targeted and, we can hope, sustainable way, it is still very much alive. And perhaps that's as it should be.\n\nNesrine Malik is a Guardian columnist"

      "text": "Black Lives Matter's Alicia Garza: 'Leadership today doesn't look like Martin Luther King'\n\nIn seven years, BLM has gone from hashtag to global rallying cry. So why has the co-founder stepped away from the movement she helped create?\n\nA licia Garza is not synonymous with Black Lives Matter , the movement she helped create, and that's very deliberate. The 39-year-old organiser is not interested in being the face of things; she's interested in change. \"We are often taught that, like a stork, some leader swoops from the sky to save us,\" she tells me over Zoom from her home in Oakland, California. That sort of mythologising, she says, \"obscures the average person's role in creating change\".\n\nGarza is also scornful of fame for fame's sake and of celebrity activists. The number of people who want to be online influencers rather than do the work of offline organising - knocking on doors, finding common ground, building alliances - depresses her. \"Our aspiration should not be to have a million followers on Twitter,\" she says. \"We shouldn't be focused on building a brand but building a base, and building the kind of movement that can succeed.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean Garza doesn't care about her image: for our interview, she has sneakily avoided having her webcam switched on, but only because she's \"doing a [skincare] face mask before your shoot today, so I didn't want to scare you\". While Garza is ferociously smart, laser-focused on \"pushing our political system to move from symbol to substance\", she also has a lighter side. She laughs often, draws you in; her passion is infectious.\n\nThe origin story of Black Lives Matter is one of collective, collaborative action rather than individual glory. After George Zimmerman was acquitted of fatally shooting Trayvon Martin , an unarmed black teenager, in 2013, Garza wrote a Facebook post she called \"a love letter to Black people\". Her friend Patrisse Cullors shared the post with the hashtag BlackLivesMatter. Another friend, Opal Tometi , designed the blacklivesmatter.com website and social media platforms, using the signature black and yellow colour palette. Seven years later, that rallying cry has changed our lexicon and landscape. Black Lives Matter has been chanted by millions of protesters around the world. It has been painted in giant letters on a road leading to the White House, and posted on windows in primary schools in Northamptonshire.\n\nThe evolution of Black Lives Matter, Garza says, has been \"deeply humbling, and super weird to watch\". Particularly considering she was repeatedly told, by everyone from pundits to peers, that the name sounded too threatening. \"People said we should call it All Lives Matter or Black Lives Matter Too, if we wanted to get more people involved. There have been so many full-circle moments.\"\n\nFour years ago, nobody talked explicitly about Black Lives Matter during the Democratic National Convention, for example. But, Garza says, you couldn't get through five minutes of this year's without the movement being namechecked. What's more, it's being talked about with \"more substance than we've seen before\". In the early days, many of the solutions being discussed in relation to the movement were \"relatively symbolic measures, like mandating that the police wear body cameras, requiring implicit bias training and setting up police reform taskforces\". Now, however, there are serious discussions about defunding the police; about \"whether or not policing keeps us safe. And that is a huge, huge change.\" Those conversations aren't just happening in the US, either; they're happening around the world.\n\nGarza attributes the movement's global spread to two catalysts: Donald Trump and his overtly racist administration; and Covid-19, which meant people were more likely to be at home and glued to their screens when George Floyd was killed on camera. \"Black Lives Matter is now in the muscle memory of many of us,\" Garza says. \"And it was triggered by watching a man murdered by a police officer, who stared into the camera as he did it.\"\n\nGarza has distilled the lessons she has learned from Black Lives Matter, and a decade of community organising, into her first book, The Purpose Of Power: How To Build Movements For The 21st Century . While the subtitle makes it sound like a how-to manual, one of its key lessons is that there is no quick and easy way to build a movement. As she writes, you don't just add \"water, oil and milk to a premixed batter; after 30 minutes in the oven, a movement is baked.\" Building movements, she stresses, means building alliances.\n\nGarza's book starts with a history of one of the most successful movements of recent times: rightwing conservatism in the US. One reason the right has been so powerful, she argues, is that it has been very effective at building \"networks and alliances and coalitions that all agree on the purpose of power - which is for them to keep it\". The right are very good at bringing different groups together around a shared vision, and have been \"building power for the last three decades\", Garza says, entrenching their agenda and values in the US. You can see it in the way conservatives have strategically, often surreptitiously, used the media to advance their ideology. Take Sinclair , for example, which late-night TV host John Oliver once called \"maybe the most influential media company you never heard of\". Owned by a fervent Trump supporter, it's the largest operator of local television stations in the US and has compelled its news anchors to parrot Trump talking points .\n\nIn particular, Garza says, the right has perpetuated the idea that success is purely a matter of personal responsibility. The message to poor people has been that it's their laziness holding them back; the message to black people, that systemic racism doesn't exist - the problem is their life choices. Worse, \"the narrative of personal responsibility for systemic failures has often been used by Black leaders to secure their seat at the table,\" Garza writes. That includes Barack Obama who, she notes, carefully avoided criticising law enforcement when Zimmerman was acquitted after the Martin shooting: \"He acknowledged that there is a long history of racial disparities in our criminal justice system while making sure to state that you can't blame the system.\" In adopting these \"rightwing talking points\", she says, he capitulated to the same people who had called him and Michelle Obama \"Muslim socialists\".\n\nObama isn't the only liberal hero Garza takes to task. Her book also analyses the way in which Bill Clinton ushered in legislation such as the 1994 federal crime bill , which greatly exacerbated mass incarceration. And she is unsparing about the racism of Hillary Clinton 's presidential primary campaign against Obama in 2008, citing an occasion when a photograph of Obama in traditional Somali dress was leaked to the media. (The Clinton campaign denied responsibility, but a Clinton supporter then went on MSNBC and said Obama shouldn't be ashamed of being seen in \" his native clothing \". )\n\nIt is unusual to see a nuanced critique of Clinton and Obama, I say. Does Garza think liberals idolise certain politicians, treating them like celebrities rather than public servants? Absolutely, she says: \"Our political system functions around personalities rather than policies, symbol over substance.\"\n\nOne example of that interplay, she says, can be seen in the case of Breonna Taylor , who was shot and killed in her home in Kentucky earlier this year. The day before our conversation, a grand jury has brought no direct charges against the police for killing Taylor, sparking widespread anger.\n\nFor Garza, there is an irony in the announcement. \"The attorney general of Kentucky, Daniel Cameron, is a Black Republican, and lots of people would say it's good that we have a Black person in this role, right? That's the symbol. But in Cameron's press conference, about not holding any of these officers accountable for her murder, he upheld and espoused racist ideas and policies. He announced that he was going to start a commission studying how they execute search warrants in Kentucky. So the symbol of a Black man in a position of power is not enough.\" What's needed is people in power who will create substantive and systemic change for black people.\n\nThere is also a big difference between popularity and power, Garza says. DeRay Mckesson , who has amassed more than a million Twitter followers after gaining prominence as a community journalist during the 2014 Ferguson unrest , is a case in point. Mckesson is probably the leading example of the celebrity activist phenomenon Garza decries, and her book uses his 2016 failed bid to be mayor of Baltimore as a cautionary tale about the limits of online fame. Despite his celebrity friends and high profile - Beyoncé follows him on Twitter, and Rashida Jones donated to his campaign - Mckesson won only around 2% of the vote in his home town. Garza's message is that you can't just tweet your way to political power; you've got to put in the work.\n\nMckesson's high profile means he is often (wrongly) credited with launching Black Lives Matter, and with the work Garza and her co-founders started. It's a mistake, she notes, that he often doesn't seem overly eager to correct. She is not, I want to emphasise, being petty here. I get the impression she's far too much of a pragmatist for that. \"This is bigger than DeRay,\" she tells me. \"It's a question of how we see leadership and who we think deserves it.\" The people who we think deserve to be elevated tend to be men; meanwhile, black women's labour is often overlooked and erased.\n\n\"Why,\" she asks, with a touch of frustration, \"are we holding on to a trope about leadership that is older than me? People are still looking for the Reverend Dr Martin Luther King Jr when, actually, leadership of movements today looks more like Lena Waithe and Laverne Cox .\" Cox is the first openly transgender person to be nominated for a Primetime Emmy award in an acting category, for Orange Is The New Black ; Waithe, a queer black writer, actor and producer, won an Emmy for the Netflix show Master Of None . \"The things that make us different, those are our superpowers,\" Waithe said in her acceptance speech.\n\nG arza knows a thing or two about being different. She was raised by her black mother and Jewish stepfather in Marin County, a predominantly white San Francisco suburb. She describes herself as queer. \"Maybe it's an outdated ass word,\" she laughs, but adds that it's a useful umbrella term for \"being more fluid in who I'm attracted to and who I build intimate relationships with.\" Garza is married to a trans man and activist, whom she met in 2003.\n\nDifference, she notes, can be a source of strength and power; it can give you a vantage point with \"potentially more range and insight\". Yet the NGOs for which she worked after graduating from the University of California, San Diego seemed to have little room for difference: while the staff were mainly people of colour, those running the show were white. She moved into more grassroots organising, fighting for affordable housing in San Francisco's black communities by building neighbourhood coalitions. This work, she says, changed the way she thought about politics. It was where she began to understand that winning is about more than being right; it's about inviting people to be part of a change they may not have known they needed.\n\nBlack Lives Matter has certainly mobilised people; but its move into the mainstream hasn't been without its issues. Garza accepts that the phrase has become a generic term that gets attached to anything related to police violence or black people. The decentralised nature of the organisation has contributed to the confusion.\n\nMistakes were also made as Black Lives Matter grew. It's hard to build a plane while you're flying it, Garza notes, and the organisation missed opportunities, such as developing clear demands to take on the 2016 campaign trail. Following eight years of a black president who hadn't brought as much hope and change as he'd promised, many within the network were disillusioned with electoral politics and focused on direct action instead.\n\nSo Garza has taken the insight she has gained from Black Lives Matter and channelled it into a new organisation called Black Futures Lab , which she launched in 2017. Protesting can only get you so far; now Garza wants politicians to feel as accountable to black people as they do to corporations. \"Our work is purely focused on making sure that Black people are powerful in politics, so that we can be powerful in every aspect of our lives,\" she explains.\n\nObviously \"Black voters are not a monolith\", Garza says, so one of the first challenges has been to create a consistent and coherent agenda for a diversity of experiences. In 2018, Black Futures Lab initiated what Garza calls \"the largest survey of Black people in America in 15 years\"; the resulting data went into developing the Black Agenda , a policy platform reflecting \"the most common concerns within Black communities across the political spectrum\". One policy point, for example, is raising the minimum wage to $15, a move 85% of respondents to the Black Census supported. Other demands include creating more opportunity for home ownership and limiting police presence in schools, to \"dismantle the school-to-prison pipeline\".\n\nNow that a policy platform has been developed, Garza is building support for it ahead of this year's presidential election. \"We've had 60,000 Black voters pledging to support the Black Agenda. What [these voters] are saying is that they will be using the agenda as they make decisions about who to vote for.\"\n\nThe Black Futures Lab occupies much of Garza's time now; she hasn't been involved in the day-to-day of Black Lives Matter for a few years. It might seem odd to step away from a movement just as it goes mainstream, but Garza isn't someone who wants to bask in her past achievements; it frustrates her how many times she's been asked the same questions about Black Lives Matter. She's focused on changing the future rather than rehashing the past.\n\nThat said, she hasn't completely cut herself off. \"Oh my God, of course,\" she says when I ask if she still hangs out with her co-founders. The three were recently in Los Angeles together for the Time 100: Most Influential People of 2020 photoshoot, she says warmly, and remain \"very much in touch\".\n\nGarza has had her camera off throughout our conversation; she isn't still wearing that face mask, I ask? We've been talking for an hour and I'm not sure how long you can leave those things on. \"I slipped it off,\" she reassures me. \"Now my face is nice and soft, and I'm gathering my things for the shoot. We've got to head over there in two minutes.\"\n\nBefore I let her go, I ask if she is anxious about the forthcoming election. Of course, she replies. But the way she handles that is by \"making sure I'm doing everything in my power\" to get the country back on track. There was a time when she was a cynic and thought the US was beyond saving, but over the last 10 years she has become profoundly hopeful. Now is the time to fight and to engage. Voting, she says, can also be a movement.\n\nThis article was amended on 20 October 2020 to remove some personal details."

      "text": "'Black Lives Matter' risks becoming an empty slogan. It's not enough to defeat racism\n\nThere are three powerful words that do expose discrimination. But you won't find them on a poster, or chanted in the street\n\nI f I hear one more white person say \"Black Lives Matter\" I think my head will explode. The slogan, powerful when first popularised by black people after the shooting of Trayvon Martin in 2012 in the US, has now become so ubiquitous as to have lost almost all meaning. A way for people to endlessly repeat \"I hate racism\" while doing nothing to actually stop it.\n\nWhite people, I assume you don't like the idea of other people being treated as inferior just because of the colour of their skin. But that's such a basic sentiment that you shouldn't be giving yourself a buzz from saying it.\n\nWhen even Boris Johnson can say \"Black Lives Matter\" - the same Boris Johnson who talks of African piccaninnies, of \"bank robber\" burqa wearers , who leads a party riven by Islamophobia but refuses a proper investigation into it, and who was part of a government that deported black British citizens, and continues the injustice of the hostile environment to this day - well, you know the slogan's cultural appropriation is complete.\n\nEven racists hate racism. That's why they're always looking for ways to excuse what they do. \"It's not my fault - black people are just a bit more criminal than white people.\" \"I'm not being racist - it's just that a lot of Muslims are terrorists.\" \"I'd love to recruit a black person - it's just that they're not quite the right fit for this role.\"\n\n\"It's just that ...\" You won't find this chanted in a city square by thousands of protesters, but these are probably the three most powerful words in the history of institutional racism. They're the words people say in private - or don't say - when they're making the decisions that really matter. They are the words that determine whether someone gets that job, or that business contract, or that university place, or that rented room.\n\nOver the past few days I've wondered, why now? Why, after all we've known about police brutality against black people, are people only now saying, en masse, that enough is enough? I think there are two core reasons. First, given the lockdown, there's not a lot else for young people to do. The anger is genuine, but the usual distractions that stop people from turning out have gone. It's the first time in months that young people have been able to be part of a group activity.\n\nBut the other factor is more fundamental: and that is, white guilt. While black people have raged about the shootings and asphyxiations, for most white people there's always been a get-out.\n\n\"It's just that [those words again] ... he was maybe being too aggressive ... maybe the officers thought they were under threat ... it was a spur-of-the-moment pull of the trigger.\" It's allowed white people to believe that, though the outcomes were all horrific, a white suspect in the same situation could have suffered the same fate. The George Floyd video crashed through that delusion. A subdued and incapacitated suspect; a knee pushed down on his neck as he pleaded for breath; passersby screaming for his life as it ebbed away; officer Derek Chauvin blithely ignoring it all, cocksure that he'd face no consequences for his actions; a fellow officer standing guard to prevent anyone coming to Floyd's rescue. For almost nine minutes, many of them after he had passed out. Nine minutes.\n\nNo white person could believe this could happen to them. That an officer of the law could be so callous, so unconcerned about the life of a white man.\n\nThat's why, this time, there have been unprecedented numbers of white people declaring their allegiance to the antiracism cause. On the streets, even in the US, most protesters have been white.\n\nThough  many of these new activists will have only a superficial understanding of race issues, it has to be a positive thing that at last they're starting to notice. This was nowhere more apparent than in Bristol this weekend. If it had been a black-only crowd, would the statue of notorious slavemaster Edward Colston really have been allowed to topple, let alone be dragged through the streets and dumped in the River Avon?\n\nMany British people were upset at what they saw. And I have some sympathy: mob rule is generally a bad thing, and risks getting disastrously out of hand. But what a glorious moment. It's an image that will last years in the memory, as the moment that people in one English city said the ritual humiliation of black lives was no longer acceptable. You can say \"Black Lives Matter\" a million times but it will change nothing. This action changed things.\n\nWhen I saw Floyd's life drain slowly away, I wondered why so little had changed since the Black Lives Matter movement swept across the US in 2014. Surely all US police officers should know they will be held accountable for any transgressions, especially when caught on camera? Chauvin clearly feared no repercussions.\n\nThere are 18,000 separate police forces in the US. In the UK there are 43. If we're going to bring about change we need to find a way to get into them all, change them all, and make those changes stick. It won't be by simply calling for more black police officers. That's been tried before, and any change is glacially slow. It won't be just by rooting out \"bad apples\": a system that allows them in unchecked in the first place is already rotten to the core. It won't simply be by giving all officers \"diversity training\": a couple of weeks on the streets after completing such a course, and they're back in the old routine, acting on the instincts and stereotypes.\n\nOn the day of the first major UK Black Lives Matter protest last Wednesday, the Metropolitan police commissioner, Cressida Dick, was giving evidence to the London assembly. She was talking, coincidentally, about the disproportionate number of fines handed out to black people during the coronavirus lockdown - double the rate for white people.\n\nThis, she explained, was partly because more officers have been operating in high-crime areas. To which the response must be, what has the lockdown got to do with high-crime areas? It's just another way in which black people (more likely to live in poorer areas, which are more likely to have higher crime rates) continue to be disproportionately targeted by the police. And then Dick added, as if trying to defend this: \"We've said again and again, be sensitive, be careful. And I think [our officers] have been. But I have to be honest, I haven't gone back to them to say, think about your unconscious bias.\" So there it is: we have officers disproportionately targeting black people, and nothing said to them in advance about being aware of the danger of racial stereotyping.\n\nThis is where leadership really counts: the day-to-day decisions, at the most senior levels, that affect thousands of lives. To make lasting change, we ultimately have to get off the streets and into the rooms where these decision-makers operate.\n\nBarack Obama has set out an intelligent long-term plan - \"How to make this moment the turning point for real change\" - which involves working locally with US mayors, district attorneys and local police chiefs.\n\nIn the UK we have to be equally thoughtful - so that every single officer, every single business chief, every head of every institution thinks every single day about the need to eradicate racism and bias. Black Lives Matter is a catchy slogan. But right now, action is what really matters.\n\nJoseph Harker is the deputy Opinion editor"

      "text": "US targeted Black Lives Matter activists in bid to disrupt movement, report finds\n\nCoalition of civil rights groups documents federal prosecutions of activists after the murder of George Floyd last year\n\nThe federal government deliberately targeted Black Lives Matter protesters via heavy-handed criminal prosecutions in an attempt to disrupt and discourage the global movement that swept the nation and beyond last summer after the Minneapolis police killed George Floyd , according to a new report.\n\nMovement leaders and experts said the prosecution of protesters over the past year continued a century-long practice by the federal government, rooted in structural racism, to suppress Black social movements via the use of surveillance tactics and other mechanisms.\n\nThe report was released by the Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of more than 50 activism and advocacy civil rights groups and professional associations representing Black communities and published in partnership with the Creating Law Enforcement Accountability and Responsibility (Clear) clinic at City University of New York (Cuny) School of Law.\n\n\"The empirical data and findings in this report largely corroborate what Black organizers have long known intellectually, intuitively, and from lived experience about the federal government's disparate policing and prosecution of racial justice protests and related activity,\" the report stated.\n\nThe report, which was first shared with the Associated Press, argues that as the uprisings in the summer of 2020 increased , so did police presence , the deployment of federal agents and prosecution of protesters.\n\nTitled Struggle For Power: The Ongoing Persecution of Black Movement By The US Government, the report details how policing has been used historically as a major tool to deter Black people from engaging in their right to protest, and to weaken efforts to draw attention to issues affecting Black Americans.\n\nIt also draws a comparison to how the government used counter-intelligence program techniques to \"disrupt the work of the Black Panther Party and other organizations fighting for Black liberation\".\n\n\"We want to really show how the US government has continued to persecute the Black movement by surveillance, by criminalizing protests, and by using the criminal legal system to prevent people from protesting and punishing them for being engaged in protests by attempting to curtail their first amendment rights,\" said Amara Enyia, the Movement for Black Lives' policy research coordinator.\n\n\"It is undeniable that racism plays a role,\" Enyia said. \"It is structurally built into the fabric of this country and its institutions, which is why it's been so difficult to eradicate. It's based on institutions that were designed around racism and around the devaluing of Black people and the devaluing of Black lives.\"\n\nIn the report, the Movement for Black Lives calls for amnesty for all protesters involved in the nationwide protests.\n\nThe group, also known as M4BL, is demanding reparations from the government that include an acknowledgment and an apology for the long history of targeting movements \"in support of Black life and Black liberation\".\n\nIt also is pushing for passage of the Breathe Act, proposed federal legislation that would radically transform the country's criminal justice system, and ending the use of joint terrorism taskforces in local communities.\n\nThe report also points to the stark difference in how the government handled the Covid-19 protests against local government shutdowns and mask mandates amid the pandemic during the same period.\n\nIt analyzes 326 criminal cases initiated by US federal prosecutors over alleged conduct related to protests in the wake of Floyd's murder and the police killings of other Black Americans , from31 May 2020 to 25 October 2020.\n\nA key finding of the report is that the push to use federal charges against protesters came from top-down directives from Donald Trump and the former attorney general William Barr.\n\nM4BL and Clear found that in 92.6% of the cases, there were equivalent state-level charges that could have been brought against defendants, mostly with less severe potential sentences.\n\n\"We saw Barr overnight go from expressing some level of sympathy for racial justice protesters to labeling them as radical and violent agitators with absolutely no basis for that sort of characterization,\" said Ramzi Kassem, founding director of Clear and a law professor at CUNY, adding that it was \"very transparently aimed at disrupting a Black-led movement for social justice that was happening both spontaneously and in an organized fashion nationwide\".\n\nRace data was only available for 27%, or 89, of the defendants. Of that number, 52% were identified as Black. Of the Black defendants, 91% were identified as male.\n\nPortland, Oregon, led in the number of charges brought for protest-related activity, making up 29% of federal charges. Chicago , Las Vegas, Washington, DC, and Minneapolis followed."

      "text": "Black Lives Matter movement nominated for Nobel peace prize\n\nNorwegian MP cites global impact of BLM in raising awareness and consciousness of racial injustice\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement has been nominated for the 2021 Nobel peace prize for the way its call for systemic change has spread around the world.\n\nIn his nomination papers, the Norwegian MP Petter Eide said the movement had forced countries outside the US to grapple with racism within their own societies.\n\n\"I find that one of the key challenges we have seen in America, but also in Europe and Asia, is the kind of increasing conflict based on inequality,\" Eide said. \"Black Lives Matter has become a very important worldwide movement to fight racial injustice.\n\n\"They have had a tremendous achievement in raising global awareness and consciousness about racial injustice.\"\n\nEide, who has previously nominated human rights activists from Russia and China for the prize, said one other thing that impressed him about the Black Lives Matter movement was the way \"they have been able to mobilise people from all groups of society, not just African-Americans, not just oppressed people, it has been a broad movement, in a way which has been different from their predecessors.\"\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement was co-founded in 2013 by Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors and Opal Tometi in response to the acquittal in the US of the man who shot Trayvon Martin . It gained wider recognition in 2014 following protests over the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner , and was the wellspring of a series of global protests in 2020 following the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor .\n\nNominations for the Nobel peace prize are accepted from any politician serving at a national level, and they are allowed just 2,000 words to state their case. The deadline for this year's submission is 1 February, and by the end of March the committee prepares a shortlist. The winner is chosen in October and the award ceremony is scheduled for 10 December. There were more than 300 nominations for last year's award, which was ultimately won by the World Food Programme .\n\nThe committee awarded the WFP because it wanted to \"turn the eyes of the world to the millions of people who suffer from or face the threat of hunger\", but perhaps the most high profile nomination last year was for former US president Donald Trump .\n\nTrump was nominated for a second time by another Norwegian MP, Christian Tybring-Gjedde. The far-right MP cited Trump's role in normalising relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates under the Abraham Accords, although Eide said Tybring-Gjedde had \"a little difficulty defending that nomination\" after the Capitol riot of 6 January when a pro-Trump mob stormed the US Congress buildings and five people died.\n\nEide, however, said he didn't want his nomination for Black Lives Matter to be seen as a comment on domestic US politics. And he dismissed criticism from rightwing voices that the group had been behind violence in US cities. \"Studies have shown that most of the demonstrations organised by Black Lives Matter have been peaceful,\" he said. \"Of course there have been incidents, but most of them have been caused by the activities of either the police or counter-protestors.\"\n\nData assembled by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project in September 2020 showed that 93% of Black Lives Matter demonstrations involved no serious harm to people or property.\n\nThe 61-year-old politician, who has represented the Socialist Left party in parliament since 2017, cited precedents of the Oslo-based Nobel prize committee recognising the battle against racism. Albert Luthuli and Nelson Mandela received the prize in 1960 and 1993 respectively for advocating against racial discrimination in South Africa, and Martin Luther King was awarded the prize for non-violent resistance against racism in the US in 1964. Mandela shared his award with FW de Klerk, the man who ordered the ANC leader's release from prison.\n\n\"There is actually a tradition for doing this,\" Eide said. \"It's a strong linkage between antiracism movements and peace, and a recognition that without this kind of justice, there will be no peace and stability in the society.\"\n\nHis written nomination concludes: \"Awarding the peace prize to Black Lives Matter, as the strongest global force against racial injustice, will send a powerful message that peace is founded on equality, solidarity and human rights, and that all countries must respect those basic principles.\""

      "text": "Patrisse Cullors on 10 years of Black Lives Matter: 'A painful reminder of what hasn't changed'\n\nThe BLM co-founder talks Tyre Nichols, LAPD's killing of her cousin and the fight for abolition: 'It's not individual bad officers, it's a culture of violence'\n\nW hen Patrisse Cullors first wrote the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter in 2013, it was a simple and powerful demand for Black liberation - a phrase that at the time felt to her like a \"freedom portal\" and a \"beacon of hope\".\n\nBut last month, the BLM co-founder and longtime organizer was faced with a personal and painful reminder of how little has changed in the 10 years since she helped spark a global movement. On 3 January, her cousin, Keenan Anderson , got in a traffic accident in Los Angeles and was met with LAPD officers who repeatedly Tased and restrained him before he died, sparking protests decrying yet another senseless killing by police in America.\n\nHeadlines about the beloved 31-year-old high school teacher and father were replaced, however, by stories about the killing of Tyre Nichols in Memphis , who was also subject to a traffic stop and Tased and fatally beaten by five officers .\n\nThe back-to-back killings in different parts of the country starkly illustrated how a decade of reforms have failed to stop police violence against Black people in the US, said Cullors, an abolitionist who has pushed for defunding and dismantling of US police and prisons.\n\nShe is part of a movement that argues that efforts to \"improve\" policing don't prevent brutality and death, as appears to be the case with the Memphis police, which killed Nichols despite having mandatory de-escalation policies, a majority Black police force, body cameras and requirements to intervene when witnessing excessive force. The best way to save lives, abolitionists argue , is to end the system rooted in punishment, control and surveillance and invest in community safety and services.\n\nCullors spoke to the Guardian about her cousin's legacy, her hopes for abolition and a surprise call she got from the Biden administration. This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nIt's been a month since Keenan's death. How are you and your family doing?\n\nMany families end up being positioned as leaders of this movement after their loved one has been killed by law enforcement. My family is no exception, but the irony is I helped start a movement specifically to challenge law enforcement and state violence and to call for abolition, and now it's deeply personal.\n\nIt's disappointing that we can't grieve privately, that we are forced to remind the public how important our loved one was, how needed he was, how necessary he was. But because of state-sanctioned violence and anti-Black racism, our family has to defend Keenan over and over again. I've seen it with Tyre. People are sharing the video of him skateboarding and being a free spirit and saying his life should've been valued. There are all these unnatural ways that families are forced to act under such terrible conditions. Many people don't have to go to the public and the media and yell at officials to value the life of their loved one who died. But that's what Black people do, especially those of us whose loved one was killed at the hands of the state.\n\nHow have you processed the news of Tyre's killing while dealing with your own grief and struggle for justice?\n\nIt's always deeply triggering to hear of the death of Black people, but it's different when you're in grief and trauma yourself. It's also made me feel even more adamant that I need to keep Keenan's name alive. The media is constantly moving on to the next story and death, and I see now how hard that is for so many families. So I see Keenan as part of a collective of ancestors of Black people killed by police. I believe in the role our ancestors play in helping create more healing in the world. Keenan, Tyre, Daunte Wright , Sandra Bland , Rekia Boyd , Breonna Taylor , George Floyd and Mike Brown and so many others who have been stolen from us are part of a collective of ancestors that have mandated us to keep talking about them, so we can enact change so this doesn't happen again.\n\nHow does it impact families when their relative's killing is highly publicized?\n\nOur last memory of Keenan is on video for the world to see. I don't know if people understand what that does to the human spirit and psychology. I can only imagine, as I've looked back in history and seen lynching photos of white people circled around a hanged Black body, that in 60 years from now, our children will look at these videos with similar disgust - how did we allow this to happen?\n\nAt this point in our country, it is the norm to be depressed about Black death, but also to see it as entertainment. There's a hyper-visibility, and also a deep devaluing. When those collide it makes for the most inhumane circumstances for Black people. It does not allow us to be full human beings. There's this expectation that we're all going to collectively witness Black people dying so viciously and violently, and then not do anything about it. What is the point of watching these videos if the people in charge aren't going to actually change the conditions?\n\nWhat do these killings tell us about the state of police reform efforts?\n\nKeenan and Tyre died only a few days apart from each other. That is incredibly telling about the nature of policing. It's not just about LAPD or Memphis police. These aren't individual bad officers. It's a culture of violence that has been inherited, and it's not going to stop until courageous elected officials make it stop. Media often asks me, 'Why is this still happening - you've been protesting for decades?' I say we've been protesting for 400 years, but also this keeps happening because people in power are allowing it. Millions of people went to the streets in 2020. Thousands were in the streets in 2013 and 2014. Every year, families, community members, organizers have said this must stop and there's a different way to do this. And yet there has been deep cowardice from officials. The burden is on the officials who create the budgets for the police and other resources, who turn away from the violence and continue it in their departments. It's truly a failure of leadership at the highest level, all the way up to our president. This movement was able to help get Joe Biden into office, and yet in his first State of the Union address, he yelled: \" Fund the police .\" It's a direct affront to the movement that called for resources out of policing and into social services. Our elected officials have decided to abandon a movement that could have saved the lives of the people who have died.\n\nHow do we move forward? How can elected officials be \"courageous\", as you put it?\n\nWe have a powerful opportunity right now at the national, state and city levels to reevaluate law enforcement's role in traffic stops. We have to get cops out of traffic stops. It's one, very reasonable demand. Tyre, my cousin, Sandra Bland are all examples of this. Law enforcement pulls people over for broken tail lights, for no registration, for running a red light, for all these low-level traffic violations. There's research to back up the reasonableness of the demand to not allow police to be the ones who are stopping mostly Black people . Berkeley , Philadelphia and Seattle are piloting this. Los Angeles has said it was too radical, and then my cousin was killed. We should also fund evaluations of these policies, so we can get the data and avoid backlash.\n\nI actually got a call from Pete Buttigieg. He said, \"I just wanted to say I'm sorry,\" and asked if there's anything he could do. I couldn't really think about it then, but I've been thinking now about how he's the secretary of transportation, and this is a powerful opportunity where he could be helping lead a conversation about what federal dollars could fund programs to remove law enforcement from traffic stops.\n\nThe Memphis chief also eliminated the Scorpion unit , which was responsible for Tyre's death. And many police departments have units like this that are given entirely too broad of a mandate with truly disastrous results for communities and taxpayers. So we need to get rid of these units that create trauma and harm, and put that money back into communities.\n\nThe demand about traffic stops is clear and specific, but instead we're seeing many officials make familiar calls to improve training and fix \" culture \" - what do you make of that?\n\nIt's exhausting and also terrifying. It's this constant cycle in which Black people get killed, we say, hey, here are meaningful demands that will help change the conditions so we don't get killed, and then we're gaslit, and someone brings forward the same idea from ten years ago that didn't work. So the question is, why don't you want to change this? And how will you protect Black life?\n\nAnd in LA, there have been three deaths at the hands of LAPD this year, but this week there was a unanimous vote by the police commission and our first female Black mayor to reappoint the chief, Michel Moore. So that's a huge blow. We need officials to reassess their values - what is more important, your political relationships or ensuring that the Black people in your city live long, full and healthy lives?\n\nCan you tell me what the statement Black Lives Matter meant to you when you first posted it ten years ago, and how you think about it today?\n\nTen years ago, the phrase felt like a freedom portal. It felt like one way to articulate a broader movement that's not just about Black death, but that's about Black life. Ten years ago, Black Lives Matter was a beacon of hope. It was a phrase that felt so pure, so liberating, so clarifying. It still feels that way, but it also feels like a painful reminder of what hasn't changed. When our family decided to go public about Keenan, I remember putting his picture up and then hashtagging #BlackLivesMatter, and it felt like a sting, a reminder that the people who hold the power have chosen not to wield it on behalf of Black life. They've chosen to side with violent police forces.\n\nI thought we could end our conversation on Keenan - what message would you want to share about your cousin?\n\nKeenan, you were loved and you are loved. Your family, your friends, your community will never allow you to be forgotten. Justice would be having you alive right now, but you were taken from us. So you will not die in vain. And I want the world to understand that first and foremost: I won't let my cousin die in vain."

      "text": "'So many people care!' The young Britons whose lives were changed by Black Lives Matter\n\nIf anyone thought this summer's protests would be the end of the movement, these five activists have different ideas\n\nT he killing of George Floyd by a white police officer was the catalyst for widespread anti-racist protests in the US this summer. Though Floyd's death took place thousands of miles away, the cry for racial justice was felt deeply in the UK. Britons stood up against racism, declaring support in their thousands for the Black Lives Matter movement via a succession of passionate protests.\n\nMore than 260 towns and cities held protests in June and July - from Monmouth in south Wales to Shetland in Scotland. British historians described them as the largest anti-racism rallies since the slavery era and at the heart of many of these protests was a new generation of young black Britons.\n\nAlthough the protests were inspired by the movement in the US, the protesters' anger was rooted in the British experience. They carried handmade placards with the names of Mark Duggan , Sean Rigg , Sheku Bayoh and others killed by British police. They chanted for the Windrush generation and the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire , and decried the high Covid-19 death rate among members of the BAME community.\n\nIn a groundbreaking series in August, titled Young, British and Black , the Guardian interviewed 50 protesters, from Glasgow to Newcastle and Abergavenny to Falmouth, on what inspired them to organise the country's biggest anti-racism rallies for centuries. As well as citing the painful experiences of growing up black in the UK, they said they were fighting for a radically more equal society.\n\nWe catch up with five protesters to find out what has happened since and where the movement for racial equality goes next.\n\nA student and co-organiser of one of the first UK Black Lives Matter protests in May, Natasha has since helped found All Black Lives . It is a youth-led campaign, with a group who held Black Lives Matter protests every Sunday for 10 weeks in several major UK cities. All Black Lives was behind the march through Bristol in June when demonstrators toppled a statue of the slave trader Edward Colston .\n\n\"Since the spring, we've managed to ride the momentum to form established teams in London, Manchester, Bristol and Birmingham,\" says Natasha. They have been working to get their message across on social media, holding several panels throughout Black History Month , and producing informative videos. \"There's even talk of venturing into politics,\" she says.\n\nAll Black Lives has a number of demands, which include the abolition of the Metropolitan police's gang violence matrix and changing the school curriculum to include more black history.\n\nBut its struggles go beyond the UK. \"We've been doing a lot of protests with EndSARS [a movement against Nigeria's special anti-robbery squad ],\" says Natasha.\n\nOver the past six months, Natasha says she has become more resilient. \"I've learned so much, but I'm always keen on learning more ... If you learn how the house is built, you're going to know how to dismantle it.\"\n\nOn the day the Young, British and Black series was first published, Benitha Iradukunda was shocked to find her face on the front page of the paper. \"My university saw it and mentioned it on their social media and my old high school teachers messaged me sending well wishes,\" she says.\n\nIradukunda was one of the organisers behind the Black Lives Matter rallies in Edinburgh. The group is now setting up a charity, the African Caribbean Society for Scotland, to support the black community in a range of issues, from health and education to economic empowerment. The organisation has held online Black History Month events, including a series of interviews and a DJ set.\n\n\"I've also started a podcast called Speak Your Truth, which features conversations with black people in the Scottish community,\" says Iradukunda. \"A lot of people think activism should be a really big in-your-face thing, but there are little things you can do, like have conversations.\"\n\nShe also feels that the Black Lives Matter movement has helped shift discussions about racism in the UK, which have tended to focus on the south of the country.\n\n\"People down south are always shocked that black people live in Scotland. They don't realise how big the community is here,\" she says. \"We're 1% in Scotland, but we're very present\"\n\nAfter participating in protests in Northampton, Tré Ventour was invited to London to take part in a Black Lives Matter panel event. While he is excited by the broadening interest in black British history, he feels there is more to be done.\n\n\"When we celebrate black people in Black History Month, it's very much 'acceptable' black people, like Walter Tull . So when we do black history are we acknowledging the diversity of black lives? I am not sure we are,\" he says. Ventour also wants the focus to include black LGBT history and is keen for the movement to have a conversation about intersectionality. \"When you look at blackness in the context of LGBT, specifically trans people, they are victims of not just police violence, but violence in general.\"\n\nHe admits he was surprised at the number of people who rose up and joined the Black Lives Matter protests. \"So many more people care than I thought,\" he says. \"The protests have shown there is still community in Britain, despite everything. In places like Northampton, I think that's really important.\"\n\nSince the protests, many people have congratulated 17-year-old Lexia Richardson for speaking about her experience of growing up and going to school in a predominantly white area. \"I think a lot of people I work with didn't realise how much racism I had been through,\" she says.\n\nSeveral black and Muslim people got in touch with Richardson to tell her they had gone through similar things.\n\nShe is currently working on a Black Lives Matter project for the school where she was previously a pupil and wants to ensure conversations on racism in the UK continue. At her sixth form college, she is happy to hear people discussing the protests and whether the movement is needed in the UK. But she is most proud of the impact she has had at home.\n\n\"Getting my voice heard has helped my younger siblings,\" she says. \"They feel like it's OK to follow in my pattern. My 11-year-old brother made a movie about BLM to show to his class. I thought: 'Wow, I could have never done that at that age.'\"\n\nShekinah Swamba, who works part-time in Waitrose, has had customers ask if she was the one that organised Black Lives Matter protests in the area. \"A branch manager approached me and said well done. We sat down and had a chat. He wanted to know what he could do in our branch. I gave him some suggestions, such as mentoring,\" she says. John Lewis and Waitrose announced a mentorship scheme soon after; through it, Swamba is paired up with a woman in Liverpool.\n\nSwamba has since helped set up the Local Equality Commission , which works to combat racial and economic inequality in rural communities. \"My role is a mentorship programmer,\" she says. \"I want to create an environment where people can be supported in various disciplines and have their voices heard on all matters of interest.\"\n\nShe has also met with her local MP and taken part in panel discussions. \"Up until June, I never felt confident to say that I moved schools because I received a lot of racism; I always dodged the question,\" she says. \"Now I feel more confident in myself and I have got a lot more self-belief.\""

      "text": "Nearly all Black Lives Matter protests are peaceful despite Trump narrative, report finds\n\nIn stark contrast to rightwing claims, 93% of demonstrations have involved no serious harm to people or property\n\nThe vast majority of the thousands of Black Lives Matter protests this summer have been peaceful, with more than 93% involving no serious harm to people or damage to property, according to a new report tracking political violence in the United States.\n\nBut the US government has taken a \"heavy-handed approach\" to the demonstrations, with authorities using force \"more often than not\" when they are present, the report found.\n\nAnd there has been a troubling trend of violence and armed intimidation by individual actors, including dozens of car-ramming attacks targeting demonstrators across the country.\n\nThe new data on protests and the US government's response comes from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project (Acled), an organization that has long tracked political violence and unrest in regions around the world, together with Princeton University's Bridging Divides Initiative.\n\nData assembled by Acled has been viewed as a reliable source of information on the death toll in Yemen , civilians killed by governments in Africa and political violence against women , among other conflicts. The organization launched a new \"US crisis monitor\" project this year, concerned that the US is \"at heightened risk of political violence and instability going into the 2020 general election\".\n\nThe results of the study present a stark contrast to claims made by the Trump administration, and widely circulated by Fox News and other rightwing media outlets, that the US is being overrun by violent leftwing protesters and \"domestic terrorists\".\n\n\"There have been some violent demonstrations, and those tend to get a lot of media coverage,\" Dr Roudabeh Kishi, Acled's director of research & innovation, told the Guardian. \"But if you were to look at all the demonstrations happening, it's overwhelmingly peaceful.\"\n\nBetween late May and the end of the August, Acled and Princeton researchers documented 7,750 demonstrations associated with the Black Lives Matter movement in more than 2,000 different locations across the United States, as well as more than 1,000 protests related to Covid-19. About a third of the Covid-19 protests were linked to schools reopening, the report found, all of them peaceful protests. There were also at least 70 documented protests over Covid-19 involving healthcare workers, and at least 37 demonstrations focused on the eviction crisis.\n\nWhile the overwhelming majority of all the different kinds of protests tracked over this time were peaceful, the report did find a troubling trend of violence from both government forces and non-state actors.\n\nGovernment authorities were more likely to intervene in Black Lives Matter protests than in other demonstrations, and also more likely to intervene with force, like using teargas, rubber bullets and pepper spray or beating demonstrators with batons, the researchers found.\n\nThey documented 392 incidents this summer in which government authorities used force on Black Lives Matter demonstrators.\n\nJournalists covering Black Lives Matter protests were also met with violence from government forces in at least 100 separate incidents across dozens of states this summer. One journalist was blinded after being hit in the eye with a rubber bullet while covering protests over George Floyd's killing in Minneapolis.\n\nViolent intervention from government forces did not make protests more peaceful, the report concluded. In Portland specifically, the report found that intervention from federal authorities in the protest \"only aggravated unrest\", with the number of \"violent demonstrations\" rising from 53% to nearly 62% of all events \"after federal agents arrived on the scene\".\n\nArmed individuals were documented at at least 50 protests this summer.\n\n\"Individual perpetrators - sometimes linked to hate groups like the KKK - have launched dozens of car-ramming attacks targeting demonstrations around the country,\" the researchers wrote."

      "text": "U.S. Marshals Used Drones to Spy on Black Lives Matter Protests in Washington, D.C.\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe flights, revealed in documents obtained by The Intercept, underscore the growing militarization of policing.\n\nThe U.S. Marshals Service flew unmanned drones over Washington, D.C., in response to last summer's Black Lives Matter protests, documents obtained by The Intercept via the Freedom of Information Act show.\n\nThe documents - two brief, heavily redacted emails - indicate the Marshals flew the drones over Washington on June 5 and 7, when nationwide protests against police brutality in the wake of George Floyd's murder were at their height. The surveillance flights occurred just days after the Trump administration ordered the mobilization of the near entirety of federal law enforcement against Washington's protesters. The aggressive physical crackdown against Black Lives Matter rallies, particularly in Washington, D.C. , spurred its own wave of outrage as police beat, chased, and chemically dispersed largely peaceful demonstrators. Less visible law enforcement responses to the rallies also drew intense criticism, including the use of social media surveillance and, in particular, the use of aerial surveillance over multiple cities by the Air National Guard and Department of Homeland Security. Government aircraft monitored 15 cities during the protests, according to the New York Times, filming demonstrators in New York, Philadelphia, and Dayton, Ohio; a Predator drone was deployed over Minneapolis.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nOne email provided by the Marshals Service is dated June 5 and carries the subject line \"UAS Status for Protests,\" apparently referring to Unmanned Aircraft Systems, common military jargon for drones. It contains only a few fragments of unredacted text but appears to have contained notes from a \"UAS briefing in response to the protests\" and states that a redacted entity \"responded to Washington DC\" and \"conducted one flight,\" the same day Mayor Muriel Browser asked Donald Trump to \"withdraw all extraordinary law enforcement and military presence from Washington, DC.\"  The June 7 email is similarly fragmentary and censored but notes that the redacted entity once again \"responded to Washington DC\" and \"conducted several flights.\"\n\nMarshals Service spokesperson James Stossel declined to answer any questions about the purpose of the June 5th and 7th flights or what data was collected, stating, \"The USMS does not release details of operational missions,\" and denied that the Marshals flew drones over the city on any other dates. Asked how the robotic aerial surveillance of protests conforms with the agency's narrowly defined mission, Stossel said, \"The Marshals Service conducts a broad array of missions as authorized by Federal Law which may include ensuring the rule of law is maintained during protests.\" Press reports from this period describe the protests in question as peaceful.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage Protests for Black Lives\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nThe previously unreported flights raise the question of why the U.S. Marshals Service would be flying drones over mass gatherings of First Amendment-protected activity in the nation's capital. The marshals are the oldest law enforcement branch in the United States, dating to the 18th century, and their present day grab bag of responsibilities is more or less constrained to protecting courthouses, asset forfeitures, operating the Witness Protection Program, transporting prisoners, and hunting fugitives. The vestigial agency has historically been cagey about the existence or purpose of its drone program: In 2013, the Los Angeles Times reported , \"In 2004 and 2005, the U.S. Marshals Service tested two small drones in remote areas to help them track fugitives,\" but the test was \"abandoned ... after both drones crashed.\"\n\nDocuments obtained by the American Civil Liberties Union that same year via the Freedom of Information Act were also heavily redacted, providing only murky outlines of how the agency was conducting aerial surveillance. These ACLU documents stated that the Marshals possessed a \"rapidly deployable overhead collection device that will provide a multi-role surveillance platform to assist in [redacted] detection of targets.\" Another document provided to the ACLU noted that the marshals deployed surveillance drones through their Technical Operations Group, or TOG, which \"provides the U.S. Marshal Service, other federal agencies, and any requesting state or local law enforcement agency, with the most timely and technologically advanced electronic surveillance and investigative intelligence available in the world,\" according to the Marshals Service website. The Marshals' spokesperson, however, told The Intercept, \"No USMS UAS flights were conducted at the request of any other agency.\"\n\nWhile the Marshals Service quietly acknowledged the existence of its drone surveillance \"pilot program\" in its 2020 annual report , the flights were largely described as tied to the agency's core responsibility of apprehending fugitives. But the document does briefly note that \"UAS operators also deployed ... in support of the USMS mission during the nationwide civil unrest in Summer 2020.\" The report doesn't mention what exactly this drone-based \"support\" entailed, but the Marshals' on-the-ground violence against protesters in Portland prompted widespread criticism last summer.\n\nExperts say it's still unclear why the U.S. Marshals are even in a position to conduct these flights in the first place. \"How did it become part of the mission of U.S. Marshals Service to engage in aerial surveillance during a protest movement?\" said Jay Stanley, senior policy analyst at the ACLU. \"It's hard to know with all the secrecy, but it looks like once again, powerful high-tech tools sold to the public for use against the worst criminals are now being deployed against peaceful protesters and activists.\"\n\nMatthew Guariglia, a policy analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told The Intercept that the fact there's a Marshals Service drone program at all is indicative of how thoroughly crime-fighting agencies in the United States now resemble war-fighting forces: \"The Marshals service has drones for much the same reason that many local police departments have tanks,\" Guariglia said. \"The slow militarization of local and federal law enforcement as a result on the war on crime, war on drugs, and war on terror have created dozens of desperate law enforcement agencies with advanced technology and bloated budgets.\" The mere knowledge that a drone is or even could be watching demonstrators \"threatens to chill out right to protest,\" Guariglia added.\n\nStanley also objected to the near-full redaction of the flight emails, which the Marshals Service argued was warranted on the basis that they would reveal secret investigative techniques and \"could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.\" But as Stanley pointed out, it's not as if flying a camera-packing drone over a throng of people is a new or secret technique in the year 2021. \"How high are the chances they used their drones in some clever, innovative way they need to keep secret because nobody else has thought of it?\" he explained. \"No matter how they're using it, the Marshals Service needs to be open and transparent given the relative novelty of drones as a law enforcement surveillance tool and their significant implications for our privacy. This kind of reflexively secretive behavior is one reason activists and communities tend not to give agencies the benefit of the doubt when they seek new surveillance technologies.\"\n\nUpdate: April 23, 2021 This article was updated to clarify the comments of USMS spokersperson James Stossel\n\nWAIT!

It's unclear if the police request, relayed to customers through Amazon's Ring subsidiary, was directed to a single camera owner or many; contemporaneous emails released by the department show that Ring's in-house law enforcement liaisons were helping officers use an interface that would allow them to send bulk video requests to specific neighborhoods or broader geographic areas.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\n\"The LAPD 'Safe L.A. Task Force' is asking for your help,\" reads the message, from detective Gerry Chamberlain. \"During recent protests, individuals were injured & property was looted, damaged, and destroyed. In an effort to identify those responsible, we are asking you to submit copies of any video(s) you may have for [redacted].\" The request appears to have made no mention of what exactly the LAPD was pursuing; no crime, proven or alleged, is described in the unredacted portion of the request, only that the police wanted footage of an unspecified \"incident\" related to a protest. The redacted portion of the request does not appear to contain any substantive further description.\n\nThe records obtained by the EFF show that LAPD detectives sent video requests to Ring owners on several other occasions coinciding with large street protests in Los Angeles, but the details of those messages were fully redacted, making it impossible to determine what exactly police were after.\n\nEmail copy of a Ring customer video data request filed by the LAPD. Image: Obtained by The Intercept\n\nEmail copy of a Ring customer video data request filed by the LAPD.\n\nIn October, the Los Angeles Times cited LAPD data showing that the \"vast majority\" of the city's Black Lives Matter rallies, part of a national wave of outraged mobilization following the police killing of Floyd, were peaceful, with only \"between 6% and 7%\" of protests resulting in any violence, including violence perpetrated by the LAPD itself. It's unclear what data, if any, was turned over to the task force as a result of the protest-related Ring request, but the EFF says that it believes the message is the first evidence of police using Ring's increasingly ubiquitous camera network to surveil last summer's Black Lives Matter protests.\n\n\"Demonstrators have a First Amendment-protected right to protest, but there is also a long history in this country, from long before the civil rights movement up through the present, of activists facing retribution and reprisals for their political participation,\" explained Matthew Guariglia, a historian and surveillance policy analyst with the EFF. \"This can be especially troubling, and especially chilling to political expression, when people are protesting the same institutions doing the surveillance, namely the police. Ring requests provide an unregulated avenue through which police could theoretically use a trash can being knocked over as justification for requesting footage of 12 hours of peaceful protesting.\"\n\nNeither the LAPD nor Ring would answer questions from The Intercept about the purpose of this request, how the video data was used, or whether LAPD made similar requests. Ring spokesperson Yassi Shahmiri said that the company \"expressly prohibits Video Requests for lawful activities, such as protests\" and believed that Detective Chamberlain's request was intended to \"identify individuals responsible for theft, property damage, and physical injury.\"\n\nThe task force's message, sent via the bespoke data portal Ring provides to departments across the country , specified a date and time range for the videos it sought, but that range was redacted by the LAPD. It's also unclear how wide an array of footage the department was requesting, leaving open the possibility that even if an actual crime had been committed in view of a camera, footage of unrelated people merely exercising their First Amendment rights in public could have also been turned over to the LAPD. Ring's video-sharing interface provides no way of removing unrelated people from footage before sharing it, and the task force told the Los Angeles Times last year that it had used facial recognition software to identify people believed to have committed crimes during the protests. Policies guiding how long cops can retain privately obtained data like Ring videos - and what they can do once it lands on their hard drives - are rare and typically weak.\n\nIndeed, a key upside of Ring footage for police is that it can be obtained through direct requests to camera owners, bypassing the judicial review needed when trying to compel the sharing of such video. \"Once you hand over footage to police for investigating a package theft or car break-in, they can hold onto it or forward it to other agencies without your knowledge or permission,\" explained Guariglia.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nRing operates a social app called Neighbors that allows people in the same community to share videos and alerts about purportedly suspicious individuals and alleged criminality. The potential for innocent people to fall within the scope of Ring's ever-expanding dragnet and the company's persistent work to help funnel untold volumes of video data to police have been long-standing concerns of privacy advocates and civil libertarians, who say the company is blurring an already tenuous line between public and private surveillance . Ring, which has imbued its work with a law-and-order, pro-police corporate ethos both before and after its acquisition by Amazon in 2018, provides cops with a vast, unprecedented network of thousands and thousands of privately owned unblinking eyes and always-listening ears in cities and towns large and small, all connected to the internet.\n\nRights groups worry that Ring's police video-sharing systems pressure private citizens into turning over their data without the oversight of a judge. But since many Ring owners store their video on Amazon's servers, data is accessible via court order should a customer ignore or deny an officer's request for cooperation. Though the LAPD request for protest-related footage notes that \"sharing your video recordings with the Los Angeles Police Department is entirely optional,\" that disclaimer is followed by a large button that launches the Ring app, beginning the sharing process. A 2019 report by Motherboard showed that Ring coaches police departments on how best to cajole the company's customers into voluntarily sharing their surveillance videos. Though Ring emphasizes the technically voluntary nature of its police data-sharing scheme, this elides the fact that the people actually captured on camera have consented to nothing. \"Yes, data requests are voluntary and footage is shared with the consent of the user,\" Guariglia said, \"but the footage and audio they are sharing only rarely portray the consenting user.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "FBI Hired Social Media Surveillance Firm That Labeled Black Lives Matter Organizers \"Threat Actors\"\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nA new Senate report calls out the FBI for lying to Congress about its social media monitoring, pointing out the FBI's hiring of ZeroFox.\n\nThe FBI's primary tool for monitoring social media threats is the same contractor that labeled peaceful Black Lives Matter protest leaders DeRay McKesson and Johnetta Elzie as \"threat actors\" requiring \"continuous monitoring\" in 2015.\n\nThe contractor, ZeroFox, identified McKesson and Elzie as posing a \"high severity\" physical threat, despite including no evidence that McKesson or Elzie were suspected of criminal activity. \"It's been almost a decade since the referenced 2015 incident and in that time we have invested heavily in fine-tuning our collections, analysis and labeling of alerts,\" Lexie Gunther, a spokesperson for ZeroFox, told The Intercept, \"including the addition of a fully managed service that ensures human analysis of every alert that comes through the ZeroFox Platform to ensure we are only alerting customers to legitimate threats and are labeling those threats appropriately.\"\n\nThe FBI, which declined to comment, hired ZeroFox in 2021, a fact referenced in the new 106-page Senate report about the intelligence community's failure to anticipate the January 6, 2021, uprising at the U.S. Capitol. The June 27 report, produced by Democrats on the Senate Homeland Security Committee, shows the bureau's broad authorities to surveil social media content - authorities the FBI previously denied it had, including before Congress. It also reveals the FBI's reliance on outside companies to do much of the filtering for them.\n\nThe FBI's $14 million contract to ZeroFox for \"FBI social media alerting\" replaced a similar contract with Dataminr, another firm with a history of scrutinizing racial justice movements. Dataminr, like ZeroFox, subjected the Black Lives Matter movement to web surveillance on behalf of the Minneapolis Police Department, previous reporting by The Intercept has shown.\n\nIn testimony before the Senate in 2021, the FBI's then-Assistant Director for Counterterrorism Jill Sanborn flatly denied that the FBI had the power to monitor social media discourse.\n\n\"So, the FBI does not monitor publicly available social media conversations?\" asked Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema.\n\n\"Correct, ma'am. It's not within our authorities,\" Sanborn replied, citing First Amendment protections barring such activities.\n\nSanborn's statement was widely publicized at the time and cited as evidence that concerns about federal government involvement in social media were unfounded. But, as the Senate report stresses, Sanborn's answer was false.\n\n\"FBI leadership mischaracterized the Bureau's authorities to monitor social media,\" the report concludes, calling it an \"exaggeration of the limits on FBI's authorities,\" which in fact are quite broad.\n\nIt is under these authorities that the FBI sifts through vast amounts of social media content searching for threats, the report reveals.\n\n\"Prior to 2021, FBI contracted with the company Dataminr that used pre-defined search terms to identify potential threats from voluminous open-source posts online, which FBI could then investigate further as appropriate,\" the report states, citing internal FBI communications obtained as part of the committee's investigation. \"Effective Jan. 1, 2021, FBI's contract for these services switched to a new company called ZeroFox that would perform similar functions under a new system.\"\n\nThe FBI has maintained that its \"intent is not to 'scrape' or otherwise monitor individual social media activity,\" instead insisting that it \"seeks to identify an immediate alerting capability to better enable the FBI to quickly respond to ongoing national security and public safety-related incidents.\" Dataminr has also previously told The Intercept that its software \"does not provide any government customers with the ability to target, monitor or profile social media users, perform geospatial, link or network analysis, or conduct any form of surveillance.\"\n\nWhile it may be technically true that flagging social media posts based on keywords isn't the same as continuously flagging posts from a specific account, the notion that this doesn't amount to monitoring specific users is misleading. If an account is routinely using certain keywords (e.g. #BlackLivesMatter), flagging those keywords would surface the same accounts repeatedly.\n\nThe 2015 threat report for which ZeroFox was criticized specifically called for \"continuous monitoring\" of McKesson and Elzie. In an interview with The Intercept, Elzie stressed how incompetent the FBI's analysis of social media was in her situation. She described a visit the FBI paid her parents in 2016, telling them that it was imperative she not attend the Republican National Convention in Cleveland - an event she says she had no intention of attending and which troll accounts on Twitter bearing her name claimed she would be at to foment violence. (The FBI confirmed that it was \"reaching out to people to request their assistance in helping our community host a safe and secure convention,\" but did not respond to allegations that they were trying to discourage activists from attending the convention.)\n\n\"My parents were like why would she be going to the RNC? And that's where the conversation ended because they couldn't answer that.\"\n\n\"I don't think [ZeroFox] should be getting $14 million dollars [from] the same FBI that knocked on my family's door [in Missouri] and looked for me when it was world news that I was in Baton Rouge at the time,\" Elzie told The Intercept. \"They're just very unserious, both organizations.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe FBI was so dependent on automated social media monitoring for ascertaining threats that the temporary loss of access to such software led to panic by bureau officials.\n\n\"This investigation found that FBI's efforts to effectively detect threats on social media in the lead-up to January 6th were hampered by the Bureau's change in contracts mere days before the attack,\" the report says. \"Internal FBI communications obtained by the Committee show how that transition caused confusion and concern as the Bureau's open-source monitoring capabilities were degraded less than a week before January 6th.\"\n\nOne of the FBI communications obtained by the committee was an email from an FBI official at the Washington Field Office, lamenting the loss of Dataminr, which the official deemed \"crucial.\"\n\n\"Their key term search allows Intel to enter terms we are interested in without having to constantly monitor social media as we'll receive notification alerts when a social media posts [sic] hits on one of our key terms,\" the FBI official said.\n\n\"The amount of time saved combing through endless streams of social media is spent liaising with partners and collaborating and supporting operations,\" the email continued. \"We will lose this time if we do not have a social media tool and will revert to scrolling through social media looking for concerning posts.\"\n\nBut civil libertarians have routinely cautioned against the use of automated social media surveillance tools not just because they place nonviolent, constitutionally protected speech under suspicion, but also for their potential to draw undue scrutiny to posts that represent no threat whatsoever.\n\nWhile tools like ZeroFox and Dataminr may indeed spare FBI analysts from poring over timelines, the company's in-house definition of what posts are relevant or constitute a \"threat\" can be immensely broad. Dataminr has monitored the social media usage of people and communities of color based on law enforcement biases and stereotypes .\n\nA May report by The Intercept also revealed that the U.S. Marshals Service's contract with Dataminr had the company relaying not only information about peaceful abortion rights protests, but also web content that had no apparent law enforcement relevance whatsoever, including criticism of the Met Gala and jokes about Donald Trump's weight.\n\nThe FBI email closes noting that \"Dataminr is user friendly and does not require an expertise in social media exploitation.\" But that same user-friendliness can lead government agencies to rely heavily on the company's designations of what is important or what constitutes a threat.\n\nThe dependence is mutual. In its Securities and Exchange Commission filing , ZeroFox says that \"one U.S. government customer accounts for a substantial portion\" of its revenue.\n\nAdditional reporting by Sam Biddle.\n\nWAIT!

History Suggests It Will Go Much Further.\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe Movement for Black Lives says, \"We seek not reform but transformation.\" Here's what that would mean.\n\nA protestor waves an American flag with the words \"Black Lives Matter\" painted on it during a Juneteenth rally at Cadman Plaza on June 19, 2020, in the Brooklyn borough of New York City.\n\nHuge numbers of Americans have been brutalized physically, emotionally, or financially by the coronavirus pandemic. And as the number of diagnosed cases trends ominously up, we have no idea what's next. Everyone with eyes to see knows the path that brought the United States to this dreadful place is a dead end. The question is whether America can change enough to head anywhere else.\n\nThe most promising direction isn't well-known outside of activist circles. In 2016 the Movement for Black Lives, made up of dozens of Black-led organizations, issued a six-part platform called \"A Vision for Black Lives.\" The introduction stated , \"Neither our grievances nor our solutions are limited to the police killing of our people,\" and much of it is devoted to economic issues. This year the MBL also released specific policy demands in response to Covid-19.\n\nWe're independent of corporate interests - and powered by members. Join us.

Some who joined a movement because they hoped for comparatively modest reforms will find themselves bumping up against the limits of the current system, and learn from experience that everything has to change or very little will.\n\nAlready BLM has put on the table the concept of a redirection of public money from policing to health care, housing, schools, and jobs. But as of 2017, state and local governments - responsible for the great majority of expenditures on police and corrections - spent just $194 billion on them. This sounds like a lot of money, but it's less than 1 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product, and only one-fifth of the $1 trillion the U.S. spends on Medicare and Medicaid. Even if somehow all of that $194 billion were shifted to different uses, it wouldn't be enough for deep social change.\n\nWhile it's largely been forgotten now - on purpose - the civil rights movement during the 1960s faced a similar reality, and confronted it head-on. Because of this, the movement was never just about ending America's legal caste system; it always had a powerful economic component. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered the \"I Have a Dream\" speech at a 1963 rally that was officially named the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. One common sign at the march was \"Civil Rights Plus Full Employment Equals Freedom.\"\n\nAfter passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, King stated that they were the \"first phase\" of the civil rights movement, and the time had come for a \"second phase\" focused on economic equality. He helped promote a Federal Freedom Budget for All Americans , which called to \"wipe out poverty in a decade\" via universal health care, a government jobs guarantee, and much more.\n\nIn a famous 1967 speech , King was clear about what would be required to get decent lives for African Americans: \"We must honestly face the fact that the movement must address itself to the question of restructuring the whole of American society. ... The problem of racism, the problem of economic exploitation, and the problem of war are all tied together. These are the triple evils that are interrelated.\" When King was assassinated the next year, he was planning to lead a Poor People's Campaign to Washington, D.C., to get results via direct action.\n\nAmerica then successfully evaded and beat back these questions for 50 years. But they didn't disappear, they stayed right here. Now the coronavirus pandemic has simultaneously demonstrated how high the stakes are, and that all of society's supposedly iron-clad rules can be thrown out at a moment's notice. If there ever were a time when Americans might be ready to rewrite the basic handbook, it's now.\n\nThe MBL is currently revising and expanding all of the Vision for Black Lives platform , but here's where things stand now.\n\nThe first plank is called \"End the War on Black People.\" Among other things, it demands the demilitarization of law enforcement, an end to the death penalty, an end to the war on drugs, and an end to people with criminal histories being excluded from housing, education, and employment.\n\nThe second plank calls for reparations from \"the government, responsible corporations and other institutions that have profited off of the harm they have inflicted on Black people.\" It lists reparations in the form of free public college and a guaranteed minimum income for Black people, and mandated changes to public school curriculums to examine \"the social impacts of colonialism and slavery.\"\n\nThe third plank , \"Invest-Divest,\" demands a reallocation of public money from policing, incarceration, and the national military to, among other things, education, local restorative justice, and universal health care.\n\nThe fourth plank , \"Economic Justice,\" calls for a progressive restructuring of the tax code, federal and state job programs targeted at marginalized Black people, the restoration of the Glass-Steagall Act , and the right for workers in both the public and private sectors to organize unions.\n\nThe fifth plank, \" Community Control ,\" demands local control of law enforcement and schools. It also calls for participatory budgeting , an invention of the Brazilian Workers' Party, in which regular people directly debate how portions of government money are spent.\n\nThe sixth plank, \" Political Power ,\" calls for the release of political prisoners, public financing of elections, and protection of voting rights.\n\nThen there's the MBL's specific platform on Covid-19 policy, filled with so many obvious, lifesaving ideas that it's excruciating to realize none will be executed anytime soon.\n\nInstituting all or even some of these policies would transform the United States. In fact, the MBL platform acknowledges \"we seek not reform but transformation.\" Countries, like people, can sometimes change significantly. It generally happens when their current existence becomes too painful to endure. What we'll find out now is whether America has gotten to that point.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

Here's What Is Wrong With \"Black Lists\" - and What Is Good.\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nWe are in the era of Black Lives Matter, but anti-racism books should not hold value only in relation to troubled times.\n\nI am a book whisperer.\n\nAs someone who reads ravenously for pleasure, and critiques books and culture for a living, I have an inbox full of requests for learning recommendations. When Donald Trump was elected president, and when white nationalists stormed Charlottesville, the bewilderment of white people provoked a staggering demand for reading guidance.\n\nWith nationwide protests under the banner of Black Lives Matter, books are helping white people understand how they found themselves bulleted and tear-gassed while demonstrating their racial solidarity, or why they suddenly appreciate the do-or-die racial stakes of this election. Appetites to read more, and inquiries to form new reading diets, are proliferating madly. People who are badly shaken, and caught off guard by social change, want to make sense of themselves, others, and so many human divides.\n\nThere are nuances and range as to what motivates any given white person to launch a reading regimen on race. The last week of May, when the protests began, I talked to a white friend nursing his wounds from the rubber bullets he was struck by, courtesy of the Seattle Police Department. I fielded another message from an unemployed white friend urgently asking me to help him populate a Google Doc with every activist contact I know, so that he could help arrange legal and financial help for them as they hit the streets of Minneapolis. And then there were several privileged white acquaintances leaving me voice messages just to say how sad, ashamed, or lame they felt. This conflagration of grit, of action, of bewilderment, of sentimental guilt - it provokes a wide, multifaceted desire for books that can help a person digest the current moment and the uncharted future. White people are going through a lot of experiences and emotions, and many of them want good books.\n\nWe're independent of corporate interests - and powered by members. Join us.

Legacy media , hip digital outlets , bookstores , nonprofits, podcasters, and, of course, celebrities, are issuing what I call \"Black Lists.\" Little wonder that books about race, blackness, and racism are dominating bestsellers lists . These \"Black Lists\" are crowded with a worthwhile but limited line-up of popular and ubiquitous usual suspects: Ta-Nehisi Coates' \"Between the World and Me,\" Robin DiAngelo's \"White Fragility,\" and Ibram X. Kendi's \"How to Be an Anti-Racist,\" for example.\n\nThere is often an implied hunger in the requests for book and film recommendations, one that yearns for a pornographic orgy of Black suffering or for valiant, magical Black heroes, or for neat resolutions that leave white people feeling better about themselves. These clichés then subsume the quality of the thing. The yearnings for \"Black Lists\" remind me of the time last week when an earnest white person called to offer the most patronizing and redundant rant on how paralyzing racism must be for me. Once I hung up the phone, I continued helping friends cook the most wondrous duck l'orange medallions followed by an enchanted patio dinner full of my dear and unruly friends of different races debating and cracking bawdy jokes.\n\nYes, there is joy to be cultivated in resistance and in even the most difficult times. No Black person wants to be reduced to a hologram of suffering, nor rendered into a kind of charity case. It's as though the entirety of your humanity could be summed up by the unrelenting news images of bloodied Black bodies. In short, you come to exist as a marginal refraction of your enemy and the centrality of his ignorance.  And that's the quicksand that books by Black authors can disappear into: the indignity that they hold value relative only to a troubled time, to a token task, to a fickle or patronizing white audience. What Black author wants to have invested her life force into a book, only to discover it has been conscripted into a kind of therapeutic how-to manual every time protests or white guilt break out?\n\nAnother irritation: The proliferation of \"Black Lists\" renders a rich repository of intellectual labor into the equivalent of a trash heap of algorithms. Amazon uses its A9 algorithm system to decide how products are ranked in user search results. That system is similar to the algorithm which Google uses for its search results, because both consider keywords in deciding which pages to display first. However, there is a key difference: Amazon's A9 algorithm also puts a strong emphasis on sales conversions. Amazon, which makes money only when it entices you to buy something, has a vested interest in promoting listings which are more likely to result in sales.\n\nIt's difficult to know, in the typical chicken-and-egg conundrum, the extent to which Amazon is driving the public discussion on race, or our public debate is driving Amazon sales. Are the \"Black Lists\" pushing traffic on Amazon to particular books, and then those books pick up steam through the Amazon algorithm and get even more prominence? Or are loafing critics and readers cribbing from Amazon? At any rate, the online behemoth continues to hawk products by prioritizing them according to strong sales history and high conversion rates. The tyranny of the algorithm worsens our collective mental sloth where race is concerned. This mixture of culture, publishing, and code conflates traffic analytics with quality, and algorithmic recommendations with urgency.\n\nIf you doubt for a second the horror of this computational taste-making, just consider the fact that \"The Help\" became the most popular streamed film on Netflix the very week that anti-racist protests erupted. That's the film precisely least helpful to this moment. \"The Help\" chronicles a white woman's quest to document the plight of Black maids in 1960s Jackson, Mississippi. To lose oneself in that perverse fantasy is to deflect rather neatly that so many corporations and white individuals are indifferent to the plight of Black maids and essential workers right now. One of the silliest movies on race ever made, \"The Help\" flounders in white savior mythology, all the while implying that segregation and racism have been safely contained into the past.\n\nAnother way these lists can fail us: Americans often want to talk about feelings and not about how economics work. Capitalism and its failings are a third-rail topic in so many American history books, particularly concerning race. It's as though racism could be boiled down to just a matter of sour interpersonal relationships, and not also as a government-sanctioned, corporate-facilitated economic exploitation of one race by another, dating from slavery to current home health care assistance . Capitalism's racial character disappears from the mix. Idiotic movies like \"The Green Book\" and \"The Help\" calcify this mindset, and mirror the economic and structural analysis absent from so many nonfiction books.\n\nIn vexed times like now, a ripe teachable moment gets wasted on such a bad curriculum. And perfectly fine culture can go squandered on an unfitting recipient. As when offering any recommendation, the question begs, Am I frittering my time? Some people are lazy readers, and even lazier citizens, so what's the point of nudging them in any direction? You have a sixth sense that asking them to read \"Giovanni's Room\" or to help register voters is setting a cost far higher than they're willing to bear. Or, as critic Lauren Michele Jackson dryly noted : Good literature is wasted on the type of white person who seeks it out only in a time of crisis.\n\nCreativity radiates always - beyond corporate media's spotlight and in unexpected nooks. Recite the cadences of a Claudia Rankine poem, or study the fiery, bright brushstrokes of Black Lives Matter graffiti art plastering a Confederate statue in Richmond, Virginia: Those stirring expressions can leave you regretting how long so many white institutions have suppressed the Black excellence and creativity that white people couldn't dance to or watch on TV. So much Black creative output has been relegated to the shadows, by school boards, by production studios, by media conglomerates like Condé Nast , by fine art galleries, by literary festivals, and yet white people can't seem to get enough of us singing and dancing.\n\nPolitical and creative false choices dog this country: that books by Black people or about race are for didactic purposes only, separate from the demands of form, poetics, genius, and even delight. And so, as an antidote to all the political falsehoods, consumer pitfalls, and creative lapses that plague so many \"Black Lists,\" I bind a list that is restorative, not draining, one that centers Black excellence and joy.\n\n\"The Light of the World\" by Elizabeth Alexander\n\nA memoir of widowhood and the consolation of caring for two teenage sons, this gem illuminates \"the jagged path\" - of history, living, thinking, and writing. Alexander's meditation is an inspiring object lesson in the kind of perseverance that is necessary when craft, storytelling, and insight take flight in a book and in a life, which happen to be Black. Trauma, loss, rewrites, grit: As James Baldwin once said , finding ourselves in deep waters is not the same as drowning.\n\n\"The Sellout\" by Paul Beatty\n\nShrewdly observed and over-the-top, this novel presents a rollicking story narrated by a Black Angeleno, simply referred to as \"Me\" and \"Bon bon.\" Quick-paced and bitingly funny, \"The Sellout\" takes on sacred precepts of American life in quiet, plausible ways: the Constitution, civil rights, segregation, father-son relationships.\n\n\"Menace II Society\" directed by Allen and Albert Hughes\n\nA chilling period piece depicting South Central Los Angeles of the 1990s. Filmed in a jerky cinéma vérité style, the film delivers an uncompromising close-up of Black teenagers navigating their intimate lives in a descent of violence. It's a wholly original coming-of-age narrative laced with an homage to Brian De Palma's \"Scarface.\"\n\n\"The Ways of White Folks\" by Langston Hughes\n\nA short story collection populated by timeless characters in comic and dark predicaments. Its charm is so pleasurable and effortless, you wind up learning despite enjoying yourself - about the collisions between Black and white people, and about concepts that would be named decades later: passive aggression, white fragility, and the like. The sharply observed vignettes emerge lyrically from this poet, one of the most important visionaries of the Harlem Renaissance.\n\n\"Beloved\" by Toni Morrison\n\nSometimes a wise person - a mystic - tries to teach you something, but you're too thick to get it until years and years later. Worth reading multiple times, \"Beloved\" weaves an unparalleled story of parental love and duty, of loss, of canny resilience. In form and story, \"Beloved\" is the novel that whispers most beautifully on the legacy of slavery on Black families and white society, on the redemption of creativity and excellence, and even on how this nation remains so violent and fragmented.\n\n\"How Can We Win?\" from David Jones and Kimberly Jones\n\nDuring the protests, photographer David Jones captured author Kimberly Jones's riff on American history. Her blunt, crisp take - and the protest themselves - shows America why we can't \"Talent Tenth\" our way out of this mess.\n\nThis article was supported by the journalism nonprofit the Economic Hardship Reporting Project .\n\nCorrection: July 6, 2020, 10:00 a.m. ET\n\nAn earlier version of this story previously misidentified the director of \"Scarface.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Police Surveilled George Floyd Protests With Help From Twitter-Affiliated Startup Dataminr\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nArtificial intelligence firm Dataminr is making questionable use of its Twitter firehose privileges - and not for the first time.\n\nLeveraging close ties to Twitter , controversial artificial intelligence startup Dataminr helped law enforcement digitally monitor the protests that swept the country following the killing of George Floyd, tipping off police to social media posts with the latest whereabouts and actions of demonstrators, according to documents reviewed by The Intercept and a source with direct knowledge of the matter.\n\nThe monitoring seems at odds with claims from both Twitter and Dataminr that neither company would engage in or facilitate domestic surveillance following a string of 2016 controversies. Twitter, up until recently a longtime investor in Dataminr alongside the CIA, provides the company with full access to a content stream known as the \"firehose\" - a rare privilege among tech firms and one that lets Dataminr, recently valued at over $1.8 billion, scan every public tweet as soon as its author hits send. Both companies denied that the protest monitoring meets the definition of surveillance.\n\nDataminr helps newsrooms, corporations, and governments around the world track crises with superhuman speed as they unfold across social media and the wider web. Through a combination of people and software, the company alerts organizations to chatter around global crises - wars, shootings, riots, disasters, and so forth - so that they'll have a competitive edge as news is breaking. But the meaning of that competitive edge, the supercharged ability to filter out important events from the noise of hundreds of millions of tweets and posts across social media, will vary drastically based on the customer; the agenda of a newspaper using Dataminr to inform its breaking news coverage won't be the same as the agendas of a bank or the FBI. It's this latter category of Dataminr's business, lucrative government work, that's had the firm on the defensive in recent years.\n\nIn 2016, Twitter was forced to reckon with multiple reports that its platform was being used to enable domestic surveillance, including a Wall Street Journal report on Dataminr's collaboration with American spy agencies in May; an American Civil Liberties Union report on Geofeedia , a Dataminr competitor, in October; and another ACLU investigation into Dataminr's federal police surveillance work in December. The company sought to assure the public that attempts to monitor its users for purposes of surveillance were strictly forbidden under its rules, and that any violators would be kicked off the platform. For example, then-VP Chris Moody wrote in a company blog post that \"using Twitter's Public APIs or data products to track or profile protesters and activists is absolutely unacceptable and prohibited.\" In a letter to the ACLU, Twitter public policy chief Colin Crowell similarly wrote that \"the use of Twitter data for surveillance is strictly prohibited\" and that \"Datatminr's product does not provide any government customers with ... any form of surveillance.\"\n\nTwitter also said that Dataminr, one of its \" official partners ,\" would \" no longer support direct access by fusion centers \" to information such as tweet locations; fusion centers are controversial facilities dedicated to sharing intelligence between the federal government and local police. Dataminr at the same time announced it would no longer provide a product for conducting geospatial analysis \" to those supporting first reponse \" and added that such clients did not have \"direct firehose access.\"\n\nBut based on interviews, public records requests, and company documents reviewed by The Intercept, Dataminr continues to enable what is essentially surveillance by U.S. law enforcement entities, contradicting its earlier assurances to the contrary, even if it remains within some of the narrow technical boundaries it outlined four years ago, like not providing direct firehose access, tweet geolocations, or certain access to fusion centers.\n\nDataminr relayed tweets and other social media content about the George Floyd and Black Lives Matter protests directly to police, apparently across the country. In so doing, it used to great effect its privileged access to Twitter data - despite current terms of service that explicitly bar software developers \"from tracking, alerting, or monitoring sensitive events (such as protests, rallies, or community organizing meetings)\" via Twitter.\n\nRelated Law Enforcement Scoured Protester Communications and Exaggerated Threats to Minneapolis Cops, Leaked Documents Show\n\nAnd despite Dataminr's claims that its law enforcement service merely \"delivers breaking news alerts on emergency events, such as natural disasters, fires, explosions and shootings,\" as a company spokesperson told The Intercept for a previous report , the company has facilitated the surveillance of recent protests, including nonviolent activity, siphoning vast amounts of social media data from across the web and converting it into tidy police intelligence packages.\n\nDataminr's Black Lives Matter protest surveillance included persistent monitoring of social media to tip off police to the locations and activities of protests, developments within specific rallies, as well as instances of alleged \"looting\" and other property damage. According to the source with direct knowledge of Dataminr's protest monitoring, the company and Twitter's past claims that they don't condone or enable surveillance are \"bullshit,\" relying on a deliberately narrowed definition. \"It's true Dataminr doesn't specifically track protesters and activists individually, but at the request of the police they are tracking protests, and therefore protesters,\" this source explained.\n\nAccording to internal materials reviewed by The Intercept, Dataminr meticulously tracked not only ongoing protests, but kept comprehensive records of upcoming anti-police violence rallies in cities across the country to help its staff organize their monitoring efforts, including events' expected time and starting location within those cities. A protest schedule seen by The Intercept shows Dataminr was explicitly surveilling dozens of protests big and small, from Detroit and Brooklyn to York, Pennsylvania, and Hampton Roads, Virginia.\n\nCompany documents also show the firm instructed members of its staff to look for instances of \"lethal force used against protesters by police or vice-versa,\" \"property damage,\" \"widespread arson or looting against government or commercial infrastructure,\" \"new instances of officer-involved shootings or death with potential interpretation of racial bias,\" and occasions when a \"violent protests spreads to new major American city.\" Staff were also specifically monitoring social media for posts about \"Officers involved in Floyd's death\" - all of which would be forwarded to Dataminr's governmental customers through a service named \"First Alert.\"\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nThe Dataminr documents on protest monitoring seen by The Intercept do not specify if they are used for news clients, police clients, or both. But a Dataminr document from October 2019 listed within the company's \"law enforcement footprint\" the New York Police Department, Los Angeles Police Department, Chicago Police Department, and Louisiana State Police. The LAPD told The Intercept it conducted a trial of Dataminr but chose not to enter a contract and did not use the system in connection with BLM protests. The Louisiana State Police declined to comment, citing a state secrecy law. NYPD did not comment and CPD could not be reached for comment. In January 2019, a New York court ordered the NYPD to turn over records about its use of Dataminr resulting from a New York Civil Liberties Union lawsuit over alleged surveillance of Black Lives Matter activists.\n\n\"Dataminr is providing information for local police, including [many] metropolitan police departments in cities facing protests,\" the source said. \"They are some of Dataminr's biggest clients and they set the agenda.\" Dataminr spokesperson Kerry McGee declined to comment on the company's clientele.\n\nAnd Dataminr alert emails sent to the Minneapolis Police Department, obtained via a public records request, show the company collected, bundled, and captioned Twitter content relevant to the anti-police brutality protests and forwarded it directly to police as these events unfolded, including information on apparently nonviolent protests. The emails show Dataminr relaying the locations and images of Black Lives Matter protesters in the city where George Floyd lived and was killed, and where the nationwide wave of outrage against police abuse was launched, a fact difficult to square with the company's claim that it doesn't provide its governmental customers with \"any form of surveillance.\" The location information in the alerts underline that while Dataminr may not technically have direct access to the geolocational data attached to many tweets by Twitter, the texts and images of the tweets relayed to the police often contain overt geographical references, or have such references added manually by Dataminr staff.\n\nWhile some of the alerts are sourced from the tweets of local and national news reporters, many are attributed to the accounts of ordinary bystanders - what the system calls \"eyewitnesses\" - who were either watching or attending the rallies and tweeting in a completely personal capacity. In one First Alert message relayed to the MPD on May 31, six days after Floyd's murder, Dataminr alerted police to a tweet reading \"peaceful protest outside US Bank Stadium in downtown Minneapolis. End racism. End police brutality. End inequality and inequities. #JusticeForFloyd #Minneapolisprotest #BlackLivesMatters,\" along with a photo snapped by the tweeter. The accompanying caption, provided by Dataminr's human staff, specified that this group of protesters had been \"seen at US Bank Stadium on 400 block of Chicago Avenue.\" Another First Alert notification sent to the MPD three days prior tipped off police to this supposed public safety threat: \"Protesters seen sitting on street in front of security officers in Oakdale, MN.\" Another monitored tweet and accompanying photo relayed to MPD by Dataminr reads, simply, \"Peaceful protest at Lake & Lyndale.\"\n\nFirst Alert also scans other popular platforms like Snapchat and Facebook, the latter being particularly useful for protest organizers trying to rapidly mobilize their communities. On at least one occasion, according to MPD records, Dataminr was able to point police to a protest's Facebook event page before it had begun.\n\nSome of Dataminr's alerts passed along dubious information. For example, on May 28, the company passed along a discredited claim about billionaire philanthropist George Soros, informing the MPD that \"Commentator Candace Owens claims Minneapolis, MN chief of police says many protesters are not from the city and claims investor George Soros is funding protesters through Open Society Foundation.\"\n\nThis apparently glaring contradiction by Dataminr, still publicly claiming it would never engage in surveillance while simultaneously facilitating the surveillance of  protests, hasn't been lost on the company's staff. At a virtual staff meeting in June, a recording of which was obtained by The Intercept, a Dataminr manager attempted to explain why the company's persistent monitoring of First Amendment activity on behalf of the police was not, in fact, surveillance. The manager, identified by the source as executive vice president Jason Wilcox, granted that there were likely Dataminr staff pondering some difficult questions: \"How does our technology, how does our company, how does our platform, play in these types of unfolding events that are out there?\" - an allusion to the nationwide protests that were by then in their heady first week. \"We sell to law enforcement. What does that mean?\" Wilcox's defense of Dataminr was based mostly on a sort of linguistic distinction: that relaying data to the police isn't a form of surveillance, but a form of ideologically neutral newsgathering. In an alternate euphemism, Wilcox described the surveillance alerts forwarded to police as \"situational awareness through real time events, [in] many of which people's lives are at stake, and they can respond more quickly and save lives.\"\n\nThis is generally the same reason Twitter and Dataminr's PR teams describe this governmental product as a source of \"news alerts,\" not intelligence - a rationale that largely obscures the major differences between what, say, a newspaper might do with rapidly updated information about a protest against policing versus what the police might want to do with that same data.\n\nDo you have a story about social media monitoring you'd like to share? Contact the author on Signal at +1 978 261 7389, via email at sam.biddle@theintercept.com , or through one of these secure channels .\n\nWilcox added that Dataminr's protest surveillance, far from presenting any chilling effect on political expression or free assembly, was a force of progressivism and reform: \"We alert on events where members of law enforcement overstep their bounds,\" Wilcox claimed. \"We found abuse of power. ... Ultimately what we're doing is we're providing a check and balance for [police]. ... Those alerts provide context to the world keeping people safe, and enabling people to do so in a way that isn't about trying to invade user privacy, but quite the opposite. It helps magnify their voice.\"\n\nAsked about the comments, Dataminr's McGee wrote, \"Dataminr does not comment on internal company meetings.\" Wilcox did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWilcox also defended Dataminr's work with police by emphasizing the firm's close ties to Twitter, the great firehose benefactor, which, according to Wilcox, \"is often one of the first social media platforms to reach out and protect privacy, they seem to be most attuned to it, they're very concerned with ensuring that their platform is not misused.\"\n\nDataminr's internal justification of its work for police also rested in part on the argument that it's not as nefarious as it could be: \"We look at lots of different companies leveraging social media, and they have often, not everyone, but often, a very different set of goals,\" Wilcox explained. \"Their goal is to help with surveillance. They build users graphs, they track users as they go across different social media platforms, they follow what a person says over time. And we do not do that.\" Wilcox named a few other mechanisms he said showed how he'd \"worked hard to ensure that our technology cannot be casually misused here,\" namely built-in limits on what keywords police can use to tailor their \"news alerts.\"\n\nBut according to the source with direct knowledge of Dataminr's protest monitoring, this is misleading: There's nothing built into First Alert that would prevent police from filtering or manually searching the intelligence they receive from Dataminr for specific terms, such as \"#BLM\" or \" antifa .\" Once a protest tweet is run through Dataminr's system and spit out the other end into a police department's inboxes, in other words, Dataminr loses control over how the information is used. This image of technological restraint also differs considerably from the pitch Dataminr gives police. An apparent 2019 Dataminr slide deck from a company presentation to the FBI, included in a recent online data dump known as \" BlueLeaks ,\" stated that \"Dataminr's mission is to integrate all publicly available data signals to create the dominant information discovery platform,\" and touted a client's ability to customize \"user-defined criteria\" for alerts like \"topic selection\" and \"geographic filters.\" The end goal: \"Reduce the time between an event and client action.\"\n\nWhen asked about Dataminr's work with law enforcement as outlined above, both Twitter and Dataminr adopted a similar defense: This isn't surveillance because we have a policy against surveillance, which therefore means we don't engage in surveillance. Neither firm would comment or discuss how exactly the above does not meet the definition of surveillance, nor would they provide the institutional definitions of such as defined by either company.\n\n\"We see a societal benefit in public Twitter data being used for news alerting, first responder support, and disaster relief,\" said Twitter spokesperson Lindsay McCallum, who added that Dataminr's First Alert tool \"is in compliance with our developer policy\" banning surveillance. \"First Alert is not permitted to be used for surveillance of any kind by First Alert users,\" Dataminr's McGee told The Intercept. In response to a screenshot copy of the tweet Dataminr forwarded to Minneapolis police regarding the exact location of a group of protesters, McGee claimed that this was flagged for the department because it showed traffic problems, not protesters. \"Alerts on an intersection being blocked are news alerts, not monitoring protests or surveillance,\" said McGee. \"A local news organization would also cover major intersections being blocked as a news story - this is not surveillance.\"\n\nBut to some surveillance scholars, legal experts, and activists, there's little doubt about what Dataminr is up to, and what Twitter is enabling, no matter what careful terminology they use. According to Brandi Collins-Dexter, a campaign director with the civil rights group Color of Change, Dataminr's practices are an example of \"if it walks like a duck and talks like a duck,\" with regards to surveillance. \"We know that law enforcement agencies spend a breathtaking amount of money to aggressively track, target, and surveil Black communities,\" said Collins-Dexter. \"Twitter can't have it both ways, courting Black activists and marketing themselves as the pre-eminent tool for organizing against injustice, while turning a blind eye to the number of companies that are contracting with them for the clear intent of surveillance.\"\n\nSteven Renderos, the executive director of civil rights group MediaJustice, echoed this sentiment. \"It's troubling that that Dataminr is providing services to police and it's flawed logic to think there's no harm in turning over Twitter posts to cops,\" said Renderos. \"The police have a history of using social media to track Black activists. Dataminr's practices is just the latest example of how tech companies are fueling racist policing in the United States.\"\n\n\"If Dataminr is sharing posts about demonstrations and protesters with police, that would be incredibly concerning and it would be difficult to understand how that practice doesn't facilitate police surveillance in violation of Twitter's own policies,\" said Matt Cagle, an attorney with the ACLU of Northern California. \"Social networks like Twitter need to protect users and ensure that developers are not sharing their First Amendment expression with law enforcement agencies, a practice that potentially exposes people - particularly Black, Indigenous, and people of color - to further surveillance and state violence.\"\n\nAndrew Ferguson, a visiting law professor at American University, rejected the companies' contention that because Dataminr only ingests public tweets, the system is only capable of news gathering - as if police snapping pictures of demonstrators would be better understood as photojournalism, not photo surveillance. \"Monitoring activities and forwarding information to police is clearly surveillance,\" explained Ferguson, author of \"The Rise of Big Data Policing: Surveillance, Race, and the Future of Law Enforcement.\" \"If the police were a data-based advertising company we would say this was consumer surveillance. If the police were tracking protestors directly we would call it government surveillance. A forwarding of the same information and calling it 'news' is still surveillance.\"\n\nWhether Twitter's hundreds of millions of users will buy the argument that automatically relaying tweets to the police is mere innocent newsgathering remains an open question, but for most of them a moot one: Outside of laborious public records requests, it's hard to imagine how someone could learn if their protest tweets were swallowed into the algorithms by a government contractor. Or, one could think of it the way Jason Wilcox urged his staff: \"All those voices, where we get to amplify that for everybody. ... It's pretty impressive. It's an amazing event.\"\n\nWAIT!

By activist standards, he was an old-timer: pushing 50 as he swaggered through crowds of teens and 20-something protesters, a cigar clamped in his lips.\n\n\"I didn't know much about him, but he drove a hearse,\" said Zebbodios \"Zebb\" Hall, a Black activist in Denver. \"Inside this hearse was a lot of guns: AR-15s and all other kinds of shit.\"\n\nThe driver of the hearse filled with guns was Michael Adam Windecker II. He went by the nickname Mickey and boasted of having been a soldier for the French Foreign Legion and the Peshmerga, the Kurdish fighting force known most recently for battling the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. He claimed to have traveled to those battlefields and trained antifascist activists there in weapons, hand-to-hand combat, and explosives.\n\n\"He was just this badass dude talking about how he worked in a foreign military and how he was for the Black Lives Matter movement,\" Hall remembered.\n\nDenver was a hot spot during the summer of 2020, with protesters enraged not just by George Floyd's killing in Minneapolis but also by the senseless death of Elijah McClain, who was forcefully subdued by police in 2019 in Aurora, a Denver suburb, and injected with a lethal dose of ketamine .\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nTrey Quinn, a muscular Black activist with a beard and large-framed glasses, led some Denver protests. One night, after Quinn had addressed a group of demonstrators, several young activists introduced him to Windecker.\n\n\"Hey, this guy's really, really dope. He's legit. He knows his shit,\" Quinn remembered being told by the fresh-faced activists. \"You should let him sit in, and he could probably help you out.\" Windecker was \"really pushy,\" Quinn told me, \"trying to put himself at the forefront.\"\n\nBryce Shelby, another Black activist, remembered seeing Windecker walking around the protests. He had a GoPro camera strapped to his chest, which Shelby initially thought was suspicious. \"He de-escalated any type of suspicion because he would start flashing his prison badge,\" Shelby said. \"So yeah. You know what I mean? OK, he's not a fed.\"\n\nBut Shelby and many other activists in Denver were wrong about the man behind the wheel of the silver hearse. Windecker was a fed. The FBI paid him tens of thousands of dollars in cash to infiltrate and spy on racial justice groups during the summer of 2020. For the last year, I've been investigating Windecker and his work for the FBI. I tell that story in detail in a new 10-episode documentary podcast, \" Alphabet Boys ,\" from Western Sound and iHeartPodcasts. As part of this investigation, I reviewed more than 300 pages of FBI reports and hours of FBI undercover recordings, as well as publicly available videos recorded by Denver demonstrators and by Windecker himself. I also examined dozens of court files related to Windecker's past and interviewed more than three dozen racial justice activists who encountered Windecker during the summer of 2020.\n\nThe FBI declined to comment on Windecker and the investigation in Denver and refused to respond in writing to a list of questions I sent.\n\nWindecker wouldn't tell me much either. After I left a note at his old apartment south of Denver explaining that I wanted to interview him about his work for the FBI, he called me. \"I do not work for the FBI,\" he said. \"I've never worked for the FBI. If you get proof of me working for the FBI, then I'll say otherwise. But there's no proof, because I didn't work for them.\"\n\nI explained that I had FBI reports and recordings to the contrary.\n\n\"I don't talk to the press, I don't talk to politicians, and I don't talk to police,\" Windecker told me, before hanging up.\n\nFBI payment receipt records signed by Windecker show that he was paid more than $20,000 for his work during the summer of 2020, when the FBI aggressively pursued racial justice and left-wing activists based on nothing more than First Amendment-protected activities. The story of the bureau's infiltration of racial justice activist groups is particularly relevant now, as House Republicans launch a new committee chaired by Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio , that seems exclusively focused on the FBI's alleged targeting of right-wing groups.\n\nThe FBI's work in Denver, with Windecker as its eyes and ears on the street, demonstrates the falsity of that narrative.\n\nWhile on the FBI payroll, Windecker became an organizer of Denver's racial justice demonstrations and ultimately undermined the social movement gaining momentum there by deploying the same controversial tactics the FBI used to devastating effect against Black political groups during the civil rights movement.\n\nUntil now, little has been revealed about the FBI's actions in the summer of 2020. The Denver undercover probe involving Windecker provides the first look behind the scenes at how the FBI viewed and investigated racial justice groups during that turbulent summer. Mickey Windecker, sitting in his silver hearse in these stills from FBI undercover video footage, infiltrated racial justice groups in Denver. Credit: FBI\n\nMickey Windecker, sitting in his silver hearse in these stills from FBI undercover video footage, infiltrated racial justice groups in Denver.\n\nAny accurate description of Windecker sounds like a cartoon. With tattoos all over his body, a scraggly goatee, garishly large rings on his fingers, and a soggy cigar in his mouth, Windecker was hard to miss as he drove the streets of the Mile High City in his silver hearse.\n\nOne rainy summer afternoon after becoming a paid informant, Windecker met with his FBI handler, Special Agent Scott Dahlstrom. The federal agent clicked on a hidden camera device.\n\n\"It is August 28, 2020, at approximately 4:02 p.m.,\" Dahlstrom said into the FBI recorder before handing it to Windecker. The video is part of more than a dozen hours of FBI recordings I obtained documenting Windecker's work investigating racial justice activists.\n\nDahlstrom asked Windecker if he remembered his tasking orders - which involved enticing a Black racial justice activist into committing a felony.\n\n\"Yep, I got it,\" Windecker said. \"Thanks, Mom. Thanks, Dad.\"\n\nWindecker walked to his silver hearse, placed the camera on the passenger seat, and started the ignition. Dahlstrom and his FBI colleagues watched the live feed from their black sedan.\n\n\"I got a song for you guys,\" Windecker said, looking into the camera lens and speaking directly to the FBI agents. He turned up the volume on the silver hearse's stereo and played \" America (Fuck Yeah!) ,\" the theme song from the puppet comedy movie \"Team America: World Police\":\n\nAmerica, America\n\nAmerica, fuck yeah!\n\nComin' again to save the motherfuckin' day, yeah\n\nAmerica, fuck yeah!\n\nFreedom is the only way, yeah\n\nTerrorists, your game is through\n\n'Cause now you have to answer to\n\nAmerica, fuck yeah!\n\nAs the song ended, Windecker turned to the camera again, as if on a stage, confident that the FBI agents were watching him.\n\n\"America,\" Windecker said.\n\nThe United States of America had become Windecker's new employer, and the FBI was paying him to spy on activists that summer day as he barreled down the road. According to internal FBI reports I obtained, Windecker began attending demonstrations in May 2020. He witnessed firsthand what millions of Americans saw on their screens at home: protests turning violent , clashes between left-wing and right-wing activists, demonstrators and instigators setting fires and vandalizing storefronts .\n\nWindecker offered to give the FBI information about protesters. In an internal report, the FBI claimed that Windecker's motivation for becoming an informant was \"to fight terrorists\" and that he believed \"people who participate in violent civil unrest are terrorists.\"\n\nIn their report adding him to the bureau's more than 15,000 informants , FBI agents described Windecker as something of a good Samaritan - a kind of volunteer Captain America. But that notion was undercut by other bureau documents, which detailed Windecker's history as both an informant and a criminal, with prior arrests in Colorado, Nevada, Texas, and Florida for crimes including sexual assault.\n\nWhen Windecker was 20, he had a sexual relationship with a 14-year-old he met at a roller skating rink. Windecker, who claimed he didn't know the girl was underage, pleaded the case down to a misdemeanor and was sentenced to 180 days in jail.\n\nIn another case, for felony menacing with a weapon in 2001, Windecker stuck a gun in a woman's face and claimed to be a police officer looking for a suspect. That incident resulted in a felony conviction, and Windecker served two years. While he was in prison, according to FBI internal reports, another inmate tried to hire him to murder someone; instead of committing the crime, Windecker became a cooperating witness and helped convict the people who'd sought to enlist him.\n\nIn addition to criminal charges, Windecker has had four protection orders filed against him in Colorado, the most recent in 2021. In a petition for a protection order filed in 2016, a friend of Windecker's alleged that Windecker had presented a fake police badge and threatened to kill him and his family.\n\nWindecker claimed to have been a fighter for the French Foreign Legion and the Peshmerga, the Kurdish fighting force in Iraq. He often said he had diplomatic immunity in the United States due to his association with the Kurds. In 2015, the Daily Beast reported that he was disliked by other volunteer Peshmerga fighters. One American fighter was reported to have described him as \" a compulsive liar .\"\n\nI spoke to several volunteers who were with Windecker in Iraq; few of them wanted to be publicly associated with him. One of those fighters told me that Windecker claimed to be a demolitions specialist. \"Dude was going around literally cutting wires off of IEDs,\" he said, referring to improvised explosive devices, also known as roadside bombs. \"So he could have gotten anybody killed in the vicinity.\"\n\nAlan Duncan, a Scottish volunteer fighter with the Peshmerga, told me that he hadn't fought with Windecker but knew his reputation from the other fighters. Windecker was better known for taking pictures with dead bodies, long after the fighting was finished, than for engaging in combat, Duncan told me. \"He was floating about taking a few photos with the Pesh,\" Duncan said. \"It's easy to claim to be Peshmerga. But claiming to be Peshmerga and actually being Peshmerga are two different things.\"\n\nCassie Windecker, Mickey Windecker's third ex-wife, told me that during one of his tours with the Peshmerga, Kurdish fighters had contacted her online to say that he was vacationing more than fighting.\n\nWhen they first started dating, she recalled, Windecker sent her a picture of thousands of dollars in cash spread over a bed. \"Do you want to come home to this every day?\" Cassie remembered Windecker asking her. She said that she never knew Windecker to hold down a job during their marriage, but he often had a lot of cash in his pockets.\n\nCassie had long suspected that her husband was secretly working for the police in some capacity. She said she'd seen him visit local police stations to meet with cops. \"Why do you have so much money?\" Cassie, who was an exotic dancer at the time, would ask him. \"I bust my ass, literally, on a pole. What are you doing?\" She told me that Windecker would never give her a straight answer.\n\nIn July 2017, after she and Windecker separated, Cassie went to the apartment they had once shared to pick up her mail. In the apartment, Windecker allegedly grabbed Cassie by the neck, slammed her down on a table, and stood over her holding a gun. Cassie screamed as she ran out of the apartment; police arrived and arrested Windecker. The responding officers were wearing body cameras, and I obtained those videos. \"He slammed me on my back, on the table, like freaking WWE-style,\" Cassie told the cops, her voice breaking with fear.\n\nWhile in jail following that arrest, Windecker revealed his talents as an informant, according to the police body camera footage.\n\n\"One of the officers said that you had to speak to me about a murder?\" the arresting officer said to Windecker, speaking through the jail cell door about two hours after the arrest.\n\n\"Well, here's the thing,\" Windecker replied matter-of-factly. He then offered information about a murder, and the arresting officer told him he'd have to talk to a detective.\n\n\"Hang tight, all right?\" the officer said as he walked away. The body camera footage then ended.\n\nWhile in the hospital for her injuries, Cassie said she received a text from Windecker: \"Hey bitch, I'm out.\"\n\nCassie said police officers were still taking her statement in the hospital when the text arrived. \"And I showed them the text, and they were just like, 'We don't know how he's out,'\" she said.\n\nThere is no record in Colorado court files of Windecker being charged, and Cassie said she was not contacted by police or prosecutors following her discharge from the hospital.\n\nThree years later, in the summer of 2020, Windecker approached the FBI, claiming to have unique information about racial justice activists.

Bowdich, compared the demonstrations to the 9/11 attacks. \"When 9/11 occurred, our folks did not quibble about whether there was danger ahead for them,\" Bowdich wrote in a memo first obtained by the New York Times. \"They ran head-on into peril.\" Bowdich described the racial justice demonstrations throughout the country as \"a national crisis\" whose \"violent protesters\" were \"highly organized.\"\n\nAgents suspected these demonstrators could fit into a domestic terrorism ideology the bureau had defined during the first year of the Trump administration as \" Black Identity Extremism \": a controversial, widely criticized catchall label for any domestic extremist ideology that drew a Black following . (The FBI has since abandoned the term in favor of a new category called \" Racially Motivated Violent Extremism ,\" which combines white supremacist violence with so-called Black Identity Extremism.)\n\nWhat's been publicly known about the federal government's activity during the summer of 2020 is astonishing: The Justice Department charged hundreds of people for their roles in First Amendment-protected demonstrations; the Department of Homeland Security deployed more than 750 agents , dressed in military-style uniforms, to Portland and abducted demonstrators in unmarked vans; and the Drug Enforcement Administration, using surveillance powers intended to stop drug runners, spied on more than 50 racial justice groups nationwide , among them a peaceful group that held a vigil on a public university campus in Florida.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nThe official position of the FBI, whose undercover activities during the summer of 2020 have been largely unknown until now, is that agents do not open investigations based on First Amendment-protected activities. \"We don't investigate ideology. We don't investigate rhetoric,\" the FBI's director, Christopher Wray, told a Senate committee in 2019. \"It doesn't matter how repugnant and how abhorrent or whatever it is.\"\n\nBut internal reports I obtained suggest otherwise. These documents show that Windecker's information was about speech, and this apparently justified hiring him as an informant and launching the undercover investigation. He reported that one local activist, Zebb Hall, used incendiary rhetoric in conversations with other demonstrators, claiming that Hall said: \"We need to burn this motherfucker down.\"\n\nWindecker also secretly recorded a conversation in which Hall spoke vaguely of violent revolution and a desire to train for combat. Windecker encouraged Hall with fantastical claims of training antifascist activists in Iraq and Syria as part of what he called the \"Red Star Brigade.\"\n\n\"My type of training that I do is anything from, like, I teach how to shoot a gun to, you know-\"\n\n\"Hand-to-hand combat?\" Hall interrupted.\n\n\"Yeah, hand-to-hand combat all the way to blowing up fucking buildings and guerrilla warfare tactics and sabotage,\" Windecker replied.\n\nWindecker, secretly working for the FBI, quickly became well-known among Denver's most committed activists.\n\n\"He came off as maybe being a [rookie], but really being into the movement,\" Brian Loma, who livestreamed many of the area's demonstrations that summer, told me.\n\nOne of Loma's videos from July 2020 shows demonstrators marching down a street in Aurora. \"Our streets!\" they chant. \"Our streets!\" Windecker's slow-moving silver hearse can be seen upfront in the video, clearing the way for the demonstrators.\n\nBy the next month, Windecker had become a leader of Denver's racial justice movement. The demonstrators had given him a nickname: Drill Sergeant.\n\nWith his military-style jacket and trademark cigar, he'd strut confidently in front of a line of demonstrators, some dressed in homemade armor.\n\n\"I can't hear you!\" Windecker would yell.\n\n\"No justice! No peace!\" the demonstrators would chant back loudly. Trey Quinn, one of the organizers of Denver's racial justice demonstrations, speaks on the steps of Denver City Hall on June 29, 2020.

Mickey Windecker and the FBI targeted Quinn as part of the undercover probe.\n\nIn 1975, a Senate committee led by the late Democratic Sen. Frank Church of Idaho investigated the FBI's civil rights-era domestic surveillance program known as COINTELPRO. Among the FBI abuses documented by the so-called Church Committee was the practice of informants becoming leaders in the organizations they were surveilling, and then accusing the real leaders of being informants themselves - a subversive technique known as \"snitch-jacketing.\"\n\nWhile COINTELPRO no longer exists, some of its methods remain inside the FBI. This is clear from the bureau's investigation of racial justice activists in Denver during the summer of 2020.\n\nAs Windecker gained prominence among the protesters, eventually rising to a leadership role, he was accusing real activists of being FBI informants. These baseless accusations sowed mistrust and undermined some of the most effective organizers in the community.\n\nTrey Quinn, the Black activist leading protests in Denver, was among the first to suspect that Windecker might be an informant. Quinn devised a way to test Windecker: Speaking in hypotheticals, he asked him about burning down a neighborhood. Could we get it done?\n\n\"And he was like, 'Oh yeah, I got the right guy for the job,'\" Quinn said. \"This is how he's talking.\"\n\nWindecker's enthusiastic response fueled Quinn's suspicions, but he didn't have proof, so he didn't warn other activists then. But Windecker, appearing to view Quinn as a threat to his cover, started telling activists that he suspected Quinn was working for the FBI.\n\n\"Mickey seemed super concerned that Trey was an informant,\" Hall said. \"Then I started getting concerns about it.\"\n\nSuddenly, Quinn found himself on the outside. His fellow activists stopped communicating with him. As Quinn was being marginalized, Windecker encouraged protesters to become more militant and go on the offensive against the police.\n\nIn late August 2020, Hall went to an apartment that served as a base for Windecker and the young allies he'd recruited. Inside, Hall saw a table covered with guns. \"I'm like, 'Holy fuck,'\" Hall recalled.\n\nAnother activist, who was with Hall in the apartment but asked not to be named because she fears retribution for speaking publicly, confirmed Hall's account. \"There are guns, weapons, medical supplies, literally looking like they're preparing for a genuine battle,\" she told me.\n\nFrom August 22 to August 29, 2020, a series of demonstrations in Denver morphed into assaults on police stations, with protesters carrying homemade shields and hurling rocks and fireworks at police. The demonstrators called one of these events \"Give 'Em Hell.\" More than 70 police officers were injured that week.\n\nThe police response was ferocious. Officers in riot gear broke bones and fired pepper balls and rubber bullets. One man was hit in the head with a lead-filled bag fired from a police shotgun. A stingball grenade exploded next to a woman, knocking out her teeth. In the first civil judgment awarded at trial for police brutality in response to protests triggered by the Floyd killing, Denver police were forced last spring to pay $14 million to 12 protesters.\n\nAccording to more than a dozen activists I spoke to in the Denver area, Windecker, the FBI's informant, helped organize and promote these protests, which quickly turned violent.

Right-wing news media reinforced and amplified that message. \"Violent young men with guns will be in charge,\" Tucker Carlson told his large audience on Fox News, adding: \"You will not want to live here when that happens.\"\n\nMichael German, a former FBI agent, watched from his home in California as this narrative took hold. \"It was frustrating for me to see how ably - usually that's not a term that you use when you're referencing former President Trump - but how ably he was able to make this boogeyman out of antifa,\" German, now a fellow with the Brennan Center for Justice's liberty and national security program, told me.\n\nAccording to FBI files and videos, Windecker's mandate from the FBI wasn't just to provide information about racial justice protesters - though his \"intelligence\" about activists filled dozens of reports - but also to try to set up protesters in a conspiracy that would have supported Trump's claims.\n\nOn orders from the FBI, Windecker targeted two Black activists: Hall, whose incendiary rhetoric Windecker had first reported to his handlers; and Bryce Shelby, a slender man with a reputation for giving fiery speeches with a rifle slung over his shoulder. Windecker invited both men to lunch in late August 2020 at a barbecue restaurant. Windecker said he'd brought them together because they were \"talking about the same shit,\" by which Windecker meant the prospect of protests turning violent. Windecker told them he had a friend - \"an outlaw biker buddy\" - who could supply whatever they needed, including weapons.\n\n\"You need to have an objective of what you're gonna do,\" Windecker told the two men. \"If Bryce is planning on like, 'OK, I want to blow up a motherfuckin' courthouse,' I need to know what the game plans are.\"\n\nBut Windecker's operation in Denver failed to generate a headline-grabbing conspiracy. Hall declined to participate in a violent plot. Windecker introduced Shelby to his supposed outlaw biker buddy - an FBI undercover agent who went by the nickname \"Red\" - and together they drove to Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser's home. As a hidden camera recorded them, the undercover agent encouraged Shelby to commit to a plot to assassinate Weiser, and even suggested they could hire a hitman for as little as $500. Still, Shelby refused to move forward with any plans and immediately cut off contact with Windecker and the undercover agent. Although Shelby was not charged with a crime, local prosecutors used the FBI's undercover recordings to convince a judge to seize Shelby's guns under Colorado's red flag law.

Photo: Trevor Aaronson\n\nZebbodios \"Zebb\" Hall was among the Denver activists who became close to Mickey Windecker, not knowing he was a paid FBI informant.\n\nA week after trying to rope Hall and Shelby into a violent plot, Windecker had drawn enough suspicion that an antifascist activist group in Colorado Springs, south of Denver, posted a Twitter thread detailing its concerns. \"Be careful around this dude,\" the group wrote on Twitter. \"Probably wise not to let him in your protest space.\"\n\nAlthough the group didn't have evidence that Windecker was an informant, the public allegation threatened to damage his cover. Activists in Colorado took the claim seriously.\n\n\"You heard through different groups: 'Kick his ass on sight.' 'Fuck him.' 'Don't let him around the groups,'\" Hall remembered.\n\nWindecker gathered his allies, including Hall, at the apartment in Denver where activists had seen the table covered with guns. Windecker wanted to record a video and post it to YouTube in response to the allegations. He created a stage for the video : a flag for the Kurdistan Workers' Party and an AR-15-style assault rifle propped against the wall behind him, and, on the table before him, a ball-peen hammer and a bottle of Jack Daniel's.\n\n\"He had a cigar and was acting all tough,\" Hall said. After an antifascist group in Colorado accused him of being an informant, Mickey Windecker posted a video response to YouTube in which he denied the accusation. \"I will be polite and professional, but I have a plan to kill everybody in the fucking room if need to be,\" Windecker threatened.

If you're trying to implicate that I'm a fucking snitch, check this out. Three things I ain't: a punk, I ain't a bitch, and I ain't a fucking snitch.\"\n\nWatching as Windecker recorded the video, Hall was struck by how defensive he seemed. He finally accepted what he'd long thought impossible: Windecker, the activist leader encouraging everyone to become more militant, must be a secret government informant.\n\nThat created a problem for Hall. Windecker had given Hall money days earlier and asked him to buy a gun. Hall had agreed and bought a Smith & Wesson handgun for Windecker, despite knowing that Windecker was a convicted felon. Hall didn't think he had a choice in the transaction. He believed that Windecker, who made the looming prospect of violence part of his identity, would come after him if he refused. \"I was just afraid of him,\" Hall explained. \"I was fucking terrified of this guy.\"\n\nAfter he made the video, Windecker and his silver hearse disappeared. In July 2021, nearly a year after he'd bought the gun for Windecker, federal agents arrested Hall. He pleaded guilty to a felony firearms violation - for buying a gun, with the government's money, for the government's informant - and received three years of probation. That was the extent of the plot Windecker and the FBI succeeded in engineering among the racial justice activists that summer.\n\nMany of the activist groups in Denver have splintered or disbanded. There was a lot of distrust. Activists there told me they suspected government agents had infiltrated the groups to encourage the violence that occurred, but until now, they'd never had proof.\n\n\"The FBI caused violence here,\" Hall said. \"They don't want people to know that.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Exclusive: Feds Regularly Monitored Black Lives Matter Since Ferguson\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has used social media to closely track activists.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has been monitoring the Black Lives Matter movement since anti-police protests erupted in Ferguson, Missouri last summer, according to hundreds of documents obtained by The Intercept through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nThe documents, released by the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Operations Coordination, indicate that the department frequently collects information, including location data, on Black Lives Matter activities from public social media accounts, including on Facebook, Twitter, and Vine, even for events expected to be peaceful. The reports confirm social media surveillance of the protest movement and ostensibly related events in the cities of Ferguson, Baltimore, Washington, DC, and New York.\n\nThey also show the department watching over gatherings that seem benign and even mundane. For example, DHS circulated information on a nationwide series of silent vigils and a DHS-funded agency planned to monitor a funk music parade and a walk to end breast cancer in the nation's capital.\n\nThe tracking of domestic protest groups and peaceful gatherings raises questions over whether DHS is chilling the exercise of First Amendment rights, and over whether the department, created in large part to combat terrorism , has allowed its mission to creep beyond the bounds of useful security activities as its annual budget has grown beyond $60 billion.\n\nThe surveillance cataloged in the DHS documents goes back to August of last year, when protests and riots broke out in Ferguson the day after the shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown. According to two August 11 th , 2014 reports, a DHS FEMA \"WatchOps officer\" used information from Twitter and Vine to monitor the riots and reproduced a map, originally created by a Reddit user, of conflict zones.\n\nThis sort of information gathering was not confined to Ferguson. A few days after rioting and protests there, a DHS email forwarded another message reporting on the \"National Moment of Silence,\" nationwide silent vigils planned in response to the shooting. The original email listed the cities with planned vigils and noted that they were being spread on social media with the hashtag #NMOS14. It also mentioned that NYPD's counterterrorism intelligence organization would be \"monitoring the situation.\" The DHS email forwarding that information said the data was provided \"for your situational awareness.\"\n\nAn April 2015 FEMA memo also shows that the DHS appears to have gathered information on anti-police-brutality protests in Philadelphia \"organized by members of the Philly Coalition for Real Justice\" and in New York on May Day at \"Foley Square, start time 1700... Independent factions are being solicited to join in on a full day of demonstration through various open source social media sites, fliers, posters.\"\n\nIn an email to The Intercept, DHS spokesman S.Y. Lee wrote: \"The Department of Homeland Security fully supports the right of individuals to exercise their First Amendment rights and does not provide resources to monitor any specific planned or spontaneous protest, rally or public gathering. The DHS National Operations Center statutory authority (Section 515 of the Homeland Security Act (6 U.S.C. § 321d(b))) is limited to providing situational awareness and establishing a common operating picture for the federal government, and for state, local, tribal governments as appropriate, in the event of a natural disaster, act of terrorism, or other man-made disaster, and ensures that critical terrorism and disaster-related information reaches government decision-makers.\"\n\nBaher Azmy, a legal director at the Center for Constitutional Rights, however, argues that this \"providing situational awareness\" is just another word for surveillance and that creating this body of knowledge about perfectly legal events is a problem in and of itself. \"What they call situational awareness is Orwellian speak for watching and intimidation,\" said Azmy. \"Over time there's a serious harm to the associational rights of the protesters and it's an effective way to chill protest movements. The average person would be less likely to go to a Black Lives Matter protest if the government is monitoring social media, Facebook, and their movements.\"\n\nAlthough Lee says in his email that the department \"does not provide resources to monitor any specific planned or spontaneous protest, rally or public gathering,\" some of the documents show that the DHS has produced minute-by-minute reports on protesters' movements in demonstrations.\n\nIn response to The Intercept 's FOIA request, for example, last month the DHS's Office of Operations Coordination released over 40 pages of documents ( archive 1 , archive 2 ) detailing live updates and Google Maps images of Black Lives Matter protestors' movements during an April 29 th protest in Washington, DC.\n\nThe \"Watch Desk\" of the DHS's National Capital Region, FEMA branch compiled this real-time information despite the fact that an FBI joint intelligence bulletin shared among several DHS officials the day before noted that there was \"no information suggesting violent behavior is planned for Washington, DC\" and that previous anti-police brutality protests in the wake of Ferguson \"have been peaceful in nature.\" The bulletin also said that for unspecified reasons \"we remain concerned that unaffiliated individuals could potentially use this event to commit acts of violence in the Chinatown area.\"\n\nThis surveillance of the April 29 th protest, which the bulletin explicitly refers to as a \"First Amendment-protected event,\" raises questions about the potentially compromised state of protesters' civil liberties - a worry that also surfaced after it was revealed in 2012 that the DHS was monitoring Occupy Wall Street.\n\n\"It is concerning that the government would be diverting resources towards surveilling citizens who are assembling and expressing their First Amendment rights,\" says Maurice Mitchell, an organizer with Blackbird, a group that helps support activism against police violence in communities across the country. \"The fact that our government is doing this - I can only assume to disrupt us - is pretty alarming... Directly after 9/11, people said, 'if you're not doing anything wrong you have nothing to worry about.' Well, now we're fighting back against police brutality and extrajudicial killings, yet they are using this supposedly anti-terrorist infrastructure against us.\"\n\nParticipants, some dressed as robots, march down T street during the annual DC Funk Parade, on May, 02, 2015 in Washington, DC.\n\nAn April 29 th email from the DHS National Operations Center also mentions planned  surveillance of three seemingly innocuous events, two of which were associated with historically black neighborhoods. According to the email, the DHS-funded DC Homeland Security & Emergency Management Agency decided to conduct \"a limited stand-up... to monitor a larger than expected Funk Parade and two other mass gathering events\" in case \"any Baltimore-related civil unrest occurs.\" It appears that the only Funk Parade in DC occurs in the historically black neighborhood of U Street. The other two events, according to another report , produced by the DHS National Capital Region 's Information Collection and Coordination Center, were a community parade in Congress Heights, a predominantly black neighborhood, and the Avon 39-Walk to End Breast Cancer.\n\nThe documents also elaborate on DHS's response to riots and militant protests in Baltimore following the death of Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old African American man who in April died from injuries sustained while in police custody. DHS deployed officers on the ground and at intelligence centers. A s VICE reported last month, the DHS' Federal Protective Service placed more than 400 officers on duty in Baltimore after Gray's death. In response to the anti-police backlash in Baltimore, DHS agencies also \"integrated\" representatives into two local intelligence centers, the Governor of Maryland's Operations Center and the Mayor's Emergency Operations Center. The documents state the DHS's Federal Protective Service and Office of Infrastructure Protection worked in \"close coordination with State and Local partners to monitor the situation\" in Baltimore and helped \"prepare for a large demonstration\" that Saturday.\n\nBrendan McQuade, a visiting assistant professor at DePaul University who researches the DHS's intelligence-gathering fusion centers, believes that the DHS and its affiliated counterterror organizations monitor Black Lives Matter to such a exacting degree because the terrorist threats they were created to stop are exceedingly remote. \"Fusion centers were set up for counterterrorism, but it became 'all crimes, all threats, all hazards' because terrorism isn't a real threat. You are four times more likely to be struck by lighting than killed by a terrorist,\" says McQuade. \"Even at their moment of emergence it was clear that counterterrorism wasn't going to be enough.\"\n\nRaven Rakia, a journalist who investigates state surveillance and policing, said that the DHS' decision to monitor Black Lives Matter is hardly surprising, given the federal government's well documented history of spying on and suppressing black social movements and groups like the Black Panthers. \"There's a long history of the federal agencies, especially the FBI, seeing black resistance organizations as a threat to national security,\" says Rakia.\n\nIndeed, the documents provided to The Intercept by DHS may well represent a small fraction of state surveillance against Black Lives Matter. Over the last few years, small bits of evidence have trickled out indicating that other counterterror intelligence organizations like the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force and state police intelligence groups have been involved in monitoring and apprehending Black Lives Matter activists.\n\nMitchell, the Blackbird activist, says that this continuing surveillance serves not only to keep tabs on black activists, but also to deter them from pushing forward. \"Surveillance is a tool of fear. When the police are videotaping you at a protest or pulling you over because you're a well known activist - all of these techniques are designed to create a chilling effect on people's organizing. This is no different. The level of surveillance, however, isn't going to stop us. After all, we organize because our lives depend on it.\"\n\nCorrection: This article originally misattributed a map of Ferguson activity to DHS. The department monitored social media activity during the protests and rioting there but the map was originally created by a Reddit user. July 24 4:10 pm ET\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "\"Go After the Troublemakers\": How Trump and Barr Targeted the Black Lives Matter Movement\n\nAnjali Kamat November 1, 2020\n\nMelquan Barnett is currently under house arrest for alleged participation in BLM protest in Erie, PA. Da'Shaunae Marisa for Reveal\n\nThis story is published in partnership with Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting .\n\nIt was Saturday, May 30, just five days after Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin squeezed the final breath out of George Floyd, digging his knee into the back of Floyd's neck for more than 9 minutes as he cried out in anguish for help. In the midst of a pandemic that had already claimed a disproportionate number of Black lives, people across the country flooded the streets to protest the national epidemic of police violence against Black communities. It wasn't just Minneapolis and large coastal cities like Los Angeles and New York that rose up in anger, but also smaller, whiter towns, some of them deep inside Trump country. Like the struggling Rust Belt town of Erie, Pennsylvania, a former industrial hub that's lost nearly two-thirds of its manufacturing jobs and a quarter of its population over the last half-century. In 2016, Donald Trump won Erie County by 2 points.\n\n\"Some might call it a little racist town,\" said Melquan Barnett, 28, who was born and raised in Erie's segregated and impoverished east side. He described a childhood marked by witnessing local police target and harass young men of color in a city where 38 percent of the Black population lives below the poverty line. \"In my experience, it's never been a good city for a Black man to be in,\" he said.\n\nWatching the video of Floyd's death sparked a deep well of anger inside him, built up, he said, over years of living in a system designed to protect those who kill unarmed Black people. \"As you know, there was many more before George Floyd,\" he said. \"We're tired of people being quiet.\"\n\nBarnett arrived downtown late that Saturday evening, just as night was falling. A crowd of people was gathered outside the Erie police station, and tensions were rising. Some protesters started banging on the main door. When somebody threw a rock at the window, a SWAT team emerged.\n\n\"It was like a movie,\" Barnett said, describing police \"kitted up like they were about to go to war,\" attacking protesters with tear gas and mace. One widely shared video from that night shows police kicking a young white woman who refused an order to disperse.\n\n\"You keep pushing somebody, eventually something's going to happen,\" Barnett said. \"They're going to stand up for themselves.\"\n\nA few blocks away, Ember+Forge, a high-end coffee shop, occupies the space of a former candle factory. The space and the name both invoke Erie's lost manufacturing past, as well as owner Hannah Kirby's vision for helping revitalize the city's battered economy. The night of the protest, Kirby was at home with her husband and two dogs, hearing about the demonstrations secondhand from one of her employees. \"She said it was so beautiful,\" Kirby said. \"A community coming together. It just felt really, really powerful.\"\n\nKirby, 32, was drifting off to sleep when her employee called again. There was a fire inside the coffee shop, the employee said. People were sharing videos of the fire on social media. Kirby found one shot from the street, so she couldn't see anyone's faces. But she could make out an ominous orange glow behind the shattered windows.\n\nHannah Kirby is the owner of Ember+Forge coffee shop on 400 State Street in downtown Erie.\n\nDa'Shaunae Marisa/Reveal\n\n\"Certainly, in that moment, that was gut wrenching, because in my brain, you know, that's it, right? The building is going to go up!\" Kirby said.\n\nImages flashing across her TV screen showed lines of police in riot gear standing at the intersection outside her coffee shop. Local news reports described scenes of chaos with demonstrators throwing fireworks and police deploying tear gas. Kirby panicked as she imagined having to close down for good.\n\nJust after midnight, the city put out a statement on Twitter: \"The peaceful protest in downtown Erie has turned into a riot. The situation has escalated, and we are in a state of emergency. Do not go downtown.\"\n\nThat Saturday night was the first time Barnett had ever gone to a protest. A self-described family man, he used to spend his spare time hanging out with his two sons, 6 and 9; coaching his younger son's football team; and when he could, he said with a laugh, baking desserts like banana pudding cake and strawberry cake for the elderly ladies in the neighborhood.\n\nBarnett had been working as a forklift operator when he was laid off last year. He'd been looking for similar jobs with little luck, and then COVID-19 struck, and no one was hiring. At the height of the pandemic, on April 12, Barnett's ex-girlfriend, who was living in Detroit, gave birth to his first daughter. \"She was going to be the first lady of the family,\" he said, smiling. \"The whole family was excited to embrace her and bring her in.\"\n\nBut less than a month after she was born, before Barnett even had a chance to hold her, his infant daughter died.\n\nBarnett was still reeling from the loss when protests erupted over Floyd's killing. Watching the collective expressions of grief and outrage in city after city, something shifted inside him, he said. He'd never seen anything like it before, not on television and certainly not in Erie. It left him with an unshakeable feeling that history was being made-and he wanted to be part of it. For the first time in a long time, he felt inspired, even a little hopeful that things might change.\n\n\"I wanted to be out there,\" he said. \"I wanted to be a part of the peaceful protests and creating change, so when 20 years come, I can tell my kids or my grandchildren the stories, and tell them that I was a part of that.\"\n\nTwo days after Barnett joined the hundreds of thousands of people demanding a change in policing, his mother called him, panicked. The police had come by her house, looking for him. They had a warrant for his arrest.\n\n\"The flames went up and then just as quickly, it kind of died down,\" she said. \"Any damage from our side was very minimal.\"Kirby arrived at her coffee shop Sunday morning to assess the damage. She was relieved to count only three broken windows and a charred table top. Security cameras she'd received through the city appeared to show a young woman kicking through the window, a man setting alight a potted plant on a table just inside and, a few minutes later, someone else throwing the plant to the ground and stomping out the fire. She couldn't really make out anyone's faces, she said.\n\nKirby swept up the broken glass and left to get cleaning supplies. When she returned that afternoon, her landlord, who had been boarding up the windows, told her that the police had stopped by and so had someone from the FBI. \"I certainly expected our local law enforcement to gather video,\" she said, \"but I was incredibly surprised that the FBI had come.\"\n\nFBI Special Agent Valentino Cuba returned the following day to speak with Kirby. He was with another federal agent, an arson investigator from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives, or ATF. Their questions mostly centered on what Kirby considered to be obscure details about her business: Where did she get her plastic to-go cups, and did she sell store gift cards online? At the time, she thought the questions were strange: What did any of this have to do with the fire?\n\nAt a City Hall press briefing that same morning, Mayor Joe Schember discussed the damage from Saturday night. The final tally was four fires, four damaged parking meters, nearly two dozen buildings with smashed windows and some spray paint on City Hall. Then Police Chief Dan Spizarny announced that his department had identified a suspect in the Ember+Forge fire: Melquan Barnett.\n\n\"I wanted to be a part of the peaceful protests and creating change,\" Barnett said.\n\nDa'Shaunae Marisa/Reveal\n\nTwo days later, on June 3, defense attorney Charles Sunwabe was at home eating dinner when his phone rang. It was his client Melquan Barnett's mother: Would he please turn on the news? The US attorney's office for the Western District of Pennsylvania had just announced a federal arson charge against Barnett for the Ember+Forge fire.\n\n\"The First Amendment does not permit people to use a protest as cover to commit arson, destroy property or incite violence,\" US Attorney Scott W. Brady said in the press release . \"Any protestors who cross this line should know that we will use every tool at our disposal to find you and prosecute you.\"\n\nSunwabe couldn't believe what he was hearing. Barely four hours had passed since he'd accompanied Barnett to the Erie police station. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania had charged him with five felonies and a misdemeanor-including two counts of arson, rioting, criminal mischief and risking catastrophe to property-for the coffee shop fire and sent him to the Erie County Prison. Now, just four days after the protest, the federal government had issued a criminal complaint.\n\n\"I have never seen any case move this fast in my entire time here in the Western District of Pennsylvania,\" Sunwabe said.\n\nOf the 24 people the commonwealth initially charged for the disturbances in Erie on May 30, federal prosecutors took over just two cases: Barnett's in June and, a few months later, the case of another Black man, Tyvarh Nicholson, who was accused of throwing Molotov cocktails at police. Trials have begun in five of the state's cases, and in each one, the initial felony charges were downgraded in court to misdemeanors and citations for more standard protest charges such as criminal mischief and failure to disperse.\n\nFederal courts offer much less room for discretion. Like many federal crimes, arson comes with a mandatory minimum sentence, regardless of the scale of the damage. If Barnett were found guilty, he would face imprisonment for five to 20 years. \"The United States does not joke around,\" Sunwabe said.\n\nBarnett was in his cell when he found out that the state had dropped his case and the federal government was picking it up. He, too, learned it on the news, from a television set angled high on the wall. \"I'm just sitting there thinking, man, this is going to get darker and darker.\"\n\nFive days later at Barnett's detention hearing, Magistrate Judge Richard Lanzillo agreed with Assistant US Attorney Christian Trabold's argument that Barnett was a danger to society because the tabletop fire he was accused of lighting could have endangered people living in apartments above the coffee shop. Lanzillo said he had a \"very hard time accepting the characterization of this crime as anything less than very serious.\" Arson, he pointed out, \"threatens both life and property.\" Barnett's case had become part of an aggressive campaign by the Trump administration's Department of Justice to go after Black Lives Matter protesters nationwide, using a tenuous legal rationale to pursue dozens of cases related to arson, theft or property damage.\n\nBarnett was denied bond. He remained in the Erie County Prison for the remainder of the summer as the pandemic raged on.\n\nAgents from the FBI and ATF learned about the fire at Ember+Forge by watching videos posted on social media from the protests in Erie that night. \"That's where we got a lot of our information from,\" said Deputy Police Chief Mike Nolan, \"and the FBI also saw some of that activity and contacted us.\"\n\nThe FBI asked the Erie police about a couple of incidents officials had seen on video that \"met their criteria\" and said the agency would be willing to consider taking on cases of arson and anything involving an incendiary device, Nolan said. He didn't know what the FBI's criteria were, noting that \"it changes based on what their priorities are at that given time.\" Nolan said that the Erie police had a \"strong relationship\" with their federal partners but that his department had no say in which cases federal prosecutors took on.\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint against Barnett, Cuba, the FBI agent, matched the clothing and hair of the man seen lighting the fire in the Facebook Live video Kirby saw to other videos from that night posted on social media that allegedly show Barnett wearing the same clothes.\n\nThe complaint also laid out why federal prosecutors had standing: Ember+Forge is a business that engages in \"interstate commerce.\" As proof, Cuba's affidavit pointed out that Hannah Kirby sources her coffee cups from a small company in Buffalo, New York; that she sells Ember+Forge gift cards online; and that the shop has an online presence.\n\nKirby said she was speechless when she heard the news. \"We are really as local as we can be,\" she said. \"To be labeled an interstate business that really only does business within a few miles' radius is really frustrating when it's being used punitively against somebody. This is not the justice I am seeking.\"\n\nLeft: Ember+Forge, in downtown Erie, before the fire and the pandemic. Right: The coffee shop's plastic to-go cup purchased in Buffalo, New York, that gave prosecutors standing to pursue a federal arson case.\n\nMatthew Giesting/Courtesy of Ember+Forge\n\nKirby remains incredulous that Barnett is facing a federal felony charge for what she considers minimal damage. Her landlord replaced the windows, a cost she says was covered by his insurance, and a local woodworker offered to paint around the burn marks on the table and turn it into a piece of art. The FBI declined to comment, referring Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting to the US attorney's office. Brady's office sent Reveal an emailed statement saying it would \"continue to partner with the FBI, ATF, and the Erie Police Department to aggressively investigate and prosecute violent crime committed under the guise of protest.\"\n\n\"In what world is a human life worth less than anything?\" she asked. \"We're going to value 10 years of his life at less than a window or less than a tabletop that got charred?\"\n\nBarnett is one of over 340 people in at least 31 states facing federal charges coming out of the historic wave of Black Lives Matter protests over the summer. An analysis of the 319 unsealed charges by Reveal shows that Barnett's case is hardly atypical: The majority of the charges concern arson, theft or property damage.\n\nThe message to make federal cases out of protest-related vandalism came straight from Trump and the country's top law enforcement official, US Attorney General William Barr. And it came fast.\n\nAt first, the president called George Floyd's killing in Minneapolis a \" very, very sad event \" and promised that \"justice will be served.\"\n\nBut by the third night of protests, Trump had taken to Twitter to call protesters \"THUGS\" and threaten military force. \"When the looting starts, the shooting starts,\" he tweeted, parroting the infamous threat from a Florida police chief during the tumultuous civil rights era.\n\nThe following Monday, June 1, after a weekend of more than 1,200 protests, Trump held a conference call with the nation's governors during which he painted a picture of anarchy spreading across the country. He falsely claimed that all the storefronts in Los Angeles were gone and claimed that crowds had broken into stores in Philadelphia and \"nobody showed up to stop them.\"\n\n\"These are terrorists. They're looking to do bad things to our country,\" he told the governors.\n\n\"We're going to clamp down very, very strong,\" he added, \"but you've got to arrest people. You have to try people. You have to put them in jail for 10 years.\"\n\nBarr, who was also on the call, said the FBI and Justice Department would work directly with local and state law enforcement to build these cases \"to go after the troublemakers, to go after the guys who were pounding the bricks and the Molotov cocktails.\"\n\n\"We want to lean forward and charge federally anyone who violates a federal law in connection with this rioting,\" he said.\n\nThe protests were overwhelmingly peaceful. An analysis by the Crowd Counting Consortium, a collaboration led by scholars at Harvard's Kennedy School and the University of Connecticut, found that no injuries were recorded during 97.7 percent of some 7,500 demonstrations that roiled the nation during the first month after George Floyd's murder. Only 3.7 percent involved property damage, including arson and vandalism. Police were injured by protesters in just over 1 percent of them.\n\nA protester raises his hands during a demonstration over the killing of George Floyd on May 27 in Minneapolis.\n\nKerem Yucel/AFP/Getty\n\nYet within roughly two weeks, prosecutors from 36 US attorney's offices from Brooklyn to San Diego had charged and taken into federal custody 105 individuals for alleged crimes committed just during the first weekend of protests. Among their number was Melquan Barnett.\n\nWhile two of the cases related to the killing of a federal officer by members of the far-right Boogaloo movement and four related to minor injuries to police, more than  two-thirds of the cases related to theft, arson, property damage or the threat of property damage. These federal crimes included the robbery of a CVS and the looting of a liquor store. They included tossing a Molotov cocktail at an abandoned police car, hurling bricks at a police vehicle and spray-painting the words \"Y'all not tired yet?\" on the Lincoln Memorial. And they included posting messages on Snapchat and Facebook calling for rioting and looting.\n\nBarbara McQuade, former US attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, said, \"Federal resources are scarce and get used for major priorities like international terrorism, massive fraud and drug trafficking with Mexican cartels-you know, massive cases.\" Many of these protest cases struck her as \"very small potatoes\" unworthy of federal resources. But she said they speak to a national federal priority set by the attorney general.\n\nIn Erie, it took federal agents four days to go through video footage, establish that Kirby's coffee shop was an interstate business and draw up the criminal complaint against Barnett. In St. Louis, federal investigators moved even faster.\n\nOn the morning of Sunday, May 31, in the midst of that first weekend of national protests, Michael Avery was standing outside his house in Jennings, Missouri, a majority-Black suburb of St. Louis that borders Ferguson. The 29-year-old community activist had returned home from Minneapolis the previous night. He said he had gone to connect with other activists, livestream the protests and share what he learned over Facebook. Avery was with his 3-year-old daughter and his mother, getting ready to wash her car on their quiet cul-de-sac, when a line of vehicles pulled up. Several uniformed men emerged, and Avery said he figured they were coming for him because of his activism. They wanted to \"shut me up permanently,\" he said.\n\nAvery has been protesting police shootings since the night after Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson on Aug. 9, 2014. Since then, he's become known locally for his vocal opposition to police violence and as a Black man who openly carries a gun in an open carry state. Avery said he needs the gun for his volunteer work: He's the driving force behind a group called Bring Them Home Search and Rescue, which helps locate missing people in parts of St. Louis with rising homicide rates. Avery carries his weapon at protests, too, and posts those images on Facebook.\n\nAvery started livestreaming his arrest as it was underway. In the video , you can hear him asking for paperwork as the camera settles on an officer's uniform. A male voice responds, \"You don't have to see paperwork, it's been signed.\" Avery asks if he can hand his phone to his mother as he is handcuffed, and just before the officer asks his mother to turn off the phone, you can hear Avery saying, \"All I did was voice my opinion.\"\n\nThe affidavit against Avery, signed by FBI Special Agent Ryan Monahan, notes that Monahan and other investigators had been monitoring social media activity for \"evidence of imminent acts of violence\" when they came across Avery's Facebook page, where Avery had been posting live video feeds from Minneapolis. In one of his many posts, Avery called on activists in St. Louis to be available for a \"level red action\" on Saturday night: \"Calling out all the shooters, all the people who don't give AF. All the people who has had enough.\" On his way home, Avery posted a long video describing how young people in Minneapolis had carefully targeted the looting, marking off Black-owned businesses \"that were not to be touched under no circumstances.\" That Saturday night in Ferguson, as in Erie, a crowd gathered outside the local police station. Protesters smashed windows and threw rocks and bottles at police, according to the federal complaint. As these events were unfolding, Avery posted a call on Facebook: \"Red Alert everyone get to Ferguson PD right now.\"\n\nVideo still of Michael Avery from a television interview\n\nAssistant US Attorney Michael Reilly argued in court that Avery was a \"leader\" of protest movements in St. Louis and suggested that his posts on Facebook had incited violence, rioting and somehow even the killing of a police officer in a pawnshop several days later, while he was being held in the county jail-a claim Magistrate Judge Patricia Cohen shot down as \"a stretch.\" Stating that the FBI had assessed \"a level red action to be associated with a high level of violence,\" Monahan accused Avery of looting in Minnesota and providing \"tutelage\" to St. Louis activists, encouraging them to do the same. Avery was charged with using the internet, a \"facility of interstate commerce,\" to incite a riot. He was accused of violating a law pushed by segregationists as an amendment to the Civil Rights Act and most famously used against the Chicago Seven in 1968.\n\n\"His posts do carry weight,\" Reilly insisted . \"I know he was in custody, Judge, but it's possible to incite people and then, once they're incited, they're incited.\"\n\nTwo and a half weeks later, on June 17, the US attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri dismissed the complaint against Avery. The case had collapsed.\n\nJavad Khazaeli, who worked terrorism cases for over a decade at the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security, is now an immigration attorney in St. Louis and followed Avery's case closely. \"My one-word response as a former prosecutor with the federal government is 'embarrassing,' \" he said of the government's case against Avery.  \"Look at the timeline and how quickly they came down with these charges-there was no due diligence done.\"\n\nAt Avery's pretrial detention hearing on June 3, the government's attorney argued that Avery \"traveled from out of state for the sole purpose\" to incite a riot and \"had no community ties of any kind to St. Louis.\" \"A simple Google search would have proved that was wrong,\" Khazaeli said. Avery describes himself as a radical activist. But he grew up on the south side of St. Louis and runs a lawn care business in Jennings.\n\nThree longtime organizers who train activists in civil disobedience sent letters to the judge in support of Avery, explaining that among activists, a \"level red action\" indicates a high risk of arrest and a greater likelihood of police violence. \"Red does not refer to violence or destruction being done by protestors,\" wrote one of them, Lisa Fithian.\n\nAvery was shaken by his time in jail and the federal charges against him. But the experience also woke him up to something. \"They feel like my voice is strong enough to get more people on the streets,\" he said of the federal government. \"That motivates me to continue my work and take it to another level.\"\n\nThe US attorney's office that brought the case against Avery would not comment on his case but said the office had charged a total of 12 people connected to the protests, cases that all \"remain pending.\"\n\nSo far, federal prosecutors across the country have had to drop charges in at least nine cases, including Avery's.\n\nIn Avery's case, in Barnett's and in about half of the federal cases coming out of the Black Lives Matter protests, charges are grounded in the commerce clause, a constitutional principle that gives Congress the power to regulate international and interstate commerce. It also allows federal prosecutors to pursue criminal charges if a crime involves interstate commerce. Until this past summer, conservatives, including Barr, had long opposed its use, as it has undergirded a range of policies that Republicans have opposed, from labor protections during the New Deal to bans on segregation during the civil rights era and the Affordable Care Act.\n\nFederalizing protest-related prosecutions at this scale is \"extraordinary,\" said Jonathan Smith, a former Justice Department lawyer who now leads the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs. Typically, incidents like these are left to local authorities to prosecute; the protests against the World Trade Organization in the 1990s and the Occupy movement in the 2000s resulted in mass arrests, but they were handled locally. The federal government typically gets involved only if there's a high federal interest and local officials are incapable of addressing it or unwilling to do so, Smith said.\n\nThe only real precedent also came under Trump: the decision by federal prosecutors to charge 234 people, including medics, journalists and legal observers, with felony rioting out of the Washington, D.C., protests on Trump's Inauguration Day in January 2017. \"It was shocking at the time and felt like a signal of things to come,\" Smith said. Within a year and a half, the vast majority of those charges had been dropped.\n\nKristy Parker, another former Justice Department lawyer, described many of this past summer's prosecutions as \"broken-windows policing on a federal level.\" She said it would be \"impossible\" not to call this a \"very aggressive use of federal law enforcement powers.\"\n\nCertainly, the federal involvement has ruffled the feathers of some local prosecutors. In Portland, Oregon, Multnomah County District Attorney Mike Schmidt issued an official policy in August declining to prosecute cases relating \"solely to protest activities,\" including charges of rioting, disorderly conduct and interfering with officers. Calling such prosecutions a drain on \"crucially needed resources,\" Schmidt rejected nearly 70 percent of the 1,000 or so cases referred to his office by police. Meanwhile, federal prosecutors in Oregon have brought at least 97 cases against Portland demonstrators-constituting nearly a third of protest-related federal prosecutions nationwide-many of them for the very crimes the local prosecutor had refused to charge.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, US Attorney Scott Brady filed charges against 11 protesters for damaging police cars and throwing projectiles at the police-after District Attorney Stephen Zappala already had filed state charges against all of them. Zappala spokesperson Mike Manko said it was \"unclear\" why the US attorney would want to focus on \"local protest cases.\"\n\nSt. Louis Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner said there was no reason for federal prosecutors to \"inject\" themselves into cases of arson or property damage that local prosecutors could easily bring themselves. She said she views the federal prosecutions-in light of Trump and Barr's law-and-order rhetoric-as a form of political intervention into local Democratic jurisdictions. They are \"attacking prosecutors who believe in alternatives and holding Black and white people accountable, as well as police officers,\" she said.\n\nWhen her office filed felony charges against Mark and Patricia McCloskey, a white St. Louis couple who aimed their guns at peaceful demonstrators marching through their privately owned neighborhood over the summer, Gardner found herself in the middle of a political firestorm. Trump described the charges as a \"disgrace\" and his chief of staff, Mark Meadows, invited the McCloskeys to speak at the Republican National Convention.\n\nAs Black Lives Matter protests continued into late June, Barr created a task force to combat \"violent anti-government extremists,\" a designation that includes supporters of the far-right Boogaloo Bois as well as antifa, the loosely organized movement of anti-fascist activists. These individuals, Barr said in a departmentwide memo, may \"pretend to profess a message of freedom and progress, but they are in fact forces of anarchy, destruction, and coercion.\"\n\nAttorney General William Barr addresses President Donald Trump (not shown) in the Oval Office on July 15.\n\nAnna Moneymaker-Pool/Getty\n\nOf the 319 unsealed cases the Justice Department has brought against protesters, only one, against a Rochester, New York, activist accused of inciting a riot, alleges a connection to antifa. Six involve members of the Boogaloo movement.\n\nWhat is striking is how few of the unsealed cases involve allegations of bodily harm. Two individuals affiliated with the Boogaloo movement were charged with murder and attempted murder for fatally shooting one federal officer and wounding a second in Oakland, California, during protests May 29. And while 58 protesters in Portland and 16 in other cities were charged with hitting police or federal officers with such objects as explosives, water bottles, a skateboard and a beer can, officer injuries are alleged in only nine of these cases.\n\nOf the 101 arson cases, only three involved injuries-in two cases to the arsonists themselves and in the third to a Pennsylvania state trooper. There are only indications in five other cases, including Barnett's, that the fires involved buildings where people were present. Half of the arson charges relate to fires set in empty police cars.\n\nAs Barr's Justice Department pours resources into building relatively simple cases against those protesting police violence for property crimes such as looting, arson and vandalism, it has not made public a single investigation into the wave of excessive force levied against protesters-the eyes shot out , the cracked skulls-by police over the summer or into systematic civil rights abuses by police departments where officers have been accused of high-profile killings.\n\nIn fact, the administration's obsession with property damage has an ugly corollary: a tendency to prosecute those responsible for damaging cars and buildings more aggressively than those responsible for destroying Black lives.\n\nFederal prosecutors and the FBI have initiated criminal probes into the murders of George Floyd in Minneapolis and Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky, and the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, but Smith, the former Justice Department attorney, said investigating the conduct of individual officers is not enough.\n\n\"There are serious and deep problems in those departments that cannot be addressed through accountability for those individual officers, but need a fundamental and structural change in those departments,\" he said. In the recent past, the Justice Department was a factor in driving that change forward through suing departments and then negotiating consent decrees in court.\n\nWhen he was head of special litigation for the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, Smith led the civil probe into the Ferguson Police Department, which began soon after the protests following the police killing of Michael Brown. \"You could not have a greater contrast than what happened in 2014 and what's happening in 2020,\" Smith said.\n\nDuring President Barack Obama's second term, Smith's section led similar \"pattern or practice\" investigations into 14 other police departments over civil rights abuses, including in Baltimore after the in-custody death of Freddie Gray in 2015 and in Chicago after the fatal shooting of Laquan McDonald in 2014. In Trump's nearly four years in office, the section has investigated only one , in Springfield, Massachusetts.\n\nIn Erie, local activists and national civil rights groups tried for years to get the Justice Department to investigate systematic civil rights abuses by the police there. Then, in July 2016, the Justice Department opened a criminal investigation into the arrest of Montrice Bolden, who suffered facial fractures and a concussion during his arrest by Erie police. But just two months after Jeff Sessions took office as attorney general, the Justice Department closed the investigation, announcing it would not bring civil rights charges against any members of the Erie police.\n\nThe administration's focus on acts of violence by protesters has also meant turning a blind eye to widespread violence committed by police during the demonstrations. Amnesty International documented 125 cases of excessive force against demonstrators, while data from the nonprofit Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project suggests law enforcement used force against demonstrators in 460 -or nearly 1 in 20-Black Lives Matter protests. Citizen groups, using videos posted on social media, have documented many hundreds of other instances of police violence directed at protesters. In many cities, researchers from the Crowd Counting Consortium note , it was excessive force by police-the use of tear gas, pepper spray and batons; pushing into crowds on horses or in vehicles-that turned protests violent.\n\nPolice officers arrest Lorises Tercero in front of the US courthouse in downtown Los Angeles during a July 25 protest demanding justice for George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.\n\nApu Gomes/AFP/Getty\n\nInstead, at a gathering of police chiefs Oct. 16, Barr doubled down on his law-and-order message. He claimed that excessive use of force by police officers is \"relatively rare and becoming rarer\" and said \"there is no valid justification for physically resisting a police officer. The approach must be 'comply first, complain later.' \" Smith noted that the Justice Department hasn't opened a single investigation into excessive force by police this year. \"This administration has made clear its view that it is not going to hold police accountable to their constitutional obligations,\" he said.\n\n\"These are the radicals who have hijacked demonstrations,\" he said of those protesting police violence. \"These are not peaceful protesters exercising their First Amendment rights. They are criminals and thugs and must be dealt with accordingly.\"\n\n\"This wasn't a dog whistle,\" said Phillip Halpern, former assistant US attorney for the Southern District of California, who publicly resigned in October after 36 years as a federal prosecutor. \"This is the attorney general making crystal clear he wants more prosecutions for protesters.\"\n\nIn pursuing federal charges against the Black Lives Matter movement, the Justice Department is effectively seeking higher penalties for protesters than for others engaging in the same conduct. Smith calls this \"chilling\" because it implies the department is punishing people for their speech.\n\n\"It's because it happened in the context of demonstrations against police brutality and racism that the government has gotten involved, not because there's something about these particular crimes,\" he said.\n\nHalpern, too, said these prosecutions trouble him greatly. \"It augurs a widespread federalization of potential criminal activity in pursuit of a political agenda,\" he said.\n\nPortland police disperse a crowd on September 23, 2020.

(Photo by Nathan Howard/Getty)\n\nTogether with the tear-gassing of demonstrators in front of the White House on June 1, the militarized response to protests in Portland since early July and Trump's repeated threats of military intervention to quell protests in Democrat-run cities, the prosecutions are a part of the largest federal crackdown on mass protests in recent memory.On his call with governors on June 1, the president compared the protests to Occupy Wall Street and made what might be his clearest statement yet about what was driving his demand for a tough federal response. \"It's a movement,\" he said, \"that if you don't put it down, it will get worse and worse.\"\n\nThe last time a president sent federal troops to an American city was in 1992, when President George H.W. Bush invoked the Insurrection Act during the outburst of popular anger in the aftermath of the Rodney King verdict and sent 8,200 federal troops to Los Angeles. His attorney general at the time also happened to be William Barr.\n\nIn Erie, Melquan Barnett pleaded not guilty and rejected a plea offer. His application for release from pretrial detention was accepted on the last day of August, after he'd sat in jail for three months. US Attorney Scott Brady opposed his release, calling him a \"drug-using arsonist with mental health issues and a significant criminal history\" who posed a threat to society. A new judge, Susan Baxter, granted Barnett bail.\n\nBy Barnett's telling, much of his criminal record is inseparable from what it means to be a young Black man in a place like Erie. His rap sheet includes several charges that stemmed from the countless times he'd been stopped by police since he was old enough to drive-showing false identification, driving with a suspended license and possession of small amounts of drugs. \"You cannot call that significant,\" said Charles Sunwabe, Barnett's lawyer. \"None of these are serious crimes.\"\n\nBarnett's release is predicated on the condition that he remain under the strictest form of home incarceration; he is not allowed out of his mother's house except for medical emergencies or court appearances. Barnett said it's better than being in jail. But he can't sit on his front porch to catch a moment of sunlight. And the devoted coach can't step into his backyard to kick a ball around when his son visits. \"That kills me, man,\" he said.\n\nMelquan Barnett at home in Erie, PA.\n\nDa'Shaunae Marisa/Reveal\n\nNow, after spending three months in jail, he's facing down a tough court battle against some of the nation's top prosecutors and the prospect of spending several years in prison. \"Going through what I'm going through has snatched that all out of me,\" he said. Barnett said his experiences this past summer have soured his views on protesting and deepened his cynicism about the police. \"At the beginning, I was lit up with joy and happiness and inspired,\" he said, by the sheer scale and raw energy of the protests over the murder of George Floyd.\n\n\"These are political charges that the government is bringing,\" Sunwabe said. \"They're trying to make an example of people like Melquan, to silence people so they never get back on the streets.\"\n\nReveal reporter/producer Stan Alcorn contributed to this story.\n\nAnjali Kamat can be reached at akamat@revealnews.org .

      "text": "The Worst People Keep Stealing the Language of Black Struggle\n\nGabriele Holtermann/AP\n\nRecently, one of the three Black Republicans serving in Congress, Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) compared white supremacy to \"woke\" supremacy , using the term as a stand-in for a group of people he doesn't like: liberals. After being criticized in a Washington Post op-ed by Jonathan Capehart, the senator responded with his own piece, clarifying his comments. \"Woke\" supremacy was as bad as white supremacy because, according to him , \"Woke culture is speeding our country toward ideological and literal segregation.\"\n\nSome examples of this literal segregation? The COVID stimulus aid package set aside money for Black farmers after white farmers got 97 percent of agricultural subsidies in 2020, and Columbia University announced it would be holding, per custom, intimate multicultural graduation ceremonies open to all, in addition to the university-wide commencement. Of course, Scott couldn't point to real examples of how woke culture is hurtling us toward segregation because it's not true. But he doesn't need it to be true. The goal is to take a radical message and muddle it enough until it means something like its opposite.\n\nSo it goes with any message of social transformation. Wokeness becomes synonymous with oppression itself. Black Lives Matter is spun into \"blue lives matter.\" \"I can't breathe\" is adopted by anti-maskers as their smirking slogan. The mantras and catchwords of movements that challenge the status quo are co-opted by reactionaries who want to quash those efforts. They're flipped on their head, turned inside out, repurposed to sneer at the people they were meant to rally, and generally made to seem comical and ridiculous-a rhetorical minstrel act, essentially, whose theme is the old American standby that there's no greater racist than the anti-racist, no greatest tyrant than the slave who wants to be free.\n\nOnce upon a time, the notion of wakefulness would not have conjured up images of politicians complaining about college students. During the 1860 presidential election, young voters organized themselves as Wide Awakes , many of them in opposition to the spread of slavery. Those against the youth movement called themselves Chloroformers-they would put the Wide Awakes to sleep. In the 20th century, the idea of staying woke was popularized by activists who wanted people to remain ever vigilant of the threats posed by America's racial hierarchy. By 2008, Erykah Badu in her song \"Master Teacher\" was crooning, \"I have longed to stay awake / A beautiful world I'm trying to find,\" returning again and again to the refrain of \"I stay woke.\"\n\nBut now a sitting senator uses the word to demean liberals he doesn't like. Republicans refer to Black people calling out injustice as a \"woke mob.\" An outgoing conservative opinion editor and writer at the New York Times , practically dispensing with the code altogether, speaks of a \"civil war\" at the newspaper pitting older staffers against \" the (mostly young) wokes .\"\n\nPerhaps no phrase has undergone this type of distortion more prominently than the phrase \"Black Lives Matter.\" After George Zimmerman was acquitted in 2013 of shooting and killing 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Florida the year before, activists Patrisse Cullors, Alicia Garza, and Opal came up with the rallying cry. It wasn't long before protesters began chanting \"Black Lives Matter\" and holding up \"Black Lives Matter\" signs at protests for the endless list of Black lives cut short by violence. Racist whites quickly came up with a retort: \"All lives matter.\"\n\nThe \"all lives matter\" rhetoric was just the beginning of the co-optation. Today, at any right-wing gathering, you can find supporters of the \"blue lives matter\" cause (supposedly in support of police officers) and \"babies' lives matter\" (for the anti-abortion movement).\n\nAs Black Lives Matter was met with all lives matter and blue lives matter, it became increasingly clear that these phrases weren't really about equality or even about law enforcement-as demonstrated by the January 6 Capitol siege in which insurrectionists assaulted cops with pro-police flags. They were about reminding Black people of their place in society.\n\nIn 2015 New York City police officer Daniel Pantaleo put Eric Garner, a Black man, in a chokehold on a city sidewalk. As Garner died that day he repeatedly told Pantaleo, \"I can't breathe.\" The short but evocative sentence became a byword for the police brutality Black and Brown people face across the country. Five years later, with white Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on his neck, George Floyd said the same thing.\n\nBy the time Floyd was killed, the coronavirus pandemic had already begun. At the same time that Floyd's death was sparking a nationwide protest movement, public health officials were pleading with the public to wear masks-the simplest way to slow the spread of the deadly virus. Masks immediately became another flashpoint in the culture wars, and it wasn't long before the anti-maskers were appropriating the language of the movement in the streets. They, too, declared that they couldn't breathe.\n\nFor a privileged suburbanite to draw on the dying words of George Floyd and Eric Garner while throwing a temper tantrum outside a grocery store in protest of public health measures is to render the whole issue completely unserious. It equates the scourge of police brutality in communities of color with the minor inconvenience of wearing a piece of fabric on your face. And isn't that the goal? To make Black struggle seem minuscule, to the point of non-existence? To make a joke of it?\n\nChauvin has been charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter. His trial starts today. When jury selection began, potential jurors were asked questions about their feelings on Black Lives Matter, law enforcement, defunding the police, and the criminal justice system. Both the prosecution and the defense were looking for jurors who could be impartial or neutral-meaning the state didn't want anyone who opposed Black Lives Matter, and Chauvin's lawyers preferred people who generally supported police.\n\nOne juror said that when she hears \"Black Lives Matter,\" she believes the phrase meant other lives don't matter. When asked about \"blue lives matter,\" she responded with ignorance , saying she didn't realize it was about law enforcement: \"I took that to mean everybody else.\" The unnamed juror is essentially correct. Black Lives Matter was turned into blue lives matter not to profess support for police but to dilute the fight for Black lives. Saying \"blue lives matter\" is akin to responding to the chant of Black Lives Matter with, \"No, they don't.\" It is about everybody else.\n\n\"Attorneys in Derek Chauvin trial home in on key juror question: Black or Blue Lives matter?\" as one obtuse NBC News headline put it. The racial justice movement was now being equated with its racist backlash. Once again, the minstrel act had done its job.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Candace Owens Exposes Only Herself in Her BLM Documentary\n\nChris Burnett; Getty (10)\n\nEamon Whalen March+April 2023\n\nOn October 16, Kanye West appeared on the popular hip-hop podcast Drink Champs . Hosted by the rapper N.O.R.E. and DJ EFN, Drink Champs is a free-flowing interview show-think of a more convivial version of The Joe Rogan Experience but for rappers and with more booze. At its best, you'll hear a story from Ghostface Killah about how one time he drove the R&B group The Delfonics to a recording studio (and got in a shootout on the way). At its worst, you'll get one of the most popular rappers ever ranting with little pushback about \"Jewish business secrets.\"\n\nYe's Drink Champs interview was at the beginning of his current descent. On the show, he said he had been \"screwed by the Jewish media.\" He said \"Jewish Zionists\" were responsible for crude tabloid stories about the mother of his children, Kim Kardashian. He said Planned Parenthood was the Holocaust for Black America.\n\nLess discussed since then has been the other gut-wrenching claim made by Kanye West: That George Floyd was killed by a fentanyl overdose. \"They hit him with the fentanyl,\" said West. \"If you look, the guy's knee wasn't even on his neck like that.\" If you paid attention in 2021 to the trial of \"the guy,\" Derek Chauvin, you might recognize this argument. It is nearly identical to the defense proffered by the former Minneapolis cop's attorneys. But West told N.O.R.E. that he lifted them from another source: the far-right media provocateur Candace Owens' documentary, The Greatest Lie Ever Sold: George Floyd and the Rise of BLM .\n\nOwens has become a Rasputin-like figure in Ye's recent meltdown. Owens and Ye's on-again, off-again friendship goes as far back as 2018, when Kanye first donned a MAGA hat and said slavery was \"a choice.\" Before the Drink Champs episode, he appeared with Owens at Paris Fashion week wearing shirts he designed that read \"White Lives Matter.\" West was prepared to buy Owens' husband's fledgling anti-woke social media platform Parler, but the deal reportedly fell through . As of late, West has gone for the harder stuff, appearing with white supremacist Nick Fuentes on a recent media tour. But before that, he was attending the premiere of The Greatest Lie Ever Sold in Nashville, posing on the red carpet with Owens, just days before appearing on Drink Champs .\n\nCandace Owens speaks during a rally at the Ellipse before entering to the White House, where President Donald Trump will hold an event on the South lawn on October 10, 2020.\n\nJose Luis Magana/AP\n\nThere is a way of thinking that Ye is uniquely vulnerable to these delusions. This is too hopeful. The film was produced by Ben Shapiro's The Daily Wire and is the second in a series of right-wing documentaries by the company aiming to expose the evil lurking behind progressive shibboleths. The Daily Wire also produced Matt Walsh's anti-trans documentary film, What Is A Woman? As reported by the New York Times , Shapiro and The Daily Wire co-CEO, filmmaker Jeremy Boreing, aim to make Nashville a new Hollywood , but without the liberals. This is part of a larger project on the right: to create a parallel media sphere in the hope that culture-war-as-entertainment can help persuade a few more soldiers to join the fight.\n\nThese are sleek, professionally edited feature-length documentaries that make salacious claims about some of the biggest news stories of the past decade. They're ready-made to pick off those unsure of the exact facts in the flurry of the modern information environment. As the writer and filmmaker Jen Senko pointed out in the book and film, The Brainwashing of My Dad , deregulated, fragmented media channels gave rise to conservative talk radio and Fox News, and were key in radicalizing a generation of older Americans like her father-the proverbial Meemaw and Peepaw-into right-wing hysteria. As we have seen with West, it's worth admitting that many of us are closer to becoming Meemaw and Peepaw than we'd like to admit. We can't box others, and ourselves, off from the discomfort that we, too, could be deceived by the right kind of flashy agitprop. \"I was watching that Candace Owens documentary-documentaries are fucking dangerous,\" joked comedian Andrew Schulz, in a widely viewed video reacting to Owens film, about their persuasive power. \"They should be illegal.\"\n\nEven if in the film, Owens' argument-that George Floyd wasn't murdered-is thin, it will work. If you're someone who thought the Floyd protests in the summer of 2020 were untoward in some way, this film gives you a semi-coherent narrative.\n\n\"No one deserves to die,\" Owens stipulates early in the film. She then spends the next hour trying to prove that a man did.\n\nThe first thing Owens wants us to know is that she wasn't even going to make this film.\n\nA little over a week after Floyd was killed, Owens recorded a video saying she did not support the protests. She told her phone that the media depiction of Floyd as a martyr for Black America ignored his past criminal record. Then, Cenk Uygur and Ana Kasperian of The Young Turks made fun of her. Dave Chappelle called her \"a rotten bitch.\" The criticism, Owens says, motivated her to, \"scream the truth louder than you scream the lies.\"\n\nOwens is the film's star, narrating and playing the role of the intrepid reporter. The film toggles back and forth between Owens doing on-the-ground shoe leather work; interviewing different talking heads on camera; and editorializing in her own confessional, straight-to-camera monologues. Its style is reminiscent of the left-wing muckraking films of Michael Moore.\n\nOwens' mission is to exonerate Chauvin by damning Floyd. She argues that because of this \"lie\"-that Floyd was murdered-the massive nationwide protests set off in Minneapolis were a farce played on the American people. (Owens has trouble sticking with her argument, so she has a backup theory too: Floyd resisted arrest and had a criminal record-so if it wasn't the drugs, it was that.)\n\nWe hear from Ron Martinelli, a forensic criminologist who tells us that Floyd's true cause of death was a drug overdose, not asphyxiation. This goes against what pulmonologist Dr. Martin Tobin painstakingly narrated during Chauvin's trial, when he pinpointed the precise moment of Floyd's death.\n\nMartinelli, like just about every talking head in the film, is presented as a straight shooter with \"no dog in this fight,\" he says. Ignore the anti-Black Lives Matter book he published in 2016; forget that he told NPR at the time that BLM is \"a black nationalist revolutionary Marxist movement that is tied into a much larger international movement referred to as One World One Struggle.\"\n\nLike most political propaganda, The Greatest Lie Ever Sold builds its case through lies by omission. Conspiracy theories that are able to take hold rest on small kernels of truth; facts that are exploited and decontextualized.\n\nOwens spends the first section of the movie in Minneapolis, where she gets the closest thing to a scoop the film contains. She introduces us to Alvin Manago and Theresa Scott, who were George Floyd's roommates at the time of his death. (Owens admits that, in order to gain access to the couple, she and her producers intentionally kept Alvin and Theresa in the dark about what their documentary was trying to prove.)\n\nAlvin and Theresa are kind and welcoming. Alvin met Floyd at a substance abuse treatment center, and then they worked together as security at the restaurant and nightclub Conga Latin Bistro. We get a tour of Floyd's bedroom. Theresa shows the verses Floyd highlighted in his personal Bible.\n\nWe learn that a few weeks before he died, Floyd predicted his death: \"I do whatever the police tell me to do because they're looking to kill a big brother like me,\" Theresa remembers Floyd telling her.\n\n\"So when it happened, it was eerie,\" adds Alvin. \"That was one of his fears.\"\n\nFor Owens, this was the perfect moment to attempt to provoke the couple. \"I'm sure you've seen the whole tape by now,\" Owens begins a question, as the film splices into footage of Floyd's last moments. \"Do you ever look at it and go, 'man, I wish he would've taken his own advice?\"\n\nTheresa quietly answers yes.\n\nBut the film quickly cuts away before we can see more.\n\nIt is difficult to convey how disturbing it is to watch this attempt to get Floyd's roommates to blame him for his own murder.\n\nOwens did see a sympathetic figure in all of this: Derek Chauvin. She speaks with Chauvin's mother on the phone off-camera and pleads with her to participate in the film. She declines, but Owens tells us she \"felt her pain.\" She speaks with retired Minneapolis police Sergeant Joey Sandberg. He describes Chauvin as levelheaded and quirky. She talks to retired Lieutenant Kim Voss, who explains that Chauvin did not have a racist bone in his body.\n\nThis ignores almost everything we know about who Chauvin was. I n 2017 , Chauvin struck a 14-year-old boy in the head with a flashlight two times. Chauvin knelt on his back for 17 minutes as the boy's ears began to bleed. During the trial, prosecutors on Chauvin's case attempted to introduce seven other incidents where Chauvin held someone in a prone position or used a neck restraint for an unreasonably excessive amount of time. Voss, Chauvin's character witness, was a commander at the infamous Third Police Precinct, where Chauvin worked. In a story in the Minneapolis Star Tribune, a civil rights lawyer called it a \" playground for rogue cops ,\" where her clients were regularly subjected to anal-cavity searches.\n\nNone of this makes it into the film. Instead, Owens says Chauvin was unfairly maligned. From there, she reasons: If we've been misled about Chauvin, we've probably come to the wrong opinion on the Black Lives Matter movement too. We hear from former local television reporter Liz Collin and her husband, Bob Kroll, the former Minneapolis police union head. They're presented as victims of a bloodthirsty woke mob. While it's true that protesters did beat effigies of the couple outside of their house, what's missing is that Kroll is not just any cop, but perhaps the most notoriously racist cop in modern Minneapolis history. Collin, meanwhile, recently published a tell-all book in the vein of Owens' documentary, called They're Lying: The Media, The Left, and The Death of George Floyd.\n\nIn an attempt to further demonize protest, Owens is taken on a tour of the intersection where Floyd was murdered in south Minneapolis. Her guide is a minister named Charles Karuku , who is depicted as a local sage. It's telling that Owens chose Karuku to lead her tour through George Floyd Square. There is no shortage of Black faith leaders in the area. In the mile or so radius around the intersection of 38th Street and Chicago Avenue, there are at least five churches with predominantly Black congregations. Karuku's congregation is in a suburb 15 miles away from the memorial. It's a pentecostal church where Karuku performs instant miracles. He has claimed to cure chronic back problems and even heal cancer .\n\nKaruku and Owens walk around the intersection that has since become a memorial site and a controversial semi-autonomous zone (street barricades were cleared out by the city in the summer of 2021) held down by a mix of activists and neighborhood residents. Owens marvels at the thought of an autonomous zone and the memorial constructed around the exact site of Floyd's death. She asks Karuku if Floyd is the wrong role model.\n\n\"We have better people to follow. Jesus Christ and Martin Luther King Jr.,\" says Karuku.\n\nWhat seems to eat at Owens the most is that so many people across the country had compassion. She genuinely can't believe that so many took to the streets on behalf of a flawed human being, a stranger. This solidarity-fighting for someone you don't know-seems foreign to her. It can only be explained by manipulation.\n\nIn her third act, Owens presents a conspiracy in the form of the Black Lives Matter Global Network. There are no big gotcha moments in Owens' exposé that have not already been reported on by other outlets: that BLM Global Network co-founder and former executive director Patrisse Cullors used donation funds to covertly purchase a $6 million house whose purpose is unclear; that Cullors put her family on the payroll; that the group's overall financial picture lacks the transparency that is expected of a prominent tax-exempt, nonprofit organization leading a social movement. In what would be the climax, Owens visits the Los Angeles home of Cullors and stands outside the fence. She is told to leave.\n\nAs she goes through their tax forms with a fine-toothed comb, Owens is much less focused on the substantive criticisms leveled at BLM Global Network by other BLM chapters and parents of the movement's martyrs like Michael Brown Sr . or Samaria Rice . She reserves her outrage for the revelation that trans-rights organizations received donation money from the BLM Global Network.\n\nThat the facts of these improprieties may come as revelations to viewers is partly a product of journalistic failure. A failure that fuels the right-wing media machine's claims that liberals are lying to you. Without diligent, good faith reporting like that of journalist Sean K. Campbell- whose series of articles for New York magazine on the BLM Global Network was an instance of rare, thorough exposé on the group from a major left-leaning outlet-opportunities arise for right-leaning outlets like the Washington Examiner or the New York Post to break the stories. It provides malicious actors like Owens opportunities to exploit.\n\nThe kernel here is that there are fissures within a movement. That some may use a broad political project for personal profit. That the reality of George Floyd the man has been at times ignored as he has become a symbol. None of this can be used to rationalize his murder, or explain it. Yet, that is Owens' goal. \"The real story is a story of addiction,\" she says in the film's final moments. \"It's a story of a man who overdosed...You were all lied to. That's the truth.\"\n\nIn the end, Candace Owens is doing exactly what she thinks she's exposing: lying to profit off a Black man's untimely death.\n\nTop illustration: Jason Davis/Getty (4); Elizabeth Flores/Star Tribune/Getty; Ira L.

      "text": "Black Lives Don't Matter to Black Lives Matter, Says Rudy Giuliani\n\nJuly 1, 2020, Washington, District of Columbia, USA: Rudy Giuliani, personal lawyer to United States President Donald J. Trump, speaks to members of the media following a television interview with One America News Network outside the White House in Washington. (Credit Image: © Stefani Reynolds/CNP via ZUMA Wire)\n\nIt was an open question what former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani would talk about in his primetime address on the fourth and final night of the Republican National Convention. Would he resurrect the debunked charges against Joe Biden that got President Trump impeached ? Would he continue to assert that Biden is experiencing a \"serious loss of mental function\" and \"displaying signs of dementia\"? Would he just kind of wing it, enthralled by his own wit, until the producers played him off the stage with Oscars music?\n\nNo, Giuliani went with option four: arguing that black lives don't matter to Black Lives Matter. In a convention full of appeals to \" law and order ,\" Giuliani's appeal stood out for the sheer audacity-an unabashedly pro-cop ex-prosecutor feigning sympathy with the largest mass protests since the civil rights movement, solely for the purpose of tearing it down.\n\nIn Giuliani's telling, the nation had rallied as one after the \"unforgivable\" killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. The problem, he continued, was that it was too unified for liberals-rather than work with Trump and Republicans, \"BLM and antifa sprang into action and in a flash hijacked the protests into vicious, brutal riots.\" The Black Lives Matter protests were hijacked by...Black Lives Matter? Figure that one out.\n\nBut Giuliani went further. He argued that the protests against police violence were, in fact, causing a massive surge in crime across the country. \"For President Trump, and for us Republicans, all Black Lives Matter,\" he said. He rattled off the names of recent victims of gun violence in cities, he noted, controlled by Democrats. \"It has been like this for decades and it's been controlled throughout by Democrats. In fact, shamefully Obama and Biden did nothing at all to quell the carnage. I guess these Black lives didn't matter to them,\" he said.\n\nGiuliani's speech wasn't exactly coherent. He tried to argue that cities were in the midst of a historic crime spike in response to protests (crime is still low by, say, Giuliani-era levels ) but also that they've always been like this. But mostly it was just a gross permutation of that familiar refrain lodged against critics of police violence -what about Black-on-Black crime? Here was a former mayor who rose to power at the crest of a racist backlash against a Black mayor arguing that the only president to have personally violated the Fair Housing Act cares more about Black lives than the Black people putting their bodies on the line in the streets do. At this point I'm not sure if it's more depressing if he really believes what he's saying or if he doesn't.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Biden Was MIA for Black Lives Matter During the Primary. They're Hoping That'll Change Now.\n\nJeremy Hogan/Sipa via AP\n\nRashad Robinson recalls feeling like a \"pariah\" in Washington during the earliest days of the Black Lives Matter movement. The executive director of Color of Change, the nation's largest online racial justice organization, had been pressuring President Obama to address police brutality in the wake of the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed Black teenager murdered by police in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 . \"I felt a lot of negative heat,\" Robinson recalls, \"and was treated as a radical even by some Black people inside the Obama administration.\"\n\nFive years after Brown's death, President Obama included Color of Change on a list of resources for people looking to learn more about systemic racism and invited Robinson to join him in a virtual roundtable discussion on police reform. And activists like Robinson had a wholly different reception among Democrats running for president over the past year. No longer \"pariahs\" or \"radicals,\" 2020 hopefuls courted progressive Black activists and asked them to weigh in on platforms that elevated their movement's priorities. Those policies were showcased at first-of-their-kind forums dedicated to addressing environmental justice , mass incarceration , and the needs of women of color .\n\nBut Joe Biden was noticeably absent. Biden skipped several of those forums, put little muscle into developing a race-conscious agenda, and didn't reach out to activist groups that other campaigns had pursued. None of that mattered for securing the nomination: Biden won the South Carolina primary, the cycle's first test of Black support, with more than 60 percent of the Black vote. His competitors, meanwhile, delivered their visions for Black America to predominantly white audiences, proof that all the best intentions paled in utility to the trust Biden had built up during his four decades in federal office.\n\nThe Democratic primary is over, and a nesting doll's worth of crises has assumed its place. Black Americans have been killed by COVID-19 at alarming rates and the burden of \"essential work,\" such as health and child care, has primarily fallen on them. Then, the constant drumbeat of police brutality erupted onto the national stage by the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.\n\nAnd now, the racial justice reforms that had found their way onto progressive presidential candidates' platforms match those that protestors are demanding at demonstrations not just in major cities, but also in the unlikeliest of small towns across the country. And those closely aligned with the movement wonder whether Biden will take a page from his fallen opponents' policy ideas-and if the younger, progressive Black activists who helped to author them will have a seat at Biden's table.\n\n\"Those protestors can be voters,\" says Aimee Allison, the founder of She the People, a national network of women of color. \"We have got to get Trump out of office, but if that's replaced with someone who doesn't have a clear vision for racial justice, we won't have a thing for Democrats to prove that there is a will, a heart, and a plan.\"\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement began in the wake of the death of Trayvon Martin, a Black teenager murdered by a white neighbor in 2012, and garnered nationwide attention following Brown's 2014 death. Though the movement's genesis had been in race-based violence, activists aimed to elevate all the layers of systemic racism and white supremacy that imbued the experience of Black Americans. That included drawing attention to discriminatory lending practices, environmental neglect in Black communities, and high maternal death rates among Black mothers in addition to police brutality and high rates of arrest and incarceration. While legacy civil rights groups like the NAACP opted to work closely alongside elected officials and corporations to push for steady, incremental change, Black Lives Matter preferred to work outside the system through demonstrations and social media-driven campaigns.\n\nThe movement's demands went largely unanswered by the Obama administration, and during the 2016 election, it refused to endorse either Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton. It was \"too early in the genesis of the movement to rally around anyone in particular who hasn't demonstrated that they feel accountable to the Black Lives Matter movement,\" Alicia Garza, a co-founder, said at the time. Instead, activists showed up at campaign stops to protest the candidates' unwillingness to connect systemic racism to the economic disadvantages the Black community faced. In August 2016, the Movement for Black Lives-the coalition of organizations aligned with Black Lives Matters-issued a vision document that called for divestment from the criminal justice system, economic reform, and reparations.\n\nAs another presidential cycle began, those demands remained unchanged. But the willingness of Democratic candidates to engage did. Bernie Sanders leaned on the advice of Black scholars and activists to add a racial justice lens to his war on the rich. Elizabeth Warren's trove of plans to combat racial inequality had been authored in partnership with progressive Black women activists and earned her their coveted endorsements . For the first time ever, on subjects such as criminal and environmental justice, \"candidates were forced to have platforms and speak to them,\" says Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), who centered his own presidential run on racial inequality. \"There were countless articles pointing that out as a major deficit in their campaigns.\"\n\nAnother sign of the movement's growing political capital: its ability to undercut candidates who might have gotten more traction in prior presidential primaries. Activists showed up at events for former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg , former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg , and current New York Mayor Bill de Blasio to protest how their administrations had treated Black communities. No apology or plan could shake the stigma the attention left.\n\n\"The presidential primary was so different from any in history because several candidates were exposed around their hypocrisy around police violence and their treatment of Black communities in general,\" says Monifa Bandele, an activist with Malcolm X Grassroots Movement. \"When moments presented themselves for people who do harm to Black communities to run for higher office, we made sure it was known that they betrayed Black communities.\"\n\nBiden, meanwhile, skated by with a middling history. The running mate of the country's first Black president spent the primary scrutinized for his record on busing , his collaborations with anti-segregationists, and his hand in the 1994 crime bill , legislation that ushered in an era of mass incarceration and heavy policing. He nearly announced his candidacy on the same day as the first-ever presidential forum focused on women of color, changing the date only after the faux pas had been brought to his attention. Activists I spoke with told me that while other campaigns heavily courted their input and endorsement, they didn't hear much, if at all, from Biden.\n\nThe hurdles now facing Biden are altogether different than the ones he cleared in the primary. President Trump has fully decamped to the side of white supremacists, but channeling the energy of a movement is an altogether different task. \"What we can achieve when we don't separate politics from movement is a lot,\" Allison says. \"Democrats shouldn't use language that talks about the movement as separate from themselves.\"\n\nCrucial to that, according to advocates I spoke with, is for Biden to invite more of the voices who progressive candidates leaned on to advise him. Even before this charged moment, the Biden campaign had been seeking counsel from legacy groups such as NAACP, but also so-called \"new movement\" organizations, such as Campaign Zero, a police reform campaign founded by Black Lives Matter activists, and Color of Change, the group Robinson leads. But Allison says how the campaign engages these groups is as important as who it engages with. \"Elizabeth Warren made her campaign an on-ramp for activists that explored a co-governance model,\" Allison says. \"Joe Biden needs a really powerful plan to combat white supremacy, but he also needs to explore a governance model so it's not just Joe Biden's plan.\" Allison adds that she'd like to see Biden do more to reach out to Black women activists, something akin to the event Biden held on Monday with Black ministers in his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware.\n\nPolicy, too, will be a major piece of it. During a speech in Philadelphia on Monday, Biden called on Congress to immediately pass laws to stop the transfer of military weapons to police departments, ban officers' use of chokeholds, and establish strong use-of-force standards. He also promised to create national police oversight commission during his first 100 days in office, an end to \"qualified immunity\"-special protection law enforcement has from civil rights lawsuits-and reissued his call for community policing, an existing pillar of his criminal justice plan . In early May, his campaign released the Biden Plan for Black America aimed at rectifying the economic and health care disparities the COVID-19 crisis put on full display.\n\nBut activists say it will take more than that. \"The bar is higher than what it would have been a few years ago because we've gone through the years from Ferguson until now,\" says Maurice Mitchell, president of the Working Families Party, a progressive organization that has made major pushes around policing. Biden has not yet committed to the most pressing ask of many Movement for Black Lives allies: divesting from police. And while Biden has pushed for aspects of the 1994 crime bill to be dismantled, Mitchell thinks Biden should apologize for it altogether. \"He could endear a lot of people to him if he showed how he planned to repair that harm and put forth a bold platform that puts communities before easy 'law and order' rhetoric,\" he says.\n\nBiden also might have to challenge institutions he's often sided with. \"There is no way to make police unions and Black people happy,\" Mitchell says. \"This is a 'Whose side are you on?' moment.\"\n\nColor of Change's Robinson notes that Biden's current plan for Black America doesn't challenge corporate power. \"To have a plan that does not dismantle power or influence is not a plan for racial justice.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "A Sundown Town Sees Its First Black Lives Matter Protest\n\nA person holds up a placard that reads, 'Black lives matter' during a different protest in Detroit, Michigan, on May 29, 2020. Seth Herald / Getty Images\n\nThis story was published in partnership with ProPublica , a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox .\n\nThe image on Facebook showed three raised fists - one white, one brown, one black - with the hashtag BLM overlaid in large letters. A date and place to meet was at the bottom: Thursday, June 4. The location: Anna, Illinois.\n\nA Black Lives Matter protest. In Anna?\n\nIn November, I'd published a story about this small southern Illinois city's reputation as a sundown town-a place where black people were not welcome after dark-and the legend about what Anna stands for: \"Ain't No N--- Allowed.\" The article stirred up strong feelings in the town, where all public officials, police officers and nearly all teachers are white. While many current and former residents wrote to me to share their own stories about racism in the area, others decried the story as perpetuating the A-N-N-A reputation.\n\nA Black Lives Matter protest in Anna. Who was behind it? How many people would join? What would the reaction be?\n\nAnd what would this mean for A-N-N-A?\n\n\"I was terrified to do this. I'm not going to lie,\" said Jessica Moore, 25, one of the organizers.\n\nShe added, \"I've experienced racism in Anna my entire life.\"\n\nMoore, who is biracial, grew up in Ullin, a small town about 20 minutes south of Anna. Her earliest memory of being a victim of racism in Anna happened when she was 8, she told me. As she was leaving the Anna Walmart with her mother, who is white, Moore said she remembers a woman screaming at her after she accidentally pushed a shopping cart into her car, repeatedly calling Moore the N-word. When she got older and started going to bars and restaurants in Anna, she said people would call her the N-word, too.\n\nMoore is one of a small group of young people in southern Illinois leading the region's recent demonstrations against police brutality and in support of black lives, many in towns with histories like Anna's. Most of the organizers did not know one another a month ago. And many, like Moore, are new to the cause.\n\nAfter she took part in her first protest in Paducah, Kentucky, on May 31, Moore said leaders there encouraged her to organize in her own community and gave her some tips. A few days later, a lightbulb went off: \"It's time to show Anna,\" she thought.\n\nAnna resident Takiyah Coleman, 19, agreed. The two, along with several other young adults from the area, met with Anna Police Chief Bryan Watkins to explain their plan to protest. Watkins said he told them he wanted to ensure they felt safe coming to town to do so, but to also expect some opposition from residents.\n\n\"We've never had a demonstration in town like this,\" Watkins, who said he's lived in Anna for 45 years, later told me. (He prefers to use the word \"demonstrate\" instead of \"protest,\" he said, because \"people associate protest with rioting.\")\n\nWhen Watkins informed residents through his personal Facebook page about the event, the post prompted more than 350 shares and 600 comments, which ranged from curiosity to praise to fear.\n\n\"I hope everyone is ready to protect their business with brute force!\" wrote one commenter from the area.\n\n\"How long do these things typically last??\" wrote another.\n\nThe comments reminded me of stories people in Anna have told me about rumors spreading through town in the late 1960s and early 1970s that black people from Cairo, about 30 minutes south, were coming up to Anna to riot. That never happened, but some residents remember waiting with guns in case it did.\n\nAnna City Council member Bryan Miller said he got received calls from residents concerned about the Black Lives Matter protest. He and I have been talking since November, when he commented on a Facebook post about my story, saying: \"Uhm, I'm guessing [A-N-N-A] doesn't go away because you keep writing about an issue that is long gone.\"\n\nI've appreciated our frank discussions about the story and about his community. A new City Council member, Miller said he is determined to erase the A-N-N-A stigma. When residents called him with concerns about the protest, he said that he told them it was a chance to change Anna's reputation, and that, \"I expect you to do your part.\"\n\nThe day of the protest, a post on the official Facebook page for Anna expressed a similar sentiment: \"In recent months, citizens were outraged over an article written about Anna. Well, actions speak louder than words. Tonight is our chance to show the world what we are made of.\"\n\nMoore, one of the organizers, said she expected about 60 people to show up. She was wrong.\n\nNearly 200 people marched through Anna's streets. Many of them were young and white and described themselves as being from southern Illinois. Other area residents gathered along the route to watch an event many thought they'd never see.\n\nAlexis Steward, 21, who grew up in Anna and helped organize the march, said she spent much of it bawling. The tears started when she began to realize how many people had shown up. She remembered when she was bullied at Anna junior high. She said she wants Anna to be a place where she feels she could start a family, and where she wouldn't have to worry about her children feeling the pain she felt growing up there.\n\n\"I've always been shy,\" Steward said. \"Not anymore.\"\n\n\"We need more people who are educated, loud and who can stand for people who cannot.\"\n\nWhen she marched past some Anna residents she recognized, who she said were screaming at the protesters to \"get out of their town,\" she said she knew she was doing something right.\n\nSo, too, did Aveon Winfield, another organizer, who grew up in nearby Grand Chain. When he heard onlookers repeatedly use the N-word, Winfield, 21, said he kept his eyes fixed on the ground and marched on. Winfield's mother has worked for years at a mental health center in Anna. He thought about her, a woman of color, spending her days in a town where some residents still used racial slurs.\n\nColeman said she wanted the protest to show other residents that \"change starts here.\" Coleman and her family moved to Anna from Chicago three years ago, she said. She knew what Anna stood for but said she didn't think much of it until a white customer at the local McDonald's, where she worked, refused to let her pour his coffee.\n\nAmong the marchers, too, was Easter Smith.\n\nI first met Easter in 2018, after a number of Anna residents suggested I speak with her. At the time, Smith and her six children were one of the few black families living in Anna. Her eldest son, Arieh, had won the Illinois state wrestling championship for his weight class. He was elected homecoming king of Anna-Jonesboro Community High School. I wrote about how the family challenged many white residents' assumptions about black people while quietly struggling to balance their very public status in the community with the private pain of the racism they experienced.\n\nEaster said she has lost some friends in Anna and become more outspoken about her experience there since the story was published. Last week, her family moved about 20 minutes away, to Murphysboro. She said she would have liked to stay in Anna until her children finished school there, but she had trouble finding a comfortable home to rent. She decided to march before she left, she said, because she felt she \"needed to see it.\"\n\n\"How are we going to be one of the first black families and not go to the protest?\" Easter said.\n\nEarly on during the protest, a speaker, who was white, reminded the crowd of the signs posted around the city limits in Arieh's honor, a positive contrast to signs long rumored to have once warned black people to be out of town before dark.\n\nTwo thoughts struck Easter. The first, she said, was that, as a black person in America, \"Normally when your name is called in public, it's because it's in memorial.\" The second: It \"doesn't take away racism because a black kid holds a title at your school.\"\n\nThe protest ended peacefully. Police made no arrests. No property was damaged.\n\nThe protest was covered across the region and the focus of a Reuters story about small-town Black Lives Matter protests, which was republished by national news outlets.\n\nThe headline of a story in the Southern Illinoisan referenced a chant repeated at the protest: \" Ain't No Negativity Allowed ,\" a new, positive twist on A-N-N-A.\n\nMiller, the City Council member, said he's thinking about making yard signs for residents with the slogan. Everybody is welcome in Anna, he said.\n\nI asked him what he thinks can be done to show that beyond the protest.\n\n\"It's our responsibility to change everything that is going on around here,\" Miller said. \"If people were more just willing to talk to other people, things would change so much quicker.\"\n\nI asked some of the organizers, too, whether Anna still deserves A-N-N-A.\n\nMoore didn't think so, though she said, \"There are people in Anna that still give Anna the name it has.\"\n\nBut Coleman disagreed. The town is still A-N-N-A, she said.\n\n\"The people in the town have to change in order for that to change. They have to make it mean something else,\" Coleman said. \"They have to not be racist.\"\n\nBut, she added: \"Change starts somewhere, and if a group of teenagers have to be the ones to do it, so be it.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Why Did Black Lives Matter and the NAACP Call for an End to More Charter Schools?\n\nStudents in a writing class at KIPP Memphis Collegiate Middle School in Memphis Alan Spearman/AP\n\nA few weeks ago, the Movement for Black Lives, the network that also includes Black Lives Matter organizers, released its first-ever policy agenda . Among the organization's six demands and dozens of policy recommendations was a bold education-related stance: a moratorium on both charter schools and public school closures. Charters, the agenda argues, represent a shift of public funds and control over to private entities. Along with \"an end to the privatization of education,\" the Movement for Black Lives organizers are demanding increased investments in traditional community schools and the health and social services they provide.\n\nThe statement came several weeks after another civil rights titan, the NAACP, also passed a resolution , calling for a freeze on the growth of charter schools. The NAACP had equated charters with privatization in previous resolutions, but this year's statement-which will not become policy until the National Board meeting in the fall-represents the strongest anti-charter language to date, according to Julian Vasquez Heilig , a professor of education leadership and education chair of the NAACP's California State Conference. \"The NAACP is really concerned about unregulated growth of charter schools, and says it's time to pause and take stock,\" says Vasquez Heilig, who posted a copy of the resolution on his blog.\n\nSuch policy positions come at a time when parents, legislators, and philanthropists across the country-from Boston to Philadelphia to Los Angeles-are embroiled in fierce debates over the role of charters, particularly in poor, urban areas where most of these schools have been growing. Since 2000, the number of charters more than tripled , from about 1.7 percent to 6.2 percent of public schools.\n\nCharter proponents-including prominent black educators like Secretary of Education John King Jr., Geoffrey Canada, and Steve Perry-argue that legislators need to continue this momentum for \"choice\" and competition among schools, citing the high test scores and college acceptance letters that many charter schools deliver. \"We should not have artificial barriers to the growth of charters that are good,\" King told reporters at the recent annual National Association of Black Journalists-National Association of Hispanic Journalists convention, adding that \"charters should be a part of the public school landscape and can be a driver of opportunity for kids.\"\n\nSkeptics counter that charter schools contribute to racial and socioeconomic segregation, and that high percentages of charter school students in poor, urban districts can also contribute to the fiscal stress and the downward spiral of the traditional schools. Throughout the country, Vasquez Heilig noted, state charter laws vary dramatically: Some charter schools find ways to exclude disadvantaged children; others are created with explicit commitment to serve the most disadvantaged students. Vasquez Heilig argued that a moratorium would allow the public to investigate current practices and promote those that work the best.\n\n\"It's time to pause and investigate: Should there be so many entities that are allowed to open them?\" he said. \"If you are not an educator, should you be allowed to open a charter school? Is there a due process for parents who feel that their kids were pushed out? How do charters schools make decisions about firing and hiring? How do they spend public money?\"\n\nHere are some of the most significant concerns charter school critics have cited over the years:\n\nSome charter schools practice \"skimming.\" There is growing evidence that some charters accept only the least difficult (and that means the least expensive to educate) students. Earlier this month, a report by the ACLU Foundation of Southern California and the public interest law firm Public Advocates found that 1 in 5 California charter schools practice restrictive admissions requirements or other exclusionary practices-even though charter schools are required by law to admit all students who wish to attend. Some of these practices included denying enrollment to students with lower grades or test scores; expelling students who struggle academically; or requiring students and parents to write essays and go through admission interviews.\n\nResearchers at the University of California-Los Angeles' Center for Civil Rights Remedies also expressed similar concerns when they noticed a national pattern in their 2016 study : Some charters had both high test scores and very high suspension rates, they noted, prompting the authors of the report to conclude, \"Although beyond the scope of this report, the possibility certainly exists that some charter schools are artificially boosting their test scores or graduation rates by using harsh discipline to discourage lower-achieving youth from continuing to attend.\"\n\nMeanwhile, traditional schools tend to educate students with greater challenges that cost more. One study in Philadelphia, for example, found that students with severe needs-those who have been in foster care, involved with the juvenile justice system, or whose families are on welfare-are concentrated in traditional public schools in Philadelphia. Traditional schools in Philadelphia also educate 10 percent more students living in poverty, 4 percent more English learners, and 2 percent more students with special needs.\n\nUnregulated growth and lack of strong oversight. In June, the New York Times published a scathing investigation of Detroit's school district, which has a bigger share of students in charters than any other city except New Orleans. Reporter Kate Zernike concluded, among many other findings, that insufficiently regulated growth-including too many agencies that are allowed to open new charter schools-contributed to a system with \"lots of choice, with no good choice\":\n\nThe unchecked growth of charters has created a glut of schools competing for some of the nation's poorest students, enticing them to enroll with cash bonuses, laptops, raffle tickets for iPads and bicycles. Leaders of charter and traditional schools alike say they are being cannibalized, fighting so hard over students and the limited public dollars that follow them that no one thrives. Michigan leapt at the promise of charter schools 23 years ago, betting big that choice and competition would improve public schools. It got competition, and chaos.\n\nOther districts and states with high percentages of students in charter schools have come under similar criticism. In April, the general auditor of Pennsylvania published a report concluding that the state's charter laws are the \"worst in the US,\" contributing to questionable financial practices in some charters in the district of Philadelphia, as well as fiscal woes in the state's largest school district.\n\nUnregulated explosion of charters drains money from traditional public schools. In most districts, per-pupil money follows students, but many expenses, such as building costs, salaries for teachers, and principals don't go away when a student leaves for a charter school. Students in charter schools can also create extra costs. In Philadelphia, for example, the district has to pay for transportation for students attending charter schools that are often not in their neighborhood. The city also found that 30 percent of all charter students come from outside the district, but the city still has to pay for their education. As a result, a study by the Boston Consulting Group estimated that each new student in a charter school in Philadelphia creates as much as $7,000 in additional costs for the district.\n\nCharter schools suspend more black students and children with disabilities . This year, UCLA's Center for Civil Rights Remedies published a study that for the first time looked at the numbers of \"out-of-school\" suspensions for 5,250 charter schools and 95,000 public schools. The researchers found that while overall suspension rates have been going down since 2012, in charter schools, black students and students with disabilities were suspended at higher percentages in all grades than their peers in traditional schools. In middle and high schools, 12 percent more students with disabilities and 2.5 percent more black students were suspended in charters compared with noncharters.\n\nPaying attention to this data is important, because researchers have found that being suspended is a strong indicator that a student will eventually drop out. And students who drop out are much more likely to end up in prison, becoming part of the \" school-to-prison pipeline .\" This issue disproportionately affects black students (in charter and noncharter schools), who are suspended at a rate four times greater than white students.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Garza co-founded the Black Lives Matter movement when she wrote \"Black lives matter\" in a Facebook post almost seven years ago, and she's featured in an insightful, wide-ranging interview this week by NatGeo 's Rachel Hartigan. Since launching the Black Lives Matter Global Network with Opal Tometi and Patrisse Cullors, Garza has rallied and amplified the voices and lives of countless people who drive change, bearing witness to what has changed and what still needs to. Her interview touches on the construction of the phrase \"Black Lives Matters,\" the basis for maintaining hope, the ways a movement for change can stay its course, and the unifying threads of collective action.

      "text": "Black Lives Matter Activist Cori Bush Defeats Corporate-Backed Democratic Congress Member\n\nCori Bush Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty\n\nIn a stunning upset, Black Lives Matter activist Cori Bush has defeated 10-term incumbent Rep. Lacy Clay in the Democratic primary for Missouri's 1st Congressional District, according to the Associated Press . Bush, a minister and registered nurse, has been heavily involved in protests against police violence since the 2014 Ferguson protests. Mother Jones ' Kara Voght wrote about the race last week:\n\nFor 400 days in 2014 and 2015, protesters gathered in Ferguson, Missouri, to register their outrage over the police killing of unarmed Black teenager Michael Brown. For most of those days, Bush joined them-at first, in her capacity as a registered nurse to tend to protesters' injuries, and later as a community organizer on the front lines. She went out again in 2017 to organize after another white police officer was acquitted of murder in the 2011 shooting death of a Black man during a car chase in north St. Louis. This year, as Americans across the country protested Floyd's killing, a white police officer in the St. Louis suburb of Florissant-Bush's hometown- ran over a Black man with his unmarked SUV before getting out of the car to repeatedly kick him. And so Bush and her fellow Ferguson activists organized yet another demonstration against police brutality. During a June gathering, she tweeted that she had been pepper-sprayed in the eyes by the cops.\n\n[...]\n\nThe race features two Black leaders with very different ideas about how to create change. Clay is a consummate insider who has spent decades building political power, which he has used to secure tangible, if incremental, progress on issues including police abuse. Bush, who is also an ordained minister, has little patience for incremental measures. She believes the district that helped turn Black Lives Matter into a national movement should have an activist in its congressional seat, someone who stands unwaveringly with BLM's demands.\n\n[...]\n\nBush has also slammed Clay's coziness with corporate interests. Three-quarters of the nearly $750,000 Clay raised through June of this year came from political action committees, nearly 80 percent of which are backed by big business. His top campaign contributor is Quicken Loans, a mortgage giant that Clay is charged with overseeing from his perch on the Financial Services Committee. In 2015, the Justice Department sued Quicken for originating hundreds of home loans for borrowers who weren't eligible for them. (The company agreed to pay $32.5 million to settle the case without admitting wrongdoing.)\n\nClay maintains that his fundraising has no bearing on how he votes. But Fight Corporate Monopolies, a progressive group, placed a six-figure television ad buy to revisit an episode in which Clay sided with financial services companies to fight against a rule that would force investment advisers to act in their clients' best interests.\n\nYou can read the full story here .\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "\n\nBlack liberationists have long found kinship with the Palestinian cause, seeing a common desire to live free of violence.\n\nA mural of George Floyd appeared on the West Bank Wall in Bethlehem, Palestine, in December 2022. (Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nDuring the racial justice uprisings of 2020, multiple murals of George Floyd appeared in Gaza and the West Bank. Meanwhile, in the US, Palestinian flags became a common sight at Black Lives Matter protests, and in 2021, the official BLM organization issued a statement declaring \"solidarity with Palestinians\" and opposition to \"settler colonialism in all forms.\" That year, The Washington Post wrote that BLM's influence had \"changed the US debate on the Mideast,\" increasing support for Palestinians among self-identified Democrats. At its zenith earlier this year, that support, according to polls , eclipsed sympathy for Israel for the first time in more than two decades. But the bloodshed in the Israel-Gaza war has fractured the left and the Democratic Party-and revealed deep fissures within the Black community. Historically, radical Black activists have found kinship with the Palestinian cause. During his third trip to the Middle East in 1964, Malcolm X advocated for \"the right of the Arab refugees to return to their Palestine homeland.\" Two months later, he wrote in the English-language Egyptian Gazette , \"There are over 100 million of our people in the western hemisphere who are of African origin. Just because our forefathers once lived here in Africa, would this give Afro-Americans the right to come back here to the mother continent to drive the rightful citizens...from their cities, confiscate all their property for ourselves, and set up a 'new Afro-American nation'-as the European Zionists have done to our Arab brothers and sisters in Palestine?\" But Malcolm X was an outlier. Black civil rights figures overwhelmingly supported the Zionist cause even prior to the Holocaust, at a time when many leftist American Jews opposed the idea . As early as 1916, the pan-Africanist Marcus Garvey spoke in terms of a Black Zionism. (\"When the Jew said, 'We shall have Palestine!,'\" Garvey said , \"the same sentiment came to us when we said, 'We shall have Africa!'\") NAACP cofounder W.E.B. Du Bois wrote after the Holocaust that a \"theoretical demand for a [homeland] now became a necessity for more than a million displaced and homeless Jews.\" The same year, A. Philip Randolph advised Black Americans to \"fight for the right of the Jews to set up a commonwealth in Palestine.\" And though United Nations mediator Ralph Bunche privately registered skepticism about the permanence of the 1949 Middle East armistice he had brokered-which resulted in his becoming the first Black Nobel Peace Prize winner-he betrayed no lack of faith in the project publicly. The 1967 Six-Day War saw Israel seize the West Bank and Gaza Strip, just as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee was becoming more internationalist. A 1967 SNCC newsletter included the article \"The Palestine Problem: Test Your Knowledge,\" which included a series of \"Did you know?\" questions about the founding and history of Israel. The article drew charges of anti-Semitism from civil rights leaders, including Randolph and Bayard Rustin, as well as from Jewish organizations, and survives as documentary evidence of the ideological tensions separating the civil rights guard and emerging Black Power transnationalism. In a follow-up message in August 1967, SNCC wrote, \"We recognize Hitler's massacre of the Jews as one of the worst crimes against humanity,\" adding: \"By the same token, we do not see how the Jewish refugees and survivors could ever use this tragedy as an excuse to imitate their Nazi oppressors-to take over Palestine, to commit some of the same atrocities against the native Arab inhabitants, and to completely dispossess the Arabs of their homes, land and livelihood.\" In 1970, the Black Panther Party released a statement declaring, \"We support the Palestinians' just struggle for liberation one hundred percent.\" Related Articles Muslim and Arab Voters Are Sending Biden a Stark Warning-and He'd Better Pay Attention Dana El Kurd All We Want in Gaza Is to Live Mohammed R. Mhawish Biden's Israel-Palestine Policy Could Cost Him the Election Elie Mystal Alliances between Black Americans and Palestinians seemingly dissipated in the late 1970s and '80s amid an overall downturn in Black liberation activism, driven in part by COINTELPRO and the FBI's subsequently declassified campaign to discredit the movement; the arrests and assassinations of movement leaders; and the mainstream media's scaremongering narratives . But injustice-with its perennial partner, tragedy-would reestablish the relationship in 2013. The acquittal of George Zimmerman, the murderer of Trayvon Martin, sparked the movement that would become Black Lives Matter . In July 2013, marchers at a protest in the Palestinian town of Bethlehem donned hoodies in recognition of Martin and those protesting his killer's impunity. The police killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., in 2014, and the explosion of protests that followed, occurred during weeks of bombing in Gaza that, the prominent Israeli historian Benny Morris wrote , caused a \"massive civilian toll among Palestinians.\" The Palestinian American activist Bassem Masri, who often live-streamed protests, wrote , \"The timing of the two events woke up a lot of people,\" as did the similar postmortem demonization of Palestinians and Black Americans who had been killed as a result of state-backed violence. \"People naturally saw the connections....

During the 2014 Right to Education Campaign , 10 students from Palestine's Birzeit University traveled to St. Louis and Ferguson to meet with local activists and organizers. In January 2015, a coalition of journalists, artists, and organizers representing Ferguson, Black Lives Matter, Black Youth Project 100, and other groups, organized by Dream Defenders, spent 10 days in the occupied Palestinian territories and Israel. \"We thought the connections between the African American leadership of the movement in the US and those on the ground in Palestine needed to be reestablished and fortified,\" Ahmad Abuznaid, a cofounder of Dream Defenders, told Ebony . \"As a Palestinian who has learned a great deal about struggle, movement, militancy, and liberation from African Americans in the US, I dreamed of the day where I could bring that power back to my people in Palestine.\" That cross-cultural meet-up yielded the organization Black for Palestine , which issued the Black Solidarity Statement With Palestine , signed by more than 1,000 Black scholars, activists, students, and artists. The collective also released the video When I See Them, I See Us , which the Palestinian American human rights attorney and producer Noura Erakat said \"highlight[s] [the] similarities, but not sameness, of Black and Palestinian life.\" In 2016, the Movement for Black Lives , representing more than 50 Black organizations, published a platform that included a statement identifying America's support for Israel as \"complicit in the genocide taking place against the Palestinian people.... Israel is an apartheid state with over 50 laws on the books that sanction discrimination against the Palestinian people.\" In the immediate aftermath of the brutal attacks by Hamas on Israeli civilians on October 7, establishment-oriented Black civil rights groups and political actors-the Congressional Black Caucus , the African American Mayors Association , and House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries -all issued statements affirming solidarity with Israel and condemning Hamas's attacks. The Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network, the National Urban League, and the NAACP issued a joint statement emphasizing humanity's \"commitments to one another\" and extending prayers to all \"innocent civilians' families.\" In contrast, many BLM chapters across the country reaffirmed solidarity with Palestinians, often garnering significant backlash . Some BLM chapters went too far. BLM Chicago, for instance, posted an image on Twitter depicting paragliders-used by Hamas in the attacks-and stating \"I Stand With Palestine.\" The group later removed the post and wrote that they \"aren't proud of it.\" That message was, without question, unacceptable and did nothing to help the Palestinian cause. Still, I'm begging everyone not to fall for right-wing activist Christopher Rufo's stated intention to \"create a strong association between Hamas, BLM, DSA, and academic 'decolonization' in the public mind.\" The recent history of BLM's solidarity with Palestine-and the longer history of Black radicals' embrace of that cause-is rooted not in rhetoric, but in organizing, mutual aid, and the radical idea that everybody-everybody-has got to be free.\n\nHistorically, radical Black activists have found kinship with the Palestinian cause. During his third trip to the Middle East in 1964, Malcolm X advocated for \"the right of the Arab refugees to return to their Palestine homeland.\" Two months later, he wrote in the English-language Egyptian Gazette , \"There are over 100 million of our people in the western hemisphere who are of African origin. Just because our forefathers once lived here in Africa, would this give Afro-Americans the right to come back here to the mother continent to drive the rightful citizens...from their cities, confiscate all their property for ourselves, and set up a 'new Afro-American nation'-as the European Zionists have done to our Arab brothers and sisters in Palestine?\" But Malcolm X was an outlier. Black civil rights figures overwhelmingly supported the Zionist cause even prior to the Holocaust, at a time when many leftist American Jews opposed the idea . As early as 1916, the pan-Africanist Marcus Garvey spoke in terms of a Black Zionism. (\"When the Jew said, 'We shall have Palestine!,'\" Garvey said , \"the same sentiment came to us when we said, 'We shall have Africa!'\") NAACP cofounder W.E.B. Du Bois wrote after the Holocaust that a \"theoretical demand for a [homeland] now became a necessity for more than a million displaced and homeless Jews.\" The same year, A. Philip Randolph advised Black Americans to \"fight for the right of the Jews to set up a commonwealth in Palestine.\" And though United Nations mediator Ralph Bunche privately registered skepticism about the permanence of the 1949 Middle East armistice he had brokered-which resulted in his becoming the first Black Nobel Peace Prize winner-he betrayed no lack of faith in the project publicly. The 1967 Six-Day War saw Israel seize the West Bank and Gaza Strip, just as the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee was becoming more internationalist. A 1967 SNCC newsletter included the article \"The Palestine Problem: Test Your Knowledge,\" which included a series of \"Did you know?\" questions about the founding and history of Israel. The article drew charges of anti-Semitism from civil rights leaders, including Randolph and Bayard Rustin, as well as from Jewish organizations, and survives as documentary evidence of the ideological tensions separating the civil rights guard and emerging Black Power transnationalism. In a follow-up message in August 1967, SNCC wrote, \"We recognize Hitler's massacre of the Jews as one of the worst crimes against humanity,\" adding: \"By the same token, we do not see how the Jewish refugees and survivors could ever use this tragedy as an excuse to imitate their Nazi oppressors-to take over Palestine, to commit some of the same atrocities against the native Arab inhabitants, and to completely dispossess the Arabs of their homes, land and livelihood.\" In 1970, the Black Panther Party released a statement declaring, \"We support the Palestinians' just struggle for liberation one hundred percent.\" Related Articles Muslim and Arab Voters Are Sending Biden a Stark Warning-and He'd Better Pay Attention Dana El Kurd All We Want in Gaza Is to Live Mohammed R.

But injustice-with its perennial partner, tragedy-would reestablish the relationship in 2013. The acquittal of George Zimmerman, the murderer of Trayvon Martin, sparked the movement that would become Black Lives Matter .

The police killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., in 2014, and the explosion of protests that followed, occurred during weeks of bombing in Gaza that, the prominent Israeli historian Benny Morris wrote , caused a \"massive civilian toll among Palestinians.\" The Palestinian American activist Bassem Masri, who often live-streamed protests, wrote , \"The timing of the two events woke up a lot of people,\" as did the similar postmortem demonization of Palestinians and Black Americans who had been killed as a result of state-backed violence. \"People naturally saw the connections....

And just as inevitably, instead of addressing this country's pervasive racism and anti-Blackness, white Americans locate the problem somewhere within Black people themselves. We're in yet another of those moments, as last summer's promised \"racial reckoning\" turns out to be a white lie. Black demands for full citizenship and equality are being treated as entitlement, calls for white racial accountability redefined as white persecution, and anti-racism falsely construed as anti-whiteness. To reestablish unchallenged white dominance, a movement of white resistance, or anti -anti-racism, is working tirelessly to blot out what it sees as a problematic presence-purging Black folks from democracy by stripping voting rights, erasing Black struggle from history by banning the teaching of slavery and its legacy, and prohibiting protest that threatens the white supremacist status quo. We can be shocked, but certainly not surprised. This nation has a long history of counterbalancing any move toward Black liberation with the insistence that Black existence is better wholly removed or more tightly controlled. In an 1814 missive addressing the prospect of African American emancipation, Thomas Jefferson advocated for Black expatriation to another country, contending that without the yoke of slavery around their necks, African Americans were \"pests in society.\" Abraham Lincoln, even as he drafted the Emancipation Proclamation in 1862, told a delegation of Black leaders invited to the White House that \"your race suffer very greatly...by living among us, while ours suffer from your presence,\" and placed the blame for \"white men cutting one another's throats\" on Black folks requesting equality, claiming \"but for your race among us there could not be war.\" Lincoln suggested the solution was for Black people to \"sacrifice something of your present comfort\" by picking up stakes and relocating abroad, an idea the president would support until days before his assassination. Many would assert that Jefferson and Lincoln were just white \"men of their time,\" but even as the times have changed, this pervasive white American attitude has not. The Republican Party has gone all-in on attacking critical race theory, labeling it a \"dangerous ideology,\" \"anti-American,\" and \"a blatant attempt to change the foundational principles of our nation,\" despite the fact that no GOP lawmaker seems to know what CRT is. Conservative legislatures are seeking to ban the teaching of structural racism in 22 states, though CRT itself is already not being taught outside of graduate and law schools. The party has taken a similar approach to the 1619 Project, introducing federal bills to defund the teaching of the curriculum to students in grades K-12. Under the guise of anti-riot measures-and to push the idea that protest for Black lives is inherently violent-over 70 bills that criminalize protest have been proposed around the country, including multiple \"hit and kill\" laws that would effectively make it legal to run over protesters with a car.

Conservative propagandist Christopher Rufo admitted in March that his \"goal is to have the public read something crazy in the newspaper and immediately think 'critical race theory.' We have decodified the term and will recodify it to annex the entire range of cultural constructions that are unpopular with Americans.\" But that strategy works only because it is easy to stoke white fears of status loss in the face of even the most minor Black progress, an outlook that views Black appeals for equality as a kind of racial overreach. The more Black liberation movements are viewed by conservatives as potentially successful, the more vigorous the reactionary effort to shut them down, to demean them as a threat to the country and, more importantly, white feelings. (Note how many of the right-wingers opposing CRT claim it makes children feel bad.) It's not us, it's you , in other words.

March 12, 2025 In 1961, as white parents raged against integration, James Baldwin addressed what motivated their anger: \"They do not really know what it is they are afraid of, but they know they are afraid of something, and they are so frightened that they are nearly out of their minds.... We would never, never allow Negroes to starve, to grow bitter, and to die in ghettos all over the country if we were not driven by some nameless fear that has nothing to do with Negroes.\" And here we are again. I noted last September that white support for Black Lives Matter, which surged immediately after George Floyd's murder, had already fallen precipitously less than two months later. A recent New York Times investigation finds that a year later, \"Republicans and white people have actually become less supportive of Black Lives Matter than they were before the death of George Floyd-a trend that seems unlikely to reverse anytime soon.\" In tandem with that drop-off in support, there's been a rise in \"tough on crime\" sentiment, a reaction to the defund-the-police messaging that gained traction last summer. Never mind that crime is down overall and that the 2020 increases in homicides occurred not only in cities that trimmed police funds-always by tiny amounts that fall far from actual defunding-but also in those that made no cuts to police budgets or poured yet more money into law enforcement. Jennifer Chudy, an assistant professor of political science at Wellesley College who contributed to the Times study, expressed skepticism last year that white support for BLM would hold. Recently, noting that white support for Black civil rights correlates with racial sympathy, Chudy said that \"less than 20 percent [of white people] feel sympathy towards...every flavor of Black suffering, from microaggression to physical altercations akin to what George Floyd faced.\" And thus, for an awful lot of white Americans, the complications of racism would be solved if Black people would stop complaining about it. If only we'd all just go along to get along, things would feel a lot better. Nearly 120 years ago, in The Souls of Black Folk , W.E.B. Du Bois addressed the query that is almost never overtly posed to Black folks but is always embedded in the national understanding of race: \"How does it feel to be a problem?\" It remains the wrong question.\n\nWe're in yet another of those moments, as last summer's promised \"racial reckoning\" turns out to be a white lie. Black demands for full citizenship and equality are being treated as entitlement, calls for white racial accountability redefined as white persecution, and anti-racism falsely construed as anti-whiteness. To reestablish unchallenged white dominance, a movement of white resistance, or anti -anti-racism, is working tirelessly to blot out what it sees as a problematic presence-purging Black folks from democracy by stripping voting rights, erasing Black struggle from history by banning the teaching of slavery and its legacy, and prohibiting protest that threatens the white supremacist status quo. We can be shocked, but certainly not surprised. This nation has a long history of counterbalancing any move toward Black liberation with the insistence that Black existence is better wholly removed or more tightly controlled. In an 1814 missive addressing the prospect of African American emancipation, Thomas Jefferson advocated for Black expatriation to another country, contending that without the yoke of slavery around their necks, African Americans were \"pests in society.\" Abraham Lincoln, even as he drafted the Emancipation Proclamation in 1862, told a delegation of Black leaders invited to the White House that \"your race suffer very greatly...by living among us, while ours suffer from your presence,\" and placed the blame for \"white men cutting one another's throats\" on Black folks requesting equality, claiming \"but for your race among us there could not be war.\" Lincoln suggested the solution was for Black people to \"sacrifice something of your present comfort\" by picking up stakes and relocating abroad, an idea the president would support until days before his assassination. Many would assert that Jefferson and Lincoln were just white \"men of their time,\" but even as the times have changed, this pervasive white American attitude has not. The Republican Party has gone all-in on attacking critical race theory, labeling it a \"dangerous ideology,\" \"anti-American,\" and \"a blatant attempt to change the foundational principles of our nation,\" despite the fact that no GOP lawmaker seems to know what CRT is. Conservative legislatures are seeking to ban the teaching of structural racism in 22 states, though CRT itself is already not being taught outside of graduate and law schools. The party has taken a similar approach to the 1619 Project, introducing federal bills to defund the teaching of the curriculum to students in grades K-12. Under the guise of anti-riot measures-and to push the idea that protest for Black lives is inherently violent-over 70 bills that criminalize protest have been proposed around the country, including multiple \"hit and kill\" laws that would effectively make it legal to run over protesters with a car.

Usner)\n\nDonna Murch is one of the foremost historians of Black radical movements in the 20th century. Her first book, 2010's Living for the City: Migration, Education, and the Rise of the Black Panther Party in Oakland , retold a seemingly familiar story with new insights drawn from oral histories and untapped archives. Murch saw the story of the Panthers as a product of the Great Migration and as a fight for, among other things, access to public resources, countering both conservative and liberal framings that saw the party as either a criminal enterprise or a project solely devoted to self-defense. In the process, she demonstrated that the group was far more complicated than had been recognized. Since that groundbreaking book's publication, Murch has become known as well for her distinguished essays on racial inequities in America. With a historian's eye for detail, she has tackled such subjects as the Movement for Black Lives, the opioid epidemic, and mass incarceration for The Boston Review . Her most recent book, Assata Taught Me , collects these and other writings about the development of the Movement for Black Lives as part of a longer history that dates back at least to the Black Panther Party and that has been especially inspired by the work and thought of Assata Shakur. Murch is currently an associate professor at Rutgers University, where she serves as the chapter president of her union. The Nation spoke with her earlier this year about her new book, her research on the crack epidemic, and the future of Black radical organizing against state violence. -Elias Rodriques E lias R odriques: What led you to write this book? D onna M urch: Most of these essays came about in a moment of joy and surprise. I was in Los Angeles from August 2013 through August 2015 to write a book called Crack in Los Angeles: Policing the Crisis in the War on Drugs . I am, in my heart, a social historian. I like to write about the places where I am, because I want the depth of experience that makes that kind of research possible. So I took this research trip. I conducted oral histories, went to different archives, and kept facing this conundrum: Even though there's a collective recognition of how damaging the Wars on Crime and Drugs were, people had difficulty mounting organized resistance to them. There were pockets of resistance and intellectuals. There were ways that people in their everyday lives resisted being criminalized. But finding organized resistance was difficult, despite the work of amazing people like the organizers of Coalition Against Police Abuse, Michael Zinzun, and others. Then, just as I arrived, there was this amazing arc that we've come to know as the Movement for Black Lives. It wasn't called that at the time, but that summer of 2013 [when people began using the hashtag #Blacklivesmatter on Twitter in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman] helped birth all these organizations. Out of excitement for that political movement, I wrote a series of essays, extending the timeline of the 1980s and '90s that I had been researching to think about this period: the second administration of Barack Obama and the last decade, where we have seen much of the organized resistance to these overlapping punishment campaigns.

DM: In terms of repression and resistance, it takes people and communities time to understand what is happening to them. Take the example of the modern civil rights movement: what became visible as the national civil rights movement emerged in the mid-1950s with Brown v. Board of Education . But the institutions and infrastructure for fighting that battle went back at least to the 1930s. Some would take it back to Reconstruction. There's a similar dynamic going on with the carceral state. I lived through this era. I was a teenager in the 1980s. And the way that we understand it now is very different. The level of criminalization and sensationalization and the definition of \"monsters\"-the language of \"crack babies\" and \"gang members\"-were at the center of the spectacle of punishment, so much so that they occluded the enormous violence of the state. It takes time for people to figure out how to mount resistance to something that, at the time, they may not even recognize is happening. It's very similar in the opioid crisis. Initially, these crises are understood as individual experiences, but to define them as a collective experience with culpable parties takes time. ER: You mentioned that you were a teenager at the time. What did you experience? DM: The first time I heard of crack, I was in college in the late '80s. I went home [to Erie, Pa.] to visit my parents and went to this doughnut shop on the east side of the city. This was one of the oldest parts of the city, with a lot of housing that had not been well maintained. It also had a giant industrial dumpsite. People didn't spend much time outside there in the winter, or even in the summer, for that matter. It always felt a little bit deserted. But we went to this doughnut shop in this neighborhood around midnight, just as the doughnuts were coming out. It was really cold, something like zero degrees, and there were all these little boys standing outside. I didn't have a context for understanding why they were there. It was only later, from talking to friends, that I realized that they were likely selling drugs. And I realized that a lot of the street-level drug economy is facilitated through young people. Arguably, a lot of it is child labor. It's not a sensational story, but it stands out in my mind because of their vulnerability: their vulnerability to the cold, their vulnerability in the part of the city that they were in, and the vulnerability that comes with being a young person working at midnight. ER: Let's keep moving back in time. Assata Taught Me begins with the uptick in the Great Migration in the 1940s and '50s. Why start there? DM: I wanted to think about an arc that connected the organizing and radical possibilities in the postwar social movements like the Black Panther Party with what happened in the years after their heyday and finally with the rise of the Movement for Black Lives. The essay that starts the collection is a genesis, explaining the origins of the Black Panthers. It's different from the way the Panthers were understood in the '80s and '90s. We now have Stanley Nelson's documentary about the party that was funded, partially, by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. This was unimaginable in the '90s. The Panthers were demonized. They were largely excluded from professional histories and history departments, and they were often talked about as criminals. But I wanted to start with a sense of radical possibilities as a factor in the '60s and '70s. At the time, people who became Panthers had migrated to California from Louisiana, Texas, and Arkansas. They were migrating for the opportunity for their children to attend high school, because many of the segregated cities and towns did not even have Black high schools. But in that period from the '40s through the early '70s, massive federal subsidies were poured into public education in California. California schools were much better resourced and funded than they are today. And in researching the genesis of the Black Panthers, I found something that surprised me: The Black Panther Party started with a study group, the Afro-American Association, at Merritt College in Oakland. If you look at the people that became important later-Oakland's first Black mayor, members of the Black Panther Party, Ron Karenga-they can all be traced back to this study group. ER: At a community college. DM: We don't talk nearly enough about community colleges. The majority of people in this country attend community colleges and get associate degrees. Then, and now, we need to look past this elite bias in the United States that takes small private schools as representative. This is a privileging of the wealthiest people in the country as the normative subjects, even though they have no real relationship to what life is really like in the United States. And their numbers are tiny. Containing the cost of expanding higher education in California was done by trying to create a pyramid with the broadest base being the community colleges, the mid-level being the state level colleges, and then the very top was the UC system. But Black students organized to use access to community colleges to figure out transfer rules to access the entire system of higher education. The study group and public schools are important parts of the stories of the '60s: poor and working-class kids accessing higher education without debt. (One of the most painful things is the way that these populations that became important to the formation of the Panthers-migrant working-class families and veterans like Geronimo Pratt-are precisely the populations that have been targeted by for-profit colleges.) That access to upward mobility and exposure to new ideas comes at the moment of decolonization. The young people that are entering Merritt College in the early '60s do so as a dozen countries in Africa are winning their independence. They enter with a global sense of possibility and with an infrastructure of colleges to organize around. ER: How did this study group become so important? DM: In the 1960s, the fight for access to higher education was an extension of Black and Latinx liberation struggles. These were fights for access to state resources, whether it was aid for dependent children or access to higher education. They were trying to force open these programs, many of which could be traced back to the New Deal. In the case of California, these organizations wanted access to schools that had expanded funding during the Cold War. In the '60s and '70s, there was no tuition cost in the California public university system. That is the single most important fact. Why does that matter so much? Because many of the people who became important in the Black Panther Party didn't come from Black middle-class families. They were a step away from rural Southern poverty, like Huey Newton's family. Just by moving to the West Coast, they got access, and access to education became the laboratory for radical ideas in the lunchroom of Merritt College. So I started the book there and then thought about how people understood the problems of that era and about why it was so difficult to transmit this history to the subsequent generations. ER: Why was it so difficult? DM: Repression was the first obstacle to this form of Black radical and anti-capitalist organizing. The Black Panther Party was a self-avowed Marxist organization. They were explicitly anti-imperialist. They identified with the socialist Marxist revolutions of Cuba, Vietnam, and even the Chinese Maoist Revolution. And they supported a program of armed self-defense and redistribution. The campaign that was brought to bear against them from all levels of government-federal law enforcement, state, county, and city-led to a breaking apart of the party. The Black Panther Party still existed until 1980 or '81, but oppression directed at the party and its individual members narrowed their reach. Email The second obstacle came from the Panthers themselves. After the radical movements of the '60s, which some people called a cultural revolution that offered \"blaxploitation\" instead of real Black Power and Black radicalism, the issue of drugs surfaced. Party members in Oakland and Los Angeles that I interviewed felt that the most important assaults on their community occurred in both the War on Drugs and the drug crises themselves. Now, this varied by city. In New York City, heroin was more dominant and powerful in those postwar years than on the West Coast. But on the West Coast, a lot of people talked about crack. The crack crisis and the War on Drugs interrupted this movement. ER: Can you say more about this change? DM: Many people assume that life is always a story of things getting better. But in many ways, those first stories about the Panthers are about the Second Great Migration. What comes later is a very different kind of story. It's a story of people of two generations in cities where there has been systematic public defunding and an intensification of incarceration, policing, and repression. In that sense, I would say that it's best understood as part of the late 20th-century increased market governance and the withdrawing of resources from public institutions. Those kinds of resources don't exist today in the way that they did, especially in education. State defunding, the attack on teachers' unions, and the acceleration in California of segregation as the demographics began to change all contributed to reducing those resources. This is a version of what we're facing today: As populations of color grow, there's a limiting of resources. Although people look back to the Panthers, and it is important to have an idea of ancestry in politics, today we are facing a very different country, a different political economy, and a much more limited set of resources. ER: As you point out in your book, the end isn't quite the end. BLM harks back to the Panthers and to Assata. DM: The Black Lives Matter movement, and the broader Movement for Black Lives, chose Assata as the primary icon of their movement. They chose her image, but most importantly, they chose her words. They use a poem that was published in Cuba while she was in exile to open all of their meetings. \"It is our duty to fight for freedom. / It is our duty to win. / We must love and protect each other. / We have nothing to lose but our chains.\" That refrain is used in many kinds of meetings. They chose Assata for several reasons. Assata was a Black Panther Party member, but she was not from California. She was from New York, and she was a Southern migrant who came out of the Carolinas. She was also part of the New York party, which was purged from the larger national organization. The state repression against the Panthers was always terrible, but it was significantly worse in the largest cities in the United States. In New York City, there's [the incarceration of] the Panther 21. In Chicago, there's the assassination of Fred Hampton. And in Los Angeles, there's an attack on the Los Angeles chapter in 1969, which destroyed most of the aboveground party infrastructure. It's significant that the historical memory that they tapped into was through Assata Shakur. She emerges in part because she wrote an autobiography that allowed for broad dissemination when it was first published in 1987. And her autobiography, much more so than some of the other Panther autobiographies, is largely a story about incarceration. So much of it is descriptions of what it means to be a woman who was incarcerated. That really resonates, especially for younger generations: all the effects of these domestic Wars on Crime, on Drugs, on Gangs. But she is broken out of federal prison, becomes a fugitive, and then becomes an exile in Cuba. This is a story of liberation. Assata does the impossible. It is her history as fugitive and as exile that also lends a sense of hope and possibility for people who are fighting something very, very difficult: the American police state. ER: How did BLM frame that fight? DM: Recounting police killings and reclaiming the histories of those people became a core organizing strategy. The decision to understand Black death became the strategy, as opposed to police reform or other technocratic solutions. One of the reasons for its success is the way that it was able to demonstrate and mobilize around a series of violent murders and deaths as the logical extension of carceral policies over the last half-century. And it was the image and the reality of Michael Brown, having been murdered in North County in St. Louis and left in the street, that set St. Louis on fire. In many ways, that provided a template for things that would happen across the country. At the core of that was exposing police murder. ER: All the way until 2020. DM: Near the end of the book, I observe that \"We've had the largest number of protests ever in our history in 2020, with 26 million people going onto the streets and protesting in the name of Black Lives Matter.\" That encompassed 40 percent of the counties in the US. This is an amazing story of a different kind of genesis of a broad-based movement. And it has inserted abolition into mainstream discourse. Seeing corporate media and television talking about defunding the police and abolition were things that I never thought I would see. However, as I talk to you in the early weeks of 2022, we're seeing, as we have often in history, the ways in which law enforcement and the forces of reaction use this moment to expand powers and expand funding. One of the really disheartening things about writing about law enforcement is seeing this constant oscillation between organizing against it and reform and then increased powers. So often law enforcement uses the challenges that are posed to them to expand their powers. In this moment-the second year of Joe Biden's presidency and a year after the attack on January 6-we're seeing a real resurgence in law-and-order rhetoric and policy. ER: So what does Assata teach us? DM: In terms of thinking about the title of the book, Assata Taught Me , I mean it quite literally. Before it became the language of the movement, the book Assata , Assata Shakur's autobiography, taught us. In 1987, when it came out, we were living under the second administration of Ronald Reagan. This is the era of Iran-contra and of the invasion of Grenada and anti-communist warfare. (None of us knew that 1989 was coming.) But Assata represented this other possibility-this tradition of Black militants, of Marxism-linked to the anti-colonial struggle of Cuba, where she lives now. She literally taught me and people of my generation. And she has taught a subsequent generation, becoming the avatar and inspiration for new types of organizing against state violence, for demanding resources and funding, and for divesting from carceral projects and investing in education and health care. ER: And she does so globally. DM: In 2017, I visited the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. A graduate student who read my book asked me to come and give a talk to the group Occupy Alemão. Alemão is in North Rio. It's a part of a large complex of favelas of informal communities. I went to Zilda Chaves's house, which is essentially a community center there. Many of the people there were part of the first generation of students who were attending university. This was, in many ways, a dynamic that's not unlike the one I talked about in California: the first real generation of large numbers of college students of African descent. I talked to them about Assata, and they grilled me. They were deeply invested in reclaiming Assata Shakur for a tradition of Pan-Africanism that was recognizable to them and that evoked the history of their mothers, sisters, and daughters. During the conversation, there was a tension between pan-Africanism and Marxism, or even Angela Davis versus Assata Shakur. I forced myself to listen (because I had my own opinions). But it was a reminder of the importance of Assata in the diaspora. I'm still thinking about it. One of the reasons I have such a great affection for the Panthers is that they bring together those two traditions of Pan-Africanism and Marxism. They are an all-Black organization, and this is a very important development in the modern Black freedom struggle. At the same time, they really believed in radical coalitions and made common cause with white radicals, mother country radicals, and Brown Berets. At the core of that was anti-imperialism. Even though it's contested, I am invested in claiming Assata Shakur for both those traditions.\n\nSince that groundbreaking book's publication, Murch has become known as well for her distinguished essays on racial inequities in America. With a historian's eye for detail, she has tackled such subjects as the Movement for Black Lives, the opioid epidemic, and mass incarceration for The Boston Review . Her most recent book, Assata Taught Me , collects these and other writings about the development of the Movement for Black Lives as part of a longer history that dates back at least to the Black Panther Party and that has been especially inspired by the work and thought of Assata Shakur. Murch is currently an associate professor at Rutgers University, where she serves as the chapter president of her union. The Nation spoke with her earlier this year about her new book, her research on the crack epidemic, and the future of Black radical organizing against state violence. -Elias Rodriques E lias R odriques: What led you to write this book? D onna M urch: Most of these essays came about in a moment of joy and surprise. I was in Los Angeles from August 2013 through August 2015 to write a book called Crack in Los Angeles: Policing the Crisis in the War on Drugs . I am, in my heart, a social historian. I like to write about the places where I am, because I want the depth of experience that makes that kind of research possible. So I took this research trip. I conducted oral histories, went to different archives, and kept facing this conundrum: Even though there's a collective recognition of how damaging the Wars on Crime and Drugs were, people had difficulty mounting organized resistance to them. There were pockets of resistance and intellectuals. There were ways that people in their everyday lives resisted being criminalized. But finding organized resistance was difficult, despite the work of amazing people like the organizers of Coalition Against Police Abuse, Michael Zinzun, and others. Then, just as I arrived, there was this amazing arc that we've come to know as the Movement for Black Lives. It wasn't called that at the time, but that summer of 2013 [when people began using the hashtag #Blacklivesmatter on Twitter in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman] helped birth all these organizations.

ER: And she does so globally. DM: In 2017, I visited the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. A graduate student who read my book asked me to come and give a talk to the group Occupy Alemão. Alemão is in North Rio. It's a part of a large complex of favelas of informal communities. I went to Zilda Chaves's house, which is essentially a community center there. Many of the people there were part of the first generation of students who were attending university. This was, in many ways, a dynamic that's not unlike the one I talked about in California: the first real generation of large numbers of college students of African descent. I talked to them about Assata, and they grilled me. They were deeply invested in reclaiming Assata Shakur for a tradition of Pan-Africanism that was recognizable to them and that evoked the history of their mothers, sisters, and daughters. During the conversation, there was a tension between pan-Africanism and Marxism, or even Angela Davis versus Assata Shakur. I forced myself to listen (because I had my own opinions). But it was a reminder of the importance of Assata in the diaspora. I'm still thinking about it. One of the reasons I have such a great affection for the Panthers is that they bring together those two traditions of Pan-Africanism and Marxism. They are an all-Black organization, and this is a very important development in the modern Black freedom struggle. At the same time, they really believed in radical coalitions and made common cause with white radicals, mother country radicals, and Brown Berets. At the core of that was anti-imperialism. Even though it's contested, I am invested in claiming Assata Shakur for both those traditions.\n\n-Elias Rodriques E lias R odriques: What led you to write this book? D onna M urch: Most of these essays came about in a moment of joy and surprise. I was in Los Angeles from August 2013 through August 2015 to write a book called Crack in Los Angeles: Policing the Crisis in the War on Drugs . I am, in my heart, a social historian. I like to write about the places where I am, because I want the depth of experience that makes that kind of research possible. So I took this research trip. I conducted oral histories, went to different archives, and kept facing this conundrum: Even though there's a collective recognition of how damaging the Wars on Crime and Drugs were, people had difficulty mounting organized resistance to them. There were pockets of resistance and intellectuals. There were ways that people in their everyday lives resisted being criminalized. But finding organized resistance was difficult, despite the work of amazing people like the organizers of Coalition Against Police Abuse, Michael Zinzun, and others. Then, just as I arrived, there was this amazing arc that we've come to know as the Movement for Black Lives. It wasn't called that at the time, but that summer of 2013 [when people began using the hashtag #Blacklivesmatter on Twitter in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman] helped birth all these organizations. Out of excitement for that political movement, I wrote a series of essays, extending the timeline of the 1980s and '90s that I had been researching to think about this period: the second administration of Barack Obama and the last decade, where we have seen much of the organized resistance to these overlapping punishment campaigns.

DM: In terms of repression and resistance, it takes people and communities time to understand what is happening to them. Take the example of the modern civil rights movement: what became visible as the national civil rights movement emerged in the mid-1950s with Brown v. Board of Education . But the institutions and infrastructure for fighting that battle went back at least to the 1930s. Some would take it back to Reconstruction. There's a similar dynamic going on with the carceral state. I lived through this era. I was a teenager in the 1980s. And the way that we understand it now is very different. The level of criminalization and sensationalization and the definition of \"monsters\"-the language of \"crack babies\" and \"gang members\"-were at the center of the spectacle of punishment, so much so that they occluded the enormous violence of the state. It takes time for people to figure out how to mount resistance to something that, at the time, they may not even recognize is happening. It's very similar in the opioid crisis. Initially, these crises are understood as individual experiences, but to define them as a collective experience with culpable parties takes time. ER: You mentioned that you were a teenager at the time. What did you experience? DM: The first time I heard of crack, I was in college in the late '80s. I went home [to Erie, Pa.] to visit my parents and went to this doughnut shop on the east side of the city. This was one of the oldest parts of the city, with a lot of housing that had not been well maintained. It also had a giant industrial dumpsite. People didn't spend much time outside there in the winter, or even in the summer, for that matter. It always felt a little bit deserted. But we went to this doughnut shop in this neighborhood around midnight, just as the doughnuts were coming out. It was really cold, something like zero degrees, and there were all these little boys standing outside. I didn't have a context for understanding why they were there. It was only later, from talking to friends, that I realized that they were likely selling drugs. And I realized that a lot of the street-level drug economy is facilitated through young people. Arguably, a lot of it is child labor. It's not a sensational story, but it stands out in my mind because of their vulnerability: their vulnerability to the cold, their vulnerability in the part of the city that they were in, and the vulnerability that comes with being a young person working at midnight. ER: Let's keep moving back in time. Assata Taught Me begins with the uptick in the Great Migration in the 1940s and '50s. Why start there? DM: I wanted to think about an arc that connected the organizing and radical possibilities in the postwar social movements like the Black Panther Party with what happened in the years after their heyday and finally with the rise of the Movement for Black Lives. The essay that starts the collection is a genesis, explaining the origins of the Black Panthers. It's different from the way the Panthers were understood in the '80s and '90s. We now have Stanley Nelson's documentary about the party that was funded, partially, by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. This was unimaginable in the '90s. The Panthers were demonized. They were largely excluded from professional histories and history departments, and they were often talked about as criminals. But I wanted to start with a sense of radical possibilities as a factor in the '60s and '70s. At the time, people who became Panthers had migrated to California from Louisiana, Texas, and Arkansas. They were migrating for the opportunity for their children to attend high school, because many of the segregated cities and towns did not even have Black high schools. But in that period from the '40s through the early '70s, massive federal subsidies were poured into public education in California. California schools were much better resourced and funded than they are today. And in researching the genesis of the Black Panthers, I found something that surprised me: The Black Panther Party started with a study group, the Afro-American Association, at Merritt College in Oakland. If you look at the people that became important later-Oakland's first Black mayor, members of the Black Panther Party, Ron Karenga-they can all be traced back to this study group. ER: At a community college. DM: We don't talk nearly enough about community colleges. The majority of people in this country attend community colleges and get associate degrees. Then, and now, we need to look past this elite bias in the United States that takes small private schools as representative. This is a privileging of the wealthiest people in the country as the normative subjects, even though they have no real relationship to what life is really like in the United States. And their numbers are tiny. Containing the cost of expanding higher education in California was done by trying to create a pyramid with the broadest base being the community colleges, the mid-level being the state level colleges, and then the very top was the UC system. But Black students organized to use access to community colleges to figure out transfer rules to access the entire system of higher education. The study group and public schools are important parts of the stories of the '60s: poor and working-class kids accessing higher education without debt. (One of the most painful things is the way that these populations that became important to the formation of the Panthers-migrant working-class families and veterans like Geronimo Pratt-are precisely the populations that have been targeted by for-profit colleges.) That access to upward mobility and exposure to new ideas comes at the moment of decolonization. The young people that are entering Merritt College in the early '60s do so as a dozen countries in Africa are winning their independence. They enter with a global sense of possibility and with an infrastructure of colleges to organize around. ER: How did this study group become so important? DM: In the 1960s, the fight for access to higher education was an extension of Black and Latinx liberation struggles. These were fights for access to state resources, whether it was aid for dependent children or access to higher education. They were trying to force open these programs, many of which could be traced back to the New Deal. In the case of California, these organizations wanted access to schools that had expanded funding during the Cold War. In the '60s and '70s, there was no tuition cost in the California public university system. That is the single most important fact. Why does that matter so much? Because many of the people who became important in the Black Panther Party didn't come from Black middle-class families. They were a step away from rural Southern poverty, like Huey Newton's family. Just by moving to the West Coast, they got access, and access to education became the laboratory for radical ideas in the lunchroom of Merritt College. So I started the book there and then thought about how people understood the problems of that era and about why it was so difficult to transmit this history to the subsequent generations. ER: Why was it so difficult? DM: Repression was the first obstacle to this form of Black radical and anti-capitalist organizing. The Black Panther Party was a self-avowed Marxist organization. They were explicitly anti-imperialist. They identified with the socialist Marxist revolutions of Cuba, Vietnam, and even the Chinese Maoist Revolution. And they supported a program of armed self-defense and redistribution. The campaign that was brought to bear against them from all levels of government-federal law enforcement, state, county, and city-led to a breaking apart of the party. The Black Panther Party still existed until 1980 or '81, but oppression directed at the party and its individual members narrowed their reach. Email The second obstacle came from the Panthers themselves. After the radical movements of the '60s, which some people called a cultural revolution that offered \"blaxploitation\" instead of real Black Power and Black radicalism, the issue of drugs surfaced. Party members in Oakland and Los Angeles that I interviewed felt that the most important assaults on their community occurred in both the War on Drugs and the drug crises themselves. Now, this varied by city. In New York City, heroin was more dominant and powerful in those postwar years than on the West Coast. But on the West Coast, a lot of people talked about crack. The crack crisis and the War on Drugs interrupted this movement. ER: Can you say more about this change? DM: Many people assume that life is always a story of things getting better. But in many ways, those first stories about the Panthers are about the Second Great Migration. What comes later is a very different kind of story. It's a story of people of two generations in cities where there has been systematic public defunding and an intensification of incarceration, policing, and repression. In that sense, I would say that it's best understood as part of the late 20th-century increased market governance and the withdrawing of resources from public institutions. Those kinds of resources don't exist today in the way that they did, especially in education. State defunding, the attack on teachers' unions, and the acceleration in California of segregation as the demographics began to change all contributed to reducing those resources. This is a version of what we're facing today: As populations of color grow, there's a limiting of resources. Although people look back to the Panthers, and it is important to have an idea of ancestry in politics, today we are facing a very different country, a different political economy, and a much more limited set of resources. ER: As you point out in your book, the end isn't quite the end. BLM harks back to the Panthers and to Assata. DM: The Black Lives Matter movement, and the broader Movement for Black Lives, chose Assata as the primary icon of their movement. They chose her image, but most importantly, they chose her words. They use a poem that was published in Cuba while she was in exile to open all of their meetings. \"It is our duty to fight for freedom. / It is our duty to win. / We must love and protect each other. / We have nothing to lose but our chains.\" That refrain is used in many kinds of meetings. They chose Assata for several reasons. Assata was a Black Panther Party member, but she was not from California. She was from New York, and she was a Southern migrant who came out of the Carolinas. She was also part of the New York party, which was purged from the larger national organization. The state repression against the Panthers was always terrible, but it was significantly worse in the largest cities in the United States. In New York City, there's [the incarceration of] the Panther 21. In Chicago, there's the assassination of Fred Hampton. And in Los Angeles, there's an attack on the Los Angeles chapter in 1969, which destroyed most of the aboveground party infrastructure. It's significant that the historical memory that they tapped into was through Assata Shakur. She emerges in part because she wrote an autobiography that allowed for broad dissemination when it was first published in 1987. And her autobiography, much more so than some of the other Panther autobiographies, is largely a story about incarceration. So much of it is descriptions of what it means to be a woman who was incarcerated. That really resonates, especially for younger generations: all the effects of these domestic Wars on Crime, on Drugs, on Gangs. But she is broken out of federal prison, becomes a fugitive, and then becomes an exile in Cuba. This is a story of liberation. Assata does the impossible. It is her history as fugitive and as exile that also lends a sense of hope and possibility for people who are fighting something very, very difficult: the American police state. ER: How did BLM frame that fight? DM: Recounting police killings and reclaiming the histories of those people became a core organizing strategy. The decision to understand Black death became the strategy, as opposed to police reform or other technocratic solutions. One of the reasons for its success is the way that it was able to demonstrate and mobilize around a series of violent murders and deaths as the logical extension of carceral policies over the last half-century. And it was the image and the reality of Michael Brown, having been murdered in North County in St. Louis and left in the street, that set St. Louis on fire. In many ways, that provided a template for things that would happen across the country. At the core of that was exposing police murder. ER: All the way until 2020. DM: Near the end of the book, I observe that \"We've had the largest number of protests ever in our history in 2020, with 26 million people going onto the streets and protesting in the name of Black Lives Matter.\" That encompassed 40 percent of the counties in the US. This is an amazing story of a different kind of genesis of a broad-based movement. And it has inserted abolition into mainstream discourse. Seeing corporate media and television talking about defunding the police and abolition were things that I never thought I would see. However, as I talk to you in the early weeks of 2022, we're seeing, as we have often in history, the ways in which law enforcement and the forces of reaction use this moment to expand powers and expand funding. One of the really disheartening things about writing about law enforcement is seeing this constant oscillation between organizing against it and reform and then increased powers. So often law enforcement uses the challenges that are posed to them to expand their powers. In this moment-the second year of Joe Biden's presidency and a year after the attack on January 6-we're seeing a real resurgence in law-and-order rhetoric and policy. ER: So what does Assata teach us? DM: In terms of thinking about the title of the book, Assata Taught Me , I mean it quite literally. Before it became the language of the movement, the book Assata , Assata Shakur's autobiography, taught us. In 1987, when it came out, we were living under the second administration of Ronald Reagan. This is the era of Iran-contra and of the invasion of Grenada and anti-communist warfare. (None of us knew that 1989 was coming.) But Assata represented this other possibility-this tradition of Black militants, of Marxism-linked to the anti-colonial struggle of Cuba, where she lives now. She literally taught me and people of my generation. And she has taught a subsequent generation, becoming the avatar and inspiration for new types of organizing against state violence, for demanding resources and funding, and for divesting from carceral projects and investing in education and health care. ER: And she does so globally. DM: In 2017, I visited the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. A graduate student who read my book asked me to come and give a talk to the group Occupy Alemão. Alemão is in North Rio. It's a part of a large complex of favelas of informal communities. I went to Zilda Chaves's house, which is essentially a community center there. Many of the people there were part of the first generation of students who were attending university. This was, in many ways, a dynamic that's not unlike the one I talked about in California: the first real generation of large numbers of college students of African descent. I talked to them about Assata, and they grilled me. They were deeply invested in reclaiming Assata Shakur for a tradition of Pan-Africanism that was recognizable to them and that evoked the history of their mothers, sisters, and daughters.

But it was a reminder of the importance of Assata in the diaspora. I'm still thinking about it. One of the reasons I have such a great affection for the Panthers is that they bring together those two traditions of Pan-Africanism and Marxism. They are an all-Black organization, and this is a very important development in the modern Black freedom struggle. At the same time, they really believed in radical coalitions and made common cause with white radicals, mother country radicals, and Brown Berets. At the core of that was anti-imperialism. Even though it's contested, I am invested in claiming Assata Shakur for both those traditions.\n\nE lias R odriques: What led you to write this book?

And it was the image and the reality of Michael Brown, having been murdered in North County in St. Louis and left in the street, that set St. Louis on fire. In many ways, that provided a template for things that would happen across the country. At the core of that was exposing police murder. ER: All the way until 2020. DM: Near the end of the book, I observe that \"We've had the largest number of protests ever in our history in 2020, with 26 million people going onto the streets and protesting in the name of Black Lives Matter.\" That encompassed 40 percent of the counties in the US. This is an amazing story of a different kind of genesis of a broad-based movement. And it has inserted abolition into mainstream discourse. Seeing corporate media and television talking about defunding the police and abolition were things that I never thought I would see. However, as I talk to you in the early weeks of 2022, we're seeing, as we have often in history, the ways in which law enforcement and the forces of reaction use this moment to expand powers and expand funding. One of the really disheartening things about writing about law enforcement is seeing this constant oscillation between organizing against it and reform and then increased powers. So often law enforcement uses the challenges that are posed to them to expand their powers. In this moment-the second year of Joe Biden's presidency and a year after the attack on January 6-we're seeing a real resurgence in law-and-order rhetoric and policy. ER: So what does Assata teach us? DM: In terms of thinking about the title of the book, Assata Taught Me , I mean it quite literally. Before it became the language of the movement, the book Assata , Assata Shakur's autobiography, taught us. In 1987, when it came out, we were living under the second administration of Ronald Reagan. This is the era of Iran-contra and of the invasion of Grenada and anti-communist warfare. (None of us knew that 1989 was coming.) But Assata represented this other possibility-this tradition of Black militants, of Marxism-linked to the anti-colonial struggle of Cuba, where she lives now. She literally taught me and people of my generation. And she has taught a subsequent generation, becoming the avatar and inspiration for new types of organizing against state violence, for demanding resources and funding, and for divesting from carceral projects and investing in education and health care. ER: And she does so globally. DM: In 2017, I visited the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. A graduate student who read my book asked me to come and give a talk to the group Occupy Alemão. Alemão is in North Rio. It's a part of a large complex of favelas of informal communities. I went to Zilda Chaves's house, which is essentially a community center there. Many of the people there were part of the first generation of students who were attending university. This was, in many ways, a dynamic that's not unlike the one I talked about in California: the first real generation of large numbers of college students of African descent. I talked to them about Assata, and they grilled me. They were deeply invested in reclaiming Assata Shakur for a tradition of Pan-Africanism that was recognizable to them and that evoked the history of their mothers, sisters, and daughters. During the conversation, there was a tension between pan-Africanism and Marxism, or even Angela Davis versus Assata Shakur. I forced myself to listen (because I had my own opinions). But it was a reminder of the importance of Assata in the diaspora. I'm still thinking about it. One of the reasons I have such a great affection for the Panthers is that they bring together those two traditions of Pan-Africanism and Marxism. They are an all-Black organization, and this is a very important development in the modern Black freedom struggle. At the same time, they really believed in radical coalitions and made common cause with white radicals, mother country radicals, and Brown Berets. At the core of that was anti-imperialism. Even though it's contested, I am invested in claiming Assata Shakur for both those traditions.\n\nD onna M urch: Most of these essays came about in a moment of joy and surprise. I was in Los Angeles from August 2013 through August 2015 to write a book called Crack in Los Angeles: Policing the Crisis in the War on Drugs . I am, in my heart, a social historian. I like to write about the places where I am, because I want the depth of experience that makes that kind of research possible. So I took this research trip. I conducted oral histories, went to different archives, and kept facing this conundrum: Even though there's a collective recognition of how damaging the Wars on Crime and Drugs were, people had difficulty mounting organized resistance to them. There were pockets of resistance and intellectuals. There were ways that people in their everyday lives resisted being criminalized. But finding organized resistance was difficult, despite the work of amazing people like the organizers of Coalition Against Police Abuse, Michael Zinzun, and others. Then, just as I arrived, there was this amazing arc that we've come to know as the Movement for Black Lives. It wasn't called that at the time, but that summer of 2013 [when people began using the hashtag #Blacklivesmatter on Twitter in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman] helped birth all these organizations. Out of excitement for that political movement, I wrote a series of essays, extending the timeline of the 1980s and '90s that I had been researching to think about this period: the second administration of Barack Obama and the last decade, where we have seen much of the organized resistance to these overlapping punishment campaigns.

DM: In terms of repression and resistance, it takes people and communities time to understand what is happening to them. Take the example of the modern civil rights movement: what became visible as the national civil rights movement emerged in the mid-1950s with Brown v. Board of Education . But the institutions and infrastructure for fighting that battle went back at least to the 1930s. Some would take it back to Reconstruction. There's a similar dynamic going on with the carceral state. I lived through this era. I was a teenager in the 1980s. And the way that we understand it now is very different. The level of criminalization and sensationalization and the definition of \"monsters\"-the language of \"crack babies\" and \"gang members\"-were at the center of the spectacle of punishment, so much so that they occluded the enormous violence of the state. It takes time for people to figure out how to mount resistance to something that, at the time, they may not even recognize is happening. It's very similar in the opioid crisis. Initially, these crises are understood as individual experiences, but to define them as a collective experience with culpable parties takes time. ER: You mentioned that you were a teenager at the time. What did you experience? DM: The first time I heard of crack, I was in college in the late '80s. I went home [to Erie, Pa.] to visit my parents and went to this doughnut shop on the east side of the city. This was one of the oldest parts of the city, with a lot of housing that had not been well maintained. It also had a giant industrial dumpsite. People didn't spend much time outside there in the winter, or even in the summer, for that matter. It always felt a little bit deserted. But we went to this doughnut shop in this neighborhood around midnight, just as the doughnuts were coming out. It was really cold, something like zero degrees, and there were all these little boys standing outside. I didn't have a context for understanding why they were there. It was only later, from talking to friends, that I realized that they were likely selling drugs. And I realized that a lot of the street-level drug economy is facilitated through young people. Arguably, a lot of it is child labor. It's not a sensational story, but it stands out in my mind because of their vulnerability: their vulnerability to the cold, their vulnerability in the part of the city that they were in, and the vulnerability that comes with being a young person working at midnight. ER: Let's keep moving back in time. Assata Taught Me begins with the uptick in the Great Migration in the 1940s and '50s. Why start there? DM: I wanted to think about an arc that connected the organizing and radical possibilities in the postwar social movements like the Black Panther Party with what happened in the years after their heyday and finally with the rise of the Movement for Black Lives. The essay that starts the collection is a genesis, explaining the origins of the Black Panthers. It's different from the way the Panthers were understood in the '80s and '90s. We now have Stanley Nelson's documentary about the party that was funded, partially, by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. This was unimaginable in the '90s. The Panthers were demonized. They were largely excluded from professional histories and history departments, and they were often talked about as criminals. But I wanted to start with a sense of radical possibilities as a factor in the '60s and '70s. At the time, people who became Panthers had migrated to California from Louisiana, Texas, and Arkansas. They were migrating for the opportunity for their children to attend high school, because many of the segregated cities and towns did not even have Black high schools. But in that period from the '40s through the early '70s, massive federal subsidies were poured into public education in California. California schools were much better resourced and funded than they are today. And in researching the genesis of the Black Panthers, I found something that surprised me: The Black Panther Party started with a study group, the Afro-American Association, at Merritt College in Oakland. If you look at the people that became important later-Oakland's first Black mayor, members of the Black Panther Party, Ron Karenga-they can all be traced back to this study group. ER: At a community college. DM: We don't talk nearly enough about community colleges. The majority of people in this country attend community colleges and get associate degrees. Then, and now, we need to look past this elite bias in the United States that takes small private schools as representative. This is a privileging of the wealthiest people in the country as the normative subjects, even though they have no real relationship to what life is really like in the United States. And their numbers are tiny. Containing the cost of expanding higher education in California was done by trying to create a pyramid with the broadest base being the community colleges, the mid-level being the state level colleges, and then the very top was the UC system. But Black students organized to use access to community colleges to figure out transfer rules to access the entire system of higher education. The study group and public schools are important parts of the stories of the '60s: poor and working-class kids accessing higher education without debt. (One of the most painful things is the way that these populations that became important to the formation of the Panthers-migrant working-class families and veterans like Geronimo Pratt-are precisely the populations that have been targeted by for-profit colleges.) That access to upward mobility and exposure to new ideas comes at the moment of decolonization. The young people that are entering Merritt College in the early '60s do so as a dozen countries in Africa are winning their independence. They enter with a global sense of possibility and with an infrastructure of colleges to organize around. ER: How did this study group become so important? DM: In the 1960s, the fight for access to higher education was an extension of Black and Latinx liberation struggles. These were fights for access to state resources, whether it was aid for dependent children or access to higher education. They were trying to force open these programs, many of which could be traced back to the New Deal. In the case of California, these organizations wanted access to schools that had expanded funding during the Cold War. In the '60s and '70s, there was no tuition cost in the California public university system. That is the single most important fact. Why does that matter so much? Because many of the people who became important in the Black Panther Party didn't come from Black middle-class families. They were a step away from rural Southern poverty, like Huey Newton's family. Just by moving to the West Coast, they got access, and access to education became the laboratory for radical ideas in the lunchroom of Merritt College. So I started the book there and then thought about how people understood the problems of that era and about why it was so difficult to transmit this history to the subsequent generations. ER: Why was it so difficult? DM: Repression was the first obstacle to this form of Black radical and anti-capitalist organizing. The Black Panther Party was a self-avowed Marxist organization. They were explicitly anti-imperialist. They identified with the socialist Marxist revolutions of Cuba, Vietnam, and even the Chinese Maoist Revolution. And they supported a program of armed self-defense and redistribution. The campaign that was brought to bear against them from all levels of government-federal law enforcement, state, county, and city-led to a breaking apart of the party. The Black Panther Party still existed until 1980 or '81, but oppression directed at the party and its individual members narrowed their reach. Email The second obstacle came from the Panthers themselves. After the radical movements of the '60s, which some people called a cultural revolution that offered \"blaxploitation\" instead of real Black Power and Black radicalism, the issue of drugs surfaced. Party members in Oakland and Los Angeles that I interviewed felt that the most important assaults on their community occurred in both the War on Drugs and the drug crises themselves. Now, this varied by city. In New York City, heroin was more dominant and powerful in those postwar years than on the West Coast. But on the West Coast, a lot of people talked about crack. The crack crisis and the War on Drugs interrupted this movement. ER: Can you say more about this change? DM: Many people assume that life is always a story of things getting better. But in many ways, those first stories about the Panthers are about the Second Great Migration. What comes later is a very different kind of story. It's a story of people of two generations in cities where there has been systematic public defunding and an intensification of incarceration, policing, and repression. In that sense, I would say that it's best understood as part of the late 20th-century increased market governance and the withdrawing of resources from public institutions. Those kinds of resources don't exist today in the way that they did, especially in education. State defunding, the attack on teachers' unions, and the acceleration in California of segregation as the demographics began to change all contributed to reducing those resources. This is a version of what we're facing today: As populations of color grow, there's a limiting of resources. Although people look back to the Panthers, and it is important to have an idea of ancestry in politics, today we are facing a very different country, a different political economy, and a much more limited set of resources. ER: As you point out in your book, the end isn't quite the end. BLM harks back to the Panthers and to Assata. DM: The Black Lives Matter movement, and the broader Movement for Black Lives, chose Assata as the primary icon of their movement. They chose her image, but most importantly, they chose her words. They use a poem that was published in Cuba while she was in exile to open all of their meetings. \"It is our duty to fight for freedom. / It is our duty to win. / We must love and protect each other. / We have nothing to lose but our chains.\" That refrain is used in many kinds of meetings. They chose Assata for several reasons. Assata was a Black Panther Party member, but she was not from California. She was from New York, and she was a Southern migrant who came out of the Carolinas. She was also part of the New York party, which was purged from the larger national organization. The state repression against the Panthers was always terrible, but it was significantly worse in the largest cities in the United States. In New York City, there's [the incarceration of] the Panther 21. In Chicago, there's the assassination of Fred Hampton. And in Los Angeles, there's an attack on the Los Angeles chapter in 1969, which destroyed most of the aboveground party infrastructure. It's significant that the historical memory that they tapped into was through Assata Shakur. She emerges in part because she wrote an autobiography that allowed for broad dissemination when it was first published in 1987. And her autobiography, much more so than some of the other Panther autobiographies, is largely a story about incarceration. So much of it is descriptions of what it means to be a woman who was incarcerated. That really resonates, especially for younger generations: all the effects of these domestic Wars on Crime, on Drugs, on Gangs. But she is broken out of federal prison, becomes a fugitive, and then becomes an exile in Cuba. This is a story of liberation. Assata does the impossible. It is her history as fugitive and as exile that also lends a sense of hope and possibility for people who are fighting something very, very difficult: the American police state. ER: How did BLM frame that fight? DM: Recounting police killings and reclaiming the histories of those people became a core organizing strategy. The decision to understand Black death became the strategy, as opposed to police reform or other technocratic solutions. One of the reasons for its success is the way that it was able to demonstrate and mobilize around a series of violent murders and deaths as the logical extension of carceral policies over the last half-century. And it was the image and the reality of Michael Brown, having been murdered in North County in St. Louis and left in the street, that set St. Louis on fire. In many ways, that provided a template for things that would happen across the country. At the core of that was exposing police murder. ER: All the way until 2020. DM: Near the end of the book, I observe that \"We've had the largest number of protests ever in our history in 2020, with 26 million people going onto the streets and protesting in the name of Black Lives Matter.\" That encompassed 40 percent of the counties in the US.

And she has taught a subsequent generation, becoming the avatar and inspiration for new types of organizing against state violence, for demanding resources and funding, and for divesting from carceral projects and investing in education and health care. ER: And she does so globally. DM: In 2017, I visited the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. A graduate student who read my book asked me to come and give a talk to the group Occupy Alemão. Alemão is in North Rio. It's a part of a large complex of favelas of informal communities. I went to Zilda Chaves's house, which is essentially a community center there.

It's significant that the historical memory that they tapped into was through Assata Shakur. She emerges in part because she wrote an autobiography that allowed for broad dissemination when it was first published in 1987. And her autobiography, much more so than some of the other Panther autobiographies, is largely a story about incarceration. So much of it is descriptions of what it means to be a woman who was incarcerated. That really resonates, especially for younger generations: all the effects of these domestic Wars on Crime, on Drugs, on Gangs. But she is broken out of federal prison, becomes a fugitive, and then becomes an exile in Cuba. This is a story of liberation. Assata does the impossible. It is her history as fugitive and as exile that also lends a sense of hope and possibility for people who are fighting something very, very difficult: the American police state. ER: How did BLM frame that fight? DM: Recounting police killings and reclaiming the histories of those people became a core organizing strategy. The decision to understand Black death became the strategy, as opposed to police reform or other technocratic solutions. One of the reasons for its success is the way that it was able to demonstrate and mobilize around a series of violent murders and deaths as the logical extension of carceral policies over the last half-century. And it was the image and the reality of Michael Brown, having been murdered in North County in St. Louis and left in the street, that set St. Louis on fire. In many ways, that provided a template for things that would happen across the country. At the core of that was exposing police murder. ER: All the way until 2020. DM: Near the end of the book, I observe that \"We've had the largest number of protests ever in our history in 2020, with 26 million people going onto the streets and protesting in the name of Black Lives Matter.\" That encompassed 40 percent of the counties in the US. This is an amazing story of a different kind of genesis of a broad-based movement. And it has inserted abolition into mainstream discourse. Seeing corporate media and television talking about defunding the police and abolition were things that I never thought I would see. However, as I talk to you in the early weeks of 2022, we're seeing, as we have often in history, the ways in which law enforcement and the forces of reaction use this moment to expand powers and expand funding. One of the really disheartening things about writing about law enforcement is seeing this constant oscillation between organizing against it and reform and then increased powers. So often law enforcement uses the challenges that are posed to them to expand their powers. In this moment-the second year of Joe Biden's presidency and a year after the attack on January 6-we're seeing a real resurgence in law-and-order rhetoric and policy. ER: So what does Assata teach us? DM: In terms of thinking about the title of the book, Assata Taught Me , I mean it quite literally. Before it became the language of the movement, the book Assata , Assata Shakur's autobiography, taught us. In 1987, when it came out, we were living under the second administration of Ronald Reagan. This is the era of Iran-contra and of the invasion of Grenada and anti-communist warfare. (None of us knew that 1989 was coming.) But Assata represented this other possibility-this tradition of Black militants, of Marxism-linked to the anti-colonial struggle of Cuba, where she lives now. She literally taught me and people of my generation. And she has taught a subsequent generation, becoming the avatar and inspiration for new types of organizing against state violence, for demanding resources and funding, and for divesting from carceral projects and investing in education and health care. ER: And she does so globally. DM: In 2017, I visited the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. A graduate student who read my book asked me to come and give a talk to the group Occupy Alemão. Alemão is in North Rio. It's a part of a large complex of favelas of informal communities. I went to Zilda Chaves's house, which is essentially a community center there. Many of the people there were part of the first generation of students who were attending university. This was, in many ways, a dynamic that's not unlike the one I talked about in California: the first real generation of large numbers of college students of African descent. I talked to them about Assata, and they grilled me. They were deeply invested in reclaiming Assata Shakur for a tradition of Pan-Africanism that was recognizable to them and that evoked the history of their mothers, sisters, and daughters. During the conversation, there was a tension between pan-Africanism and Marxism, or even Angela Davis versus Assata Shakur. I forced myself to listen (because I had my own opinions). But it was a reminder of the importance of Assata in the diaspora. I'm still thinking about it. One of the reasons I have such a great affection for the Panthers is that they bring together those two traditions of Pan-Africanism and Marxism. They are an all-Black organization, and this is a very important development in the modern Black freedom struggle. At the same time, they really believed in radical coalitions and made common cause with white radicals, mother country radicals, and Brown Berets. At the core of that was anti-imperialism. Even though it's contested, I am invested in claiming Assata Shakur for both those traditions.\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nElie Mystal\n\nSaree Makdisi\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nElie Mystal\n\nSaree Makdisi\n\nER: What did you find from extending that timeline? DM: In terms of repression and resistance, it takes people and communities time to understand what is happening to them. Take the example of the modern civil rights movement: what became visible as the national civil rights movement emerged in the mid-1950s with Brown v. Board of Education . But the institutions and infrastructure for fighting that battle went back at least to the 1930s. Some would take it back to Reconstruction. There's a similar dynamic going on with the carceral state. I lived through this era. I was a teenager in the 1980s. And the way that we understand it now is very different. The level of criminalization and sensationalization and the definition of \"monsters\"-the language of \"crack babies\" and \"gang members\"-were at the center of the spectacle of punishment, so much so that they occluded the enormous violence of the state. It takes time for people to figure out how to mount resistance to something that, at the time, they may not even recognize is happening. It's very similar in the opioid crisis. Initially, these crises are understood as individual experiences, but to define them as a collective experience with culpable parties takes time. ER: You mentioned that you were a teenager at the time. What did you experience? DM: The first time I heard of crack, I was in college in the late '80s. I went home [to Erie, Pa.] to visit my parents and went to this doughnut shop on the east side of the city. This was one of the oldest parts of the city, with a lot of housing that had not been well maintained. It also had a giant industrial dumpsite. People didn't spend much time outside there in the winter, or even in the summer, for that matter. It always felt a little bit deserted. But we went to this doughnut shop in this neighborhood around midnight, just as the doughnuts were coming out. It was really cold, something like zero degrees, and there were all these little boys standing outside. I didn't have a context for understanding why they were there. It was only later, from talking to friends, that I realized that they were likely selling drugs. And I realized that a lot of the street-level drug economy is facilitated through young people. Arguably, a lot of it is child labor. It's not a sensational story, but it stands out in my mind because of their vulnerability: their vulnerability to the cold, their vulnerability in the part of the city that they were in, and the vulnerability that comes with being a young person working at midnight. ER: Let's keep moving back in time. Assata Taught Me begins with the uptick in the Great Migration in the 1940s and '50s. Why start there? DM: I wanted to think about an arc that connected the organizing and radical possibilities in the postwar social movements like the Black Panther Party with what happened in the years after their heyday and finally with the rise of the Movement for Black Lives. The essay that starts the collection is a genesis, explaining the origins of the Black Panthers. It's different from the way the Panthers were understood in the '80s and '90s. We now have Stanley Nelson's documentary about the party that was funded, partially, by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. This was unimaginable in the '90s. The Panthers were demonized. They were largely excluded from professional histories and history departments, and they were often talked about as criminals. But I wanted to start with a sense of radical possibilities as a factor in the '60s and '70s. At the time, people who became Panthers had migrated to California from Louisiana, Texas, and Arkansas. They were migrating for the opportunity for their children to attend high school, because many of the segregated cities and towns did not even have Black high schools. But in that period from the '40s through the early '70s, massive federal subsidies were poured into public education in California. California schools were much better resourced and funded than they are today. And in researching the genesis of the Black Panthers, I found something that surprised me: The Black Panther Party started with a study group, the Afro-American Association, at Merritt College in Oakland. If you look at the people that became important later-Oakland's first Black mayor, members of the Black Panther Party, Ron Karenga-they can all be traced back to this study group. ER: At a community college. DM: We don't talk nearly enough about community colleges. The majority of people in this country attend community colleges and get associate degrees. Then, and now, we need to look past this elite bias in the United States that takes small private schools as representative. This is a privileging of the wealthiest people in the country as the normative subjects, even though they have no real relationship to what life is really like in the United States. And their numbers are tiny. Containing the cost of expanding higher education in California was done by trying to create a pyramid with the broadest base being the community colleges, the mid-level being the state level colleges, and then the very top was the UC system. But Black students organized to use access to community colleges to figure out transfer rules to access the entire system of higher education. The study group and public schools are important parts of the stories of the '60s: poor and working-class kids accessing higher education without debt. (One of the most painful things is the way that these populations that became important to the formation of the Panthers-migrant working-class families and veterans like Geronimo Pratt-are precisely the populations that have been targeted by for-profit colleges.) That access to upward mobility and exposure to new ideas comes at the moment of decolonization. The young people that are entering Merritt College in the early '60s do so as a dozen countries in Africa are winning their independence. They enter with a global sense of possibility and with an infrastructure of colleges to organize around. ER: How did this study group become so important? DM: In the 1960s, the fight for access to higher education was an extension of Black and Latinx liberation struggles. These were fights for access to state resources, whether it was aid for dependent children or access to higher education. They were trying to force open these programs, many of which could be traced back to the New Deal. In the case of California, these organizations wanted access to schools that had expanded funding during the Cold War. In the '60s and '70s, there was no tuition cost in the California public university system. That is the single most important fact. Why does that matter so much? Because many of the people who became important in the Black Panther Party didn't come from Black middle-class families. They were a step away from rural Southern poverty, like Huey Newton's family. Just by moving to the West Coast, they got access, and access to education became the laboratory for radical ideas in the lunchroom of Merritt College. So I started the book there and then thought about how people understood the problems of that era and about why it was so difficult to transmit this history to the subsequent generations. ER: Why was it so difficult? DM: Repression was the first obstacle to this form of Black radical and anti-capitalist organizing. The Black Panther Party was a self-avowed Marxist organization. They were explicitly anti-imperialist. They identified with the socialist Marxist revolutions of Cuba, Vietnam, and even the Chinese Maoist Revolution. And they supported a program of armed self-defense and redistribution. The campaign that was brought to bear against them from all levels of government-federal law enforcement, state, county, and city-led to a breaking apart of the party. The Black Panther Party still existed until 1980 or '81, but oppression directed at the party and its individual members narrowed their reach. Email The second obstacle came from the Panthers themselves. After the radical movements of the '60s, which some people called a cultural revolution that offered \"blaxploitation\" instead of real Black Power and Black radicalism, the issue of drugs surfaced. Party members in Oakland and Los Angeles that I interviewed felt that the most important assaults on their community occurred in both the War on Drugs and the drug crises themselves. Now, this varied by city. In New York City, heroin was more dominant and powerful in those postwar years than on the West Coast. But on the West Coast, a lot of people talked about crack. The crack crisis and the War on Drugs interrupted this movement. ER: Can you say more about this change? DM: Many people assume that life is always a story of things getting better. But in many ways, those first stories about the Panthers are about the Second Great Migration. What comes later is a very different kind of story. It's a story of people of two generations in cities where there has been systematic public defunding and an intensification of incarceration, policing, and repression. In that sense, I would say that it's best understood as part of the late 20th-century increased market governance and the withdrawing of resources from public institutions. Those kinds of resources don't exist today in the way that they did, especially in education. State defunding, the attack on teachers' unions, and the acceleration in California of segregation as the demographics began to change all contributed to reducing those resources. This is a version of what we're facing today: As populations of color grow, there's a limiting of resources. Although people look back to the Panthers, and it is important to have an idea of ancestry in politics, today we are facing a very different country, a different political economy, and a much more limited set of resources. ER: As you point out in your book, the end isn't quite the end. BLM harks back to the Panthers and to Assata. DM: The Black Lives Matter movement, and the broader Movement for Black Lives, chose Assata as the primary icon of their movement. They chose her image, but most importantly, they chose her words. They use a poem that was published in Cuba while she was in exile to open all of their meetings. \"It is our duty to fight for freedom. / It is our duty to win. / We must love and protect each other. / We have nothing to lose but our chains.\" That refrain is used in many kinds of meetings. They chose Assata for several reasons. Assata was a Black Panther Party member, but she was not from California. She was from New York, and she was a Southern migrant who came out of the Carolinas. She was also part of the New York party, which was purged from the larger national organization. The state repression against the Panthers was always terrible, but it was significantly worse in the largest cities in the United States. In New York City, there's [the incarceration of] the Panther 21. In Chicago, there's the assassination of Fred Hampton. And in Los Angeles, there's an attack on the Los Angeles chapter in 1969, which destroyed most of the aboveground party infrastructure.

ER: So what does Assata teach us? DM: In terms of thinking about the title of the book, Assata Taught Me , I mean it quite literally. Before it became the language of the movement, the book Assata , Assata Shakur's autobiography, taught us. In 1987, when it came out, we were living under the second administration of Ronald Reagan. This is the era of Iran-contra and of the invasion of Grenada and anti-communist warfare. (None of us knew that 1989 was coming.) But Assata represented this other possibility-this tradition of Black militants, of Marxism-linked to the anti-colonial struggle of Cuba, where she lives now. She literally taught me and people of my generation. And she has taught a subsequent generation, becoming the avatar and inspiration for new types of organizing against state violence, for demanding resources and funding, and for divesting from carceral projects and investing in education and health care. ER: And she does so globally. DM: In 2017, I visited the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. A graduate student who read my book asked me to come and give a talk to the group Occupy Alemão. Alemão is in North Rio. It's a part of a large complex of favelas of informal communities. I went to Zilda Chaves's house, which is essentially a community center there. Many of the people there were part of the first generation of students who were attending university. This was, in many ways, a dynamic that's not unlike the one I talked about in California: the first real generation of large numbers of college students of African descent. I talked to them about Assata, and they grilled me. They were deeply invested in reclaiming Assata Shakur for a tradition of Pan-Africanism that was recognizable to them and that evoked the history of their mothers, sisters, and daughters. During the conversation, there was a tension between pan-Africanism and Marxism, or even Angela Davis versus Assata Shakur. I forced myself to listen (because I had my own opinions). But it was a reminder of the importance of Assata in the diaspora. I'm still thinking about it. One of the reasons I have such a great affection for the Panthers is that they bring together those two traditions of Pan-Africanism and Marxism. They are an all-Black organization, and this is a very important development in the modern Black freedom struggle. At the same time, they really believed in radical coalitions and made common cause with white radicals, mother country radicals, and Brown Berets. At the core of that was anti-imperialism. Even though it's contested, I am invested in claiming Assata Shakur for both those traditions.\n\nI lived through this era. I was a teenager in the 1980s. And the way that we understand it now is very different. The level of criminalization and sensationalization and the definition of \"monsters\"-the language of \"crack babies\" and \"gang members\"-were at the center of the spectacle of punishment, so much so that they occluded the enormous violence of the state. It takes time for people to figure out how to mount resistance to something that, at the time, they may not even recognize is happening. It's very similar in the opioid crisis. Initially, these crises are understood as individual experiences, but to define them as a collective experience with culpable parties takes time. ER: You mentioned that you were a teenager at the time. What did you experience? DM: The first time I heard of crack, I was in college in the late '80s. I went home [to Erie, Pa.] to visit my parents and went to this doughnut shop on the east side of the city. This was one of the oldest parts of the city, with a lot of housing that had not been well maintained. It also had a giant industrial dumpsite. People didn't spend much time outside there in the winter, or even in the summer, for that matter. It always felt a little bit deserted. But we went to this doughnut shop in this neighborhood around midnight, just as the doughnuts were coming out. It was really cold, something like zero degrees, and there were all these little boys standing outside. I didn't have a context for understanding why they were there. It was only later, from talking to friends, that I realized that they were likely selling drugs. And I realized that a lot of the street-level drug economy is facilitated through young people. Arguably, a lot of it is child labor. It's not a sensational story, but it stands out in my mind because of their vulnerability: their vulnerability to the cold, their vulnerability in the part of the city that they were in, and the vulnerability that comes with being a young person working at midnight. ER: Let's keep moving back in time. Assata Taught Me begins with the uptick in the Great Migration in the 1940s and '50s. Why start there? DM: I wanted to think about an arc that connected the organizing and radical possibilities in the postwar social movements like the Black Panther Party with what happened in the years after their heyday and finally with the rise of the Movement for Black Lives. The essay that starts the collection is a genesis, explaining the origins of the Black Panthers. It's different from the way the Panthers were understood in the '80s and '90s. We now have Stanley Nelson's documentary about the party that was funded, partially, by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. This was unimaginable in the '90s. The Panthers were demonized. They were largely excluded from professional histories and history departments, and they were often talked about as criminals. But I wanted to start with a sense of radical possibilities as a factor in the '60s and '70s. At the time, people who became Panthers had migrated to California from Louisiana, Texas, and Arkansas. They were migrating for the opportunity for their children to attend high school, because many of the segregated cities and towns did not even have Black high schools. But in that period from the '40s through the early '70s, massive federal subsidies were poured into public education in California. California schools were much better resourced and funded than they are today. And in researching the genesis of the Black Panthers, I found something that surprised me: The Black Panther Party started with a study group, the Afro-American Association, at Merritt College in Oakland. If you look at the people that became important later-Oakland's first Black mayor, members of the Black Panther Party, Ron Karenga-they can all be traced back to this study group. ER: At a community college. DM: We don't talk nearly enough about community colleges. The majority of people in this country attend community colleges and get associate degrees. Then, and now, we need to look past this elite bias in the United States that takes small private schools as representative. This is a privileging of the wealthiest people in the country as the normative subjects, even though they have no real relationship to what life is really like in the United States. And their numbers are tiny. Containing the cost of expanding higher education in California was done by trying to create a pyramid with the broadest base being the community colleges, the mid-level being the state level colleges, and then the very top was the UC system. But Black students organized to use access to community colleges to figure out transfer rules to access the entire system of higher education. The study group and public schools are important parts of the stories of the '60s: poor and working-class kids accessing higher education without debt. (One of the most painful things is the way that these populations that became important to the formation of the Panthers-migrant working-class families and veterans like Geronimo Pratt-are precisely the populations that have been targeted by for-profit colleges.) That access to upward mobility and exposure to new ideas comes at the moment of decolonization. The young people that are entering Merritt College in the early '60s do so as a dozen countries in Africa are winning their independence. They enter with a global sense of possibility and with an infrastructure of colleges to organize around. ER: How did this study group become so important? DM: In the 1960s, the fight for access to higher education was an extension of Black and Latinx liberation struggles. These were fights for access to state resources, whether it was aid for dependent children or access to higher education. They were trying to force open these programs, many of which could be traced back to the New Deal. In the case of California, these organizations wanted access to schools that had expanded funding during the Cold War. In the '60s and '70s, there was no tuition cost in the California public university system. That is the single most important fact. Why does that matter so much? Because many of the people who became important in the Black Panther Party didn't come from Black middle-class families. They were a step away from rural Southern poverty, like Huey Newton's family. Just by moving to the West Coast, they got access, and access to education became the laboratory for radical ideas in the lunchroom of Merritt College. So I started the book there and then thought about how people understood the problems of that era and about why it was so difficult to transmit this history to the subsequent generations. ER: Why was it so difficult? DM: Repression was the first obstacle to this form of Black radical and anti-capitalist organizing. The Black Panther Party was a self-avowed Marxist organization. They were explicitly anti-imperialist. They identified with the socialist Marxist revolutions of Cuba, Vietnam, and even the Chinese Maoist Revolution. And they supported a program of armed self-defense and redistribution. The campaign that was brought to bear against them from all levels of government-federal law enforcement, state, county, and city-led to a breaking apart of the party. The Black Panther Party still existed until 1980 or '81, but oppression directed at the party and its individual members narrowed their reach. Email The second obstacle came from the Panthers themselves. After the radical movements of the '60s, which some people called a cultural revolution that offered \"blaxploitation\" instead of real Black Power and Black radicalism, the issue of drugs surfaced. Party members in Oakland and Los Angeles that I interviewed felt that the most important assaults on their community occurred in both the War on Drugs and the drug crises themselves. Now, this varied by city. In New York City, heroin was more dominant and powerful in those postwar years than on the West Coast. But on the West Coast, a lot of people talked about crack. The crack crisis and the War on Drugs interrupted this movement. ER: Can you say more about this change? DM: Many people assume that life is always a story of things getting better. But in many ways, those first stories about the Panthers are about the Second Great Migration. What comes later is a very different kind of story. It's a story of people of two generations in cities where there has been systematic public defunding and an intensification of incarceration, policing, and repression. In that sense, I would say that it's best understood as part of the late 20th-century increased market governance and the withdrawing of resources from public institutions. Those kinds of resources don't exist today in the way that they did, especially in education. State defunding, the attack on teachers' unions, and the acceleration in California of segregation as the demographics began to change all contributed to reducing those resources. This is a version of what we're facing today: As populations of color grow, there's a limiting of resources. Although people look back to the Panthers, and it is important to have an idea of ancestry in politics, today we are facing a very different country, a different political economy, and a much more limited set of resources. ER: As you point out in your book, the end isn't quite the end. BLM harks back to the Panthers and to Assata. DM: The Black Lives Matter movement, and the broader Movement for Black Lives, chose Assata as the primary icon of their movement. They chose her image, but most importantly, they chose her words. They use a poem that was published in Cuba while she was in exile to open all of their meetings. \"It is our duty to fight for freedom. / It is our duty to win. / We must love and protect each other. / We have nothing to lose but our chains.\" That refrain is used in many kinds of meetings. They chose Assata for several reasons. Assata was a Black Panther Party member, but she was not from California. She was from New York, and she was a Southern migrant who came out of the Carolinas. She was also part of the New York party, which was purged from the larger national organization. The state repression against the Panthers was always terrible, but it was significantly worse in the largest cities in the United States. In New York City, there's [the incarceration of] the Panther 21. In Chicago, there's the assassination of Fred Hampton. And in Los Angeles, there's an attack on the Los Angeles chapter in 1969, which destroyed most of the aboveground party infrastructure. It's significant that the historical memory that they tapped into was through Assata Shakur. She emerges in part because she wrote an autobiography that allowed for broad dissemination when it was first published in 1987. And her autobiography, much more so than some of the other Panther autobiographies, is largely a story about incarceration. So much of it is descriptions of what it means to be a woman who was incarcerated. That really resonates, especially for younger generations: all the effects of these domestic Wars on Crime, on Drugs, on Gangs. But she is broken out of federal prison, becomes a fugitive, and then becomes an exile in Cuba. This is a story of liberation. Assata does the impossible. It is her history as fugitive and as exile that also lends a sense of hope and possibility for people who are fighting something very, very difficult: the American police state. ER: How did BLM frame that fight? DM: Recounting police killings and reclaiming the histories of those people became a core organizing strategy. The decision to understand Black death became the strategy, as opposed to police reform or other technocratic solutions. One of the reasons for its success is the way that it was able to demonstrate and mobilize around a series of violent murders and deaths as the logical extension of carceral policies over the last half-century. And it was the image and the reality of Michael Brown, having been murdered in North County in St. Louis and left in the street, that set St. Louis on fire. In many ways, that provided a template for things that would happen across the country. At the core of that was exposing police murder. ER: All the way until 2020. DM: Near the end of the book, I observe that \"We've had the largest number of protests ever in our history in 2020, with 26 million people going onto the streets and protesting in the name of Black Lives Matter.\" That encompassed 40 percent of the counties in the US. This is an amazing story of a different kind of genesis of a broad-based movement. And it has inserted abolition into mainstream discourse. Seeing corporate media and television talking about defunding the police and abolition were things that I never thought I would see. However, as I talk to you in the early weeks of 2022, we're seeing, as we have often in history, the ways in which law enforcement and the forces of reaction use this moment to expand powers and expand funding. One of the really disheartening things about writing about law enforcement is seeing this constant oscillation between organizing against it and reform and then increased powers. So often law enforcement uses the challenges that are posed to them to expand their powers. In this moment-the second year of Joe Biden's presidency and a year after the attack on January 6-we're seeing a real resurgence in law-and-order rhetoric and policy.

But I wanted to start with a sense of radical possibilities as a factor in the '60s and '70s. At the time, people who became Panthers had migrated to California from Louisiana, Texas, and Arkansas. They were migrating for the opportunity for their children to attend high school, because many of the segregated cities and towns did not even have Black high schools. But in that period from the '40s through the early '70s, massive federal subsidies were poured into public education in California. California schools were much better resourced and funded than they are today. And in researching the genesis of the Black Panthers, I found something that surprised me: The Black Panther Party started with a study group, the Afro-American Association, at Merritt College in Oakland. If you look at the people that became important later-Oakland's first Black mayor, members of the Black Panther Party, Ron Karenga-they can all be traced back to this study group. ER: At a community college. DM: We don't talk nearly enough about community colleges. The majority of people in this country attend community colleges and get associate degrees. Then, and now, we need to look past this elite bias in the United States that takes small private schools as representative. This is a privileging of the wealthiest people in the country as the normative subjects, even though they have no real relationship to what life is really like in the United States. And their numbers are tiny. Containing the cost of expanding higher education in California was done by trying to create a pyramid with the broadest base being the community colleges, the mid-level being the state level colleges, and then the very top was the UC system. But Black students organized to use access to community colleges to figure out transfer rules to access the entire system of higher education. The study group and public schools are important parts of the stories of the '60s: poor and working-class kids accessing higher education without debt. (One of the most painful things is the way that these populations that became important to the formation of the Panthers-migrant working-class families and veterans like Geronimo Pratt-are precisely the populations that have been targeted by for-profit colleges.) That access to upward mobility and exposure to new ideas comes at the moment of decolonization. The young people that are entering Merritt College in the early '60s do so as a dozen countries in Africa are winning their independence. They enter with a global sense of possibility and with an infrastructure of colleges to organize around. ER: How did this study group become so important? DM: In the 1960s, the fight for access to higher education was an extension of Black and Latinx liberation struggles. These were fights for access to state resources, whether it was aid for dependent children or access to higher education. They were trying to force open these programs, many of which could be traced back to the New Deal. In the case of California, these organizations wanted access to schools that had expanded funding during the Cold War. In the '60s and '70s, there was no tuition cost in the California public university system. That is the single most important fact. Why does that matter so much? Because many of the people who became important in the Black Panther Party didn't come from Black middle-class families. They were a step away from rural Southern poverty, like Huey Newton's family. Just by moving to the West Coast, they got access, and access to education became the laboratory for radical ideas in the lunchroom of Merritt College. So I started the book there and then thought about how people understood the problems of that era and about why it was so difficult to transmit this history to the subsequent generations. ER: Why was it so difficult? DM: Repression was the first obstacle to this form of Black radical and anti-capitalist organizing. The Black Panther Party was a self-avowed Marxist organization. They were explicitly anti-imperialist. They identified with the socialist Marxist revolutions of Cuba, Vietnam, and even the Chinese Maoist Revolution. And they supported a program of armed self-defense and redistribution. The campaign that was brought to bear against them from all levels of government-federal law enforcement, state, county, and city-led to a breaking apart of the party. The Black Panther Party still existed until 1980 or '81, but oppression directed at the party and its individual members narrowed their reach. Email The second obstacle came from the Panthers themselves. After the radical movements of the '60s, which some people called a cultural revolution that offered \"blaxploitation\" instead of real Black Power and Black radicalism, the issue of drugs surfaced. Party members in Oakland and Los Angeles that I interviewed felt that the most important assaults on their community occurred in both the War on Drugs and the drug crises themselves. Now, this varied by city. In New York City, heroin was more dominant and powerful in those postwar years than on the West Coast. But on the West Coast, a lot of people talked about crack. The crack crisis and the War on Drugs interrupted this movement. ER: Can you say more about this change? DM: Many people assume that life is always a story of things getting better. But in many ways, those first stories about the Panthers are about the Second Great Migration. What comes later is a very different kind of story. It's a story of people of two generations in cities where there has been systematic public defunding and an intensification of incarceration, policing, and repression. In that sense, I would say that it's best understood as part of the late 20th-century increased market governance and the withdrawing of resources from public institutions. Those kinds of resources don't exist today in the way that they did, especially in education. State defunding, the attack on teachers' unions, and the acceleration in California of segregation as the demographics began to change all contributed to reducing those resources. This is a version of what we're facing today: As populations of color grow, there's a limiting of resources. Although people look back to the Panthers, and it is important to have an idea of ancestry in politics, today we are facing a very different country, a different political economy, and a much more limited set of resources. ER: As you point out in your book, the end isn't quite the end. BLM harks back to the Panthers and to Assata. DM: The Black Lives Matter movement, and the broader Movement for Black Lives, chose Assata as the primary icon of their movement. They chose her image, but most importantly, they chose her words. They use a poem that was published in Cuba while she was in exile to open all of their meetings. \"It is our duty to fight for freedom. / It is our duty to win. / We must love and protect each other. / We have nothing to lose but our chains.\" That refrain is used in many kinds of meetings. They chose Assata for several reasons. Assata was a Black Panther Party member, but she was not from California. She was from New York, and she was a Southern migrant who came out of the Carolinas. She was also part of the New York party, which was purged from the larger national organization. The state repression against the Panthers was always terrible, but it was significantly worse in the largest cities in the United States. In New York City, there's [the incarceration of] the Panther 21. In Chicago, there's the assassination of Fred Hampton. And in Los Angeles, there's an attack on the Los Angeles chapter in 1969, which destroyed most of the aboveground party infrastructure. It's significant that the historical memory that they tapped into was through Assata Shakur. She emerges in part because she wrote an autobiography that allowed for broad dissemination when it was first published in 1987. And her autobiography, much more so than some of the other Panther autobiographies, is largely a story about incarceration. So much of it is descriptions of what it means to be a woman who was incarcerated. That really resonates, especially for younger generations: all the effects of these domestic Wars on Crime, on Drugs, on Gangs. But she is broken out of federal prison, becomes a fugitive, and then becomes an exile in Cuba. This is a story of liberation. Assata does the impossible. It is her history as fugitive and as exile that also lends a sense of hope and possibility for people who are fighting something very, very difficult: the American police state. ER: How did BLM frame that fight? DM: Recounting police killings and reclaiming the histories of those people became a core organizing strategy. The decision to understand Black death became the strategy, as opposed to police reform or other technocratic solutions. One of the reasons for its success is the way that it was able to demonstrate and mobilize around a series of violent murders and deaths as the logical extension of carceral policies over the last half-century. And it was the image and the reality of Michael Brown, having been murdered in North County in St. Louis and left in the street, that set St. Louis on fire. In many ways, that provided a template for things that would happen across the country. At the core of that was exposing police murder. ER: All the way until 2020. DM: Near the end of the book, I observe that \"We've had the largest number of protests ever in our history in 2020, with 26 million people going onto the streets and protesting in the name of Black Lives Matter.\" That encompassed 40 percent of the counties in the US. This is an amazing story of a different kind of genesis of a broad-based movement. And it has inserted abolition into mainstream discourse. Seeing corporate media and television talking about defunding the police and abolition were things that I never thought I would see. However, as I talk to you in the early weeks of 2022, we're seeing, as we have often in history, the ways in which law enforcement and the forces of reaction use this moment to expand powers and expand funding. One of the really disheartening things about writing about law enforcement is seeing this constant oscillation between organizing against it and reform and then increased powers. So often law enforcement uses the challenges that are posed to them to expand their powers. In this moment-the second year of Joe Biden's presidency and a year after the attack on January 6-we're seeing a real resurgence in law-and-order rhetoric and policy. ER: So what does Assata teach us? DM: In terms of thinking about the title of the book, Assata Taught Me , I mean it quite literally. Before it became the language of the movement, the book Assata , Assata Shakur's autobiography, taught us. In 1987, when it came out, we were living under the second administration of Ronald Reagan. This is the era of Iran-contra and of the invasion of Grenada and anti-communist warfare. (None of us knew that 1989 was coming.) But Assata represented this other possibility-this tradition of Black militants, of Marxism-linked to the anti-colonial struggle of Cuba, where she lives now. She literally taught me and people of my generation. And she has taught a subsequent generation, becoming the avatar and inspiration for new types of organizing against state violence, for demanding resources and funding, and for divesting from carceral projects and investing in education and health care. ER: And she does so globally. DM: In 2017, I visited the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. A graduate student who read my book asked me to come and give a talk to the group Occupy Alemão. Alemão is in North Rio. It's a part of a large complex of favelas of informal communities. I went to Zilda Chaves's house, which is essentially a community center there. Many of the people there were part of the first generation of students who were attending university. This was, in many ways, a dynamic that's not unlike the one I talked about in California: the first real generation of large numbers of college students of African descent. I talked to them about Assata, and they grilled me. They were deeply invested in reclaiming Assata Shakur for a tradition of Pan-Africanism that was recognizable to them and that evoked the history of their mothers, sisters, and daughters. During the conversation, there was a tension between pan-Africanism and Marxism, or even Angela Davis versus Assata Shakur. I forced myself to listen (because I had my own opinions). But it was a reminder of the importance of Assata in the diaspora. I'm still thinking about it. One of the reasons I have such a great affection for the Panthers is that they bring together those two traditions of Pan-Africanism and Marxism. They are an all-Black organization, and this is a very important development in the modern Black freedom struggle. At the same time, they really believed in radical coalitions and made common cause with white radicals, mother country radicals, and Brown Berets. At the core of that was anti-imperialism. Even though it's contested, I am invested in claiming Assata Shakur for both those traditions.\n\nER: Let's keep moving back in time. Assata Taught Me begins with the uptick in the Great Migration in the 1940s and '50s. Why start there? DM: I wanted to think about an arc that connected the organizing and radical possibilities in the postwar social movements like the Black Panther Party with what happened in the years after their heyday and finally with the rise of the Movement for Black Lives. The essay that starts the collection is a genesis, explaining the origins of the Black Panthers. It's different from the way the Panthers were understood in the '80s and '90s. We now have Stanley Nelson's documentary about the party that was funded, partially, by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. This was unimaginable in the '90s. The Panthers were demonized.

The decision to understand Black death became the strategy, as opposed to police reform or other technocratic solutions. One of the reasons for its success is the way that it was able to demonstrate and mobilize around a series of violent murders and deaths as the logical extension of carceral policies over the last half-century. And it was the image and the reality of Michael Brown, having been murdered in North County in St. Louis and left in the street, that set St. Louis on fire. In many ways, that provided a template for things that would happen across the country. At the core of that was exposing police murder. ER: All the way until 2020. DM: Near the end of the book, I observe that \"We've had the largest number of protests ever in our history in 2020, with 26 million people going onto the streets and protesting in the name of Black Lives Matter.\" That encompassed 40 percent of the counties in the US. This is an amazing story of a different kind of genesis of a broad-based movement. And it has inserted abolition into mainstream discourse. Seeing corporate media and television talking about defunding the police and abolition were things that I never thought I would see. However, as I talk to you in the early weeks of 2022, we're seeing, as we have often in history, the ways in which law enforcement and the forces of reaction use this moment to expand powers and expand funding. One of the really disheartening things about writing about law enforcement is seeing this constant oscillation between organizing against it and reform and then increased powers. So often law enforcement uses the challenges that are posed to them to expand their powers. In this moment-the second year of Joe Biden's presidency and a year after the attack on January 6-we're seeing a real resurgence in law-and-order rhetoric and policy. ER: So what does Assata teach us? DM: In terms of thinking about the title of the book, Assata Taught Me , I mean it quite literally. Before it became the language of the movement, the book Assata , Assata Shakur's autobiography, taught us. In 1987, when it came out, we were living under the second administration of Ronald Reagan. This is the era of Iran-contra and of the invasion of Grenada and anti-communist warfare. (None of us knew that 1989 was coming.) But Assata represented this other possibility-this tradition of Black militants, of Marxism-linked to the anti-colonial struggle of Cuba, where she lives now. She literally taught me and people of my generation. And she has taught a subsequent generation, becoming the avatar and inspiration for new types of organizing against state violence, for demanding resources and funding, and for divesting from carceral projects and investing in education and health care. ER: And she does so globally. DM: In 2017, I visited the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. A graduate student who read my book asked me to come and give a talk to the group Occupy Alemão. Alemão is in North Rio. It's a part of a large complex of favelas of informal communities. I went to Zilda Chaves's house, which is essentially a community center there. Many of the people there were part of the first generation of students who were attending university. This was, in many ways, a dynamic that's not unlike the one I talked about in California: the first real generation of large numbers of college students of African descent. I talked to them about Assata, and they grilled me. They were deeply invested in reclaiming Assata Shakur for a tradition of Pan-Africanism that was recognizable to them and that evoked the history of their mothers, sisters, and daughters. During the conversation, there was a tension between pan-Africanism and Marxism, or even Angela Davis versus Assata Shakur. I forced myself to listen (because I had my own opinions). But it was a reminder of the importance of Assata in the diaspora. I'm still thinking about it. One of the reasons I have such a great affection for the Panthers is that they bring together those two traditions of Pan-Africanism and Marxism. They are an all-Black organization, and this is a very important development in the modern Black freedom struggle. At the same time, they really believed in radical coalitions and made common cause with white radicals, mother country radicals, and Brown Berets. At the core of that was anti-imperialism. Even though it's contested, I am invested in claiming Assata Shakur for both those traditions.\n\nAt the time, people who became Panthers had migrated to California from Louisiana, Texas, and Arkansas. They were migrating for the opportunity for their children to attend high school, because many of the segregated cities and towns did not even have Black high schools. But in that period from the '40s through the early '70s, massive federal subsidies were poured into public education in California. California schools were much better resourced and funded than they are today. And in researching the genesis of the Black Panthers, I found something that surprised me: The Black Panther Party started with a study group, the Afro-American Association, at Merritt College in Oakland. If you look at the people that became important later-Oakland's first Black mayor, members of the Black Panther Party, Ron Karenga-they can all be traced back to this study group. ER: At a community college. DM: We don't talk nearly enough about community colleges. The majority of people in this country attend community colleges and get associate degrees. Then, and now, we need to look past this elite bias in the United States that takes small private schools as representative. This is a privileging of the wealthiest people in the country as the normative subjects, even though they have no real relationship to what life is really like in the United States. And their numbers are tiny. Containing the cost of expanding higher education in California was done by trying to create a pyramid with the broadest base being the community colleges, the mid-level being the state level colleges, and then the very top was the UC system. But Black students organized to use access to community colleges to figure out transfer rules to access the entire system of higher education. The study group and public schools are important parts of the stories of the '60s: poor and working-class kids accessing higher education without debt. (One of the most painful things is the way that these populations that became important to the formation of the Panthers-migrant working-class families and veterans like Geronimo Pratt-are precisely the populations that have been targeted by for-profit colleges.) That access to upward mobility and exposure to new ideas comes at the moment of decolonization. The young people that are entering Merritt College in the early '60s do so as a dozen countries in Africa are winning their independence. They enter with a global sense of possibility and with an infrastructure of colleges to organize around. ER: How did this study group become so important? DM: In the 1960s, the fight for access to higher education was an extension of Black and Latinx liberation struggles. These were fights for access to state resources, whether it was aid for dependent children or access to higher education. They were trying to force open these programs, many of which could be traced back to the New Deal. In the case of California, these organizations wanted access to schools that had expanded funding during the Cold War. In the '60s and '70s, there was no tuition cost in the California public university system. That is the single most important fact. Why does that matter so much? Because many of the people who became important in the Black Panther Party didn't come from Black middle-class families. They were a step away from rural Southern poverty, like Huey Newton's family. Just by moving to the West Coast, they got access, and access to education became the laboratory for radical ideas in the lunchroom of Merritt College. So I started the book there and then thought about how people understood the problems of that era and about why it was so difficult to transmit this history to the subsequent generations. ER: Why was it so difficult? DM: Repression was the first obstacle to this form of Black radical and anti-capitalist organizing. The Black Panther Party was a self-avowed Marxist organization. They were explicitly anti-imperialist. They identified with the socialist Marxist revolutions of Cuba, Vietnam, and even the Chinese Maoist Revolution. And they supported a program of armed self-defense and redistribution. The campaign that was brought to bear against them from all levels of government-federal law enforcement, state, county, and city-led to a breaking apart of the party. The Black Panther Party still existed until 1980 or '81, but oppression directed at the party and its individual members narrowed their reach. Email The second obstacle came from the Panthers themselves. After the radical movements of the '60s, which some people called a cultural revolution that offered \"blaxploitation\" instead of real Black Power and Black radicalism, the issue of drugs surfaced. Party members in Oakland and Los Angeles that I interviewed felt that the most important assaults on their community occurred in both the War on Drugs and the drug crises themselves. Now, this varied by city. In New York City, heroin was more dominant and powerful in those postwar years than on the West Coast. But on the West Coast, a lot of people talked about crack. The crack crisis and the War on Drugs interrupted this movement. ER: Can you say more about this change? DM: Many people assume that life is always a story of things getting better. But in many ways, those first stories about the Panthers are about the Second Great Migration. What comes later is a very different kind of story. It's a story of people of two generations in cities where there has been systematic public defunding and an intensification of incarceration, policing, and repression. In that sense, I would say that it's best understood as part of the late 20th-century increased market governance and the withdrawing of resources from public institutions. Those kinds of resources don't exist today in the way that they did, especially in education. State defunding, the attack on teachers' unions, and the acceleration in California of segregation as the demographics began to change all contributed to reducing those resources. This is a version of what we're facing today: As populations of color grow, there's a limiting of resources. Although people look back to the Panthers, and it is important to have an idea of ancestry in politics, today we are facing a very different country, a different political economy, and a much more limited set of resources. ER: As you point out in your book, the end isn't quite the end. BLM harks back to the Panthers and to Assata. DM: The Black Lives Matter movement, and the broader Movement for Black Lives, chose Assata as the primary icon of their movement. They chose her image, but most importantly, they chose her words. They use a poem that was published in Cuba while she was in exile to open all of their meetings. \"It is our duty to fight for freedom. / It is our duty to win. / We must love and protect each other. / We have nothing to lose but our chains.\" That refrain is used in many kinds of meetings. They chose Assata for several reasons. Assata was a Black Panther Party member, but she was not from California. She was from New York, and she was a Southern migrant who came out of the Carolinas. She was also part of the New York party, which was purged from the larger national organization. The state repression against the Panthers was always terrible, but it was significantly worse in the largest cities in the United States. In New York City, there's [the incarceration of] the Panther 21. In Chicago, there's the assassination of Fred Hampton. And in Los Angeles, there's an attack on the Los Angeles chapter in 1969, which destroyed most of the aboveground party infrastructure. It's significant that the historical memory that they tapped into was through Assata Shakur. She emerges in part because she wrote an autobiography that allowed for broad dissemination when it was first published in 1987. And her autobiography, much more so than some of the other Panther autobiographies, is largely a story about incarceration. So much of it is descriptions of what it means to be a woman who was incarcerated. That really resonates, especially for younger generations: all the effects of these domestic Wars on Crime, on Drugs, on Gangs. But she is broken out of federal prison, becomes a fugitive, and then becomes an exile in Cuba. This is a story of liberation. Assata does the impossible. It is her history as fugitive and as exile that also lends a sense of hope and possibility for people who are fighting something very, very difficult: the American police state. ER: How did BLM frame that fight? DM: Recounting police killings and reclaiming the histories of those people became a core organizing strategy.

It's significant that the historical memory that they tapped into was through Assata Shakur. She emerges in part because she wrote an autobiography that allowed for broad dissemination when it was first published in 1987. And her autobiography, much more so than some of the other Panther autobiographies, is largely a story about incarceration. So much of it is descriptions of what it means to be a woman who was incarcerated. That really resonates, especially for younger generations: all the effects of these domestic Wars on Crime, on Drugs, on Gangs. But she is broken out of federal prison, becomes a fugitive, and then becomes an exile in Cuba. This is a story of liberation. Assata does the impossible. It is her history as fugitive and as exile that also lends a sense of hope and possibility for people who are fighting something very, very difficult: the American police state. ER: How did BLM frame that fight? DM: Recounting police killings and reclaiming the histories of those people became a core organizing strategy. The decision to understand Black death became the strategy, as opposed to police reform or other technocratic solutions. One of the reasons for its success is the way that it was able to demonstrate and mobilize around a series of violent murders and deaths as the logical extension of carceral policies over the last half-century. And it was the image and the reality of Michael Brown, having been murdered in North County in St. Louis and left in the street, that set St. Louis on fire. In many ways, that provided a template for things that would happen across the country. At the core of that was exposing police murder. ER: All the way until 2020. DM: Near the end of the book, I observe that \"We've had the largest number of protests ever in our history in 2020, with 26 million people going onto the streets and protesting in the name of Black Lives Matter.\" That encompassed 40 percent of the counties in the US. This is an amazing story of a different kind of genesis of a broad-based movement. And it has inserted abolition into mainstream discourse. Seeing corporate media and television talking about defunding the police and abolition were things that I never thought I would see. However, as I talk to you in the early weeks of 2022, we're seeing, as we have often in history, the ways in which law enforcement and the forces of reaction use this moment to expand powers and expand funding. One of the really disheartening things about writing about law enforcement is seeing this constant oscillation between organizing against it and reform and then increased powers. So often law enforcement uses the challenges that are posed to them to expand their powers. In this moment-the second year of Joe Biden's presidency and a year after the attack on January 6-we're seeing a real resurgence in law-and-order rhetoric and policy. ER: So what does Assata teach us? DM: In terms of thinking about the title of the book, Assata Taught Me , I mean it quite literally. Before it became the language of the movement, the book Assata , Assata Shakur's autobiography, taught us. In 1987, when it came out, we were living under the second administration of Ronald Reagan. This is the era of Iran-contra and of the invasion of Grenada and anti-communist warfare. (None of us knew that 1989 was coming.) But Assata represented this other possibility-this tradition of Black militants, of Marxism-linked to the anti-colonial struggle of Cuba, where she lives now. She literally taught me and people of my generation. And she has taught a subsequent generation, becoming the avatar and inspiration for new types of organizing against state violence, for demanding resources and funding, and for divesting from carceral projects and investing in education and health care. ER: And she does so globally. DM: In 2017, I visited the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. A graduate student who read my book asked me to come and give a talk to the group Occupy Alemão. Alemão is in North Rio. It's a part of a large complex of favelas of informal communities. I went to Zilda Chaves's house, which is essentially a community center there. Many of the people there were part of the first generation of students who were attending university. This was, in many ways, a dynamic that's not unlike the one I talked about in California: the first real generation of large numbers of college students of African descent. I talked to them about Assata, and they grilled me. They were deeply invested in reclaiming Assata Shakur for a tradition of Pan-Africanism that was recognizable to them and that evoked the history of their mothers, sisters, and daughters. During the conversation, there was a tension between pan-Africanism and Marxism, or even Angela Davis versus Assata Shakur. I forced myself to listen (because I had my own opinions). But it was a reminder of the importance of Assata in the diaspora. I'm still thinking about it. One of the reasons I have such a great affection for the Panthers is that they bring together those two traditions of Pan-Africanism and Marxism. They are an all-Black organization, and this is a very important development in the modern Black freedom struggle. At the same time, they really believed in radical coalitions and made common cause with white radicals, mother country radicals, and Brown Berets. At the core of that was anti-imperialism. Even though it's contested, I am invested in claiming Assata Shakur for both those traditions.\n\nContaining the cost of expanding higher education in California was done by trying to create a pyramid with the broadest base being the community colleges, the mid-level being the state level colleges, and then the very top was the UC system. But Black students organized to use access to community colleges to figure out transfer rules to access the entire system of higher education. The study group and public schools are important parts of the stories of the '60s: poor and working-class kids accessing higher education without debt. (One of the most painful things is the way that these populations that became important to the formation of the Panthers-migrant working-class families and veterans like Geronimo Pratt-are precisely the populations that have been targeted by for-profit colleges.) That access to upward mobility and exposure to new ideas comes at the moment of decolonization. The young people that are entering Merritt College in the early '60s do so as a dozen countries in Africa are winning their independence. They enter with a global sense of possibility and with an infrastructure of colleges to organize around. ER: How did this study group become so important? DM: In the 1960s, the fight for access to higher education was an extension of Black and Latinx liberation struggles. These were fights for access to state resources, whether it was aid for dependent children or access to higher education. They were trying to force open these programs, many of which could be traced back to the New Deal. In the case of California, these organizations wanted access to schools that had expanded funding during the Cold War. In the '60s and '70s, there was no tuition cost in the California public university system. That is the single most important fact. Why does that matter so much? Because many of the people who became important in the Black Panther Party didn't come from Black middle-class families. They were a step away from rural Southern poverty, like Huey Newton's family. Just by moving to the West Coast, they got access, and access to education became the laboratory for radical ideas in the lunchroom of Merritt College. So I started the book there and then thought about how people understood the problems of that era and about why it was so difficult to transmit this history to the subsequent generations. ER: Why was it so difficult? DM: Repression was the first obstacle to this form of Black radical and anti-capitalist organizing. The Black Panther Party was a self-avowed Marxist organization. They were explicitly anti-imperialist. They identified with the socialist Marxist revolutions of Cuba, Vietnam, and even the Chinese Maoist Revolution. And they supported a program of armed self-defense and redistribution. The campaign that was brought to bear against them from all levels of government-federal law enforcement, state, county, and city-led to a breaking apart of the party. The Black Panther Party still existed until 1980 or '81, but oppression directed at the party and its individual members narrowed their reach. Email The second obstacle came from the Panthers themselves. After the radical movements of the '60s, which some people called a cultural revolution that offered \"blaxploitation\" instead of real Black Power and Black radicalism, the issue of drugs surfaced. Party members in Oakland and Los Angeles that I interviewed felt that the most important assaults on their community occurred in both the War on Drugs and the drug crises themselves. Now, this varied by city. In New York City, heroin was more dominant and powerful in those postwar years than on the West Coast. But on the West Coast, a lot of people talked about crack. The crack crisis and the War on Drugs interrupted this movement. ER: Can you say more about this change? DM: Many people assume that life is always a story of things getting better. But in many ways, those first stories about the Panthers are about the Second Great Migration. What comes later is a very different kind of story. It's a story of people of two generations in cities where there has been systematic public defunding and an intensification of incarceration, policing, and repression. In that sense, I would say that it's best understood as part of the late 20th-century increased market governance and the withdrawing of resources from public institutions. Those kinds of resources don't exist today in the way that they did, especially in education. State defunding, the attack on teachers' unions, and the acceleration in California of segregation as the demographics began to change all contributed to reducing those resources. This is a version of what we're facing today: As populations of color grow, there's a limiting of resources. Although people look back to the Panthers, and it is important to have an idea of ancestry in politics, today we are facing a very different country, a different political economy, and a much more limited set of resources. ER: As you point out in your book, the end isn't quite the end. BLM harks back to the Panthers and to Assata. DM: The Black Lives Matter movement, and the broader Movement for Black Lives, chose Assata as the primary icon of their movement. They chose her image, but most importantly, they chose her words. They use a poem that was published in Cuba while she was in exile to open all of their meetings. \"It is our duty to fight for freedom. / It is our duty to win. / We must love and protect each other. / We have nothing to lose but our chains.\" That refrain is used in many kinds of meetings. They chose Assata for several reasons. Assata was a Black Panther Party member, but she was not from California. She was from New York, and she was a Southern migrant who came out of the Carolinas. She was also part of the New York party, which was purged from the larger national organization. The state repression against the Panthers was always terrible, but it was significantly worse in the largest cities in the United States. In New York City, there's [the incarceration of] the Panther 21. In Chicago, there's the assassination of Fred Hampton. And in Los Angeles, there's an attack on the Los Angeles chapter in 1969, which destroyed most of the aboveground party infrastructure.

But Assata represented this other possibility-this tradition of Black militants, of Marxism-linked to the anti-colonial struggle of Cuba, where she lives now. She literally taught me and people of my generation. And she has taught a subsequent generation, becoming the avatar and inspiration for new types of organizing against state violence, for demanding resources and funding, and for divesting from carceral projects and investing in education and health care. ER: And she does so globally. DM: In 2017, I visited the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. A graduate student who read my book asked me to come and give a talk to the group Occupy Alemão. Alemão is in North Rio. It's a part of a large complex of favelas of informal communities. I went to Zilda Chaves's house, which is essentially a community center there. Many of the people there were part of the first generation of students who were attending university. This was, in many ways, a dynamic that's not unlike the one I talked about in California: the first real generation of large numbers of college students of African descent. I talked to them about Assata, and they grilled me. They were deeply invested in reclaiming Assata Shakur for a tradition of Pan-Africanism that was recognizable to them and that evoked the history of their mothers, sisters, and daughters. During the conversation, there was a tension between pan-Africanism and Marxism, or even Angela Davis versus Assata Shakur. I forced myself to listen (because I had my own opinions). But it was a reminder of the importance of Assata in the diaspora. I'm still thinking about it. One of the reasons I have such a great affection for the Panthers is that they bring together those two traditions of Pan-Africanism and Marxism. They are an all-Black organization, and this is a very important development in the modern Black freedom struggle. At the same time, they really believed in radical coalitions and made common cause with white radicals, mother country radicals, and Brown Berets. At the core of that was anti-imperialism. Even though it's contested, I am invested in claiming Assata Shakur for both those traditions.\n\nER: Why was it so difficult? DM: Repression was the first obstacle to this form of Black radical and anti-capitalist organizing. The Black Panther Party was a self-avowed Marxist organization. They were explicitly anti-imperialist. They identified with the socialist Marxist revolutions of Cuba, Vietnam, and even the Chinese Maoist Revolution. And they supported a program of armed self-defense and redistribution. The campaign that was brought to bear against them from all levels of government-federal law enforcement, state, county, and city-led to a breaking apart of the party. The Black Panther Party still existed until 1980 or '81, but oppression directed at the party and its individual members narrowed their reach. Email The second obstacle came from the Panthers themselves. After the radical movements of the '60s, which some people called a cultural revolution that offered \"blaxploitation\" instead of real Black Power and Black radicalism, the issue of drugs surfaced. Party members in Oakland and Los Angeles that I interviewed felt that the most important assaults on their community occurred in both the War on Drugs and the drug crises themselves. Now, this varied by city. In New York City, heroin was more dominant and powerful in those postwar years than on the West Coast. But on the West Coast, a lot of people talked about crack. The crack crisis and the War on Drugs interrupted this movement. ER: Can you say more about this change? DM: Many people assume that life is always a story of things getting better. But in many ways, those first stories about the Panthers are about the Second Great Migration. What comes later is a very different kind of story. It's a story of people of two generations in cities where there has been systematic public defunding and an intensification of incarceration, policing, and repression. In that sense, I would say that it's best understood as part of the late 20th-century increased market governance and the withdrawing of resources from public institutions. Those kinds of resources don't exist today in the way that they did, especially in education. State defunding, the attack on teachers' unions, and the acceleration in California of segregation as the demographics began to change all contributed to reducing those resources. This is a version of what we're facing today: As populations of color grow, there's a limiting of resources. Although people look back to the Panthers, and it is important to have an idea of ancestry in politics, today we are facing a very different country, a different political economy, and a much more limited set of resources. ER: As you point out in your book, the end isn't quite the end. BLM harks back to the Panthers and to Assata. DM: The Black Lives Matter movement, and the broader Movement for Black Lives, chose Assata as the primary icon of their movement. They chose her image, but most importantly, they chose her words. They use a poem that was published in Cuba while she was in exile to open all of their meetings. \"It is our duty to fight for freedom. / It is our duty to win. / We must love and protect each other. / We have nothing to lose but our chains.\" That refrain is used in many kinds of meetings. They chose Assata for several reasons. Assata was a Black Panther Party member, but she was not from California. She was from New York, and she was a Southern migrant who came out of the Carolinas. She was also part of the New York party, which was purged from the larger national organization. The state repression against the Panthers was always terrible, but it was significantly worse in the largest cities in the United States. In New York City, there's [the incarceration of] the Panther 21. In Chicago, there's the assassination of Fred Hampton. And in Los Angeles, there's an attack on the Los Angeles chapter in 1969, which destroyed most of the aboveground party infrastructure. It's significant that the historical memory that they tapped into was through Assata Shakur. She emerges in part because she wrote an autobiography that allowed for broad dissemination when it was first published in 1987. And her autobiography, much more so than some of the other Panther autobiographies, is largely a story about incarceration. So much of it is descriptions of what it means to be a woman who was incarcerated. That really resonates, especially for younger generations: all the effects of these domestic Wars on Crime, on Drugs, on Gangs. But she is broken out of federal prison, becomes a fugitive, and then becomes an exile in Cuba. This is a story of liberation. Assata does the impossible. It is her history as fugitive and as exile that also lends a sense of hope and possibility for people who are fighting something very, very difficult: the American police state. ER: How did BLM frame that fight? DM: Recounting police killings and reclaiming the histories of those people became a core organizing strategy. The decision to understand Black death became the strategy, as opposed to police reform or other technocratic solutions. One of the reasons for its success is the way that it was able to demonstrate and mobilize around a series of violent murders and deaths as the logical extension of carceral policies over the last half-century. And it was the image and the reality of Michael Brown, having been murdered in North County in St. Louis and left in the street, that set St. Louis on fire. In many ways, that provided a template for things that would happen across the country. At the core of that was exposing police murder. ER: All the way until 2020. DM: Near the end of the book, I observe that \"We've had the largest number of protests ever in our history in 2020, with 26 million people going onto the streets and protesting in the name of Black Lives Matter.\" That encompassed 40 percent of the counties in the US. This is an amazing story of a different kind of genesis of a broad-based movement. And it has inserted abolition into mainstream discourse. Seeing corporate media and television talking about defunding the police and abolition were things that I never thought I would see. However, as I talk to you in the early weeks of 2022, we're seeing, as we have often in history, the ways in which law enforcement and the forces of reaction use this moment to expand powers and expand funding. One of the really disheartening things about writing about law enforcement is seeing this constant oscillation between organizing against it and reform and then increased powers. So often law enforcement uses the challenges that are posed to them to expand their powers. In this moment-the second year of Joe Biden's presidency and a year after the attack on January 6-we're seeing a real resurgence in law-and-order rhetoric and policy.

ER: And she does so globally. DM: In 2017, I visited the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. A graduate student who read my book asked me to come and give a talk to the group Occupy Alemão. Alemão is in North Rio. It's a part of a large complex of favelas of informal communities. I went to Zilda Chaves's house, which is essentially a community center there. Many of the people there were part of the first generation of students who were attending university. This was, in many ways, a dynamic that's not unlike the one I talked about in California: the first real generation of large numbers of college students of African descent. I talked to them about Assata, and they grilled me. They were deeply invested in reclaiming Assata Shakur for a tradition of Pan-Africanism that was recognizable to them and that evoked the history of their mothers, sisters, and daughters. During the conversation, there was a tension between pan-Africanism and Marxism, or even Angela Davis versus Assata Shakur. I forced myself to listen (because I had my own opinions). But it was a reminder of the importance of Assata in the diaspora. I'm still thinking about it. One of the reasons I have such a great affection for the Panthers is that they bring together those two traditions of Pan-Africanism and Marxism. They are an all-Black organization, and this is a very important development in the modern Black freedom struggle. At the same time, they really believed in radical coalitions and made common cause with white radicals, mother country radicals, and Brown Berets. At the core of that was anti-imperialism. Even though it's contested, I am invested in claiming Assata Shakur for both those traditions.\n\nDM: Many people assume that life is always a story of things getting better. But in many ways, those first stories about the Panthers are about the Second Great Migration. What comes later is a very different kind of story. It's a story of people of two generations in cities where there has been systematic public defunding and an intensification of incarceration, policing, and repression. In that sense, I would say that it's best understood as part of the late 20th-century increased market governance and the withdrawing of resources from public institutions. Those kinds of resources don't exist today in the way that they did, especially in education. State defunding, the attack on teachers' unions, and the acceleration in California of segregation as the demographics began to change all contributed to reducing those resources. This is a version of what we're facing today: As populations of color grow, there's a limiting of resources. Although people look back to the Panthers, and it is important to have an idea of ancestry in politics, today we are facing a very different country, a different political economy, and a much more limited set of resources. ER: As you point out in your book, the end isn't quite the end. BLM harks back to the Panthers and to Assata. DM: The Black Lives Matter movement, and the broader Movement for Black Lives, chose Assata as the primary icon of their movement. They chose her image, but most importantly, they chose her words. They use a poem that was published in Cuba while she was in exile to open all of their meetings. \"It is our duty to fight for freedom. / It is our duty to win. / We must love and protect each other. / We have nothing to lose but our chains.\" That refrain is used in many kinds of meetings. They chose Assata for several reasons. Assata was a Black Panther Party member, but she was not from California. She was from New York, and she was a Southern migrant who came out of the Carolinas. She was also part of the New York party, which was purged from the larger national organization. The state repression against the Panthers was always terrible, but it was significantly worse in the largest cities in the United States. In New York City, there's [the incarceration of] the Panther 21. In Chicago, there's the assassination of Fred Hampton. And in Los Angeles, there's an attack on the Los Angeles chapter in 1969, which destroyed most of the aboveground party infrastructure. It's significant that the historical memory that they tapped into was through Assata Shakur. She emerges in part because she wrote an autobiography that allowed for broad dissemination when it was first published in 1987. And her autobiography, much more so than some of the other Panther autobiographies, is largely a story about incarceration. So much of it is descriptions of what it means to be a woman who was incarcerated. That really resonates, especially for younger generations: all the effects of these domestic Wars on Crime, on Drugs, on Gangs. But she is broken out of federal prison, becomes a fugitive, and then becomes an exile in Cuba. This is a story of liberation. Assata does the impossible. It is her history as fugitive and as exile that also lends a sense of hope and possibility for people who are fighting something very, very difficult: the American police state. ER: How did BLM frame that fight? DM: Recounting police killings and reclaiming the histories of those people became a core organizing strategy. The decision to understand Black death became the strategy, as opposed to police reform or other technocratic solutions. One of the reasons for its success is the way that it was able to demonstrate and mobilize around a series of violent murders and deaths as the logical extension of carceral policies over the last half-century. And it was the image and the reality of Michael Brown, having been murdered in North County in St. Louis and left in the street, that set St. Louis on fire. In many ways, that provided a template for things that would happen across the country. At the core of that was exposing police murder. ER: All the way until 2020. DM: Near the end of the book, I observe that \"We've had the largest number of protests ever in our history in 2020, with 26 million people going onto the streets and protesting in the name of Black Lives Matter.\" That encompassed 40 percent of the counties in the US. This is an amazing story of a different kind of genesis of a broad-based movement. And it has inserted abolition into mainstream discourse. Seeing corporate media and television talking about defunding the police and abolition were things that I never thought I would see. However, as I talk to you in the early weeks of 2022, we're seeing, as we have often in history, the ways in which law enforcement and the forces of reaction use this moment to expand powers and expand funding. One of the really disheartening things about writing about law enforcement is seeing this constant oscillation between organizing against it and reform and then increased powers. So often law enforcement uses the challenges that are posed to them to expand their powers. In this moment-the second year of Joe Biden's presidency and a year after the attack on January 6-we're seeing a real resurgence in law-and-order rhetoric and policy. ER: So what does Assata teach us? DM: In terms of thinking about the title of the book, Assata Taught Me , I mean it quite literally. Before it became the language of the movement, the book Assata , Assata Shakur's autobiography, taught us. In 1987, when it came out, we were living under the second administration of Ronald Reagan. This is the era of Iran-contra and of the invasion of Grenada and anti-communist warfare. (None of us knew that 1989 was coming.) But Assata represented this other possibility-this tradition of Black militants, of Marxism-linked to the anti-colonial struggle of Cuba, where she lives now. She literally taught me and people of my generation.

But Assata represented this other possibility-this tradition of Black militants, of Marxism-linked to the anti-colonial struggle of Cuba, where she lives now. She literally taught me and people of my generation. And she has taught a subsequent generation, becoming the avatar and inspiration for new types of organizing against state violence, for demanding resources and funding, and for divesting from carceral projects and investing in education and health care. ER: And she does so globally. DM: In 2017, I visited the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. A graduate student who read my book asked me to come and give a talk to the group Occupy Alemão. Alemão is in North Rio. It's a part of a large complex of favelas of informal communities. I went to Zilda Chaves's house, which is essentially a community center there. Many of the people there were part of the first generation of students who were attending university. This was, in many ways, a dynamic that's not unlike the one I talked about in California: the first real generation of large numbers of college students of African descent. I talked to them about Assata, and they grilled me. They were deeply invested in reclaiming Assata Shakur for a tradition of Pan-Africanism that was recognizable to them and that evoked the history of their mothers, sisters, and daughters. During the conversation, there was a tension between pan-Africanism and Marxism, or even Angela Davis versus Assata Shakur. I forced myself to listen (because I had my own opinions). But it was a reminder of the importance of Assata in the diaspora. I'm still thinking about it. One of the reasons I have such a great affection for the Panthers is that they bring together those two traditions of Pan-Africanism and Marxism. They are an all-Black organization, and this is a very important development in the modern Black freedom struggle. At the same time, they really believed in radical coalitions and made common cause with white radicals, mother country radicals, and Brown Berets. At the core of that was anti-imperialism. Even though it's contested, I am invested in claiming Assata Shakur for both those traditions.\n\nER: All the way until 2020. DM: Near the end of the book, I observe that \"We've had the largest number of protests ever in our history in 2020, with 26 million people going onto the streets and protesting in the name of Black Lives Matter.\" That encompassed 40 percent of the counties in the US. This is an amazing story of a different kind of genesis of a broad-based movement. And it has inserted abolition into mainstream discourse. Seeing corporate media and television talking about defunding the police and abolition were things that I never thought I would see. However, as I talk to you in the early weeks of 2022, we're seeing, as we have often in history, the ways in which law enforcement and the forces of reaction use this moment to expand powers and expand funding. One of the really disheartening things about writing about law enforcement is seeing this constant oscillation between organizing against it and reform and then increased powers. So often law enforcement uses the challenges that are posed to them to expand their powers. In this moment-the second year of Joe Biden's presidency and a year after the attack on January 6-we're seeing a real resurgence in law-and-order rhetoric and policy.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Their demonstration was destined for an ignominious demise far from any main thoroughfare, out of sight of most apartment buildings, out of earshot of most homes, best viewed from a dinghy bobbing in the Hudson River. Those at the head of the march had other ideas. After a brief stop at city hall, they turned the crowd onto the main drag, Washington Street, and for the next few hours, a parade of protesters snaked through Hoboken, N.J. \"Whose streets? Our streets!\" is a well-worn activist chant, but for a little while it was true as Hoboken's motorcycle cops played catch-up and the march turned this way and that-first, uptown on Washington, where a conspicuous minority of businesses were boarded up, expecting trouble that never came. Then, a left onto Sixth, another onto Jackson. Monroe. Park. Finally, back to Washington and onward. All the while, the voices of the mostly white marchers, being led in call-and-response chants mainly by people of color, rang through the streets and echoed off high-rent low-rises. \"Hands up! Don't shoot!\" \"No justice! No peace!\" \"Say his name! George Floyd!\" Current Issue View our current issue As an ever-more middle-aged white guy who, a decade ago, traded covering US protests for reporting from African war zones , I have little of substance to add to the superlative coverage of the Black Lives Matter demonstrations that have erupted across the country in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd. For that, read some of the journalists who are on the front lines innovating and elevating the craft, like the great Aviva Stahl 's real-time eyewitness observations, incisive interviews , and on-the-fly fact-checking , while marching for miles and miles through the streets of Brooklyn, N.Y. Instead, bear with me while I ruminate about something I said to Tom Engelhardt, the editor of this website, TomDispatch , at the beginning of March when our lives changed forever. Instead of simply bemoaning the onslaught of the Covid-19 pandemic-however devastating and deadly it might prove to be-I uncharacteristically looked on the bright side, suggesting that this could be one of those rare transformative moments that shifts the world's axis and leads to revolutionary change.

It's desperately difficult for any of us to predict the future and yet, thanks so often to the long, hard, and sometimes remarkably dangerous work of organizers and activists, even the most seemingly immutable things can change over time and under the right conditions. A Latter-Day Lynching Despite my comments to Tom, if you had told me that, in the span of a few months, a novel coronavirus that dates back only to last year and systemic American racism that dates back to 1619 would somehow intersect, I wouldn't have believed it. If you had told me that a man named George Floyd would survive Covid-19 only to be murdered by the police and that his brutal death would spark a worldwide movement, leading the council members of a major American city to announce their intent to defund the police and Europeans halfway across the planet to deface monuments to a murderous 19 century monarch who slaughtered Africans, I would have dismissed you. But history works in mysterious ways. Four hundred years of racism, systemic abuse of authority, unpunished police misconduct , white skin privilege, and a host of other evils at the dark core of America gave a white Minneapolis police officer the license to press a black man's face to the pavement and jam a knee into his neck for nearly nine minutes. For allegedly attempting to buy a pack of cigarettes with a phony $20 bill, George Floyd was killed at the intersection of 38th Street and Chicago Avenue in Minneapolis, Minn., by police officer Derek Chauvin. At the beginning of the last century, whites could murder a black man , woman, or child in this country as part of a public celebration, memorialize it on postcards , and mail them to friends. Between 1877 and 1950 , nearly 4,000 blacks were lynched in the American South, more than a death a week for 73 years. But the murders of blacks, whether at the hands of their owners in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries or of unaccountable fellow Americans in the latter 19th and 20th centuries never ended despite changes in some attitudes, significant federal legislation, and the notable successes of the protests, marches, and activism of the civil rights movement of the 1960s. From 2006 to 2012 , in fact, a white police officer killed a black person in America almost twice a week, according to FBI statistics. And less than a month before we watched the last moments of George Floyd's life, we witnessed a modern-day version of a lynching when Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old black man, was gunned down while jogging on a suburban street in Glynn County, Ga. Gregory McMichael, a 64-year-old white retired district attorney, investigator, and police detective, and his son Travis, 34, were eventually arrested and charged with his murder. Without the Covid-19 pandemic and the Trump administration's botched response to it, without black Americans' dying of the disease at three times the rate of whites, without the suddenly spotlighted health disparities that have always consigned people of color to die at elevated rates, without a confluence of so many horrors that the black community in America has suffered for so long coupled with those of a new virus, would we be in the place we're in today? If President Trump hadn't cheered on the efforts of mostly older white protesters to end pandemic shutdowns and \"liberate\" their states and then echoed a racist Miami police chief of the 1960s who promised \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts,\" essentially calling for young black protesters to be gunned down, would the present movement have taken off in such a way? And would these protests have been as powerful if people who had avoided outside contact for weeks hadn't suddenly decided to risk their own lives and those of others around them because this murder was too brazen, too likely to end in injustice for private handwringing and public hashtags? In Minneapolis, where George Floyd drew his last embattled breath, a veto-proof majority of the city council recently announced their commitment to disbanding the city's police department. As council president Lisa Bender put it: \"We're here because we hear you. We are here today because George Floyd was killed by the Minneapolis police. We are here because here in Minneapolis and in cities across the United States it is clear that our existing system of policing and public safety is not keeping our communities safe. Our efforts at incremental reform have failed. Period.\" A month ago, such a statement by almost any council chief in any American city-much less similar sentiments voiced across the nation-would have been essentially unthinkable. Only small numbers of activists working away with tiny chisels on a mountain of official intransigence could even have imagined such a thing and they would have been dismissed by the punditocracy as delusional. But the reverberations of George Floyd's death have hardly been confined to the city where he was slain or even the country whose systemic bigotry put a target on his back for 46 years. His death and America's rampant racism have led to soul-searching across the globe, sparking protests against discrimination and police brutality from Australia to Germany, Argentina to Kenya . In Ghent, Belgium, a bust honoring King Leopold II was defaced and covered with a hood bearing Floyd's dying plea: \"I can't breathe.\" In Antwerp, Leopold's statue was set on fire and later removed. It was Leopold, as TomDispatch regular Adam Hochschild so memorably documented in King Leopold's Ghost , who, in the late 19th century, seized the vast territory surrounding Africa's Congo River, looted its rubber, brutalized its people, and presided over a fin de siècle holocaust that took the lives of as many as 10 million people, roughly half the Congo's population. Belgian activists are now calling for all the country's statues and monuments to the murderous monarch to be torn down. A Cultural Renaissance or a Societal Black Death? Like the island off its coast , Hoboken was born of a great swindle. In 1658, the Dutch governor of Manhattan reportedly bought the tract of land that now includes that mile-square New Jersey city from the Lenape people for some wampum, cloth, kettles, blankets, six guns and-fittingly enough, given Hoboken's startling bars-to-area ratio- half a barrel of beer . In other words, the city where I covered that demonstration is part and parcel of the settler colonialism, slavery, and racism that forms the bedrock of this nation. But even in that white enclave, that bastion of 21st century gentrification, in the midst of a lethal global pandemic with no cure, 10,000 people flooded its parks and streets, carrying signs like \"Racism is a pandemic, too\" and \"Covid is not the only killer\" that would have made little sense six months ago. There were also posters that would have been shocking in Hoboken only several weeks ago, but didn't cause anyone to bat an eye, like \"ACAB\" (an acronym for \"All Cops are Bastards\") or Are you a: [ ] Killer cop [ ] Complicit Cop Not to mention dozens and dozens of signs reading \"Defund the Police\" or \"Abolish the Police.\" Suddenly- to most of us, at least -such proposals were on the table. In reality, social change rarely occurs by accident or chance. It usually comes in the wake of years of relentless, thankless, grinding activism. It also takes a willingness to head for the barricades when history has illuminated the dangers of doing so. It requires persistence in the face of weariness and distraction, and courage in the face of abject adversity. Where this movement goes, how it changes this nation, and what it spawns around the world will be won or lost on the streets of our tomorrows. Will it mean an America that inches closer to long-articulated but never remotely approached ideals, or usher in a backlash that leads to a wave of politicians in the Trumpian mold? In moments like this, there's no way of knowing whether you're on the cusp of a cultural renaissance or a societal Black Death. It takes a long time, but Earth's orbit and axis do change, and once they do, things are never the same again. Already, from Minneapolis to Antwerp to modest Hoboken, this world is not what it was just a short while ago. A man forced to die with his face pressed to the ground may yet shift the earth under your feet.\n\nThose at the head of the march had other ideas.

It's desperately difficult for any of us to predict the future and yet, thanks so often to the long, hard, and sometimes remarkably dangerous work of organizers and activists, even the most seemingly immutable things can change over time and under the right conditions. A Latter-Day Lynching Despite my comments to Tom, if you had told me that, in the span of a few months, a novel coronavirus that dates back only to last year and systemic American racism that dates back to 1619 would somehow intersect, I wouldn't have believed it. If you had told me that a man named George Floyd would survive Covid-19 only to be murdered by the police and that his brutal death would spark a worldwide movement, leading the council members of a major American city to announce their intent to defund the police and Europeans halfway across the planet to deface monuments to a murderous 19 century monarch who slaughtered Africans, I would have dismissed you. But history works in mysterious ways. Four hundred years of racism, systemic abuse of authority, unpunished police misconduct , white skin privilege, and a host of other evils at the dark core of America gave a white Minneapolis police officer the license to press a black man's face to the pavement and jam a knee into his neck for nearly nine minutes. For allegedly attempting to buy a pack of cigarettes with a phony $20 bill, George Floyd was killed at the intersection of 38th Street and Chicago Avenue in Minneapolis, Minn., by police officer Derek Chauvin. At the beginning of the last century, whites could murder a black man , woman, or child in this country as part of a public celebration, memorialize it on postcards , and mail them to friends. Between 1877 and 1950 , nearly 4,000 blacks were lynched in the American South, more than a death a week for 73 years. But the murders of blacks, whether at the hands of their owners in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries or of unaccountable fellow Americans in the latter 19th and 20th centuries never ended despite changes in some attitudes, significant federal legislation, and the notable successes of the protests, marches, and activism of the civil rights movement of the 1960s. From 2006 to 2012 , in fact, a white police officer killed a black person in America almost twice a week, according to FBI statistics. And less than a month before we watched the last moments of George Floyd's life, we witnessed a modern-day version of a lynching when Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old black man, was gunned down while jogging on a suburban street in Glynn County, Ga. Gregory McMichael, a 64-year-old white retired district attorney, investigator, and police detective, and his son Travis, 34, were eventually arrested and charged with his murder. Without the Covid-19 pandemic and the Trump administration's botched response to it, without black Americans' dying of the disease at three times the rate of whites, without the suddenly spotlighted health disparities that have always consigned people of color to die at elevated rates, without a confluence of so many horrors that the black community in America has suffered for so long coupled with those of a new virus, would we be in the place we're in today? If President Trump hadn't cheered on the efforts of mostly older white protesters to end pandemic shutdowns and \"liberate\" their states and then echoed a racist Miami police chief of the 1960s who promised \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts,\" essentially calling for young black protesters to be gunned down, would the present movement have taken off in such a way? And would these protests have been as powerful if people who had avoided outside contact for weeks hadn't suddenly decided to risk their own lives and those of others around them because this murder was too brazen, too likely to end in injustice for private handwringing and public hashtags? In Minneapolis, where George Floyd drew his last embattled breath, a veto-proof majority of the city council recently announced their commitment to disbanding the city's police department. As council president Lisa Bender put it: \"We're here because we hear you. We are here today because George Floyd was killed by the Minneapolis police. We are here because here in Minneapolis and in cities across the United States it is clear that our existing system of policing and public safety is not keeping our communities safe. Our efforts at incremental reform have failed. Period.\" A month ago, such a statement by almost any council chief in any American city-much less similar sentiments voiced across the nation-would have been essentially unthinkable. Only small numbers of activists working away with tiny chisels on a mountain of official intransigence could even have imagined such a thing and they would have been dismissed by the punditocracy as delusional. But the reverberations of George Floyd's death have hardly been confined to the city where he was slain or even the country whose systemic bigotry put a target on his back for 46 years. His death and America's rampant racism have led to soul-searching across the globe, sparking protests against discrimination and police brutality from Australia to Germany, Argentina to Kenya . In Ghent, Belgium, a bust honoring King Leopold II was defaced and covered with a hood bearing Floyd's dying plea: \"I can't breathe.\" In Antwerp, Leopold's statue was set on fire and later removed. It was Leopold, as TomDispatch regular Adam Hochschild so memorably documented in King Leopold's Ghost , who, in the late 19th century, seized the vast territory surrounding Africa's Congo River, looted its rubber, brutalized its people, and presided over a fin de siècle holocaust that took the lives of as many as 10 million people, roughly half the Congo's population. Belgian activists are now calling for all the country's statues and monuments to the murderous monarch to be torn down. A Cultural Renaissance or a Societal Black Death? Like the island off its coast , Hoboken was born of a great swindle. In 1658, the Dutch governor of Manhattan reportedly bought the tract of land that now includes that mile-square New Jersey city from the Lenape people for some wampum, cloth, kettles, blankets, six guns and-fittingly enough, given Hoboken's startling bars-to-area ratio- half a barrel of beer . In other words, the city where I covered that demonstration is part and parcel of the settler colonialism, slavery, and racism that forms the bedrock of this nation. But even in that white enclave, that bastion of 21st century gentrification, in the midst of a lethal global pandemic with no cure, 10,000 people flooded its parks and streets, carrying signs like \"Racism is a pandemic, too\" and \"Covid is not the only killer\" that would have made little sense six months ago. There were also posters that would have been shocking in Hoboken only several weeks ago, but didn't cause anyone to bat an eye, like \"ACAB\" (an acronym for \"All Cops are Bastards\") or Are you a: [ ] Killer cop [ ] Complicit Cop Not to mention dozens and dozens of signs reading \"Defund the Police\" or \"Abolish the Police.\" Suddenly- to most of us, at least -such proposals were on the table. In reality, social change rarely occurs by accident or chance. It usually comes in the wake of years of relentless, thankless, grinding activism. It also takes a willingness to head for the barricades when history has illuminated the dangers of doing so. It requires persistence in the face of weariness and distraction, and courage in the face of abject adversity. Where this movement goes, how it changes this nation, and what it spawns around the world will be won or lost on the streets of our tomorrows. Will it mean an America that inches closer to long-articulated but never remotely approached ideals, or usher in a backlash that leads to a wave of politicians in the Trumpian mold? In moments like this, there's no way of knowing whether you're on the cusp of a cultural renaissance or a societal Black Death. It takes a long time, but Earth's orbit and axis do change, and once they do, things are never the same again. Already, from Minneapolis to Antwerp to modest Hoboken, this world is not what it was just a short while ago. A man forced to die with his face pressed to the ground may yet shift the earth under your feet.\n\n\"Whose streets? Our streets!\" is a well-worn activist chant, but for a little while it was true as Hoboken's motorcycle cops played catch-up and the march turned this way and that-first, uptown on Washington, where a conspicuous minority of businesses were boarded up, expecting trouble that never came. Then, a left onto Sixth, another onto Jackson. Monroe. Park. Finally, back to Washington and onward. All the while, the voices of the mostly white marchers, being led in call-and-response chants mainly by people of color, rang through the streets and echoed off high-rent low-rises. \"Hands up! Don't shoot!\" \"No justice! No peace!\" \"Say his name!

If you had told me that a man named George Floyd would survive Covid-19 only to be murdered by the police and that his brutal death would spark a worldwide movement, leading the council members of a major American city to announce their intent to defund the police and Europeans halfway across the planet to deface monuments to a murderous 19 century monarch who slaughtered Africans, I would have dismissed you. But history works in mysterious ways. Four hundred years of racism, systemic abuse of authority, unpunished police misconduct , white skin privilege, and a host of other evils at the dark core of America gave a white Minneapolis police officer the license to press a black man's face to the pavement and jam a knee into his neck for nearly nine minutes. For allegedly attempting to buy a pack of cigarettes with a phony $20 bill, George Floyd was killed at the intersection of 38th Street and Chicago Avenue in Minneapolis, Minn., by police officer Derek Chauvin. At the beginning of the last century, whites could murder a black man , woman, or child in this country as part of a public celebration, memorialize it on postcards , and mail them to friends. Between 1877 and 1950 , nearly 4,000 blacks were lynched in the American South, more than a death a week for 73 years. But the murders of blacks, whether at the hands of their owners in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries or of unaccountable fellow Americans in the latter 19th and 20th centuries never ended despite changes in some attitudes, significant federal legislation, and the notable successes of the protests, marches, and activism of the civil rights movement of the 1960s. From 2006 to 2012 , in fact, a white police officer killed a black person in America almost twice a week, according to FBI statistics. And less than a month before we watched the last moments of George Floyd's life, we witnessed a modern-day version of a lynching when Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old black man, was gunned down while jogging on a suburban street in Glynn County, Ga. Gregory McMichael, a 64-year-old white retired district attorney, investigator, and police detective, and his son Travis, 34, were eventually arrested and charged with his murder. Without the Covid-19 pandemic and the Trump administration's botched response to it, without black Americans' dying of the disease at three times the rate of whites, without the suddenly spotlighted health disparities that have always consigned people of color to die at elevated rates, without a confluence of so many horrors that the black community in America has suffered for so long coupled with those of a new virus, would we be in the place we're in today? If President Trump hadn't cheered on the efforts of mostly older white protesters to end pandemic shutdowns and \"liberate\" their states and then echoed a racist Miami police chief of the 1960s who promised \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts,\" essentially calling for young black protesters to be gunned down, would the present movement have taken off in such a way? And would these protests have been as powerful if people who had avoided outside contact for weeks hadn't suddenly decided to risk their own lives and those of others around them because this murder was too brazen, too likely to end in injustice for private handwringing and public hashtags? In Minneapolis, where George Floyd drew his last embattled breath, a veto-proof majority of the city council recently announced their commitment to disbanding the city's police department. As council president Lisa Bender put it: \"We're here because we hear you. We are here today because George Floyd was killed by the Minneapolis police. We are here because here in Minneapolis and in cities across the United States it is clear that our existing system of policing and public safety is not keeping our communities safe. Our efforts at incremental reform have failed. Period.\" A month ago, such a statement by almost any council chief in any American city-much less similar sentiments voiced across the nation-would have been essentially unthinkable. Only small numbers of activists working away with tiny chisels on a mountain of official intransigence could even have imagined such a thing and they would have been dismissed by the punditocracy as delusional. But the reverberations of George Floyd's death have hardly been confined to the city where he was slain or even the country whose systemic bigotry put a target on his back for 46 years. His death and America's rampant racism have led to soul-searching across the globe, sparking protests against discrimination and police brutality from Australia to Germany, Argentina to Kenya . In Ghent, Belgium, a bust honoring King Leopold II was defaced and covered with a hood bearing Floyd's dying plea: \"I can't breathe.\" In Antwerp, Leopold's statue was set on fire and later removed. It was Leopold, as TomDispatch regular Adam Hochschild so memorably documented in King Leopold's Ghost , who, in the late 19th century, seized the vast territory surrounding Africa's Congo River, looted its rubber, brutalized its people, and presided over a fin de siècle holocaust that took the lives of as many as 10 million people, roughly half the Congo's population. Belgian activists are now calling for all the country's statues and monuments to the murderous monarch to be torn down. A Cultural Renaissance or a Societal Black Death? Like the island off its coast , Hoboken was born of a great swindle. In 1658, the Dutch governor of Manhattan reportedly bought the tract of land that now includes that mile-square New Jersey city from the Lenape people for some wampum, cloth, kettles, blankets, six guns and-fittingly enough, given Hoboken's startling bars-to-area ratio- half a barrel of beer . In other words, the city where I covered that demonstration is part and parcel of the settler colonialism, slavery, and racism that forms the bedrock of this nation. But even in that white enclave, that bastion of 21st century gentrification, in the midst of a lethal global pandemic with no cure, 10,000 people flooded its parks and streets, carrying signs like \"Racism is a pandemic, too\" and \"Covid is not the only killer\" that would have made little sense six months ago. There were also posters that would have been shocking in Hoboken only several weeks ago, but didn't cause anyone to bat an eye, like \"ACAB\" (an acronym for \"All Cops are Bastards\") or Are you a: [ ] Killer cop [ ] Complicit Cop Not to mention dozens and dozens of signs reading \"Defund the Police\" or \"Abolish the Police.\" Suddenly- to most of us, at least -such proposals were on the table. In reality, social change rarely occurs by accident or chance. It usually comes in the wake of years of relentless, thankless, grinding activism. It also takes a willingness to head for the barricades when history has illuminated the dangers of doing so. It requires persistence in the face of weariness and distraction, and courage in the face of abject adversity. Where this movement goes, how it changes this nation, and what it spawns around the world will be won or lost on the streets of our tomorrows. Will it mean an America that inches closer to long-articulated but never remotely approached ideals, or usher in a backlash that leads to a wave of politicians in the Trumpian mold? In moments like this, there's no way of knowing whether you're on the cusp of a cultural renaissance or a societal Black Death. It takes a long time, but Earth's orbit and axis do change, and once they do, things are never the same again. Already, from Minneapolis to Antwerp to modest Hoboken, this world is not what it was just a short while ago. A man forced to die with his face pressed to the ground may yet shift the earth under your feet.\n\n\"No justice! No peace!\" \"Say his name! George Floyd!\" Current Issue View our current issue As an ever-more middle-aged white guy who, a decade ago, traded covering US protests for reporting from African war zones , I have little of substance to add to the superlative coverage of the Black Lives Matter demonstrations that have erupted across the country in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd.

We are here because here in Minneapolis and in cities across the United States it is clear that our existing system of policing and public safety is not keeping our communities safe. Our efforts at incremental reform have failed. Period.\" A month ago, such a statement by almost any council chief in any American city-much less similar sentiments voiced across the nation-would have been essentially unthinkable. Only small numbers of activists working away with tiny chisels on a mountain of official intransigence could even have imagined such a thing and they would have been dismissed by the punditocracy as delusional. But the reverberations of George Floyd's death have hardly been confined to the city where he was slain or even the country whose systemic bigotry put a target on his back for 46 years. His death and America's rampant racism have led to soul-searching across the globe, sparking protests against discrimination and police brutality from Australia to Germany, Argentina to Kenya . In Ghent, Belgium, a bust honoring King Leopold II was defaced and covered with a hood bearing Floyd's dying plea: \"I can't breathe.\" In Antwerp, Leopold's statue was set on fire and later removed. It was Leopold, as TomDispatch regular Adam Hochschild so memorably documented in King Leopold's Ghost , who, in the late 19th century, seized the vast territory surrounding Africa's Congo River, looted its rubber, brutalized its people, and presided over a fin de siècle holocaust that took the lives of as many as 10 million people, roughly half the Congo's population. Belgian activists are now calling for all the country's statues and monuments to the murderous monarch to be torn down. A Cultural Renaissance or a Societal Black Death? Like the island off its coast , Hoboken was born of a great swindle. In 1658, the Dutch governor of Manhattan reportedly bought the tract of land that now includes that mile-square New Jersey city from the Lenape people for some wampum, cloth, kettles, blankets, six guns and-fittingly enough, given Hoboken's startling bars-to-area ratio- half a barrel of beer . In other words, the city where I covered that demonstration is part and parcel of the settler colonialism, slavery, and racism that forms the bedrock of this nation. But even in that white enclave, that bastion of 21st century gentrification, in the midst of a lethal global pandemic with no cure, 10,000 people flooded its parks and streets, carrying signs like \"Racism is a pandemic, too\" and \"Covid is not the only killer\" that would have made little sense six months ago. There were also posters that would have been shocking in Hoboken only several weeks ago, but didn't cause anyone to bat an eye, like \"ACAB\" (an acronym for \"All Cops are Bastards\") or Are you a: [ ] Killer cop [ ] Complicit Cop Not to mention dozens and dozens of signs reading \"Defund the Police\" or \"Abolish the Police.\" Suddenly- to most of us, at least -such proposals were on the table. In reality, social change rarely occurs by accident or chance. It usually comes in the wake of years of relentless, thankless, grinding activism. It also takes a willingness to head for the barricades when history has illuminated the dangers of doing so. It requires persistence in the face of weariness and distraction, and courage in the face of abject adversity. Where this movement goes, how it changes this nation, and what it spawns around the world will be won or lost on the streets of our tomorrows. Will it mean an America that inches closer to long-articulated but never remotely approached ideals, or usher in a backlash that leads to a wave of politicians in the Trumpian mold? In moments like this, there's no way of knowing whether you're on the cusp of a cultural renaissance or a societal Black Death. It takes a long time, but Earth's orbit and axis do change, and once they do, things are never the same again. Already, from Minneapolis to Antwerp to modest Hoboken, this world is not what it was just a short while ago. A man forced to die with his face pressed to the ground may yet shift the earth under your feet.\n\nInstead, bear with me while I ruminate about something I said to Tom Engelhardt, the editor of this website, TomDispatch , at the beginning of March when our lives changed forever. Instead of simply bemoaning the onslaught of the Covid-19 pandemic-however devastating and deadly it might prove to be-I uncharacteristically looked on the bright side, suggesting that this could be one of those rare transformative moments that shifts the world's axis and leads to revolutionary change.

It's desperately difficult for any of us to predict the future and yet, thanks so often to the long, hard, and sometimes remarkably dangerous work of organizers and activists, even the most seemingly immutable things can change over time and under the right conditions. A Latter-Day Lynching Despite my comments to Tom, if you had told me that, in the span of a few months, a novel coronavirus that dates back only to last year and systemic American racism that dates back to 1619 would somehow intersect, I wouldn't have believed it. If you had told me that a man named George Floyd would survive Covid-19 only to be murdered by the police and that his brutal death would spark a worldwide movement, leading the council members of a major American city to announce their intent to defund the police and Europeans halfway across the planet to deface monuments to a murderous 19 century monarch who slaughtered Africans, I would have dismissed you. But history works in mysterious ways. Four hundred years of racism, systemic abuse of authority, unpunished police misconduct , white skin privilege, and a host of other evils at the dark core of America gave a white Minneapolis police officer the license to press a black man's face to the pavement and jam a knee into his neck for nearly nine minutes. For allegedly attempting to buy a pack of cigarettes with a phony $20 bill, George Floyd was killed at the intersection of 38th Street and Chicago Avenue in Minneapolis, Minn., by police officer Derek Chauvin. At the beginning of the last century, whites could murder a black man , woman, or child in this country as part of a public celebration, memorialize it on postcards , and mail them to friends. Between 1877 and 1950 , nearly 4,000 blacks were lynched in the American South, more than a death a week for 73 years. But the murders of blacks, whether at the hands of their owners in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries or of unaccountable fellow Americans in the latter 19th and 20th centuries never ended despite changes in some attitudes, significant federal legislation, and the notable successes of the protests, marches, and activism of the civil rights movement of the 1960s. From 2006 to 2012 , in fact, a white police officer killed a black person in America almost twice a week, according to FBI statistics. And less than a month before we watched the last moments of George Floyd's life, we witnessed a modern-day version of a lynching when Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old black man, was gunned down while jogging on a suburban street in Glynn County, Ga. Gregory McMichael, a 64-year-old white retired district attorney, investigator, and police detective, and his son Travis, 34, were eventually arrested and charged with his murder. Without the Covid-19 pandemic and the Trump administration's botched response to it, without black Americans' dying of the disease at three times the rate of whites, without the suddenly spotlighted health disparities that have always consigned people of color to die at elevated rates, without a confluence of so many horrors that the black community in America has suffered for so long coupled with those of a new virus, would we be in the place we're in today? If President Trump hadn't cheered on the efforts of mostly older white protesters to end pandemic shutdowns and \"liberate\" their states and then echoed a racist Miami police chief of the 1960s who promised \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts,\" essentially calling for young black protesters to be gunned down, would the present movement have taken off in such a way? And would these protests have been as powerful if people who had avoided outside contact for weeks hadn't suddenly decided to risk their own lives and those of others around them because this murder was too brazen, too likely to end in injustice for private handwringing and public hashtags?

In moments like this, there's no way of knowing whether you're on the cusp of a cultural renaissance or a societal Black Death.

Already, from Minneapolis to Antwerp to modest Hoboken, this world is not what it was just a short while ago. A man forced to die with his face pressed to the ground may yet shift the earth under your feet.\n\nAt the beginning of the last century, whites could murder a black man , woman, or child in this country as part of a public celebration, memorialize it on postcards , and mail them to friends. Between 1877 and 1950 , nearly 4,000 blacks were lynched in the American South, more than a death a week for 73 years. But the murders of blacks, whether at the hands of their owners in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries or of unaccountable fellow Americans in the latter 19th and 20th centuries never ended despite changes in some attitudes, significant federal legislation, and the notable successes of the protests, marches, and activism of the civil rights movement of the 1960s. From 2006 to 2012 , in fact, a white police officer killed a black person in America almost twice a week, according to FBI statistics. And less than a month before we watched the last moments of George Floyd's life, we witnessed a modern-day version of a lynching when Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old black man, was gunned down while jogging on a suburban street in Glynn County, Ga. Gregory McMichael, a 64-year-old white retired district attorney, investigator, and police detective, and his son Travis, 34, were eventually arrested and charged with his murder. Without the Covid-19 pandemic and the Trump administration's botched response to it, without black Americans' dying of the disease at three times the rate of whites, without the suddenly spotlighted health disparities that have always consigned people of color to die at elevated rates, without a confluence of so many horrors that the black community in America has suffered for so long coupled with those of a new virus, would we be in the place we're in today? If President Trump hadn't cheered on the efforts of mostly older white protesters to end pandemic shutdowns and \"liberate\" their states and then echoed a racist Miami police chief of the 1960s who promised \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts,\" essentially calling for young black protesters to be gunned down, would the present movement have taken off in such a way? And would these protests have been as powerful if people who had avoided outside contact for weeks hadn't suddenly decided to risk their own lives and those of others around them because this murder was too brazen, too likely to end in injustice for private handwringing and public hashtags? In Minneapolis, where George Floyd drew his last embattled breath, a veto-proof majority of the city council recently announced their commitment to disbanding the city's police department. As council president Lisa Bender put it: \"We're here because we hear you. We are here today because George Floyd was killed by the Minneapolis police. We are here because here in Minneapolis and in cities across the United States it is clear that our existing system of policing and public safety is not keeping our communities safe. Our efforts at incremental reform have failed. Period.\" A month ago, such a statement by almost any council chief in any American city-much less similar sentiments voiced across the nation-would have been essentially unthinkable. Only small numbers of activists working away with tiny chisels on a mountain of official intransigence could even have imagined such a thing and they would have been dismissed by the punditocracy as delusional. But the reverberations of George Floyd's death have hardly been confined to the city where he was slain or even the country whose systemic bigotry put a target on his back for 46 years. His death and America's rampant racism have led to soul-searching across the globe, sparking protests against discrimination and police brutality from Australia to Germany, Argentina to Kenya . In Ghent, Belgium, a bust honoring King Leopold II was defaced and covered with a hood bearing Floyd's dying plea: \"I can't breathe.\" In Antwerp, Leopold's statue was set on fire and later removed. It was Leopold, as TomDispatch regular Adam Hochschild so memorably documented in King Leopold's Ghost , who, in the late 19th century, seized the vast territory surrounding Africa's Congo River, looted its rubber, brutalized its people, and presided over a fin de siècle holocaust that took the lives of as many as 10 million people, roughly half the Congo's population.

But while the movement coalesced around the street marches in Ferguson and then spread to places like Baltimore, Cleveland, and Chicago, the declaration that supplied its name was coined considerably earlier: in 2013, shortly after George Zimmerman was acquitted of murder in the death of Trayvon Martin. Books in Review \"They Can't Kill Us All\": Ferguson, Baltimore, and a New Era in America's Racial Justice Movement By Wesley Lowery Buy this book On the day of Zimmerman's acquittal, a Bay Area activist by the name of Alicia Garza took to Facebook. \"I continue to be surprised at how little Black lives matter,\" she wrote. \"And I will continue that. [S]top giving up on black life.\" The death of Michael Brown in Ferguson may have been the national tipping point, the moment when Americans were jolted awake by this new rallying cry. But it was Garza and her fellow activists, Opal Tometi and Patrisse Cullors, who helped popularize the phrase as a hashtag on Twitter and Tumblr one year earlier. Movements often have these kinds of indeterminate beginnings-several, at different moments in time, until they get everyone's attention-and today, in fact, there are so many iterations of Black Lives Matter that it is perhaps most accurate to describe the protests not as a movement but as a set of movements, each with different locally based groups, and without a clear leader or group of leaders. In his new book \"They Can't Kill Us All,\" Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowery sets out not only to track the latest developments in Black Lives Matter, but also to search for the movement's deeper roots. For Lowery, although BLM protests originated with the recent police killings in the United States-his book takes its title from a sign spotted in Ferguson-he also wants us to recognize that the politics animating these protests have long been around. Lowery traces the movement's origins to the hope of a \"post­racial\" America that was symbolized by Barack Obama's election, and which has now proved to be little more than a phantasm of campaign rhetoric and political punditry. Having once hoped that the election of the first black president meant that the tide of race relations in America might begin to turn, many young black Americans were forced to face the reality-by one high-profile police shooting after another-that living in a world in which they're treated like their white contemporaries remains an impossibility. The persistence of police violence against young black people, and the often-racist backlash that followed Obama's election, initiated this new generation into a cycle that has characterized America's fraught racial history: A period of optimism born out of a spectacular political moment-the Emancipation Proclamation; Reconstruction; the civil-rights movement of the 1960s-is then followed by a period of reaction and retrenchment. This narrative of youthful idealism followed by frustration and despair is the crux of Lowery's book, and he believes that the second half of this cycle is now in full swing. But while Black Lives Matter arose in a moment of disappointment and grief, it has for the past four years also helped to inaugurate a new era in the struggle for racial justice.

He mostly covered murders and street crime and also reported on the Boston Marathon bombings. But his ambition was to cover national politics, and when he moved to The Washington Post , he set his sights on the 2016 presidential race. Lowery's beat shifted, though, shortly after Brown's death and the protests that followed. The Post sent him to Ferguson; he got arrested even while brandishing a press pass, and soon found a new beat: police brutality and the protests that were emerging in its wake. \"Not since the Boston Marathon bombings a year and a half earlier had I covered a story for which there was such intense, immediate appetite,\" he writes, later adding: \"Police shootings aren't uncommon, and as a reporter who is professionally acquainted with hundreds of other reporters, images of an angry vigil of grieving residents weren't particularly out of place in my social media feeds. But even in those early posts, Mike Brown's death just felt different. The crowds gathered near this young man's body emanated a guttural anguish. It was clear even then, for those paying attention, that this communal anger would not be easily muted or contained.\" \"They Can't Kill Us All\" is the outcome of Lowery's past two years covering this anguish. He spends the first three-quarters of his book focused on several high-profile police killings: Brown in Ferguson; Tamir Rice in Cleveland; Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina; and Freddie Gray in Baltimore. But while his book is ostensibly about these deaths and the local protests that they inspired, Lowery also has larger ambitions, ranging widely across race relations and racial violence in the United States, including the slaying of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, by a young white man; the removal of the Confederate flag at the South Carolina statehouse by an African- American woman named Bree Newsome; and the emergence of a national movement, or set of movements, responding to the call to arms of Black Lives Matter. Lowery insists that the story of Black Lives Matter's roots and intentions is often misunderstood at best and, at worst, purposefully muddied in order to discredit the movement and its leaders. Conservative talking heads have likened BLM and the young black people protesting police brutality to the Ku Klux Klan, arguing that the protesters are perpetuating violence against the police and, more broadly, against white people. Liberal pundits have also been guilty of misrepresenting the movement, seeking to link it to the Democrats-even though many of its leaders have made it clear that BLM isn't tied to any political party. Lowery's book therefore tries to offer a corrective: Movements often have many different origin stories, and his careful behind-the-scenes reporting offers insight into how the various grassroots campaigns converged into what is now often referred to as a single protest movement. He also wants us to discard whatever preconceived notions we have about Black Lives Matter and learn about the nuances and complexities involved in the making of a movement. What happened in Ferguson, Cleveland, and other cities wasn't anything new; it was just slowly being unveiled to the rest of the public. For centuries, black people in America have struggled for equality, and Black Lives Matter is yet another extension of that struggle. In fact, as BLM has emerged as a national movement, it has become linked with many other issues related to racial justice, from voting rights and mass incarceration to economic inequality and barriers to health care and education-all issues that concern the broader American left. Many mainstream-media outlets have missed this larger context. Instead of trying to understand how the protests in St. Louis or Baltimore are linked to a much longer history of political struggle, journalists often descend on these cities to get a sensational photo or to break breathless news reports about the confrontations between police and protesters. Rather than looking at the long-standing patterns of police harassment or examining the ways in which these municipalities rely on the frequent ticketing of their black citizens for funds, many newspapers have run stories that indict the victims of police violence, not the officers who killed them or the larger system in which they operate. \"And by focusing on the character of the victim,\" Lowery writes, \"we inadvertently take the focus off the powerful and instead train our eyes and judgment on the powerless.\" Lowery also takes the media to task for overstating the importance of their role in social movements. It's true that without journalists covering the civil-rights movement, many Americans might not have been persuaded of the justness of its cause. But Lowery believes that reporters often exaggerate their influence on the shaping of social movements. One can hear a bit of self-criticism here as well. After all, Lowery is himself a journalist who hopes that his reporting may help provide a fairer and more accurate account of Black Lives Matter. In this way, these critical asides come not from a frustrated outsider, but from a respected mainstream journalist attempting to change the way his colleagues report on the movement as a whole. T he book tells a bleak story, but Lowery concludes on a relatively optimistic note. Although the nation's future looks uncertain and there is much work left to do, in the end, he insists, both the rallying cry and the activism of Black Lives Matter will endure. (Of course, Lowery wrote his book before the election of Donald Trump, so he can be forgiven for not adopting a more ominous tone.) And by certain measures, the movement has been a notable success: BLM protests have been able to put and keep the issue of police brutality at the forefront of the national conversation; the movement has forced politicians to begin to speak the language of Black Lives Matter; and because of public pressure in the wake of Ferguson and Baltimore, a small number of police officers have been charged with shooting unarmed citizens. But the police killings of unarmed black Americans continue. Each new shooting has seemed like a turning point to activists, an incident far too egregious to be ignored. But almost all of the high-profile police killings have led neither to prison sentences nor reforms. In South Carolina, Michael Slager, the white cop who shot an unarmed and fleeing Walter Scott in the back, was tried for murder, but the jurors couldn't reach a verdict and the judge was forced to declare a mistrial, allowing Slager to be released pending a new trial. A few months after Scott was killed, University of Cincinnati Police Officer Ray Tensing fatally shot Sam DuBose after pulling him over for a missing license plate-but, as in the case of Scott's killing, the jury deadlocked and a mistrial was declared. More cases in which justice will be delayed or denied are certainly on the horizon; for each gain in police reform, there will be another glaring example of why more is needed. The cycle between hope and despair today seems to be in overdrive; each morning we awake to a country that is simultaneously more disheartening and more hopeful than the day before. The election of a president who ran a xenophobic, race-baiting, and ethno-nationalist campaign will mean even greater accelerations, as new protest movements emerge, only to find the space for social change dramatically shrinking. In this way, the new era for America's racial-justice movement seems not unlike previous ones. In the 1960s, while black Americans often protested injustice and police brutality with rallies and marches, white Americans terrorized these mostly peaceful protests with threats and acts of vigilante violence that went ignored by the local authorities. Likewise, while politicians like John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson helped usher in sweeping civil-rights reforms, they were followed by the likes of Richard Nixon, Barry Goldwater, and George Wallace, who responded to these reforms with the dog-whistle demonization of black people and anyone who stood with them. Plenty of Americans let their disdain for the civil-rights activists be known then-often with the same kind of rhetoric and images used against Black Lives Matter. B ecause he's a reporter first, Lowery writes much of \"They Can't Kill Us All\" in the evenhanded and straightforward register that one expects of contemporary reporting. But hints of emotion nonetheless break through. At one point, Lowery confesses that he was close to crying when he was assigned to fly out to North Charleston after Scott's death. \"I didn't want to get on this plane,\" he writes, \"I didn't want to spend days telling yet another story of a black man gunned down.\" But despite his growing sense of dread as he continues to report on the police shootings, Lowery's book is written mostly from a position of hope. While many of his peers have advanced a grimmer view when discussing the cycles of African-American history, Lowery finds a cause for optimism in our era's developing racial-justice movement. After the grand jury in Ferguson chose not to indict Officer Darren Wilson, many warned of rioting; instead, protesters took to the streets in droves to denounce this miscarriage of justice. As we settle into the next four years of Trump's presidency, it's hard to embrace fully Lowery's sense of hope and possibility. But the quiet optimism underlying his book is itself an act of protest in our dark times. As the Ferguson protesters, quoting Kendrick Lamar, insisted to Lowery: \"We gon' be alright.\"\n\nBy Wesley Lowery\n\nBuy this book\n\nOn the day of Zimmerman's acquittal, a Bay Area activist by the name of Alicia Garza took to Facebook. \"I continue to be surprised at how little Black lives matter,\" she wrote. \"And I will continue that. [S]top giving up on black life.\" The death of Michael Brown in Ferguson may have been the national tipping point, the moment when Americans were jolted awake by this new rallying cry. But it was Garza and her fellow activists, Opal Tometi and Patrisse Cullors, who helped popularize the phrase as a hashtag on Twitter and Tumblr one year earlier. Movements often have these kinds of indeterminate beginnings-several, at different moments in time, until they get everyone's attention-and today, in fact, there are so many iterations of Black Lives Matter that it is perhaps most accurate to describe the protests not as a movement but as a set of movements, each with different locally based groups, and without a clear leader or group of leaders. In his new book \"They Can't Kill Us All,\" Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowery sets out not only to track the latest developments in Black Lives Matter, but also to search for the movement's deeper roots. For Lowery, although BLM protests originated with the recent police killings in the United States-his book takes its title from a sign spotted in Ferguson-he also wants us to recognize that the politics animating these protests have long been around. Lowery traces the movement's origins to the hope of a \"post­racial\" America that was symbolized by Barack Obama's election, and which has now proved to be little more than a phantasm of campaign rhetoric and political punditry. Having once hoped that the election of the first black president meant that the tide of race relations in America might begin to turn, many young black Americans were forced to face the reality-by one high-profile police shooting after another-that living in a world in which they're treated like their white contemporaries remains an impossibility. The persistence of police violence against young black people, and the often-racist backlash that followed Obama's election, initiated this new generation into a cycle that has characterized America's fraught racial history: A period of optimism born out of a spectacular political moment-the Emancipation Proclamation; Reconstruction; the civil-rights movement of the 1960s-is then followed by a period of reaction and retrenchment. This narrative of youthful idealism followed by frustration and despair is the crux of Lowery's book, and he believes that the second half of this cycle is now in full swing. But while Black Lives Matter arose in a moment of disappointment and grief, it has for the past four years also helped to inaugurate a new era in the struggle for racial justice.

He mostly covered murders and street crime and also reported on the Boston Marathon bombings. But his ambition was to cover national politics, and when he moved to The Washington Post , he set his sights on the 2016 presidential race. Lowery's beat shifted, though, shortly after Brown's death and the protests that followed. The Post sent him to Ferguson; he got arrested even while brandishing a press pass, and soon found a new beat: police brutality and the protests that were emerging in its wake. \"Not since the Boston Marathon bombings a year and a half earlier had I covered a story for which there was such intense, immediate appetite,\" he writes, later adding: \"Police shootings aren't uncommon, and as a reporter who is professionally acquainted with hundreds of other reporters, images of an angry vigil of grieving residents weren't particularly out of place in my social media feeds. But even in those early posts, Mike Brown's death just felt different. The crowds gathered near this young man's body emanated a guttural anguish. It was clear even then, for those paying attention, that this communal anger would not be easily muted or contained.\" \"They Can't Kill Us All\" is the outcome of Lowery's past two years covering this anguish. He spends the first three-quarters of his book focused on several high-profile police killings: Brown in Ferguson; Tamir Rice in Cleveland; Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina; and Freddie Gray in Baltimore. But while his book is ostensibly about these deaths and the local protests that they inspired, Lowery also has larger ambitions, ranging widely across race relations and racial violence in the United States, including the slaying of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, by a young white man; the removal of the Confederate flag at the South Carolina statehouse by an African- American woman named Bree Newsome; and the emergence of a national movement, or set of movements, responding to the call to arms of Black Lives Matter. Lowery insists that the story of Black Lives Matter's roots and intentions is often misunderstood at best and, at worst, purposefully muddied in order to discredit the movement and its leaders. Conservative talking heads have likened BLM and the young black people protesting police brutality to the Ku Klux Klan, arguing that the protesters are perpetuating violence against the police and, more broadly, against white people. Liberal pundits have also been guilty of misrepresenting the movement, seeking to link it to the Democrats-even though many of its leaders have made it clear that BLM isn't tied to any political party. Lowery's book therefore tries to offer a corrective: Movements often have many different origin stories, and his careful behind-the-scenes reporting offers insight into how the various grassroots campaigns converged into what is now often referred to as a single protest movement. He also wants us to discard whatever preconceived notions we have about Black Lives Matter and learn about the nuances and complexities involved in the making of a movement. What happened in Ferguson, Cleveland, and other cities wasn't anything new; it was just slowly being unveiled to the rest of the public. For centuries, black people in America have struggled for equality, and Black Lives Matter is yet another extension of that struggle. In fact, as BLM has emerged as a national movement, it has become linked with many other issues related to racial justice, from voting rights and mass incarceration to economic inequality and barriers to health care and education-all issues that concern the broader American left. Many mainstream-media outlets have missed this larger context. Instead of trying to understand how the protests in St. Louis or Baltimore are linked to a much longer history of political struggle, journalists often descend on these cities to get a sensational photo or to break breathless news reports about the confrontations between police and protesters. Rather than looking at the long-standing patterns of police harassment or examining the ways in which these municipalities rely on the frequent ticketing of their black citizens for funds, many newspapers have run stories that indict the victims of police violence, not the officers who killed them or the larger system in which they operate. \"And by focusing on the character of the victim,\" Lowery writes, \"we inadvertently take the focus off the powerful and instead train our eyes and judgment on the powerless.\" Lowery also takes the media to task for overstating the importance of their role in social movements. It's true that without journalists covering the civil-rights movement, many Americans might not have been persuaded of the justness of its cause. But Lowery believes that reporters often exaggerate their influence on the shaping of social movements. One can hear a bit of self-criticism here as well. After all, Lowery is himself a journalist who hopes that his reporting may help provide a fairer and more accurate account of Black Lives Matter. In this way, these critical asides come not from a frustrated outsider, but from a respected mainstream journalist attempting to change the way his colleagues report on the movement as a whole. T he book tells a bleak story, but Lowery concludes on a relatively optimistic note. Although the nation's future looks uncertain and there is much work left to do, in the end, he insists, both the rallying cry and the activism of Black Lives Matter will endure. (Of course, Lowery wrote his book before the election of Donald Trump, so he can be forgiven for not adopting a more ominous tone.) And by certain measures, the movement has been a notable success: BLM protests have been able to put and keep the issue of police brutality at the forefront of the national conversation; the movement has forced politicians to begin to speak the language of Black Lives Matter; and because of public pressure in the wake of Ferguson and Baltimore, a small number of police officers have been charged with shooting unarmed citizens. But the police killings of unarmed black Americans continue. Each new shooting has seemed like a turning point to activists, an incident far too egregious to be ignored. But almost all of the high-profile police killings have led neither to prison sentences nor reforms. In South Carolina, Michael Slager, the white cop who shot an unarmed and fleeing Walter Scott in the back, was tried for murder, but the jurors couldn't reach a verdict and the judge was forced to declare a mistrial, allowing Slager to be released pending a new trial. A few months after Scott was killed, University of Cincinnati Police Officer Ray Tensing fatally shot Sam DuBose after pulling him over for a missing license plate-but, as in the case of Scott's killing, the jury deadlocked and a mistrial was declared. More cases in which justice will be delayed or denied are certainly on the horizon; for each gain in police reform, there will be another glaring example of why more is needed. The cycle between hope and despair today seems to be in overdrive; each morning we awake to a country that is simultaneously more disheartening and more hopeful than the day before. The election of a president who ran a xenophobic, race-baiting, and ethno-nationalist campaign will mean even greater accelerations, as new protest movements emerge, only to find the space for social change dramatically shrinking. In this way, the new era for America's racial-justice movement seems not unlike previous ones. In the 1960s, while black Americans often protested injustice and police brutality with rallies and marches, white Americans terrorized these mostly peaceful protests with threats and acts of vigilante violence that went ignored by the local authorities. Likewise, while politicians like John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson helped usher in sweeping civil-rights reforms, they were followed by the likes of Richard Nixon, Barry Goldwater, and George Wallace, who responded to these reforms with the dog-whistle demonization of black people and anyone who stood with them. Plenty of Americans let their disdain for the civil-rights activists be known then-often with the same kind of rhetoric and images used against Black Lives Matter. B ecause he's a reporter first, Lowery writes much of \"They Can't Kill Us All\" in the evenhanded and straightforward register that one expects of contemporary reporting. But hints of emotion nonetheless break through. At one point, Lowery confesses that he was close to crying when he was assigned to fly out to North Charleston after Scott's death. \"I didn't want to get on this plane,\" he writes, \"I didn't want to spend days telling yet another story of a black man gunned down.\" But despite his growing sense of dread as he continues to report on the police shootings, Lowery's book is written mostly from a position of hope. While many of his peers have advanced a grimmer view when discussing the cycles of African-American history, Lowery finds a cause for optimism in our era's developing racial-justice movement. After the grand jury in Ferguson chose not to indict Officer Darren Wilson, many warned of rioting; instead, protesters took to the streets in droves to denounce this miscarriage of justice. As we settle into the next four years of Trump's presidency, it's hard to embrace fully Lowery's sense of hope and possibility.

But his ambition was to cover national politics, and when he moved to The Washington Post , he set his sights on the 2016 presidential race. Lowery's beat shifted, though, shortly after Brown's death and the protests that followed. The Post sent him to Ferguson; he got arrested even while brandishing a press pass, and soon found a new beat: police brutality and the protests that were emerging in its wake. \"Not since the Boston Marathon bombings a year and a half earlier had I covered a story for which there was such intense, immediate appetite,\" he writes, later adding: \"Police shootings aren't uncommon, and as a reporter who is professionally acquainted with hundreds of other reporters, images of an angry vigil of grieving residents weren't particularly out of place in my social media feeds. But even in those early posts, Mike Brown's death just felt different. The crowds gathered near this young man's body emanated a guttural anguish. It was clear even then, for those paying attention, that this communal anger would not be easily muted or contained.\" \"They Can't Kill Us All\" is the outcome of Lowery's past two years covering this anguish. He spends the first three-quarters of his book focused on several high-profile police killings: Brown in Ferguson; Tamir Rice in Cleveland; Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina; and Freddie Gray in Baltimore. But while his book is ostensibly about these deaths and the local protests that they inspired, Lowery also has larger ambitions, ranging widely across race relations and racial violence in the United States, including the slaying of nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, by a young white man; the removal of the Confederate flag at the South Carolina statehouse by an African- American woman named Bree Newsome; and the emergence of a national movement, or set of movements, responding to the call to arms of Black Lives Matter. Lowery insists that the story of Black Lives Matter's roots and intentions is often misunderstood at best and, at worst, purposefully muddied in order to discredit the movement and its leaders. Conservative talking heads have likened BLM and the young black people protesting police brutality to the Ku Klux Klan, arguing that the protesters are perpetuating violence against the police and, more broadly, against white people. Liberal pundits have also been guilty of misrepresenting the movement, seeking to link it to the Democrats-even though many of its leaders have made it clear that BLM isn't tied to any political party. Lowery's book therefore tries to offer a corrective: Movements often have many different origin stories, and his careful behind-the-scenes reporting offers insight into how the various grassroots campaigns converged into what is now often referred to as a single protest movement. He also wants us to discard whatever preconceived notions we have about Black Lives Matter and learn about the nuances and complexities involved in the making of a movement. What happened in Ferguson, Cleveland, and other cities wasn't anything new; it was just slowly being unveiled to the rest of the public. For centuries, black people in America have struggled for equality, and Black Lives Matter is yet another extension of that struggle. In fact, as BLM has emerged as a national movement, it has become linked with many other issues related to racial justice, from voting rights and mass incarceration to economic inequality and barriers to health care and education-all issues that concern the broader American left. Many mainstream-media outlets have missed this larger context. Instead of trying to understand how the protests in St. Louis or Baltimore are linked to a much longer history of political struggle, journalists often descend on these cities to get a sensational photo or to break breathless news reports about the confrontations between police and protesters. Rather than looking at the long-standing patterns of police harassment or examining the ways in which these municipalities rely on the frequent ticketing of their black citizens for funds, many newspapers have run stories that indict the victims of police violence, not the officers who killed them or the larger system in which they operate. \"And by focusing on the character of the victim,\" Lowery writes, \"we inadvertently take the focus off the powerful and instead train our eyes and judgment on the powerless.\" Lowery also takes the media to task for overstating the importance of their role in social movements. It's true that without journalists covering the civil-rights movement, many Americans might not have been persuaded of the justness of its cause. But Lowery believes that reporters often exaggerate their influence on the shaping of social movements. One can hear a bit of self-criticism here as well. After all, Lowery is himself a journalist who hopes that his reporting may help provide a fairer and more accurate account of Black Lives Matter. In this way, these critical asides come not from a frustrated outsider, but from a respected mainstream journalist attempting to change the way his colleagues report on the movement as a whole. T he book tells a bleak story, but Lowery concludes on a relatively optimistic note. Although the nation's future looks uncertain and there is much work left to do, in the end, he insists, both the rallying cry and the activism of Black Lives Matter will endure. (Of course, Lowery wrote his book before the election of Donald Trump, so he can be forgiven for not adopting a more ominous tone.) And by certain measures, the movement has been a notable success: BLM protests have been able to put and keep the issue of police brutality at the forefront of the national conversation; the movement has forced politicians to begin to speak the language of Black Lives Matter; and because of public pressure in the wake of Ferguson and Baltimore, a small number of police officers have been charged with shooting unarmed citizens. But the police killings of unarmed black Americans continue. Each new shooting has seemed like a turning point to activists, an incident far too egregious to be ignored. But almost all of the high-profile police killings have led neither to prison sentences nor reforms. In South Carolina, Michael Slager, the white cop who shot an unarmed and fleeing Walter Scott in the back, was tried for murder, but the jurors couldn't reach a verdict and the judge was forced to declare a mistrial, allowing Slager to be released pending a new trial. A few months after Scott was killed, University of Cincinnati Police Officer Ray Tensing fatally shot Sam DuBose after pulling him over for a missing license plate-but, as in the case of Scott's killing, the jury deadlocked and a mistrial was declared. More cases in which justice will be delayed or denied are certainly on the horizon; for each gain in police reform, there will be another glaring example of why more is needed. The cycle between hope and despair today seems to be in overdrive; each morning we awake to a country that is simultaneously more disheartening and more hopeful than the day before. The election of a president who ran a xenophobic, race-baiting, and ethno-nationalist campaign will mean even greater accelerations, as new protest movements emerge, only to find the space for social change dramatically shrinking. In this way, the new era for America's racial-justice movement seems not unlike previous ones. In the 1960s, while black Americans often protested injustice and police brutality with rallies and marches, white Americans terrorized these mostly peaceful protests with threats and acts of vigilante violence that went ignored by the local authorities. Likewise, while politicians like John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson helped usher in sweeping civil-rights reforms, they were followed by the likes of Richard Nixon, Barry Goldwater, and George Wallace, who responded to these reforms with the dog-whistle demonization of black people and anyone who stood with them. Plenty of Americans let their disdain for the civil-rights activists be known then-often with the same kind of rhetoric and images used against Black Lives Matter. B ecause he's a reporter first, Lowery writes much of \"They Can't Kill Us All\" in the evenhanded and straightforward register that one expects of contemporary reporting. But hints of emotion nonetheless break through. At one point, Lowery confesses that he was close to crying when he was assigned to fly out to North Charleston after Scott's death. \"I didn't want to get on this plane,\" he writes, \"I didn't want to spend days telling yet another story of a black man gunned down.\" But despite his growing sense of dread as he continues to report on the police shootings, Lowery's book is written mostly from a position of hope. While many of his peers have advanced a grimmer view when discussing the cycles of African-American history, Lowery finds a cause for optimism in our era's developing racial-justice movement. After the grand jury in Ferguson chose not to indict Officer Darren Wilson, many warned of rioting; instead, protesters took to the streets in droves to denounce this miscarriage of justice. As we settle into the next four years of Trump's presidency, it's hard to embrace fully Lowery's sense of hope and possibility. But the quiet optimism underlying his book is itself an act of protest in our dark times.

In South Carolina, Michael Slager, the white cop who shot an unarmed and fleeing Walter Scott in the back, was tried for murder, but the jurors couldn't reach a verdict and the judge was forced to declare a mistrial, allowing Slager to be released pending a new trial. A few months after Scott was killed, University of Cincinnati Police Officer Ray Tensing fatally shot Sam DuBose after pulling him over for a missing license plate-but, as in the case of Scott's killing, the jury deadlocked and a mistrial was declared. More cases in which justice will be delayed or denied are certainly on the horizon; for each gain in police reform, there will be another glaring example of why more is needed. The cycle between hope and despair today seems to be in overdrive; each morning we awake to a country that is simultaneously more disheartening and more hopeful than the day before. The election of a president who ran a xenophobic, race-baiting, and ethno-nationalist campaign will mean even greater accelerations, as new protest movements emerge, only to find the space for social change dramatically shrinking. In this way, the new era for America's racial-justice movement seems not unlike previous ones. In the 1960s, while black Americans often protested injustice and police brutality with rallies and marches, white Americans terrorized these mostly peaceful protests with threats and acts of vigilante violence that went ignored by the local authorities. Likewise, while politicians like John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson helped usher in sweeping civil-rights reforms, they were followed by the likes of Richard Nixon, Barry Goldwater, and George Wallace, who responded to these reforms with the dog-whistle demonization of black people and anyone who stood with them. Plenty of Americans let their disdain for the civil-rights activists be known then-often with the same kind of rhetoric and images used against Black Lives Matter. B ecause he's a reporter first, Lowery writes much of \"They Can't Kill Us All\" in the evenhanded and straightforward register that one expects of contemporary reporting. But hints of emotion nonetheless break through. At one point, Lowery confesses that he was close to crying when he was assigned to fly out to North Charleston after Scott's death. \"I didn't want to get on this plane,\" he writes, \"I didn't want to spend days telling yet another story of a black man gunned down.\" But despite his growing sense of dread as he continues to report on the police shootings, Lowery's book is written mostly from a position of hope. While many of his peers have advanced a grimmer view when discussing the cycles of African-American history, Lowery finds a cause for optimism in our era's developing racial-justice movement. After the grand jury in Ferguson chose not to indict Officer Darren Wilson, many warned of rioting; instead, protesters took to the streets in droves to denounce this miscarriage of justice. As we settle into the next four years of Trump's presidency, it's hard to embrace fully Lowery's sense of hope and possibility. But the quiet optimism underlying his book is itself an act of protest in our dark times. As the Ferguson protesters, quoting Kendrick Lamar, insisted to Lowery: \"We gon' be alright.\"\n\nMany mainstream-media outlets have missed this larger context. Instead of trying to understand how the protests in St. Louis or Baltimore are linked to a much longer history of political struggle, journalists often descend on these cities to get a sensational photo or to break breathless news reports about the confrontations between police and protesters. Rather than looking at the long-standing patterns of police harassment or examining the ways in which these municipalities rely on the frequent ticketing of their black citizens for funds, many newspapers have run stories that indict the victims of police violence, not the officers who killed them or the larger system in which they operate. \"And by focusing on the character of the victim,\" Lowery writes, \"we inadvertently take the focus off the powerful and instead train our eyes and judgment on the powerless.\" Lowery also takes the media to task for overstating the importance of their role in social movements. It's true that without journalists covering the civil-rights movement, many Americans might not have been persuaded of the justness of its cause. But Lowery believes that reporters often exaggerate their influence on the shaping of social movements. One can hear a bit of self-criticism here as well. After all, Lowery is himself a journalist who hopes that his reporting may help provide a fairer and more accurate account of Black Lives Matter. In this way, these critical asides come not from a frustrated outsider, but from a respected mainstream journalist attempting to change the way his colleagues report on the movement as a whole. T he book tells a bleak story, but Lowery concludes on a relatively optimistic note. Although the nation's future looks uncertain and there is much work left to do, in the end, he insists, both the rallying cry and the activism of Black Lives Matter will endure. (Of course, Lowery wrote his book before the election of Donald Trump, so he can be forgiven for not adopting a more ominous tone.) And by certain measures, the movement has been a notable success: BLM protests have been able to put and keep the issue of police brutality at the forefront of the national conversation; the movement has forced politicians to begin to speak the language of Black Lives Matter; and because of public pressure in the wake of Ferguson and Baltimore, a small number of police officers have been charged with shooting unarmed citizens.

As the Ferguson protesters, quoting Kendrick Lamar, insisted to Lowery: \"We gon' be alright.\"\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

      "text": "Has Black Lives Matter Changed the World?\n\nHow should we think about the Black Lives Matter movement, now that three years have passed since the worldwide George Floyd protests? In sympathetic circles, the question does not usually inspire a direct answer, but, rather, a seemingly endless set of caveats and follow-up questions. What constitutes success? What changes could possibly be expected in such a short period of time? Are we talking about actual policies or are we talking about changed minds? I've engaged in this type of back-and-forth on several occasions during the past few years, and, though I believe the protests were, on balance, a force for good in this country, I wonder whether all this chin-scratching suggests a lack of conviction. Why don't we have a clearer answer?\n\nIn his new book, \" After Black Lives Matter ,\" the political scientist Cedric Johnson blows right past the sort of hemming and hawing that has become de rigueur in today's conversations about the George Floyd protests. Johnson chooses, instead, to level a provocative and expansive critique from the left of the loose collection of protest actions, organizations, and ideological movements-whether prison abolition or calls to defund the police -that make up what we now call Black Lives Matter . He agrees that unchecked police power is a societal ill that should inspire vigorous dissent. His problem is more with the \"Black Lives Matter\" part-not the assertion, itself, which should be self-evident, but, rather, how the shaping of the slogan and its main beneficiaries (Johnson believes these are mostly corporate entities) promoted a totalizing and obscurantist vision of race and power.\n\nMuch like Barbara Fields and Adolph Reed , two Black scholars cited in the book, Johnson is a socialist, and his argument is \"inspired and informed by the left-wing of antipolicing struggles,\" which he takes great care to distinguish from what he sees as the more corporatized and popular vision of Black Lives Matter, and the naïvete of the police-abolition movement. He does not dismiss the pernicious impact that racism has upon the lives of people in this country, but he does not see much potential in a movement that focusses on race alone, nor does he believe that it accurately assesses the problem with policing. He writes:\n\nDuring the 2020 George Floyd protests, the politics of Black Lives Matter seemed especially militant and stood in sharp contrast to the pro-policing, authoritarian posturing and hubris of the Trump administration. The fundamental BLM demand, that black lives equally deserve protections guaranteed under the Constitution, momentarily achieved majority-national support. Through slogans like the \"New Jim Crow\" and \"Black Lives Matter,\" the problem of expansive carceral power was codified as a uniquely black predicament. Police violence, however, is not meted out against the black population en masse but is trained on the most dispossessed segments of the working class across metropolitan, small town and rural geographies.\n\nThe police , in other words, enact violence against all poor people, because, in a capitalist country like the United States, the police serve primarily to reproduce \"the market economy, processes of real estate development in central cities and the management of surplus populations.\" Poor rural whites, Black people who live in the inner cities, Latinos in depressed agricultural districts, and Native Americans across the country can all be tagged as surplus, and Johnson argues that this condition has a much more direct and meaningful impact on how they are policed than race does. He also believes that the focus on race serves bourgeois interests, because it reduces the question of inequality in this country to skin color; this, in turn, obviates any discussion about how an improvement in basic living standards -health care, housing, child care, and education-could make communities safer. If all you have to do is expunge the racism in the hearts of police officers, or, perhaps, just reduce the number of racist patrol officers on the streets, you don't have to do much about poverty. Or, at the very least, you can pretend that class conflict and racialized police brutality are two separate issues, when, in fact, they are the same thing.\n\n\"After Black Lives Matter\" should be commended both for the clarity of its message and the bravery of its convictions. Even among scholars on the left who are critical of identity politics, there's a wide range of responses to popular works such as \" The 1619 Project \"or Ibram X. Kendi 's Antiracist series , which seem to focus on race above all other things. Some, like Olúfẹ́mi O. Táíwò , level a more capacious critique of identity politics, even in its most crass and capitalistic forms: though Táíwò may object to the approach and analyses of so-called identitarians, he still sees them as his teammates. Others, like Fields and Reed, are far more dismissive. Johnson certainly falls in this second camp. He rails against \"wokelords,\" who are keen to shame and confront anyone who may offer up a critique of identity politics; he believes that modern racial-justice discourse \"prompts liberal solutions, such as implicit bias training, body cameras, hiring more black police officers and administrators,\" which, in turn, \"erects unnecessary barriers between would-be allies.\"\n\nJohnson argues that, although Black Lives Matter may have dressed itself up in revolutionary clothing, it ultimately still followed the differential logic of a corporate diversity training: one group of people is asked to acknowledge another and fixate on points of difference. \"BLM discourse truncates the policing problem as one of endemic antiblackness, and cuts off potential constituencies,\" he writes, \"treating other communities who have suffered police abuse and citizens who are deeply committed to achieving social justice as merely allies, junior partners rather than political equals and comrades.\"\n\nWhat emerges from \"After Black Lives Matter\" is a type of pragmatism, one that looks to build solidarity across racial lines. White people, especially poor white people, are also killed by the police, as are poor Latinos and poor Asians. Any change-whether revolutionary, legislative, or reformative-will require a critical mass of people who feel that their own interests are at stake in an anti-policing movement. Black Lives Matter, Johnson argues, may have been effective in getting people out on the streets because of its manipulation of digital platforms, but it also had wide appeal because it did not truly challenge the capitalist, neoliberal order. The reason so many corporations, for example, were so quick to offer funds for Black creators or anti-racism efforts wasn't that they felt intimidated by what was happening in the streets, but because they saw a shift in how the country felt about race and quickly moved to adjust their optics without touching the underlying exploitative practices. In the summer of 2020, oil companies, multinational banks, the C.I.A., the N.F.L. all came out with commitments to Black Lives Matter. Johnson sees this as \"an instance of ideological convergence-between the militant racial liberalism of Black Lives Matter and the operational racial liberalism of the investor class.\" A truly transformative movement, then, would be broad and inclusive in its messaging, and also radical in its critique and democratic in its methods.\n\nJohnson's pragmatism also extends to the debates around defunding or abolishing the police. He reminds the reader that, at certain points in American history, \"state coercion was necessary to secure racial justice.\" Desegregation, for example, required the support of federal marshals and National Guardsmen, even if it also was opposed, violently, by the local law enforcement. Johnson advocates, instead, to \"right-size\" and \"demilitarize\" the police, but argues that \"it seems rather naive to think that a complex, populous urban society can exist without any law enforcement at all, especially in those moments when forces threaten social justice and even the basic democratic rights of citizens.\"\n\nJohnson's own prescription is to \"abolish the class conditions that modern policing has come to manage.\" He argues that any real change to policing will not come from a \"mass rejection of racism,\" but instead a \"shared vision of the good society.\" Eliminating racism, Johnson concedes, is a worthwhile goal, but the essentialist vision of race and the way that it narrows down the conversation about change in society down to one group-namely, Black Americans-will always be limited to the oppressed-and-ally relationship, which creates barriers instead of searching for common grievances. The alternative, Johnson argues, is \"broadly redistributive left politics centered on public goods\" that would ultimately allow for \"powerful coalitions built on shared self-interests\" to emerge.\n\nI am sympathetic to Johnson's critique, not only because I also see the limits of identity politics but also because I have seen the needlessly divisive and dispiriting ideology of racial essentialism in action at protests around the country. I've written about many of these instances in the past, whether the \"wall of white allies\" I saw in Minnesota or the harsh reprimand a white protester received from a Black organizer for daring to talk to a reporter. (Her offense, as far as I could tell, wasn't speaking to the press, but, rather, \"centering herself.\") These types of instances, which weren't exactly common, but did recur during my years of reporting on protests, may have been interesting on an intellectual level-seeing theory in action is always a bit thrilling. But they also convinced me that not much action could come from a movement that endlessly polices its own \"allies.\" I do not think people stay allies for very long, but I do believe that they act in their self-interests for a lifetime. Therefore, if one is committed to profoundly changing policing, the work will require convincing as many people as possible that they, too, can be abused and killed by the police.\n\nBut there's also a profound contradiction that I haven't quite been able to square in my own head, and perhaps never will. Johnson is correct in saying that Black Lives Matter, by explicit design, elevated the concerns of Black people over those of others who may have been targeted by the police. But it was this message, and not a broader anti-capitalist critique, which has captivated millions of people for almost a decade now. This message was the one that ultimately resonated, not only in the United States but also in protests around the world.\n\nThere were people I saw in every march I attended, from Ferguson to the Floyd protests, who truly did believe that they were doing revolutionary work in the name of Black Lives Matter. In the summer of 2020, I saw nervous first-timers who had no love for corporate remediations on race and were ready to leave their homes and march out into the streets. It is the job of scholars and critics, like Johnson and me, to think about what it all might have meant, yet I don't think it's really possible to take an event as large as the summer of 2020 and make such a broad, declarative assessment of the political motivations behind all of it.\n\nEarly in the book, Johnson makes the distinction between organized power and mass mobilization. The sheer size and diversity of the Floyd protests pointed to the latter-something he says is \"much easier now with the endless opportunities for expressing discontent provided by social media, online petitions, memes and vlogging.\" In describing the difference, Johnson is asking the profound political question of the past twenty years: Does the ephemeral nature of social media dilute the power of street protest? Does it turn everything into online symbology , and give the people who show up a false sense that they have accomplished something real?\n\nI wonder, perhaps naïvely, whether we simply need more time to accurately gauge the gains of the summer of 2020. A group of unpopular activists was able to overturn Roe v. Wade after fifty years of planning and organizing. The actual mechanisms for change may have wound through the courts, but anti-abortion activists still had to create the circumstances, whether by influencing conservative legal scholars, fostering their own like Amy Coney Barrett, or even just keeping things together through decades of opposition.\n\nOn the left, social movements find their inspiration and fuel from protests, and it's worth giving credit where it's due: if not for Black Lives Matter, millions of people might not have explicitly come out into the streets of America to protest the conditions that give rise to police violence. And the demonstrations of 2020 also gave rise to other forms of solidarity. Under the banner of the George Floyd protests, many labor unions, including the Oakland chapter of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, staged their own actions. These exposed attendees to the differences between working-class solidarity and the types of neoliberal identity politics that only ask for small reforms that do not challenge wealth inequality or even the criminal-justice system in any profound way. Perhaps there is a way to excise the bad part of these mass protests from the good, and still maintain a mass presence on the streets. But, if there is, I have yet to see it in action. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "A Black Lives Matter Co-Founder Explains Why This Time Is Different\n\nIn 2013, the community organizers Opal Tometi, Patrisse Cullors, and Alicia Garza started the Black Lives Matter movement. What began as a hashtag in response to Trayvon Martin's death became a nationwide phenomenon, with protests in response to the killings of African-Americans and chapters across the country. Now, after the death of George Floyd , at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer, and a week of nationwide protests to an extent unseen in a half century, Black Lives Matter is once again the biggest story in the country.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, I spoke by phone with Tometi, who advises a number of black-led organizations and previously served as the executive director of the Black Alliance for Just Immigration. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed what it would mean to defund police departments, how the coronavirus pandemic has shaped the American response to the protests, and what's next for Black Lives Matter.\n\nHow are these protests different from what came before, and why do you think they are different from what came before?\n\nWhile we see that a lot of anger and outrage and frustration was sparked by the barbaric murder of George Floyd, it's also clear to me that we have been sitting in our homes, navigating the pandemic, dealing with loved ones being sick, dealing with a great deal of fear and concern about what the day and the future will hold. We have millions of people who have lost their jobs and filed for unemployment and are living paycheck to paycheck and hand to mouth, and I believe they are just thoroughly fed up and thoroughly beside themselves with grief and concern and despair because the government does not seem to have a plan of action that is dignified and comprehensive and seeks to address the core concerns that the average American has.\n\nAnd so my belief and my view of these protests is that they are different because they are marked by a period that has been deeply personal to millions of Americans and residents of the United States, and that has them more tender or sensitive to what is going on. People who would normally have been at work now have time to go to a protest or a rally, and have time to think about why they have been struggling so much, and they are thinking, This actually isn't right and I want to make time, and I have the ability to make time now and make my concerns heard. So I think it is markedly differently in terms of the volume of demands we are hearing. People are absolutely lifting up names like Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd, but I think they are very clearly in the streets for themselves and their family members because they don't know who is next, and they are also concerned about the economic realities that they are faced with.\n\nIt's interesting that your answer focussed so little on criminal justice specifically. Is it just that the criminal-justice issues have been going on forever and so these additional things were needed, or is there something different about the way society is reacting to criminal-justice outrages in 2020?\n\nI absolutely think people are concerned with police brutality. Let me make that absolutely clear. We have been fighting and advocating to stop a war on black lives. And that is how we see it-this is a war on black life. And people understand that this system is filled with all sorts of inequality and injustice, and that implicit bias and just outright racism is embedded in the way that policing is done in this nation-and when you think about it historically, it was founded as a slave patrol. The evolution of policing was rooted in that. People recognize that. So their frustration is absolutely about the policing and the criminal-justice system writ large and the racial dimensions of it, and its lethal impact on our communities.\n\nBut I would say that there is something about the economic conditions in addition to the lethal force we are seeing every day that makes this moment feel different, where people are making different kinds of demands. We do a lot of work with the Movement for Black Lives and a number of organizations and individuals and different leaders who are part of that formation, and we have been calling for the defunding of police, a moratorium on rent, a moratorium on mortgages and utilities. We need to not have people's utilities shut off-their light, their water, and just basic needs that people have.\n\nSo our demands are also reflective of the fact that when we started Black Lives Matter, it wasn't solely about police brutality and extrajudicial killing. That was a spark point, but it was very intentional for us to talk about the way that black lives are cut short all across the board. You can talk about the quality of our life in terms of housing and education and health-care systems and the pandemic and what we are seeing there. So for us it has been more comprehensive than just the criminal-justice system and policing. It's bigger than that.\n\nIs it important that a specific agenda is heard from protesters, or is that the job of other people?\n\nA specific agenda like?\n\nPeople showing up at protests with signs listing specific reforms.\n\nYou know, I think it is important that we have those types of things, but I also believe that what we are witnessing now is the opening up of imaginations, where people are beginning to think more expansively about what the solutions could be. We have our solutions. We want the rights of protesters to be respected. We want a divestment from the police and an investment in black communities. We are demanding immediate relief for our communities. We want community control. We want an end to this war against black people. So we are clear in our demands, and we have demands for each city, so each city has its own unique demands, especially cities that are very active in these protests right now.  You will see that local organizers have been working on the ground for years, and have already had their own reports and series of policies, and so what we are looking to do is amplify those.\n\nI have seen African-American activists say two things about the protests becoming more violent-and in this case I don't mean the violence from the police. The first is that talking about this is a distraction from what really matters, and the other is that it is bad and takes attention away from the peaceful majority. How do you feel about that conversation?\n\nI think that conversation is complicated, and, generally speaking, I just don't equate the loss of life and the loss of property. I can't even hold those two in the same regard, and I think for far too long we have seen that happen. We have had these conversations where we are conflating very different realities and operating from different value systems. So, for me, that's how I view it, and a lot of my colleagues and peers as well as mentors have similar views. We are really focussed on how to get our demands out and stay focussed on the main thing, which is people, and we want to value our love of people over property.\n\nI asked because I wanted you to lay out what defunding police would look like in practice. Additionally, I was wondering if you think that demand is a harder sell if things appear to people to be out of control.\n\nTheir budgets are overly bloated. And we can see this in many ways, but I think the most symbolic ways-and not even symbolic, it's material-are that we see they are militarized and we see all the equipment they have been able to lay out overnight or in hours. So we know they have a vast amount of resources.\n\nEarly on, when we first started Black Lives Matter, about a year or two into its creation, I worked with some amazing comrades in New York, and we worked on this campaign called \"Safety Beyond Policing.\" The New York City government was saying that it was going to allocate a hundred million dollars for a thousand new police officers. And here I am, a B.L.M. co-founder, on the heels of the murder of Eric Garner, thinking to myself, How are these people going to unleash even more police officers in our communities, when clearly we are seeing that enough is enough? This overpolicing of largely poor communities, which are largely people of color because poverty is racialized in this country, means that we are the ones interacting with law enforcement more. And with all this racial bias, of course, we see this brutality and these murders.\n\nAnd so we started this campaign for community members to really be involved in the conversation about how to keep ourselves safe without an overreliance on law enforcement. And what we concluded is that we need social workers. We need these resources to go to our social workers and educators. We need it to go to our schools. We would love to have mental-health professionals when we have certain crises in our communities. We would like to not have a charge when we jump the turnstile because we don't have money for a subway ticket, and jobs programs for our youth during the summer. People were very creative, and they knew exactly what they needed. It was very easy for people to come to these conclusions as to what safety could look like.\n\nAnd so I say all this to say that, yes, a defunding of police looks like an investment in the community, and I think it is perfectly fine, and we have seen it before and we just need a lot more of it. And I think it is a slap in the face when local governments see what is happening with their police precincts and beyond and still say, \"We are going to allocate even more money for this thing that is clearly not working.\" If you had a job and were messing up this badly and it had a lethal outcome, you would be fired. It doesn't make sense that we continue on this.\n\nDon't give my boss any ideas.\n\nYou're good.\n\nShould the role for Black Lives Matter be any different now from what it was when it began?\n\nSo in 2013, and even 2014, we began more as a platform and a space to develop community and share analysis. In 2013, George Zimmerman is acquitted for the murder of Trayvon Martin. Alicia writes a Facebook post. I reached out to her. I didn't know Patrisse at the time, but she puts a hashtag on it. I buy the domain name. And we start to use this hashtag as our umbrella language, and we share it with other community organizers in our network. And then 2014 happens, when Michael Brown is murdered. We are reeling and shocked and seeing how different people in Ferguson are met with a militarized police force, and that gets us going again and we do a Black Lives Matter Freedom Ride. So hundreds of us are on the ground and from that point we develop a network, because people are like, Hey, Fergusons are everywhere, and we don't want to just go back home and act like this was a one-off act of solidarity. We want to do something. And that was essentially the beginning of our network.\n\nAnd it has always been somewhat decentralized. We have tried various structures, but we have always said the power goes on in the local chapter because they know what is going on, and they are the ones familiar with the terrain. Our chapters are the ones leading. We have had some come and go. I am getting e-mails where people are trying to set up chapters again, so there is always momentum, and ebbs and flows, and there is especially momentum when there is a tragedy like the ones we have witnessed in recent times. People want to create a chapter and rise up.\n\nBut it is largely still the same, I will say that. There are chapters across the country, many of them are operational and do their own fund-raising, and make their demands, and then, of course, they are in communication with one another, and that is the other beautiful thing. We end up seeing that there are commonalities and trends in what is going on with different police forces or other issues. So some chapters are more focussed in the education system. Some are more focussed on working with sex workers who are abused. So different chapters might take on different issues, but there is this throughline of valuing black life and understanding that we are not a monolith but being radically inclusive in terms of chapter makeup.\n\nIf we are in a once-in-a-century calamity that will overwhelmingly affect African-Americans, and I am talking about the coronavirus, what might that mean for the movement going forward?\n\nLet me just take a beat and think how I want to answer that, because I think it is what is weighing on all of us right now. Honestly, I think we have to be seemingly ambitious with our demands. But they are not really ambitious. They are really just basic. What I articulated earlier is really just the baseline of what we know we need, not just what we know we want. We need the harm to stop in our communities. We need the damage to be repaired. We need to be able to have the opportunity to have a life of dignity, and the possibility to thrive. We need all of those things. So from the divestment from policing, to the investment in our communities, these all feel like very core and baseline demands. So we are going to push those.\n\nBut what we have been doing in the interim-even before these large protests and rallies-is a lot of mutual-aid work. The organization I used to lead, Black Alliance For Just Immigration -I was the director there for about ten years, and worked with black immigrants and refugees and African-Americans as well-the new director is amazing and has been doing a lot of work in utilizing a mutual-aid model of collecting resources, be it money or food or different skills embedded in the community, so people can show up for one other and the concerns and need we have. And we are going to continue seeing that. I think that is one of the most effective and empowering ways for us to resist in this moment, and really practice our own sense of responsibility. But we do need government response. We have already seen massive unemployment and we will see more. So we need comprehensive responses to the pandemic, that are about  both health and economics.\n\nHow concerned are you about health issues at the protests?\n\nConcern about the pandemic is high, but people are also very clear that you can sit at home and also be affected by this illness, or you can go out and fight for a chance to live a life full of dignity, and they are willing to risk it. I think we have to sit with the profundity of this moment, and what it really means for people to say, \"You know what, we are in this health crisis yet I cannot stay in my house. There is too much at stake. I am going to make an informed decision, and I am going out against all odds because it is worth it and the status quo is intolerable.\" I am really amazed and so moved by the thousands if not millions of courageous people who have made the decision to go to the streets. I am so in awe of them. They are so brave, and those are the people our country has needed for so long.\n\nYou can always wear a mask.\n\nAnd you can always wear a mask. And people are doing it. [Laughs.] And people are doing their best to be safe at these rallies and marches. I have seen a lot of that and am grateful for it.\n\nOne thing I just want to underscore is that the world is watching us. We see these rallies in solidarity emerging all across the globe, and I have friends texting me with their images in France and the Netherlands and Costa Rica, and people are showing me that they are showing up in solidarity. People are really trying to show up in this moment for black people, but I think they are also doing it because they have been mad for a minute, almost like this pandemic was a pause, and they were able to think about what would justice look like, and what is actually going on, and they have been able to reflect on what is going on. I think they have been not O.K. for so many years, and they are finally saying, \"Hey, we are going to take it to the streets and say we are going to show up in solidarity with you.\"\n\nI also think people are looking at the United States and think that we weren't able to have a comprehensive plan to deal with the pandemic. They are watching how over a hundred thousand people have died so far, and they are also seeing the racial dimensions of it. Almost a third of the people dying have been black, and we are only thirteen per cent of the population. So much of this is inconceivable but it is staring us right in the face. So I think there is a lot of pressure that is mounting in this moment, and I just hope that our government chooses to do the right thing. I think this is just the beginning.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "How Black Lives Matter Came to the Academy\n\nOn a Saturday night in early June, Shardé Davis, an assistant professor in the Department of Communication at the University of Connecticut, was sitting on a couch in a rented apartment in San Diego, scrolling through her Twitter feed. She was in California to do research on a project that was funded by a Ford Foundation postdoctoral fellowship-plans that had been affected somewhat by COVID -19 and the widespread protests for racial justice. Davis herself had gone to a Black Lives Matter protest in La Mesa the previous weekend. The event had started out peacefully but turned ugly when California Highway Patrol officers squared off with thousands of protesters on the I-8 freeway. There were reports of bottles thrown, tear gas unleashed, arson, and looting.\n\nA week later, after attending another protest, Davis still couldn't calm down. As she sat alone on her couch, ruminating about the murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor and news coverage of the La Mesa protest-the crowd had been mostly white and Latinx, she said, but the media made it seem as though Black folks were the ones destroying property-she felt more and more enraged.\n\nShe asked herself repeatedly, \"What can I do?\" She was already thinking about what it would look like for universities to cut ties with police departments. \"I think I was just drawing the very obvious connections,\" she said. \"Academia is seen as a very liberal and progressive place, but systemic racism is running through all of these different institutions.\"\n\nAlthough she was not an avid Twitter user, Davis came up with the hashtag #BlackInTheIvory, thinking it might be a good way for Black people to share their stories about racism in her sphere of influence. \"Folks tout the liberal ivory tower,\" she told me. \"They hide behind it.\"\n\nShe texted a friend, Joy Melody Woods, a doctoral student in the Moody College of Communication at the University of Texas at Austin, to see what she thought of the hashtag idea. \"I love it,\" Woods replied from her iPhone. \"Already tweeted it out.\" Davis followed suit, using the hashtag while retweeting a physician named Shaquita Bell: \"Black individuals in the United States have endured events in our everyday life without an audience or validation of our experiences.\"\n\nThe next morning, Davis and Woods found their notification in-boxes filled with hundreds of tweets from Black academics and graduate students, sharing their stories of exclusion and pain. By Sunday night, #BlackInTheIvory was one of the top twenty hashtags in the country. #BlackInTheIvory is being asked during your first week of college if you're sure you can handle it, many said, or being asked on campus if you're in the right place or \"lost.\" #BlackInTheIvory is having campus security constantly ask for your research-lab badge, residence-hall identification, and/or driver's license. Marc Edwards, now an assistant professor of biology at Amherst College, recalled that, in graduate school, at another institution, a dean suggested he wear a tie to class in response to incessant profiling. #BlackInTheIvory is being thrashed in student evaluations for discussing racial injustice, Danielle Clealand, a political scientist at the University of Texas at Austin, wrote. And my personal favorite: #BlackInTheIvory is being asked to serve on endless diversity committees and write endless diversity reports, without regard for one's labor or time, also known as the \"Black tax.\" To drive the point home, Woods and Davis posted Venmo bar codes on their Twitter feeds for anyone who might care to contribute.\n\nThe movement took off, with feature stories in Nature , The Chronicle of Higher Education , NBCNews.com , and the Boston Globe . Davis and Woods created a Web site, which sold branded merchandise and launched an effort to match Black graduate students in need with donors. \"Not the Diversity Hire,\" read the text on one coffee mug.\n\n\"You're finally seeing people opening up and sharing these experiences,\" Woods said. \"We had been feeling like we were alone.\"\n\nWhen Woods and I spoke in June, she told me the story of her own experience as an incoming graduate student. In the fall of 2016, she was the only Black student on her track in a master's program in public health at the University of Iowa. The college had no Black faculty, and Woods said that professors made it clear that she didn't belong, that she wasn't smart enough. One professor told her directly that she \"didn't have the skills to be a graduate student.\"\n\n\"I was feeling maybe I am dumb,\" she said. \"I thought I was going insane. I would just be on the floor crying.\"\n\nToward the end of her first semester, Woods tried reporting one faculty member to the university's Office of Equal Opportunity and Diversity, but the complaint went nowhere. \"It's hard to prove microaggressions,\" she said. \"That's why we think we're going crazy.\"\n\nIn Woods's second semester of graduate school, a private psychologist tested her for learning disabilities. She discovered that she had three: a reading impairment, a visual-spatial processing disability, and a nonverbal learning disability. The psychologist told Woods that she didn't know how she had managed to finish high school. Yet her professors refused to provide learning accommodations, as is required by law. (In response, a spokesperson from the college said that \"we have made progress since 2016, but it is not enough. We are determined to do better.\")\n\nSo she left. \"Walked right across the bridge,\" as she put it, transferring to the College of Education, where she found three Black professors, an Asian-American adviser, and far more Black students in her classes. \"I was never the 'only' anymore,\" she said. The course readings also featured more diverse authors, and, because they explicitly addressed issues of inequality, it was easier to have open conversations about racism. In her new program, Woods completed a master's degree in Educational Policy and Leadership Studies with an emphasis on the sociology of education.\n\nBut, in many ways, Woods is an exception. Both of her parents have bachelor's degrees in electrical engineering, and her two older sisters have graduate degrees in medicine and science. Many other Black students leave graduate programs in despair, but Woods felt that her family simply wouldn't accept her defeat.\n\nShe persisted, but her education came at a cost. \"These experiences are traumatic ,\" Woods said. They can be isolating and emotionally battering. The problem of being the \"first and the only\" Black person in any institution is that being alone makes it much easier for white majorities to dismiss one's perceptions.\n\nAs a doctoral student at the University of California, Santa Cruz, I experienced the same isolation and resentment that Black women are now once again shouting about from their Twitter-feed rooftops. I know all too well what #BlackInTheIvory is about. I was already writing about my time in graduate school when I came across the hashtag. It took a moment for its meaning to sink in. For so long, I had recalled my experiences in isolation, pushing them to the corners of my memory and doing my best to make them small. #BlackInTheIvory reminded me that, like Woods, I wasn't alone.\n\nIn 1988, I was the first Black woman to enroll in my Ph.D. program in ten years. I was there, really, only because my undergraduate mentor, Elliott Butler-Evans, a Black professor in English at the University of California, Santa Barbara, had insisted on it. He had attended the program and received his own Ph.D. there, some years earlier. He told me about the dearth of Black women with tenure in the U.C. system. In his eyes, getting a doctorate was my civic duty. So I went to graduate school.\n\nThere were seven incoming students at the history-of-consciousness program at U.C. Santa Cruz that year: five white men and women, me, and a Chicano from Los Angeles named Raul. One afternoon, the conversation in our first-year seminar turned to race.\n\nOur professors for the seminar, Donna Haraway and Jim Clifford, were two of the most formidable minds I had ever met. The conversation was stimulating, as I recall. Something about how racial meaning is socially constructed, perhaps, rather than strictly biological. I was only just beginning to wrap my head around post-structuralism and \"theory,\" and the concepts were still fresh and new. But it soon became apparent that a young woman in our cohort was becoming agitated. I'll call her Mary. She shifted in her seat as though biting her tongue.\n\n\"It's just that I'm Italian-American and . . . I get really tan in the summer,\" Mary said. She paused, searching the room. It seemed that no one had a clue what she was getting at. Raul and I exchanged confused looks, waiting for her to complete her thought.\n\n\"I mean, I get even darker than her ,\" she said, crooking her chin in my direction. And that's when she hit me with it. \"So . . . I don't understand, why does she get to be Black?\"\n\nI wish I could say that anyone had a good response to what Mary had said. If they did, I don't recall. I remember only the silence.\n\nI was isolated in a program in which not a single student or faculty member looked like me, or my mother, or my grandmother, or anyone in my family. All around me were hippie-like surfer students, white kids who found it perfectly acceptable to walk the woodsy paths barefoot on a warm day, or to wear their straight hair in clumped mats. For so many of them, college was an inevitable part of growing up. They treated the privilege with a certain casualness that I, as a first-generation student, did not share.\n\nAnd, although I didn't think of it that way at the time, I crossed a bridge that year in search of bolstering, just like Joy Woods. I made my way across campus, over to Kresge College, where I found the writer Gloria Anzaldúa working on a doctorate in literature. Gloria called herself a Chicana-Mexicana-mestiza. She had edited a seminal book for Black and brown feminists, \" This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color ,\" that was mandatory reading in women's-studies courses across the country. I also found Ekua Omosupe, an African-American single mom from Mississippi. We three became friends. I was no longer alone.\n\n\"I'm putting together another anthology,\" Gloria told me one day, \"and I was wondering if you have any essays or poems you'd like to contribute?\" She did that thing which is so often missing from our lives as Black scholars and academics. Nurturing .\n\n\"It doesn't have to be polished. Just send me what you have.\" My essay, which I called \"Light-Skinned'ded Naps,\" appeared in \"Making Face, Making Soul/Haciendo Caras\" the next year. It was my first published piece of writing. I was twenty-three years old.\n\nNot long afterward, the literature department brought the novelists Toni Cade Bambara and Buchi Emecheta to campus, as distinguished visiting professors, and my life changed again. I became their teaching assistant, crossing campus regularly to commune with my newfound Black community.\n\nOne day, after class, I walked with Toni back to her office. The day was bright and impossibly blue-which made her next words seem incongruous. She pulled a small AM radio from her pocket. \"Always carry a short-wave radio,\" she told me. \"For when the revolution comes.\" I loved her commitment to revolutionary ideas, and to Black people, and to me.\n\nI plopped myself down in a chair in her office, continuing our conversation. Mostly, I was hungry for her affirmation, which she gave freely. Years later, I found an old cassette tape of an interview she gave for my dissertation, on nationalist desire in Black television, film, and literature. Playing it back, I was mortified to discover that I had done most of the talking. Toni listened patiently, offering \"mm-hmm\"s in all the right places.\n\nWith Buchi, a Nigerian novelist, one day in particular stands out in my memory. She stood before a class of white students, pausing to survey a Douglas fir outside the window.\n\n\"For you, the trees and the forest are very beautiful,\" she said. \"Beau-ti-ful,\" she repeated, enunciating each syllable with her thick, British accent. \"But for me I see something more in the forests.\"\n\nUh-oh. I surveyed the room, sensing what was coming.\n\n\"I see fear and danger.\" She pronounced this last word \" dan -jah,\" allowing it to linger in the coffee-scented air for a beat or two. \"You just don't know who might be behind those trees.\" The class considered her words in silence. She was right, and they knew it, although I doubt that a Black person had ever said this to them before in quite that way.\n\n\"And, if something happens, well, then . . . I'm just another Black woman gone. I wouldn't even get two sentences in the newspaper.\" Buchi paused, allowing students to sit with their discomfort awhile. One rustled papers. Another crossed and uncrossed her legs.\n\nBuchi smiled, shifting the mood. \"Well . . . you know.\" Her expression turned playful. \"Since I am Buchi, I might get two or three lines.\"\n\nThere was relieved laughter.\n\nThe next year, two Latinas and another Black woman enrolled in my program, across campus, and, because there was now a critical mass of students of color, we rallied and demanded that the department hire a Black woman professor. Because that is precisely how these things work. There is power in numbers.\n\nThe university heard our demands, and, in 1990, the scholar and activist Angela Davis became the first person of color ever to join the full-time faculty in the history-of-consciousness program. She arrived just as I was leaving. And, although I didn't get to take any classes with her, she supported me by serving on my dissertation committee.\n\nThe resurgence of Black Lives Matter and the launch of #BlackInTheIvory happened in June, when most universities were already online, owing to COVID -19, and wrapping up the semester. Faculty and administrators did not yet feel widespread pressure to address race. That would soon change.\n\nAt Hofstra University, on Long Island, where I've taught journalism for the past thirteen years, a handful of my colleagues created the Black Faculty Council to address issues of systemic racism and bias. The group outlined a list of twelve recommendations, including making public the number and rank of Black faculty on campus (a figure that hovers between four and six per cent nationally); providing mandatory anti-racism and anti-Black-bias training for students, faculty, staff, and administration; and disclosing details about complaints regarding the department of public safety and campus policing. A coalition of Black students sent their own eight-page list of demands to administrators-which included a zero-tolerance hate-speech policy, more diversity among professors, support for Black mental health, a revitalization of the Africana-studies program, and mandatory undergraduate requirements for courses on race and racism in the United States.\n\nAcross the country, we've seen similar pockets of change, some more radical than others. The University of Chicago announced that it would admit only Black-studies scholars into its English Ph.D. program for 2021, citing Black Lives Matter. Similarly, the Rhode Island School of Design said that it would hire ten new faculty members focussed on race, decolonization, and cultural representation-a move that was made possible by an anonymous donation large enough to pay their salaries for the next five years. The California State University system is phasing in a requirement that all students on its twenty-three campuses take at least one ethnic-studies course. The University of Pittsburgh required its first-year students to complete an online course on systemic anti-Black racism in the fall.\n\nStudents and faculty nationwide have expressed their unwillingness to continue on as before. They've insisted on confronting white power structures directly and challenging the myriad ways in which America's racial hierarchy is ingrained in academic institutions. In November, about seven hundred and eighty students participated in a two-week strike at Haverford College, in response to what they saw as an insensitive e-mail from the school's president, Wendy Raymond, who had been serving as the interim chief diversity officer at the time. The e-mail urged students not to participate in protests after police fatally shot Walter Wallace, Jr., a twenty-seven-year-old Uber Eats driver, during a domestic dispute near the college. Students ended their strike after receiving a commitment from college administrators to meet the majority of their demands .\n\nWhite officials like Raymond aren't the only ones struggling. In August, after a difficult conversation with Shardé Davis over the future of their movement, Joy Woods announced that she would no longer be associated with #BlackInTheIvory, removing her name from the Web site and Twitter account. Many who had donated funds felt betrayed, vowing to return merchandise purchased on the site. Both the site and the official Twitter handle @BlackintheIvory have been inactive since September.\n\nStill, #BlackInTheIvory lives on, having taken on an identity that is larger than its founders. \"The visibility of this hashtag allowed institutions to start to have conversations that people have been begging them to have for years,\" Woods told me when I caught up with her in November. \"I still get messages from people saying, 'You gave me courage to finally say something.' \"\n\nDavis agreed, citing a recent speech she had given about #BlackInTheIvory at the University of Northampton, in England. \"For so long we barely talked about racism,\" she said. \"Now I feel like that's actually happening. This has opened the door in a really powerful way.\"\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "A Black Lives Matter Founder on Building Modern Movements\n\nJoe Biden may have been calculated in his efforts to project calm and stability in the waning weeks of the campaign, but the soothing influence of the incoming Biden Administration has been decisively undercut by the post-election stunts of Donald Trump, which erupted, on January 6th, into an open insurrection . As the U.S. remains mired in the coronavirus pandemic, the debates over the provision of health care and housing have become even more intense, if not desperate. Just as fraught are the unresolved questions concerning the grip of racism. Despite all of the platitudes and pledges to end \"systemic racism,\" its stain on the country has never been more apparent. African-Americans continue to be hospitalized for COVID -19 at nearly four times the rate of white people. Black unemployment , which is at nearly ten per cent, remains several points higher than the national rate. According to National Geographic , of the twenty-five U.S. counties with the highest projected food-insecurity rates, only four are majority white, and all of those are in Kentucky.\n\nThe political fault lines are not just between Democrats and Republicans. Indeed, for the former, the anxiety about the election's outcome was not limited solely to fears of what four more years of Trump could produce. Progressives were just as worried that a Biden Administration would squander the opportunity to pursue transformative reforms that the U.S. overwhelmingly needs. For all of Biden's testimony that he feels the pain of the public, those on the suffering end of the pandemic and the unemployment crisis are not in the mood for honeymoon hopefulness. They want action and results. But translating political desires into political action is a tall order. The dysfunction of the American state is part of what has compelled such passionate and prolonged political protest. Into this hectic fray, Alicia Garza , a co-founder of the Black Lives Matter Global Network and the originator of the generational slogan, has launched an extraordinarily well-timed book, \" The Purpose of Power: How We Come Together When We Fall Apart .\"\n\nGarza has been an organizer for more than twenty years, and the book is largely drawn from her experiences in a multitude of grassroots struggles. Born in Oakland in 1981, Garza has spent most of her life in Northern California. She was already active in campaigns against gentrification and police brutality when Oscar Grant III was killed by the Bay Area Rapid Transit police, on New Year's Day in 2009, just blocks from her home. It was only weeks before Barack Obama became the country's first Black President and more than two years after Ron Dellums, a Black democratic socialist, was elected mayor of Oakland. There was so much expectation that life would be different with these elected Black leaders, and then so much disappointment as murders by police pointed to more of the same. When George Zimmerman was acquitted , in July, 2013, of the murder of Trayvon Martin, Garza writes, \"I cried for who we are, who America is, that we could let a child be murdered by an adult and let that adult get away with it.\" Zimmerman's acquittal and the parlous standing of Black American life that it signified prompted Garza to post an elemental declaration on Facebook: \"Black people. I love you. I love us. Our lives matter.\"\n\nGarza's book is not centrally about Black Lives Matter, the global network and organization, nor is it about the movement that has taken on this phrase as its central slogan. In part, that reflects still palpable tensions over the origins and authors of the movement, over who is credited and who is left out. Garza rightfully demands recognition for the roles played by herself, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi in connecting activists around the country and drawing international awareness to the crisis of racist police violence in the United States, but her goals extend beyond the struggle against police brutality or even the criminal-justice system. She is primarily interested in the larger question of how to move from engaging in protests and mobilization to acquiring the political power necessary to transform the conditions in poor and working-class Black communities. For Garza, this is bigger than Black Lives Matter: really, it is a demand for a different kind of society. \"What if our leaders were as afraid to disappoint Black people as they were afraid to disappoint lobbyists, banks, and other corporate actors?\" she writes. \"When we declare that our future is Black, what we mean is that addressing the needs, concerns, hopes, and aspirations of Black people will bring about a better future for all of us.\"\n\nFor Garza, achieving this kind of social reorganization and redistribution begins with an understanding of how the deep inequities that strangle our society came to be. Early in the book, she offers a surprising discussion about the rise of the conservative right and its political consolidation during the successive terms of Ronald Reagan . This is critical context for those who compare the current iteration of Black struggle to the civil-rights movement. Even in the fury of the rebellions of the nineteen-sixties, Black rebels had a glimmer of optimism, seeing their struggles as part of a global uprising for justice and democracy. The response of Democratic Party officials to every outbreak of violence-bearing new programs and opening new veins of spending-connected activism and revolt to tangible change in people's lives. Garza's account of the consequences of Reaganism makes clear that the Black Lives Matter generation came of age in the rubble of the civil-rights era, with the retrenching politics and policies rooted in Reaganism but readily inherited by a Democratic Party all too willing to do the bidding of the right. As Garza recalls, Bill Clinton signed two landmark pieces of legislation-the crime bill of 1994 and welfare reform in 1996-that \"identified Black people as a threat to the American way of life.\" The further we got from the era of Black rebellion in the sixties, the more comfortable politicians from both parties, including Black officials, became with blaming Black communities for the conditions of inequality that existed within them. This tendency bred cynicism and disconnection. Garza writes, \"Movements shape us, and we shape them-sometimes consciously, other times unconsciously. My generation was and is still being shaped by the conservative consensus and the right's rise to power.\" The poet Reginald Dwayne Betts has described this generational cohort as the \" Bastards of the Reagan Era .\"\n\nThese conservative politics have hemmed in the horizons of both activists and ordinary people. The Democratic Party's acquiescence to the narrow world view of the right resulted in progressive movements' thinking small and organizing in sometimes inconsequential ways. Garza goes to some lengths to describe these phenomena, critiquing efforts to organize safely among the already initiated amid what she describes as throwaway culture, \"the willingness to terminate or cancel people from movements for perceived deviations.\" Garza assesses the \"barriers to becoming the movement we need to be\" as being both internal and external. Externally, she identifies \"increased repressions, a retrenchment of systemic racism, and increasingly predatory forms of capitalism\" as significant barriers to the movement. But these hardly constitute the entirety of what gets in the way. Garza attributes the internal barriers to being \"content to be the God of small things.\" She elaborates:\n\nWe can't be afraid to establish a base that is larger than the people we feel comfortable with. Movements and bases cannot be cliques of people who already know each other. We have to reach beyond the choir and take seriously the task of organizing the unorganized-the people who don't already speak the same language, the people who don't eat, sleep and breathe social justice, the people who have everything at stake and are looking to be less isolated and more connected and who want to win changes in their lives and the lives of the people they love.\n\nIt is worth pointing out that this \" cancel culture \" within the left is not what its right-wing and liberal critics have claimed. Both have created caricatures of the imaginary power of the left to expel, banish, or punish. But the political intolerance that Garza identifies is hardly an expression of power. Instead, in the absence of real power, left-wing organizing and political communities become the one area where people feel some modicum of control.\n\nIn a country brimming over with racist hate speech and a pervasive rape culture, it is not a cardinal sin to elevate what is politically and socially permissible within movement spaces. But there is a difference between establishing mutually agreed-upon standards of engagement and respect and reinforcing a culture of exclusivity that results in further marginalization. Garza and other organizers are grappling with how to raise a level of accountability while also opening doors to new people who are not schooled in this kind of political culture. They are asking different kinds of questions, such as \"What will it take to expand our ranks and build our movements broadly?\" Phillip Agnew, a former surrogate for Bernie Sanders 's Presidential campaign and an organizer with Black Men Build, describes the approach of his organization in the following way: \"Come as you are, grow as you go.\" That's not cancel culture, that's movement culture.\n\nGarza also takes on the mindless variety of identity politics that often appears within social movements, in which any politics or ideas emanating from those who are racially oppressed or marginalized are assumed to be progressive. Lived experience of oppression does not, alone, constitute radical politics. Indeed, the lived experience of oppression can lead some to draw the worst conclusions about race and gender or the human condition, including the idea that Black people are responsible for their own oppression. Garza celebrates exclusive Black organizing spaces, but she also notes that there are pitfalls to avoid-\"the creation of cliques and uniformity of thought.\" She describes this as a possibility \"when organizers adopt a shallow view of Blackness-Black people as a cool, inherently revolutionary monolith.\" People do not come into the world fully conscious of the ways in which they are oppressed and exploited. If they did, then we would have overturned the disorder of this world a long time ago. As Garza argues, \"These are the activists who wax poetic about Black power but don't acknowledge the impact of generations of exclusion, gaslighting, extraction, disenfranchisement, exploitation, domination, and oppression on Black communities.\" Experiencing oppression is not nearly the same as knowing what to do about it. That comes from history, politics, and, ultimately, organizing.\n\nTwenty-first-century organizing also means getting back to older forms of politics, Garza writes, letting go of the belief that technology and hashtags can organize movements, or the idea that organizations don't matter. In perhaps her sharpest comments, Garza uses the Black Lives Matter activist DeRay Mckesson , whom she describes as a \"social media personality,\" as an example of confusing online influence with having a political base from which to operate. Mckesson, who became known for his Twitter posts during the Ferguson uprising (and for his bright-blue Patagonia vest), eschewed traditional organizing and instead claimed that social media offered protesters the tools to build movements in new ways. In the fury of the Ferguson moment, McKesson argued that individuals were enough to catalyze a movement:\n\nIndividual people can come together around things that they know are unjust. And they can spark change. Your body can be part of the protest; you don't need a VIP pass to protest. . . . I think that what we are doing is building a radical new community in struggle that did not exist before. Twitter has enabled us to create community. I think the phase we're in is a community-building phase. Yes, we need to address policy, yes, we need to address elections; we need to do all those things. But on the heels of building a strong community.\n\nMckesson's disavowal of the traditional ways of organizing was not an abstraction. His response gained traction because he and his political cohort were angered by the efforts of Black liberal organizations and Black elected officials to dictate the outcome of the protests in Ferguson. They were particularly angered by the entry of the Reverends Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, and their criticism of local people who had engaged not only in protests but also in looting, burning, and confrontation with the police. Mckesson and others decided that organizations and in-person meetings were the tropes of this old guard in Black politics, who were much more interested in gatekeeping than in the freedom of young Black people-those who were taking the brunt of tear-gassing and beatings by the police. In this context, Twitter and other social-media platforms seemed new, as did the idea that activists could simply bypass organizations and be the movement themselves.\n\nBut other organizers on the ground in Ferguson-such as Jamala Rogers, of Organization for Black Struggle, and those with Missourians Organizing for Reform and Empowerment-were able to hold on to principled criticisms of the formerly charismatic Black preachers who rolled into Ferguson and the Black elected officials who implored young Black people to get off the streets, while also recognizing that transforming rebellion into lasting change required some level of organization and conventional tools culled from grassroots traditions. As Garza points out, it's easy to misinterpret social-media influence as actual, tangible influence among the broader public. She mentions Mckesson's failed campaign to become mayor of Baltimore, in 2016, based on the illusion that his social media profile, including his then three hundred and thirty thousand followers on Twitter, could be translated into votes. But in the real world of elections, Mckesson captured a dismal 2.6 per cent of the vote in the Democratic primary-fewer than four thousand votes. Garza concludes, \"Hashtags don't build movements. People do.\"\n\nBut she has an even more important argument: we don't have to be beholden to failed models of previous organizing-including relying on top-heavy leadership structures or glorifying men while minimizing the contributions of women-but we can learn from movements past. Garza writes, \"Every successful social movement in history was undergirded by organizations: the suffrage movement, the anti-apartheid movement, the anti-war movement. Even in the age of technology, it is a fallacy to believe that organizations are unimportant or unnecessary.\"\n\nFor Garza, the entire objective of the progressive political enterprise is the pursuit of power. She describes power as \"the ability to make decisions that affect your own life and the lives of others, the freedom to shape and determine the story of who we are. Power also means having the ability to reward and punish and decide how resources are distributed.\" And, for Garza, the road to power passes through electoral campaigns. She is offering a framework for social change that \"requires pressure from the outside, pressure from the inside, and pressure against the structure of the system as a whole.\"\n\nShe is well aware that this view is controversial within the left orbit she travels in. A large part of what is appealing about Garza's book is how honestly and directly she delves into political debates within the B.L.M. movement. In 2016, activists around the movement were not only skeptical of Hillary Clinton but also reluctant to support her campaign. Clinton and her husband had built some portion of their political careers on the backs of poor and working-class Black people. And Hillary Clinton's comments referring to young Black people as \"super predators\" in 1996 had rightly come back to haunt her candidacy in the throes of a movement against police racism and abuse. But, for Garza, the consequence of that reluctance has been the disaster of Trump. She writes, of the left,\n\nWe don't like politicians, and yet it is politicians who represent us and make decisions on our behalf. We don't like how power operates and so we shun power, but we need power in order to transform it. The contradictions themselves are not the problem. The problem lies in not being decisive about how we will impact politics so that we can change our own lives and the lives of millions who are suffering under our indecision.\n\nBut the dilemma is not simply to vote or not to vote. There is a deeper problem, rooted in the electoral choices that the two-party system presents us with. In a conversation we had about her book, Garza explained that, in this past year's Democratic primaries, Joe Biden was not among her top five choices. She said that, during the primaries, \"I had moments of rage because I, like many people, I think, are so through. Tired of being faced with impossible choices, and it's not just in the electoral realm, it's everywhere.\" But, at the same time, she told me, \"I also was very clear that it was an immediate task.\" Last February 20th, Garza and her new organization, Black to the Future Action Fund, endorsed the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren . Warren had strong backing from Black feminists, including Black Womxn For, a group of more than a hundred prominent Black women. Garza tweeted that Warren \"has the best grasp of how race impacts policy and practice, and she has the best plans for addressing those challenges, and including us in the process. We're all in-she provides the best terrain for the fight ahead of us.\"\n\nGarza attributes Biden's primary win to the failures of progressives to unite around a candidate. She then goes further and blames some of Bernie Sanders's supporters for creating \"litmus tests around ideology and labels that were and are largely irrelevant for millions of people who are trying to decide where they are going to place their votes.\" Garza believes that Warren or Sanders should have left the race; given Black to the Future Action Fund's endorsement of Warren, she seems to have placed the burden on Sanders, who was often assumed to be the less electable of the two because he described himself as a socialist. Yet Sanders consistently outperformed Warren throughout the primaries. When Garza's organization endorsed Warren, she was still polling at a distant third or fourth place. It was Sanders who was the front-runner. He ultimately lost after the South Carolina congressman James Clyburn backed Biden, lifting the former Vice-President's campaign from the dustbin of history. In the immediate aftermath of Biden's win over Sanders in South Carolina, the remaining Democratic candidates quickly started exiting the race and closing ranks to support Biden.\n\nSanders's campaign was not undone because he identified as a socialist. Rather, he was unable to generate the new voters his candidacy needed to survive. Of course, this relates to Garza's broader point that candidates and political organizations cannot just drop in on communities every four years and expect to have credibility and legitimacy. Ultimately, Sanders was done in by voters' belief that he could not deliver an agenda that millions of people agreed with in principle. That's not just cynicism: it's the reality of our dysfunctional government, which cannot even produce minimal reforms, let alone transformational change.\n\nGarza would argue that this is why communities must be organized around clear demands and be prepared to withhold their support if the demands are not met. It also might be further evidence that we need more electoral options. The fact that the left perpetually acquiesces to the Democratic candidate is part of the reason that the Democratic Party has moved so far to the right. There is no position that any Democratic politician can take that is so noxious that progressives are morally allowed to refuse the candidate. Instead, they are piously called upon to \"hold the candidate accountable\" while holding their noses over politics they abhor. The problem, of course, is that closing ranks within the Democratic Party has almost always required abandoning the issues that are most important to the left. Even before the final votes in the general election were tallied, the leadership of the Democratic Party began to attack its progressive layer for echoing demands arising from the B.L.M. movement-specifically the demand to defund the police .\n\nSanders's candidacy was hardly one of ideological purity; it was a serious effort to engage in politics on different terms, not as they are but as they could be. His campaigns in 2016 and 2020 found broad support for his central issue, Medicare for All . They undoubtedly helped to transform the national debate concerning health care and debt, reinvigorating ideas that government should spend its enormous resources for public provision. Sanders's ideas had such wide appeal that they shaped the political terrain of the Democratic Party primaries, as candidates raced to demonstrate their progressive credentials. None of this is lost on Garza, but for her the central questions were \"Who can win?\" and \"How does their victory benefit Black communities?\"\n\nIn some ways, Garza's response to the earned cynicism of her activist milieu reflects a kind of pessimism that can take hold when movements fail to break through, for all of the reasons she elaborates in the book. In the first iteration of the B.L.M. movement, a popular chant was derived from a poem written by Assata Shakur in her autobiography : \"It is our duty to fight for our freedom. It is our duty to win.\" But movements don't win just because they are morally superior and righteous in their ambitions. The success or failure of social movements is a test of timing, and of how many, in the balance of social forces, are on one side versus the other. Political experience and organizing prowess can also make a difference, but social change is hard in a country where the most powerful forces are committed to maintaining the status quo. The lack of a breakthrough can be demoralizing, and it can lead activists to conclude that other methods may be more fruitful in obtaining the outcome they have dedicated so much to securing.\n\nIn this country, that has often meant turning to electoral politics to win the elusive goals of justice and greater democratic inclusion. Many of the activists of the Black movement of the sixties transitioned into electoral politics, giving rise to a new heyday of Black mayors and other elected officials, which eventually created the conditions for the political career of Barack Obama. But the resumption of Black activism and rebellion that led to Black Lives Matter was, at least in part, a reaction to the failure of the turn to politics to improve the lives of people in poor and working-class Black communities. Why should we expect a different outcome this time around?\n\nGarza writes that during the 2016 election, three years into her organizing around the call that Black lives matter, \"what we learned was that protest is not enough to shift politics as much as we need them to shift. This is the work of governance.\" But transforming the lives of Black people and, really, all poor and working-class people in the United States requires more than governance. As Garza suggests, it requires a massive redistribution of wealth-and that will require extraordinary political pressure generated through protest and social movements.\n\nThe difficulty that the movement continues to encounter is exactly what Martin Luther King, Jr., confronted when he turned his attention to fighting racism in America's northern ghettos. He understood that repelling Jim Crow was relatively cheap in the world of politics-by changing the laws, American apartheid could disappear. But changing the conditions wrought by American racism-including poverty, substandard and segregated housing, under-resourced schools, health disparities, and the entrenched racism of American police and the criminal-justice system-would require the wholesale redistribution of wealth and resources in the United States. It would require what King described as a \"radical reconstruction\" of American society. This realization compelled King to call for massive civil disobedience in Washington, D.C., as part of the unrealized Poor People's Campaign, which was cut short by his assassination in April of 1968.\n\nGarza writes sparingly about capitalism, even though it has evidently helped to constitute much of the misery that she has spent her adult life organizing against. Her attention is mostly trained on the day-to-day crises that capitalism creates in the lives of ordinary people. That is the important work that social reforms can attend to today. But there are looming systemic crises that most of our elections barely touch, and that require more than the acquisition of political control or governing capability to fully address. The global pandemic is only the most recent evidence that the crises we face as a species are existential. While climate change is the most dramatic evidence of this fact, there is also the spectre of chronic insecurity in obtaining food, housing, health care, and even income-which also poses threats to humanity. This reality raises the bar for what should be expected of politics-the strategies and tactics necessary to change the world, not just elections.\n\nGarza identifies what she sees as the limits of protests, but it is the massive outpouring of protests that erupted over the summer which played a critical role in shifting the consciousness and expectations of millions of Americans. It is also obvious that protests alone are not enough. Of all the elected officials and corporate executives who took to saying \"Black Lives Matter\" over the summer, very few have followed through with tangible reforms. Garza would say that the lack of a clear Black agenda, along with deep organizing to make it legible politically, has allowed elected officials to willfully ignore demands emanating from Black communities. What we should learn from the latest iteration of the B.L.M. movement is that we need more organization, not less, and that we need clearer points of entry into such organizations for those who wish to do more than just demonstrate. But building successful movements is not just about formulas; it is also about allowing oneself to have what the historian Robin D. G. Kelley describes as \"freedom dreams,\" to envisage an altogether different world.\n\nThis doesn't mean that electoral politics don't matter. We have to struggle for what can be obtained and make life better today. But, as Garza writes:\n\nMaking America great is ensuring that America remembers that each of us is but a tiny speck on this planet who must learn how to coexist in ways that allow others to live well too. Making America great is making right all that has been done wrong in the name of progress and profit. And at its core, making America great is a commitment to ensuring that everyone can have a good life.\n\nThese are tasks that take us beyond what our political system is organized to deliver. Nothing short of mass movements to uproot, overturn, and radically reconstruct can produce the new America envisioned here. Garza's excellent and provocative new book is a gateway to these urgent debates.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "How Black Lives Matter Is Changing the Church\n\nOne December evening, in 2014, Brenda Salter McNeil, a pastor and Black evangelical leader, descended into a church basement in Ferguson, Missouri, to meet with young activists from a broad-based group called Ferguson Action. In the four months since Michael Brown, a local eighteen-year-old, had been fatally shot by Darren Wilson, a police officer, Ferguson had become the national center of protest against police violence and the proving ground for the new Black Lives Matter movement; some of the activists running Ferguson Action went on to lead the B.L.M. movement nationwide. Salter McNeil, who is in her fifties and wears thick-rimmed glasses, had come with a handful of other evangelical leaders on a pilgrimage sponsored by Sojourners, a progressive evangelical organization, to ask the activists what role the church should take in addressing police brutality against people of color.\n\nSeveral of the religious leaders who came that day were proponents of a church movement called racial reconciliation, which seeks to end racism by addressing it as a sin in individuals that can be eradicated through Biblical study, confession, and prayer. Salter McNeil-who became  Christian at the age of nineteen and went on to receive a master-of-divinity degree at Fuller Theological Seminary, where she began to identify as evangelical-was one of the most prominent figures in the racial-reconciliation movement. For the previous thirty years, she had touted reconciliation around the world, often addressing tens of thousands of listeners, mostly conservative white evangelicals, at conferences and megachurches. When she spoke, she explicitly avoided talking about aspects of structural racism, such as the racial wealth gap, or the high death rate of Black mothers during childbirth; she sought to insure that her sermons were rooted in the Bible and not, as she saw it, in politics. She also stayed away from topics such as sexuality and abortion, for fear that she'd be labelled a liberal with a hidden agenda. Her workshops focussed on inspiring personal stories but left listeners with few practical tools to root out racism in their communities.\n\nTo the young activists in Ferguson, the church's failure to address systemic racial injustice in the United States rendered American Christian leaders like Salter McNeil part of the problem. In addition, they took issue with what they saw as the church's culture of homophobia and misogyny. That evening, when Salter McNeil and others asked the activists how the church could support them, the young activists expressed their rage. \"They told us that they hated the church's misogyny and hypocrisy, and how we treated L.G.B.T.Q. people,\" Salter McNeil told me recently. \"They said, 'It seems like you work harder to keep people out of the church than to let them in.' \" The more she listened, the more Salter McNeil began to think that the activists had a point. \"It was that night that I really understood how disappointed young people of color had become with the church. They experienced us as not simply irrelevant but on the wrong side of justice.\" The next day, the activists sent a text to the evangelical leaders. \"We are meeting on the steps of the municipal court building at 4 P.M. Are you coming or not?\" it read.\n\n\"The message was put up or shut up,\" Salter McNeil said. Although she was accustomed to preaching before thousands of listeners, she was terrified to take part in a street protest: she worried that she would get trapped in a crowd and attacked by the police. She didn't know the basics of preparing for such an endeavor: that, for example, she was supposed to carry a driver's license in case she was arrested, to scrawl the number of an emergency contact on her arm, and to have a cloth mask to cover her face in case the police shot canisters of tear gas. She decided to attend anyway. When she arrived at the courthouse, she was startled by the diversity of her fellow-protesters. She saw older white Mennonites dressed in bonnets holding a white sheet that said \"Black Lives Matter.\"\n\nThe police had put up barricades to stop the protesters from reaching the courthouse steps, and some of the protesters began to shake them, trying to pull them down. Salter McNeil watched as a young white protester with spiky hair rushed ahead and climbed the fence. \"I thought, This little white guy is going to cause the police to react, and they're going to react with violence against us Black people,\" she said. Overwhelmed with terror, she knelt in the street and began to pray as the swirl of bodies pressed around her. One by one, although she didn't notice, the other faith leaders knelt nearby, and so did some of the young activists who, the night before, had expressed disgust with the church's failure to take a meaningful stand for Black lives. McNeil told me that, in that moment, she felt the nearness of God in a way that she never had from the pulpit or stage. \"It changed my life,\" she said. \"That day, Jesus came into the neighborhood.\"\n\nSalter McNeil is one of a growing number of leaders in both evangelical and mainstream churches for whom Black Lives Matter has prompted a crisis of moral conscience. \"What Black Lives Matter did was highlight the racism and white supremacy that still has a stranglehold on much of white Christianity,\" Jemar Tisby, a prominent church historian and the author of \" The Color of Compromise ,\" told me. \"You have this phrase and this movement that is forcing people, essentially, to take sides.\" In her new book, \" Becoming Brave ,\" which came out in August, Salter McNeil writes, \"I began my journey sincerely believing that if I could convince evangelical Christians that reconciliation was not some politically motivated agenda but a Biblical calling rooted in Scripture, they would pursue racial justice.\" She now believes that this has proven naïve, and that religious leaders must begin more actively campaigning against systemic racism if they are to effect change.\n\nBlack Lives Matter has created this reckoning in part by prompting a backlash against the racial-reconciliation movement, which has held sway in evangelical circles since the nineteen-nineties. In 1996, Bill McCartney, a former football coach and the founder of Promise Keepers, an influential evangelical men's organization, helped to launch a wide-scale effort to \"disciple\" a million men in the project of undoing racism through Biblical teachings. The project was idealistic: in 1997, as Chanequa Walker-Barnes writes, in \" I Bring the Voices of My People ,\" the organization \"declared a lofty goal of eradicating racism in the church by 2000.\" At its inception, the movement's aims were intensely practical: it funded efforts to rebuild Black churches targeted by arson, agitated for the hiring of more racially diverse staff in evangelical organizations, and developed curricula around racism. But early efforts to spur broader policy changes fizzled. At the Promise Keepers conference in 1996, when conversation turned to practical ways of dismantling racism through programs like affirmative action, white evangelicals became upset and derailed the discussion. As McCartney told the authors of the book \" Divided by Faith ,\" \"Of the 1996 conference participants who had a complaint, nearly 40 percent reacted negatively to the reconciliation theme.\"\n\nOver the next two decades, racial reconciliation moved away from efforts to combat institutional racism and focussed instead on addressing personal feelings about race. This focus sits more easily with the theological underpinnings of evangelical Christianity, which emphasize a believer's personal relationship with Jesus and portray sin and salvation as matters of personal choice. Today, the reconciliation movement centers around gimmicky one-off events, like pulpit-swaps, in which Black and white pastors switch congregations. Conversations abound race are reduced to \"relational\" confessionals, often one-sided chats in which white Christians share the ways in which they've committed the sins of racism, and Christians of color are cast in the role of confessors, required to hear and then to absolve their white counterparts. Subjects such as mass-incarceration or economic inequity are written off as outside the purview of the Bible and tainted by politics.\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement has pushed the church toward a more urgent confrontation with racism. Austin Channing Brown, the author of \" I'm Still Here ,\" a memoir about her childhood as a Black girl in a white church, told me, \"Black Lives Matter has forced the church to move beyond an easy rhetoric of 'togetherness.' \" Salter McNeil put it more bluntly. \"People are sick of the kumbaya party,\" she told me. \"The idea is that if we can sing in Spanish and eat with chopsticks, we are somehow reconciled. But young people know that's hollow.\" The problem, as they see it, is that racism is often a function not of personal malice but of the way systems are built: white people can profess love for racial minorities, but if their school system remains segregated as a result of decades of policy that benefit those in power, Black people will remain disenfranchised. \"If you still support policies that cage up children, or that cause people of color to die of COVID -19, that's not reconciliation.\" she said. \"It's a smokescreen for racism, and you're not going to put my face on your pamphlet.\"\n\nSalter McNeil told me that, for decades, she didn't talk about racist policies, because she thought it would make her seem overly partisan. Now she sees these issues as beyond squabbles between Republicans and Democrats. \"Partisanship is what party you choose,\" she said. \"Politics is about the policy that impacts people's lives, and we should all be talking about that.\" She finds inspiration in the Biblical scenes that depict Jesus as a radical figure-a man of color-flipping tables in the temple to point out economic injustice and agitating for the dignified treatment of lepers and prostitutes. Christ sought to upend corrupt social hierarchies, not to reinforce them or to look the other way; Salter McNeil now sees this as the heart of her own work.\n\nOthers have called upon the church to examine its own history of racism. In 2014, Jennifer Harvey wrote a book called \" Dear White Christians ,\" which argued that racism has pervaded the white church in America since the days of slavery. In 2015, Michelle Higgins, a Black pastor and organizer, stood up before tens of thousands of people at a popular evangelical conference in St Louis, Missouri, and told them that, as she put it to me, \"mission work was really an exercise in exporting racism, and that evangelicalism was a moral protection for white supremacy.\" The backlash against Higgins was swift: by the next morning, she'd received numerous death threats. Today, her criticisms are gaining ground. \"For the last five hundred years, Christianity has been influenced by Martin Luther's effort to decentralize the church,\" Lisa Sharon Harper, the founder of a progressive evangelical religious group called Freedom Road, told me. \"For the next five hundred years, the principle effort will be decolonization.\"\n\nSince the killing of George Floyd , Salter McNeil has been busy agitating against police violence and speaking about the role that Christians can play in ending injustice. Before the pandemic, she might have addressed her listeners in person. Today, her audience is largely virtual: she speaks on podcasts, and preaches at Quest and Cornerstone, evangelical megachurches where she works as a pastor, via Zoom. She often critiques the shortcomings of reconciliation, as she and others have practiced it. On a recent episode of the podcast \"Churchleaders,\" she prayed aloud with the host.\"These children are in these streets around the world saying 'Black Lives Matter,' because they can see the hypocrisy and the disparity in how one group of people are treated by police,\" she said. \"Let's stop making excuses.\"\n\nThere are some indications that these new leaders are gaining ground in religious communities. Lisa Sharon Harper has gained tens of thousands of followers on social media. Austin Channing Brown's book was added to Reese Witherspoon's book club; and Jemar Tisby's book, which was published in 2019, recently hit the Times best-seller list. Some conservative churches are also beginning to engage with movements for social justice. \"Black Lives Matter has forced Christians to do some actual social-change work,\" Drew Hart, a professor at Messiah University and the author of \" Trouble I've Seen ,\" told me. Recently, in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where Hart lives, Pentecostals and evangelicals hosted rallies against racial injustice, an effort that was unprecedented for the community. Despite considerable blowback, InterVarsity, a campus evangelical organization, has supported Black Lives Matter since 2015. \"The example of Jesus' life and work among the dispossessed, and his call for radical equality, serves as a blueprint for taking apart unjust systems,\" Hart told me. \"The gospel is actually powerful enough to transform our society if we take Jesus seriously.\"\n\nOf course, not everyone is listening. Recently, on Facebook, a white man chided Salter McNeil, writing to her that people liked her better when she didn't speak about social justice and just quoted Bible verses. \"Did it hurt? Yep, it did. I deleted him,\" she told me. \"But he made a telling statement. What white-dominant culture has said is that if you would just show us it's in the Bible, if you wouldn't be angry, if you wouldn't bring up politics, we'll listen,\" she went on. \"Most of us said, O.K., I hear that you don't want the Angry Black Woman. If we could be intellectual enough, Biblical enough, gracious enough-if we could do it in a way that didn't make white people feel guilty and shamed, then things would change,\" she told me. \"My sister, that just isn't true.\"\n\nIn her workshops, Salter McNeil still encourages participants to try to reduce racial prejudice in their own hearts, and she believes that the church offers helpful spiritual tools in this regard: confession allows an individual to recognize the harm he has caused through racism; lament creates a space for grieving that harm; repentance is a means to undo the harm in practical ways. Now, however, Salter McNeil also speaks out against U.S. policies that she sees as racist-for example, the cruel treatment of undocumented immigrants in detention, or policies that are causing people of color to die of COVID -19 at a higher rate than whites. She turns down speaking engagements when she fears that she will simply be used as a token Black presence, but won't really be heard. When I spoke to her, in July, she had just declined an invitation to speak about race to a group of wealthy, white Christians in Florida, who she feared just wanted a person of color to headline their event. \"When I say 'Black Lives Matter,' and they respond, 'Don't All Lives Matter?' there's someone to answer their question, but it isn't me any longer,\" she said. \"I don't want to answer questions that I've answered for the past thirty years, nor will I. The time is way more urgent.\"\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Sunday Reading: A Year of New Urgency for Black Lives Matter\n\nIn 2016, Jelani Cobb published a sweeping report in The New Yorker about a new movement that had emerged in the wake of Michael Brown's killing by a police officer, in Ferguson, Missouri, and the massacre at Emanuel A.M.E. Church, in Charleston, South Carolina, among other events. Black Lives Matter had become a powerful rallying cry for a new generation of civil-rights activists, and, for some in the movement, the affirmation was \"as much a reminder directed at black people as it is a revelation aimed at whites,\" Cobb wrote. In 2020, the phrase and movement took on new life as millions of people from all different backgrounds mobilized across the globe to protest the killing of George Floyd.\n\nSign up for Classics, a twice-weekly newsletter featuring notable pieces from the past.\n\nThis week, we're bringing you a selection of pieces about the evolution of Black Lives Matter and the racial-justice movement in America.

      "text": "The Matter of Black Lives\n\nOn February 18th, as part of the official recognition of Black History Month, President Obama met with a group of African-American leaders at the White House to discuss civil-rights issues. The guests-who included Representative John Lewis , of Georgia; Sherrilyn Ifill, the director-counsel of the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense and Educational Fund; and Wade Henderson, who heads the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights-were intent on pressing the President to act decisively on criminal-justice issues during his last year in office. Their urgency, though, was tempered by a degree of sentimentality, verging on nostalgia. As Ifill later told me, \"We were very much aware that this was the last Black History Month of this Presidency.\"\n\nBut the meeting was also billed as the \"first of its kind,\" in that it would bring together different generations of activists. To that end, the White House had invited DeRay Mckesson, Brittany Packnett, and Aislinn Pulley, all of whom are prominent figures in Black Lives Matter, which had come into existence-amid the flash points of the George Zimmerman trial; Michael Brown's death, in Ferguson, Missouri; and the massacre at the Emanuel A.M.E. Church, in Charleston, South Carolina-during Obama's second term.\n\nPublished in the print edition of the March 14, 2016 , issue.\n\nBlack Lives Matter has been described as \"not your grandfather's civil-rights movement,\" to distinguish its tactics and its philosophy from those of nineteen-sixties-style activism. Like the Occupy movement, it eschews hierarchy and centralized leadership, and its members have not infrequently been at odds with older civil-rights leaders and with the Obama Administration-as well as with one another. So it wasn't entirely surprising when Pulley, a community organizer in Chicago, declined the White House invitation, on the ground that the meeting was nothing more than a \"photo opportunity\" for the President. She posted a statement online in which she said that she \"could not, with any integrity, participate in such a sham that would only serve to legitimize the false narrative that the government is working to end police brutality and the institutional racism that fuels it.\" Her skepticism was attributable, in part, to the fact that she lives and works in a city whose mayor, Rahm Emanuel, Obama's former chief of staff, is embroiled in a controversy stemming from a yearlong coverup of the fatal shooting by police of an African-American teen-ager.\n\nMckesson, a full-time activist, and Packnett, the executive director of Teach for America in St. Louis, did accept the invitation, and they later described the meeting as constructive. Mckesson tweeted: \"Why did I go to the mtg w/ @ POTUS today? B/c there are things we can do now to make folks' lives better today, tomorrow, & the day after.\" Two weeks earlier, Mckesson had announced that he would be a candidate in the Baltimore mayoral race, and Obama's praise, after the meeting, for his \"outstanding work mobilizing in Baltimore\" was, if not an endorsement, certainly politically valuable.\n\nThat split in the response to the White House, however, reflected a larger conflict: while Black Lives Matter's insistent outsider status has allowed it to shape the dialogue surrounding race and criminal justice in this country, it has also sparked a debate about the limits of protest, particularly of online activism. Meanwhile, internal disputes have raised questions about what the movement hopes to achieve, and about its prospects for success.\n\nThe phrase \"black lives matter\" was born in July of 2013, in a Facebook post by Alicia Garza, called \"a love letter to black people.\" The post was intended as an affirmation for a community distraught over George Zimmerman's acquittal in the shooting death of seventeen-year-old Trayvon Martin, in Sanford, Florida. Garza, now thirty-five, is the special-projects director in the Oakland office of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, which represents twenty thousand caregivers and housekeepers, and lobbies for labor legislation on their behalf. She is also an advocate for queer and transgender rights and for anti-police-brutality campaigns.\n\nGarza has a prodigious social-media presence, and on the day that the Zimmerman verdict was handed down she posted, \"the sad part is, there's a section of America who is cheering and celebrating right now. and that makes me sick to my stomach. we GOTTA get it together y'all.\" Later, she added, \"btw stop saying we are not surprised. that's a damn shame in itself. I continue to be surprised at how little Black lives matter. And I will continue that. stop giving up on black life.\" She ended with \"black people. I love you. I love us. Our lives matter.\"\n\nGarza's friend Patrisse Cullors amended the last three words to create a hashtag: #BlackLivesMatter. Garza sometimes writes haiku-she admires the economy of the form-and in those four syllables she recognized a distillation not only of the anger that attended Zimmerman's acquittal but also of the animating principle at the core of black social movements dating back more than a century.\n\nGarza grew up as Alicia Schwartz, in Marin County, where she was raised by her African-American mother and her Jewish stepfather, who run an antiques store. Her brother Joey, who works for the family business, is almost young enough to have been Trayvon Martin's peer. That is one reason, she says, that the Zimmerman verdict affected her so deeply. The family was not particularly political, but Garza showed an interest in activism in middle school, when she worked to have information about contraception made available to students in Bay Area schools.\n\nShe went on to study anthropology and sociology at the University of California, San Diego. When she was twenty-three, she told her family that she was queer. They reacted to the news with equanimity. \"I think it helped that my parents are an interracial couple,\" she told me. \"Even if they didn't fully understand what it meant, they were supportive.\" For a few years, Garza held various jobs in the social-justice sector. She found the work fulfilling, but, she said, \"San Francisco broke my heart over and over. White progressives would actually argue with us about their right to determine what was best for communities they never had to live in.\"\n\nIn 2003, she met Malachi Garza, a gregarious, twenty-four-year-old trans male activist, who ran training sessions for organizers. They married five years later. In 2009, early on the morning of New Year's Day, a transit-police officer named Johannes Mehserle fatally shot Oscar Grant, a twenty-two-year-old African-American man, in the Fruitvale BART station, in Oakland, three blocks from where the Garzas live. Alicia was involved in a fight for fair housing in San Francisco at the time, but Malachi, who was by then the director of the Community Justice Network for Youth, immersed himself in a campaign to have Mehserle brought up on murder charges. (He was eventually convicted of involuntary manslaughter, and served one year of a two-year sentence.)\n\nGrant died nineteen days before Barack Obama's first Inauguration. (The film \"Fruitvale Station,\" a dramatic recounting of the last day of Grant's life, contrasts his death with the national exuberance following the election.) His killing was widely seen as a kind of political counterpoint-a reminder that the grip of history would not be easily broken.\n\nGarza had met Patrisse Cullors in 2005, on a dance floor in Providence, Rhode Island, where they were both attending an organizers' conference. Cullors, a native of Los Angeles, had been organizing in the L.G.B.T.Q. community since she was a teen-ager-she came out as queer when she was sixteen and was forced to leave home-and she had earned a degree in religion and philosophy at U.C.L.A. She is now a special-projects director at the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights, in Oakland, which focusses on social justice in inner cities. Garza calls Cullors her \"twin.\" After Cullors created the Black Lives Matter hashtag, the two women began promoting it. Opal Tometi , a writer and an immigration-rights organizer in Brooklyn, whom Garza had met at a conference in 2012, offered to build a social-media platform, on Facebook and Twitter, where activists could connect with one another. The women also began thinking about how to turn the phrase into a movement.\n\nBlack Lives Matter didn't reach a wider public until the following summer, when a police officer named Darren Wilson shot and killed eighteen-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson. Darnell Moore, a writer and an activist based in Brooklyn, who knew Cullors, coördinated \"freedom rides\" to Missouri from New York, Chicago, Portland, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and Boston. Within a few weeks of Brown's death, hundreds of people who had never participated in organized protests took to the streets, and that campaign eventually exposed Ferguson as a case study of structural racism in America and a metaphor for all that had gone wrong since the end of the civil-rights movement.\n\nDeRay Mckesson, who was twenty-nine at the time and working as an administrator in the Minneapolis public-school system, watched as responses to Brown's death rolled through his Twitter feed, and decided to drive the six hundred miles to Ferguson to witness the scene himself. Before he left, he posted a request for housing on Facebook. Teach for America's Brittany Packnett helped him find a place; before moving to Minneapolis, he had taught sixth-grade math as a T.F.A. employee in Brooklyn. Soon after his arrival, he attended a street-medic training session, where he met Johnetta Elzie, a twenty-five-year-old St. Louis native. With Packnett, they began sharing information about events and tweeting updates from demonstrations, and they quickly became the most recognizable figures associated with the movement in Ferguson. For their efforts, he and Elzie received the Howard Zinn Freedom to Write Award, in 2015, and Packnett was appointed to the President's Commission on Twenty-first Century Policing.\n\nYet, although the three of them are among the most identifiable names associated with the Black Lives Matter movement, none of them officially belong to a chapter of the organization. Elzie, in fact, takes issue with people referring to Garza, Cullors, and Tometi as founders. As she sees it, Ferguson is the cradle of the movement, and no chapter of the organization exists there or anywhere in the greater St. Louis area. That contentious distinction between the organization and the movement is part of the debate about what Black Lives Matter is and where it will go next.\n\nThe central contradiction of the civil-rights movement was that it was a quest for democracy led by organizations that frequently failed to function democratically. W. E. B. Du Bois , in his 1903 essay \"The Talented Tenth,\" wrote that \"the Negro race, like all races, is going to be saved by its exceptional men,\" and the traditional narrative of the battle for the rights of African-Americans has tended to read like a great-black-man theory of history. But, starting a generation ago, civil-rights historians concluded that their field had focussed too heavily on the movement's leaders. New scholarship began charting the contributions of women, local activists, and small organizations-the lesser-known elements that enabled the grand moments we associate with the civil-rights era. In particular, the career of Ella Baker, who was a director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and who oversaw the founding of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, came to be seen as a counter-model to the careers of leaders like Martin Luther King, Jr. Baker was emphatically averse to the spotlight. Barbara Ransby, a professor of history and gender studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago, who wrote a biography of Baker, told me that, during the nineteen-forties, when Baker was a director of branches for the N.A.A.C.P., \"she would go into small towns and say, 'Whom are you reaching out to?' And she'd tell them that if you're not reaching out to the town drunk you're not really working for the rights of black people. The folk who were getting rounded up and thrown in jail had to be included.\"\n\nCullors says, \"The consequence of focussing on a leader is that you develop a necessity for that leader to be the one who's the spokesperson and the organizer, who tells the masses where to go, rather than the masses understanding that we can catalyze a movement in our own community.\" Or, as Garza put it, \"The model of the black preacher leading people to the promised land isn't working right now.\" Jesse Jackson-a former aide to King and a two-time Presidential candidate, who won seven primaries and four caucuses in 1988-was booed when he tried to address young protesters in Ferguson, who saw him as an interloper. That response was seen as indicative of a generational divide. But the divide was as much philosophical as it was generational, and one that was visible half a century earlier.\n\nGarza, Cullors, and Tometi advocate a horizontal ethic of organizing, which favors democratic inclusion at the grassroots level. Black Lives Matter emerged as a modern extension of Ella Baker's thinking-a preference for ten thousand candles rather than a single spotlight. In a way, they created the context and the movement created itself. \"Really, the genesis of the organization was the people who organized in their cities for the ride to Ferguson,\" Garza told me in her office. Those people, she said, \"pushed us to create a chapter structure. They wanted to continue to do this work together, and be connected to activists and organizers from across the country.\" There are now more than thirty Black Lives Matter chapters in the United States, and one in Toronto. They vary in structure and emphasis, and operate with a great deal of latitude, particularly when it comes to choosing what \"actions\" to stage. But prospective chapters must submit to a rigorous assessment, by a coördinator, of the kinds of activism that members have previously engaged in, and they must commit to the organization's guiding principles. These are laid out in a thirteen-point statement written by the women and Darnell Moore, which calls for, in part, an ideal of unapologetic blackness. \"In affirming that black lives matter, we need not qualify our position,\" the statement reads.\n\nYet, although the movement initially addressed the killing of unarmed young black men, the women were equally committed to the rights of working people and to gender and sexual equality. So the statement also espouses inclusivity, because \"to love and desire freedom and justice for ourselves is a necessary prerequisite for wanting the same for others.\" Garza's argument for inclusivity is informed by the fact that she-a black queer female married to a trans male-would likely have found herself marginalized not only in the society she hopes to change but also in many of the organizations that are dedicated to changing it. She also dismisses the kind of liberalism that finds honor in nonchalance. \"We want to make sure that people are not saying, 'Well, whatever you are, I don't care,' \" she said. \"No, I want you to care. I want you to see all of me.\"\n\nBlack activists have organized in response to police brutality for decades, but part of the reason for the visibility of the current movement is the fact that such problems have persisted-and, from the public's perspective, at least, have seemed to escalate-during the first African-American Presidency. Obama's election was seen as the culmination of years of grassroots activism that built the political power of black Americans, but the naïve dream of a post-racial nation foundered even before he was sworn into office. As Garza put it, \"Conditions have shifted, so our institutions have shifted to meet those conditions. Barack Obama comes out after Trayvon is murdered and does this weird, half-ass thing where he's, like, 'That could've been my son,' and at the same time he starts scolding young black men.\" In short, all this would seem to suggest, until there was a black Presidency it was impossible to conceive of the limitations of one. Obama, as a young community organizer in Chicago, determined that he could bring about change more effectively through electoral politics; Garza is of a generation of activists who have surveyed the circumstances of his Presidency and drawn the opposite conclusion.\n\nI met up with Garza in downtown San Francisco last August, on an afternoon when the icy winds felt like a rebuke to summer. A lively crowd of several hundred people had gathered in United Nations Plaza for Trans Liberation Tuesday, an event that was being held in twenty cities across the country. A transgender opera singer sang \"Amazing Grace.\" Then Janetta Johnson, a black trans activist, said, \"We've been in the street for Oscar Grant, for Trayvon Martin, for Eric Garner. It's time for our community to show up for trans women.\"\n\nThe names of Grant, Martin, and Garner-who died in 2014, after being put in a choke hold by police on Staten Island-are now part of the canon of the wrongfully dead. The point of Trans Liberation Tuesday was to draw attention to the fact that there are others, such as Ashton O'Hara and Amber Monroe, black trans people who were killed just weeks apart in Detroit last year, whose names may not be known to the public but who are no less emblematic of a broader social concern. According to a report by the Human Rights Campaign, between 2013 and 2015 there were fifty-three known murders of transgender people; thirty-nine of the victims were African-American.\n\nGarza addressed the crowd for just four minutes; she is not given to soaring rhetoric, but speaks with clarity and confidence. She began with a roll call of the underrepresented: \"We understand that, in our communities, black trans folk, gender-nonconforming folk, black queer folk, black women, black disabled folk-we have been leading movements for a long time, but we have been erased from the official narrative.\" Yet, over all, her comments were more concerned with the internal dynamics of race. For Garza, the assurance that black lives matter is as much a reminder directed at black people as it is a revelation aimed at whites. The message of Trans Liberation Tuesday was that, as society at large has devalued black lives, the African-American community is guilty of devaluing lives based on gender and sexuality.\n\nThe kind of ecumenical activism that Garza espouses has deep roots in the Bay Area. In 1966, in Oakland, Huey P. Newton co-founded the Black Panther Party, which was practically defined by hyperbolic masculinity. Four years later, he made a statement whose message was, at the time, rare for the left, not to mention the broader culture. In a Party newsletter, he wrote:\n\nWe have not said much about the homosexual at all, but we must relate to the homosexual movement because it is a real thing. And I know through reading, and through my life experience and observations, that homosexuals are not given freedom and liberty by anyone in the society. They might be the most oppressed people in the society.\n\nThe movement remained steadfastly masculinist, but by the nineteen-eighties Newton's words had begun to appear prescient. When I asked Garza about the most common misperception of Black Lives Matter, she pointed to a frequent social-media dig that it is \"a gay movement masquerading as a black one.\" But the organization's fundamental point has been to challenge the assumption that those two things are mutually exclusive. In 1989, the race-theory and legal scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw introduced the principle of \"intersectionality,\" by which multiple identities coexist and complicate the ways in which we typically think of class, race, gender, and sexuality as social problems. \"Our work is heavily influenced by Crenshaw's theory,\" Garza told me. \"People think that we're engaged with identity politics. The truth is that we're doing what the labor movement has always done-organizing people who are at the bottom.\"\n\nAs was the case during the civil-rights movement, there are no neat distinctions between the activities of formal organizations and those incited by an atmosphere of social unrest. That ambiguity can be an asset when it inspires entry-level activism among people who had never attended a protest, as happened in Ferguson. But it can be a serious liability when actions contrary to the principles of the movement are associated with it. In December, 2014, video surfaced of a march in New York City, called in response to the deaths of Eric Garner and others, where some protesters chanted that they wanted to see \"dead cops.\" The event was part of the Millions March, which was led by a coalition of organizations, but the chant was attributed to Black Lives Matter. Several months later, the footage provoked controversy. \"For four weeks, Bill O'Reilly was flashing my picture on the screen and saying we're a hate group,\" Garza said.\n\nA week after the march, a troubled drifter named Ismaaiyl Brinsley fatally shot two New York City police officers, Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, as they sat in their patrol car, before killing himself. Some observers argued that, although Brinsley had not identified with any group, his actions were the result of an anti-police climate created by Black Lives Matter. Last summer, not long after Dylann Roof killed nine African-Americans at the Emanuel A.M.E. Church, South Carolina's governor, Nikki Haley, implied that the movement had so intimidated police officers that they were unable to do their jobs, thereby putting more black lives at risk. All of this was accompanied by an increasing skepticism, across the political spectrum, about whether Black Lives Matter could move beyond reacting to outrages and begin proactively shaping public policy.\n\nThe current Presidential campaign has presented the movement with a crucial opportunity to address that question. Last summer, at the annual Netroots Nation conference of progressive activists, in Phoenix, Martin O'Malley made his candidacy a slightly longer shot when he responded to a comment about Black Lives Matter by asserting that all lives matter-an evasion of the specificity of black concerns, which elicited a chorus of boos. At the same event, activists interrupted Bernie Sanders . The Sanders campaign made overtures to the movement following the incident, but three weeks later, on the eve of the first anniversary of Michael Brown's death, two protesters identifying themselves as Black Lives Matter activists-Marissa Johnson and Mara Willaford-disrupted a Sanders rally in Seattle, preventing the Senator from addressing several thousand people who had gathered to hear him. The women were booed by the largely white crowd, but the dissent wasn't limited to whites. This was the kind of freestyle disruption that caused even some African-Americans to wonder how the movement was choosing its targets. At the time, it did seem odd to have gone after Sanders twice, given that he is the most progressive candidate in the race, and that none of the Republican candidates had been disrupted in their campaigns.\n\nGarza argues that the strategy has been to leverage influence among the Democrats, since ninety per cent of African-Americans vote Democratic. She says that it will be uncomfortable for voters if \"the person that you are supporting hasn't actually done what they need to be doing, in terms of addressing the real concern of people under this broad banner.\" She defended the Seattle action, saying that it was \"part of a very localized dynamic, but an important one,\" and added that \"without being disrupted Sanders wouldn't have released a platform on racial justice.\" Afterward, Sanders hired Symone Sanders, an African-American woman, to be his national press secretary. He also released a statement on civil rights that prominently featured the names of African-American victims of police violence, and he began frequently referring to Black Lives Matter on the campaign trail. He subsequently won the support of many younger black activists, including Eric Garner's daughter.\n\nAn attempt to disrupt a Hillary Clinton rally early in the campaign, in New Hampshire, failed when the protesters arrived too late to get into the hall. But Clinton met with them privately afterward, and engaged in a debate about mass incarceration. She has met with members of the movement on other occasions, too. Clinton has the support of older generations of black leaders and activists-including Eric Garner's mother-and she decisively carried the black vote in Super Tuesday primaries across the South. But she has been repeatedly criticized by other activists for her support of President Bill Clinton's 1994 crime bill, and, particularly, for comments that she made, in the nineties, about \"superpredators\" and the need \"to bring them to heel.\" Two weeks ago, Ashley Williams, a twenty-three-year-old who describes herself as an \"independent organizer for the movement for black lives,\" interrupted a private fund-raising event in Charleston, where Clinton was speaking, to demand an apology. The next day, Clinton told the Washington Post , \"Looking back, I shouldn't have used those words, and I wouldn't use them today.\"\n\nIf Black Lives Matter has been an object lesson in the power of social media, it has also revealed the medium's pitfalls. Just as the movement was enjoying newfound influence among the Democratic Presidential contenders, it was also gaining attention for a series of febrile Twitter exchanges. In one, DeRay Mckesson and Johnetta Elzie got into a dispute with Shaun King, a writer for the Daily News , over fund-raising for a social-justice group. The conservative Web site Breitbart ran a picture of Mckesson and King with the headline \" BLACK LIVES MATTER LEADERS JUST EXCOMMUNICATED SHAUN KING .\"\n\nLast month, it was announced that Garza would speak at Webster University, in St. Louis, which prompted an acrimonious social-media response from people in the area who are caught up in the debate over the movement's origins. Elzie tweeted, \"Thousands of ppl without platforms who have NO CLUE who the 'three' are, and their work/sacrifice gets erased,\" and said that the idea that Garza is a founder of the movement is a \"lie.\" Garza released a statement saying that she had cancelled the event \"due to threats and online attacks on our organization and us as individuals from local activists with whom we have made an effort to have meaningful dialogue.\" She continued, \"We all lose when bullying and personal attacks become a substitute for genuine conversation and principled disagreement.\"\n\nThere's nothing novel about personality conflicts arising among activists, but to older organizers, who had watched as federal surveillance and infiltration programs sowed discord that all but wrecked the Black Power movement, the public airing of grievances seemed particularly amateurish. \"Movements are destroyed by conflicts over money, power, and credit,\" Garza said, a week after the cancellation. \"We have to take seriously the impact of not being able to have principled disagreement, or we're not going to be around very long.\"\n\nAlmost from the outset, Black Lives Matter has been compared to the Occupy movement. Occupy was similarly associated with a single issue-income inequality-which it transformed into a movement through social media. Its focus on the one per cent played a key role in the 2012 election, and it likely contributed to the unexpected support for Bernie Sanders's campaign. To the movement's critics, however, its achievements fell short of its promise. Its dissipation seemed to prove that, while the Internet can foster the creation of a new movement, it can just as easily threaten its survival.\n\nBlack Lives Matter would appear to face similar concerns, though in recent months the movement has tacked in new directions. In November, the Ella Baker Center received a five-hundred-thousand-dollar grant from Google, for Patrisse Cullors to further develop a program to help California residents monitor and respond to acts of police violence. Last year, Mckesson, with Elzie, Brittany Packnett, and Samuel Sinyangwe, a twenty-five-year-old data analyst with a degree from Stanford, launched Campaign Zero, a list of policing-policy recommendations that calls for, among other things, curtailing arrests for low-level crimes, reducing quotas for summonses and arrests, and demilitarizing police departments. To date, neither Clinton nor Sanders has endorsed the platform, but both have met with the activists to discuss it.\n\nThe announcement of Mckesson's mayoral candidacy, which he made on Twitter-he has more than three hundred thousand followers-is the most dramatic break from the movement's previous actions. (Beyoncé has more than fourteen million followers, but she follows only ten people. Mckesson is one of them.) Mckesson is a native of Baltimore and he grew up on the same side of town as Freddie Gray, whose death last year in police custody sparked protests and riots in the city-at which Mckesson was a frequent presence. His family struggled with poverty and drug addiction, but he excelled academically and went on to attend Bowdoin College, in Maine. He will be running against twenty-eight other candidates. One of them, the city councilman Nick Mosby, is married to Marilyn Mosby, the Maryland state's attorney, who is handling the prosecution of the six police officers indicted in connection with Gray's death.\n\nIn Baltimore, Mckesson told me that he is using his savings to fund his activist work. \"It's totally possible to have Beyoncé follow you on Twitter and still be broke,\" he said. (BuzzFeed reported that a former Citibank executive would host an event at his New York City home to raise funds for Mckesson's campaign.) He wouldn't discuss his candidacy's implications for the movement, but he is very serious about running. Two weeks ago, he released a twenty-six-page report detailing his platform for reforming the city's schools, police department, and economic infrastructure. He has already been attacked for his connection to Teach for America; after he released his plan for improving Baltimore's schools, it was dismissed as a corporatist undertaking along the lines of Michael Bloomberg's and Rahm Emanuel's reforms. He rejects the idea that his lack of experience in elected office should be an obstacle. When I asked how he thought he would be able to get members of the city council and the state legislature to support his ideas, he said, \"I think we build relationships. That question seems to come from a place of traditional reading of politics. That says, 'If you don't know people already, then you cannot be successful.' Politics as usual actually hasn't turned into a change in outcomes here.\"\n\nGarza is tactful when she talks about Mckesson's campaign. \"I'm in favor of people getting in where they fit in. Wherever you feel you can make the greatest contribution, you should,\" she said. But she doesn't see it as her role to define the future of the movement. She told me an anecdote that illustrates the non-centrality of her role. Last month, on Martin Luther King Day, she and Malachi were driving into San Francisco, where she was scheduled to appear at a community forum, when they heard on the radio that the Bay Bridge had been shut down. Members of a coalition of organizations, including the Bay Area chapter of Black Lives Matter, had driven onto the bridge, laced chains through their car windows, and locked them to the girders, shutting down entry to the city from Oakland. Garza had known that there were plans to mark the holiday with a protest-marches and other events were called across the nation-but she was not informed of this specific activity planned in her own city. \"It's not like there's a red button I push to make people turn up,\" she said. It would have been inconceivable for, say, the S.C.L.C. to have carried out such an ambitious action without the leadership's being aware of every detail.\n\nIn January, Garza travelled to Washington, to attend President Obama's final State of the Union address; she had been invited by Barbara Lee, her congressional representative. (Lee, who was the sole member of Congress to vote against the authorization of military force after 9/11, has a high standing among activists who are normally skeptical of elected officials.) After the speech, as Garza stood outside in the cold, trying to hail a cab, she said that she was disappointed. The President had not driven home the need for police reform. He had spoken of economic inequality and a political system rigged to benefit the few, but had scarcely touched upon the implications of that system for African-Americans specifically. From the vantage point of black progressives, his words were a kind of all-lives-matter statement of public policy.\n\nA year from now, Barack Obama will leave office, and with him will go a particular set of expectations of racial rapprochement. So will the sense that what happened in Sanford, Ferguson, Baltimore, Charleston, and Staten Island represents a paradox. Black Lives Matter may never have more influence than it has now. The future is not knowable, but it isn't likely to be unfamiliar. ♦\n\nAn earlier version of this article misstated Mckesson's age at the time.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "Did Last Summer's Black Lives Matter Protests Change Anything?\n\nOn June 1st last year, a week after George Floyd was murdered, more than three hundred fires blazed across Philadelphia, according to police. In the previous days, there had been reports of two hundred commercial burglaries-otherwise known as looting-and more than a hundred and fifty acts of vandalism. Four hundred people had been arrested, and the National Guard was on the way. By that Saturday, June 6th, tens of thousands of people clogged the streets of downtown, demanding justice, proclaiming that Black Lives Matter. For eight consecutive nights, the city was choked with tear gas, ruled by curfews. It wasn't yet summer, but Philadelphia was on fire.\n\nThe intensity and the duration of the protests indicated that the problems went much deeper than the lynching of a Black man in Minneapolis. Beyond the issue of racist police violence, Philadelphia has the largest portion of its population living in poverty of any major city in the United States. Not coincidentally, it also has one of the largest Black populations of major American cities. Bitterness rising out of neglect and indifference to poverty, drug addiction, and housing insecurity in poor and working-class Black neighborhoods came back to haunt the political and economic élite.\n\nMayor Jim Kenney, an unremarkable career politician, was forced to make unprecedented pledges to address the issues of racism, police brutality, and inequality in the \"city of brotherly love.\" By June 4th, Kenney had established a new commission, called Pathways to Reform, Transformation, and Reconciliation , to \"advance public safety and racial equity,\" representing \"a formal commitment to enact a long-lasting reform agenda.\" In its mission statement, the commission declared that \"racism in America and Philadelphia is both systemic and institutionalized, with far-reaching effects on political engagement, economic opportunities, health outcomes, and overall life chances for Black and Brown communities. These communities have experienced racial inequalities over generations, which have contributed to structural violence and pervasive poverty in the city.\"\n\nA year later, the Kenney administration released a report assessing Pathways' impact on the city. Kenney said , \"We believe we are well on our way to learning from our past, taking accountability for our mistakes and driving change that will make our government and our city stronger for all Philadelphians.\" But the \"change\" was so paltry that it was an affront to the traumas that it claimed to address. A police-reform subcommittee was led by the city's police commissioner, the aptly named Danielle Outlaw, who spent months barely hanging on to her job after it was revealed that she had championed the use of tear gas against nonviolent protesters who were trapped on a highway cutting through downtown Philadelphia. The reform package included a ban on the use of tear gas at demonstrations and a prohibition against \"kneeling on a person's neck, face, or head.\" It sidestepped the key demands of the B.L.M. protests-namely, the redistribution of resources away from police and toward other public agencies that are better equipped to change patterns of violence and crime.\n\nAs a tool to undo systemic racism, economic reform, too, was a dead end. The smallest of the subcommittees, called Inclusive Economy, was filled with a hodgepodge of local officials, a developer, and Black businessmen. Beneath soaring rhetoric about \"inspiring collaborative efforts,\" Philadelphia distributed a measly thirteen million dollars in grants and loans to two thousand business owners. Only sixty-six per cent went to minority business owners-a category that included anyone who is not a white man. It's not clear how much of that funding went to Black business owners, and it's also not clear how financing Black business owners relates to ending poverty and discrimination against Black poor and working-class people. Not all Black people have the same interests, even if they have the same skin color.\n\nPhiladelphia is not very different from the rest of the United States-caught between a recognition that racism is rooted in unfair and unequal conditions, created within public and private sectors, and reproduced over time and place, and a reluctance to take drastic action to cure it. Democrats on the federal and local levels have mastered the language of racial contrition, lamenting the conditions that nourish inequality, while doing the bare minimum to change them.\n\nTrue to their sensibilities, elected officials quickly tugged the low-hanging fruit of symbolic transformation. In Philadelphia, Kenney's office raced to take down a statue of the notorious police commissioner and mayor Frank Rizzo, as if to demonstrate that the city was moving away from its history of racism and police brutality. Across the South, officials resumed the removal of the racist iconography of the Confederacy. Even Nascar prohibited displays of the Confederate flag, which had been so prominent at its races, as a concession to the B.L.M. movement and the protests of its only Black driver, Bubba Wallace. Removing these artifacts is only an initial step in addressing the longstanding and substantively more consequential effects of systemic racism. But the rejection of racist symbols, including those commemorating the Confederacy, was an acute response to the fact that they had become important tools for the white-supremacist fringe of the Republican Party, full of contemporary as well as historical meaning. From Dylann Roof's display of the Confederate flag before he massacred nine African Americans in Charleston to the Unite the Right rally in defense of a statue of Robert E. Lee in Charlottesville, these were symbols of white supremacy as a feature of American life.\n\nThe Juneteenth holiday was, too, in some ways, a product of political expediency. Democrats locked in debate over the importance of the filibuster and the size and scope of the Biden Administration's signature infrastructure legislation could unite in fast-tracking the creation of a federal holiday. Even Republicans, who were leading a scorched-earth backlash against last summer's racial awakening, could concede that there was no harm in recognizing the end of slavery. In fact, it could fit in with their rosy view of the United States as ever ascendant. As a result, there were some who expressed cynicism about the newfound interest in Juneteenth, at a time when there have been no major policy developments in response to last year's protests. The Boston Globe columnist Renée Graham pointed out the hypocrisy of Republican senators who voted for the Juneteenth holiday while blocking other legislation of particular importance to African Americans. She wrote , \"On crucial issues where Republican votes would really matter, [Mitch] McConnell offers nothing. But, hey, at least we got a new holiday, right?\" Robert A. Brown, of Morehouse, put it this way , in an opinion piece for NPR: \"There is a growing discontent in the African American community with symbolic gestures that are presented as progress without any accompanying economic or structural change.\"\n\nBoth are correct, but we cannot only measure the impact or importance of last year's protests in terms of the passage of reform legislation. First, sixty-nine per cent of African Americans supported making Juneteenth a federal holiday. Nearly half of Americans support adding its history to school curricula. Second, the creation of the Juneteenth National Independence Day is the closest that our society has come to acknowledging the legacy of slavery as a fact of American life. It is truly astounding that Juneteenth has become the first official recognition and celebration of the end of slavery in the United States, some hundred and fifty-six years after the end of the Civil War. The official failure to articulate the fact of slavery and its effects throughout the entire country-not only the South-have made it difficult to comprehend its most elemental consequences, including the degraded view of African Americans as inherently inferior to white people. It left the country ill-prepared to understand the grievous circumstances that Black Americans endured thereafter.\n\nThe retelling of the history of Black Americans with slavery as its anchor injects a historical materiality into our understanding of Black communities' hardships. This development is deeply consequential. When the Black movement of the nineteen-sixties insisted that racial discrimination was the cause of the disproportionate poverty, housing insecurity, and unemployment in Black communities, it justified Black demands for specific public policies and programs as a remedy. Today, we are witnessing similar dynamics. Even when we are rightly cynical about corporate America's denunciations of \"systemic racism,\" or when we question the intentions of elected officials who are quick to point out the existence of racism but slow to use their legislative powers to do something about it, we should recognize how much the conversation has changed. There is now widespread agreement that racism has been embedded in the public and private institutions that govern our lives and dictate our access to services, justifying the demands for specific actions to undo the harmful results.\n\nAccording to Gallup, the number of Americans who agree that opportunities are equally good for Black and white people are at their lowest point since it began tracking the issue, in 1963. The perception of racial equality in the job market is at its lowest level in forty years. Although those figures have largely been driven down by cratering expectations of Black people, they also point to a changing awareness among white people of the difficulties encountered by African Americans. Even on crime, where conservatives believe that they can erode support for Democratic programs by blaming progressives for rising murder rates, the insistence of the B.L.M. movement that we link violence to social deprivation has for now changed public views . Nearly sixty per cent of Americans say that crime is an \"extremely\" or very serious problem in the country, and, although fifty-five per cent agree that more spending on police could lower the crime rate, seventy-five per cent believe that \"increasing funding to build economic opportunities in poor communities\" could also reduce violent crime. Sixty-five per cent think that using \"social workers to defuse situations\" could lower crime. These ideas are not easily categorized: they do not belong to particular camps, advocating particular things. When ideas are in flux, it means that people are open to change.\n\nThis is at least one of the reasons that Republicans are blaming critical race theory for dividing Americans. If those theorists are correct in their assertions that racism and discrimination have been structuring features of American public policy and private enterprise since the end of slavery, then the right's premise-that those disparities are a manifestation of problems within Black families and Black communities-would cease to make sense. Demands for a welfare state, reparations, and a robust regime of anti-racist regulatory oversight as a corrective to those historical practices would be legitimized. Even the most moderate Republicans still believe in the U.S. as a place where color blindness and unimpeded social mobility allow anyone from anywhere to reach the heights of social acceptance and personal wealth. Critical race theory and other critiques of entrenched racism, as well as historical studies of slavery and the legal racism that replaced it, repudiate this version of the American Dream.\n\nBut Republicans are not only interested in debunking what they contend is the myth of \"structural racism\"; they are also seeking to undermine the possibility of solidarity between regular white people and their Black and brown peers. In some ways, it is the lack of solidarity between them that has the greatest potential to undermine an increasingly common view of the need for greater government, a redistribution of wealth and resources, and better housing and health care. Last fall, the number of Americans expressing a desire for the government to do more \"to solve our country's problems\" had risen to fifty-four per cent, according to Gallup-again, the highest number since it began tracking the question, in 1992. Even seventy-one per cent of Republicans under forty-five said that they support increased public spending, even if it means raising taxes. The invented crisis of critical race theory is also intended to sow tension and suspicion among those who have an interest in solidarity and connection.\n\nNationally, Democrats have obviously become much more inclined to spend public money, in hopes of putting out the fires that ignited last summer. But their long-term plans, the essence of \"structural\" or \"transformational\" change, seem hazy at best. They have mastered the language of activists but have often used it without substance, as they battle among themselves about how much to change. In Philadelphia, that has meant lots of broken promises, from last year to this year. In Buffalo, New York, it has meant that India Walton, a democratic socialist, is in a standoff with the four-term sitting mayor, Byron Brown, who lost the Democratic Party primary to Walton in June. Despite raising only a fraction of Brown's fund-raising total of half a million dollars, Walton won the primary by taking on racist and brutal policing, and by challenging gentrification and escalating rents across the city-conditions that resulted, in part, from Brown's policies, which prioritized growth and development at the expense of poor and working-class residents, most of whom are Black. Brown has promised a write-in challenge and will have supporters with deep pockets, but Walton will be difficult to beat. It is hard to imagine that this seismic shock inside New York's Democratic Party would have been possible without last summer's revolt.\n\nThe level of protest from last summer was impossible to sustain, but it lifted the horizons of what could be demanded from elected officials and the private corporations that are at the center of this economy. The local battles are important because they dictate the conditions of most people's daily lives, but the shaping of political narratives really happens on the national level. The start of the pandemic last spring and then the summer's protests worked like the contrasting dye used in M.R.I. scans, highlighting all of the imperfections in the internal structures of the United States. But awareness alone has never been enough to change these conditions, and now the hard work of moving from diagnosis to treatment is under way. We need new tools, including new organizations and strategies, that can actually deliver on the demands that brought so many into the streets last summer. Unrealized demands for change can turn into cynicism, despair, and detachment, leaving the forces of reaction intact and on the offensive. Our moment is full of promise and also peril.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "How Black Lives Matter fits into the long history of American radicalism\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\n\"Any movement that goes to the root of things is radical.\"\n\nby Sean Illing\n\nBlack Lives Matter was created in 2013 by three Black women - Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi - in response to the acquittal of Trayvon Martin's killer, George Zimmerman . Over the last seven years, it has evolved into something much bigger: a broad multiethnic liberation movement focused on criminal justice reform, racist policing, and adjacent causes.\n\nDuring the course of this shift, the movement has not only expanded but become more radical in its demands for equality across the board. And yet, surprisingly, this has increased, rather than diminished, its appeal.\n\nBLM had little support across the country as recently as 2017. But it has become steadily more popular, and in the aftermath of George Floyd's murder , its popularity has surged to the point that it's now supported by a majority of Americans . By any measure, that suggests BLM is succeeding - culturally and politically.\n\nBut how should we think of Black Lives Matter as a historical phenomenon? Is it the sort of radical social movement we've seen before in this country? Or is it something new, something different, without any precursors?\n\nTo get some answers, I reached out to Michael Kazin, a professor of history and American social movements at Georgetown University and also the co-editor of Dissent magazine. We discussed how BLM fits into the long tradition of American radicalism, what its proponents can learn from previous eras, and why he thinks BLM is both a political and a cultural struggle.\n\nA lightly edited transcript of our conversation follows.\n\nAs someone who studies the history of social movements in America, how do you view this moment?\n\nIt's a remarkable moment in some ways, because we have a very unpopular right-wing president and a set of popular social movements on the left. Which is surprising, because usually social movements on the left get more popular when you have a liberal or progressive president in office. This is what happened in the '30s and '60s, for example. I think we might be witnessing the end of a conservative era.\n\nWhat does the end of a conservative era mean?\n\nWell, we've had Democratic presidents in this era, Clinton and Obama, but the guiding ideas of the time have been conservative ideas about government and labor and race. And now that could be changing in a very radical way.\n\nIf Democrats are able to win the presidency and tip both houses of Congress, then you could see another major vault to the left in American history, the kind of vault we saw during Reconstruction and during the progressive eras in the '30s and '60s and early '70s. But all of this energy doesn't always translate to big legislative revolutions. For laws to pass, it'll take a combination of left-wing social movements and politicians who are willing to accommodate those movements in important ways.\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement is at the forefront of this leftward push. Do you consider BLM a radical social movement, or does it just seem that way to those who are more invested in the current order?\n\nLike all large social movements, it has its radical aspects and its more reformist aspects. That was true of the labor movement in the '30s, which had a lot of communists and socialists in it. It was true of Reconstruction too, in which you had more radical Republicans like Thaddeus Stevens, who wanted to confiscate the land of anybody who had fought for the Confederacy and give it to African Americans, to freed slaves. We saw it in the '60s as well, when the Black Freedom Movement had its reformist side pushing for integration of institutions and the Voter Rights Act, Civil Rights Act, and you had the Black Panthers and other Black Power groups who wanted one big revolution.\n\nSo you see this dynamic in every mass social movement. It's hard to say what will become of BLM. You've got the different aspects to it. People can unite around some moderate demands like passing laws that will handcuff the police in terms of their capacity to use violence. The more radical aspects, like abolishing the police altogether, go much further. And there are conversations about reparations and restructuring the economy to ensure not just equal opportunities but equal outcomes.\n\nAs the movement gets larger, you'll see more differences within it. But no single one of those manifestations will define the movement as a whole.\n\nWhat makes a \"radical\" movement radical? Is it more about the nature of the demands? Or how those demands are perceived by the power structure?\n\nThat's a very good question. The power structure, of course, often perceives any movement that wants to change the fundamentals of how the country operates as radical. Martin Luther King Jr. was perceived to be a radical - and I think he was. But the demands he was making publicly, until the end of his life, really weren't that radical. He simply wanted the 14th and 15th Amendments to be applied to Black people.\n\nAny movement that goes to the root of things is radical. An anti-capitalism movement is radical. A movement which calls for reparations for African Americans is radical. There's a radical ethics that diagnoses something wrong about the basic organization of society and seeks to undo that wrong, and conservative figures in power have always viewed these efforts as existential threats.\n\nThe New Deal was perceived as radically socialist by a lot of people in business and in the power structure, but in retrospect it was really just reformist.\n\nThe shifting perception of these movements is fascinating to me, especially in this moment. In the case of Black Lives Matter, it's remarkable to see just how popular it has become. In the last two weeks alone, I believe, support for BLM has increased as much as it has in the last two years .\n\nWhat does that signal to you?\n\nIt signals that racial attitudes in America, which began to change after World War II and then took a big step forward in the 1960s with the success of the Black Freedom Movement and the Civil Rights Act, have really evolved. This has been a very long and hard road, with moments of backlash along the way, but this is what you'd expect because racism is so deeply woven into that fabric of American history and culture. Obviously, the horrific killing of George Floyd was a catalyst, but I think we're seeing the results of young people coming of age and being much more open to racial equality than previous generations.\n\nAnd BLM, whatever one thinks of it, strikes me as the continuation of some of the most successful social movements in American history.\n\nI think that's right, and two of those movements, the Abolitionist movement and the Black Freedom Movement, were also organized around the demands of equality for African-Americans. Of course, you could say this is all part of one long movement, but it had various phases to it. I think what we're seeing now is very much part of the Black Freedom Movement, which has had its ups and downs throughout its history. But the thread tying all of it together has always been the push for fundamental equality at every level of society and in every major institution.\n\nWhat's interesting about BLM is that it could be a catalyst to a reform movement in the same way the labor movement in the '30s was essential to moving the Democratic Party to the left. A lot of people don't know this, but it was really in the '30s that the Democrats began to move away from Jim Crow . It took a long time, obviously, but that's when it started, and it was because labor was interracial and labor was crucial to the success of the Democrats in the '30s and '40s.\n\nHow were these previous movements greeted when they emerged? I ask because the goals seem, in retrospect, so sensible and obvious, but I imagine at the time they were seen as extremist and threatening.\n\nDefinitely. The great Italian theorist Antonio Gramsci talked about how social movements can change the common sense of society. What we all take to be normal or moral in society can change pretty quickly, and it changes because of the force and success of social movements. Black Lives Matter has been enormously successful in this respect. Any movement pushing for this level of change will be opposed by people who don't support those changes - that's just an axiom of politics. What's astonishing about this movement is that it's not provoking more backlash - at least not yet.\n\nWell, I wonder about the \"not yet\" part. I worry about movements like Black Lives Matter or \"abolish the police\" becoming so sprawling and disjointed that they lose their focus, or get overwhelmed by revolutionary spasms that may undercut the key goals.\n\nAre there important lessons from the past on this front?\n\nI was a New Leftist in the late '60s. I was one of those people who went too far. I think I undermined some of my goals, even though in the end we were successful in winning our main demands, which were to fight for racial equality and an end to the Vietnam War. But along the way I did some stupid things.\n\nI think one big lesson is that mass lawbreaking undermines a movement. As MLK used to say, you want the other side to be seen as the violent side, you want the other side reacting to your civil disobedience, to your respect for order. You don't want to be seen as running amok without leadership, without discipline, because you're trying to bring about change and people are scared of change. You don't want people to be scared of you at the same time they're scared of change. That's one lesson.\n\nAnother lesson is the importance of building alliances. One of the reasons why I keep saying that leftists should support Biden and ally with Pelosi and Chuck Schumer this year is that we have to get as many Democrats as possible elected because only then will there be the political space to go further than they would like to go. There are limits to what a movement can create on its own. Eventually, you've got to get laws passed, and a movement can't pass laws by itself.\n\nIs it better to view BLM or \"abolish the police\" less as political projects and more as cultural movements that shift the zeitgeist and therefore pave the way for political changes in the future?\n\nIt's a great question, and I think it's both for me. As I said before, it's obviously helped to change the attitudes of a lot of white Americans and that's a cultural change in consciousness. Without that change in consciousness, we can't get real political changes because there would be too much resistance to them, and politicians are averse to doing things which are unpopular.\n\nSo it's important to demand immediate change but also wise to not expect it to happen that fast. These things take a long time. If activists don't have a longterm strategy, they're going to fail. This isn't easy, of course. On the one hand, you want movements to build on a sense of urgency when outrage happens, the way it did with George Floyd and with other Black Americans killed by the police. But at the same time, you can't let that sense of urgency impede you from organizing for the long-term.\n\nMy sense is that we're still very much in the beginning of whatever this is, and so there's a lot of symbolic activism and a lot of enthusiasm but not necessarily a clear strategy for seizing power. What do you think a movement like this can do to channel all this energy and goodwill into enduring, concrete changes?\n\nI think it has to find ways to work with other movements on the left. The change these activists seek is one of economic equity as well as an end to racist treatment by the cops. That was true for the Black movement in Fredrick Douglass's day as well as the freedom movement led, in part, by MLK in the 1960s. The fight to have the power over how the police treat you is necessarily a fight to gain more power and resources on the job, in one's neighborhood, and in education. But Black people can't win that fight by themselves. It will take allies from other races and a demand for universal programs in health care, the environment, housing, etc. - and interracial institutions like labor and, yes, the Democratic Party.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe power of the movement lies in making the public, and politicians, take notice.\n\nby Fabiola Cineas\n\nSince its founding in 2013, Black Lives Matter has awakened millions across the globe to how Black people are systematically targeted for violence. The member-led network was formed by three Black women - Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi - in response to the acquittal of George Zimmerman , the man who killed Trayvon Martin. Since then, the movement can claim credit for protests in the name of everyone from Michael Brown , who was killed by a police officer in St. Louis, Missouri, in 2014, to Breonna Taylor , who was killed by police officers in Louisville, Kentucky, this March. Though the organization has renewed what may seem like a new fight for civil rights in the 21st century, it is in every way building on a long history of activism that goes back to slavery.\n\nAs University of Pittsburgh historian Keisha N. Blain argues, if we were to draw a line straight from 1619 to the present, it would be clear that Black Lives Matter is one major wave in a larger narrative. \"If civil rights ultimately means citizenship rights, then that means that you would be fighting for it for as long as you don't have it,\" Blain told Vox.\n\nBut to fully understand the change that Black Lives Matter is effecting today, we also have to look to the 20th century to examine how the movement is advancing the ideology and strategy of Black female justice seekers like Ella Baker and Fannie Lou Hamer, and even lesser-known activists like Mary Bumpurs and Veronica Perry, who joined together to fight police violence in the '80s.\n\nSuch an exercise also helps us see where the movement stopped short - and continues to. Blain argues that overlooking Bumpurs and Perry and currently excluding Black women from the police violence debate sets up a false sense of security for Black women. \"I've had people say to me that as a mother, I should be concerned about my son because police violence is so prominent. And they're right - I have to think about it,\" she says. \"But I have to say to them, 'I have to be concerned about me too.' I have to tell them, 'Remember Sandra Bland and Korryn Gaines? People are somewhat startled because they don't immediately think about those names.\"\n\nI talked to Blain, author of Set the World on Fire: Black Nationalist Women and the Global Struggle for Freedom , about how Black Lives Matter is advancing the efforts of hundreds of activists who fought for Black liberation in the US and abroad - and how the movement's impact stands out from past efforts. Our conversation has been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nIn your book and other writings, you've repeatedly said that Black Lives Matter is currently building on a longer history of activism. Can you explain how the organization is doing that with the protests currently underway?\n\nThere are several factors. I focus a bit on Black nationalist politics, and there are several threads that I see between Black nationalist movements of the 20th century and the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nOne is the focus on community control. One of the things that Black Lives Matter activists have been demanding for quite a while is greater community control. Today we're talking about it within the context of policing. But in general, they have been demanding the need for Black people within Black communities to make their own decisions about how the communities would be controlled and how things will be run, as opposed to having people from the outside impose upon them their strategies and tactics. And we see that certainly in the 1960s context but even earlier to the 1920s, with groups like the Universal Negro Improvement Association [a Black nationalist organization founded by Jamaican activists Amy Ashwood and Marcus Garvey]. These organizations emphasize the importance of Black communities having greater say and autonomy. So, ideologically, we see this thread.\n\nThe second connection that stands out to me is the vision of internationalism, which is one of the core ideas of the Black Lives Matter movement. I would say a lot of people don't focus on it as much as they should. Black Lives Matter activists have been very vocal about showing that the fight to end state-sanctioned violence is not solely a US problem, but it is a global problem . And, not surprisingly, we've seen the creation of Black Lives Matter movements in various parts of the world - in London, Berlin, Toronto, and more. That is intentional, and it's actually to the core of their message.\n\nThe movement has previously stated the importance of internationalism and broadening the vision beyond just a national conversation. They've expressed the importance of collaborating across nations to demand an end to state-sanctioned violence. This is key to various movements throughout US history. Black political movements have been deeply internationalist in their perspective, whether it's in the '60s with civil rights activists connecting their struggles to African liberation struggles or whether it's even earlier Black activists standing up in defense of Ethiopia. These are the ideological threads.\n\nHow do you see Black Lives Matter furthering these ideologies and advancing these threads?\n\nWhat is perhaps novel in the contemporary moment is the specific focus on anti-Black law enforcement. If we think of Black Lives Matter as an idea, we can trace the history far back and draw connections to Frederick Douglass, Ida B. Wells, James Baldwin - all of these individuals who were in effect insisting that Black lives matter and that we need to create policies and laws that demonstrate how Black lives matter. In a way, this is part of a larger struggle.\n\nAnd I'm not suggesting that these early activists didn't talk about law enforcement; they certainly did. But I would say that the way the contemporary Black Lives Matter movement managed to bring the issue to the forefront, that is a distinct trait. Because we talked about police violence in the past - even someone like Martin Luther King talked about police violence; Hamer talked about it. But it almost didn't capture people's attention the way that it captured people's attention in 2014 or in 2015 after the killings of Trayvon Martin and Mike Brown.\n\nSo Black Lives Matter, they were almost able to harness the moment as soon as these unfortunate incidents took place. They were able to get people on board, and not just regular American citizens, but politicians - that part is key.\n\nIn the 2016 election, I was intrigued by how many candidates, leading up to the election, kept talking about Black Lives Matter, even Republicans. Those in the running before Trump became the nominee were trying to figure out how to weave it in. They recognized the significance of the moment, so they needed to gesture to it in some way without offending their base. And certainly, Democratic nominees were grappling with it, too. Black Lives Matter managed to capture the attention of people, but also of individuals who wield political power. That, to me, is quite distinctive.\n\nWhat about the pace and speed at which today's movement is bringing about change? How does it compare to the speed at which movements of the past operated?\n\nIt's hard to say because I think about history as a very long movement. For example, when we think of the civil rights movement, we generally mean the '50s and '60s. But I would argue that you can't quite understand the civil rights movement in the '50s and '60s if you don't look back to even the '20s or the '30s. It's almost as if you wanted to put a straight line from 1619, which in itself is a troubled date, but imagine that you started there. You could argue that the movement for civil rights began at the very moment that the group of 20 Africans landed in Jamestown. You could make that argument because they arrived at a moment where they didn't have full political rights and freedom. If civil rights ultimately means citizenship rights, then that means that you would be fighting for it for as long as you don't have it.\n\nSo there are certain gains that took place in the '50s and '60s. We can talk about the Voting Rights Act, the Civil Rights Act, the Brown decision - all these things matter. But you don't quite understand how we get to Brown if you don't look back to some of the earlier efforts to integrate public spaces. You can't even talk about the Voting Rights Act if you don't go back to the US Constitution and think about the 14th and 15th Amendments, which were passed in the 19th century. So, when you think about Black Lives Matter, you can think about it as a continual struggle. You could argue, then, that the movement for civil rights has been a very long movement, but the difference is the waves, ebbs, and flows - moments when you're able to accomplish some things and moments when we struggled before accomplishing some more. That's why I see Black Lives Matter as an extension. It's not a direct line.\n\nWhat about the structure of Black Lives Matter? Early on, people were looking for one central hub of Black Lives Matter or one central leader, but Black Lives Matter made it clear that they were decentralized and spread out, with different organizations all across the country. How does this structure line up with the structure of groups and movements in the past?\n\nWhat's interesting is the structure of Black Lives Matter, actually, in so many ways, encapsulates this idea of group central leadership, which is an idea that comes directly from Ella Baker, a civil rights activist who mentored Black activists in the SNCC, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, in the 1960s. This is an organization that actually grew out of a bit of resistance with an earlier movement - the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which is an organization that Martin Luther King Jr. ran.\n\nBoth organizations were interesting because in many ways, they demonstrated the generational divide at the time, which is in some ways still reflective today. So SNCC, the younger activists, their approach was very much about avoiding one central leader. The thinking was if you have one leader, one person who represents the voice of the movement, crippling the movement isn't so difficult. All you have to do is attack their leader. And obviously people figured that out, which is why, unfortunately, Martin Luther King was assassinated in 1968. And then someone like Malcolm X was assassinated. You have all of these key people who get targeted in order to cripple a movement.\n\nWhat Ella Baker was saying is we need a kind of movement that is leaderless. But while it was articulated as leaderless, it materialized with multiple leaders - multiple leaders without one necessarily dominating over the other. And it allowed space for people to go from participant to leader in a very rapid moment. You could just be mentored and encouraged by someone to use your gifting - you could just lead within whatever context. We saw that in the 1960s when Ella Baker mentored someone like Fannie Lou Hamer, [a community organizer and co-founder of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]. Now we talk about Fannie Lou Hamer as a leader, but Hamer would not be someone we even talk about were it not for the fact that the movement made space for someone like her to emerge.\n\nSo Black Lives Matter is drawing upon that earlier model of Ella Baker. But you and I both know that it doesn't play out the way you imagine. Because even when we say the movement is leaderless, it doesn't stop, for example, the media from determining who they think the leader is.\n\nThe same people get called over and over again, sometimes overlooking even the founders of Black Lives Matter. There have been situations where there are conversations about the movement where not even one of the original founders [is] at the table and one wonders how that is even possible. Did someone invite them? Did they just immediately go to the men? So even when you try to have a movement that is group-centered in its leadership, external factors impose in ways that you just can't control.\n\nI'd love to talk more about your focus on Black women and how Black women are building on a unique history of activism. You've written about how Black women are being left out of discussions about policing and then how that connects to their activist roots.\n\nThe first thing that I would emphasize is Black women and girls are vulnerable to state-sanctioned violence. It almost seems like an obvious statement, but the sad part is that I don't think many people fully get it, or even accept it. And I know this to be true because I think about even personal narratives where I've had people say to me that as a mother, I should be concerned about my son because police violence is so prominent. And they're right - I have to think about it.\n\nBut I have to say to them, \"I have to be concerned about me too.\" I have to tell them, \"Remember Sandra Bland and Korryn Gaines?\" People are somewhat startled because they don't immediately think about those names. They think about Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, or Mike Brown. And I'm not suggesting that we shouldn't think about those individuals, but the danger is we fall into this thinking that Black men and Black men alone are the ones who are targeted by the police, and [that] maybe gives Black women a false sense of security, though reality tells us otherwise.\n\nI write about this to remind us that this is a problem and simply say that the challenge here is being targeted for Blackness. And that's whether we're talking about Black women and girls or Black trans men. If you are Black, you can absolutely lose your life - in an instant - once you have an encounter with the police.\n\nThe other part that is key is how people overlook how significant Black women are to the movement against American policing. I mentioned Black Lives Matter and the fact that it was founded by three women. But how about the example of Sean Bell. He was shot in Queens, New York, in 2006 on the morning of his wedding. He unfortunately was never able to get married. The person who emerged following his killing was his fiancé, Nicole Bell, who for more than 10 years and till this day is still fighting to not only keep his memory alive but to bring about some concrete changes. We don't often talk about Nicole Bell. Or how about Trayvon Martin's mother?\n\nWith the focus on Black men who are targeted by police, we often don't spend time thinking about all the people they're connected to, including all the women they're connected to - the mothers, the sisters, the daughters who then carry the mantle forward to demand justice not just for them but for every single person who lost their life. This includes the mother of Amadou Diallo [Kadiatou Diallo], the daughter of Eric Garner [Erica Garner], who unfortunately passed away, and now [Eric] Garner's mother, Gwen Carr. The list goes on and on.\n\nI try to get people to understand that you can't talk about police violence from any angle without centering the ideas, experiences, and activism of Black women.\n\nCan you highlight any women from earlier waves of the struggle who you think show us how Black women today are building on that person's activism?\n\nFor a few years, I've been researching Mary Bumpurs and Veronica Perry. They are two women who people would know about in the context of New York. Mary Bumpurs's mother, 66-year-old Eleanor Bumpurs, was killed by police in 1984. Police had been called to her home for what was supposed to be a wellness check. She did not want to leave her apartment, as she was having some mental health issues at the time. They wanted to evict her, and she was resisting. The officer at the time said she had a knife and was charging toward him, so he shot her.\n\nA year later, Veronica Perry's son, Edmund Perry, was shot at age 17 by a plainclothes police officer.\n\nThese two women, who didn't know each other before, actually collaborated. These women came together in the 1980s and decided that they will try to figure out how to change policing in New York City. They organized events and meetings with local officials to talk about changing policies that would push for legislation to stop police killings. They came together to reflect and just be together and support each other. This reminds me of the Mothers of the Movement today. There are so many parallels to the present.\n\nTheir story really moves me, but a lot of people don't know about them. Because these police killings are happening so frequently, the news cycle keeps changing and shifting our focus. But the loved ones of those killed can never shift their attention because it stays with them forever. They keep pushing and demanding changes. If we were to focus on the work that the mothers are doing, you're able to see this longer history; you can see how the work of the Mothers of the Movement is a part of a longer tradition of Black women trying to figure out how to stop this. Sadly, it keeps happening over and over again. The fact that Gwen Carr showed up at the funeral of George Floyd is a symbol of how the struggle continues.\n\nSo what comes next? Can you comment on the kind of change that you see Black Lives Matter bringing forward in this long tradition? What are tangible things that you see happening besides dialogue?\n\nWhat Black Lives Matter has been able to do is move the members of the Democratic establishment a bit further to the left. Joe Biden is still very much careful about how he's even addressing police violence. We've seen him go back and forth on it, and he may or may not come to the place where he fully supports protesters who say defund the police. Mass protests work. Historically, we know that those who wield power make decisions sometimes driven by their own personal convictions. But for the most part, they make decisions because people compel them to do it.\n\nBlack Lives Matter as a movement is powerful. They may or may not accomplish the tangible goals within their lifetime, but what they are able to do is capture people's attention. They force people who might otherwise be complacent to listen and consider changing their view. They mobilize people on the ground, who in turn place pressure on leaders to do something. Results from polls that show how many people now support defunding the police are extraordinary. I don't think it'd be possible without a group like Black Lives Matter shedding light on the problem of policing and doing so since 2014.

These cries were mostly confined to the Missouri city and other metropolitan areas, and came from the voices of Black Americans. They didn't ring out in Trinidad and Tobago, where I was living and had fled to due to systemic racism.\n\nNow, years later, social unrest is gripping the US in response to the killing of George Floyd at the hands of police, and racism has come under the microscope once again. But this time, the uprisings are happening across the world.\n\nEarlier this month , hundreds took to the streets to stand in solidarity with Black Lives Matter in Poland. On the same day, Tokyo protesters marched and carried signs that read \"Stop racism in Japan!\" and \"Black Lives Matter.\" In Bogota, Colombia , local protesters burned an American flag and also called attention to police brutality and racism within its own borders, including the death of Anderson Arboleda, who was killed by Colombian police for violating quarantine. From London to South Africa, thousands are taking a stand in solidarity with African Americans in the fight against police brutality.\n\nAs an American expat, it's been awe-inspiring to witness a nascent anti-racism movement being born in real time here in Trinidad and Tobago, once again brought about by the activism of tireless African Americans. Although a country that boasts multiculturalism and acceptance, my small island home still faces its fair share of hurdles in freeing us from racism and the legacy of slavery.\n\nAs #BlackOutTuesday - a call for Black Americans to show strength in dollars by not purchasing goods for 24 hours - took hold on June 2 , Trinidadians called for the boycott of businesses owned by men who made racist remarks about Black people in the wake of George Floyd's death. Black entrepreneurs also pulled their products from the store's shelves and many began circulating lists of Black-owned enterprises on social media. On June 8 , more than 500 people showed up to protest in front of the United States Embassy in the country's capital, Port of Spain. It was the second protest in a few days where Trinidadians took a stand in solidarity with #BlackLivesMatter.\n\nIt's become clear that what started as a hashtag movement has now morphed into a worldwide phenomenon, and we cannot even begin to assess the scope of the impact it will have on global politics and political ideology. Black Lives Matter is now a cry heard around the world that has prompted response and action from global citizens in a way that hasn't been seen since the 1960s civil rights era. Protests in each country have taken on different issues, but at their core they represent the struggle against white supremacy across the world.\n\nIt's not so different from what happened half a century ago when mass protests across America led to political gains for African Americans, like the passage of voting rights laws and the end of Jim Crow. Similar to Black Lives Matter, the influence of the movement for Black rights in America was not confined to its borders. The ideologies of Black liberation, peaceful protest, and the fight to secure Black rights spread across the world, inspiring global political change.\n\nIt is within this context that Ghana became the first African nation to gain its freedom in March 1957, a political victory heralded with celebrations attended by Martin Luther King Jr. In 1963, a young Black British social worker named Paul Stephenson employed the bus boycott tactics of Martin Luther King Jr. to desegregate Bristol Omnibus Co., forcing the company to hire Black and Asian bus drivers. In the same decade, various Black Caribbean nations emancipated themselves from European colonialism - including Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica, which both won their independence from British rule in 1962, followed by Barbados (1966), Bahamas (1973), Grenada (1974), Dominica (1978) and so on.\n\nThe plain fact is that the momentum of the civil rights era certainly created the climate for change all around the world, and the same rings true of Black Lives Matter today. In Johannesburg, South Africa, 100 protesters disrupted thoroughfare in front of the US consulate when they knelt in the street for 8 minutes and 46 seconds - the length of time the Minneapolis police officer had his knee on the neck of George Floyd. Another march to the US Embassy was joined by the partner of Collins Khosa, a Black South African man who died after soldiers beat him during the country's lockdown to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Residents of a poor Nairobi, Kenya, district held Black Lives Matter -inspired protests to call attention to their own plight with police violence, where at least 15 people were killed by police after the country imposed curfews to contain the spread of Covid-19, according to the Independent Policing Oversight Authority (IPOA).\n\nFor Europeans, the emergence of Black Lives Matter has forced many across the continent to grapple with its ugly history of racism. In Bristol, UK, protesters dumped a statue of Edward Colston, a 17th-century slave trader, into the nearby River Avon. Though decried by Prime Minister Boris Johnson as a \"criminal act,\" many Britons have heralded the final demise of the statue as \"necessary,\" after years of cries demanding its removal and the removal of Colston's name from public buildings fell on deaf ears. In Belgium, a statue of King Leopold II was taken down and rehomed after sustaining damage from protesters who vandalized and burned the monument. Leopold's colonial regime claimed the lives of millions of Congolese people who were tortured by the Belgian king at the turn of the 20th century.\n\nMeanwhile, in Brazil , an anti-racist and anti-facist rally was held in solidarity with Black Lives Matter that also called attention to the country's own problem with police brutality. In 2019, 1,810 people were reportedly killed by cops in Rio de Janeiro. Australians also used the moment to protest against the deaths of Aboriginals while in police custody.\n\nWhen I left America and moved to Trinidad and Tobago, I wanted a life free of the systemic racism where I grew up. My life is better here - I don't worry about constant police harassment. I walk through my neighborhood with my children and am surrounded by people of color.\n\nBut these protests are a reminder of the fact that no matter where I live, there is still plenty of work that has to be done in order to rid this world of racist hate. Yet where there is global white supremacy, there is also global resistance.\n\nTiffanie Drayton is a freelance writer.

A new study, one of the first to make a rigorous academic attempt to answer that question, found that the protests have had a notable impact on police killings. For every 4,000 people who participated in a Black Lives Matter protest between 2014 and 2019, police killed one less person.\n\nTravis Campbell, a PhD student in economics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, released his preliminary findings on the Social Science Research network as a preprint , meaning the study has yet to receive a formal peer review.\n\nWhile Campbell's research does not encompass the events of summer 2020, George Floyd's killing and the subsequent wave of protests became potentially the largest movement in American history , the sudden growth of which relied on a wave of anger and grief at the police homicides Americans are continually greeted with on the news. Opinion columnists , activists , lawmakers , and even the president of the United States ( current and former ) have weighed in on these protests and what the appropriate policy changes should be. But first, it's important to grapple with how the protests have already changed policing.\n\nFrom 2014 to 2019, Campbell tracked more than 1,600 BLM protests across the country, largely in bigger cities, with nearly 350,000 protesters. His main finding is a 15 to 20 percent reduction in lethal use of force by police officers - roughly 300 fewer police homicides - in census places that saw BLM protests.\n\nCampbell's research also indicates that these protests correlate with a 10 percent increase in murders in the areas that saw BLM protests. That means from 2014 to 2019, there were somewhere between 1,000 and 6,000 more homicides than would have been expected if places with protests were on the same trend as places that did not have protests. Campbell's research does not include the effects of last summer's historic wave of protests because researchers do not yet have all the relevant data.\n\nIt's worth noting that Campbell didn't subject the homicide findings to the same battery of statistical tests as he did the police killings since they were not the main focus of his research. (He intends to do more research on how these protests affected crime rates.) But his research on homicides aligns with other evidence. Omar Wasow, a professor at Princeton University who has done seminal research on the effect of protests, told Vox that the results are \"entirely plausible\" and \"not surprising,\" considering existing protest research.\n\nThe reasons for this rise in murders are not fully known, but one possible explanation is that police morale drops following scrutiny, leading officers to reduce their efforts and thereby emboldening criminals. Another is that members of the public voluntarily withdraw from engagements with the police after a police homicide delegitimizes the justice system in their eyes. (More on this below.)\n\nProtests can do a lot. They can raise awareness, create solidarity or undermine existing relationships, change public opinion, strengthen or weaken institutions, and affect the outcome of elections. But, according to this study, BLM protests also produce their intended effect.\n\nIt's important to understand how Campbell conducted his research and the potential pitfalls when trying to quantify and isolate how protests can affect policy. Researchers who study crime, police lethal force, and protests are hampered by something out of their control: The underlying data can be faulty.\n\nFor lethal force data, there's no federal database to turn to. Instead, Campbell and other researchers have to rely on nonprofit- and media-collected data, which has some drawbacks. This means Campbell may be missing some police homicides in his research.\n\nHarvard University sociologist Joscha Legewie told Scientific American that the study's design is \"'very well suited' for the kind of data Campbell\" is looking at.\n\nAdditionally, there could be something systematically different about the places that have BLM protests that make them more poised for increased police accountability than places without. For instance, a new mayor or district attorney who championed police reform gets elected and then protest movements mobilize to ensure their desired reforms are implemented.\n\nTo account for this problem, Campbell controls for various factors - from the localities' unemployment rate to the Democratic vote share in the 2008 presidential election - to try to make sure he is isolating the effect of BLM protests on police homicides and other murders. But, unless you're able to conduct a randomized controlled trial (which is impossible for studies like these), there could always be hidden variables that researchers are unable to account for.\n\nTo try to further prove his findings are sound, Campbell also shows that before 2014 there were almost parallel trends of police homicides in both the places that would go on to see protests and places that wouldn't. That suggests that what changed in 2014 and beyond - regarding both the reduction in police homicides and the increase in murder - is likely the effect of the BLM protests, not some other hidden variable.\n\nCampbell notes that \"BLM did not transform into the protests movement it is known as today until the police killings of Eric Garner in New York City and Michael Brown in Ferguson, MO in 2014,\" which is why he begins his research with that year.\n\nThe major finding in the paper is that places with BLM protests experienced a statistically significant decline in police homicides. Further, the biggest declines are when protests are relatively large and/or frequent.\n\nCampbell also observes that, over time, the gap in police homicide rates widens between places with and without protests. In year zero, he finds a 13 percent drop in police homicides; by year four, that decline expands by 14 percentage points. That means it's likely that the effect of BLM protests is strong enough to lower the number of police homicides for several years.\n\nCampbell believes there are three potential mechanisms that could have led to this decline, none of which are mutually exclusive.\n\nFirst, he observed an increase in the use of body cameras and different types of community policing. It's possible that, in response to BLM protests, police departments implemented reforms that reduced lethal use of force. Campbell's research finds a significant increase in the likelihood of an agency obtaining body-worn cameras (55.3 percent), patrol officers within a designated geographic area (20.6 percent), and SARA officers, a type of community policing (57.5 percent).\n\nThe existing literature on body cameras is mixed , though, undercutting the idea that widespread body camera use alone is the driving force behind declining instances of police brutality.\n\nA Brookings Institution expert explained that while randomized trials \"in American and European police departments found that body worn camera's reduced the number of complaints filed by local residents against the police ... they showed mixed effects on use of force by and against police officers.\" In a major 2017 study conducted in Washington, DC, the researchers found that \"the behavior of officers who wore cameras all the time was indistinguishable from the behavior of those who never wore cameras.\"\n\nOne bright spot in the research on body cameras is a recent job market paper by University of Chicago economics researcher Taeho Kim; the nationwide study found that the use of these cameras reduced police-involved homicides by 43 percent.\n\nAs for other elements of this possible explanation, the research is less clear. Campbell writes that the lethal force impact of expanding community policing and patrols is \"understudied,\" but activists have frequently called for community policing in response to instances of police brutality.\n\nWasow explained that it may not be the specific reforms per se but that the increase of administrative or training changes indicates more people are taking accountability seriously within the justice system. Accountability culture is hard to measure, so researchers can observe it in an uptick in measures like body-worn cameras or community policing. If this is true, police reform may have less to do with specific policies than just an increased commitment to holding officers to a higher standard.\n\nThe second mechanism is that civilians are becoming more wary of the police in the aftermath of these protests and the publicizing of instances of police homicides. That could mean people call 911 less or engage with police officers less of their own volition, which has the effect of reducing civilian/police interactions and thereby fatal interactions as well.\n\nFinally, the third mechanism is something called the Ferguson effect: the supposition that protests against police brutality reduce officer morale and effort due to the \"intensified scrutiny from the community and media.\" In other words, officers stop doing their jobs as aggressively. This can lead to reduced arrests, especially for less serious crimes like disorderly conduct or marijuana possession.\n\nDeepak Premkumar, a research fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California, found in recently released research that police do reduce their efforts following officer-involved fatalities: Theft arrests fall by 7 percent, and for \"quality of life crimes\" like disorderly conduct or marijuana possession, arrests decline by up to 23 percent (weed possession alone declines by up to 33 percent).\n\nIt's these latter two mechanisms that could explain the increase in murder following BLM protests.\n\nThis is where things get more speculative. Campbell's study finds that BLM protests correlate with a 10 percent increase in murder. That is, there were a few thousand more homicides in the places where there were BLM protests than would have been expected if those places followed the same trends as the ones that didn't see protests.\n\nWe don't know why BLM protests correlated with an increase in the murder rate, and there's not a lot of research in this space to help guide us. Additionally, Campbell's research question was focused on the effect of BLM protests on police homicides, so these other observed changes regarding other homicides were not subjected to the same robustness tests.\n\nA number of factors could be driving the increase. Premkumar, who studied the Ferguson effect, also observed a \"significant rise\" (10 to 17 percent) in murders and robberies following highly publicized officer-involved fatalities.\n\nBut from talking with experts, there are a few ways we can understand what may be happening here.\n\nFirst, it's possible criminal activity rises in areas that have seen protests because people stop calling the police or working with them out of fear or anger - thereby emboldening criminal behavior. Moreover, some experts believe people will try to resolve their disputes extrajudicially if the system loses legitimacy following a police homicide.\n\nIf this were happening, we would expect to see a reduction in the reported rates of low-level crime - fewer low-level crimes would be reported relative to high-level crimes like murders. Murders are less likely to go unnoticed because, well, there's a missing person and/or a body. So the murder rate is usually the best indicator of what's actually going on with crime writ large.\n\nCampbell observes a significant increase in the murder rate but a simultaneous 8.4 percent decrease in total property crimes reported. That is consistent with people voluntarily reducing interactions with the police, and other criminologists are in favor of this explanation. However, research by Michael Zoorob, a PhD student at Harvard University, finds that \"across a large number of cities, incidents, and analytic strategies well-publicized brutality incidents do not reduce 911 calls to report common property or violent crimes,\" casting doubt on the idea that police homicides reduce voluntary civilian engagement with police.\n\nOne other possible explanation for the increased murder rate is that law enforcement officials are the ones voluntarily reducing their interactions with the community and as a result emboldening criminal activity. One way to observe whether police are reducing their efforts is to see whether the share of property crimes cleared falls over this period. In other words, are police not trying as hard - either because they are demoralized or angry at public scrutiny of their behavior - to solve low-level crimes that are reported to them? Campbell observes a 5.5 percent decline in the share of property crimes cleared, which is consistent with police reducing their efforts immediately following the protests.\n\nThe good news is that even if Campbell's finding about the increase in murders following BLM protests holds up to further scrutiny, the effect doesn't appear to last for long. By year four, Campbell no longer observes a statistically significant increase in murders, indicating that whatever is going on with murders is hopefully not long term.\n\nNone of Campbell's data covers the protests in 2020 or the rise in murders in 2020 . As German Lopez explains for Vox, \"some experts have cited the protests this summer over the police killings of George Floyd and others,\" but Covid-19 made the year so unusual that experts are cautious about drawing any conclusions yet.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nAn exhausting - if not exhaustive - timeline of J.K.

They stand out as notably larger and more widespread than other protests against racist killings in recent years as the Black Lives Matter movement has gained visibility. Over the past month, marches have taken place in more than 40 countries and 2,000 American cities , compared with 100 US cities in 2013 following the acquittal of George Zimmerman for the killing of Black teen Trayvon Martin.\n\nPerhaps most striking is that this time, in the middle of a pandemic , there were more white participants than in previous Black Lives Matter protests. \"It felt like I needed to do more than just try to make change through my teaching,\" Tim, a 27-year-old white teacher in Seattle, told Vox. (Names have been changed throughout to protect the anonymity of the protesters.)\n\nThere is no simple answer as to why this moment has tipped the scales of activism and anti-racist action. But as Vox's Sean Collins pointed out, the US has also hit an \" exasperation point \" in the pandemic: \"The realities of illness, unemployment, polluted air and water, unequal access to education, and mass incarceration - compounded with the fear of being killed by one of your fellow Americans or by a mysterious and still unchecked disease - has life feeling particularly fragile and the world particularly dire,\" Collins wrote .\n\nIt's hard to say how long this surge in activism will last, or what it will look like going forward. But it feels like a new sense of responsibility among white allies and non-Black people of color has risen to the surface, at least for the time being. For some, this has translated to reading books about anti-racism . For others, it means attending protests for the first time in their lives. And yet systemic racism has been ingrained in the fabric of America since its founding , police violence against Black Americans dates back to when slavery was legal , and the Black Lives Matter movement has existed since 2013. Why did they choose to get involved now? And will their activism sustain past the current moment?\n\nWe spoke to five first-time protesters on what brought them out onto the streets and how they intend to sustain their activism.\n\nVidya, 24, Stony Brook , New York\n\nVidya's father was the first in her family to decide it was time to attend a protest. After viewing multiple videos that depicted instances of police brutality, he was inspired to get involved.\n\n\"I don't know if he's felt very strongly about social issues in the past, but something, like, really clicked for him this time, and he thought it was just disgusting and said we need to go out and let them know it's not okay,\" Vidya said.\n\nVidya also realized that being a passive supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement was simply not enough. Her younger sister found a protest in their neighborhood on Instagram that a lot of people were sharing, and her family prepared at the last minute to go. They brought personal protective equipment (PPE), made signs with Sharpies and cardboard, and drove five minutes from their home to the protest.\n\nInitially, Vidya said she felt out of place among a crowd of young people who seemed to know each other. But that changed quickly as she took in the energy of the crowd and grew excited.\n\n\"I'm actually part of a community of people who are trying to do something,\" she said.\n\nVidya, who is Indian, said her neighborhood lacks racial diversity - Stony Brook is 81.8 percent white - and that she did not expect people to care so much: \"I was really, really surprised by the amount of people who turned out and how diverse the crowd was,\" she said, noting that it was inspiring to see a lot of middle-aged people support the cause.\n\nYears ago, Vidya said, she felt that the Black Lives Matter movement was \"kind of polarizing.\" She remembers in high school that people were not politically attuned, describing her town as \"removed from reality.\" Even before she attended the Black Lives Matter protest, Vidya feared that protesting would feel \"useless\" or like she didn't belong, which is part of why she did not attend major events like the Women's March in 2017. Now she feels more inclined to participate, and perhaps get involved with a register to vote effort.\n\n\"The really big thing was it's just not enough to just feel like I support the cause,\" she said. \"You need to donate, you need to show up for it, you need to speak up in your personal sphere for it also because it is uncomfortable.\"\n\nStephen, 29, Chattanooga, Tennessee\n\nStephen, who's white, grew up in Jackson, Alabama, a town with a population of around 5,000. It was a \"very sheltered white environment,\" he said. It also wasn't uncommon to hear older people in town say the n-word. His family attended a Southern Baptist church every Sunday and Wednesday, and at one point, his mother worked there.\n\nStephen said is family would be surprised to know that he participated in the Black Lives Matter protests. \"I know they do not agree at all with my views, so they would probably be pretty disappointed to know that I'm trying to be out there and supportive,\" he said.\n\nWhile Stephen said he has tried to stay educated in recent years on how to be an anti-racist, he felt like he needed to get involved by showing up at a protest this time. Initially he was concerned about protesting - his wife is a nurse, and they're trying to limit their exposure to the coronavirus - but they ultimately decided that they needed to show their support.\n\nStephen said that as he protested, his \"chest was tight\" and his \"eyes were burning with tears.\" \"Honestly, I've never really experienced anything like that,\" he said. \"I didn't expect just, like, the surge of emotion and adrenaline and anger.\"\n\nSince the protests began, he has become more aware of city budgets and limited resources for Black and brown communities in Chattanooga. He said he has also been making an effort to read more work by Black authors and journalists. A friend of his started a Zoom book club, and they're reading Ibram X. Kendi's How to Be an Antiracist.\n\n\"This time feels so different and like such a tipping point in our nation,\" Stephen said. \"I know that the Black and brown communities across our country are not new to this, and this is not a new struggle for them or a new awareness for them, but I think this time is different because of the more involvement from the white communities.\"\n\nPaco, 30, Minneapolis, Minnesota\n\nOriginally from Honduras, Paco attended a protest for the first time in the US after the video of George Floyd's murder surfaced online.\n\n\"The video was a call to action that was very profound,\" he said. \"Staying at home was just not an option.\"\n\nPaco lives near a heavily trafficked street in Minneapolis, where a lot of damage occurred after some of the initial demonstrations. He could hear protesters from his home and saw people boarding up their windows, which made it easy for him to figure out where the protests were happening.\n\nBeing at the protests filled him with mixed emotions: He was pleased by the diversity of the protesters but filled with anger at the situation. \"It was also very upsetting just that people had to be out there because the Minneapolis police killed this man,\" he said.\n\nSince protesting, Paco has started volunteering as a Spanish translator for food pantry customers; after supermarkets were destroyed in the protests, some neighborhoods have become food deserts .\n\nPaco wants to attend a protest again. The civil unrest in the US right now reminds Paco of what he described as a \"non-learning cycle\" in Latin America, where he said there is a broken system because people keep voting for the same kinds of corrupt politicians.\n\n\"They keep making the same mistakes because they don't look back at their history,\" he said. \"I hope that we don't forget about this and go back to normal life.\"\n\nTim, 27, Seattle, Washington\n\nTim said he has always cared about racial justice issues. As a middle-school teacher, he tries to integrate racism into his classroom discussions. But following the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, he recognized that as a white person, that was not enough.\n\n\"It felt like I needed to do more than just try to make change through my teaching,\" he said.\n\nAt a faculty meeting, the principal of Tim's school, a Black woman, urged faculty to do something to support the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\n\"There was a protest later that day that some of my friends were going to, and I just felt that I had to physically show up at that point,\" he said.\n\nDuring the Seattle protest Tim attended, around 10,000 protesters marched down to City Hall, where a local organizer sat down with the mayor for a livestreamed conversation. The scale of the protest was surprising to him. Because of the pandemic, the protest was the first time he had been around a large group of people in months, and it felt empowering for this cause to be the reason.\n\nSince this first protest, Tim has spent time trying to learn about the best places to donate money locally, as well as educating himself on police budgets and what defunding really looks like. In the past, he had been hesitant to attend protests because he did not know what impact he would have. But supporting a local organizer and seeing the crowd try to hold the mayor accountable changed his mind.\n\n\"It felt like, really, we were directly there backing policy change,\" Tim said, \"which felt cool to me.\"\n\nGina, 43, Sunnyvale, California\n\nGina and her husband, who are both white, felt that they needed to educate their kids - 8 and 12 - on what's going on right now. Her older son saw the murder of George Floyd on the news, which sparked a family conversation about police brutality and systemic racism. That's when they decided to attend a protest as a family.\n\n\"With everything happening, we felt that it was important to help them understand the importance of speaking up for others and to model what peaceful action looks like,\" Gina said.\n\nGina and her husband coordinated with other families who have children around the same age and decided to participate in a peaceful protest organized by students from their local high school: \"After we told them what happened, we discussed how we felt that it's important to speak up for people who don't have a voice or don't feel like they're being heard,\" she said. They first found out about the protest through a flyer that was circulated on a neighborhood forum.\n\n\"It was surreal. It was emotional for me to hear stories of others, to have my children participate in something that is a moment in history, to teach them what it means to have a voice, and to hear others who haven't been heard for so long,\" Gina said.\n\nBut learning doesn't begin and end with one protest.

      "text": "How to argue with your family about: Black Lives Matter\n\nBy: Dara Lind\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement has been in the news almost constantly throughout 2015, such as when activists confronted Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail or protested in the streets of Baltimore after the death of Freddie Gray in police custo dy this spring. But it's been in the news indirectly, too, because the rise of the movement (especially after the killing of unarmed black teen Michael Brown by a police officer last summer) has turned national attention not just to other similar cases but to bigger problems of implicit bias and entrenched racism in American life, from universities to sports media .\n\nThe movement has been blamed for inciting violence against police, courted by presidential candidates, and pretty much everything in between. And at Thanksgiving, someone will say likely something about it that will make you want to roll your eyes. But don't do that. Here's what you should say instead.\n\nHer confusion is understandable; media outlets often do present \"black lives matter\" and \"all lives matter\" as opposing slogans. Even at the first Democratic debate, a young black questioner really did ask the candidates to choose: \"Do black lives matter, or do all lives matter?\" â reinforcing the very misconception the questioner was (presumably) trying to fix.\n\nIf your sister-in-law enjoys sarcastic humor, she might appreciate some of the explanations-by-analogy various people on the Internet have cooked up âÂ this \"all houses matter\" comic , for example. The most direct explanation I've found, though, is that the implication of \"black lives matter\" is \"black lives matter, too. \"\n\nBlack Lives Matter activists feel that (for example) the frequency with which law enforcement officers kill black Americans, and the circumstances of those deaths , is evidence that police don't care enough about black lives to protect them as much as white ones. All lives matter, but black lives are under more of a threat. So they think the explicit reminder is necessary.\n\nYour sister-in-law might have seen someone get very upset (or had someone get upset at her!) for saying, \"All lives matter.\" Let her know that people opposed to the Black Lives Matter movement have co - opted the slogan and hashtag \"#AllLivesMatter\" on social media â and it's often used to express straightforwardly racist beliefs. That's why it leaves such a bad taste in activists' mouths.\n\nLay out some basic facts. America is safer than it's been in decades. Violent crime is still on a 24-year decline . Attacks on police officers are still incredibly rare. Only 51 police officers were \"feloniously killed\" in 2014 â despite the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nBut your uncle has probably seen news stories of attacks on police, some of which â like the killing of Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu in New York City last December â were carried out by people who claimed they were avenging the deaths of black men at the hands of police officers. There haven't been many of these \"revenge\" attacks, but that hasn't stopped some police from feeling that they're under siege (and in some cases, doing less to protect communities as a result ).\n\nIt might be interesting to talk to your uncle about the way society treats people who commit high-profile murders or attacks â from the man who killed Officers Ramos and Liu to the man whoÂ killed nine black parishioners at Charleston's historic Emmanuel Baptist Church in June to the man who killed two television reporters on camera this summer.\n\nIn all of those cases, the killers said that their actions were driven by their political beliefs. In all of those cases, the killers had some other indication of mental illness or distress. When is it appropriate to ignore someone's political ideology and attribute violence to mental illness? Since white attackers tend to be more likely to get treated as mentally ill individuals rather than as politically motivated terrorists , is the right answer to treat more attackers of color as mentally ill, or is the answer to hold more white attackers accountable for their beliefs?\n\nThe best answer to this is that, for the most part, the media really has been covering the movement. Killings by police routinely become national news. Two different mainstream publications â the Guardian and the Washington Post â have taken it upon themselves to tally every killing by a police officer in 2015 (data the FBI still doesn't collect ).\n\nBlack Lives Matter activists' demands of presidential candidates have been one of the major stories of the Democratic primary campaign. And perhaps most importantly, the movement has helped make a lot of people, including reporters, more sensitive to embedded racism in institutions generally (including their own).\n\nImplicit in that, of course, is that the media has historically not been great in covering racial injustice. So it makes sense that people might be distrustful.\n\nThe good news for people who distrust traditional media is that social media â especially Twitter â has become an alternative news ecosystem. You don't need to read newspapers anymore to find out what's going on.\n\nBut it can be very hard to correct errors on social-media-driven news, or keep them from spreading. When you can see what's happening everywhere around the country at once, it can be easy to think you're watching a national trend â like a series of fires at black churches this summer â when in fact the events are totally separate and random. Having a check on that impulse, whether it's coming from a professional media outlet or somewhere else, is always useful.\n\nUltimately, though, there will always be people who claim that the media \"isn't covering\" a story , even when they found out about it through the media. It makes people feel good to think they care more about important issues than the average person and that they've liberated themselves from the conventional media that warps everyone else's minds. Maybe you can start a conversation with your sister about where she gets her news and compare her media diet with that of another family member. Are there news stories she hasn't heard about?"

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nAt the presidential debate, Trump continued to use rhetoric that will only make tensions worse.\n\nby German Lopez\n\nIn the months of Black Lives Matter protests following the death of George Floyd in May, President Donald Trump has called on local and state officials to crack down as harshly as possible - a call he repeated at Tuesday's presidential debate. But experts say that Trump's rhetoric and actions risk inflaming tensions and escalating protests further, instead of keeping the peace.\n\nTrump has characterized the protests as violent, even though more than 90 percent of thousands of protests nationwide have been peaceful . He's dismissed protesters' concerns, promising to \"DEFEND OUR POLICE\" rather than pursue policing reforms. He's refused to criticize a vigilante shooter who killed two demonstrators and was charged with murder.\n\nTrump has saved his harshest criticisms for local leaders he claims are too soft on the demonstrations. He's called cities like Portland, Oregon, where protests have gone on for months and at times gotten violent, \"a mess,\" claiming Portland and other cities are \"weakly run by Radical Left Democrat Governors and Mayors!\" He sent federal agents to harass and arrest protesters in Portland and other cities. All of this escalated last month as the Trump administration declared New York City, Portland, and Seattle \"anarchist cities,\" setting them up to potentially lose federal funds.\n\nHe again used this kind of rhetoric at Tuesday's presidential debate: \"If we would send in the National Guard, it would be over.\" (Governors in states where riots broke out have, in fact, sent in the National Guard.)\n\nSome Republican leaders are taking cues from Trump. Last month, for example, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis proposed changes that would escalate penalties for riots, block state funding for cities that \"defund the police,\" and stiffen penalties for protesters who hit a police officer during a \"disorderly assembly,\" Politico reported .\n\nBut if the goal is ensuring that protesters can exercise their First Amendment rights while avoiding the outbreaks of violence seen in Portland; Kenosha, Wisconsin; and other cities in the US this past summer, the confrontational, dismissive approach that Trump and his allies are taking will very likely make things worse, experts say.\n\nThe point of protests is for people to feel heard. Demonstrators are marching in the streets because they want to say something, and they want others - the public, politicians, and so on - to see and hear those messages.\n\n\"When we look at where protests are flaring up, they're flaring up in response to incidents of [police] brutality,\" Erica Chenoweth, an expert at Harvard on protests and political violence, told me. \"So the No. 1 thing is to just make those instances of brutality stop.\"\n\nIn the moment, government officials who want to keep peace at protests, including the police, should take steps that don't just protect protesters' and the public's safety but also their rights to speak out and demonstrate.\n\nIf law enforcement acts indiscriminately - by, say, tear-gassing everyone - that risks escalating the situation, fostering a sense among protesters that their rights to free speech and assembly are being suppressed even though they did nothing wrong.\n\nThat's especially true when it's the police's own actions that are the subject of protests. By behaving in a way that may validate protesters' concerns about excessive use of force and police brutality more broadly, the cops only heighten tensions further.\n\n\"If an authority figure exerts some type of control or dominance or power that's perceived to be unjustified, what that does is then trigger a psychological process where [protesters] now have a common enemy,\" Tamara Herold, director of the Crowd Management Research Council at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, told me. \"And that can actually escalate violence.\"\n\nProtests can be calmed as long as people feel heard, and if they can peacefully practice their legal rights to free speech and assembly. Break that - with inflammatory presidential rhetoric or blanket tear-gassing of largely peaceful crowds - and violence is more likely to break out.\n\nThe goal of the government's response to any protest should be to ensure that people feel heard and can express their opinions, while still protecting the broader public if things get out of control.\n\nThe problem is this is easier said than done.\n\n\"There's a million factors that can affect the outcome that will impact how you approach, from weather conditions ... to the time of day to the demographics of the protesters to where you are,\" Herold said. \"There are no easy answers.\"\n\nOne method is meeting with the protest organizers to set the terms of engagement - what's known as \"negotiated management.\" The terms have to be reasonable, and the police should try to avoid taking sides. In doing this, police can set expectations, so it's less surprising if they, say, have to suddenly move into a crowd to arrest someone. At the same time, this also can help protesters know what they have to avoid and potentially self-police to keep the peace.\n\nThis model, however, has fallen out of favor with many police departments since the 1990s as protests have become less organized and hierarchical, at times leaving no one for the police to actually meet. That's led more police to move toward a model of \"strategic incapacitation,\" in which they try to contain protests and target only those who are acting out violently.\n\nWhat that looks like: \"Whenever we can, facilitate the constitutional rights of protesters who are protesting peacefully and not causing harm,\" Herold said. \"At the same time, quickly and efficiently as possible address those individuals who are causing harm. And you have to be very focused when it comes to that.\"\n\nAgain, that can be difficult. If several protesters are throwing bottles, rocks, and bricks at police from within an otherwise largely peaceful crowd, officers have a decision to make: They can forcefully move in to nab the wrongdoers (putting themselves at risk), they can try to disperse the crowd (an indiscriminate action that will affect peaceful protesters), or they can back off (which can risk letting violence, such as rioting or property damage, spiral out of control as it's unsupervised). Coordination with protesters can make this easier, but that's only likely if the police earn protesters' cooperation.\n\nPolice can make these situations more difficult too, particularly if they take an aggressive stance against protesters - by, for instance, donning militarized equipment like long guns and body armor, as departments around the country did in response to this past summer's protests.\n\n\"Most of the escalatory dynamics take place when, at least in authoritarian regimes, agents of the state turn out prepared for and engage in active repression,\" Chenoweth said. \"That's always going to trigger escalation.\"\n\nVideos from earlier this year showed police cracking down on the protests with excessive and indiscriminate force, like when New York City cops rammed vehicles into protesters , Dallas officers tear-gassed peaceful demonstrations , Buffalo police shoved a 75-year-old man to the ground , and federal agents beat a military veteran in Portland.\n\nBased on the research, aggressive police behavior this summer wasn't abnormal. A 2016 study by researcher Heidi Reynolds-Stenson, looking at protests from 1960 to 1995, found police are more likely to act aggressively against police brutality protests than they are against other kinds of demonstrations - showing up twice as often and taking action, from arrests to use of force, almost 40 percent more often.\n\nIn short: Police act more aggressively when they're the target of protests. As Herold put it, \"When you are the target of the protests, it certainly changes the dynamic of what happens at these events.\"\n\nBut experts emphasized that the authorities should still try to acknowledge the protesters' concerns, even if they feel wrongly attacked or criticized. Some police chiefs already do this following a police shooting or killing - saying the incident is being investigated or, in the case of George Floyd's death in Minneapolis, describing what the officer did as a \"murder.\" Other departments have tried to avoid a confrontational stance, either ditching the riot gear or kneeling with protesters in an attempt to make it clear the demonstrators' concerns are heard.\n\n\"Perception matters,\" Herold said. \"The specific tactics that the officers use influences that perception, so it matters a great deal - everything from the way officers are dressed to the equipment deployed to the way directives are being issued. All of those things matter.\"\n\nIf protesters feel that their attempts at peaceful demonstrations are being or have been unfairly shut down, they're more likely to get aggressive.\n\n\"Police need to understand their role in the relationship dynamic with crowds,\" Ed Maguire, a criminal justice expert at Arizona State University, told me. \"Each act on their part that is perceived by the crowd as aggressive or escalatory will result in the crowd escalating. The goal is to ensure that police do everything possible on their side not to escalate conflict unnecessarily.\"\n\nWhile specific tactics can work in the moment to prevent largely peaceful protests from getting out of control, the way forward, in the long term, is to actually address the issues protesters are raising. In many circumstances, the situation that leads to violence doesn't bubble up solely in the hours or moments before that violence breaks out.\n\nProtests don't solely react or escalate based on what's happening right in front of them. They're influenced by all sorts of factors: what public officials are saying about them at the time; whether their actions are leading to significant social, cultural, or legal changes; the historical issues surrounding their grievances; and so on.\n\nIn some cases, riots and looting are really just people taking advantage of chaos to make a quick buck. But these acts of violence are also often rooted in genuine grievances about a social issue.\n\nIf protesters feel like they or people like them have been saying the same thing for decades, and no one has listened, there's a chance they will be more aggressive and even violent. As Martin Luther King Jr. put it , \"A riot is the language of the unheard.\"\n\nThis is an issue at any Black Lives Matter protest. Systemic racism has been a part of the US for centuries, and the issue of police brutality, specifically, has led to generations of protests and riots over police abuse against Black people going back to the 1960s and before.\n\nYet in all this time, minority communities' grievances with the police - that they're simultaneously too oppressive but do little to solve serious crimes - haven't been resolved. That leads to frustration and anger, which in turn can lead to more aggressive and violent acts of civil unrest.\n\nThe protesters' concerns have been repeatedly validated by federal investigations. The Justice Department's report on the Baltimore Police Department in 2016 noted when a police shift commander created an arrest form for loitering on public housing, he didn't even try to hide his racist expectations. In the template, there was no space to fill in gender or race. Instead, that information was automatically filled out: \"black male.\"\n\nThe report found that Black people in Baltimore were much more likely to be stopped than their white counterparts even after controlling for population. One Black man in his mid-50s was stopped 30 times in less than four years - nearly one stop a month - despite never receiving a citation or criminal charge.\n\n\"Racially disparate impact is present at every stage of BPD's enforcement actions, from the initial decision to stop individuals on Baltimore streets to searches, arrests, and uses of force,\" the report concluded. \"These racial disparities, along with evidence suggesting intentional discrimination, erode the community trust that is critical to effective policing.\"\n\nThis is not something the Justice Department found only in Baltimore. It's appeared again and again: Whether it's Baltimore, Cleveland , New Orleans , Ferguson , or Chicago , the Justice Department has found horrific constitutional violations in how police use force, how they target minority residents, how they stop and ticket people, and just about every other aspect of policing.\n\nNone of this justifies the damage and harm that riots and general violence do. (And the research suggests riots can backfire politically.) But if you want to stop people from rioting, you have to understand the issues that led people to riot in the first place.\n\n\"It's a huge country, and these are really complex issues,\" Chenoweth said. \"It's not easy.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Trump is basically doing the opposite of what experts recommend to calm tense demonstrations.\n\nHe's ignored or outright rejected protesters' main concerns about systemic racism. When asked about police killing Black people, Trump responded , \"What a terrible question to ask. So are white people. More white people, by the way.\" (When considering population, Black people are disproportionately killed by police , far more than white people.)\n\nTrump sent federal agents to Portland. The agents were indiscriminate in their actions, going after attendees both peaceful and not with tear gas, rubber bullets, and arrests. That led to nights of violence and chaos in the city, calming down only after the feds left .\n\nTrump has even justified violence when it wasn't perpetuated by Black Lives Matter protesters. After a self-identified militia member killed two people at the protests in Kenosha, Wisconsin, and was charged with murder , Trump argued the shooter \"probably would have been killed\" and was acting in self-defense. That seemed to condone vigilante violence against the demonstrations, inflaming tensions on both sides.\n\n\"Unfortunately, President Trump's words routinely escalate conflict and violence rather than calming tensions and reducing these problems,\" Maguire said.\n\nThis, arguably, makes things more difficult for police, too. The rhetoric around Black Lives Matter protests \"is exacerbating the situation that police find themselves in,\" Frank Straub, director of the Center for Mass Violence Response Studies at the Police Foundation, told me. \"It's creating a no-win situation.\" He added, \"If we can get the rhetoric down and the polarization down, we are in a unique period of our history that, with thoughtful, constructive discussion, there's the opportunity to maybe reach some resolutions to these issues or find a collaborative way forward.\"\n\nPerhaps the escalation is intentional. Trump has repeatedly pointed to the protests and chaos in US cities in what seems like an attempt to distract from his failures as president, including his botched handling of the Covid-19 pandemic and the collapsing economy. His campaign for president appears to see the violence as beneficial, speaking to the need for Trump's dog whistle of \"law and order.\"\n\n\"The more chaos and anarchy and vandalism and violence reigns, the better it is for the very clear choice on who's best on public safety and law and order,\" former White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said on Fox News .\n\nThat, of course, ignores that all of this \"chaos and anarchy and vandalism and violence\" is happening under Trump's watch . Yet that hasn't stopped Trump's campaign from blaming Democratic mayors for the violence and using the scenes of protests to claim , in reference to the Democratic presidential candidate, \"You won't be safe in Joe Biden's America.\"\n\nIn this context, maybe the Trump campaign wants to keep the chaos and violence going.\n\nThat'd be straight out of the authoritarian playbook. \"It's almost universal that authoritarian leaders try to foment conflict in these types of conditions,\" Chenoweth said. \"It's really hard for them to manage the use of people power. ... You almost have to give in to make it stop.\" Short of that, Chenoweth explained, authoritarians will try to make peaceful protesters out to be terrorists or coup plotters, and \"infiltrate and provoke movements into using violence\" - and that violence by protesters, at least in countries with strong government institutions, \"almost always favors the incumbent politically.\"\n\nThat seems to be the gamble Trump is now taking: Maybe his actions and rhetoric lead to more violence in the short term, but that's okay if it gets him reelected. The candidate who's claiming that he'll make America safe is now possibly making America less safe to get his most desired wish.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nAn exhausting - if not exhaustive - timeline of J.K.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nTo sustain the current anti-racism movement, look to the past, says professor Megan Ming Francis.\n\nby Fabiola Cineas\n\nWhen protests for black lives erupted across the country in May, the images were inspiring if not surprising: In big cities like Los Angeles, New York, and Washington, DC, protesters filled massive boulevards for miles in the middle of a pandemic . Meanwhile, in small, mostly white towns across the country, hundreds of people gathered to chant \"Black lives matter\" and \"no justice, no peace\" in the middle of the day. It felt like a moment not seen for generations.\n\nNow, weeks later, activists are still organizing marches, whether they're fighting for trans lives , toppling Confederate statues , or calling for the removal of other racist symbols like the Confederate flag. But with the media no longer covering protests well into the night, it can be hard to gauge the strength and popularity of the current marches. And even if people continue to rally in the streets, the question remains: How can activists sustain the momentum that has moved people to question the deep-rooted racism in American systems like policing?\n\nMegan Ming Francis, a political science professor at the University of Washington and a visiting professor at Harvard University, told Vox that there are a few things activists and allies must do to achieve even greater wins through November and in the coming years. These steps involve public education and a greater recognition of how protest shifts public opinion. \"Protest is key,\" she said, but the movement can't end in the street.\n\nAs she points out in her book, Civil Rights and the Making of the Modern American State, the NAACP from 1909 to 1923 mobilized state-building by first shifting public opinion, then creating change within political and legal structures. And according to polls, opinion is already shifting: In 2015, just 51 percent of Americans believed racism is a big problem in the US; now 76 percent of Americans do . Ming Francis also noted how sustaining the movement will require that big philanthropy do more to fund grassroots movements that are Black-led, particularly Black-woman led.\n\nI talked to Francis about the parallels and differences between the modern movement and the NAACP's civil rights efforts in the early 20th century, and the lessons this early movement teaches us about longevity. Our interview has been edited for clarity.\n\nDemonstrations kicked off about a month ago , with people around the country and world taking to the streets to protest the killing of Black people and other ills like systemic racism and police brutality. What about this period seems different to you, if anything, especially in comparison to the early 20th-century movements you study?\n\nI am certain that something feels different this time. It is different from all past movements but particularly different from earlier Black Lives Matter protests from 2014, 2015, and 2016. Initially, when everything popped off, I was like, \"Here we go again. People are going to go for about a day or a week then aren't going to care.\" But then, the endurance and longevity of these protests, the size of these protests - they are inspiring.\n\nIn terms of how big and diverse they are, you get the sense that it's not just Black people. Black people are saying we deserve to live, do not kill us, and that this American democracy does not extend to us. But you're seeing it's not just them that are making this claim. Other people are making this claim, and we know there's strength in numbers. The history of protest in this country is that when there's more people, politicians pay attention. With the Black Lives Matter protests in 2014 and 2015, it wasn't just Republicans but the Democratic establishment also basically gave it lip service, pushed it to the side, and treated protesters like nuisances. But this time it's clear that protests are a force to be reckoned with, and the Democratic establishment needs to wake up and pay attention to what protesters are saying.\n\nRight now what you are hearing in the streets are the feelings, thoughts, pain, rage, and frustrations of the nation - not just a small section of it. It is now clear that a growing number of people are empathetic to Black pain; they are trying to raise that as an issue and believe that we must address it to move forward. These people feel that their own understanding of what it means to be a citizen in this country is not complete because certain people in this country are not treated as full people. It's been interesting, inspiring, and beautiful to watch so many of the protests taking place.\n\nAnd what tangible outcomes have you noticed?\n\nOne of the things I'm seeing that's a testament to the moment we're in in American politics is that people are dreaming and imagining a different way forward, a different type of politics. That is really cool. There are those who have been used to the idea that the way you get change is through democratic politics. That you sign a petition (which is still good), try to get legislation passed, and try to get a court a victory. You try to get reform inside of the institution. But now we see Black people leading the way saying, \"No, we reject that. Your institutions do not work. We can never actually be free and be considered full citizens inside your institution.\" People are imagining new ways to be, with new forms of transparency, accountability, and harm reduction. We are seeing that pop up all over, like with CHAZ in Seattle , Washington. It's an example that a different world is possible. That is what I see as different.\n\nAnd in comparison to movements of the 20th century, what specific comparisons do you draw?\n\nIn terms of what is different about this moment in comparison to the mid-20th century and early 20th century civil rights struggle is I think there is a frustration that is even more urgent than it was in some ways in the '60s. Before the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, there were not yet big pieces of legislation from the government. The federal government had not protected the rights of Black people in this country. So much of the protests were about securing federal protections in the workplace, in housing, and getting rid of Jim Crow - that separate could never be equal.\n\nBut then that falls. Things were supposed to be better. White people were supposed to stop killing Black people. We played by your rules and got the Civil Rights Act in 1964. We also eventually got Obama. Blacks got the highest office in this country and you still kill us. So it doesn't matter if we were the president of this country, you still don't see us as full people. What is different about this moment than in the past is that all of the work and playing by the rules and focusing on electoral politics for change as the main way change happens, that doesn't work anymore. It's clear that you have not just younger Black people, but middle-aged and older Black people who are frustrated and understand that something new needs to happen, that something more transformative needs to happen.\n\n\"The endurance and longevity of these protests, the size of these protests - they are inspiring\"\n\nI'd like to talk more about the idea that this kind of action and urgency is no longer just a \"Black thing.\" What's going on with non-Black people that is making them get involved this time around?\n\nI've thought about this a lot. Why are there so many non-Black people who are suddenly so concerned? I think it's two things. First, it's the layering of the pandemic on top of old-fashioned white supremacy. The pandemic has forced people [to stay] home. They have been having conversations about health and health care, and it has been very clear to people that there is structural inequality in the system. People are open to talking about race a little bit when it comes to matters of health. Everyone has been experiencing a health crisis, so the American public has been primed that there's social inequalities around health. And then the big thing here is: People can't go anywhere! There are no trips, no vacations to be had. No dinner or brunches. There's no real way for them to escape.\n\nAs somebody who teaches Black politics and civil rights in this country, I am always shocked by how much we do not know. Part of the reason why so many white Americans know so little about the Black experience in America is because they choose not to know. It is willful. For white people to not know that Black people are treated a particular way by the police means they are hiding under a rock. Most people have some inkling - whether it's through The Wire or a friend or something that they perhaps saw. They choose not to learn more about it. What's happening now is people are forced to consume social media and the news much more than they had before. For a good number of Americans, who perhaps never really paid that much attention to police brutality and or systemic racism in this country, they have time to listen, read, and think about their own culpability in creating a system where Black lives aren't valued.\n\nOver the past few weeks, we've seen the different ways people take action at the protests. This has led to a conversation about the merits of nonviolence over violence. We have seen less media coverage, particularly cable news media coverage, of the protests once the looting stopped. From what you've observed, what is the role of violence and nonviolence in bringing about reform? Also, is this even a question that we should still be asking?\n\nI think it's a tremendously helpful question. When the protests started taking place, that was a frame or narrative for the media to harp on, like, \"Look! There's nonviolence and violence, and everybody should be nonviolent.\" Then they pointed to a number of civil rights heroes and demonstrations as a way to shame and undermine the protests. I found that harmful and distracting. And it's interesting that they'd focus on the violence of protesters even more than they would focus on the violence of policing over decades in their newsrooms.\n\nIt's been said by many activists, journalists, and scholars that for people to say the only type of acceptable protest is nonviolent protest - that comes from a place of ignorance of the actual full Black freedom struggle in this country. Violence and nonviolence have always existed together at the same time. Anger and rage have always served a useful purpose. Even in fighting for one's life, people want a clean and neat movement. And the thing about rights-making and progress in this country is you can't point me to one movement that has produced and led to a more democratic United States that's been tight and clean. That's just not the way it happens.\n\nIn thinking about the NAACP's civil rights work in the early 20th century, how did they sustain their movement over so many years?\n\nWhat's fascinating is they were a group of Black people in the early 20th century and you can imagine the kind of violent racism there was in this country. This is the importance of the imagination. A lot of people will say, \"Why focus on the imagination and on a Utopian vision?\" Well, that's the only thing that has pushed Black people forward in this country. The civil rights movement in the '60s was impossible until it happened. All these things are impossible until they happen. The NAACP actually imagined a world in which Black people's lives are protected and treated equally. The United States was not protecting Black people's lives - in fact they were lynching people. It was the peak of lynching, and the NAACP was focused on not accepting that fate and organizing to actually end the lynching and mob violence against Black people as well as other rights around voting, education, and housing.\n\n\"For a good number of Americans ... they have time to listen, read, and think about their own culpability in creating a system where Black lives aren't valued\"\n\nSo it sounds like their sheer will to fight injustice and the belief that freedom could be theirs was the foundation for how they sustained their platform and made progress.\n\nYes, and they focus on a number of different areas, which is important for the current protest to think about in terms of what comes next. We constantly hear today that the only thing Black Lives Matter does is protest in the street and that what they need to be doing is trying to change some formal institution. But with the history of the NAACP, they first focused their energy on changing public opinion because they knew that demonstrations in the street and publicizing the deaths and lynching of Black people would do a lot to impact public opinion. They knew they had to change public opinion around members of Congress. They couldn't just go directly to members of Congress. You need public opinion to create formal institutional change. What we know as legal scholars is that the Supreme Court rarely leads; it mostly follows the whims of change in society. If you want legal change, if you want political change, then it means you need to, at the same time or before, shift public opinion. That is crucial.\n\nThe NAACP first focused on that and then they moved inside of politics. It's fascinating because they were unsure of what to do. They try to get statements from President Woodrow Wilson and President Warren G. Harding condemning lynching. Both men eventually do put out statements, but lynching still continues. They also try to pass an anti-lynching bill in Congress. (Yes, it's 2020, and we're still trying!) It passes the House but it dies in committee in the Senate. That didn't work, but they got far and that's tremendous. Then in 1923, they won a landmark criminal procedure case where the Supreme Court basically said you cannot have mob-dominated trials since they violate the due process clause of the 14th Amendment. This is extraordinary. Court wins are always incremental victories; it's not like everything immediately changed. But court precedent is important, and this was the first time in a criminal procedure case that the Supreme Court interfered in a state court trial, on due process grounds, to say that this Jim Crow trial was not done appropriately.\n\nSo what lessons does the early NAACP movement teach us about the power of the current movements and the power to sustain them?\n\nOne, it affirms the importance of the protests. We've seen tremendous changes in public opinion. I didn't think I'd see this kind of thing in my lifetime, that 60 percent of Americans now believe there needs to be transformative, large-scale change in policing. That has led to big changes in the allowance of police unions and policing and school districts ending contracts with the police. And this is in predominantly white areas in some cases. The NAACP affirmed that protests and public opinion work reaches the hearts and minds of Americans.\n\nThe protests are going to fade away, but I don't see that work ending. I think that work is just going to carry over into formal politics. I'm really interested and excited about November in terms of the number of proposals that might be in place in the different cities and towns and states that these protests have touched. It's clear that these protests have struck a chord with people, and that's not going to end in July. One of the things we can learn from the NAACP is to carry that momentum forward and to bring these protests inside of formal politics.\n\nYou also explore movement funding in your work. What can you say about funders in this moment and how they're working to help sustain the movement going forward?\n\nWhat's exciting now is the number of small donors that support the movement. Oftentimes, when we think of social justice movements, we think of big philanthropy and big donors. If anything, one of the things this moment has highlighted is the lack of proximity of big philanthropy and how out of touch big philanthropy actually is with Black-led, especially Black women-led, organizations. This has always been an issue with philanthropy and highlights the structural disparities in giving around social and racial justice issues. You should see big philanthropy all over these issues, but they are not, in part because philanthropy doesn't necessarily like to fund direct action. They have been very slow to fund anything that is anti-capitalist and anything that smells of abolition.\n\nIf big philanthropy were to start funding Black-led organizations at a greater capacity, what would the impact of that be?\n\nIf big philanthropy supported Black women-led organizations at the level where they support white male-led organizations, this movement and protest could've come sooner. Money isn't everything, and money doesn't make movements, but if big philanthropy actually came and supported the imagination of Black women organizers and activists, so much could be possible in this country.\n\nTo close out, what are the top three steps the movement needs to take to keep this going through November and in years to come?\n\nFirst, people need to continue to educate themselves about the depths of white supremacy and systemic racism in this country. It doesn't mean reading just two books and say, \"I'm anti-racist!\" No, you have to do more work. You have to challenge yourself on things you may not agree with. Public education also means that people, communities, and institutions actually examine the past ways that they have contributed to the unmattering of black lives. One of the things we like to do is just move forward and say, \"We're going to do better in the future.\" How, when you don't even know what you did? Your corporation, your wealth, is built on Black people. Saying you will do better in the future does not yet address the past.\n\nSecond, people need to understand the role and importance of protests. People are a bit confused about the importance of protests, so moving forward people need to understand the importance of protests for large-scale, long-term change in this country. Protest is key.\n\nAnd third, the movement must combine the protests in the streets with protests inside of formal political and legal institutions. That will propel the movement forward. It can't end in the streets; it has to end in the transformation of political and legal structures in this country.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nApparently, we can't even trust these justices to follow their own very recent precedents.\n\nThe Court decided an identical case two years ago. But every voting rights case that reaches this Court is dangerous.\n\nAn expert on Black voting explains what's really happening with Black support for Donald Trump.\n\nThe acclaimed writer takes on another intractable problem.\n\nThe US has often singled out Haitian immigrants. GOP attacks are the latest example.\n\nPreliminary data shows a negative impact on Black enrollment at some universities.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC. All Rights Reserved"

Protesters showed up - and so did armed militia.\n\nWhile there were no spectators in the stands ( fans were all virtual ), hundreds of armed members of NFAC - the Not Fucking Around Coalition - positioned themselves on the grass outside the complex hours before the event. The group of Black men and women assembled with weapons and announced themselves to the police as \"the response not the threat.\"\n\n\"We had hoped to come back to Louisville to celebrate a victory with these people. We had hoped that [the Taylor case] would have been closed,\" the group's leader, John \"Grandmaster Jay\" Johnson, said at Saturday's event. Some in the Black community had previously urged Churchill Downs to cancel the Kentucky Derby to show solidarity with the fight for racial justice.\n\nBut the group dispersed before the Derby even began when a white militia group appeared. Though Johnson told reporters he had an agreement with local police departments about NFAC's presence, he said the agreement was breached when that other armed collective - who said they were there to protect the city against NFAC - was allowed in the same space.\n\nMeanwhile, a few miles away in downtown Louisville, Black Lives Matter protesters clashed with members of the far-right armed militia group American Patriots USA earlier in the day. Protesters carried Black Lives Matter flags and chanted \"Breonna Taylor\" as the counterprotesters carried Trump Keep America Great flags and chanted \"USA\" and \"Back the Blue,\" referring to police.\n\nProtests against police violence and for racial justice have been happening around the country since May, when video of the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd went viral. While counterprotesters have been showing up in cities for just as long, in recent weeks, tensions have gotten more heated and violence at the hands of extremists has turned fatal.\n\nThat same Labor Day weekend, protesters and armed militia gathered in the streets of other cities in the wake of other deadly clashes. On Labor Day, more than 1,000 supporters of Trump, including Patriot Prayer supporters, QAnon conspiracy theory supporters, and members of the Proud Boys, gathered in northwest Oregon to express support for the president and Aaron Danielson, a Patriot Prayer supporter who was killed in a clash the previous weekend in Portland by Michael Rienoehl, who considered himself an antifa supporter .\n\nProtesters also clashed with police and counterprotesters in Rochester over the previous police killing of Daniel Prude , leading to the resignation of top law enforcement officials.\n\n\"We first went out thinking it would be a peaceful protest, but things turned on the first night,\" said Danielle Ponder, a public defender based in Rochester who has protested every night since the video of Prude's killing was released on September 2. \"We were met with pepper spray completely unprovoked. It was like war, unlike anything I've ever seen. We can't stop now, and I hope this empowers people to demand more.\"\n\nThe intensity and frequency of these clashes makes it apparent that there will be more to come as summer draws to a close, and with two months until Election Day. And protesters have made it clear that they will not stop until justice is delivered. Far-right counterprotesters, on the other hand, are feeling greater pressure to maintain the status quo of a Trump presidency. Add local and federal officials calling in more police or the National Guard as a solution, and tensions only rise. The chaos could result in more division and deaths, taking the focus off one of the largest civil rights movement in history and its mission to seek justice for Black lives.\n\nA new report from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project, in collaboration with Princeton University's Bridging Divides Initiative, identified 7,750 Black Lives Matter protests from May 26 through August 22 at 2,400 locations across the US. An examination of these events found that 93 percent of them remained peaceful while protests at about 220 locations turned \"violent\" - defined as the destruction of property, and including clashes between protesters and police and counterprotesters. The report also found that in these places the violence was restricted to specific blocks of the city and not widespread.\n\nYet, despite the fact that protests remained largely peaceful over the course of about four months, the report warned that a hyper-polarized environment spurred by state forces that take \"a more heavy-handed approach to dissent\" will only make non-state actors \"more active and assertive,\" and that counterdemonstrators will \"resolve their political disputes in the street\" ahead of the election.\n\n\"Without significant mitigation efforts, these risks will continue to intensify in the lead-up to the vote,\" the authors wrote.\n\nThe report also noted the National Guard had been deployed across the country at least 55 times since the killing of George Floyd in late May, which has only inflamed tensions. It also found that government forces disproportionately used force - fired tear gas, rubber bullets, and pepper spray, or beat protesters with batons - when intervening in Black Lives Matter protests, relative to other kinds of demonstrations.\n\nIn Portland, for example, federal agents were sent to ostensibly keep the peace in July, but instead used excessive force and detained people in unmarked vehicles , only reescalating tensions. After the deployment of Department of Homeland Security agents in Portland, \"the percentage of violent demonstrations has risen from under 17% to over 42%, suggesting that the federal response has only aggravated unrest,\" the report states.\n\nCounterprotest activity is also on the rise, a trend that can quickly escalate the number of violent clashes, according to the report:\n\nBetween 24 May and 22 August, over 360 counter-protests were recorded around the country, accounting for nearly 5% of all demonstrations. Of these, 43 - nearly 12% - turned violent, with clashes between pro-police demonstrators and demonstrators associated with the BLM movement, for example. In July alone, ACLED records over 160 counter-protests, or more than 8% of all demonstrations. Of these, 18 turned violent.\n\nIn the nights following the police shooting of Jacob Blake on August 23 in Kenosha, Wisconsin, armed counterprotesters visited the city to purportedly protect it from looting and vandalism. One such vigilante, 17-year-old Kyle Rittenhouse, fatally shot two people and injured another, and was later charged with first-degree intentional homicide. This unrest would give rise to more unrest in Portland where Trump supporters clashed with antifa members - both groups separate from peaceful Black Lives Matter protesters - resulting in the death of Danielson.\n\nClashes will only continue to increase if police and state and federal officials continue their heavy-handed approach to demonstrators. \"The current administration seems to thrive in the context of disorder, so you can imagine that there's going to be more, which is just going to spin off confrontations,\" University of Michigan political scientist Christian Davenport told Vox.\n\nThe recent clashes have historical precedent, rooted in the urban disturbances of the 1960s and '70s. Beginning in 1964, tensions between Black demonstrators and law enforcement caused riots across cities like Rochester, Philadelphia, and Newark. By 1967, hundreds of cities had experienced long, hot summers marked by urban rebellion and unrest.\n\nPonder, too, sees the resemblance to the civil rights movement. \"State troopers were out there with tanks and dogs!\" she said of the current Rochester protests. \"I'm out there wearing a T-shirt and jeans and we are being met by people flanked in complete military uniforms and officers in riot gear. It felt like a complete war zone. At one point we ran into a church. And I just kept thinking, 'We're hiding from our government in a church.' They even pepper sprayed the outside of the church!\"\n\nBecause of these historical connections, there are dueling performances, Davenport said. \"To what extent can protesters stay seemingly nonviolent but persistent?\"\n\nWhile the Black Lives Matter protesters are there to draw attention to systemic oppression, the presence of the far-right counterprotesters represents a desire to resist social change. \"These people aren't upset. They believe they are protecting that which they see as the natural order. They see these other people as the heretics and the threat,\" Davenport said.\n\nAnd the increased presence of other non-state actors, like antifa and the NFAC, serves to \"openly intimidate perceived 'enemies,'\" like the counterprotesters, according to the report. Though violence has not erupted every time these groups are present, tensions can escalate quickly.\n\nIn the end, counterprotest dynamics tend to squeeze out middle-of-the-road protesters. \"We then have a race, not to the middle, but to the extremes,\" Davenport said.\n\nMaking things more complicated and further compromising peaceful protesters is that right-wing counterprotesters and the government have overlapping interests. Some are there with guns, touting a need for law and order like the president does and chanting \"Back the Blue\" to signal their support for the work of law enforcement.\n\nIn one video from Labor Day weekend , a counterprotester told a Black Lives Matter supporter that they were there to support the police but not the \"bad eggs\" in the police force. \"We're not out here defending the actions of them fucking bad cops. At all. They need justice. But at the same time, we can't blame the actions of just a few on everybody.\" Flying next to the counterprotester was a large Trump 2020 flag.\n\n\"You have an ill-informed group that's already hostile and a group that has way too much information about their lives and they're frustrated about what's going on and you stick these people out in the street with a lackadaisical police effort, this does not bode well,\" Davenport said.\n\nThrough all this, Black Lives Matter protesters have never shied away from their demands: The desire to completely rethink how criminal justice and law enforcement systems function in America.\n\nPonder says their demands are clear in Rochester. Protesters are calling for the resignation of Mayor Lovely Warren and Deputy Mayor James Smith. They're asking that the officers involved in Prude's killing be prosecuted - Prude, who had a clinical history of mental illness, died after officers put a mesh \"spit hood\" over his head - and that the city enact \"Daniel's Law,\" which would prohibit officers from responding to mental health calls for help.\n\nThey're also asking for the immediate demilitarization of the police, since 86 percent of all adult arrests in Rochester are misdemeanors . Last, activists are calling for the defunding of the Rochester Police Department, which receives about $100 million per year. The school district's budget was recently cut by about 20 percent while the police department only received a 5 percent cut , Ponder said.\n\nAnd they will continue to be out in the streets, much like 93 percent of peaceful demonstrations across the country, until their demands are met. The election has little bearing on this.\n\nWhile the election is often thought of as a nice end point used to facilitate mobilization, the difficulty with thinking about Black Lives Matter only in the context of the election is losing \"the deeper narrative that folks are generationally upset,\" Davenport said. \"It's not every four years. It's several decades worth of stuff that led us to this point that Democrats and Republicans are responsible for.\"\n\nWhether Black Lives Matter activists will choose to shift strategy in an effort to position themselves away from right-wing agents provocateurs, particularly ahead of the election, is still left to be seen, but questions about the connections between clashes and the election may take away from the deeper goals of the movement.\n\n\"What would this turn into if Black Lives Matter and associates could say, 'Let's shift the nature of our confrontation with violence-generating agents in a way that allows us to put forward pressure but doesn't allow our behavior or presence to be manipulated in a manner that could potentially lead to something that facilitates this other narrative. Let's not participate in what has become the anti-performance of our grievance. We're not going to be fodder for this war machine,'\" Davenport said.\n\nPonder, meanwhile, is thinking about change that needs to start locally in Rochester - \"There are thousands of people who could have been Daniel Prude because our officers continue to dehumanize the Black community\" - but also hopes the movement will continue to uplift and inspire young people, despite the repeated clashes with law enforcement and counterprotesters.\n\n\"I have never seen such a Black movement. I have never seen so many young Black people in the street protesting,\" she said. \"I hope this empowers them to demand more from their elected officials. And I hope they become the elected officials to really shift the paradigm and transform our system of policing and criminal justice.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nAn exhausting - if not exhaustive - timeline of J.K.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nHow identity politics changed the Democratic Party - for the better.\n\nby Ezra Klein\n\nPolarization, party sorting, and identity politics are central villains of our time. Politicians lament them. Pundits loathe them. Book after book has been written blaming them for society's ills, from the decline of reason to the electoral travails of the Democratic Party to the death of American democracy .\n\nBut the past month of sustained, mass activism against police brutality offers evidence for the defense - that sorting around identity can be inclusive, that polarization can be productive.\n\nThe historically multiethnic nature of the Black Lives Matter protests, and the rapid change in polling around racial issues, is partly the result of decades of polarization that have put African Americans in coalition with Hispanics, Asians, and white liberals. The Democratic Party is increasingly a coalition of people who experience racism directly or base part of their identity on opposing it ideologically. This is something new in American politics, and it carries within it real reason for hope.\n\n\"If we were ever to have a national reckoning with our legacy of racial violence, it would require immense political power on the side of the people who wanted the reckoning,\" says University of Maryland political scientist Lilliana Mason, who studies polarization. \"We've never had a political party that was almost entirely in agreement that systemic racism exists, particularly among the white partisans. But that's changing very quickly.\"\n\nRacism is America's founding sin, and it cuts the deepest divisions in our political history. But those divisions, across the 20th century, existed in both political coalitions simultaneously. In 1994, 39 percent of Democrats, and 26 percent of Republicans, said discrimination was the main reason Black Americans had trouble getting ahead. There was a gap, but it was modest. As Michael Tesler, a political scientist who studies racial polarization at the University of California Irvine, has shown , up through the 2000s, the parties were more similar than different when polled on racial issues.\n\nBarack Obama's election, the Black Lives Matter movement, and Donald Trump's rise changed that. Race became a central division between the parties, driven by demographic changes that gave a multiethnic Democratic coalition the numbers to win power, and drove racially conservative white Democrats into the Republican Party. By 2017, 64 percent of Democrats said discrimination was why Black Americans had trouble getting ahead, but only 14 percent of Republicans said the same. A 13-point difference had become a 50-point chasm.\n\nThe same massive levels of polarization were on display in the polling following George Floyd's death. A Monmouth survey found that 71 percent of Democrats, but only 37 percent of Republicans, thought the anger driving the protests was justified. A CNN poll found 92 percent of Democrats, but only 37 percent of Republicans, believe the criminal justice system is biased against Black Americans. A CBS poll found that 76 percent of Democrats, but only 24 percent of Republicans, believed African Americans face \"a lot\" of discrimination in daily life.\n\nPolarization can create the conditions for overdue reckonings, for broader coalitions. When the parties were mixed, and racially conservative whites were seen as the key swing vote, racial issues were suppressed in American politics. The passage of the Civil Rights Act is the exception that proves the rule: Civil rights laws had been blocked in Congress for decades, and the rupture required to unblock them broke the party system of that era. The polarization of the parties around race and ideology - a story I tell in detail in my book Why We're Polarized - created an incentive for one party, at least, to prioritize issues of racial justice.\n\n\"As the parties became more polarized around racial issues, it became much safer for Democratic politicians to embrace racial issues,\" says Christopher Stout, a political scientist at Oregon State University and the author of Bringing Race Back In: Black Politicians, Deracialization, and Voting Behavior in the Age of Obama . \"Even in 2008, there was a lot of hesitancy to talk about race. Think back to Obama and Jeremiah Wright. But as white working-class voters who were racially conservative left the Democratic Party, it created space for Democrats to talk about race and be rewarded for it rather than punished for it.\"\n\nJoe Biden's career reflects the arc of this change. As he has gotten in trouble for saying, when he entered Congress, in the 1970s, he worked often with conservative, segregationist Democrats. These weren't just coalitions of expedience: He took positions on issues like crime and busing meant to mollify racially conservative white voters. But Biden changed alongside his party. By 2008, those Democrats were gone, and Biden was Obama's vice president, in an administration that cemented the Democratic Party's identity as the party of a multiethnic America.\n\nThen Donald Trump emerged as a backlash candidate to Obama, further clarifying the divide for both sides. \"So much of what defines being a Democrat right now is hatred of Trump,\" says Tesler. \"And so much of what Trump stands for is racially resentful positions and ethnocentrism. So it became really dissonant to be a Democrat who's not on board with a racially progressive agenda.\"\n\nToday, Biden is the Democratic Party's expected nominee for president, his success powered by black voters, his opponent Trump, his most important supporter America's first black president. In his first remarks after George Floyd's death and the ensuing protests and uprisings, Biden warned white Americans that \"the pain is too intense for one community to bear alone,\" and said that \"with our complacency, our silence, we are complicit in perpetuating these cycles of violence.\"\n\nIn a sharp analysis, the New York Times noted that Biden's statement was notable for what was missing. \"He made no attempt to soothe the fears of those white Americans who, while sympathetic to the plight of people of color, are just as uneasy about the kind of disturbances that left parts of Minneapolis in flames Thursday night.\"\n\nA few weeks later, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) dropped out of Biden's vice presidential search and called on Biden to choose a woman of color for the ticket. \"After what I've seen in my state and what I've seen across the country, this is a historic moment and America must seize on this moment,\" she said. \"I truly believe, as I told the vice president last night, that I believe that this is a moment to put a woman of color on that ticket.\"\n\nIdentity politics is often tossed around as a slur, an epithet. A politics of identity is said to be exclusionary, pitting Americans against each other, denying them the common ground of shared experience. This is oft-made criticism of \"Black Lives Matter\" as a slogan, by those who prefer \"all lives matter.\" But we are seeing the rebuttal to that argument in the political reality of this moment, where 91 percent of Democrats - and 92 percent of white Democrats - express support for Black Lives Matter (as do 40 percent of Republicans). A politics of identity can be inclusionary, building bridges across experiences that would otherwise remain siloed.\n\nThe modern Democratic Party, for reasons of both demography and ideology, takes seriously the idea that to be Black in America is a different experience than being white in America. And that has formed a coalition that now takes Black Lives Matter as a multiethnic rallying cry. As Matt Yglesias shows in his essay on \" The Great Awokening ,\" white liberals now express more liberal views on some racial issues than Black Democrats. In this case, the Democratic Party's openness to \"identity politics\" has led white liberals to a politics that reaches far beyond their own experiences.\n\n\"If Democrats want to talk about public health or the environment through a racial lens, they don't need to worry their white base will be turned off,\" says Wellesley political scientist Jennifer Chudy, who studies the political dynamics of cross-racial sympathy.\n\nIdentity is never singular. We have many identities, some of them linked together, some of them sitting in tension. The story of modern political polarization is identities fusing together: Black, Jewish, liberal, atheist, urbanite - Democrat . White, evangelical, rural, conservative, hunter - Republican . Identity fusion creates stronger bonds of solidarity between those who share identities, and can create more conflict with those who become the out-group. It is both inclusionary and exclusionary. But for groups who've long been marginalized, who haven't had the power to force their concerns and their experiences to the forefront of national politics, it can be transformative.\n\nThere is no action without reaction, of course. The promise of change that thrills some Americans unnerves others. Trump is president because Obama was president. We will not suddenly find agreement on America's oldest divides, easy redemption for our oldest sins. And our political system is designed to reflect consensus, not resolve conflict. This is why, in part, polarization is so feared: It breeds government paralysis, wanton obstruction, dangerous brinksmanship.\n\nEven so, we should prefer the difficulties of political conflict to the injustice of suppression. Police brutality is as old as America, but it has been rare for either of our major political parties to take it seriously, much less make it - and racial inequality more broadly - central to their agendas. Change at the level America needs may not be likely, but it would be impossible if neither party was willing to fight for it. That one is beginning to do so now is the product of relentless organizing, activism, and courage among Black Americans, but it is also the product of polarization, sorting, and identity politics.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

      "text": "The global impact of George Floyd: How Black Lives Matter protests shaped movements around the world\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nJune 4, 2021 / 7:39 PM EDT / CBS News\n\nGeorge Floyd's murder in Minneapolis in May 2020 sparked the largest racial justice protests in the United States since the Civil Rights Movement. But the movement went far beyond this nation's borders - it inspired a global reckoning with racism.\n\nThis time last year, countries across the globe had some of the largest Black Lives Matter protests in their history, all inspired by the video of Floyd brutal death in police custody on May 25, 2020. Crossing continents and cultures, Black activists saw Floyd's death as a symbol of the intolerance and injustice they face at home.\n\nSome of these countries had their own George Floyd - a Black person whose death by police brutality or racial violence created national outrage. Everywhere, activists knew there was no going back to the way things were before they witnessed Floyd's final moments.\n\nPresident Biden said that when he met with Floyd's young daughter Gianna, she told him, \"Daddy changed the world.\" These worldwide protests show how right she was.\n\nThe United Kingdom had the largest Black Lives Matter protests in the world last summer outside of the United States. Even before George Floyd, protesters were already galvanized by a death in their own country.\n\nBelly Mujinga, a Black transport worker in London, died from COVID-19 in April 2020 after saying that a White man spit on her in a racist attack at work. Coworkers said Mujinga had complained before the incident about not having proper protection while working during the pandemic.\n\nPolice closed the case, citing a lack of evidence, which mobilized a first wave of protests. Floyd's death fueled this into a larger movement confronting the country's historical and systemic racism.\n\n\"England is not an overtly racist country, in my humble opinion,\" Imarn Ayton, an organizer of the London protests, told CBS News at the time. \"It is a covertly racist country. So we are much more subtle and polite with our racism.\"\n\nBut the time to be polite was over.\n\nProtesters and police clashed at some of the demonstrations. Some protesters tore down and vandalized statues of slave traders and political leaders - even some who were considered national heroes. A statue of Winston Churchill in London's Parliament Square was spray-painted with a message calling him a \"racist.\"\n\nWithin days, London's protests exploded from about 20 people outside the U.S. embassy to more than 20,000 people flooding the streets. Celebrities joined, including Madonna and John Boyega, who gave an impassioned address to protesters.\n\nMonths after the protests, the government commissioned a report examining institutional racism in the U.K. But its release in March 2021 stunned activists because it simply rejected their claims of systemic problems.\n\n\"Put simply we no longer see a Britain where the system is deliberately rigged against ethnic minorities,\" the report from the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities said.\n\n\"Too often 'racism' is the catch-all explanation, and can be simply implicitly accepted rather than explicitly examined.\"\n\nThat same month, Parliament introduced a bill that would give police greater power to restrict protests. Ironically, it inspired a new round of protests with the rallying cry \"Kill The Bill,\" that also called attention to the problem of violence against women .\n\n\"We have taken one step forward and about five steps back since the BLM movement in the U.K.,\" Ayton said.\n\n\"Seeing Black and White people galvanized, standing against racism, scared the living daylights out of the government, out of the Metropolitan Police, out of a lot of people. I think it's purely due to the fact that there was a huge shift in power in that moment.\"\n\nTHE GLOBAL IMPACT OF GEORGE FLOYD: This time last year, the United Kingdom saw the largest #BlackLivesMatter protests in the world outside of the U.S. Activists say England has more covert racism than the United States - but they are still fighting many of the same issues. pic.twitter.com/w7HLvl4Caf\n\nNew Zealand has a global reputation for peace and tolerance. But Black Lives Matter protesters there say that comes from a reluctance to speak directly about race and discrimination. George Floyd finally started those conversations.\n\n\"New Zealand's probably one of the most difficult places to be Black in this world,\" Guled Mire, an organizer for the protesters in the capital city, Wellington, told CBS News. \"Imagine you are Black, but you're not allowed to be Black. That's literally how it is over there.\"\n\nProtests coincided with New Zealand conducting a trial run of arming its police officers - something not routinely done there. The experiment was a response to the 2019 mass shootings at two mosques in Christchurch , which were committed by a white supremacist . But Black and Indigenous populations worried that armed police would only put them in danger.\n\n\"We addressed the prime minister directly and the government and we said, 'We're not gonna stand for this, and we oppose this,'\" said Mazou Q, a rapper who helped organize protests in Auckland. \"Because we don't want to end up like the United States.\"\n\nThe government announced days after the first protests that it would scrap plans to arm police, though it did not credit the protests for influencing that decision.\n\nPeople of African descent compromise less than 1% of New Zealand's population. But the protests brought Black protesters together with Indigenous Māori and Pacific Islanders, creating a movement for racial progress unlike anything the country had seen for years. One protest in Wellington drew more than 20,000 people.\n\n\"The kind of escapism that we indulged in in the past wouldn't suffice anymore,\" Mazbou Q said. \"We had to reckon with what was happening, and we had to take a side...There was no more status quo as an option.\"\n\nNew Zealand has a global reputation for peace and tolerance. But George Floyd's death last summer moved Black activists to speak up about problems they say the country is \"in complete denial\" about. pic.twitter.com/cqsQHDEwXB\n\nIn France, protesters rallied against their nation's own history of racial injustice and police brutality, which has very different roots from the U.S.\n\nIn 1960, 17 sub-Saharan African nations, including 14 former French colonies, gained independence from their former European colonists. Today, many of the Black people living in France emigrated from those colonies.\n\nWith an eye on the United States, children of immigrants from Africa and the Caribbean are bringing race into the French public discourse.\n\n\"There is this refusal to take into account the history of slavery and colonization, and how race was part of it and how we're still dealing with the legacy,\" said Nathalie Etoke, an associate professor of Francophone and Africana Studies at the City University of New York Graduate Center.\n\nThe thousands of protesters in Paris were joined by the family of Adama Traore, who died on his 24th birthday in 2016 under circumstances similar to Floyd. Three police officers put their weight on him to restrain him, and he could not be revived after being brought to a police station. There were no charges for his death.\n\n\"We're demanding acts of justice, not discussions,\" Adama's sister Assa Traore said in a press conference last June, as protests continued into their second week. \"We'll protest in the streets every week if necessary.\"\n\nGeorge Floyd was killed in Minneapolis. But thousands of miles away in France, his death sparked unprecedented protests against anti-Black violence - the roots of which are far different than the United States, but the experience of which is all too familiar. pic.twitter.com/qn6cnSwvQr\n\nIn Colombia, the news of Floyd's death was bookended by two notorious police killings domestically.\n\nOn May 22, 2020 - just three days before Floyd's killing - a young Black man named Anderson Arboleda was beaten to death by police for allegedly violating coronavirus curfew restrictions. Protesters soon marched to the U.S. embassy in Bogota, moved by the deaths of both Arboleda and Floyd.\n\nThen on September 9, 46-year-old Javier Ordóñez died after being brutalized in police custody - which was caught on video. In the footage, Ordóñez is heard saying \"I am choking\" and \"Enough, no more, please\" as officers kneel on him and use stun guns on him.\n\nThe deaths set off months of protests, some of which ended in violent and even deadly police crackdowns. During recent protests in Colombia over inequality and police brutality, local activist groups say at least 43 people have been killed by police. More than 2,900 cases of police brutality have also been reported.\n\nActivists say the cases of Floyd and Ordóñez inspired people to record incidents with police. And protesters say that even the threat of death isn't stopping them from continuing to challenge police violence and systemic brutality.\n\n\"A lot of people tell me, 'Yolanda, don't risk your life by marching in the streets knowing it can put you at risk,'\" said Yolanda Perea, a human rights defender in Chocó. \"But I'll continue to march and defend our lives.

The city created Black Lives Matter Plaza , near the White House, less than two weeks after Floyd's death, and it is now a regular gathering space for protest and activism.\n\nWashington was also the site of the nation's most notorious crackdown on protesters. On June 1, law enforcement used tear gas and riot control tactics to push peaceful protesters from Lafayette Square so that then-President Trump could cross the cleared-out street and pose in front of the vandalized St. John's Church, holding a Bible.\n\nThe photo-op and use of force drew condemnation from military officials and even some of Mr. Trump's supporters, who believed it crossed a line.\n\nOn August 28, thousands gathered for the 2020 March on Washington at the Lincoln Memorial, with George Floyd's brother Philonise addressing the crowd.\n\nMeanwhile, the local Black Lives Matter chapter started mutual aid initiatives in all eight wards of the city to work to bring about some of the changes that they've yet to see from institutions.\n\n\"We have built a stronger community and reimagined a world where we keep us safe and we can build a world without police,\" Neenee Taylor, the former mass engagement and rapid response coordinator for Black Lives Matter D.C., told CBS News. \"And so that's what has changed for our community since George Floyd in D.C. But as far as the government - hasn't nothing changed.\"\n\nLast summer, in the aftermath of George Floyd's death, Washington D.C. became a focal point for the country's #BlackLivesMatter protests - inspiring a new, younger generation of activists in the process. pic.twitter.com/ZORecd3DcY\n\nJason Silverstein is the supervising politics producer for the CBS News social media team, working with teams in New York and Washington, D.C. to oversee coverage of national politics and the 2024 campaign.\n\n© 2021 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "text": "Why saying \"all lives matter\" communicates to Black people that their lives don't\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nJuly 8, 2020 / 9:37 AM EDT / CBS News\n\nThe deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Rayshard Brooks have not only served to reignite the Black Lives Matter movement, but also the furor at its most common rebuttal: \"all lives matter.\"\n\nThe back and forth has been going on for seven years, and just last week, when pressed repeatedly on his refusal to say \"Black lives matter,\" Vice President Mike Pence echoed those words on \" Face The Nation \": \"I really believe all lives matter.\"\n\nWhile some purposely say \"all lives matter\" to provoke conflict, others see it as a harmless, even inclusive remark. But that isn't the way most Black people experience it.\n\n\"My life matters,\" said Jason Reynolds, author of \"All American Boys.\" \"And if you say, 'No, all lives matter,' what I would say is I believe that you believe all lives matter. But because I live the life that I live, I am certain that in this country, all lives [don't] matter. I know for a fact that, based on the numbers, my life hasn't mattered; that black women's lives definitely haven't mattered, that black trans people's lives haven't mattered, that black gay people's lives haven't mattered... that immigrants' lives don't matter, that Muslims' lives don't matter. The Indigenous people of this country's lives have never mattered. I mean, we could go on and on and on. So, when we say 'all lives,' are we talking about White lives? And if so, then let's just say that. 'Cause it's coded language.\"\n\nSome members of the Black community emphasized to CBS News that the phrase \"Black Lives Matter\" does not mean \"Black lives matter more.\" It means, \"Black lives matter, as well.\" And some of the hurtful confusion could very well stem from a fundamental misunderstanding of that.\n\nFor lifestyle blogger Ayana Lage, whether the phrase is posted with ill intentions or good ones, the effect is the same. It derails the conversation.\n\n\"It's the same as when people bring up 'black-on-black crime' when you are discussing police brutality, or say 'well, why don't you care about Chicago?' Literally anytime that I mention anything about Black Lives Matter or police reform, I get comments about 'well, what about the looters.' And I'm kind of like, well that's not what we're talking about,\" she told CBS News. \"The talking points are almost all the same when you're having conversations with people: black-on-black crime, Chicago, I don't see color, you want to be a victim, all lives matter. I mean, you just hear the same things from people and you just start to think, 'Man, maybe some people are committed to misunderstanding what we're trying to do here.'\"\n\n\"No one's saying that your life doesn't matter,\" Lage continued. \"What we're saying... is all lives can't matter until black lives matter.\"\n\n\"When [all lives matter] first became a hashtag, it felt like such a knee-jerk response to something that was not understood. It almost heightened the Black Lives Matter movement in a way because it was like, so you really don't get it,\" said fitness influencer Bryce Michael Wood, who hosts the Zoom series, \"For Your Discomfort.\" \"Like, how is that your response to me saying 'Black Lives Matter?' Because before Black Lives Matter, before that movement, no one was saying 'all lives matter.' No one felt the need to position themselves that way.\"\n\nSonya Renee Taylor, author and founder of \"The Body Is Not an Apology,\" likens it to your wife asking you if she's pretty and you responding \"all people are pretty.\"\n\n\"It's probably not going to go over very well in your family, right?\" said Taylor. \"Your wife is probably going to have a problem with that. Because what she wants in that moment is specificity. You know, what's desired in that moment is to be seen in her unique experience with you. And that's what Black people are asking for right now: to be seen in our unique experience in the world. To actually be seen and valued.\"\n\nChristina Capatides is the vice president of Social Media and Trending Content for CBS News and Stations.

      "text": "Alicia Garza on the origin of Black Lives Matter\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nOctober 18, 2020 / 9:26 AM EDT / CBS News\n\nThis summer the Black Lives Matter movement took center stage, from global protests to a renamed plaza in Washington, D.C., to murals adorning neighborhoods throughout the country. And last month, the movement's founders - Patrisse Cullors, Opal Tometi and Alicia Garza - found themselves on the cover of Time magazine.\n\n\"My hope in helping to put this forward wasn't to start a movement,\" said Garza, the Oakland-based activist who'd coined the phrase \"Black Lives Matter.\" \"My hope was to actually change people's minds, to change the way that we see ourselves, so that we can stand up in a stronger footing to be able to change the things that we don't like that are happening around us.\"\n\nGarza's soon-to-be released book, \"The Purpose of Power,\" is her own story of Black organizing and Black resistance. She talked with \"Sunday Morning\" contributor Mark Whitaker about her book, from Marcus Books, the country's oldest Black bookstore. \"I wanted to make sure that we were in a place that really represents the legacy and the enduring tradition of Black organizing and Black resistance,\" she said.\n\nWhile many might remember first hearing the phrase \"Black Lives Matter\" during the 2014 protests in Ferguson, Missouri , the movement actually began a year earlier, the day George Zimmerman was found not guilty of murdering 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Florida. After the verdict's announcement, a stunned Garza penned several Facebook posts.\n\nWhitaker asked, \"Was that a phrase, just something that came pouring out?\"\n\n\"Well, let me just say I'm not a big Twitter user. So, when I first used the words 'Black Lives Matter,' it was on Facebook.\"\n\nCullors, a Los Angeles-based activist who was Twitter savvy, added a hashtag.\n\n\"I thought it was a pound sign!\" Garza said. \"She broke down what hashtags are to me. And that's how #BlackLivesMatter was born.\"\n\nNow called \"the hashtag heard around the world,\" Black Lives Matter is a worldwide phenomenon.\n\nGarza traces her own path to activism to her mother and her upbringing during the 1980s and '90s in an affluent suburb of San Francisco, where, she says, being an outsider gave her a unique vantage point. \"I grew up with the ethos that you always fight for the underdog. You know, Black folks forever had been working hard to get ahead, but that this country wasn't working hard for Black people and didn't plan to.\"\n\nGarza also credits MTV News for broadening her perspective. with stories about the apartheid system in South Africa, famine in Ethiopia, and domestic politics.\n\n\"This was a time when there was a big debate happening nationally about the epidemic of teen pregnancy,\" said Garza. \"And there was a big fight over whether or not young people should have the tools that they needed to make decisions as they were making choices about whether or not to have sex.\"\n\n\"So, that was your first big cause as an activist?\" asked Whitaker.\n\n\"I was 12 years old, I was in middle school,\" she replied.\n\nIn her book, Garza recounts a formative moment at age 17: a run-in with a police officer who found her smoking marijuana with a friend, and let her off with only a warning. \"I was a kid who was doing things that kids do,\" she said. \"And I was given a shot. But most Black kids who were my age at that time are not given a shot. And guaranteed, if I had been a 17-year-old Black girl in West Oakland caught with the same amount of marijuana, I would've spent, not just the night, but I would've had a criminal record.\"\n\nThe takeaway from this encounter resonates with Garza today: \"I think the moral of that story is this: we have a criminal system that is intent on treating some people differently than others. It's actually baked into the architecture of that system.\n\n\"And what this movement is fighting for, it is to, frankly, dismantle a system that was designed to criminalize Black people, that was designed to criminalize poor people and people of color and other oppressed people.\"\n\nWhitaker asked, \"So, when you use the term 'dismantle,' I think some people are confused right now about exactly what that means. Does it mean dismantling a certain kind of policing in certain communities? What do you want dismantled?\"\n\n\"Well, I didn't talk about dismantling police; I talked about dismantling systems,\" Garza replied. \"And so, when we talk about dismantling systems that are harmful to our communities, it means taking them apart and stopping our usage of them. But we can't just dismantle without building something in its place. And I think what's important for all of us to engage in is a reimagining of what it looks like to have dignified communities where we are not patrolling communities with guns and tanks.\"\n\nGarza is now focusing her efforts beyond Black Lives Matter, founding groups aimed at empowering women and building Black political power.\n\nWhitaker asked, \"What do you tell people when, as I'm sure they do on a daily basis, White folks say, 'What can we do to help?' What do you tell them?\"\n\n\"Well, I say, 'You can join a movement,'\" she laughed. \"Being in solidarity with Black Lives Matter, being a part of this larger movement for change in this country and around the world can't be about charity. I don't wanna fight next to anybody who's, like, 'You know, I'm doing this because you people need this.'\"\n\nAnd for those who think Black Lives Matter is merely a social media movement, Alicia Garza offers this: \"The story of movements is not about how many people follow you on social media. It's about how many people will step forward. And you can have a million followers on Twitter and not get one person to step forward and take action!\"\n\n\"So, is the leader or the founder of one of the most famous social media movements of the modern era telling us that social media isn't everything?\" asked Whitaker.\n\n\"Well, I can tell you, as the founder of the Black Lives Matter Global Network, which is now considered to be the largest protest movement in history, that hashtags do not start movements. People do.\"\n\nFor more info:\n\nStory produced by Kay Lim. Editor: Mike Levine.\n\n© 2020 CBS Interactive Inc. All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright ©2025 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved."

      "text": "Black Lives Matter Movement Shifts From Protest To Policy With Efforts To Hold Officers Accountable For Wrongdoing\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nMay 25, 2021 / 6:39 PM EDT / CBS New York\n\nNEW YORK (CBSNewYork) -- New York Attorney General Letitia James recently unveiled a proposal to overhaul police policies across the state.\n\nMany on the front lines say legislative action is the future of the fight for police accountability.\n\nAs CBS2's Cory James reports, last week James announced the Police Accountability Act , the latest move of law enforcement reform in New York.\n\n\"It would give prosecutors a critical additional tool to hold officers accountable for wrongdoing,\" she said.\n\nThe act changes the state's law for the use of force by establishing a \"last resort\" standard, banning lethal force based on belief a suspect committed a crime, and establishing criminal penalties for police who unlawfully cause physical injury or death.\n\nTHE DEATH OF GEORGE FLOYD: A RACIAL RECKONING?\n\nThe changes are exactly what Isaac Ortega and thousands of others fought to see following the murder of George Floyd .\n\n\"It's not normal for me to be pepper sprayed or tear-gassed,\" Ortega told James.\n\nOrtega, a New York City activist, helped organize over 40 Black Lives Matter demonstrations in the Empire State, a number of them at Washington Square Park .\n\n\"It feels surreal. This is where a lot of the action was,\" Ortega said during a visit to the park. \"The energy of the park has shifted.\"\n\nHe says in recent months, the movement has largely shifted from protest to policy.\n\nRev. Al Sharpton echoing that and adding putting pressure on the Biden-Harris administration, Senate and Congress to pass laws are crucial in the continued fight.\n\n\"Because this case was almost aligned with the stars. You had a special prosecutor that did a great job, you had policemen that testified, you had a video tape,\" he said. \"So the stars lined up. You're not going to have that in every case. So you're going to have to have firmer, clearer laws. The battle now is not only demonstration, but legislation.\"\n\nThat legislation is the George Floyd Policing Act, which is stuck in the Senate. The initiative is designed to stop racial profiling by law enforcement at federal, state and local levels, banning chokeholds and no-knock warrants, and also requiring deadly force be only used as a last resort after officers have employed de-escalation techniques first.\n\nStates that do not comply would lose federal policing funding.\n\n\"There needs to be an investigation of the training,\" said Dr. Delores Jones-Brown, a former prosecutor and current criminology professor.\n\nShe believes in addition to passing the reform bill, the next frontier in the fight should also include looking at law enforcement training academies and holding its owners accountable for teaching unnecessary excessive force techniques.\n\n\"We often see the cases of police officers who are not convicted, there's testimony that they were doing what they were trained to do,\" she said. \"We wouldn't treat animals the way that George Floyd was treated and the fact that the defense counsel attempted, and it's a common pattern, but attempted to justify Chauvin's behavior because it was something he was trained to do means the Department of Justice, and we as a public, need to inquire.\"\n\nWhile a number of the BLM murals painted on New York City streets are fading, social media pages capture the momentum in an effort to keep it going.\n\n\"While the numbers have lessened, we're not seeing necessarily 20,000 people for every march, it's really the die hards, people who have been doing it since May of last year, that are still going out everyday,\" said Kevin Xavier, founder of NYCProtestCoverage.\n\nHe and other activists are proud of the transformative movement that has ignited some change, but they feel more work needs to be done.\n\n© 2021 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

      "text": "How a death in Ferguson sparked a movement in America\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nAugust 7, 2015 / 5:39 AM EDT / CBS News\n\nOne year ago, the nation watched as the city of Ferguson, Mo., erupted.\n\nSt. Louis police, dressed in riot gear, stood in a straight line, shields up and face masks down in a standoff with protestors. The media assembled on the sidelines, cameras poised to capture the latest. There was tear gas, burning buildings, chants and signs.\n\nProtesters came armed with a message, a message that would echo through the Missouri night sky in the days and weeks after Michael Brown's death. It was a message heard across the nation in more protests for other black Americans who died by  police hands. \"Black lives matter,\" they chanted, wrote and tweeted. \"Black lives matter,\" they chanted in throngs that blocked streets and demanded America's attention.\n\nWhile demonstrators took to the streets of Ferguson and cities like New York and Los Angeles , a new generation of activists gathered both on the ground and online. The Black Lives Matter movement called for change with how police deal with minorities, and demanded a look at systemic racism and equity. And from it emerged a group of young people paving the way.\n\nBrittany Packnett is one of them.\n\nPacknett, 30, grew up in north St. Louis County in an African-American household lead by parents with advanced degrees. She is an activist, educator and a Member of the President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing.\n\nShe said the death of Michael Brown deepened her commitment to social justice.\n\n\"I think the most significant thing that has changed is that people can see this isn't just about Mike Brown, this isn't just about Tamir Rice, and it isn't just about Sandra Bland,\" she said. \"It is about defending the humanity and the dignity of all people in this country and of people of color in particular.\"\n\nThe young movers and shakers who have been leading the Black Lives Matter movement are now one year out and reflecting back on how far the movement has come. And what else they think still needs to be done.\n\n\"I think what we have seen primarily change is that people recognize that here we are 365 days later and we are still talking about it,\" said Packnett.\n\nSince Brown's Death\n\nOn Dec. 1, 2014, Packnett stood outside the Oval Office with seven other young activists. While she waited to meet with President Barack Obama she reflected on the fact that it was her enslaved ancestors who had built the White House.\n\n\"We were responsible in that moment to speak truths about our community to the leader of the free world, and that was a real opportunity, but it was also a real responsibility,\" Packnett recalled.\n\nThe president announced the formation of the task force that day, and in the weeks to follow Packnett would be named as a member. In May 2015, the President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing released a comprehensive report identifying best policing practices and offering recommendations to strengthen trust among law enforcement officers and the communities they serve.\n\nA recent survey conducted by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research revealed that one year after the death of Michael Brown, more than 3 out of 5 blacks say they or a family member have personal experience with being treated unfairly by the police -- and their race is the reason. The poll also revealed that nearly 3 out of 4 white people thought race had nothing to do with how police in their communities decide to use deadly force.\n\nActivist and 25-year-old data scientist Samuel Sinyangwe, who lives in San Francisco, says the movement is making a difference anyway. He is a Stanford graduate who grew up in Orlando 15 minutes from where Trayvon Martin was killed. He helped found the website Mapping Police Violence after the death of Michael Brown.\n\n\"I had a lot of questions and I was frustrated by the fact that I couldn't get answers because the federal government was not collecting comprehensive information and data on police killings,\" he said. \"What I wanted to know was how prevalent and how widespread are police killings. How are they potentially targeting black people and young black people in particular.\"\n\nSinyangwe collected data by using two large crowdsourcing databases on police killings. He says Mapping Police Violence has come to many conclusions, including \"Ferguson is everywhere.\"\n\nSinyangwe's data has found that since 2015, at least 184 black people have been killed by police in the U.S. so far. In 2014, over 300 black people were killed. In the last year, Black Lives Matter has protested the deaths of  black people including Freddie Gray, Walter Scott, Sandra Bland and Tamir Rice, to name a few.\n\n\"Not only is it happening everywhere, it's happening in some places more than others. We are able to shine a spotlight on why some of these uprisings are happening in some places,\" Sinyangwe said. \"This is rooted in policy and the system can be changed.\"\n\nSinyangwe uses Newark, N.J. as an example. With about the same population and crime rate as St. Louis, and around the same amount of black people, crime in Newark is going down, Sinyangwe says. On the other hand, crime in St. Louis is going up. He says no black people have been killed by police in Newark since 2013, while 12 have been killed in St. Louis.\n\nHe says he hopes that the data Mapping Police Violence provides helps the problem of police violence be better understood, and helps towards addressing it.\n\nMany of the protests held over the last year occurred after officers were not charged with crimes, as was the case in the deaths of Michael Brown, Eric Garner and Tamir Rice. But just last week, a prosecutor was quick to charge a Univ. of Cincinnati police officer with the death of Samuel DuBose during a traffic stop in Ohio .\n\nAn Associated Press analysis released in late July revealed that 24 states have passed at least 40 new measures after Ferguson. The AP reports that the measures have included addressing such things as officer-worn cameras, training about racial bias, independent investigations when police use force and new limits on the flow of surplus military equipment to local law enforcement agencies.\n\nWhile the effects of these policies are new and not yet known, Sinyangwe says it is still progress.\n\n\"You really haven't seen anything as impactful as we are seeing this one right now in terms of seeing immediate legislation being proposed and passed and signed at all levels of government,\" he said.\n\nCriticism\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement hasn't come without its share of criticism. Some have called it anti-police, others anti-white; the majority of criticism has come from those on social media. The #BlackLivesMatter hashtag sparked another controversial hashtag as well, #AllLivesMatter.\n\n\"I thought it represented a real misunderstanding, that, unfortunately, happens often when marginalized people finally begin to tell our own story,\" said Packnett about #AllLivesMatter.\n\nSaying black lives matter is not the same as saying only black lives matter, Packnett said.\n\n\"What it is saying though is an acknowledgement of the fact that black lives, brown lives, that people of color in particular, are the ones suffering disproportionately from issues of police brutality, police violence and discrimination in the criminal justice system,\" she said.\n\nA CBS News/New York Times poll released in July revealed that nearly 6 in 10 Americans say they think race relations in America are bad. And among those polled, blacks are more likely than whites to hold this view. Nearly 8 in 10 African-Americans believe the criminal justice system is biased against them, up from 61 percent in 2013.\n\nBlack Lives Matter was sparked by a woman who tweeted it after the acquittal of George Zimmerman in the death of Trayvon Martin and it caught on, especially after the death of Michael Brown. It was also turned into an organization under the same name, Black Lives Matter . But the movement as a whole is also referred to as the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nAs Packnett explained, the movement has faced criticism for not having a single leader, no one person the head of the movement.\n\nA common misconception is that the movement is leaderless. But Packnett says it's actually \"leader-full,\" and not being under the rule of one or two people allows many people to pursue change in the way they believe most beneficial and in a decentralized manner.\n\nSinyangwe said there is frustration from some people at the slowness of legislation, and he understands that. He said there is another common misconception about this movement, that nothing is happening. He says that's not true.\n\n\"Change is happening. And we will get free, but it is going to be a little while,\" he said. \"What's happening really is unprecedented.\"\n\nSocial Media\n\nSinyangwe says Social Media has been the lifeblood of the movement.\n\n\"People would not have heard about Ferguson if it wasn't for social media. And when I say social media, I mean Twitter,\" he said.\n\nAt least six people have already been killed by police this month. \n\nIt's been 3 days.\n\nMany of the activists have shared personal testimonies on Twitter, organized protests and spread their messages. It has also served as an educational tool for those outside of the movement.\n\n\"I think there is a misconception that the movement started with a hashtag,\" said Sinyangwe. \"I think the movement started with everyday people.\"\n\nBut Sinyangwe says social media has still been powerful.\n\n\"It allows people to organize and build a community where it previously has not been,\" he said.\n\nNational conversation\n\nKayla Reed, 25, is field organizer for the Organization for Black Struggle . She is also a member of the Ferguson Action Council, a collaborative effort and coalition of organizations founded after the death of Michael Brown. She said the group comes together weekly to discuss action planning on the ground. The organization is responsible for the #UNITEDWEFIGHT weekend of events planned in Ferguson for the anniversary of Michael Brown's death.\n\nReed acknowledges that Black Lives Matter has now become a national conversation about race, and political candidates have had to answer questions about it. Most recently, Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton have fielded questions about Black Lives Matter, as well as candidates during the first GOP debate .\n\n\"You are seeing both Republicans and Democrats having to address the issue of police accountability, injustice and the racial inequalities that exist in America in a way you haven't seen before,\" Reed said.\n\nIn late July, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley was heckled on stage by demonstrators at the progressive Netroots Nation convention. The Democratic presidential candidate responded to the Black Lives Matter protesters by saying, \"Black lives matter. White lives matter. All lives matter.\"\n\nHe has since walked back those comments, and, as Sinyangwe points out, he has recently released a comprehensive plan to address some of the issues the Black Lives Matter movement has raised .\n\nWhat's next?\n\nSinyangwe would like to see the passing of a comprehensive package of federal legislation related to policing and criminal justice reform in the next year. In addition, he would like to see policies in police departments passed and enforced such as banning chokeholds, banning nickel rides, emphasizing deescalation, the carrying of non-lethal weapons and prohibiting shooting at moving cars -- to name a few.\n\nPacknett said she too would like to see policies on paper become reality.\n\n\"What I am really looking to see is the foundation that we have laid to really turn into tangible outcomes and changes in peoples everyday lives,\" she said. \"It didn't take just a year to get into this position. So it's going to take more than a year to get out of it.\"\n\nShe said she also hopes to see people continue to be creative, thoughtful and sustained in bringing forth what she calls a 21st Century human rights movement.\n\n\"I want to see us continue to live authentically as our generation does. I want to see some real wins that will help us figure out what the next win will be,\" Packnett said. \"We will get there. We will keep going.\"\n\n© 2015 CBS Interactive Inc.

It came alongside the release of their new song, March March , and its music video, which features the names of Black victims of police brutality.\n\nThey have previously come under fire for making a statement that criticized former President George W. Bush and his decision to invade Iraq, causing their popularity among mostly right-wing country music fans to decline, with some even burning their CDs quickly.\n\n'Dixie' was a term used to refer to southern US states during slavery because of the Mason-Dixon Line, which separated those free and those enslaved at the time and was also the name of a blackface minstrel character dating back to the 1850s. Then in the 1940s, it was adopted by the Dixiecrats or The States' Rights Democratic, a right-wing segregationist party primarily active in the south.\n\nDixie was also the name of a song sung by Confederate soldiers during the Civil War. The same song was part of the 1915 Birth of a Nation's score, which helped revive the KKK. In the 1950s, it was sung by white women protesting against integration in schools.\n\nIn Utah, Dixie State University will also have its name changed following a unanimous vote by the Utah Board of Higher Education. The college has previously removed a statue called 'The Rebels' featuring a Confederate soldier holding a Confederate flag on a horse. It also replaced the university's mascot, Rebel to Red Storm and then to Trailblazers, named after Samuel Brooks, the college's first student who slept on the steps outside waiting for it to open.\n\nSources: NPR , Dixie State University , The Atlantic , Distracitfy , 11 Alive\n\nIn a Twitter statement published in June, the band said: \"We are regretful and embarrassed to say that we did not take into the account the associations that weight down this word referencing to the period of history before the Civil War, which includes slavery. We are deeply sorry for the hurt this has caused and for anyone who has felt unsafe, unseen, or undervalued.\"\n\nThey have since been engaged in a feud with 61-year-old blues singer Lady A, who has been using the name professionally for 20 years. The band filed a lawsuit against Anita White at District Court in Tennessee to allow them to use the name, saying that they hold the federal trademarks while the singer doesn't.\n\nWhite pointed out the irony in the band changing their name to highlight racial inequality and taking from a Black woman.\n\nShe told Rolling Stone: \"It shouldn't have taken George Floyd to die for them to realize that their name had a slave reference to it. It's an opportunity for them to pretend they're not racist or pretend this means something to them.\"\n\nSource: Rolling Stone\n\nThe Recording Academy said it would rename the award for \"Best Urban Contemporary Album\" to \"Best Progressive R&B album,\" according to the BBC.\n\nIts word choice had been previously criticized by several musical artists, including rapper Tyler, the Creator, who won of best rap album at the 2020 Grammys and told reporters at the ceremony: \"I don't like that 'urban' word - it's just a politically correct way to say the N-word to me. Why can't we just be in pop?\"\n\nThe food and drink brands Aunt Jemima and Uncle Ben's were both rebranded in June after concerns from the Black community.\n\nThe 130-year-old Aunt Jemima brand is based on a minstrel character and once featured former slave Nancy Green's face on its packaging. In a statement released on June 17 and seen by NBC News , its parent company, Quaker Oats, said that it recognizes that \"Aunt Jemima's origins are based on a racial stereotype.\"\n\nLater that day, Mars Inc. also said that they would be evolving the Uncle Ben's brand after critics pointed out that the terms 'Auntie' and 'Uncle' were often used by white people to refer to Black people during the Jim Crow era to avoid the honorific titles 'Mr.' and 'Mrs.'\n\nIn a statement also seen by NBC News , it said: \"We know we have a responsibility to take a stand in helping to put an end to racial bias and injustices. We know to make the systemic change needed, it's going to take a collective effort from all of us - individuals, communities, and organizations of all sizes around the world.\"\n\nSources: NBC News , Forbes\n\nThe products were advertised as dark-spot reducers, but have been used by many people to brighten their skin color. They were predominantly sold in Asia and the Middle East.\n\nIn a statement, the company wrote: \"Conversations over the past few weeks highlighted that some product names or claims on our Neutrogena and Clean & Clear dark-spot reducer products represent fairness or white as better than your own unique skin tone.\"\n\n\"This was never our intention - healthy skin is beautiful skin.\"\n\nConfederate General Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson's statue was removed from Monument Avenue in Richmond, Virginia.\n\nJackson is considered one of the most successful generals during the American Civil War but also owned six slaves.\n\nFor years, there have been calls for the removal of his statues, particularly from in front of the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) in Lexington, Virginia, where he was once a professor.\n\nAlthough the institute has previously been reluctant to remove the statue, it finally was last month.\n\nSources: NPR , National Geographic , The Washington Post\n\nAt least 33 statues of Christopher Columbus have been removed or are being removed following the BLM movement.\n\nIn St Paul, Minnesota, the state in which George Floyd was murdered, protesters toppled the statue in front of the state capitol.\n\nAlthough Columbus is credited with discovering America, indigenous people had been living there for some 15,000 years.\n\nHe also enslaved and killed thousands of indigenous people in the Caribbean and South America during his four voyages.\n\nSources: CBS News , Smithsonian Magazine\n\nWoodrow Wilson served as US President between 1913 to 1921. His childhood home in Columbia, South Carolina, was formerly called the Woodrow Wilson Family Home but has now been renamed The Museum of Reconstruction Era at the Woodrow Wilson Home.\n\nWilson lived there as a teenager between 1871 to 1875, during the Reconstruction era, a period after the civil war which lasted between 1865 to 1977 and was characterized by severe laws against Black people adopted by southern states to prevent potential uprisings.\n\nHis name was also removed from Princeton University's School of Public and International Affairs. University President Christopher L. Eisgruber said in a statement : \"Wilson's racism was significant and consequential even by the standards of his own time.\"\n\nSources: Historic Columbia , The Post and Courier , Princeton University\n\nThe University of California, Berkeley, renamed various buildings this year, including LeConte Hall and Barrows Hall last month.\n\nLeConte was named after brothers John and Joseph LeConte, who came to Berkeley in 1869 from a Southern slave-holding family, served in the Confederacy, and promoted racist ideals.\n\nBarrows was named after the University of California's former President David Prescott Barrows, who said that \"the white, or European, race is, above all others, the great historical race.\"\n\nIn a statement , Chair of the Building Name Review Committee and Integrative biology professor Paul Fine said: \"A truly welcoming institution requires a real investment in making substantive changes to systemic racism, to institutional racism.\"\n\nSource: UC Berkeley\n\nIn August, the NFL's Kansas City Chiefs said that fans would no longer be allowed to wear ceremonial headdresses or indigenous-style face paint at the team's Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nSource: CNN\n\nJump to"

This despite mass gatherings being prohibited in the country as part of its coronavirus response.\n\nPeople were seen carrying signs that read, \"Justice for George Floyd,\" \"Racism has no place,\" \"Enough is enough,\" and \"Black lives matter.\" They chanted, \"I can't breathe\" and \"No justice, no peace,\" and marched to Grenfell Tower, which was felled by a fire in 2017, causing 72 deaths.\n\nProtesters also walked to the US Embassy in Battersea, BBC reported , and were seen in Manchester and Cardiff.\n\nBlack Lives Matter demonstrators gathered at Hyde Park on Wednesday before marching through London to Victoria Station, where they held up signs seeking justice for Belly Mujinga, a railway worker who died after being spat on by a man who claimed to have the coronavirus. The Crown Prosecution Service has made it a criminal offense to weaponize COVID-19, but the case was closed last moth, Politico said .\n\nAn emotional John Boyega, of \"Star Wars\" fame, led a chant of \"No justice, no peace\" and assured other black people, \"We have always meant something.\"\n\nLabor Party politician Barry Gardiner, who had been social distancing since March, said he \"broke it\" on Wednesday for the sake of joining thousands of protesters in taking a knee outside parliament.\n\nAccording to Sky News , the protest began peacefully, but, at one point, emotions ran high and objects and punches were thrown at police. People then calmed down again.\n\nIn Germany, the scene was a familiar one.\n\nA crowd gathered at the US Embassy in Berlin on Saturday. Graffiti artists also sprayed Floyd's image on a stretch of the wall that divided the German capital city for decades during the Cold War.\n\nThe next day, crowds demanded justice in front of the Brandenburg Gate. \"Justice can't wait,\" \"Black futures matter,\" \"Suffocate the racists,\" and \"We are all the same and equal,\" their signs read.\n\nMeanwhile, in France, Floyd's death prompted the family of Adama Traoré to call for protests. The 24-year-old black man was tackled and subdued by police officers and gasped \"I can't breathe\" before he died, according to The New York Times .\n\nThe advocacy group La Vérité Pour Adama - which in English means \"The truth for Adama\" - wrote on Facebook : \"How can you not think of Adama's terrible suffering, who had 3 police on him and told them 'I can't breathe.' ... His name was George Floyd, just like Adama, dead because they were BLACK!\"\n\nThousands of people marched in Marseille in Tuesday, with signs saying, \"Justice for all\" and \"No more murders.\"\n\nIn Paris, however, the scene wasn't quite as calm.\n\nTuesday was the first day that French cafes were allowed to resume business after three months of lockdown due to the pandemic. But it was also a day that was marked by reports of arson, violence, and tear gas as tension bubbled over in the French capital city.\n\nCampaigners requested permission from authorities to hold this protest, but were denied, because no more than 10 people are allowed to gather at a time amid coronavirus restrictions in France. They defied authorities to protest racial injustice and police violence.\n\nDemonstrators took a knee and raised their fists to pay homage to Floyd and Traore, but some lit multiple blazes and torched bicycles and electric scooters, an action that pitted them against riot police, who used tear gas to disperse the crowds, according to TIME .\n\n\"Today we are not just talking about the fight of the Traore family. It is the fight for everyone. When we fight for George Floyd, we fight for Adam Traoré. What is happening in the United States is an echo of what is happening in France,\" Adama Traoré's older sister Assa Traoré told the crowd, the Independent reported .\n\nIn Italy, protesters made their way over to the US Embassy in Milan, with signs that declared, \"Stop killing black people,\" \"Say his name,\" and \"We will not be silent.\"\n\nPhotos from the scene show people kneeling and standing with their hands squeezing their necks and \"I can't breathe\" written on their face masks.\n\nIn Dublin, thousands demonstrated outside the US Embassy, while a peaceful protest was also organized at the residence of the US ambassador in Phoenix Park, according to RTÉ News .\n\nThe rallying cry for \"No justice, no peace\" reached Krakow on Wednesday with people leaving flowers and placards that paid respect to Floyd outside the US Consulate General.\n\nIn Warsaw on Thursday, thousands were armed with signs asserting, \"The slaughter of black people must be stopped by any means necessary,\" \"Racism is the pandemic,\" and \"It's not white vs. black, it's everyone vs. racism.\" People also kneeled outside the US Embassy, with one fist raised in the air.\n\nThousands in Copenhagen flooded the streets on Sunday to march peacefully and raise awareness ab0ut police brutality. They walked from the US Embassy to the Danish Parliament building, where they took a knee in solidarity with other Black Lives Matter and Floyd protesters.\n\nThe goal, some wrote on Twitter, was to apply international pressure on governments to treat citizens equally and better.\n\nA massive crowd, with some estimates saying there were 10,000 people, filled Dam Square in Amsterdam on Monday, with demonstrators showing their support for their American counterparts.\n\nTheir signs read, \"Love black lives the way you love black culture,\" \"Racism is a pandemic,\" \"My skin ain't a crime,\" \"Police violence is not an accident,\" and \"Who do we call when cops kill?\"\n\nActivist Naomie Pieter called out to the crowd from a stage, \"Black women's lives, black trans lives, black disabled lives,\" and demonstrators replied, \"Matter!\", NPR reported .\n\nHundreds in Tel Aviv rallied alongside American protesters, communicating their displeasure at the heavy-handedness of police around the world and the unequal treatment of people of color with signs that read, \"F--- Trump,\" \"Please, I can't breathe,\" \"Down with racism,\" \"Black lives matter here, there and everywhere,\" and \"AmeriKKKa you did this!\"\n\nThey also demanded justice for two other black people who have been killed in the US in recent months, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor .\n\nOn June 3, 2019, Sudanese security forces cracked down on pro-democracy protesters in the capital city of Khartoum, killing as many as 241 people, Al Jazeera reported .\n\nThis year, on the first anniversary of the massacre, protesters held up signs in Arabic that said, \"Our martyrs are not dead, they are alive with the revolutionaries\" along with the English slogans \"#BLUEforSUDAN\" and \"#BLACKLIVESMATTER.\"\n\nCloser to home, in Canada, protests were also sparked by the death of Regis Korchinski-Paquet, a 29-year-old black woman, who fell from her balcony and died on Wednesday as police were investigating a domestic incident at her building, CBC News reported .\n\nDemonstrations in Toronto on Saturday in honor of Korchinski-Paquet dovetailed with calls to end racism around the world, according to Vox .\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters on Friday that Canadians ar watching the events that are unfolding in the US \"with shock and with horror,\" the Guardian reported .\n\n\"Anti-black racism - racism - is real,\" he added. \"It's in the United States but it's also in Canada and we know people are facing systemic discrimination, unconscious bias, and anti-black racism every single day.\"\n\nA group of protesters gathered outside South Africa's parliament in Cape Town to demand justice for Floyd on the same day that Minneapolis Attorney General Keith Ellison added a second-degree murder charge against arresting officer Derek Chauvin , who also faces third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter charges. The three other officers have also been charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.\n\nThe demonstrators carried flowers and signs that said, \"The system was never broken, it was built this way,\" \"White silence = violence,\" \"Say their names,\" and \"It's a white men's world.\"\n\nNaledi Pandor, the country's international relations minister, said, \"The regrettable death of [George Floyd] presents the USA with an opportunity to address fundamental issues of human rights such as freedom dignity and equality,\" according to the Anadolu Agency .\n\nIn Rio de Janeiro, hundreds of masked demonstrators descended on the square in front of the state government building and protested the government of President Jair Bolsonaro and crimes committed against people of color in the city's slums, also called favelas.\n\nTheir rallying cry was \"I can't breathe! I can't breathe!\" - a chant that echoed multiple cities in the US. Their signs, written in Portuguese, read, \"Stop killing us\" and \"Favela asks for peace.\"\n\n\"We are here today because we want to live. We are here today because we are tired of this genocidal state. We are here to say no more, no more!\" an activist Santiago told Voice of America .\n\nPolice threw tear gas at the crowd to end the protest.\n\nPeople in New Zealand on Monday joined the chorus of criticism reverberating around the US.\n\nAround 2,000 people marched to the US Embassy in Auckland, carrying signs that said, \"I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired,\" \"You can kill the revolutionary, not the revolution,\" \"Not today Karen,\" and, \"What's wrong with your skin color?\"\n\nImages show people kneeling in solidarity with their fists raised in the air, while a haka - a ceremonial Maori dance - was also performed.\n\nRTE News reported that another 500 gathered in Christchurch and around the same number of people held a vigil at the Parliament building in Wellington.\n\nA self-proclaimed white supremacist gunned down 51 people at mosques in Christchurch in March 2019, prompting Josephine Varghese to tell the crowd on Monday, \"We demand racial and economic justice. Black lives matter, indigenous lives matter, Muslim lives matter,\" according RTE News.\n\nProtests are expected later this week in Australia.\n\nAn Aboriginal man, David Dungay, said \"I can't breathe\" 12 times while being restrained by prison guards in 2015. He died, and the video of Floyd's killing has been traumatic for his family, The Times reported .\n\nSocial unrest in the US has prompted Australians to highlight the fact that 400-plus Indigenous Australians have died in police custody since 1991. None of the police officers have faced consequences for their conduct, per The Times.\n\nHowever, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said during a radio interview on Monday that \"there's no need to import things happening in other countries here to Australia.\"\n\nPeople shut down his comments immediately.\n\nChina had a slightly different reaction to the protests in the US. The Times reported that Floyd's death and the resulting riots were featured prominently on state-run news outlets and the social media platform Weibo. After President Donald Trump was rushed to a bunker in the White House as protests in Washington, DC, intensified, \"BunkerBoy\" was trending on Chinese social media platforms.\n\nHu Xijin, the editor-in-chief of nationalist publication Global Times, wrote on Saturday : \"Mr. President, don't go hide behind the Secret Service. Go to talk to the demonstrators seriously. Negotiate with them, just like you urged Beijing to talk to Hong Kong rioters.\"\n\nAnd, on Sunday, China's foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying shared \"I can't breathe\" on Twitter. Attached was a screenshot of Morgan Ortagus, a spokesperson for the US Department of State, condemning the Chinese Communist Party for cracking down on Hong Kong.\n\nSimilarly, Iran responded by highlighting the US's hypocrisy.\n\nJavad Zarif, the foreign minister, posted to Twitter an edited screenshot of a 2018 statement by American officials criticizing the country's \"tactics of suppression, imprisonment of protesters, and the denial of Iranians' frustrations.\" The references to Iran were crossed out in red and replaced with America.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "17 celebrities who have faced backlash for their responses to George Floyd's death and Black Lives Matter protests\n\nCelebrities have some of the most far-reaching platforms on social media. So when George Floyd died at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis, Minnesota, people hoped that famous figures would use their resources to raise awareness about the Black Lives Matter movement, donate money, and set an example for others.\n\nAnd while some celebrities, like Ariana Grande, Halsey, and Kendrick Sampson, have attended the Black Lives Matter protests across the country and leveraged their platforms to address racial inequality in America, others have not.\n\nDavid Guetta, for example, remixed a version of Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech in a \"tone-deaf\" tribute to Floyd. And Madonna contributed a video of her son dancing to Michael Jackson's song \"They Don't Really Care About Us\" to \"honor\" Floyd and his family.\n\nInsider listed 17 celebrities who have been criticized for their words and behavior in the midst of the ongoing Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nThe rapper faced backlash after saying that people should blame themselves for police brutality rather than police or other races.\n\n\"I think we also have to understand that we have to get very specific. We have to get so specific. What I mean by that - we have to stop viewing it with such a broad view, meaning we have to stop placing the blame on the whole force and everybody of a certain race, everybody with a badge,\" he said during an Instagram Live with Fat Joe on May 28.\n\nWayne continued, \"We have to actually get into who that person is, and if we want to place the blame on anybody, it should be ourselves for not doing more than what we think we're doing.\"\n\nThe \"Lollipop\" rapper stated that while some people \"think they did something\" by tweeting or wearing a shirt about the Black Lives Matter movement, it's more important to \"learn about it more.\"\n\n\"What we need to do is learn about it more. If we want to scream about something, know what we screaming about. We want to protest something, know what we protesting about,\" he said, adding, \"There's a bunch of facts that we think we know that we don't know.\"\n\nWhile some people supported Wayne's desire to learn more about the issues, many criticized him for insinuating that black people were at fault for police brutality instead of looking more deeply at systemic racism .\n\nAbloh was ridiculed for making a $50 donation to bail funds in Miami, Florida, on May 31.\n\n\"i'm crazy inspired. for kids in the streets that need bail funds for George Floyd protests,\" he wrote on the receipt on his Instagram story, disclosing the donation amount.\n\nAfter viewing his contribution, people pointed out that $50 doesn't cover the cost of one pair of socks made by Abloh's brand Off-White . One person noted that some of the socks cost $100 and tweeted, \"He spent a half a sock on protestors.\"\n\nThe first lines of his Wikipedia page were changed to include \"Mr. 50$\" and \" Cheap A-- .\" Someone also edited the \" Personal Life \" section of his page. They wrote, \"He donated a whooping amount of 50$ to urge on protesters who protested the unlawful killing of George Floyd.\"\n\nAbloh responded to the backlash with a statement on Instagram addressing the criticism about his donation.\n\nHe wrote, \"I can understand your frustration if you think my contributions were limited to $50. Purely false when it comes to the total. I have donated $20,500 to bail funds and other causes related to this movement.\"\n\nAbloh also faced backlash for criticizing looting, for which he also apologized, saying, \"I apologize that it seemed like my concern for those stores outweighed my concern for our right to protest injustice and express our anger and rage in this moment.\"\n\nAfter Guetta released a tribute to George Floyd using a remixed version of Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech on May 30, viewers were left confused and shocked.\n\nGuetta performed the mash-up atop a Manhattan rooftop during a livestream concert for coronavirus relief.\n\n\"The world is going through difficult times and America too, actually. Last night, I knew we were going to do this and I made a special record in honor of George Floyd. I really hope we can see more unity and more peace when already things are so difficult,\" he said, adding, \"Shout out to his family.\"\n\nThe song then picked up volume, and samples of King's \"I Have a Dream\" speech played.\n\nIn response, people called the video \"the whitest way to react to racism\" and mocked the DJ for trying to \"oontz oontz racism away.\" Others were at a loss for words , saying they were left \"speechless.\"\n\nThe singer, who goes by the mononym Marina, upset many of her followers after saying that people had to be \"mentally ill\" to be a police offer in a tweet she shared on May 31.\n\nPeople quickly took issue with Diamandis' message, stating that she was trying to link two topics that aren't related.\n\n\"I understand what you're trying to say but please don't conflate mental health issues with police brutality. There is no link and this is tone deaf,\" one person wrote .\n\nOthers pointed out that people with mental health issues are often subject to discrimination and asked her not to villainize them.\n\nMadonna was mocked after posting a video of her son dancing to \"honor\" Floyd on May 28.\n\n\"Brutal murder travels around the world my son David Dances to honor and pay tribute to George and His Family and all Acts of Racism and Discrimination that happen on a daily basis in America. #davidbanda #JusticeforGeorgeFloyd #MichaelJackson,\" she tweeted.\n\nIn the video, David Banda Mwale Ciccone Ritchie, who Madonna adopted from Malawi in 2006, dances to Michael Jackson's song \"They Don't Really Care About Us.\"\n\nComparing the video to Kendall Jenner's 2017 Pepsi commercial , in which the white supermodel resolves a protest by handing a police officer a can of soda, many people said that the pop star's response wasn't appropriate.\n\n\"I really appreciate you for allowing your son to dance away the racism for us,\" one person wrote in response to the video.\n\nCelebrities such as Kendall Jenner, Cara Delevigne, and Kylie Jenner reposted a Black Lives Matter chain on their Instagram stories following Floyd's death.\n\nWith each repost, they each tagged 10 of their friends who \"will not break the black lives matter chain.\"\n\nAlthough they were attempting to spread awareness about the Black Lives Matter movement and have shared other educational content to their social media accounts, people called them out for \" playing a game \" and being \" self-serving .\"\n\n\"unemployed college students are literally on a donating spree while celebrities are wiping the sweat off their forehead after just posting 'BLM' on their IG story,\" one person tweeted .\n\nThe Colombian singer faced backlash after tweeting a photo of her black-and-white dog to make a point about racial inequality.\n\nShe wrote in a since-deleted tweet , \"El ejemplo perfecto de que el Blanco y el Negro JUNTOS se ven hermosos,\" which translates to, \"The perfect example of white and black together they look beautiful.\" She added the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter.\n\nAfter receiving criticism for using an animal to promote racial equality, the singer issued an apology on Twitter.\n\n\"I was wrong and I apologize. I want to make clear that my intentions were right in the photo I posted earlier. I meant to say that racism is terrible and I cannot begin to understand it,\" she wrote.\n\nKarol G added, \"I am still learning and taking active steps to help, aid and evoke change and I continue educating myself to understand the experience.\"\n\n\"Can one of you guys photoshop together a dog and a fish to create a fish-dog hybrid for me because I need this don't ask me why. I'd appreciate it a lot thanks,\" the \"Say So\" singer tweeted on May 27 .\n\nFans quickly criticized Doja Cat for ignoring current events, specifically the protests occurring across the nation as a result of George Floyd's death.\n\n\"Hi racist, post about #BlackLivesMatters,\" one user commented , while another said , \"Ain't mentioned George Floyd once but asking for a imaginary hybrid animal.\" One tweet just asked , \"How about you speak out on what's happening right now instead?\"\n\nThe singer eventually asked fans to send over a \"petition\" (ostensibly one meant to combat police brutality) in response to the backlash.\n\nA few days earlier, Doja came under fire after users discovered her \"racist past,\" accusing her of using racial slurs and making fun of black speech patterns . She subsequently denied the allegations.\n\n\"Look... all I'm saying is.. in the MOMENT.. when we are experiencing racism.. can We the black community find ways to avoid being killed? Or hunted,\" Moore tweeted on May 28.\n\nThe actor shared a \"very strong opinion\" with his followers in a subsequent tweet , writing, \"See I have a very strong opinion that the black community hates to hear.. but needs to hear... we need to learn how to deal with police... and or racism... because THIS is the part of the scenario we have failed to fix.\"\n\nUnsurprisingly, people on Twitter didn't appreciate Moore's tone-deaf comments about the situation, telling him, \"bro. read the room. your hot take is unnecessary rn\" and \" We aren't going out there on a mission to be killed .\"\n\nMoore later apologized for his comments on during an Instagram livestream , saying his comments \"were taken out of context.\"\n\n\"Again, I'll just say for the people watching: I did not mean to offend any of the Black community,\" he told viewers. \"It was wrong timing.\"\n\nAfter the \"Young and Beautiful\" singer shared videos of Los Angeles protesters looting stores to her Instagram (and disabled comments on the clips), Kehlani and Tinashe both called out Del Rey for her \"dangerous\" posts, according to Page Six .\n\n\"Please remove your instagram post it's dangerous as f--- and a very poor choice of moments to post,\" Kehlani reportedly tweeted . \"By all means protest, but DO NOT endanger people with your very massive platform. oh and turn your f---ing comments on man.\"\n\n\"Why the f--- are you posting people looting stores on your page literally WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM,\" Tinashe reportedly said in her tweet .\n\nDel Rey apparently deleted one of the two videos, and both Kehlani and Tinashe appear to have deleted their tweets calling her out. Tinashe even thanked the \"National Anthem\" singer on Twitter for removing one of the posts.\n\nEarlier in the month, fans also called out Del Rey for \"tearing down\" female artists (most of whom are not white) in an attempt to defend herself against critics. The singer subsequently denied the accusations .\n\nThe rapper's tweet (\"Imagine how people raising bi racial children feel right now!!!!!! This is crazy!!!!!!\") didn't go over well with some of his Twitter followers, who accused him of minimizing the problem of violence against black people.\n\n\"What does this have to do with George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery or Breonna Taylor? They're not biracial,\" one user responded , while another simply told the rapper, \"Delete this.\"\n\nAnd others focused on the fact that LL Cool J's daughter Samaria is reportedly in a relationship with actor Shameik Moore, who himself was called out for tone-deaf comments about the black community.\n\n\"Sir your daughters boyfriend was on live saying Rosa Parks should've taken a cab. Go worry about that,\" a user said .\n\nThe rapper appeared on television, along with Killer Mike and Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, to condemn the violence and looting occurring in the city.\n\n\"We can't do this here, this is Wakanda. It must be protected,\" T.I. told press and viewers.\n\nBut almost immediately, the rapper was lambasted on Twitter, mostly for comparing a real-life city to a fictional utopia . People also took issue with the fact that T.I. is seemingly supporting elected officials and police , instead of black protesters on the front lines.\n\nScreenshots of the tweet, which was apparently posted on May 30, appear to show DeGeneres advocating for racial equality and denouncing \"injustice\" after protests broke out in response to the death of George Floyd .\n\n\"Like so many of you, I am angry and I am sad,\" DeGeneres wrote, according to screenshots . \"People of color in this country have faced injustice for far too long. For things to change, things must change.\"\n\n\"We must commit ourselves to this change with conviction and love,\" the message read.\n\nEven though DeGeneres' message seemed like it was meant to inspire unity, it actually had the opposite effect. Some people called out the host for her friendship with former president George W. Bush, who's been called a \"war criminal\" by some due to his military actions while president.\n\nOthers took issue with the fact that DeGeneres broadly referred to the injustices faced by \"people of color\" in the US, even though the current movement is primarily focused on violence experienced by the black community.\n\nAfter tweeting that she was getting emotional while watching people \"burn down\" Santa Monica, Pratt took things a step further and called for the so-called \"looters\" to be shot .\n\n\"Shoot the looters - using this tragedy as their excuse to rob and burn all of our towns down,\" she wrote in the since-deleted tweet.\n\nImmediately after Pratt tweeted the controversial statement, Twitter users criticized the actress for her \"racist\" and tone-deaf language . The majority of users focused on Pratt's hypocrisy since she was arrested on charges of second-degree theft after shoplifting $1,300 worth of clothing from a Neiman Marcus in Hawaii in 2006.\n\nPratt seemingly tried to clarify her comments in a subsequent tweet (that's also been deleted) on June 1, telling followers, \"There's some confusion between the words looter & protester on the news.\"\n\n\"The protesters are trying to make changes & end decades long police violence which we ALL WANT,\" she continued in the now-deleted tweet seen by Insider. \"Looters, however are a--holes.\"\n\nThe actress swiftly deleted an Instagram photo she posted of Shirley Temple and Bill Robinson after people described the image as \"racist.\"\n\nHart shared a still from the 1935 film \"The Little Colonel,\" showing the stars holding hands and smiling.\n\n\"The post of Mr. Rogers by Danica McKellar reminded me of one of my favorite Shirley Temple movies, The Little Colonel because of the history of the stair dance she did with the incredible Billy 'Bojangles' Robinson,\" she wrote.\n\nHart continued, \"When studying the life of Shirley, I learned that it was the first time an interracial couple danced on screen together. Bojangles wasn't allowed to hold her hand but Shirley grabbed his anyhow during the dance and it made history.\"\n\nHer followers pointed out that the film took place on a plantation and contained multiple examples of racial insensitivity. Hart responded to several of the comments to defend her decision to share the photo, however she ultimately deleted it and replaced the post with a Bible verse .\n\nLike many other celebrities, Watson participated in Blackout Tuesday and posted three black squares in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nHowever, fans took issue with the fact that she appeared to add a white border to them to match her previous posts, which were white squares . Watson also didn't link to any additional resources or appear to donate money, leading people to label her posts as \"performative\" and criticize her for not further leveraging her platform .\n\nOthers stood up for her , noting that she's a United Nations Women Goodwill Ambassador and has spoken up about racial inequality in the past.\n\nHours later, the \"Harry Potter\" actress wrote that she \"was holding off posting until #blackouttuesday ended in the UK\" and shared a poem called \"White Lies, Subtleties, Micro-Aggressions, and Other Choking Hazards\" ⁣ along with art by Dr. Fahamu Pecou .\n\nThe \"American Horror Story\" actor issued an apology after people criticized him for retweeting a video of a physical altercation between a police officer and a protester.\n\nThe tweet said, \"I can watch these piece of s--- looters get tackled all day!!\"\n\nSeeing Evans retweet the violent video led many of his followers to call him \"racist\" and express their disappointment.\n\nIn response, the actor apologized and said he \"unknowingly retweeted\" the video.\n\n\"I don't condone the guy watching the news at all in the video which I have deleted. I unknowingly retweeted it. I'm deeply upset it got on my newsfeed. I sincerely apologize if anyone was offended. I support black lives matter wholeheartedly,\" he said.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "A former HFPA president called Black Lives Matter a 'racist hate movement' and attacked one of its founders\n\nA former president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association called Black Lives Matter a \"racist hate movement\" and described co-founder Patrisse Cullors as \"the self-proclaimed 'trained Marxist,'\" the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nFormer HFPA president and current member Philip Berk, 88, sent an email to organization members and staff, including general counsel and chief operating officer Gregory Goeckner, attacking Cullors and the BLM movement.\n\nThe Times reported that Berk didn't cite any sources in the email but appeared to be referencing an article titled \" BLM Goes Hollywood \" published on conservative commentator David Horowitz's website last week.\n\nThe article attacked Cullors for buying a $1.4-million home a year after \"race rioters burned buildings and terrorized communities.\"\n\n\"The house is down the road from one of the homes involved in the Manson murders which seems only appropriate since Manson wanted to start a race war. And Black Lives Matter is carrying on Manson's work,\" the post said about the Topanga Canyon home.\n\nIt additionally attacked Cullors and BLM for alleged Hollywood connections.\n\n\"The founders of BLM have gone to work acting, writing, consulting, and promoting for Hollywood because their racist hate movement was always an entertainment industry production. BLM's race riots destroyed communities and small businesses, but its brands and buzzwords were a corporate marketing campaign backed by industry talent,\" the post said.\n\nInsider has attempted to reach Cullors for comment. Last week, she called the post \"false and defamatory\" and said it was an effort to \"discredit and harass\" her and her family.\n\n\"Since its inception, the HFPA has dedicated itself to bridging cultural connections and creating further understanding of different backgrounds through film and TV. The views expressed in the article circulated by Mr. Berk are those of the author of the article and do not - in any way shape or form - reflect the views and values of the HFPA. The HFPA condemns all forms of racism, discrimination, and hate speech and finds such language and content unacceptable,\" the organization told Insider in an emailed statement.\n\nOn Tuesday, HFPA added: \"Effective immediately, Phil Berk is no longer a member of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.\"\n\nThe Times reported that many members responded by asking to be removed from the email chain.\n\nDespite the pushback, Berk responded with no remorse for his statement. \"I'm hearing from my sworn enemies. No surprise,\" he said.\n\nHFPA has been under pressure since Variety reported in February that the organization, which decides who will win a Golden Globe, did not have any Black members since 2002.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "14 ways to support Black Lives Matter protests if you can't be there in person\n\nProtests in support of the Black Lives Matter movement have now made their way into every corner of the United States, and they've even erupted across the world . The consecutive deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor have sparked protests against police brutality and systemic racism .\n\nWhile the protests continue, the US is still battling COVID-19. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that while people have a right to demonstrate, close-proximity gatherings, shouting, and crowd-controlling irritants that lead to coughing and rubbing of the eyes may increase the spread of the virus.\n\nSome Black Lives Matter advocates do not feel comfortable protesting. Ines Aguerre, a New York resident who works at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital, told Insider, \"I'm making the conscious decision not to [protest] because I work with patients with autoimmune diseases who are at a higher risk for coronavirus, and I don't want to risk infecting them.\" Instead, Aguerre said she is using her time after work to educate herself and her family, while also donating to organizations that support Black Lives Matter.\n\nHere are 14 impactful ways to support the movement from home.\n\nProviding essential supplies for protesters can go a long way. Amnesty International has a list of recommended essentials for protesters, including masks, shatter-resistant eye protection, other personal protective equipment, water, energy snacks, and first aid kits.\n\nFrom home, you can sew masks, make posters, gather first aid kits, and purchase snacks and water. Some protests have supply drop-off stations , and if not clearly stated, you can contact the protest organizer or an attendee to collect the supplies .\n\nIf you know members of your community are heading out to a protest, offer to be their emergency contact . As support, you carry the responsibility of ensuring your team gets home safely, and should check in every couple of hours.\n\nUsing apps like 5-0 Radio , Broadcastify Pro , and Police Scanner Radio & Fire 4+ you can also monitor police presence to update protesters. According to Vice , \"The number of users of an app which lets people listen in to police radio broadcasts across the country is nearly doubling every day during the protests.\"\n\nIn response to arrests at protests, people are donating to bail funds, which \" help protesters stay out of police custody while they await trial. \"\n\nWhen someone is held in jail for being unable to pay, the impact can be detrimental. As Business Insider previously reported , \"people detained pretrial can lose their jobs, fall behind in school, be unable to take care of family, and are more likely to be convicted.\" Plus, black and Latino individuals typically face fines that are \"35% and 19% higher, respectively, than whites who have been accused of similar crimes, while simply being black increases someone's odds of being held in jail pretrial by 25%, according to the Pretrial Justice Institute .\"\n\nThe National Bail Fund Network has compiled over 60 community bail and bond funds across the country and regularly updates the list . Other lists of bail funds and related resources include Resistance Map , Bail Out Network , and The Bail Project .\n\nSigning petitions online or through text message shows solidarity for an assortment of causes, and it's a way to get involved if you are unable to donate money or time.\n\nThe Change.org petition demanding justice for George Floyd and the attention of Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey and Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman has over 19 million signatures. The petition is now the largest US petition in the history of Change.org.\n\nThere are petitions for a variety of causes, including a national action against police brutality . Petitions can be found all across Change.org and social media.\n\nUSA.gov has direct links to help you find your local officials' contact information, where you can advocate for issues such as nondiscriminatory policies. If you are looking for talking points, NAACP and Black Lives Matter have key policy changes outlined on their site.\n\nUse your purchasing power to invest in Black communities and raise up artists, business owners, designers, chefs, and entrepreneurs. Insider previously reported on the different apps that can help guide you in the right direction. There are restaurant directories that connect you to Black-owned restaurants and online marketplaces that promote Black-owned businesses, especially home goods, clothing, and books.\n\nDuring the month of June, Bandcamp , a popular online music company, waived artist fees in support of Black Lives Matter. They also created this Google sheet with over 1,000 new artists to discover new music, and the sheet remains a great resource to support the Black community.\n\nArtnet has also compiled a list of 25 organizations that help support Black artists, change-makers, and creators.\n\nInsider previously shared some lists of books , documentaries, movies , and podcasts to educate yourself.\n\nHowever you choose to educate yourself, it is important to spend some time with what you are learning. As NPR says , \"Information is power - you decide what you do with it.\"\n\nIf you've found yourself spending more time on social media, take this as an opportunity to follow more people of color and hear from voices outside of your community of friends and family.\n\nA few activists to start with include Adwoa Aboah , Blair Imani , Bree Newsome Bass , Rachel Cargle , Opal Tometi , Austin Channing Brown , and Sonya Renee Taylor .\n\nAlongside educating yourself, opening a dialogue with friends and family members about your role in society is especially important. Embrace the inevitable discomfort of the conversation and welcome any opposing opinions.\n\nElizabeth McCorvey , a North Carolina-based therapist who created a guide for white therapists to discuss race , previously told Insider that \"it's a tough conversation [to have], even when you're super connected with your family, and especially if you've never talked about race before.\"\n\nOne tip from McCorvey is to cite examples within your own community, giving family members and friends an opportunity to connect to something they are more familiar with.\n\nAlleviating any external obstacles so that other people can protest could be a tremendous help. Do you have skills that would benefit others? Lawyers , for example, are representing arrested protesters pro-bono. If you are a nanny and your state's social distancing guidelines allow it, offer childcare services for a few hours.\n\nAs former President Barack Obama emphasized, \"aspirations have to be translated into specific laws and institutional practices - and in a democracy, that only happens when we elect government officials who are responsive to our demands.\"\n\nTo register yourself to vote, visit Vote.org , which walks you through the step-by-step process. Consider also signing up for a mail-in ballot so that you don't put your health at risk by voting in person.\n\nIf you still want to feel connected to a community of advocates, try tuning in to a virtual protest. Usually, word of virtual rallies and meetings can be found across social media.\n\nThis past weekend, Black Lives Matter London hosted a virtual protest. The Guardian reported that 22,000 people from all over the world tuned in to the online rally using Zoom, Facebook Live, and Instagram.\n\nLocal government officials are also hosting virtual town halls , where constituents can ask questions and have their voices heard.\n\nIf you still want to feel connected to a community of advocates, try tuning in to a virtual protest.

      "text": "Photos show how the Black Lives Matter protests compare to civil rights demonstrations in the 1960s\n\nProtests began in Minneapolis on Tuesday, May 26, following the death of George Floyd .\n\nFloyd, 46, died on May 25 after a white police officer knelt on his neck as Floyd begged the officer to stop and told him he couldn't breathe.\n\nProtesters in Minneapolis were seen standing unarmed across from a group of officers, who held batons and hid behind face shields.\n\nIn 1968, strikers and supporters gathered to protest the horrible working conditions and treatment of sanitation workers in Memphis, Tennessee. The sanitation workers' strike is actually what brought Martin Luther King Jr. to Memphis , where he was assassinated on April 4.\n\nSanitation workers marched on Memphis' Beale Street in the photo, wearing identical signs that say \"I Am A Man,\" highlighting the inhumanity with which they were treated by the state.\n\nThe National Guard was deployed to try to contain the protests.\n\nProtests spread to California on the Wednesday following Floyd's death. They marched all over the city, even briefly taking over the LA highway .\n\nIn this photo, three protesters sat in the middle of an intersection, with a larger group of demonstrators behind them. The woman in the middle held a sign that says \"We can't breathe.\"\n\nProtesters across the country have chanted \"I can't breathe,\" the final words uttered by both Floyd and Eric Garner , who died after he was held in a choke hold by a New York City police officer in 2014.\n\nIn 1963, more than 200,000 demonstrators gathered in DC for the March on Washington, where Martin Luther King Jr. gave his famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech .\n\nAhead of the gathering at the Lincoln Memorial, dozens of protesters marched through the city, carrying signs that called for civil rights legislation and jobs for black Americans.\n\nProtests across Washington, DC, escalated and became violent on Sunday night, with the White House going dark as protesters gathered in front of it and set fires nearby.\n\nThe man in this photo faced the White House, looking toward the police force standing in front of the building with his hand raised in a fist, the symbol of the Black Power movement.\n\nIn 1969, around 500 students from Central State University protested the school's limit on the number of out-of-state students admitted to the college. The demonstrators gathered at the Ohio State House.\n\nAlmost every member of the large group raised their hands in protest.\n\nThe protests in DC became violent on Sunday, with activists setting fires around the White House, looting stores downtown, and vandalizing monuments.\n\nPolice officers dressed in face coverings and armed with shields launched tear gas and rubber bullets at the protesters.\n\nIn 1965, protesters marched from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, to demand equal voting rights. The march turned violent on Sunday, March 7, otherwise known as \"Bloody Sunday,\" when demonstrators were met by the authorities on the Edmund Pettus Bridge, who attacked them with billy clubs and tear gas .\n\nThis photo was taken just before the violence started, as a mass of police officers formed a barricade to block the demonstrators from continuing on their march.\n\nPhiladelphia is one of many cities currently dealing with violence and looting, with some stores choosing not to open because of the protests.\n\nIn this photo, two Philadelphia police officers apprehended a protester. One officer held him down to the ground, while the other stands over them.\n\nIn 1968, protesters gathered at the Supreme Court as part of the Poor People's Campaign, an effort organized by Martin Luther King Jr. to spotlight black people suffering from poverty throughout the United States. At the demonstration shown in the photo, four police officers arrested a protester, holding him from behind with batons in hand.\n\nThe protests have spread to St. Louis, where the downtown area and highways have been shut down by large groups of demonstrators.\n\nAt the end of the march from Selma to Montgomery, protesters gathered at the Alabama State Capitol, where Martin Luther King Jr. gave his \"Our God is Marching On\" speech , which marked a turning point in the civil rights movement.\n\n\"How long? Not long, because no lie can live forever. How long? Not long, you shall reap what you sow. How long? Not long,\" King said in his speech.\n\nHe continued: \"How long? Not long, because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.\"\n\nPolice officers' use of force increased as the protests in DC became more violent on Sunday. For instance, in this shot, a protester struggles on the ground as an officer points at him using his baton.\n\nRiots broke out in Harlem, New York, in 1964 when a white, off-duty police officer shot and killed a 15-year-old black student, as NPR reported. The protests quickly turned violent, as this photo shows. A police officer strikes at a protester, as the man raises his hands to protect himself against the baton.\n\nProtesters started setting fires to buildings in Minneapolis on the Thursday following George Floyd's death, with the police meanwhile escalating the violent demonstrations across the city with the use of tear gas and rubber bullets.\n\nRiots broke out across the United States after Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, with his supporters taking to the streets to protest his murder, according to History . This photo shows a building burning in Harlem during the riots in 1968.\n\nBefore the protests in Minneapolis escalated - with a truck driving through a crowd of protesters on the highway on Sunday - they were largely peaceful.\n\nFor instance, a photographer captured two protesters calmly standing on a raised surface, setting them apart from the countless people surrounding them.\n\nThe 1966 national director of the Congress of Racial Equality is at the forefront of this shot, standing alongside protesters calling for voting equality.\n\nIn the 1960s, the Black Power movement was about encouraging black Americans to create cultural, political, and economic power of their own rather than settle for integration into a white-dominated society, according to the National Museum of African American History and Culture .\n\nThe protests in New York also escalated over the weekend, with police cars ramming into protesters and officers using pepper spray on demonstrators.\n\nProtesters also started marching along the bridges between Manhattan and Brooklyn as demonstrations popped up all over the city.\n\nTo protest school segregation, activists marched to Brooklyn from Manhattan in 1964, with many students joining protests over the course of that spring to call for education equality, according to The New York Times .\n\nMuch like their 2020 counterparts, the protesters carried signs and faced the police. The familiar sight of the Manhattan skyline in the background drives home the similarity between the struggles black people faced during the civil rights movement and the issues they face today.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "City crews have begun removing the 'Black Lives Matter' street mural in D.C.\n\nBy\n\nAyana Archie\n\nReconstruction on Black Lives Matter Plaza in Washington, D.C., began Monday. Tyrone Turner/WAMU hide caption\n\nCrews in Washington, D.C., have begun removing the city's \"Black Lives Matter\" street mural, a notable symbol of the 2020 protests against the killing of George Floyd, after a Republican bill targeting the mural threatened city funding.\n\nIn June 2020, the city painted the phrase \"Black Lives Matter\" on the pavement in uppercase, yellow letters covering two blocks on 16th Street, about a quarter mile from the White House.\n\nAccording to a DDOT statement, work on the plaza will take six to eight weeks to complete. Tyrone Turner/WAMU hide caption\n\nWashington, D.C., Mayor Bowser said the plaza will be part of D.C.'s America 250 mural project, \"where we will invite students and artists to create new murals across all eight wards.\" Tyrone Turner/WAMU hide caption\n\nIn 2021, Mayor Muriel Bowser said the mural would become permanent to commemorate the protests. But last week, Rep.

Look back at the iconic street painting\n\nJuliana Kim\n\nBlack Lives Matter Plaza on 16th Street Washington, D.C., is repainted following the removal of the lettering for a construction project on May 13, 2021. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images hide caption\n\nWashington, D.C.'s  iconic \"Black Lives Matter\" street mural, which has served as a powerful symbol of activism and a gathering place for joy and resistance, will soon be gone.\n\nThe decision to remove the enormous mural near the White House comes after a U.S. Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., introduced legislation earlier this week that gave D.C. an ultimatum: either paint over the slogan or risk losing federal funding. The bill also called for the area in downtown D.C. to be re-named from Black Lives Matter Plaza to Liberty Plaza.\n\nThe next day, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser released a statement suggesting that the mural will have to go. \"The mural inspired millions of people and helped our city through a very painful period, but now we can't afford to be distracted by meaningless congressional interference,\" she wrote . The DDOT confirmed on Saturday that plans to remove the mural will begin Monday.\n\nThe mayor's response marked a reversal: She initially declared that the artwork would be permanent .\n\nOn Monday, Bowser told NPR's Morning Edition that the mural helped the nation's capital during a \"very dark time in American history.\"\n\n\"It's going to evolve, absolutely,\" Bowser said, though she did not go into detail about what that would mean.\n\nCity workers repaint Black Lives Matter Plaza on May 13, 2021. Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images hide caption\n\nIn June 2020, amid a nationwide outcry over the death George Floyd, who was killed by a police officer in Minneapolis, the mural was created overnight.\n\nIt was in direct response to reports of federal officers using tear gas against peaceful protesters in D.C.'s Lafayette Square. The demonstrators had been cleared shortly before President Trump walked through the park to St. John's Church, where he posed for a controversial photo-op holding a Bible.\n\nA few days later, the D.C. mayor commissioned a striking 48-foot-wide \"Black Lives Matter\" mural near the site of the altercation. The street painting spanned two blocks of 16th Street, just north of the White House. The mayor also renamed the area Black Lives Matter Plaza and designated it a pedestrian-only zone. In all, the project cost over $4 million .\n\n\"The symbolism is huge. We are saying it loud. We are here. Maybe you didn't hear us before. Maybe you got confused. But the message is clear. Black lives matter, period,\" Keyonna Jones, one of artists who helped paint the mural, told member station WAMU in 2020.\n\nThe mural's unveiling fell on the birthday of Breonna Taylor, a Black medical worker who was killed in March 2020 during a botched raid by police officers in Louisville, Ky. \"Breonna Taylor, on your birthday, let us stand with determination. Determination to make America the land it ought to be,\" Bowser wrote on Twitter on June 5, 2020 .\n\nThat same evening, Trump took to Twitter and called Bowser \"grossly incompetent, and in no way qualified to be running an important city like Washington, D.C.\" Later that night, Bowser posted a video of the mural and wrote, \"We turned on the night light for him so he dreams about #BlackLivesMatter Plaza,\" seemingly referring to Trump.\n\nThe plaza quickly became a popular meeting spot for demonstrations. People gathered or marched through, for an array of reasons including advocating for racial justice, promoting environmental justice, raising awareness of international issues and celebrating Juneteenth.\n\nPeople gather to celebrate Juneteenth in Black Lives Matter Plaza near the White House on June 20, 2023.

A year later, Bowser said that one of her proudest memories of the Black Lives Matter Plaza was when Lewis was able to see the street painting himself before his death.\n\n\"He recognized Black Lives Matter Plaza as good trouble, and we know it will remain a gathering place for reflection, planning and action, as we work toward a more perfect union,\" Bowser said in 2021 .\n\nRep.

After its inception, the D.C. chapter of Black Lives Matter called the mural \"a performative distraction\" by the mayor, accusing her of dismissing the chapter's calls to defund the police and invest in the community.\n\nOn Friday, the group re-posted its initial complaints about the artwork and the mayor, adding, \"We told you so.\"\n\nBut, nationally, the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation condemned the decision to remove the artwork.\n\n\"First, they attacked critical race theory. Then, they banned books. Then DEI, Now they're erasing Black Lives Matter Plaza. Big mistake. You can't erase truth. Republicans hate that they have to walk past it.

As protesters took to the streets in cities across the U.S. in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd, a Black man in Minneapolis, Minn., so did demonstrators in other countries - all with a similar message: Black lives matter.\n\n\"There is a George Floyd in every country,\" South Africa-based journalist Lynsey Chutel tells NPR's David Greene during a recent roundtable interview.\n\nJoining Chutel for Morning Edition 's roundtable are Ana Luisa González, a freelance journalist based in Colombia and Febriana Firdaus, a freelance investigative journalist based in Indonesia. [ To hear the conversation, press the audio button above .]\n\nDemonstrations spread across Colombia in June. They were sparked by the May killing of a young Black man named Anderson Arboleda in Puerto Tejada, who was allegedly beaten to death by police for breaking pandemic rules. Activists called for justice for Arboleda and other young Afro-Latino men killed by police.\n\n\"This message of this movement - Las Vidas Negras Importan - of Black Lives Matter, were young Afro-Colombians who wanted to speak out against police brutality and structural racism,\" Gonzales says. Like much of Latin America, Spanish colonialism informs many societal divisions in Colombia today, she says.\n\nYet, most Colombians don't seem to want to talk about racism and colorism, she says. In the most recent census , a majority of Colombians identified as \"no race\" and \"until we acknowledge this debate, we can't change things,\" Gonzales says.\n\nIn South Africa, demonstrators came together following the police killing of 16-year-old Nathaniel Julies, a boy of mixed heritage with Down syndrome. Julies was shot and killed in August by police near his home in a neighborhood of Soweto allegedly for being outside his home during a pandemic lockdown. Chutel says that in the days after young people marched to the police station out of a sense of \"deep frustration with this police station and the police force in general who are able to behave with impunity.\"\n\nAlliance of Papuan Students are seen protesting in Surabaya, Indonesia, on June 16, 2020.

She says that while protesters directly borrowed some language from the U.S.-based Black Lives Matter Movement, they also made their message uniquely South African by incorporating the phrase \"Colored Lives Matter.\" The word colored , she explains, is an old apartheid segregationist term used to describe someone of mixed heritage in South Africa.\n\nActivists in Indonesia inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement also made the message their own. The phrase #AllPapuanLivesMatter went viral , calling attention to the decades-long secessionist movement in West Papua, which has created tensions between the minority Papuans and ethnic Javanese-majority in the country.\n\n\"It's hard for West Papuans to find a rent house [sic] because they always get rejected,\" Firdaus says. \"The landlord literally says it's because they are Black and they are Christian. We are majority Muslim.\"\n\nFirdaus says ever since Jakarta took control of West Papua from the Dutch in the 1960s as part of the New York Agreement , Indonesia has never allowed Papuans to integrate fully into society. But the #PapuaLivesMatter message might be a turning point \"because many young Indonesians right now feel they are emotionally involved with this issue,\" Firdaus says.\n\nTo hear the conversation, press the audio button above.\n\nAshley Westerman edited and Ryan Benk produced the broadcast version of this story.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Majdi Fathi/NurPhoto via Getty Images hide caption\n\nPeople walk by a mural of George Floyd, whose murder by police in Minneapolis helped ignite worldwide support for the Black Lives Matter movement, in Gaza City, Gaza Strip, in June 2020.\n\nMany Black Lives Matter activists have taken to the streets across the U.S. in recent weeks to voice their support for pro-Palestinian causes, including calls against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and the U.S.-Israel alliance.\n\nThe 11 days of fighting between Israel and Hamas last month - the worst in the region since 2014 - left at least 256 people dead in Gaza, the United Nations reports, and 13 people have died in Israel, according to Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. This latest round of violence has renewed a sense of solidarity with the pro-Palestinian movement among some BLM organizers in the U.S., where sympathy with the Palestinians in the broader conflict has been growing .\n\nBehind the connection between the two movements is a complicated history of a fissure among earlier generations of African American activists that helped form what Zellie Thomas, an organizer with Black Lives Matter in Paterson, N.J., calls a \"Black radical tradition.\"\n\n\"What we're seeing right now is nothing new,\" says Thomas, who leads a local chapter of the decentralized movement for Black lives that echoes prior advocacy for Palestinian rights by the Black Panther Party and Angela Davis.\n\nIn the 1950s, Malcolm X was among the first Black activists to speak out for the \"Arab cause\" in the Arab-Israeli conflict, beginning during his time with the Nation of Islam when he sometimes talked up antisemitic conspiracy theories. People of color in the U.S. \"would be completely in sympathy with the Arab cause,\" Malcolm X said during a 1958 press conference covered by the New York Amsterdam News. \"The only point is they are not familiar with the true problems existing in the Middle East.\" Later, Malcolm X went to Gaza and visited Palestinian refugee camps months before his assassination in 1965.\n\nIt helped set the stage in the U.S. more than two years later for Black Power activists to take a divisive stance after the Arab-Israeli war in 1967 ended with Israel defeating Egypt, Jordan and Syria and capturing the West Bank of the Jordan River, Gaza and other territories. That marked the start of Israel's ongoing occupation of the West Bank and a major public rift among African American activists - many of whom supported the Zionist movement and the creation of the state of Israel as a homeland for Jews, including survivors of the Holocaust.\n\n\"We need to understand that Black identification with Zionism predates the formation of Israel as a modern state,\" says Robin D. G. Kelley, a historian at the University of California, Los Angeles who studies social movements. \"It goes back to the Book of Exodus in the Bible - the story of the flight of the Jews out of Egypt, which was not only a narrative of emancipation and renewal, but it was deployed by African Americans to critique American slavery and racism.\"\n\nMost Black leaders welcomed Israel's founding in 1948, Kelley adds: \"You look at the Black press. There was virtually no mention of Arab dispossession. Instead, they identified with European Jews as an oppressed and dispossessed people who survive near extermination.\"\n\nBut after the 1967 war, a different perspective was becoming more visible.\n\nDemonstrators wave the Palestinian flag and chant \"Black Lives Matter,\" among other slogans, during a march ahead of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in 2016. Adrees Latif/Reuters hide caption\n\nDemonstrators wave the Palestinian flag and chant \"Black Lives Matter,\" among other slogans, during a march ahead of the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in 2016.\n\n\"It was a real turning point,\" says Michael Fischbach, a Middle East historian at Randolph-Macon College and author of Black Power and Palestine: Transnational Countries of Color .\n\nThe book details a controversial article that was published, weeks after the conflict ended, in the newsletter of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, one of the most influential organizations in the civil rights movement.\n\nTitled, \"The Palestine Problem: Test Your Knowledge,\" the SNCC newsletter listicle of numbered bullet points described Israel as an \"illegal state\" and Palestinian refugees as \"victims of Zionist, British, and U.S. Aggression.\" It represented a reframing among Black Power activists of the Middle East conflict as part of a worldwide struggle against colonialism and imperialism.\n\n\"It became much easier not to see Israel as, you know, the brave little republic farming in the desert and instead see it in their view as a Western-sponsored interloper, a colonial settler state that had dispossessed a people of color,\" Fischbach says.\n\nThe 1967 SNCC article was criticized for its rhetoric and drawings that evoked antisemitic tropes, including a dollar sign inside the Star of David. The newsletter's editor insisted that image was supposed to symbolize the close relationship between the U.S. and Israel, an alliance that Black Power activists argued made the U.S. government a common enemy for African Americans and Palestinians.\n\n\"The present discourse that criticizing Israel or Zionism is somehow antisemitic really does, I believe, date from this time period,\" Fischbach says, \"because it caught so many people off guard in the strongly pro-Israeli community.\"\n\nA. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin were among the leaders of the civil rights movement to condemn and distance themselves from SNCC, saying in a joint statement they were \"appalled and distressed by the anti-Semitic article,\" The New York Times reported . They would later help start an organization, called Black Americans to Support Israel Committee, in part to counter statements against Israel, which had the backing of many Jews in the U.S. \"Jewish Americans supported us, marched with us and died for the cause of racial freedom,\" Randolph said during a press conference announcing BASIC in 1975. \"Black people cannot turn their backs on a friend.\"\n\nIn 1970, Randolph and Rustin organized a full-page ad to be placed in the Times and The Washington Post under the title \"An Appeal by Black Americans For United States Support to Israel.\" Calling out the views of \"a small minority of blacks,\" the ad questioned whether there is \"an inherent solidarity of nonwhite people,\" such as between Black Africans and \"nonwhite Arabs,\" and called for the U.S. government to provide Israel \"with the full number of jet aircraft it has requested.\"\n\nOther civil rights leaders - including John Lewis, Jackie Robinson, the NAACP's Roy Wilkins and the National Urban League's Whitney Young - signed on to say they \"support Israel's right to exist for the same reasons that we have struggled for freedom and equality in America\" and \"believe that only peace and economic development can bring real justice to the Arab people.\"\n\nAmong some Black activists during this period, however, frustration with the gradual gains of the civil rights movement was mounting. SNCC's public criticism of Israel in 1967 came during what's been called the \"long, hot summer\" of unrest in U.S. cities .\n\n\"This is a moment when Black identification with Zionism as a striving for land and self-determination gave way to a radical critique of Zionism,\" says Kelley, the UCLA historian who also serves on the advisory board of the U.S. Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel.\n\nNonetheless, in the decades since then, support for Israel has remained strong among many Black people. \"The number of African Americans in solidarity with Palestine still represented a minority,\" Kelley says. \"It was never the majority.\"\n\nIn recent years, organizers have been trying to rebuild momentum. Delegations of Black activists, including Kelley, have visited the West Bank to see how Palestinians are living. Kelley also appeared in a video released in 2015 by activist groups, such as the Dream Defenders, Black Youth Project 100 and the Institute for Middle East Understanding, to highlight Black-Palestinian solidarity.\n\n\"When I see them, I see us,\" the video's multiple narrators repeated, comparing the Palestinian struggle to the fight against police brutality in the U.S. It's a kind of comparison that's drawn pushback from some Jewish groups such as the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nA demonstrator holds a sign that reads \"Palestinians for Black Power\" during a protest in the streets of New York City in June 2020.

Black/Corbis via Getty Images hide caption\n\nA demonstrator holds a sign that reads \"Palestinians for Black Power\" during a protest in the streets of New York City in June 2020.\n\nStill, Kelley says social media helped forge a connection in 2014, when protests erupted in Ferguson, Mo., after police killed Michael Brown as war raged between Israel and Gaza , leaving more than 2,200 people dead, mostly Palestinian civilians.\n\n\"That connection really, in some ways, concretized a much stronger African American and Palestinian solidarity than I think we've seen even back in '67,\" Kelley adds.\n\nHow The Movement for Black Lives, the coalition of Black-led advocacy organizations, expressed that solidarity in 2016 set off another controversy. Its political platform called Israel \"an apartheid state\" and argued that by providing military aid to Israel, the U.S. is \"complicit in the genocide taking place against the Palestinian people.\"\n\n\"That type of rhetoric tends to ring the fight-or-flight bells of most but not all - but most Jewish Americans,\" says Jacques Berlinerblau, a Georgetown University professor of Jewish civilization. \"They'll either run away from the conversation because they find that type of oratory so over-the-top or so offensive, or they want to contest it.\"\n\nBerlinerblau, who co-authored an upcoming book called Blacks and Jews in America: An Invitation to Dialogue , says this kind of feedback loop has been on repeat since some Black activists started speaking out against Israel and for the Palestinians.\n\nStill, social media images and video of last month's war between Israel and Hamas brought many Black Lives Matter activists in the U.S. to the streets, including Nee Nee Taylor, who attended a rally last month outside Israel's embassy in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"Palestine's struggle is our struggle,\" said Taylor, who had organized with BLM's D.C. chapter before forming Harriet's Wildest Dreams, a group that's also part of the movement for Black lives. \"As long as we build power in collaboration and stand in solidarity with each other, I believe that all of us will get free.\"\n\nBethelehem Yirga, another demonstrator at the rally who co-founded a Black-led, D.C.-based activist organization called The Palm Collective, said the time many spent quarantining because of the coronavirus pandemic helped boost support for the Palestinians.\n\n\"That brought people time to really dig deep into what connects us,\" Yirga said. \"And through that, the great awakening is showcasing that oppression is oppression across the world and that we're uniting against it.\"\n\nIt's a conversation from the Palestinian perspective that Thomas, the organizer with Black Lives Matter in Paterson, N.J., says has often been missing in mainstream media, and now, after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis ignited an international outcry, more people are speaking up.\n\n\"This conversation is really giving space to say that, 'You know, I do not agree with what's going on,' \" Thomas says. \"And we created a space where now it's OK to criticize Israel. And more and more people are able to do that more freely than even two months ago.\"\n\nAnd the cease-fire between Israel and Hamas, Thomas adds, has not changed BLM's solidarity with Palestinians still living under occupation.\n\nNPR researcher Julia Wohl and producer Connor Donevan contributed to this report.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Activists charge that disparaging posts targeting BLM are part of an overall effort to undermine the movement and its message.

Support for Black Lives Matter surged after protests following George Floyd's death. Activists charge that disparaging posts targeting BLM are part of an overall effort to undermine the movement and its message.\n\nOn May 25, 2020, George Floyd died under the knee of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin and protests erupted worldwide. Support for Black Lives Matter - the movement that actually began as a hashtag in 2013 - surged. To this day, posts on social media continue to call for racial justice and an end to police brutality.\n\nBut also online are posts riddled with disinformation, including those specifically targeting BLM.  Activists charge that those disparaging posts are part of an overall effort to undermine the movement and its message.\n\nOne post, for example, falsely claims the government has identified it as a terrorist group. Another that circulated widely claimed that BLM activists had badly beaten a group of elderly white people. That post was debunked by fact checkers who found the photos were of South Africans and had been online for years. It was removed, however Jorden Giger, an organizer with Black Lives Matter in South Bend, Ind., says there's still plenty of disinformation online designed to create confusion and distrust.\n\n\"Like reports circulating that BLM is going to vandalize businesses in downtown areas, that we are targeting specific, you know, white communities, those kinds of things,\" he says. \" It makes our supporters say, 'OK, I don't want to get involved in that.' Right? So when those kinds of lies and when the disinformation just goes unchecked, you know, folks will believe it, if you don't get ahead of it or respond to it appropriately.\"\n\nGiger says that's why BLM launched an effort to stop disinformation and urges people to submit details about suspicious posts or stories to the Black Lives Matter website.\n\nWinBlack/Pa'lante, a nonpartisan group created after the 2016 presidential election, also monitors disinformation aimed at people of color . Hundreds of organizers across the country formed a digital war room during last year's election. They tracked bots that automatically send out scripted disinformation, often from Russia or other foreign governments trying to sow discord in the U.S. They tracked what are known as digital blackface accounts that steal images to masquerade as Black people and spread disinformation. Ashley Bryant, one of the co-leaders of WinBlack/Pa'lante, says they also found conspiracy theories about Black Lives Matter.\n\n\"That went from George Floyd not being dead to, you know, George Soros funding protests and the full out attacks on BLM where there's foreign actors, there's fake accounts pretending to be Antifa - all to actually just build this violent narrative around BLM,\" she says.\n\nDeen Freelon, a journalism professor at the University of North Carolina who studies digital politics, points to specific instances of disinformation about Black Lives Matter protesters engaging in violence.\n\n\"There was a false story about Black Lives Matter allied protesters setting fires in Oregon. So connecting to the wildfires there,\" he says. \"Also claims that Black Lives Matter is white-led and there has been some Spanish language disinformation.\"\n\nFreelon says Twitter has been vigilant about rooting out state-sponsored disinformation from foreign actors. Facebook says it's taken several steps, too, including working with nonpartisan and independent fact checkers to root out the spread of fake stories.\n\nInformation proven to be false can be removed for violating social media standards. That's not the case when it comes to posts online that are technically considered an opinion-- that's harder to combat.\n\n\"Examples there include things like the notion that BLM is anti white, which, of course, is an opinion, that it is a hate group,\" Freelon says. \"That it's somehow anti-family, that it is morally equivalent to far-right groups, and then there are some things that kind of blur the line between fact and opinion.\"\n\nCritics of Black Lives Matters, like Mike Gonzalez, a senior fellow at the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, says its the movement's supporters that are getting duped.\n\n\"I feel that Black Lives Matter is one of the greatest sources of disinformation,\" says Gonzalez, who is the author of an upcoming book on the organization and Marxism.\n\n\"They have good Americans, good Americans, well intentioned Americans who do not want to see racial injustice, and rightly so, putting up signs on their lawn about Black Lives Matter,\" he says.  \"They (BLM) have manipulated the good nature of many people who think what they're doing, in my view, is trying to promote a philosophy that is not going to be good for this country, will destroy this country and will destroy our way of life.\"\n\nAnd then right-wing pundits such as Rudy Giuliani, Candace Owens and Carol Swain amplify often baseless anti-BLM messages to wider audiences. On a Fox News talk show last July, Giuliani said, \"Black Lives Matter wants to come and take your house away from you. They want to take your property away from you.\"\n\nPatrisse Khan Cullors is one of the three co-founders of Black Lives Matter Movement. Valerie Macon/AFP via Getty Images hide caption\n\nPatrisse Khan Cullors is one of the three co-founders of Black Lives Matter Movement.\n\nOn a YouTube show the following day, Swain said, \"They (BLM) are using Black people to advance a Marxist agenda.\"\n\nDuring her Twitter video post, Candace Owens described BLM protesters as \"far left crazy Antifa thugs who know exactly what they're doing.\"\n\nPatrisse Khan-Cullors, one of the three co-founders of Black Lives Matter, responds to some of that on her YouTube channel .\n\n\"I need to set the record straight. Am I a Marxist?\" she asks. Khan-Cullors explains that she does believe in Marxism but laughs at online comments that say she's pushing a communist agenda.\n\n\"I am working on making sure that people don't suffer,\" she says. \"I am working to make sure that people don't go hungry and these comments I've received have been incredibly hurtful. It means that some people aren't taking the work of BLM seriously.\"\n\nTomiko Brown-Nagin, dean of the Radcliffe Institute at Harvard, says some of the disinformation surrounding Black Lives Matter could be from the old-style, anti-civil rights playbook of the 1960s. The FBI under J. Edgar Hoover and segregationists repeatedly used disinformation in an attempt to besmirch that movement.\n\n\"So opponents characterized activists as lawbreakers or as violent when overwhelmingly they were nonviolent,\" Brown-Nagin says. \"Also Martin Luther King Jr. and members of his inner circle were said to be communists or communist sympathizers.\"\n\nJust as the civil rights movement of past years, Black Lives Matter has seen its support both rise and decline after months of protest and the conviction of former police officer Derek Chauvin . While polls show a large majority of African Americans continue to back the movement - overall support has dropped from record levels seen after Floyd's death. How much of that loss is due to disinformation is difficult to measure but what's certain is the battle over controlling what people believe about Black Lives Matter and its influence is ongoing.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

The city created the mural amid mass protests after police murdered George Floyd.\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Crews here in Washington have started removing the Black Lives Matter street mural. The city created the painting back in 2020 just a few blocks from the White House amid a nationwide wave of protests after police murdered George Floyd. Sarah Y. Kim from member station WAMU reports. SARAH Y KIM, BYLINE: On Monday morning, a few residents and visitors stopped to say goodbye to Black Lives Matter Plaza, a two-block mural composed of large yellow letters. They watched construction workers remove bollards from the street. (SOUNDBITE OF TOOLS CLANKING) KIM: D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser named the plaza and commissioned the mural shortly after federal officers tear gassed people in Lafayette Square peacefully protesting police brutality. It was seen as an act of defiance against President Donald Trump, but now the mayor is overseeing its destruction. D.C. native Karen George says she's upset, but there isn't much Bowser can do. The city has to remove the mural or risk losing federal funds. KAREN GEORGE: It's a rock and a hard place for her. We're not a state. We're a district. KIM: Her sister, Adrianne Lind, says she thought the mural would be permanent, a symbol of her city and a tourist attraction like the Washington Monument. She says it's painful to see it go but that it won't be forgotten. ADRIANNE LIND: There's no such thing as erasure. If that's the attempt, it's just not possible to do because it's not just that we saw it, the whole world saw it. KIM: Lind and George say they'd like to see it preserved in a museum or recreated elsewhere in the city. Dr. Reed Tuckson, former health commissioner for the city, says this is an all too familiar situation, where outsiders exert power over the people of D.C. REED TUCKSON: Once again, we see the Congress treating this city as if we were not adults who could govern their own affairs. KIM: Under a bill introduced last week in Congress, the street is expected to be redesignated as Liberty Plaza. For NPR News, I'm Sarah Y. Kim in Washington.

She recalls that taking a knee to call attention to how law enforcement violence impacts black people lead to the end of Colin Kaepernick's career in the NFL.\n\n\"[Police officers] taking a knee is not stopping the deaths of our community members,\" she says. \"We need transformation. These things don't happen through police taking a knee at protests and then right after they take a knee, getting up and tear-gassing us and rubber bulleting us and beating us with batons.\"\n\nOn what would constitute justice for this moment\n\n\"For a lot of people, they want accountability for what these officers have done. Some people are asking for prosecuting law enforcement. I think that's a fine demand and that's not a demand rooted in us being able to change this system, it's holding an individual accountable for their actions. An individual that is tied to an institution that has caused a lot of destruction. I get that demand.\n\n\"But I do think that the demand of defunding law enforcement becomes a central demand ... And, with that demand, it's not just about taking away money from the police, it's about reinvesting those dollars into black communities. Communities that have been deeply divested from, communities that, some have never felt the impact of having true resources. And so we have to reconsider what we're resourcing. I've been saying we have an economy of punishment over an economy of care.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn the argument for restructuring police funding to help the communities they serve, rather than defunding law enforcement\n\n\"It's not possible for the entity of law enforcement to be a compassionate, caring governmental agency in black communities. That's not the training, that's not the institution. We have spent the last seven years asking for training, asking for body cameras. The body cameras have done nothing more than show us what's happened over and over again. The training has done nothing but show us that law enforcement and the culture of law enforcement is incapable of changing.\n\n\"And so what we're asking for is a reinvestment in how we understand what's needed in our communities. Why is law enforcement the first responders for a mental health crisis? Why are they the first responders for domestic violence issues? Why are they the first responders for homelessness? And so those are the first places we can look into. Let alone, let's talk about law enforcement's ability to surveil the community and how much money they're given in surveillance dollars every single year. We have allowed, the public has allowed, for us to have militarized police forces in our communities and we have to stop it.\"\n\nChris Bentley produced and edited this interview for broadcast with Kathleen McKenna . Allison Hagan adapted it for the web.\n\nThis segment aired on June 3, 2020.\n\nTonya Mosley was the LA-based co-host of Here & Now.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement"

The city created the mural during the mass protests after police murdered George Floyd.\n\nA MARTÍNEZ, HOST: The removal of Washington D.C.'s Black Lives Matter street mural is underway. The city created the mural in front of Lafayette Square in 2020 amid a nationwide wave of protests after police murdered George Floyd. Here's Sarah Y. Kim from member station WAMU. SARAH Y KIM, BYLINE: On Monday morning, a few residents and visitors stopped to say goodbye to Black Lives Matter Plaza, a two-block mural composed of large yellow letters. They watched construction workers remove bollards from the street. (SOUNDBITE OF TOOLS CLANKING) KIM: D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser named the plaza and commissioned the mural shortly after federal officers tear gassed people in Lafayette Square peacefully protesting police brutality. It was seen as an act of defiance against President Donald Trump, but now the mayor is overseeing its destruction. D.C. native Karen George (ph) says she's upset, but there isn't much Bowser can do. The city has to remove the mural or risk losing federal funds. KAREN GEORGE: It's a rock and a hard place for her. We're not a state. We're a district. KIM: Her sister, Adrianne Lind, says she thought the mural would be permanent, a symbol of her city and a tourist attraction like the Washington Monument. She says it's painful to see it go but that it won't be forgotten. ADRIANNE LIND: There's no such thing as erasure. If that's the attempt, it's just not possible to do because it's not just that we saw it, the whole world saw it. KIM: Lind and George say they'd like to see it preserved in a museum or recreated elsewhere in the city. Dr. Reed Tuckson, former health commissioner for the city, says this is an all too familiar situation, where outsiders exert power over the people of D.C. REED TUCKSON: Once again, we see the Congress treating this city as if we were not adults who could govern their own affairs. KIM: Under a bill introduced last week in Congress, the street is expected to be redesignated as Liberty Plaza. For NPR News, I'm Sarah Y. Kim in Washington.

      "text": "Trump: Painting 'Black Lives Matter' On 5th Avenue Would Be 'Symbol Of Hate'\n\nBy\n\nBarbara Sprunt\n\n,\n\nKelsey Snell\n\n\"Black Lives Matter\" has already been added to Fulton Street in Brooklyn. Manhattan may be next up in New York City, but President Trump has denounced a plan to have the words painted on Fifth Avenue. John Minchillo/AP hide caption\n\n\"Black Lives Matter\" has already been added to Fulton Street in Brooklyn. Manhattan may be next up in New York City, but President Trump has denounced a plan to have the words painted on Fifth Avenue.\n\nUpdated at 5:18 p.m. ET\n\nPresident Trump rebuked New York City's plan to paint \"Black Lives Matter\" on Fifth Avenue, calling it a \"symbol of hate\" in a Wednesday morning tweet .\n\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio spoke about the plan in an interview Wednesday with MSNBC, saying he intends to have the words painted on the street where Trump Tower sits.\n\nTrump said doing so would amount to \"denigrating this luxury Avenue\" and would \"further antagonize\" police.\n\n....horrible BLM chant, \"Pigs In A Blanket, Fry 'Em Like Bacon\". Maybe our GREAT Police, who have been neutralized and scorned by a mayor who hates & disrespects them, won't let this symbol of hate be affixed to New York's greatest street. Spend this money fighting crime instead!\n\nOn MSNBC, de Blasio also announced changes to the city's police department.\n\n\"We're taking a billion dollars out of the NYPD. We're reducing the size of the NYPD, we're reducing overtime, we're moving some of the functions NYPD does now - they will be replaced by civilians handling those functions who can do them better. And we're going to take that money and put it into youth initiatives,\" he said.\n\nAs for painting \"Black Lives Matter\" on the famous street - an action that has sprung up elsewhere amid nationwide protests, including near the White House - de Blasio said he intends to send a message to Trump.\n\n\"It's an important message to the whole nation, and obviously we want the president to hear it because he's never shown respect for those three words. When he hears 'Black Lives Matter,' he presents a horrible, negative reality of something that doesn't exist, and he misses the underlying meaning that we're saying we have to honor the role of African Americans in our history and in our society,\" he said. \"We have to make it come alive today so we're going to make it really clear to the president, it's going to be right outside his doorstep.\"\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters during a briefing on Wednesday that the president was referring to the organization \"Black Lives Matter\" when he called it a symbol of hate.\n\n\"All black lives do matter, he agrees with that sentiment, but what he doesn't agree with is an organization that chants 'pigs in a blanket, fry 'em like bacon' about our police officers, our valiant heroes that are out on the street protecting us each and every day,\" she said.\n\nLate Tuesday night, Trump threatened to veto a must-pass defense bill over an amendment to rename military bases named after Confederate generals.\n\nThe bipartisan amendment was approved last month in the Senate Armed Services Committee and is part of legislation that also includes a pay raise for troops and improvements to military housing.\n\nThe annual defense bill typically passes with broad bipartisan support, and it's possible it could be approved later this month by the Senate with a veto-proof majority. The House version is expected to include a similar provision.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., dared Trump to make the threat hours before the president tweeted.\n\n\"I dare President Trump to veto the bill over Confederate-base naming,\" Schumer said at a press conference. \"I think the bottom line is what's in the bill will stay in the bill.\"\n\nTrump has recently defended the existence of Confederate monuments and statues as demonstrators across the country have taken to the streets to protest white supremacy and police brutality following the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other Black Americans at the hands of police.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump retweeted a video , apparently taken at The Villages retirement community in Florida, in which a man who appears to be a Trump supporter shouts \"white power\" to a group of protesters.\n\nTrump deleted the tweet a few hours later.\n\nWhite House deputy press secretary Judd Deere did not condemn the racist term in the tweet but instead said, \"President Trump is a big fan of The Villages. He did not hear the one statement made on the video. What he did see was tremendous enthusiasm from his many supporters.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "Black Lives Matter is marking its 10th anniversary this week\n\nNPR's A Martinez speaks with the group's co-founder Ayo Tometi about the movement's history and future.\n\nA MARTÍNEZ, HOST: Black Lives Matter is marking its 10th anniversary this week. The movement began in the wake of the acquittal of the shooter who killed Trayvon Martin, an unarmed Black teenager. The police killings of Michael Brown and George Floyd, among others, put BLM at the center of the push for criminal justice reform. Joining us now is Black Lives Matter co-founder Aya Tometi. Now, Aya, if you can take us back 10 years, when the movement first began, what was its mission? What did it set out to do? AYO TOMETI: Its mission was really to ensure that the voices and concerns of Black people were being heard. We were tired of the countless numbers of people that were being killed - if it was vigilantes, if it was law enforcement, if it was security guards. We were just sick and tired of hearing these stories in our communities. We were sad. We were devastated. And we knew that we had to take the tradition of community organizing that leaders like Martin Luther King and Malcolm X and many others have taught us, and we needed to remind the larger public that we actually have something that we can do when we're faced with these types of challenges, that we can organize, that we can harness the voices, the concerns, the work of our community, and we could step out in courage and do something to change it. MARTÍNEZ: How heard has it been? TOMETI: You know what? It's been a very difficult journey. I won't lie. You know, it's been an uphill battle to ensure that our voices were heard. We took to social media back in 2013 because we weren't being heard by traditional media, to be quite frank. We weren't hearing our stories. We weren't seeing the media cover it, and we knew that we had to use the tools of our time to ensure that our concerns were being, you know, heard. And we were sharing those stories amongst ourselves, and, you know, we saw the rise in our voices. We saw that people were concerned, and then we saw that, you know, media began to pay attention to our stories. And I think that was very important because we saw it pivot, if you will, where our voices were finally being amplified and taken more seriously. And over the years, we've seen many more people join us. Millions and millions of people have joined around the world to declare that Black lives do matter and that we want a different kind of world. We want a world where we have multiracial democracies that work for all of us, and it's very heartening to see that this movement is actually, in fact, very multiracial. It's very multifaceted. And it's not just about criminal justice or criminal justice reform, but it's about the quality of life that Black people should have in every sphere of life. So if it's the health care industry, if it's our workplace... MARTÍNEZ: Yeah. TOMETI: ...If it's the education, everywhere, we're seeing that people are understanding that this is about Black lives, period, no matter what because racism is embedded in every facet of our society. And so we require that we have transformation and... MARTÍNEZ: Yeah. TOMETI: ...Changes in every facet of our society. MARTÍNEZ: In 2021, you said that the Biden administration has a lot of work to do and has a long way to go on issues important to Black Lives Matter. How does the Biden administration look to you today? TOMETI: You know what? The Biden administration still has a long way to go. But the truth is that we are seeing that even just, you know, a little over a week ago, we saw the Supreme Court overturned affirmative action. We saw this pushback against the gay community, the queer community, LGBTQ folks. We've seen so many different setbacks. We've seen laws and proposals to criminalize activism in the wake of the 2020 uprisings against the murder of George Floyd and so on, and so we know that there's a lot of work to do across all aspects of our government. MARTÍNEZ: Ayo Tometi is a human rights advocate, one of the founders of Black Lives Matter. Thank you very much. TOMETI: Thank you. Copyright © 2023 NPR.  All rights reserved.

We were just sick and tired of hearing these stories in our communities. We were sad. We were devastated. And we knew that we had to take the tradition of community organizing that leaders like Martin Luther King and Malcolm X and many others have taught us, and we needed to remind the larger public that we actually have something that we can do when we're faced with these types of challenges, that we can organize, that we can harness the voices, the concerns, the work of our community, and we could step out in courage and do something to change it. MARTÍNEZ: How heard has it been? TOMETI: You know what? It's been a very difficult journey. I won't lie. You know, it's been an uphill battle to ensure that our voices were heard. We took to social media back in 2013 because we weren't being heard by traditional media, to be quite frank. We weren't hearing our stories. We weren't seeing the media cover it, and we knew that we had to use the tools of our time to ensure that our concerns were being, you know, heard. And we were sharing those stories amongst ourselves, and, you know, we saw the rise in our voices. We saw that people were concerned, and then we saw that, you know, media began to pay attention to our stories. And I think that was very important because we saw it pivot, if you will, where our voices were finally being amplified and taken more seriously. And over the years, we've seen many more people join us. Millions and millions of people have joined around the world to declare that Black lives do matter and that we want a different kind of world. We want a world where we have multiracial democracies that work for all of us, and it's very heartening to see that this movement is actually, in fact, very multiracial. It's very multifaceted. And it's not just about criminal justice or criminal justice reform, but it's about the quality of life that Black people should have in every sphere of life. So if it's the health care industry, if it's our workplace... MARTÍNEZ: Yeah. TOMETI: ...If it's the education, everywhere, we're seeing that people are understanding that this is about Black lives, period, no matter what because racism is embedded in every facet of our society. And so we require that we have transformation and... MARTÍNEZ: Yeah. TOMETI: ...Changes in every facet of our society. MARTÍNEZ: In 2021, you said that the Biden administration has a lot of work to do and has a long way to go on issues important to Black Lives Matter. How does the Biden administration look to you today? TOMETI: You know what? The Biden administration still has a long way to go. But the truth is that we are seeing that even just, you know, a little over a week ago, we saw the Supreme Court overturned affirmative action. We saw this pushback against the gay community, the queer community, LGBTQ folks. We've seen so many different setbacks. We've seen laws and proposals to criminalize activism in the wake of the 2020 uprisings against the murder of George Floyd and so on, and so we know that there's a lot of work to do across all aspects of our government.

Millions and millions of people have joined around the world to declare that Black lives do matter and that we want a different kind of world. We want a world where we have multiracial democracies that work for all of us, and it's very heartening to see that this movement is actually, in fact, very multiracial. It's very multifaceted. And it's not just about criminal justice or criminal justice reform, but it's about the quality of life that Black people should have in every sphere of life. So if it's the health care industry, if it's our workplace... MARTÍNEZ: Yeah. TOMETI: ...If it's the education, everywhere, we're seeing that people are understanding that this is about Black lives, period, no matter what because racism is embedded in every facet of our society. And so we require that we have transformation and... MARTÍNEZ: Yeah. TOMETI: ...Changes in every facet of our society. MARTÍNEZ: In 2021, you said that the Biden administration has a lot of work to do and has a long way to go on issues important to Black Lives Matter. How does the Biden administration look to you today? TOMETI: You know what? The Biden administration still has a long way to go. But the truth is that we are seeing that even just, you know, a little over a week ago, we saw the Supreme Court overturned affirmative action. We saw this pushback against the gay community, the queer community, LGBTQ folks. We've seen so many different setbacks. We've seen laws and proposals to criminalize activism in the wake of the 2020 uprisings against the murder of George Floyd and so on, and so we know that there's a lot of work to do across all aspects of our government.

      "text": "ProPublica logo\n\nSeries: Coronavirus\n\nBlack lives are being lost to COVID-19 at twice the rate of others. For protesters we talked to, that's one more reason to be on the street. \"If it's not police beating us up, it's us dying in a hospital from the pandemic,\" one said.\n\nby Akilah Johnson\n\nThe U.S. Response to COVID-19\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nWASHINGTON - On Tuesday, when he decided to protest, William Smith, 27, used a red marker to write a message on the back of a flattened cardboard box: \"Kill Racism, Not Me.\"\n\nAs he stood alone, somber, he thought about George Floyd, a fellow black man whom he'd watched die on video as a Minneapolis cop kneeled on his neck eight days earlier. \"Seeing the life leave his body was finally the last straw that broke the camel's back for me,\" he said.\n\nBut he also thought about people he knew, a handful of them, who died after catching the new coronavirus. \"They were living in impoverished areas. Couldn't get proper treatment. Lived in crowded conditions, so social distancing was hard to do. And they were still forced to go to work and be put in harm's way.\"\n\nAre you a public health worker or front-line medical provider? Do you work for or with a government agency involved in the effort to protect the public? Have you or your family personally been affected? Show us what we should be covering or serve as an expert to make sure we're on track.\n\nNote: If you develop emergency warning signs for COVID-19, such as difficulty breathing or bluish lips, get medical attention immediately. The CDC has more information on what to do if you are sick.\n\nWhen speaking out against the loss of black lives, it is tough to separate those who die at the hands of police from those who die in a pandemic that has laid bare the structural racism baked into the American health system. Floyd himself had tested positive for the coronavirus. Eighteen black protesters interviewed by ProPublica were well aware that black lives were being lost to the virus at more than twice the rate of others, and that societal barriers have compounded for generations to put them at higher risk.\n\nIt was fueling their desire to protest and their anxiety about joining the crowd. But they flocked to the White House on Tuesday afternoon, one day after peaceful protesters there were tear-gassed so that President Donald Trump could hold up a bible for a photo op at St. John's Episcopal Church. There were tanks on the streets, along with a battalion of federal agents, military troops and police. Many of the protesters said they were willing to sacrifice their bodies, either to violence or the virus, to be heard.\n\nIn front of the White House stood Caleb Jordan, who turns 21 on Saturday. He showed up with an overstuffed backpack to make sure his 62-year-old grandmother, Carolyn Jackson, had enough water to drink and a hoodie to protect her arms in case of violence. \"I don't know what I would do if anything happened to her,\" he said. Some people had on masks. Some did not. Some pulled their masks down to talk or breathe. \"I'm not comfortable with that,\" he said. She's got a chronic lung condition, and he had been so worried about her catching the coronavirus in the past few months that he wouldn't hug her. But then she mentioned that she drove by the protests on Sunday, and immediately he asked, \"Why didn't you take me?\"\n\nHe had been losing sleep over what he was seeing in social media and on TV, having nightmares in which he was fighting a \"real-Jim-Crow-looking white guy in a white button-down shirt, black tie, sleeves rolled up.\" His mom told him he was fighting racism. \"It's like obstacle after obstacle,\" he said. \"If it's not police beating us up, it's us dying in a hospital from the pandemic. I'm tired of being tired. I'm so tired, I can't sleep.\" It was something he continued thinking about until he couldn't help himself, sending a text at 3 a.m. asking his grandmother if they could attend together. \"I thought about it and said, 'This is a teachable moment,' \" she recalled.\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nSo Jackson took the day off from her job as an accountant at a hospice organization and put on some peace sign earrings and a T-shirt from the 20th anniversary of the Million Man March. On the car ride into the city, her grandson asked about her struggles with race. She explained what it's like being a professional black woman with over 30 years experience who still feels overlooked for opportunities because of questions about her qualifications. Her awareness of being treated differently dates back to how her white paternal grandmother favored her lighter-skinned cousins. She found solace in her black maternal grandmother, who would comb her hair while she sat between her legs. Jackson wants her grandson to feel that kind of comfort from her.\n\nThat desire extends to her mission to help the black community understand palliative care is an option that can offer dignity and support at the end of life. \"Because when people hear hospice, their hands go up and they say, 'I don't want to hear it.'\" She's also heard that resistance when it comes to getting tested for the coronavirus; she has gotten tested twice and plans to get tested again. She feared being exposed on Tuesday, but being here with her grandson was too important to miss. \"We internalized a lot with my generation,\" she said, \"but I think it's important for him to see this.\"\n\nN.W.A.'s \"Fuck Tha Police\" blared from a nearby speaker outside St. John's Episcopal Church until an interfaith group of men and women bowed their heads and began to pray. Among them was Timothy Freeman, pastor at Trinity African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church, who wore a brightly colored kente cloth-inspired mask, its vibrant yellows and reds standing in stark contrast to his ministerial black suit and white clerical collar.\n\nFreeman, 42, knows eight people who have been diagnosed with the virus; one died. For two weeks, a sick friend had a fever and could barely move from fatigue but refused to get tested, running through all the scenarios of what might happen if he had it: What if he wound up isolated in an ICU with no one to advocate at his bedside? Another sick friend worried an ambulance would take him to a hospital that he didn't trust. These conversations, the pastor said, are always infused with an awareness of the medical system's record of neglect and abuse of black people, from dismissing their pain to using their bodies for research without consent. The virus has forced this all top of mind.\n\nA licensed occupational therapist for 19 years who spent a decade managing a skilled rehab facility, Freeman said he has seen racial disparities in health care firsthand and that access to adequate insurance coverage is crucial. \"I have seen diagnostic tests not performed ... and hospitalizations cut extremely short - or not happen at all - because of insurance.\" COVID-19 is affecting black and brown people in disproportionate numbers, \"and not just because we're black and brown, but because of the social and economic conditions people are forced to live in,\" he said.\n\n\"All of it comes together. What happened with George Floyd publicized to the world the experience that we live,\" he said. \"It's a conglomeration of everything.\"\n\nA block away from the prayer group, Elizabeth Tsehai, 53, drove slowly in her BMW SUV, honking her horn, as federal agents in riot gear began to march past the crowd just behind her. She had a Black Lives Matter T-shirt displayed on the dashboard and a bike rack on the top of her car that she joked made her look like the \"caricature of a soccer mom.\"\n\nShe stopped her car on the road and remained there as protesters to her left took a knee. There was some heckling from the crowd but no one was in anybody's face. A Secret Service agent warned her to move. Her response: \"Arrest me. I can't breathe!\" Agents then pulled her from her car and to the ground and handcuffed her. \"I didn't resist because I know they just arrest you for resisting arrest,\" she said. \"But the minute they pulled me up on my feet, I was talking all kinds of trash.\"\n\nElizabeth Tsehai was stopped in her car, honking in support of protesters, when Secret Service agents pulled her out and handcuffed her.\n\nHer car was left unlocked in the middle of the street, where it was protected by protesters. She was questioned and released. She said agents told her they were afraid she was going to hit protesters because people have been using their cars as weapons. They told her to move it and leave. The Secret Service did not respond to questions about this incident.\n\n\"Ordinarily, I would not get involved,\" Tsehai said. But George Floyd's death was enraging, as were \"all of the things that came before it.\"\n\nAll of the things.\n\nHow a white nurse looked her up and down when she arrived at the hospital to give birth to her son and sneered, \"Can we help you?\"\n\nHow her brothers, who live in Minneapolis, recount being pulled over by police for driving while black.\n\nHow a black man couldn't watch birds in Central Park last week without having the police called on him.\n\n\"The pandemic is hitting black people hard and exposing these structural inequalities,\" she said. \"Then on top of that, you get Amy Cooper ... weaponizing her white privilege at a time when he might end up in jail, where infection is rife.\n\n\"But when they manhandled protesters who were peaceful, that was a bridge too far,\" said Tsehai, who grew up in Ethiopia under an authoritarian regime during a period known as Red Terror. She didn't know life without a curfew until she moved to the United States to attend Georgetown University 35 years ago.\n\nMedicare's COVID-19 testing costs reached over $2 billion in 2022. The growing costs concern some experts, who say financial incentives and a lack of regulation early in the pandemic led to fraud and overspending.\n\n\"Moments like this are quite unusual,\" she said. They can also inspire change, a message she shared with her children, ages 12 and 14, when recounting her ordeal with them. \"I want these children to live in a different world. It's not enough to read about it and get outraged and talk about it at the dinner table. Silence makes you complicit.\"\n\nAre you a public health worker or front-line medical provider?

Some say Anna's first Black Lives Matter protest is a step toward real change. But what is next?\n\nby Logan Jaffe\n\nDive Deeper Into Our Reporting\n\nThe image on Facebook showed three raised fists - one white, one brown, one black - with the hashtag BLM overlaid in large letters. A date and place to meet was at the bottom: Thursday, June 4. The location: Anna, Illinois.\n\nA Black Lives Matter protest. In Anna?\n\nIn November, I'd published a story about this small southern Illinois city's reputation as a sundown town - a place where black people were not welcome after dark - and the legend about what Anna stands for: \"Ain't No N--- Allowed.\" The article stirred up strong feelings in the town, where all public officials, police officers and nearly all teachers are white. While many current and former residents wrote to me to share their own stories about racism in the area, others decried the story as perpetuating the A-N-N-A reputation.\n\nA Black Lives Matter protest in Anna. Who was behind it? How many people would join? What would the reaction be?\n\nAnd what would this mean for A-N-N-A?\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\n\"I was terrified to do this. I'm not going to lie,\" said Jessica Moore, 25, one of the organizers.\n\nShe added, \"I've experienced racism in Anna my entire life.\"\n\nMoore, who is biracial, grew up in Ullin, a small town about 20 minutes south of Anna. Her earliest memory of being a victim of racism in Anna happened when she was 8, she told me. As she was leaving the Anna Walmart with her mother, who is white, Moore said she remembers a woman screaming at her after she accidentally pushed a shopping cart into her car, repeatedly calling Moore the N-word. When she got older and started going to bars and restaurants in Anna, she said people would call her the N-word, too.\n\nMoore is one of a small group of young people in southern Illinois leading the region's recent demonstrations against police brutality and in support of black lives, many in towns with histories like Anna's. Most of the organizers did not know one another a month ago. And many, like Moore, are new to the cause.\n\nAfter she took part in her first protest in Paducah, Kentucky, on May 31, Moore said leaders there encouraged her to organize in her own community and gave her some tips. A few days later, a lightbulb went off: \"It's time to show Anna,\" she thought.\n\nAnna resident Takiyah Coleman, 19, agreed. The two, along with several other young adults from the area, met with Anna Police Chief Bryan Watkins to explain their plan to protest. Watkins said he told them he wanted to ensure they felt safe coming to town to do so, but to also expect some opposition from residents.\n\n\"We've never had a demonstration in town like this,\" Watkins, who said he's lived in Anna for 45 years, later told me. (He prefers to use the word \"demonstrate\" instead of \"protest,\" he said, because \"people associate protest with rioting.\")\n\nWhen Watkins informed residents through his personal Facebook page about the event, the post prompted more than 350 shares and 600 comments, which ranged from curiosity to praise to fear.\n\n\"I hope everyone is ready to protect their business with brute force!\" wrote one commenter from the area.\n\n\"How long do these things typically last??\" wrote another.\n\nThe comments reminded me of stories people in Anna have told me about rumors spreading through town in the late 1960s and early 1970s that black people from Cairo, about 30 minutes south, were coming up to Anna to riot. That never happened, but some residents remember waiting with guns in case it did.\n\nAnna City Council member Bryan Miller said he got received calls from residents concerned about the Black Lives Matter protest. He and I have been talking since November, when he commented on a Facebook post about my story, saying: \"Uhm, I'm guessing [A-N-N-A] doesn't go away because you keep writing about an issue that is long gone.\"\n\nI've appreciated our frank discussions about the story and about his community. A new City Council member, Miller said he is determined to erase the A-N-N-A stigma. When residents called him with concerns about the protest, he said that he told them it was a chance to change Anna's reputation, and that, \"I expect you to do your part.\"\n\nThe day of the protest, a post on the official Facebook page for Anna expressed a similar sentiment: \"In recent months, citizens were outraged over an article written about Anna. Well, actions speak louder than words. Tonight is our chance to show the world what we are made of.\"\n\nMoore, one of the organizers, said she expected about 60 people to show up. She was wrong.\n\nNearly 200 people marched through Anna's streets. Many of them were young and white and described themselves as being from southern Illinois. Other area residents gathered along the route to watch an event many thought they'd never see.\n\nAlexis Steward, 21, who grew up in Anna and helped organize the march, said she spent much of it bawling. The tears started when she began to realize how many people had shown up. She remembered when she was bullied at Anna junior high. She said she wants Anna to be a place where she feels she could start a family, and where she wouldn't have to worry about her children feeling the pain she felt growing up there.\n\n\"I've always been shy,\" Steward said. \"Not anymore.\"\n\n\"We need more people who are educated, loud and who can stand for people who cannot.\"\n\nWhen she marched past some Anna residents she recognized, who she said were screaming at the protesters to \"get out of their town,\" she said she knew she was doing something right.\n\nSo, too, did Aveon Winfield, another organizer, who grew up in nearby Grand Chain. When he heard onlookers repeatedly use the N-word, Winfield, 21, said he kept his eyes fixed on the ground and marched on. Winfield's mother has worked for years at a mental health center in Anna. He thought about her, a woman of color, spending her days in a town where some residents still used racial slurs.\n\nMost people I met in Anna, Illinois, wish the racist lore behind the city's name would go away. So, why hasn't it?\n\nColeman said she wanted the protest to show other residents that \"change starts here.\" Coleman and her family moved to Anna from Chicago three years ago, she said. She knew what Anna stood for but said she didn't think much of it until a white customer at the local McDonald's, where she worked, refused to let her pour his coffee.\n\nAmong the marchers, too, was Easter Smith.\n\nI first met Easter in 2018, after a number of Anna residents suggested I speak with her. At the time, Smith and her six children were one of the few black families living in Anna. Her eldest son, Arieh, had won the Illinois state wrestling championship for his weight class. He was elected homecoming king of Anna-Jonesboro Community High School. I wrote about how the family challenged many white residents' assumptions about black people while quietly struggling to balance their very public status in the community with the private pain of the racism they experienced.\n\nEaster said she has lost some friends in Anna and become more outspoken about her experience there since the story was published. Last week, her family moved about 20 minutes away, to Murphysboro. She said she would have liked to stay in Anna until her children finished school there, but she had trouble finding a comfortable home to rent. She decided to march before she left, she said, because she felt she \"needed to see it.\"\n\n\"How are we going to be one of the first black families and not go to the protest?\" Easter said.\n\nEarly on during the protest, a speaker, who was white, reminded the crowd of the signs posted around the city limits in Arieh's honor, a positive contrast to signs long rumored to have once warned black people to be out of town before dark.\n\nTwo thoughts struck Easter. The first, she said, was that, as a black person in America, \"Normally when your name is called in public, it's because it's in memorial.\" The second: It \"doesn't take away racism because a black kid holds a title at your school.\"\n\nThe protest ended peacefully. Police made no arrests. No property was damaged.\n\nThe protest was covered across the region and the focus of a Reuters story about small-town Black Lives Matter protests, which was republished by national news outlets.\n\nThe headline of a story in the Southern Illinoisan referenced a chant repeated at the protest: \" Ain't No Negativity Allowed ,\" a new, positive twist on A-N-N-A.\n\nMiller, the City Council member, said he's thinking about making yard signs for residents with the slogan. Everybody is welcome in Anna, he said.\n\nI asked him what he thinks can be done to show that beyond the protest.\n\n\"It's our responsibility to change everything that is going on around here,\" Miller said. \"If people were more just willing to talk to other people, things would change so much quicker.\"\n\nI asked some of the organizers, too, whether Anna still deserves A-N-N-A.\n\nMoore didn't think so, though she said, \"There are people in Anna that still give Anna the name it has.\"\n\nBut Coleman disagreed. The town is still A-N-N-A, she said.\n\n\"The people in the town have to change in order for that to change. They have to make it mean something else,\" Coleman said. \"They have to not be racist.\"\n\nBut, she added: \"Change starts somewhere, and if a group of teenagers have to be the ones to do it, so be it.\"\n\n---\n\nPS: Help us learn more about you and how you think we're doing - and enter to win a ProPublica tote bag - by taking our annual reader survey .\n\nFiled under:\n\nLogan Jaffe\n\nLogan Jaffe is a reporter for newsletters at ProPublica.\n\nGet our investigations delivered to your inbox with the Big Story newsletter.\n\nCreative Commons License (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)\n\nThank you for your interest in republishing this story.

      "text": "Only Two NYPD Officers Face Serious Discipline From a Watchdog's Investigations Into Abuse of Black Lives Matter Protesters\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nNine months after racial justice protests swept across New York City and videos showed police punching, kicking and trapping demonstrators, the city agency responsible for investigating abuses has revealed the number of officers who have so far faced serious disciplinary charges.\n\nTwo.\n\nThe Civilian Complaint Review Board released the figures on Tuesday after ProPublica reported that the CCRB was declining to disclose how much progress it had made on protest cases. The new numbers show about 60% of the agency's 297 protest-related cases are still open.\n\nCCRB investigations can take a long time, about eight months on average. Its investigations into the summer protests have been slowed in particular by a lack of NYPD cooperation, as ProPublica detailed last week, and agency staffers have been discouraged from confronting the NYPD. After our reporting prompted pointed criticism from a City Council member and others, CCRB officials promised at a public board meeting last week to release figures as soon as possible.\n\nSo far, the agency has only been able to fully investigate 37 cases. About 75 cases were closed before a full investigation could be completed. Sometimes civilians did not follow up or decided to withdraw their complaints to pursue lawsuits.\n\nThe relatively few completed investigations have resulted in 14 complaints being substantiated so far. In 12 cases, the CCRB has recommended relatively minor punishment, which is to be decided by the officers' commanders. In the other two, the CCRB has moved for departmental disciplinary trials.\n\nThe CCRB said in an emailed statement on Wednesday that one of the two cases involved an officer who appeared to flash a white power sign , and the other concerned an officer who allegedly hit a protester with a baton.\n\nThe chair of the CCRB, Rev. Frederick Davie, also acknowledged at a City Council hearing on Tuesday that investigators have faced a challenge \"around access to information from the Police Department.\"\n\nAs ProPublica's story last week noted, CCRB staffers emailed superiors that the NYPD repeatedly said it had no body-worn camera footage of an incident, only to have investigators later discover that there was, in fact, footage. In response to questions, the NYPD said in a statement last week, \"We have spoken with senior executives at the CCRB who state they do not have any complaints\" about footage.\n\nThe CCRB's statement Wednesday also said investigators have had difficulty identifying officers \"due to the Police Department not keeping track of where officers were deployed and due to officers wearing protective gear with incorrect shield numbers.\"\n\nRead More\n\nThe release of information about the protest cases comes as the city and the NYPD face increasing pressure to change the discipline process for officers. On Tuesday, state legislators introduced a bill to strip the NYPD commissioner of final authority over discipline. The move follows a New York City Council resolution in January calling for the legislature to act.\n\nAs ProPublica has detailed , commissioners have often used their discretion to overturn not only the CCRB's recommendations for punishments but also rulings by NYPD hearing officers and even guilty pleas agreed to by police officers.\n\nAllegations of misconduct by officers can also be investigated by the NYPD's Internal Affairs Bureau, and the department has said that investigations of some protest encounters have been referred for disciplinary action. The department did not respond to a request this week for comment about the status of any discipline stemming from protest cases.\n\nMollie Simon contributed reporting.\n\nFiled under -\n\nEric Umansky is an editor-at-large at ProPublica.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "Over 700 Complaints About NYPD Officers Abusing Black Lives Matter Protesters, Then Silence\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nThis story was co-published with THE CITY .\n\nIt was one of the most brutal police responses to last year's Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nAs hundreds of demonstrators were marching peacefully in the Bronx on the evening of June 4, New York Police Department officers blocked their way from in front and then behind, trapping the protesters in an ever-tightening space that footage shows ultimately spanned about three car-lengths.\n\nOfficers soon waded into the crowd, pepper-spraying, kicking, punching and swinging their batons. \"People were being stampeded, they would try to get up and they'd get hit again,\" recalled Conrad Blackburn, a criminal defense lawyer who was there as a legal observer. \"People were bleeding from their heads, with cuts all over their bodies. People couldn't breathe. They couldn't see.\"\n\nAbout 60 protesters and bystanders were injured, according to a report by Human Rights Watch. Video footage the organization compiled captures the terror in people's voices. \"We're being crushed!\" one person screams. Another voice pleads, \"Mommy!\"\n\nAt the demonstration, overseeing the NYPD's response, was the top uniformed officer, Chief of Department Terence Monahan.\n\nA recent federal lawsuit by New York State Attorney General Letitia James says that Monahan \"actively encouraged and participated in this unlawful behavior.\" Other reports on the protests have also offered scathing criticisms of the NYPD's response.\n\nBut one voice has been conspicuously quiet: The agency whose sole responsibility is to investigate NYPD abuse of civilians.\n\nThe New York City Civilian Complaint Review Board, or CCRB, received about 750 complaints of officers abusing Black Lives Matter protesters across the city last year. But it has not yet released any findings from investigations into those complaints.\n\nThe CCRB declined ProPublica's request for an accounting of the status of its investigations. It won't say how many investigations have been closed and how many are still open. Most critically, it won't disclose how many officers have been charged with misconduct.\n\nThe NYPD also did not respond to ProPublica's questions about any discipline stemming from abuse of protesters.\n\nThe lack of disclosure comes as New York City has moved toward more transparency in police discipline. A federal court recently cleared the way for the city to make NYPD officers' disciplinary records public. Both the CCRB and NYPD have now published officers' disciplinary records, though critics have noted the limitations of the databases.\n\nCreated nearly 70 years ago, originally as a part of the NYPD, the CCRB has long been cautious about crossing the department it is charged with investigating. It is currently overseen by a 15-member board, with members appointed by the mayor, city council, public advocate and police commissioner.\n\nInternal CCRB communications about its investigations into the NYPD response to the protests give a glimpse of the dynamics involved: They show progress on the investigations has been slowed in part because of the NYPD's recurrent lack of cooperation - which ProPublica has previously detailed - and the CCRB leadership's own caution about confronting it.\n\nIn October, the then-deputy chief of the CCRB's investigative unit, Dane Buchanan, emailed the agency's executive director, Jonathan Darche, to say that investigators were \"ready to schedule Chief Monahan for an interview.\" Buchanan asked Darche whether he'd like to discuss it first \"or should we just have an investigator reach out to his office to get his availability?\"\n\nDarche, who reports to the board, responded that he would handle it himself and raise it in a meeting with the NYPD the next day.\n\nBuchanan continued to check in, but the issue went unresolved for months. Monahan was reportedly finally scheduled for an interview to be conducted last Friday, just after he had announced he was retiring from the NYPD after 39 years. The move means Monahan would no longer be subject to departmental discipline.\n\nAs Monahan said he was retiring, Mayor Bill de Blasio appointed him to help run New York's COVID-19 response. At a press conference, de Blasio deflected a question about choosing an officer under investigation, saying , \"I think the message this sends is that we're moving the recovery forward.\"\n\nIn a statement, the CCRB told ProPublica it was \"not prepared to interview Chief Monahan in October\" and that \"it intends to release a report detailing the factors that complicated its investigations into the police response to last summer's protests.\" The CCRB said it will share the results of investigations once they are closed and once federal litigation, such as the attorney general's suit, is over.\n\nEmails show CCRB staffers had repeatedly raised red flags about the NYPD's failure to produce evidence. \"We continue to be plagued with false negatives in protest cases,\" one staffer emailed in the fall, referring to instances where the NYPD claimed it had no body-worn camera footage of an incident only for the CCRB to later discover footage exists.\n\nAnother email cited an example where an officer mentioned in an interview she had activated her body cam during a confrontation with a protester. The NYPD had told the CCRB that no such footage existed.\n\n\"Allegations of us not providing BWC footage is false,\" the NYPD said in a statement, referring to body-worn cameras. \"We have spoken with senior executives at the CCRB who state they do not have any complaints and are pleased with the Departments response to providing BWC video.\"\n\nOther records were also matters of contention. \"We are hitting a critical point with the protest case documents,\" Buchanan wrote in October, referring to police records that could help the CCRB identify both officers and civilians. \"Many of them have been outstanding for a long time.\"\n\nThe CCRB did decide to go public about one roadblock. Officers had been refusing to do interviews by video, which the agency was using because of the pandemic. Hundreds of cases were stalled as a result. After the CCRB announced an emergency hearing about it in August, the NYPD ordered officers to participate in video interviews.\n\nBut the CCRB stayed quiet on other impediments, and staff were sometimes discouraged from raising them even with the NYPD itself. The agency's then-head of policy, Nicole Napolitano, wrote in a September email that she had been barred from asking the NYPD about its policies for retention of protest footage. \"I just spoke with Matt, and he's not a fan of me asking TARU any questions,\" Napolitano wrote, referring to the CCRB's general counsel, Matthew Kadushin, and the NYPD's Technical Assistance Response Unit.\n\nIn the same email, Napolitano noted that she had proposed writing a public report on the NYPD's response to the summer protests but that Kadushin had instructed her not to, saying it was too early.\n\nNapolitano, Buchanan and two other senior staffers, who together had more than 50 years of experience at the agency, were abruptly laid off in November in what the CCRB has described as a needed cost-saving restructuring. (The four staffers declined to comment for this article.)\n\nEmails show Buchanan had continued to follow up about the status of interviewing Monahan until the day he and the others were let go.\n\nThe four former staffers filed a lawsuit in January claiming that they were fired in part for \"demanding greater accountability and transparency with respect to the handling of complaints of police misconduct against NYPD officers.\" The suit, which asserts the four were illegally retaliated against for raising concerns, says Darche \"often skewed CCRB policies with a view towards currying favor with the NYPD and/or the Mayor's Office.\"\n\nIn one example from 2019 described in the suit, Darche objected to the term \"bias based policing\" and warned that any employees who used the phrase would be disciplined or fired.\n\nThe CCRB declined to comment on the former employees' lawsuit and did not make Darche or Kadushin available for interviews. The agency pointed to a previous statement by the chair of the CCRB, who was jointly appointed by the mayor and City Council Speaker Corey Johnson. \"The difficult but necessary restructuring the CCRB went through last year was motivated by a need for change during this difficult financial time for the City,\" said the chair, the Rev. Fred Davie.\n\nA City Hall spokesperson also said at the time that the mayor \"supports that step forward.\"\n\nThe CCRB's lack of independence has long stirred friction within the agency and with City Hall and the NYPD. Its powers have expanded over the years, most notably when it was given subpoena power in the early 1990s. But the agency, which has about 215 staffers and a $20 million budget, does not have direct access to body camera footage and other NYPD records. Instead, it effectively has to rely on the cooperation of the NYPD, which has a budget of nearly $6 billion and is the most powerful agency in city government.\n\nThe NYPD has repeatedly been cited for overly aggressive responses to large protests. \"It is deja vu all over again in some ways,\" said the head of New York City's Department of Investigation after issuing a scathing report on the NYPD's response to the Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nRead More\n\nDuring the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York, an NYPD commander on the scene told hundreds of peaceful protesters, \" Have a safe march ,\" then a few minutes later ordered them arrested.\n\nA federal judge later ruled there was \" not even arguable probable cause to make those arrests .\" The city eventually settled a lawsuit over the NYPD's RNC response for $18 million .\n\nThe commander at that scene? Terence Monahan.\n\nDo you have information to share about police oversight in New York City? Contact [email protected] .

      "text": "ProPublica logo\n\nWendi C. Thomas is a black journalist who has covered police in Memphis. One officer admitted to spying on her. She's on a long list of prominent black journalists and activists who have been subjected to police surveillance over decades.\n\nby Wendi C. Thomas , MLK50: Justice Through Journalism\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nThis article was produced in partnership with the MLK50: Justice Through Journalism, a member of the ProPublica Local Reporting Network .\n\nMEMPHIS, Tenn. - On Aug. 20, 2018, the first day of a federal police surveillance trial, I discovered that the Memphis Police Department was spying on me.\n\nThe ACLU of Tennessee had sued the MPD, alleging that the department was in violation of a 1978 consent decree barring surveillance of residents for political purposes.\n\nI'm pretty sure I wore my pink gingham jacket - it's my summer go-to when I want to look professional. I know I sat on the right side of the courtroom, not far from a former colleague at the city's daily newspaper. I'd long suspected that I was on law enforcement's radar, simply because my work tends to center on the most marginalized communities, not institutions with the most power.\n\nOne of the first witnesses called to the stand: Sgt. Timothy Reynolds, who is white. To get intel on activists and organizers, including those in the Black Lives Matter movement, he'd posed on Facebook as a \"man of color,\" befriending people and trying to infiltrate closed circles.\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nProjected onto a giant screen in the courtroom was a screenshot of people Reynolds followed on Facebook.\n\nMy head was bent as I wrote in my reporter's notebook. \"What does this entry indicate?\" ACLU attorney Amanda Strickland Floyd asked.\n\n\"I was following Wendi Thomas,\" Reynolds replied . \"Wendi C. Thomas.\"\n\nI sat up.\n\n\"And who is Wendi Thomas?\" Floyd asked.\n\nShe, he replied, used to write for The Commercial Appeal. In 2014, I left the paper after being a columnist for 11 years.\n\nIt's been more than a year since a judge ruled against the city, and I've never gotten a clear answer on why the MPD was monitoring me. Law enforcement also was keeping tabs on three other journalists whose names came out during the trial. Reynolds testified he used the fake account to monitor protest activity and follow current events connected to Black Lives Matter.\n\nMy sin, as best I can figure, was having good sources who were local organizers and activists, including some of the original plaintiffs in the ACLU's lawsuit against the city.\n\nIn the days since cellphone video captured white Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin squeezing the life out of George Floyd, a black man, residents in dozens of cities across the country have exercised their First Amendment rights to protest police brutality.\n\nHere in Memphis, where two-thirds of the population is black and 1 in 4 lives below the poverty line, demonstrators have chanted, \"No justice, no peace, no racist police!\"\n\nThe most recent protests were sparked by the killings of Floyd and of Breonna Taylor, a black woman gunned down in her home by Louisville, Kentucky, police in March. But in Memphis, like elsewhere, the seeds of distrust between activists and police were planted decades ago. And law enforcement has nurtured these seeds ever since.\n\nIn the mid-1960s, the MPD launched a domestic intelligence unit to spy not just on activists, but also on teachers' meetings, a college black student union and labor organizers. That included Martin Luther King Jr., who came to Memphis in the spring of 1968 to stand in solidarity with underpaid and mistreated black city sanitation workers.\n\nThe police surveillance wasn't conducted just with wiretaps and long lenses, but with snitches planted within local organizations, including spies planted by then-Mayor Henry Loeb, an anti-union segregationist, among sanitation workers who wanted to join a union.\n\nIn the iconic photo taken just moments after a gunman shot King on the Lorraine Motel balcony, several people are seen pointing in the direction from which the bullet came. Crouched over King's body is a man holding a towel to the gaping wound on King's face. The man, rarely identified in photos, is Marrell \"Mac\" McCollough , a Memphis cop who was assigned to infiltrate a militant activist group hated by Memphis police. There's no evidence he was involved with King's assassination.\n\nSome, including members of King's family, have long speculated that the assassination was not the work of a lone gunman but orchestrated by federal law enforcement agencies (the FBI famously monitored and harassed King). Both a U.S. House committee independent review in 1979 and a Department of Justice review in 2000 found no basis for this. Still, in 2002, the National Civil Rights Museum, which sits where the motel was, added to its permanent exhibits \"Lingering Questions,\" which contains hundreds of pieces of evidence, including the bullet plucked from King's body. One of the questions (that the exhibit does not definitively answer): \"Was the Memphis Police Department part of the conspiracy?\"\n\nBlack lives are being lost to COVID-19 at twice the rate of others. For protesters we talked to, that's one more reason to be on the street. \"If it's not police beating us up, it's us dying in a hospital from the pandemic,\" one said.\n\nIn 1976, the ACLU of Tennessee sued the city, alleging it had violated residents' First Amendment rights by maintaining records that \"contained unverified information and gossip which related exclusively to the exercise of lawful and peaceful activities,\" and, according to the complaint, \"served no lawful or valid law enforcement purpose.\"\n\nA judge agreed and in 1978 signed the Kendrick consent decree , the first such decree in the country, which barred law enforcement from surveilling protesters for political purposes.\n\nMany of today's protesters know about that ruling, because in 2017 the ACLU of Tennessee sued the city, alleging that police were violating the consent decree by again illegally spying on residents who were exercising their First Amendment rights.\n\nIn 2016, protesters had a series of high-profile demonstrations including a May protest at the Memphis Zoo, a spontaneous protest against police brutality in July in which hundreds blocked traffic on the Interstate 40 bridge and a December \"die-in\" in the mayor's front yard. After those, according to the lawsuit, the city started a blacklist of residents barred from City Hall without an escort.\n\nIt contained the names not just of those who had been arrested at demonstrations, but many who had not, including the mother of Darrius Stewart, a black teen police shot and killed in 2015 following a traffic stop, and a white grandmother who'd made it through a security blockade outside Graceland while black protesters were held back.\n\nReynolds' sleuthing made up a good part of the joint intelligence briefings, which were shared with law enforcement agencies and some of the city's largest corporations, such as FedEx and AutoZone, at the businesses' request. (Facebook told the MPD it violated the social platform's terms of service by creating fake accounts and impersonating others.)\n\nIn court, the city argued that the surveillance - videotaping demonstrations, using social media collators to sweep up posts about police and Black Lives Matters supporters - was necessary to protect public safety.\n\nBut while joint intelligence briefings and internal reports were ostensibly to keep track of potential threats, they were littered with unfounded rumors, misidentified photos of activists and surveillance reports of events that posed no clear threat, such as a black food truck festival.\n\nAnd while it's true that the pen is mightier than the sword, there's nothing about me that screams threat, unless critical reporting on public policy and public officials , including Mayor Jim Strickland, counts.\n\nIn 2017, MLK50: Justice Through Journalism covered the anniversary of the bridge protest , but when I tried to get an interview with the mayor, I was rebuffed.\n\n\"Objectivity dictates if the mayor does one on one interviews,\" wrote Ursula Madden, the city's chief communications officer in an email. \"You have demonstrated, particularly on social media, that you are not objective when it comes to Mayor Strickland.\"\n\nI replied that I was disappointed and asked her to point me to any errors of fact I'd made in my coverage. She did not respond.\n\nI've worked as a journalist in Memphis for the last 17 years. I've never been a victim of police brutality, but few of my interactions with police have inspired confidence.\n\nIn 2014, while I was at The Commercial Appeal, a reader threatened by email to rape me after a column I wrote about Confederate Gen. Nathan B. Forrest. I reluctantly reported the threat to police, but the investigation felt lackluster and no suspect was ever identified.\n\nIt nagged at me, and years later, when I tried to learn more about what steps the detective assigned to my case had taken, department officials refused to share any information, even the details of their interview with me.\n\nIn July 2015, I covered the demonstrations that followed Stewart's death by police. I interviewed the teen's father and posted the video on Instagram.\n\nA few days later, a cousin I hadn't seen in years stopped by. He wanted to take a quick tour through downtown Memphis. It was dark and rainy. He's black with long locks and a beard.\n\nI wanted to be a good host, but before I left the house, I tweeted my hesitation: \"My cousin is in town for work, leaving tomorrow. He wants to see Downtown. My 1st thought: Do I want to risk an encounter w/ police?\"\n\nMy fear was not without cause: Less than two weeks earlier, Sandra Bland, a 28-year-old black woman, had been forced out of her car by an aggressive Texas cop who'd stopped her for failing to signal while changing lanes. A dashboard camera video caught her arrest and three days later, she was found dead in a jail cell. Authorities said she died by suicide.\n\nI was thinking about what happened to Bland and what had happened to Stewart, who had been shot to death by police following a traffic stop the same month.\n\nJust a few miles from home, flashing lights filled my rearview mirror. I pulled over, heart pounding.\n\nI hit record on my cellphone and placed it on the dashboard. You can't see the officer's face in the video, which I still have, but you can hear our voices over the windshield wipers. The officer, who was black, asked for my license. I handed it to him and asked why I'd been stopped.\n\nHe said my driver's side headlight was out, but when he leaned over to tap it, he said it was back on.\n\n\"I'm not trying to be Sandra Bland tonight,\" I told the officer.\n\nThe Memphis officer said he was trying to be a nice guy. \"You think I want to stand out here in the rain?\" he can be heard saying on video.\n\n\"Ms. Thomas,\" he said, reading my license. \"Ms. Wendi Thomas.\" I wondered if he recognized my byline. I offered to show him what I had just tweeted but he declined. \"Your headlights are working now,\" he said. \"You be safe, OK?\"\n\n\"Yeah, but what happens when somebody else pulls me over?\" I asked.\n\n\"I don't know what somebody else is gonna do,\" he said, \"but I know that if you do the right things, if you're doing the right things, then nothing else can happen but good.\"\n\nI now wonder if the police had been following me. The police department did not answer questions for this story.\n\nBut at the time, I was paralyzed by fear and wanted to avoid being pulled over again.\n\nI took side streets home.\n\nAfter Reynolds left the stand after naming me as someone he had followed, the judge took a short recess. I headed outside the courtroom and saw Reynolds headed to the elevator.\n\nI followed him. When the doors closed, I stuck out my hand and introduced myself. I asked: Why were you following me on social media?\n\nAlthough it was chilly in the courtroom, Reynolds was sweating. He said he couldn't talk about it.\n\nTwo days after Reynolds' testimony, I filed a public records request with the city of Memphis, asking for all joint intelligence briefings, emails or other documents that referenced me or any of the three other journalists that the MPD was following on social media.\n\nFour hundred and thirty three days later, the city produced the records - and I still don't understand what would make police see me as a threat worthy of surveillance in the name of public safety.\n\nContained in the documents: A screenshot of a Facebook post that I made on Jan. 28, 2016, while I was on a fellowship at Harvard University. I'd shared a notice about a grassroots coalition meeting to be held that day.\n\nIn a joint intelligence briefing was a screenshot of a tweet I'd been tagged in. The original tweet, which at the time police captured it had 11 likes and one retweet, was itself a screenshot of an offensive image a Memphis police officer had allegedly posted on Snapchat.\n\nOur country's long history of structural racism stands at the center of why police brutality, COVID-19 and the opioid crisis are disproportionately killing black Americans, including in Chicago.\n\nIn another police email was a February 2017 tweet I sent about an upcoming protest , which had been announced on Facebook. It got two likes.\n\nThe city of Memphis is pushing back against the judge's ruling. Its lawyers have asked the court to modify the consent decree, contending that the city can't participate in a Trump administration public safety partnership if it isn't allowed to share intelligence with federal agencies.\n\nMy battles with the city of Memphis didn't end with the lawsuit, unfortunately.\n\nIn 2018, I was trying to figure out which corporations had answered the mayor's call to financially subsidize police operations by funneling $6.1 million to the city through a secretive nonprofit, the Memphis Shelby Crime Commission .\n\nStrickland wouldn't divulge the companies' identities, but he realized that public records I'd requested would. So the mayor's staff, in conjunction with the Crime Commission and another secretive nonprofit, came up with a plan to release the companies' names to local journalists before releasing the records to me, I learned through emails released in conjunction with a 2018 public records lawsuit against the Crime Commission.\n\nAnd this year, I was forced to sue the city after it refused to include me on its media email advisory list despite repeated requests.\n\nThe city of Memphis did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\n\nMy experiences have shaped the way my newsroom has covered more recent protests, including those in Memphis since Floyd's death.\n\nA guide on covering protests from the Racial Equity in Journalism Fund at Borealis Philanthropy notes, \"Understand how police use news coverage to surveil black communities. Don't allow police to use you, or your coverage, to do their jobs.\"\n\nWe applied these principles to our recent coverage of a civil disobedience training that drew more than 350 people. While we know the names of the people we talked to, if participants weren't comfortable using their whole name or showing their entire face, we protected their identity.\n\nAfter all, I know how it feels to know that the police are watching you.\n\nWe want to hear from police officers, public employees and community members who can help us learn more about police misconduct and why it's allowed to continue.\n\nGet our investigations delivered to your inbox with the Big Story newsletter.\n\nCreative Commons License (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)\n\nThank you for your interest in republishing this story.

      "text": "Black Lives Matter Activists Want to End Police Violence. But They Disagree on How to Do It\n\nT he activists who have flooded city streets since the death of George Floyd all broadly agree on the systemic injustice that has caused the nationwide uprising . They all want to end mass incarceration, dismantle structural racism and end the police killings of black men and women across the country.\n\nBut tactical differences have emerged between different camps of activists in the seven years since Black Lives Matter first became a national rallying cry. Some activists have adopted a reformist approach, pushing successfully to equip cops with body cameras, require implicit-bias training and encourage community policing. Others, seeing those measures fail to reduce the number of black deaths at the hands of police, are pushing for more aggressive strategies that weaken or eliminate police altogether. All these activists are committed to the same ends, but they don't all agree on the means.\n\nThere are three broad and overlapping camps within the vast, decentralized network of activists that make up the movement for racial justice in America. The first advocates for a series of reforms to create more accountability for police departments and strictly regulate the use of force, informed by what has and has not worked in the past. The second is increasingly focused on defunding police departments, directing taxpayer money away from law enforcement and towards social services that benefit black communities. The last also aims to redirect funding away from police departments, but considers it a step towards an ultimate goal of abolishing policing altogether.\n\nSome of the leaders in the reform camp banded together after the Ferguson protests to form organizations like Campaign Zero. \"In 2014, we were in the early stage of learning the solutions. We knew to protest, but we didn't know the answers,\" says Deray Mckesson, civil-rights activist and co-founder of Campaign Zero . \"We knew things that had worked here and there, but we didn't know what could be a scaled solution.\"\n\nOver the last six years, McKesson says, Campaign Zero has learned what doesn't work. More body cameras, community policing, mental health support for officers, implicit bias training, and having more police officers of color are all reforms that have been tried in various departments. But they don't actually result in fewer people being killed by police, Mckesson says. \"I think that there was a period of time where people thought training might be helpful, community policing might be helpful,\" he says. \"There is a consensus now that those things don't work.\"\n\nInstead, Mckesson says, Campaign Zero is focused on strategies that both \"reduce the power\" and \"shrink the role\" of existing police departments. One step is getting rid of police-union contracts, he says, which often protect bad cops and prevent police chiefs and mayors from making significant reforms. A 2018 study from the University of Chicago found that after Florida sheriffs' offices were allowed to unionize, violent misconduct such as use-of-force incidents increased 40% (off a very low base, the researchers said). University of Chicago law professor Dhammika Dharmapala, who co-authored the study, said that the findings suggested \"a large proportionate increase once an agency has the right to unionize.\"\n\nCampaign Zero has identified a set of eight specific use-of-force policies that, when taken together, could reduce police violence by more than 70%, according to the group. They include banning chokeholds and strangleholds; requiring de-escalation; requiring officers to issue a warning before shooting; exhausting all other means before shooting; requiring officers to intervene and stop excessive force by other officers and report them immediately; banning shooting at moving vehicles; developing regulations governing when force can be used; and requiring officers to file reports every time they use force.\n\nAlready, the hashtag #8CantWait has gone viral on social media, as activists call their local leaders to demand these specific reforms. Celebrities like Oprah Winfrey and Jack Dorsey have come out in support, and Campaign Zero says it has heard from government officials in San Antonio, Houston, and Los Angeles. Advocates of this approach note that unlike long fights over budget cuts, many of these policies can be implemented immediately. \"The police are here today,\" Mckesson says. \"And today they can have less power.\"\n\nBut other activists are skeptical that reforms will be enough to stem the violence. Some have pointed out that versions of some of these policies have been implemented in cities across the country, and yet black people continue to die. There's a growing sense inside much of the movement that police are inherently violent and racist, that no amount of reform will ever solve the problem, and that a true solution requires rethinking policing altogether.\n\nInstead, these activists say, police departments need to be either significantly defunded or even abolished altogether. The taxpayer dollars spent on policing, they argue, need to be redirected to social programs that could strengthen black communities or stop violence before it starts.\n\nAlicia Garza, founder of the Black Futures Lab and one of the women who coined the phrase #BlackLivesMatter, says that even after 26 criminal-justice reform laws passed in 40 states since 2013, \"not much has changed.\" About a thousand people are killed at the hands of police every year, according to MappingPoliceViolence.org, and the victims are still disproportionately black. That's why Garza believes true change entails stemming the flow of taxpayer money to police.\n\n\"Overwhelmingly, the largest percentage of most city budgets and state budgets is relating to policing and militarism,\" says Garza. \"Every machine that you see on the streets costs hundreds of thousands of dollars that could be used for affordable housing, coronavirus testing and resilience support.\"\n\nThe law-enforcement presence at the nationwide protests has showcased the immense resources funneled to local police departments, even as doctors and nurses were left to fight COVID-19 without enough equipment or supplies. To that end, activists and major institutions have been calling for major reductions in police funding in city budgets. The ACLU recently called to defund law enforcement and reinvest in communities of color. After pushing for raises for police officers, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti now says he plans to make cuts to the police budget . In New York, activists are calling on Mayor Bill de Blasio to slash the NYPD's $6 billion budget.\n\nSome of the activists calling for defunding police departments see it as a step towards the ultimate goal of abolishing police altogether. \"There shouldn't even be a moderate Democrat right now who doesn't believe that we should be taking resources from police departments and reinvesting them in building black futures,\" says Jessica Byrd, founder of ThreePoint Strategies, who leads the electoral-justice project at the Movement for Black Lives.\n\nEnding police violence, Byrd says, will require a \"radical shift in policing-not a little bit, not reform, not body cams, not new training,\" she says, but rather \"a radical shift in the way we think about protecting our communities and public safety.\"\n\n\"It's enraging that this is radical,\" Byrd adds. \"Me saying that taxpayer dollars should not fund those helicopters is radical.\"\n\nEven though abolishing the police may be politically impossible right now, experts say the movement is laying the groundwork for a longterm shift in how best to keep people safe. \"No one is in a position to say 'tomorrow we flip a magic switch and there are no police,\" says Alex Vitale, a professor of sociology at Brooklyn College and author of The End of Policing. But he points to other areas of society where consensus has developed that police are not the solution: in rich white communities, for example, when a teenager is caught with drugs, they are usually sent to rehab and not jail.\n\n\"People are demanding that we have a bigger conversation about the kind of society that we have that requires so much policing and prisons,\" Vitale says. \"And trying to begin a conversation about what a world without that would look like.\"\n\nWrite to Charlotte Alter at charlotte.alter@time.com"

      "text": "93% of Black Lives Matter Protests Have Been Peaceful, New Report Finds\n\nT he vast majority of Black Lives Matter protests -more than 93%-have been peaceful, according to a new report published Thursday by a nonprofit that researches political violence and protests across the world.\n\nThe Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) analyzed more than 7,750 Black Lives Matter demonstrations in all 50 states and Washington D.C. that took place in the wake of George Floyd's death between May 26 and August 22.\n\nTheir report states that more than 2,400 locations reported peaceful protests, while fewer than 220 reported \"violent demonstrations.\" The authors define violent demonstrations as including \"acts targeting other individuals, property, businesses, other rioting groups or armed actors.\" Their definition includes anything from \"fighting back against police\" to vandalism, property destruction looting, road-blocking using barricades, burning tires or other materials. In cities where protests did turn violent-these demonstrations are \"largely confined to specific blocks,\" the report says.\n\nThe ACLED report includes protests toppling statues of \"colonial figures, slave owners and Confederate leaders\" as violent incidents. \"Since Floyd's killing, there have been at least 38 incidents in which demonstrators have significantly damaged or torn down memorials around the country,\" the report states.\n\nStill, many people continue to believe that Black Lives Matter protests are largely violent-contrary to the report's findings. ACLED highlights a recent Morning Consult poll in which 42% of respondents believe \"most protesters (associated with the BLM movement) are trying to incite violence or destroy property.\" ACLED suggests this \"disparity stems from political orientation and biased media framing ... such as disproportionate coverage of violent demonstrations.\"\n\nU.S.-based ACLED is funded by the State Department's Bureau of Conflict and Stabilization Operations as well as foreign governments and other organizations, including the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the German Federal Foreign Office, the Tableau Foundation, the International Organization for Migration, and The University of Texas at Austin. It relied on data collection from the U.S. Crisis Monitor -a joint project led by ACLED and Princeton University's Bridging Divides Initiative -that tracks and publishes real-time data on political violence and demonstrations in the U.S in order to \"establish an evidence base from which to identify risks, hotspots and available resources to empower local communities in times of crisis.\"\n\nACLED also highlights a \"violent government response,\" in which authorities \"use force more often than not\" when they are present at protests and that they \"disproportionately used force while intervening in demonstrations associated with the BLM movement, relative to other types of demonstrations.\" The report also references \"dozens of car-ramming attacks\" on protesters by various individuals, some of whom have ties to hate groups like the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nACLED warns in the report that the U.S. \"is at heightened risk of political violence and instability going into the 2020 general election,\" citing trends in mass shootings, violent hate crimes and police killings. The authors of the report say the Trump administration has exacerbated tensions caused by racial inequality and police brutality. President Donald Trump and high-ranking members of his administration have frequently generalized protesters as violent anarchists .\n\nWrite to Sanya Mansoor at sanya.mansoor@time.com"

      "text": "How Black Lives Matter Is Changing What Students Learn During Black History Month\n\nF reshman year can make anyone feel lost, but Seattle teen Janelle Gary felt especially lost when she entered high school in 2015. At home, she watched a wave of gentrification drive change in the historically black Central District neighborhood, and at school, where she was one of the few students of color in an honors history class, she felt as if black perspectives were also in the minority.\n\nLooking back at that time, as now-18-year-old freshman at Central Washington University, she feels her teacher was \"tip-toeing\" around hard race-related questions about history. But things were different in her Ethnic Studies class, where her teacher Jesse Hagopian remembered what it was like to be the only black kid in a class.\n\nThat memory - and the lasting impact of a college class that looked at race head-on - is part of the reason why Hagopian, 41, and other educators inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement organized a national Black Lives Matter at School Week of Action , now in its third year. What started locally in Seattle in 2016, inspired by a federal investigation into the higher rate of suspensions of black students compared to their white peers, has grown into a nationwide organizing effort.\n\nIn 2020, teachers - including in the country's three largest school districts, in New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago - will wear \"Black Lives Matter\" shirts to school as they teach lessons on black history and race issues from Feb. 3 to Feb. 7. The organizers are also calling for Black History and Ethnic Studies to be a graduation requirement in K-12 schools.\n\nTheirs is not a new call to action. They are driven by the same feeling James Baldwin described in 1963: \"I began to be bugged by the teaching of American history, because it seemed that history had been taught without cognizance of my presence.\" It is also the same feeling that in 1926 drove Carter G. Woodson, who is known as \"the Father of Black History,\" to urge educators to set aside a week in February \"for the purpose of emphasizing what has already been learned about the Negro during the year\"; what he started became Black History Month in 1976.\n\nAnd yet, from that old feeling, they are helping Black History Month - and the year-round teaching of the topic - evolve to a new stage.\n\n\"I definitely think that Black Lives Matter encouraged people to learn about other movements that came before,\" says Tatiana Amaya, 19, a freshman at Claremont McKenna College who took a required black history course in her Philadelphia high school. \"It's central to understanding that black oppression still exists today.\"\n\nCarter G. Woodson knew about history. After all, in 1912 he became the second African American to earn a PhD in history from Harvard, after only W.E.B. DuBois. So he could see that history was being distorted - especially, in 1915, by The Birth of a Nation . The enormously successful movie painted a white supremacist vision of the American past, and inspired a resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nThe movie came out that February, and that September Woodson founded the Association for the Study of Negro Life and History, now the Association for the Study of African American Life and History.\n\n\"You had this understanding from the historical profession, from popular media, from literary works, that African Americans have no history, and if they are written about in history, it's not something that is respectable,\" says Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, chair of the History Department at Harvard University and the current National President of the Association for the Study of African American Life and History. \"Woodson started an organization, and literally a movement that exists to this day to correct those lies.\"\n\nWhile black people had been educating each other about their history for decades , vital new textbooks came out in the years that followed, such as Woodson's The Negro in Our History (1922) and, later, John Hope Franklin's From Slavery to Freedom (first published in 1947). Woodson's Negro History Bulletin also circulated to churches and public schools. The civil rights movement of the '50s, '60s and '70s led to further growth of this discipline, even inspiring student walkouts calling for black history classes, and the social movements of that period led to a shift toward teaching that history through the stories of ordinary people who laid the groundwork for larger change. By the time Black History Month was formally declared in 1976, the Black Power movement had fueled a new emphasis on \"what's unique about being a black person in America,\" says Higginbotham.\n\nAnd many educators say that, just as a moment of crisis for African Americans fueled Woodson's original vision, this moment in time is proving to be a new turning point for black history as a discipline.\n\n\"Whenever there's a tragedy in black America, there's always been an uptick of black history courses, most recently [with] Black Lives Matter and police shootings,\" says LaGarrett King, Professor of Social Studies Education and Founding Director of the Carter Center for K12 Black History Education at the University of Missouri. Social media has fueled discussion among teachers on how to contextualize these current events, such as Twitter hashtags like #FergusonSyllabus, #CharlestonSyllabus and #CharlottesvilleSyllabus, and teachers say that current events have piqued students' interests, especially after Colin Kaepernick' s kneeling during the national anthem.\n\n\"I have spent so much time talking about Black Lives Matter over the last two years and I've had to weave Black Lives Matter into my lectures on various topics because students - both K-12 and college level - heard about the movement,\" says Keisha N. Blain, a historian who co-founded the #CharlestonSyllabus, \"and they wanted to figure out how does this connect to what happened in the '60s or even earlier.\"\n\nStep Into History: Learn how to experience the 1963 March on Washington in virtual reality\n\nBut for the most part, educators say, K-12 students who do learn about black history are hearing about the same few historical figures over and over: Martin Luther King Jr., Rosa Parks, Harriet Tubman and former President Barack Obama. While those lives are undoubtedly worthy of study, they do not exist in a vacuum.\n\nThat's why LaGarrett King describes the state of the teaching of black history in schools as \"steadily improving, yet still stagnant.\"\n\n\"One of the problems with getting black history right is we are still trying to use this notion that black history is American history, which sounds good,\" says King. But, he says, that creates a problem when American history is taught, as it often is, as a story in which \"every generation has improved our society.\"\n\nThe problem with that perspective can be seen, for example, in the teaching of the 20th century civil rights movement, which tends to be where black history ends in many American schools, says Christopher Busey, a University of Florida professor who has researched Black History in social studies standards. When the narrative ends at the victories of the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act, it can be hard for students to make the connection between that optimistic ending and the problems of today. \"When we have more contemporary movements such as Black Lives Matter, people are largely unable to make sense of it because we skipped the war on drugs with Reagan and the targeting of black communities by police,\" he says. \"Their last conceptions of black citizenship are tied to this idea that we all had a dream, we overcame, and Obama was elected President.\"\n\nIn addition, black stories often end up told through a white lens. Stories of black people resisting white supremacy in any way other than nonviolent protest may be left out, while the study of oppression can crowd out the study of African contributions to society, from the libraries and intellectual life of Timbuktu to the earliest calendars and forms of mathematics .\n\n\"If the first time that black people enter the school curriculum is through when they're enslaved,\" says King, \"that gives the impression these particular people were not that important to American democracy and didn't contribute to the intellectual development of the country.\"\n\nParadoxically, while slavery and the civil rights movement may be the most recognizable black history subject areas, the quality of what students are learning about these topics has come into question recently. A 2018 survey by the Southern Poverty Law Center found that only 8% of high school seniors could identify slavery as the main cause of the Civil War. The same organization produced a 2014 \"report card\" on state standards and resources on the teaching of the history of the civil rights movement nationwide, and gave 20 states a failing grade. The biggest issue across the board was \"sanitized\" history, including resources that made it sound as if civil rights was just a Southern problem, and a lack of sufficient discussion about the hard realities of the violent resistance to the movement.\n\nGet your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter\n\nNow, however, there are signs of change. Many people in the mostly-white U.S. teacher population haven't taken a dedicated course in black history and are learning as they go, but Ursula Wolfe-Rocca, 44, a white high-school social studies teacher who teaches black history lessons year-round at a predominantly white school district in the Portland, Ore., area, says it's crucial that educators become better equipped to teach the subject. Otherwise, \"it reinforces the fundamental flaw, which is that black history is seen as peripheral,\" she says. \"The answer to why do white kids need black history is that it is history and it's their history too. It's a shared collective past.\"\n\nSeven states launched commissions designed to oversee state mandates to teach black history in public schools in recent years, and Illinois requires public colleges and universities to offer black history courses. To meet the rising demand for resources, at least six Black History textbooks are on the market, as well as lesson plans on websites including Teaching Tolerance , Teaching for Change , Zinn Education Project and Rethinking Schools . (The most-downloaded lessons from the Zinn Education Project website for most of 2019 were about Reconstruction .)\n\nIn 2005, Philadelphia became the first major American city to require students to take a black history class to graduate. Confining black history lessons to February, as many schools do, is \"the exact opposite\" of what Woodson envisioned, says Greg Carr, Chair of the Department of Afro-American Studies at Howard University, who led the team that developed the Philadelphia curriculum.\n\nIn addition, to give students more perspective on black experiences worldwide, an Advanced Placement seminar on the African Diaspora, developed by Columbia University's Teachers College, the University of Notre Dame and Tuskegee University, is being piloted in 11 schools in the 2019-2020 year, up from two in 2017-2018 school year. There are also lesson plans available based on Henry Louis Gates Jr.'s 2017 PBS documentary Africa's Great Civilizations .\n\nData on the impact of learning African and African-American history are hard to come by, but there are already indications that new curricula are making a difference for some students. In the 2018-2019 school year, for example, 80% of students - including under-performing students - in five schools that offered the AP African Diaspora pilot passed, according to Kassie Freeman, who played a key role in developing the seminar and is a senior faculty fellow at the Institute for Urban and Minority Education at Teachers College and President of the African Diaspora Consortium.\n\nSome of the impact is harder to quantify, but no less real.\n\nAfter taking Philadelphia's required class in 9th grade, Maye-gan Brown, now a 22-year-old Muhlenberg College senior, realized \"how much we center black men when it comes to civil rights,\" she says. \"A lot of the time we left out women like Fannie Lou Hamer. \" Since Philadelphia teacher Abigail Henry, 36, started organizing mock trials on subjects such as whether George Washington \"promoted the institution of slavery,\" she's noticed that students who are usually quiet and withdrawn have earned some of the highest grades. Makaia Loya, 17, a student in Denver, says it was a lesson about Malcolm X's 1964 speech \"The Ballot or the Bullet\" that reshaped her career goals: \"I grew up thinking, 'I'm getting as far as I can from the ghetto,'\" she says, \"and now I'm like, as soon as I Ieave and have something to bring back, I'm coming back.\" And Pascagoula, Miss., senior Kinchasa Anderson, 18, says that a field trip last fall to Medgar Evers ' house in Jackson, Miss., gave her a new appreciation for how that history affects her life today.\n\n\"It just struck me - these people really put their life on the line for us,\" she says, \"for my generation, for generations to come.\"\n\nAnd in that feeling, these students are themselves part of the connection between history and lived experience. As Jeanne Theoharis writes in The Rebellious Life of Mrs. Rosa Parks, Rosa Parks' political awakening began at a young age, when she learned what an understanding of black history could do.\n\n\"The revelation of black history would indelibly shape Rosa McCauley Parks's life,\" Theoharis writes. \"She saw the history of black survival, accomplishment, and rebellion as the ultimate weapon against white supremacy.\"\n\nCorrection, Jan. 31\n\nThe original version of this story misstated which social media resources guide historian Keisha N. Blain co-founded.

      "text": "The Asian American Response to Black Lives Matter Is Part of a Long, Complicated History\n\nI n the United States, issues of race can often be cast along the lines of Black and white - and, especially at a moment when the world is being forced to confront the ways systemic racism is built into the nation's history, the reasons for that focus are clear. At the same time, the land has never been inhabited by only those two groups, and the ways in which other minorities interact with both Black America and white America offer key insight into that past. Case in point: The complex histories of both anti-Blackness and anti-racist solidarity within the Asian American community.\n\nIn this week's issue of TIME, Pulitzer Prize winner Viet Thanh Nguyen explored the ways in which the \"trap\" of being a \"model minority\" creates inequality not just for Asian Americans, but for everyone. That dynamic has come to the forefront especially in light of the presence of Tou Thao, an Asian American officer, at the death of George Floyd. One viral tweet compared Thao to the sole Asian man amid the white bidders in the movie Get Out, while Hasan Minhaj tackled anti-Blackness in the Asian American community in a new Patriot Act clip, noting: \"We think we're not a part of the story, but we're at the scene of the crime! That's why the full picture matters. This doesn't happen in a vacuum - it happens in a system.\"\n\nThat system is one that has been evolving for centuries, and still influences the work of many Asian American activists today.\n\nIn the 19th and early 20th centuries, Asian Americans working as immigrant laborers in the U.S. were villainized (and often subjected to horrendous racial violence ) as the sinister \"Yellow Peril.\" That experience of discrimination created solidarity with the Black community, which, says Renee Tajima-Peña, the producer of Who Killed Vincent Chin? and PBS' documentary series Asian American, was expressed in a wide range of outlets. Frederick Douglass denounced the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, and an Indian immigrant served as the editor of Negro World in the early 20th century.\n\nThat connection endured into the decades that followed. But, as with many facets of life in the U.S., things got more complicated around the 1960s.\n\nOn one hand, as the civil rights movement introduced new ways of thinking about justice and equality in the United States, Asian American leaders drew inspiration from-and provided support for-Black freedom fighters. For example, after Japanese Americans were seen as threats and sent to detention camps during WWII , that community offered support to Civil Rights leaders trying to repeal the Emergency Detention Act over concerns that Black activists could be subject to the same kind of treatment. The term \"Asian American\" was coined in 1968 by UC Berkeley students who were inspired by the Black Power Movement; likewise, Asian American students rallied alongside Black student organizers and other ethnic student groups as part of the Third World Liberation Front at San Francisco State and UC Berkeley in the late '60s, which culminated in student strikes that led to equal education opportunities and the creation of ethnic studies programs . Activists like Yuri Kochiyama and Grace Lee Boggs not only pulled insights from Black radical frameworks for Asian American liberation, but were also strong and active advocates for Black social justice movements.\n\nAt the same time, however, the model minority myth was spreading. This idea posited that Asian Americans were more successful than other ethnic minorities because of hard work, education and inherently law-abiding natures. But many of the advances of Asian Americans around the time of the 1960s were not the result of hard work alone, but also of the same systemic forces that held others down-such as immigration policies (like the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965, which abolished former anti-Asian immigration laws and prioritized skilled workers) and political spin constructed to counter the civil rights movement.\n\n\"Before the model minority myth, Asians and Asian Americans were exploited for their labor, othered, seen as 'Yellow Peril,'\" says Bianca Mabute-Louie, an ethnic studies adjunct at Laney College. \"[The myth] came about when Black power movements were starting to gain momentum, so [politicians] were trying to undercut those movements and say, 'Asians have experienced racism in this country, but because of hard work, they've been able to pull themselves up out of racism by their bootstraps and have the American Dream, so why can't you?' In those ways, the model minority myth has really been a tool of white supremacy to squash Black power movements and racial justice movements.\"\n\nAs Mabute-Louie notes, not only does such a myth create a monolithic identity for Asian Americans and render their struggles invisible, but it also drives a wedge between them and other communities of color, primarily Black Americans, because it uses perceived Asian American \"success\" to invalidate claims of inequality toward non-white Americans. It also reinforces a structure in which assimilation into white society is the primary goal for other ethnic groups.\n\n\"To say that this minority is the 'good minority' means you're essentially saying there's a bad minority, which keeps people divided,\" says writer and activist Helen Zia. \"The problem is, when you hold a carrot out, some people start believing that we can shed this previous portrayal and stereotype of being the enemy and we can be accepted, we can move up, we can reap the privileges of the white masters, we can maybe even become honorary whites.\"\n\nGet your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter\n\nThis dynamic did not mean the end of solidarity between the two communities: when Vincent Chin was beaten to death as a result of racism in Detroit in 1982 , for example, Black activists like Jesse Jackson were a part of the movement to call for justice for his murder. But it did drive a wedge between them, and that tension has loomed large in the mainstream narrative in recent history, thanks in large part to events that took place in Los Angeles in 1992.\n\nThat year, L.A. erupted in protests and riots after four police officers who were caught on camera brutally beating Rodney King , a Black motorist, were acquitted. During the riots, Korean-American businesses appeared to be targets for looting and destruction- which many connected to the 1991 killing of Latasha Harlins , a 15-year-old Black girl, by a Korean immigrant store owner, Soon Ja Du, who shot Harlins after assuming that she was stealing a bottle of orange juice. Although Du was convicted of voluntary manslaughter later that year, the perceived lightness of her sentence helped stoke the flames for the civil unrest ignited for Rodney King.\n\nIn the years since, interracial conflict has often served as the primary framework for looking at interactions between Black and Asian American communities. From a 2017 viral video that documented a Korean beauty store owner physically attacking a Black customer he suspected of shoplifting; to some Asian Americans' advocacy for eliminating race-conscious school admissions; to the division of the Asian American community in New York over NYPD police office Peter Liang, after he was convicted for manslaughter after fatally shooting an unarmed Black man, Akai Gurley , conversations about race between these two communities often center on anti-Black actions and beliefs.\n\nBut, experts say, that tension is still far from the whole picture.\n\n\"Conflict has always been a central part of the story, but it's because it's much more sensational to talk about Asians and African Americans fighting than it is to talk about the day-to-day work of finding solutions to problems and working together,\" says producer Tajima-Peña . \"Toni Morrison talks about a master narrative, not written by us, and that narrative [of these two communities] has always been conflict and tension.\"\n\nNow, as the U.S. sees mass uprisings against racial injustice and police brutality, some see a chance to continue the history of solidarity, and put the history of division to the side. While Asian Americans still experience racism-one only need look as far as the spike in violent anti-Asian attacks in recent months, due to the coronavirus pandemic , for proof-in the United States they don't experience the same level of structural racism that those who are Black do, and the recognition of that fact has driven many into activism.\n\n\"Asian Americans owe so much of their presence in this country to the Black struggle for freedom - from birthright citizenship to the ability to tell our stories in education and the culture to the civil rights we enjoy,\" says Jeff Chang, the author of We Gon' Be Alright: Notes on Race and Resegregation . \" We want to be on the right side of history, and that side is squarely in fighting against anti-Black racism.\"\n\nSome Asian Americans have focused on calling out racism in a way that speaks specifically to their own communities and families. For example, Letters for Black Lives , an organization that provides multi-lingual resources to help people talk about Black Lives Matter with their families, was started by young Asian Americans in 2016; the group has now updated their templates to reflect more recent news. And Dr. Anthony C. Ocampo, an associate professor of sociology at Cal Poly Pomona, created a slide deck presentation with his cousins to talk to their family about what's going on in the news and how it relates to structural racism.\n\nOthers are creating resources designed to educate and inform Asian Americans about how their history has intersected with Black history. Mabute-Louie has been making shareable Instagram 'zines that not only address how to fight anti-Blackness, but also provide context about the history of Asian American and Black solidarity. \"There are a lot of resources out there on how to be anti-racist and a lot of books about white fragility,\" she says. \"But a lot of the things I'm seeing is catered and made for white people to engage and we as Asian Americans have a very different journey.\"\n\nUltimately, however, no matter what the method, these activists share a core belief that how Asian Americans respond in this moment will not only reflect this shared history but also help shape the futures of both these communities.\n\n\"The power of Asian Americans standing up for Black Lives Matters is that it sends a clear message: the same racist logic schemes that are keeping our communities down might look different in Black communities than they look in Asian American communities, but it's still the same system. [It's] meant to relegate us to the margins, to keep us in subordinate positions, to keep us out of leadership positions, to basically be in a position where we can't write our own stories in this country,\" Ocampo says. \"We need to be the authors of our story.\"\n\nCorrection, June 27\n\nDue to an editing error, the original version of this article misstated how many Asian American officers were present at the death of George Floyd. There was one, not two.\n\nWrite to Cady Lang at cady.lang@timemagazine.com"

      "text": "From Donating to Volunteering: Here's How to Support Black Lives Matter, Protesters and Equality Initiatives\n\nA s the nation reels from the police killing of George Floyd and reckons with institutional racism, many are left wondering: what can they do?\n\nTens of thousands of people have already shown up to protests across the country-in both big cities and rural towns -to demand racial justice and sweeping changes, from police reforms like mandatory body cameras and implicit-bias training, to defunding the institution and allocating city or state budget funds to community groups.\n\nIf you want to show up for the cause but are not able to protest in the streets, there are many ways to engage, from educating yourself to volunteering, spreading awareness and donating money.\n\nYou can donate to Black Lives Matter , which was founded in 2013 after the neighborhood watch volunteer who fatally shot Trayvon Martin was acquitted.\n\nYou can also consider organizations committed to ending mass incarceration and extreme sentencing, like the Equal Justice Initiative, which provides legal representation to people who have been wrongly convicted, unfairly sentenced or abused in state jails and prisons. Some groups, like the National Council For Incarcerated and Formerly Incarcerated Women and Girls , are particularly focused on helping female inmates and ex-convicts.\n\nThose who want to make a long-term grassroots impact can donate to local mutual aid funds, like the COVID-19 Mutual Aid Network - Los Angeles , The Metro Atlanta Mutual Aid Fund or East of the River Mutual Aid Fund. Mutual aid funds work to address homelessness and systemic inequalities by offering all sorts of community assistance, from providing food to financial help to people in need. Many right now are focusing on helping those struggling during the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately infected and killed those in the black community, by providing materials like masks and hygiene kits.\n\nBail funds have had a particularly busy two weeks as thousands of protesters have been detained across the U.S. These funds are typically collectives driven by volunteers working to raise money to free people incarcerated on bail, as well as to advocate for systemic bail reform.\n\nIn the aftermath of Floyd's death, many bail funds, like the Minnesota Freedom Fund , have been inundated with donations and are now suggesting that donors redirect their money to other bail funds and organizations in need. But many say they still need help.\n\nYou can choose to donate to a bail fund in your city or state; the National Bail Fund Network lists a number of bail funds by state.\n\nYou can give money to national bail organizations, like National Bail Out and The Bail Project , or other groups focusing on helping specific communities, like the Black Trans Protesters Emergency Fund or the LGBTQ Fund .\n\nActBlue-a nonprofit that facilitates small-dollar donations online, often to progressive groups-has organized a way for people to split donations between up to more than 70 groups at once, including community bail funds, mutual aid funds, and racial justice organizers.\n\nYou can directly help grieving black families whose loved ones have been unjustly killed by giving to fundraisers set up to help cover the costs of funeral and legal expenses, grief counseling and often to set up educational or memorial grants in honor of those who have been killed.\n\nPhilonise Floyd has set up a memorial fund for his brother, George Floyd. You can donate to Floyd's family through this GoFundMe.\n\nAhmaud Arbery was shot and killed while running in a residential area in South Georgia on Feb. 23. Gregory McMichael and his son, Travis McMichael, were charged with murder and aggravated assault in Arbery's death after video footage of the incident circulated on social media and sparked national outrage. You can donate to Arbery's family through this GoFundMe .\n\nThe uproar over Floyd's killings has raised concerns about why black women and girls may still be an afterthought amid widespread outrage over police killings. Breonna Taylor, an EMT who aspired to be a nurse, was sleeping when a police officer shot and killed her in March. You can donate to Taylor's family through this GoFundMe .\n\nDavid McAtee was known for offering free meals to police officers in Louisville. He was fatally shot as the police and National Guard responded to protesters. The Louisville police chief was fired earlier this month after the mayor learned police officers involved in the shooting had not activated their body cameras during the incident. (Authorities had said law enforcement was returning McAtee's gunfire.) You can donate to McAtee's family through this GoFundMe .\n\nSupporting black-owned businesses, especially now, could be crucial to helping them stay operational during the pandemic.\n\nBlack-owned businesses often have trouble securing loans and had issues accessing federal aid programs designed to alleviate the economic burden for small businesses struggling to stay afloat amid stay-at-home orders. A national online survey of 500 African-American and Latinx-owned small businesses conducted by the Global Strategy Group released May 13-after the second round of funding for the program was allocated-found that just 12% received the full assistance they requested, with two-thirds reporting that they did not receive any.\n\nVICE has a guide on how to find black-owned restaurants by state. New York Magazine has a list of not just food companies but also beauty, clothing and fitness brands among others. If you live in the Bay Area , the SFist has a comprehensive guide on how to find black-owned businesses to support. Eater has guides on black-owned restaurants in various cities, from Nashville to New York City.\n\nIf you can't protest or donate and want to help, you can also donate your time or energy.\n\nTo help protesters, you could provide childcare and/or meals for those attending rallies. Or sew masks to protect protesters, like one woman in Texas did .\n\nConsider if your skills or profession enables you to provide specialized skills to those in need. If you are involved with a restaurant or faith group with access to a large kitchen, you could consider providing food at a larger scale. For inspiration, they can look to Sikhs , who know how to feed crowds in a protest or a pandemic. In a Queens gurdwara-the place of worship for Sikhs-a group of about 30 cooks has served more than 145,000 free meals in just 10 weeks, the New York Times reports.\n\nIf you're a health care professional, you could help as a medic on the streets for protesters who are hurt by rubber bullets or tear gas-or share resources with those who are helping on the ground. If you know how to speak a language other than English, you can translate important documents and news about protests. If you're a lawyer, consider offering pro-bono services.\n\nYou can also become a legal observer and help document police action during protests. The National Lawyers Guild provides training; you can check with your local chapter for more information.\n\nDonating isn't the only way to help bail funds. You can volunteer your time and expertise, too.\n\nIf you're thinking of a more long-term commitment, consider mentoring or tutoring at-risk youth. And think about how to create lasting contributions however you're helping, whether that means setting up recurring donations, diversifying the media and literature you consume, as well supporting black-owned businesses.\n\nLasting change won't happen without actively deconstructing our beliefs about race. As many activists have pointed out, in order to make social and economic change in a society rife with institutional racism, it's not enough to not be racist , but rather people need to be actively anti-racist . For many people learning how to be a helpful ally, the best place to start is educating themselves and listening.\n\nTIME has curated lists on books to read and movies to watch to teach yourself about racism and protest history. Suggested literature includes the Ta-Nehisi Coates memoir Between the World and Me as well as a children's version of Ibram X. Kendi's bestseller How to Be an Antiracist, called Anti-Racist Baby (to be published June 16.)\n\nDocumentaries are a good place to start, too: 13th by Ava DuVernay, walks through the origins of the mass incarceration of black men, stretching all the way back to the ratification of the 13th Amendment in 1865. ( 13th is available on Netflix .) Whose Streets dives into the Black Lives Matter uprisings in Ferguson. ( Whose Streets is available on Hulu , Amazon Prime , YouTube , Google , Vudu )\n\nOnline resources, like this Google Doc on anti-racism resources for white people and this syllabus on \"becoming an active ally to the black community\" also point to informative materials to read and watch.\n\nFor non-black people, having sometimes uncomfortable conversations about racial justice, police violence, and anti-blackness with your own families and communities-even if English isn't their first language-can be helpful. Letters for Black Lives have compiled a letter translated into two dozen languages that can be a helpful framework to start that conversation with your own family.\n\nWrite to Sanya Mansoor at sanya.mansoor@time.com"

      "text": "America's Long Overdue Awakening to Systemic Racism\n\nIn Lafayette Park, just steps away from the White House, a wealthy hotelier ran a second business selling enslaved men and women to the highest bidder.\n\nHe kept them in a brick cell beside his mansion, and at night an observer recalled hearing \"their howls and cries.\"\n\nToday in the park there is no plaque, no bench and no monument, to paraphrase Toni Morrison , to memorialize the human lives brutalized there throughout much of the 19th century. After a hard-fought Civil War, the institution of chattel slavery was legally abolished as the U.S. nominally attempted to make racial violence a thing of the past. These days, in the public space situated across from the White House, one is likely to encounter instead an odd mix of office workers on lunch break and MAGA -hat-wearing tourists mingling around the hotelier's former mansion, known as Decatur House.\n\nOr at least, that was the scene before the past three weeks turned Lafayette Park into a crucible for the fight over the still-present legacy of slavery in America: systemic racism.\n\nJust before 7 p.m. on June 1, a deployment of local, state and federal forces, armored head to toe in riot gear, unleashed rubber bullets and sprayed tear gas onto a crowd of peaceful demonstrators gathered in the park to protest under the mantra \"Black Lives Matter.\" Moments after the crowd was forcibly dispersed, screaming as their eyes burned from the gas, President Donald Trump strolled out of the White House flanked by senior members of his Administration, triumphantly holding up a Bible so the press could snap a few photos.\n\nSince then, the debate over systemic racism has spread across the nation and around the world . Trump's Administration has repeatedly denied that discrimination against black Americans is embedded in the political, economic and social structure of the country. Trump believes there are \"injustices in society,\" his press secretary said, but she brushed aside the notion that antiblackness is intrinsic to U.S. law enforcement. His National Security Adviser, Robert O'Brien, said racist police are just a \"few bad apples,\" adding, \"we need to root them out.\" Attorney General William Barr warned against \"automatically assuming that the actions of an individual necessarily mean that their organization is rotten.\"\n\nBut, for all that's good about America, something is rotten. The protesters in Lafayette Park on June 1 may have been galvanized by the disturbing video of the murder of George Floyd , suffocated to death beneath the knee of a Minneapolis police officer just a week prior. But at the core of their movement is much more than the outrage over the latest instances of police brutality. Centuries of racist policy, both explicit and implicit, have left black Americans in the dust, physically, emotionally and economically. The U.S. may think it has brushed chattel slavery into the dustbin of history after the Civil War, but the country never did a very good job incinerating its traumatic remains, instead leaving embers that still burn today: an education system that fails black Americans, substandard health care that makes them more vulnerable to death and disease, and an economy that leaves millions without access to a living wage.\n\nPoliticians, activists and everyday people can and should debate what to do about this reality, but it is a reality, one evident in volumes of data, research and reporting, not to mention the lived experience of millions of African Americans each and every day. What is helping make this moment historic is that over these past weeks and months, much of the rest of the U.S. appears to have woken up to this truth too.\n\nThe crowds of protesters from Seattle to Miami include not just black youth, but a diverse array that looks something like the country itself. In 2015, in the wake of unrest in Ferguson, Mo. , just half of Americans said they believed racial discrimination to be a \"big problem,\" and, in 2016, only a third considered black Americans more likely to suffer from police brutality, according to Monmouth University polling. Today, by contrast, more than 75% of Americans say discrimination is a big problem and 57% understand that African Americans are more likely to suffer from police violence than other demographic groups are, a recent Monmouth poll found.\n\nMore broadly, the notion of \"systemic racism,\" once confined to academic and activist circles on the left of the spectrum, has become the phrase du jour, with Google searches for the term rising a hundredfold in a matter of months and mainstream conservatives like former President George W. Bush joining historically moderate Democrats like Joe Biden in embracing the term to call for a national reckoning.\n\nThis spreading recognition highlights an ever starker dividing line in America. On one side, a growing majority of the country is increasingly ready to repudiate its history of structural racism. On the other, many of those in power, especially at the White House, are eager to deny it. This is no surprise. By definition, systemic racism is embedded deep and wide across American society and, therefore, can't easily be rectified. But, for many of those who have spent their lives fighting for racial justice, this is a moment of reckoning that has been a long time coming. \"Not everything that is faced can be changed,\" James Baldwin , the black author and activist wrote in the manuscript of his memoir Remember This House , \"but nothing can be changed until it is faced.\"\n\nThe origins of America's unjust racial order lie in the most brutal institution of enslavement that human beings have ever concocted. More than 12 million Africans of all ages, shackled in the bottom of ships, were sold into a lifetime of forced labor defined by nonstop violence and strategic dehumanization, all cataloged methodically in sales receipts and ledgers. Around that \"peculiar institution,\" the thinkers of the time crafted an equally inhumane ideology to justify their brutality, using religious rhetoric in tandem with pseudoscience to rationalize treating humans as chattel. After the Civil War, the arrangements of legal slavery were replaced with those of organized, if not strictly legal, terror. Lynchings, disenfranchisement and indentured servitude all reinforced racial hierarchy from the period of Reconstruction through Jim Crow segregation and on until the movement for civil rights in the middle of the 20th century.\n\nThat's the ugly history most Americans know and acknowledge. But systemic racism also found its way, more insidiously, into the institutions many Americans revere and seek to safe-guard. Established in the 1930s, Social Security helped ensure a stable old age for most Americans, but it initially excluded domestic and agricultural workers, leaving behind two-thirds of black Americans. Federal mortgage lending programs helped white Americans buy homes after World War II, but black Americans suffered from a shameful catch-22. Federal policy said that the very presence of a black resident in a neighborhood reduced the value of the homes there, effectively prohibiting African-American residents from borrowing money to buy a home. And sentencing laws of the past several decades meant that poor black Americans were thrown in prison for decades-long terms for consuming one type of cocaine while their wealthier white counterparts got a slap on the wrist for consuming another.\n\nThere's a straight line between these policies and the state of black America today. The lack of Social Security kept black Americans toiling in old age or forced them to the streets. The obstruction of black homeownership, among other factors, has left African Americans poorer and more economically vulnerable, with the average black household worth $17,000 in 2016 while the average white household was worth 10 times that. \"Tough on crime\" sentencing policies have ballooned the black prison population, torn apart families and left millions of children to grow up in single-parent homes.\n\nThis systemic discrimination is also a matter of life and death, and police violence, which kills hundreds of African Americans every year, is just the start. Look no further than the coronavirus pandemic. The neighborhoods in which black Americans often find themselves confined by a legacy of discriminatory policy are rife with pollution and, in many cases, lack even basic options for nutritious food. This leaves residents more likely to suffer from health ailments like asthma and diabetes, both of which increase the chances of poor outcomes for those infected with COVID-19.\n\nTo actually capture all the ways in which the system is skewed against black people would require tome upon tome. But even a short list feels very long: black women are three to four times as likely as white women to die in childbirth, in part because of a lack of access to quality health care; black children are more likely to attend underresourced schools, thanks to a reliance on local property taxes for funding; black voters are four times as likely as white voters to report difficulties voting or engaging in politics than their white counterparts, in part because of laws that even today are designed to keep them for exercising their basic democratic rights; millions more have been disenfranchised because of felony convictions; hurricane flooding has been shown to hit black neighborhoods disproportionately.\n\nJeh Johnson, a lawyer who served as Obama's Homeland Security Secretary and was recently tapped to help New York state courts conduct a racial bias review, explained it flatly. \"Defined broadly enough, one could say that there's systemic racism across every institution in America,\" he told CNN recently.\n\nWith this in mind, it may come as little surprise that black Americans took to the streets in protest following the murder of George Floyd. Nearly 17% of African Americans are unemployed. When the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a surprise up-tick in jobs in May , the unemployment rate for African Americans in particular nevertheless remained on the rise. In the U.S., black Americans are dying from COVID-19 at twice the rate of their white counterparts. In some states, the disparity is even sharper.\n\nWhat's perhaps more surprising is that the rest of America is apparently waking up to these realities. For decades, the truth of systemic racism has always been swept under the rug, lest it make white Americans uncomfortable and hurt the electoral chances of those with the power to address it. In 1968, the Kerner Commission, initiated by President Lyndon Johnson to study unrest in American cities insisted that \"white society is deeply implicated in the ghetto. White institutions created it, white institutions maintain it, and white society condones it.\" The results of the Commission were largely ignored.\n\nDuring Barack Obama's first presidential campaign, many Americans were outraged when news broke that the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Obama's pastor, had uttered the words \"God damn America\" for \"killing innocent people,\" \"treating our citizens as less than human\" and failing \"the vast majority of her citizens of African descent.\" Obama condemned the comments and reminded the public that, actually, the U.S. had made great progress, even while acknowledging far more was needed.\n\nToday, the conversation is different, and one wonders whether such remarks, as salient now as they were then, would still be met with disavowal. The U.S. cannot deny what is plainly before its eyes. Shocking videos depict George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery murdered in broad daylight. Tens of thousands of black lives have been taken by the coronavirus. And, in the midst of all this, the President fans the flames of racial tensions with dog whistles so unsubtle that even the most skeptical can hear them.\n\nIn urban centers, black and white protesters have come forward together in defiance, joined by allies like GOP Senator Mitt Romney and longtime Koch Industries executive Mark Holden. In predominantly white cities across the country, white Americans have shown up by the thousands in solidarity. Even small towns in rural parts of the country have joined in the protests.\n\nA lot would need to change to address such deeply rooted bias. The first test may come this year as momentum grows in city halls, statehouses and Washington, D.C., for reforms to root out police brutality, perhaps the most flagrant and visible injustice. \"Justice for George is something that many people who were killed through brutality of the police never get,\" says Benjamin Crump, a civil rights lawyer representing Floyd's family. \"And that is a transformative justice, a systematic reform across the board.\"\n\nWhatever the progress transpires in the coming months, the U.S. still has a long way to go. Last year, I happened to find myself in both Berlin and Charleston, S.C. In Berlin, where Adolf Hitler planned and oversaw the extermination of millions of Jews, it felt as though I couldn't walk a few blocks without a memorial atoning for that sin. In Charleston, I fell asleep on a picturesque beach, only to learn later that the site was a key node in the Atlantic slave trade, where traders imported 40% of enslaved Africans who came to North America. I spent the rest of the day feeling sick to my stomach, disgusted at the possibility that I had enjoyed a leisurely nap where, perhaps, one of my ancestors endured one of the most gruesome of human institutions.\n\nAwakening can be painful. But in America, a reckoning is overdue.\n\nYour browser is out of date. Please update your browser at http://update.microsoft.com"

      "text": "Sometimes the toughest tests for a public uprising take place in private. The Black Lives Matter movement faced one such moment in October, inside a turreted building of pale stone planted on the site of the old Pennsylvania Avenue slave market, just blocks from the White House. Eleven young activists filed into a conference room, snapping selfies as they waited for one of the most powerful women in America. It takes clout to finagle a meeting with Hillary Clinton-and courage to do what came next.\n\nAll summer, Black Lives Matter protesters had disrupted campaign events and forced politicians to grapple with radioactive questions of race and justice. Clinton wanted to clear the air. But it was her guests who grabbed control. For 90 minutes, they peppered her with demands and pushed for sweeping investments in black communities. When the Democratic front runner said she couldn't muscle race-based legislation through Congress, they accused her of exhibiting white privilege. Alwiyah Shariff, an organizer with the Ohio Student Association, asked how Clinton could be trusted to keep a promise to close private prisons while collecting campaign contributions from the industry. Flashes of irritation flickered across the former Secretary of State's face. \"There was fire in her eyes,\" recalls Aurielle Marie, 21, an activist from Atlanta.\n\nThe confrontation turned out to be a catalyst. At a Democratic debate a few days later, Clinton denounced mass incarceration, called for body cameras on every cop and proposed a \"new New Deal\" for communities of color. \"Exactly the things we're advocating,\" says Sam Sinyangwe, a 25-year-old activist and data scientist who was present at the meeting. Within weeks, Clinton rolled out a criminal-justice platform ripped from the activists' playbook, including plans to curb police militarization and strengthen federal investigations in cases of alleged misconduct. Her campaign also announced that she would refuse donations from private-prison lobbyists.\n\nIn 2015, Black Lives Matter blossomed from a protest cry into a genuine political force. Groups that embraced the slogan hounded police chiefs from their jobs, won landmark prosecutions and turned college campuses into cauldrons of social ferment. At the University of Missouri, a hunger strike incited a boycott by the football team that drove the president out of office.\n\nAlong the way, an organic uprising morphed into organized blocs with specific demands. Activists arranged national conferences so local groups could connect and swap strategies. To skirt suspected surveillance by authorities, they learned to encrypt communication with smartphone apps like Signal and anonymized browsers like Tor. A movement rooted in the rejection of police violence diversified, launching campaigns to combat a broad sweep of perceived injustices, from gender inequality to the minimum wage to housing and education policy. The year 2014 was about \"connecting the dots for people and weaving a broader story about systemic injustice so the masses could understand life as a black person in America,\" says Brittany Packnett, a 31-year-old education executive from St. Louis whose role protesting the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., earned her a spot on President Obama's police-reform task force. \"In 2015, we know we can both tell the story and change the story.\"\n\nBlack Lives Matter began almost by accident. On July 13, 2013, George Zimmerman was acquitted in the killing of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager shot during a struggle in a gated Florida suburb. Alicia Garza, a workers'-rights activist, was nursing a drink at an Oakland, Calif., cocktail bar when the verdict came down. She dashed off a missive on Facebook, capped by a stirring sentiment: \"Black people. I love you. I love us. Our lives matter.\" Her friend Patrisse Cullors, a fellow California activist, was the one who added the hashtag.\n\nEven the people who coined the phrase didn't sense its force right away. Melina Abdullah, a California State University, Los Angeles professor and leader of a local Black Lives Matter chapter, recalls a meeting two days after Zimmerman's acquittal at Cullors' place in St. Elmo Village, a collective for black artists. Protests to memorialize Martin were popping up across the country, and the activists made banners inscribed with # j4tmla (justice for trayvon martin l.a.). Underneath, as if an afterthought, they scrawled # blacklivesmatter in tiny letters.\n\nThe Black Lives Matter network, founded by Garza, Cullors and New York-based immigration activist Opal Tometi, now counts nearly 30 official chapters, including an outpost in Canada. There is no legal entity, no 501(c)(3). Getting chartered simply requires a promise to uphold certain principles. The movement is also made up of countless other protest groups that emerged from the streets of Ferguson, with names like We the Protesters and Hands Up United. The prevalence of the Black Lives Matter hashtag prompted media outlets to seize the phrase as shorthand for the struggle writ large. The new civil rights movement had its rallying cry.\n\nNo matter their ideological differences, grassroots uprisings tend to follow patterns. Like the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter is anchored in the physical occupation of public space and amplified by social media. Each uprising was decentralized by design; insurrections against the misuse of power are leery of vesting too much of it in one place. But there are specific reasons Black Lives Matter has flourished where Occupy fizzled.\n\nOne is the way it has weaponized protest. Activists strategically shut down Chicago's Magnificent Mile on Black Friday and blocked traffic along Washington's I-395 on one of the busiest travel days of the year. The demonstrations were chosen to maximize impact: causing discomfort is designed to make society feel the pain and frustration of living as a black person in America.\n\nThen there's the phrase itself. As a slogan, \"Black Lives Matter\" is a piece of linguistic jujitsu, vague enough to seem inclusive yet charged enough to sow conflict. Even members of the movement squabbled over its meaning at first. In the wake of Michael Brown's death, some activists identified their mission as a battle to stop police violence, while others argued that that definition was too narrow. As the movement began to branch out from purely honoring the victims of police brutality to raising awareness about perceived injustice in all sorts of social systems, the name attracted new groups of allies. \"A single understanding of the movement,\" says St. Louis University law professor Justin Hansford, another of its local leaders, \"would ultimately exclude so many people.\"\n\nThe loose structure, as a confederation of local groups, empowers each one to set its own agenda. The Chicago chapter, for example, had a hand in the protests that ousted police superintendent Garry McCarthy in late November after video footage apparently revealed that the department had mischaracterized the events surrounding the shooting death of teenager Laquan McDonald. Windy City activists have also run campaigns against school closures, says Chicago organizer Aislinn Sol, as well as crusades to win reparations for victims of police torture. A prominent group of leaders launched a project called Campaign Zero, which focuses on shaping policy changes to police practices, as well as an offshoot that studies how police unions stifle efforts to hold cops accountable in cases of alleged misconduct. To gather raw data, DeRay Mckesson, a Campaign Zero co-founder and perhaps the movement's most prominent activist, filed Freedom of Information Act requests in the nation's 100 largest cities.\n\nIn places like the Bay Area, Black Lives Matter is part of the Fight for 15, a campaign to hike the minimum wage to $15 per hour. New York activists launched a Black Lives Matter super PAC. A group in Washington focuses on housing and gentrification. \"It's a national movement with very local goals,\" says Erika Totten, 33, a former English teacher from Alexandria, Va. \"It looks different in every city.\"\n\nthe diverse agenda is a reflection of its leadership. Black Lives Matter has a large number of influential LGBT activists. They and others have worked to make equality one of the movement's hallmarks. In August, Black Lives Matter organized rallies across the country to spotlight the murders of black transgender women. It's common to hear activists use the prefix cis -as in cisgender, which refers to anyone who's not trans-in sentences studded with terms like intersectional and microaggression.\n\nThe emphasis on gender, identity and social inequality helps explain why Black Lives Matter's agendas are spreading to college campuses. Back in March an anonymous user posted a YouTube clip that captured members of the University of Oklahoma's Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity singing a racist chant about barring black members. When it was dismissed as an isolated incident, activists created the hashtag # notjustSAE and encouraged students everywhere to share similar stories. Social media fueled protests again a few months later, when the violent arrest of Martese Johnson, a black University of Virginia honor student, was captured in another video clip that went viral.\n\nThe campus movement peaked in November at the University of Missouri, where a wave of protests launched by a group called Concerned Student 1950-after the year the school first admitted African Americans-swept out both the system president and the chancellor of its flagship campus. A few weeks earlier, a group of black students had decided to disrupt the school's homecoming parade by standing in its path and bellowing chants through a megaphone. During the ensuing fracas, a car carrying the system president, Tim Wolfe, allegedly nudged a graduate student named Jonathan Butler. Soon Butler launched a hunger strike, demanding that Wolfe resign for failing to address allegations of racism on campus. On Nov. 7, members of the football team announced that they would boycott team activities until Wolfe was gone. Within two days he was.\n\nA group called the Black Liberation Collective helped students at other schools make demands of their own. More than 70 colleges joined the protests, which became known as the Student Blackouts. \"It didn't come out of thin air,\" explains Zellie Imani, an activist and math teacher from Paterson, N.J., who helped convene conference calls and distribute templates so that student groups had the tools to petition administrators. \"Everything that happened was very coordinated and organized.\"\n\nThe protests racked up concessions at campuses across the country. Amid rolling sit-ins, Brandeis College administrators agreed to demands like increasing the recruitment of students of color. At Towson University, near Baltimore, demonstrators won new courses on race relations and tenure-track positions earmarked for black professors. Georgetown University agreed to rename two buildings named for former school presidents who sold slaves. Pushed by protesters, Princeton is weighing whether to strip the name of U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, one of its most famous alums, from its prestigious public-policy school because of Wilson's racist views.\n\nsuccess has created a new set of challenges and charges. Wesleyan University's student government slashed funding for the school newspaper after it published a column critical of Black Lives Matter. At Smith College, a group associated with Black Lives Matter barred members of the media from attending a protest unless they pledged solidarity. Activists at Amherst College unsuccessfully pressed the school's president to punish students who plastered All Lives Matter posters around campus. Free speech has sometimes seemed like a casualty in the battle for social justice.\n\nCritics have had other complaints. Republican presidential candidates said the movement spurs racial division, if not sheer lawlessness. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie told crowds that the movement's anti-police rhetoric has put lives at risk. \"They are calling for the murder of police officers,\" Christie incorrectly claimed. Even FBI Director James Comey gave credence to the idea that heightened scrutiny of police, driven by street demonstrations, might be partly responsible for the spike in violent crime in some cities. \"I do have a strong sense that some part of the explanation is a chill wind blowing through American law enforcement,\" Comey said in October. Black Lives Matter supporters dispute this theory, which proponents have dubbed the \"Ferguson effect.\"\n\nOpening the raw wounds of race has not made the protesters popular. Nearly 60% of respondents in a September PBS/Marist poll said race relations had gotten worse, not better, over the past year. But there's little sign such criticism will slow the movement's march. Clinton's overtures to Black Lives Matter have not won her a warmer reception; she was interrupted by Atlanta activists for 30 minutes during the Oct. 30 campaign event where she unveiled her criminal-justice platform. Despite its tactics of disruption (or perhaps because of it), Black Lives Matter is winning ever more access to candidates. The Democratic National Committee, which passed a resolution declaring its support for the movement, has invited activists to organize a presidential town hall as the race ramps up next year.\n\nIts perseverance this fall is a sign of the future. In mid-November demonstrators began gathering outside a Minneapolis police precinct to protest the shooting death of 24-year-old Jamar Clark. The city was a tinderbox, and Nekima Levy Pounds, president of the NAACP's Minneapolis chapter, worried about a spark. \"We're one incident away from becoming the next Ferguson,\" Pounds told officials. A few days before Thanksgiving, alleged white supremacists were charged with spraying bullets into a crowd of demonstrators, injuring five.\n\nBut peace reigned. The throngs reassembled as they had done day after day since Clark's death. Amid the bitter cold, the makeshift encampment became a kind of community, and each of the protesters found a role: bringing bread, sweeping the streets, stoking the fire pits. They held a concert and cooked a Thanksgiving dinner.\n\nAfter 18 days of round-the-clock protests, Minneapolis officials dismantled the encampment around 4 a.m. on Dec. 3. A crowd marched down to city hall. There they flooded the rotunda, filling the halls of power with the sounds of protest, as they promised to keep showing up, day after day, until they felt justice was done. - With reporting by Maya Rhodan and Sam Frizell\n\nYour browser is out of date.

      "text": "We Can't Solve the Climate Crisis Unless Black Lives Matter\n\nT he Black Lives Matter movement is not a distraction from saving the planet. We can't solve the climate crisis without people of color, but we could probably solve it without racists.\n\nWhether it's Hurricane Katrina or air pollution , storms and exposure to toxins cause much greater harm to communities of color. (Although, yes, in the longer term, climate change is coming for us all, even if you have a bunker in New Zealand.) So it follows that if we're thinking about how to become more resilient to the impacts of climate change, we must focus on the people who are actually the most impacted. And we must understand that it is people from their own communities who are best equipped to lead them.\n\nI simply don't see how we win at addressing the climate crisis without elevating Black, and Indigenous, and Latinx, and Asian leaders. Because it is not merely a technical challenge we are facing. It's not just about solar panels and electric cars. This is about how we implement solutions, how we replicate and scale them; it's about communities and governments and corporations changing the way they do things-solving the climate crisis is about everything. So we need to find ways that everyone can be a part of this transformation.\n\nIf climate organizations fail to prioritize welcoming people of color, the movement will never grow large enough to succeed. Furthermore, people of color are significantly more concerned about climate change than white people are (49% of whites, 57% of Blacks, 69% of Latinx). That's tens of millions of people of color in the U.S. who could be a major part of the solutions we need if unburdened by white supremacy.\n\nThe climate crisis requires that we build the biggest team possible. So wouldn't it make sense to prioritize the people who already get it?\n\nFor environmental groups, whether to consider justice is no longer a question; it is now expected. But there is an impulse to oversimplify and say climate justice is racial justice, to use an equal sign. While they are inseparably intertwined, they are also distinct, layered. In the wise words of feminist and civil rights activist Audre Lorde, \"There is no such thing as a single-issue struggle because we do not live single-issue lives.\"\n\nHow we address climate change will determine what the future holds for humanity. How do you deal with a crisis facing humanity without caring about the humans? Who are we saving the planet for?\n\nLet's include ever more expansive understandings of justice in environmental work. Let's integrate an understanding of interdependence. Let's take a holistic approach inspired by ecosystems. Let's value human diversity as much as we do biodiversity. Let's think about the world we want to live in, and how we can build it, together.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Why Protesters Want to Defund Police Departments\n\nW hen you talk to activists who are pushing to defund police departments, there's a specific word that comes up often: Reimagine .\n\nThe idea that police are the only answer to preventing crime and protecting people is one that has been so ingrained into American society that it can be hard to imagine a different reality. But amid a national uprising against police brutality and systemic racism, activists say it's time to reimagine what the public actually needs.\n\nIn the wake of George Floyd's death, proponents say it's time to defund police departments and put that money toward community programs, like after-school programs for students and housing assistance for disadvantaged communities. Among racial-justice activists, the idea isn't new: organizers, including in Minneapolis , had already been calling to defund the police for some time. But now the idea has been taken up by protesters across the country, who say efforts to reform police departments have been unsuccessful and it's time to curtail the role police play in society.\n\nThe U.S. spends more than $100 billion on policing per year. For many major cities, police department budgets make up a disproportionate amount of overall spending, even as other departments face steep cuts amid the coronavirus. Now, that spending is coming under scrutiny.\n\n\"People across the country are ready for a defunding framework,\" says Patrisse Cullors, co-founder of Black Lives Matter and founder of Reform LA Jails. \"We're ready to chip away at the line items inside of a police budget that really are nonsensical. Police should not be in charge of mental health crises. They should not be in charge of dealing with homelessness. They should not be in charge of 'supporting' people with drug dependency and addiction. Those are three line items which we can cut out of the police budget and then put that back into health care.\"\n\nAmong the national groups calling to defund the police are Black Lives Matter, which is currently collecting signatures for a petition calling for a national defunding of police. The Movement for Black Lives, a coalition of black organizations that includes Black Lives Matter, is also calling to defund the police, and during one day of action earlier this week encouraged people to press elected officials on the issue.\n\nThe rallying cry has spread across American cities. In Minneapolis, the demand has taken on new urgency: even city council members have gotten in on the calls to dismantle the police department and start over with a community-based approach. In New York City, there are growing cries from both activists and officials to cut the New York Police Department's $6 billion budget. In Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti announced up to $150 million could be cut from the police budget and redirected to investments in communities of color.\n\nMelina Abdullah, cofounder of Black Lives Matter LA, one of the organizations involved in the People's Budget LA coalition that seeks to defund the police, notes that the city's budget proposal increased funding for the police force at a time when other departments were seeing theirs slashed. \"We're in the midst of a health pandemic with an economic fallout. Why would you be spending more on police?\" says Abdullah, who points to schools and parks as places where police could be removed altogether.\n\nIn Washington, Mayor Muriel Bowser has painted a Black Lives Matter mural on streets near the White House and rechristened an intersection as Black Lives Matter Plaza. On Saturday, protesters painted \"Defund the Police\" next to the street mural, BuzzFeed News reported. Activists have been critical of the mayor's proposed cuts to programs like the Office of Neighborhood Safety and Engagement, which helps to address violence, noting she has proposed budget increases to the police department .\n\n\"From our perspective, all this is doing is further empowering the police to continue acts of terror against D.C.'s black communities and against its other poor, working and oppressed communities,\" says Sean Blackmon, an organizer with Stop Police Terror Project DC. \"What I think people realize is that a big part of impacting the police is getting right at what gives them their ability to do what they do, and a big part of that is just this gross amount of money and resources that they get.\"\n\nThe proposed restrictions vary by city. In Charlotte, city council member Braxton Winston has introduced a motion that would prohibit money from being spent on chemical agents used to disperse crowds and protesters, while creating a police oversight committee made up of the city council and city manager to review the department's spending. \"There's always been a political ability to make these changes,\" Winston says. \"It just seems that we may be in a moment where people that are in positions like mine are finally getting the political will.\"\n\nState officials are also hearing these demands. The Minnesota Legislature's People of Color and Indigenous Caucus suggested policy changes, including funding \"community-based intervenors and problem-solvers that can partner with local peace officers.\" And in Colorado, Democrats in the state senate introduced a police accountability proposal aimed at increasing transparency. But there are few if any specific proposals currently being proposed on the state level to defund the police; much of the energy is currently on the local and federal levels.\n\nCongress is under pressure to do something. One letter from more than 200 activists, elected officials, and other community leaders called on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer to defund the police, urging them to funnel money that a recent coronavirus-response bill allocated to law enforcement to other emergency response instead.\n\nDemocrats are expected to reveal a sweeping police reform bill next week aimed at tackling systemic racism. The New York Times reported that among the proposals currently included in a draft are banning chokeholds and tracking police misconduct with a national registry. It's unclear, however, whether the legislation will include anything that cuts federal funds.\n\nThe momentum around defunding the police is already becoming politicized. \"The Radical Left Democrats new theme is \"Defund the Police\". Remember that when you don't want Crime, especially against you and your family. This is where Sleepy Joe is being dragged by the socialists. I am the complete opposite, more money for Law Enforcement! #LAWANDORDER,\" tweeted President Donald Trump.\n\nWhile defunding the police has been in activists' lexicon for years, some are still surprised at the momentum it's gathered so quickly. \"For so long, police developed this monopoly over the idea of public safety, and so just mentioning anything around defunding police was seen as almost like blasphemy,\" says Philip McHarris, a researcher and PhD Candidate at Yale whose work focuses on race and policing. \"I think a part of it is we're in a moment we've never seen before.\"\n\nWrite to Lissandra Villa at lissandra.villa@time.com"

      "text": "Black Lives Matter: From social media post to global movement\n\nA slogan chanted by tens of thousands around the world, Black Lives Matter has sparked a hashtag, a network of grass-roots organisations, and a moral collective of activists.\n\nBut how did it go from a social media post to a global phenomenon, and where does it go now?\n\nThe names most associated with Black Lives Matter are not its leaders but the victims who have drawn attention to the massive issues of racism this country grapples with: George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Eric Garner, Michael Brown, to name a few.\n\nThe movement can be traced back to 2013, after the acquittal of George Zimmerman, who shot and killed Trayvon Martin in Florida.\n\nThe 17-year-old had been returning from a shop after buying sweets and iced tea.  Mr Zimmerman claimed the unarmed black teenager had looked suspicious.\n\nThere was outrage when he was found not guilty of murder, and a Facebook post entitled \"Black Lives Matter\" captured a mood and sparked action.\n\n\"Seven years ago, we were called together. There were about 30 of us standing in the courtyard of this black artist community in Los Angeles, summoned by Patrisse Cullors, one of our co-founders and one of my dearest friends,\" says Melina Abdullah, a professor of Pan African Studies in Los Angeles and co-founder of one of Black Lives Matters first \"chapters\".\n\n\"It was students ... artists, organisers and mommas. We knew that it was part of our sacred duty to step up. And there was an audaciousness that we could transform the world, but we didn't have a plan for it,\" she laughs.\n\nIf calls for justice for Trayvon Martin lit the spark for Black Lives Matter, it was the death of Michael Brown a year later that really brought the movement to national attention.\n\nThe unarmed teenager had been shot dead by an officer in Ferguson, Missouri and Black Lives Matter took to the streets, often in angry confrontation with the police.\n\nBut the killing of George Floyd took the movement to areas it had not reached before.\n\nThis moment of national reckoning gives Ambassador Andrew Young, a legendary civil rights leader, a \"tremendous sense of pride\".\n\n\"Especially that they have remained overwhelmingly nonviolent,\" the 88-year-old says.\n\nFor years he marched shoulder-to-shoulder with Rev Martin Luther King Jr, but very much as a civil rights leader in his own right.\n\nHe was later awarded the US Presidential Medal of Freedom and served as US Ambassador to the United Nations.\n\n\"Of course it was very different back then. We had to go door-to-door, church-to-church,\" he says.\n\n\"When Dr King went to jail, only 55 people showed up,\" Ambassador Young remembers.\n\nIn the 1960s, many of the key American civil rights figures were known the world over, but even someone as connected to the struggle for equality as Ambassador Young finds it hard to name contemporaries in the modern movement.\n\n\"Honestly, I don't know who Black Lives Matter is,\" he acknowledges.\n\n\"I don't know who the leaders are. In fact, I don't know that they even have any leaders.  I think perhaps it's a spiritual, emotional movement created by implicit evils in our society that we have not been willing to face.\"\n\nThose who have been involved with Black Lives Matter since its embryonic stages say this decentralized approach is intentional.\n\n\"Group-centred leadership is in our guiding principles,\" says Prof Abdullah.\n\n\"Leadership is not just about oratory, it's also about facilitation, planning, bringing arts to the movement, things that don't get as much recognition,\" she says.\n\nThe leadership in many Black Lives Matter chapters is also often female.\n\n\"Black women have always been at the heart of the black freedom struggle. Often times they have been painted over, and this time we are refusing to allow ourselves to be painted over,\" says Prof Abdullah.\n\nThe guiding light for this doctrine, and for Black Lives Matter as a whole, she says, has been Ella Baker - the feminist civil rights leader who championed collective grassroots activism over activism focused on a single leader.\n\n\"We all study Ella Baker as one of the most brilliant organisers to have ever walked the face of this earth. She was clear that movements should be bigger than individuals.\"\n\nThough Black Lives Matter has evolved into this loose national and international umbrella network, the Black Lives Matter Global Network is registered in the US as a non-profit organisation, one that is now getting grants and pledges from foundations and corporations falling over themselves to ally themselves with the movement.\n\nChapters of Black Lives Matter have spread across the US and around the globe, with massive protests in the UK, Europe, and Canada.\n\nThe movement now includes many of diverse backgrounds, who had previously not felt connected to the cause.\n\n\"I think a lot of people in our town suddenly felt as white people we need to be really critical of ourselves and understand our role in this,\" says AJ Crocker, one of the organisers of a Black Lives Matter vigil in in Norwood, Colorado, a mostly white town of about 500 people located about six hours drive from the nearest international airport.\n\nMs Crocker says the group is learning how they can combat racism in their own small community, such as campaigning for an official Spanish translator for the county.\n\nThey will also bring up Black Lives Matter as a discussion topic in the town council and are reading Ibram X Kendi's book \"How to be an Antiracist\" in the local book club.\n\n\"I actually really do appreciate that people are starting to educate themselves. There's a lot of literature out there that's pushing to educate our white counterparts on the issues that affect us and that's good,\" says Charles White, a keyboard player with Day Dream Sessions.\n\nThe band has been playing some of the songs that have become the soundtrack to the street demonstrations in Washington DC, including old protest anthems from Marvin Gaye and Sam Cooke.\n\nBut Mr White and his bandmates are also sceptical about what they sees as the mainstreaming of the movement.\n\n\"I feel like Black Lives Matter has become a trend,\" says drummer and bandleader David Mooney.\n\n\"At first it was about changing the situation at hand, but now you have all these corporations saying they support black people but they're just hoping to gain more customers and more money.\"\n\nAnd though some Black Lives Matter leaders deny it, over the years there has sometimes been a disconnect between the organisation itself and young black men, a constituency they are fighting for, the band says.\n\n\"I think the initial inception of Black Lives Matter is what we believed in and what we were marching behind,\" says trumpeter Eric Jackson.\n\n\"It was really about police brutality and the effects of that on black people. But I think now it's a multilayered thing with feminism and LGBTQ and all these different things kind of coupled into it. I think there needs to be a little bit of refocusing.\"\n\n\"But Black Lives Matter as a message is one I still stand behind,\" he insists.\n\nProf Abdullah though is proud of how the organisation has also been deliberately intersectional, with many women and LGBT activists at its heart.\n\n\"Black Lives Matter has been very clear that we are a womanist movement. And that doesn't mean that we exclude men, in fact there are lots of strong male leaders,\" she says.\n\nShe says the organisation is also just as concerned about tangible change, and that results are already being seen, albeit limited.\n\n\"Over the past six years, overall the number of killings at the hands of police has remained relatively stable, and that is not a good thing,\" says Prof Abdullah.\n\n\"However, what we are seeing is that in cities with strong Black Lives Matter chapters, the numbers have dropped dramatically, though this has been offset by increases elsewhere.\"\n\nShe says the gains have been achieved not by negotiating with police forces, which the organisation refuses to do, but by taking to the streets and making sure the police know they are being scrutinised.\n\nProf Abdullah says that Black Lives Matter is looking for much more, including the defunding and dismantling of the current police system in the US and its replacement with a new form of law enforcement, something for which it has received considerable criticism.\n\nBut while she says the organisation advocates one way of putting pressure on those in power, she is also supportive of chapters going their own way.\n\n\"One of the things that's really great is that we see new Black Lives Matter chapters, popping up all over the globe. They may not be official chapters, but people are stepping into their own calling.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Eva Artesona and Rakarrah Finley\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC. All rights reserved.

The video that surfaced showing the incident caused outrage. She survived, but so many do not.\n\nThere is much that connects Brazil to the US - guns, violence and these days their politics, too. But in the São Paulo favela of Americanópolis, people are hardly living the American dream.\n\nJoyce da Silva dos Santos shows me a video of her son Guilherme celebrating his birthday with a big cake and candles. He was a 15-year-old with his whole life ahead of him. He had dreams of following his grandfather into the bricklaying business, of one day buying a motorcycle, too. But his dreams were cut short.\n\nA few weeks ago, he disappeared outside his family's house. His body was found dumped on the outskirts of the city. One policeman has since been arrested. Another, an ex-policeman, is still on the run.\n\n\"Guilherme was so loving, he cared for everyone,\" Ms dos Santos tells me, hardly able to speak through her tears. She fears for her other children now. \"We don't know if when we leave home, we will come back - I don't have the will to live anymore.\"\n\nIn the street, the neighbours are enjoying a sunny Saturday afternoon, swigging beer and chatting. People here have come together since Guilherme's death, but so much has changed.\n\n\"The police should be protecting us,\" says a neighbour, also called Joyce, whose daughter was friends with Guilherme. \"They don't though, because of the colour of our skin.\"\n\nLast year police here killed nearly six times as many people as in the US and most of them were black.\n\n\"Police violence goes back to this complex way of accepting that some lives matter less than others,\" says Ilona Szabo, executive director of the Igarapé Institute, a security think tank based in Rio.\n\n\"The stereotype of the criminals, in general, is that they are black men. So when you are in a very violent society like Brazil, being faced with a black criminal, it might lead to the excessive use of force by the police, because that's the portrayal we accept. But I would say there is a part of society that supports this openly.\"\n\nBrazil has a long legacy of racism. It was the last country in the Americas to abolish slavery in 1888. More than four million people were brought over from Africa, more than to any other country in the world and that has left deep scars.\n\n\"The Brazilian state didn't create any kind of public policy to integrate black people in society,\" says author and activist Djamila Ribeiro. \"Although we didn't have a legal apartheid like the US or South Africa, society is very segregated - institutionally and structurally.\"\n\nFor a long time though, racism was not really talked about here. Brazilians were taught to believe that they lived in a racial democracy - where everybody got along without being discriminated against because of their colour. But, say activists, it is a myth.\n\n\"They love samba, love black culture and carnival, but they don't go on demonstrations against the genocide of black people,\" says Ms Ribeiro. \"They say it's not a racial issue, it's a class issue in Brazil.\"\n\nIt is what President Jair Bolsonaro still believes.\n\n\"Due to this myth that everyone is mixed, even black people in Brazil sometimes have difficulty seeing themselves as black,\" Ms Ribeiro explains. \"Here, it's not only about where you came from, it's the way you look - so if you look white, you will be treated as white, even if your parents are black.\"\n\nIt is, however, slowly changing.\n\n\"There's been an increase in awareness nationally,\" says Milton Barbosa, who founded the Unified Black Movement (MNU) in 1978 during Brazil's military rule. \"We still have to fight, but there have been important changes.\"\n\nOne of the movement's new generation of activists is 27-year-old Simone Nascimento. She was the first in her family to go to university and admits she is an example of progress. But the struggle continues and the pandemic complicates progress.\n\n\"Black people are dying from gunshots, from hunger and now from Covid,\" says Ms Nascimento. She says police feel emboldened, a feeling which is further strengthened by Jair Bolsonaro's talk of getting tough on crime and backing shoot-to-kill policies.\n\n\"As long as there's racism, there's no democracy - and fighting for democracy is fighting against the Bolsonaro government,\" she says. \"These are hard times.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Adama Traore: How George Floyd's death energised French protests\n\nIn the wake of the killing of George Floyd in the US last May, large protests erupted thousands of miles away in France.\n\nBlack Lives Matter banners aligned with France's own domestic movement organised under the slogan \"Justice for Adama\".\n\nAdama Traoré was a young black man who died in French police custody in 2016.\n\nTraoré, Amine Bentounsi, Remi Fraisse, Théo Luhaka, Cédric Chouviat. These are just some of the names of working-class victims of alleged police brutality in France, many of them black or Arab.\n\nThe movement dates back decades, with its earliest advocates from France's working-class suburbs, but there have also been more recent student protests in secondary schools. And the Gilets Jaunes movement - the yellow jersey protests against inequality - caused clashes with police that has led to growing concern in the mainstream over police tactics.\n\nIn the suburban town of Beaumont-sur-Oise, on the outskirts of Paris, Assa Traoré has become the symbolic figurehead of the movement in France, after her brother, Adama Traoré, died in police custody on his 24th birthday in 2016. No officers have yet been convicted.\n\nInstead, Assa herself has found herself in the dock, charged with defaming the names of the officers she claims were responsible for her brother's death. In a letter \"J'accuse\", inspired by Emile Zola's historic denunciation of anti-Semitism in the infamous Dreyfus affair, she chose to name them.\n\n\"In America, Derek Chauvin was imprisoned to send a clear message that we do not accept this murderous behaviour,\" she tells the BBC's Clive Myrie.\n\n\"Well in France, no, we are experiencing a repressive response from the legal system.\"\n\nThe justice system is siding with the police, she adds. \"It's shameful.\"\n\nThere is not footage of the death of Adama Traore, only the word of the officers present, against evidence the family and media organisations have reconstructed, a fact which has made prosecution in this case particularly complex. But activists against police brutality have for years relied on grainy phone footage to prove their allegations.\n\nShahin Hazamy, 25, calls himself a \"ghetto journalist\". He's from a working-class suburb and uses his Instagram to post videos of alleged police brutality which he and others from France's suburbs, have filmed on their phones. The images are shocking. Several show officers beating young men, seemingly without any provocation.\n\nOthers show the use of heavy handed force, neck holds and other controversial methods which have been linked to deaths in police custody. Shahin says his camera is his weapon: \"We use social media to protect ourselves, to show people, the wider French population, how the police act with young people from the French ghettos.\"\n\nHe says the images of George Floyd's death resonated deeply with his own experiences. \"Imagine if Floyd's death hasn't been recorded, none of this would have happened in France and the US, there wouldn't have been as much impact and justice wouldn't have come to pass.\"\n\n\"When I saw the video, I thought, that's exactly what we're living here in France. I can show you videos which are identical to the assassination of George Floyd, and they are happening in France.\"\n\nBut filming the police is set to get harder for young men like Shahin, with a new so-called global security law recently introduced. The bill initially sought to prohibit the filming of police officers, but even with amendments added that watered it down, human rights lawyer Arié Alimi says things will get tricky.\n\n\"The law hasn't changed when it comes to the right to film but it will change a lot on the streets, because people will be stopped a lot more when they get out their phones. The police are likely to believe that they can stop people who are filming them - journalists, citizens, especially when they are committing police violence or ethnic profiling.\"\n\nAccording to France's national ombudsman, young men of Arab and black African background are 20 times more likely to be randomly stopped by the police than the rest of the population, a statistic which Shahin says is rooted in institutional racism. He fears their only mode of defence - the phone - could soon be used against them.\n\nAlimi says that without evidence to support an allegation of police brutality, cases are virtually impossible to prosecute. He represents several of France's most high-profile cases of police brutality, including the so-called \"French George Floyd\".\n\nLast year, 42-year-old delivery driver Cédric Chouviat was filmed as he repeated \"I can't breath\" seven times, while being pinned down by three police officers, and still wearing his scooter helmet. He later died. Three officers have since been charged with manslaughter.\n\n\"Should I, an average black man, be worried walking the streets of France?\" Myrie asks Alimi.\n\n\"Yes, honestly, yes. You should worry about what could happen to you if you come across the police - there are even politicians, famous men and women, who are well known, who have been stopped and in some cases, experienced police violence in France.\"\n\nThe history of segregation in the US isn't the same as the history of colonisation in France, he says, but there is still a history of slavery, of colonisation, against Muslim populations.\n\n\"This history remains imbedded in the spirit of the policing institutions and means that you [Clive Myrie], when you walk in the street, you should be more worried than a white person.\"\n\nCedric Chouviat's family have called for the deadly chokehold, outlawed in many countries, and another technique also used on him, where a person is forced onto the ground face down while pressure is put on their upper body, to be banned. It was this latter technique which Assa Traore believes was responsible for her brother's death.\n\n\"By coincidence that day\" she says, \"the cameras in the police courtyard [where Adama's body was lying] were not working. But at my trial, an officer asserted that Adama wasn't even in the recovery position, confirming what the paramedics said. They left him to die like an animal.\"\n\nSo far the government has resisted reform, following pressure from police unions. This week, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin appeared alongside police officers protesting outside the National Assembly, demanding for tougher punishments against those who attack officers.\n\nHis presence has been deemed a controversial one given he is in charge of the police, but also in light of shocking revelations this week. An investigation by news outlet Mediapart revealed that police officers had fabricated evidence in a high-profile case in which four police officers were among several hurt in Viry-Châtillon in 2016.\n\nFrench police are among the most militarised in Europe - with deadly weaponry at their disposal, including LBD launchers known as \"flash-balls\" which have led to serious injury and even death, rubber coated bullets and grenades, which until last year contained TNT, a weapon banned everywhere else in Europe.\n\nMost recently, a new law now allows off-duty police officers to carry their firearms while off-duty including in theatres and shopping malls.\n\nWhile Floyd's death has in other parts of the world led to a reckoning with police violence and impunity, in France, new laws have so far increased police power.\n\nPolice trade unions say this is necessary given the tough conditions they face.\n\nJean-Christophe Couvy leads one of the biggest police unions, Unité SGP Police.\n\nHe recognises that the scaling back of community policing over several years has been a disaster, rupturing relations with those they're supposed to serve: \"This generation for us, actually is lost - we think we've lost a generation - but we want to fight for the next generation. This is a generation which is very violent, there is a lack of values, they need to be less violent, perhaps they need more education.\"\n\nHe denies racism within the police force, saying: \"if we have some racist policemen in France, they tarnish the rest of the police. For us, they need to get out. We are here for the people - black, white, Asian, Arabian\".\n\nAs part of this investigation, the BBC contacted Prime Minister Jean Castex and the interior minister but both declined to comment.\n\nActivists believe this is a pivotal moment for France, and her failure to stand up for its citizens could doom not just this generation, but also the next.\n\nPresident Macron's promise on taking office, of creating a new compact between the police and the public seems a distant memory. With the 2022 elections looming, security remains one of France's central concerns. But for those in working class neighbourhoods, the question is whose security is being prioritised.\n\nMyriam Francois is a journalist and writer based in Paris and London, and the host of the We Need to Talk about Whiteness podcast?\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron praised the \"courage\" of the teachers who restrained the attacker.\n\nHélène Perlant alleges that a priest at Notre-Dame de Bétharram beat her at a summer camp when she was 14.\n\nEurostar says the delays were caused by an \"overhead power issue\" with several trains between Paris or Brussels and London affected.\n\nThe man was near the roadside at the Val Thorens resort when he was swept 15 metres (50ft) in an avalanche, officials say.\n\nA Swiss ski resort is cut off and people have been told to stay indoors in the French resort of Tignes.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Adama Traore: How George Floyd's death energised French protests\n\nIn the wake of the killing of George Floyd in the US last May, large protests erupted thousands of miles away in France.\n\nBlack Lives Matter banners aligned with France's own domestic movement organised under the slogan \"Justice for Adama\".\n\nAdama Traoré was a young black man who died in French police custody in 2016.\n\nTraoré, Amine Bentounsi, Remi Fraisse, Théo Luhaka, Cédric Chouviat. These are just some of the names of working-class victims of alleged police brutality in France, many of them black or Arab.\n\nThe movement dates back decades, with its earliest advocates from France's working-class suburbs, but there have also been more recent student protests in secondary schools. And the Gilets Jaunes movement - the yellow jersey protests against inequality - caused clashes with police that has led to growing concern in the mainstream over police tactics.\n\nIn the suburban town of Beaumont-sur-Oise, on the outskirts of Paris, Assa Traoré has become the symbolic figurehead of the movement in France, after her brother, Adama Traoré, died in police custody on his 24th birthday in 2016. No officers have yet been convicted.\n\nInstead, Assa herself has found herself in the dock, charged with defaming the names of the officers she claims were responsible for her brother's death. In a letter \"J'accuse\", inspired by Emile Zola's historic denunciation of anti-Semitism in the infamous Dreyfus affair, she chose to name them.\n\n\"In America, Derek Chauvin was imprisoned to send a clear message that we do not accept this murderous behaviour,\" she tells the BBC's Clive Myrie.\n\n\"Well in France, no, we are experiencing a repressive response from the legal system.\"\n\nThe justice system is siding with the police, she adds. \"It's shameful.\"\n\nThere is not footage of the death of Adama Traore, only the word of the officers present, against evidence the family and media organisations have reconstructed, a fact which has made prosecution in this case particularly complex. But activists against police brutality have for years relied on grainy phone footage to prove their allegations.\n\nShahin Hazamy, 25, calls himself a \"ghetto journalist\". He's from a working-class suburb and uses his Instagram to post videos of alleged police brutality which he and others from France's suburbs, have filmed on their phones. The images are shocking. Several show officers beating young men, seemingly without any provocation.\n\nOthers show the use of heavy handed force, neck holds and other controversial methods which have been linked to deaths in police custody. Shahin says his camera is his weapon: \"We use social media to protect ourselves, to show people, the wider French population, how the police act with young people from the French ghettos.\"\n\nHe says the images of George Floyd's death resonated deeply with his own experiences. \"Imagine if Floyd's death hasn't been recorded, none of this would have happened in France and the US, there wouldn't have been as much impact and justice wouldn't have come to pass.\"\n\n\"When I saw the video, I thought, that's exactly what we're living here in France. I can show you videos which are identical to the assassination of George Floyd, and they are happening in France.\"\n\nBut filming the police is set to get harder for young men like Shahin, with a new so-called global security law recently introduced. The bill initially sought to prohibit the filming of police officers, but even with amendments added that watered it down, human rights lawyer Arié Alimi says things will get tricky.\n\n\"The law hasn't changed when it comes to the right to film but it will change a lot on the streets, because people will be stopped a lot more when they get out their phones. The police are likely to believe that they can stop people who are filming them - journalists, citizens, especially when they are committing police violence or ethnic profiling.\"\n\nAccording to France's national ombudsman, young men of Arab and black African background are 20 times more likely to be randomly stopped by the police than the rest of the population, a statistic which Shahin says is rooted in institutional racism. He fears their only mode of defence - the phone - could soon be used against them.\n\nAlimi says that without evidence to support an allegation of police brutality, cases are virtually impossible to prosecute. He represents several of France's most high-profile cases of police brutality, including the so-called \"French George Floyd\".\n\nLast year, 42-year-old delivery driver Cédric Chouviat was filmed as he repeated \"I can't breath\" seven times, while being pinned down by three police officers, and still wearing his scooter helmet. He later died. Three officers have since been charged with manslaughter.\n\n\"Should I, an average black man, be worried walking the streets of France?\" Myrie asks Alimi.\n\n\"Yes, honestly, yes. You should worry about what could happen to you if you come across the police - there are even politicians, famous men and women, who are well known, who have been stopped and in some cases, experienced police violence in France.\"\n\nThe history of segregation in the US isn't the same as the history of colonisation in France, he says, but there is still a history of slavery, of colonisation, against Muslim populations.\n\n\"This history remains imbedded in the spirit of the policing institutions and means that you [Clive Myrie], when you walk in the street, you should be more worried than a white person.\"\n\nCedric Chouviat's family have called for the deadly chokehold, outlawed in many countries, and another technique also used on him, where a person is forced onto the ground face down while pressure is put on their upper body, to be banned. It was this latter technique which Assa Traore believes was responsible for her brother's death.\n\n\"By coincidence that day\" she says, \"the cameras in the police courtyard [where Adama's body was lying] were not working. But at my trial, an officer asserted that Adama wasn't even in the recovery position, confirming what the paramedics said. They left him to die like an animal.\"\n\nSo far the government has resisted reform, following pressure from police unions. This week, Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin appeared alongside police officers protesting outside the National Assembly, demanding for tougher punishments against those who attack officers.\n\nHis presence has been deemed a controversial one given he is in charge of the police, but also in light of shocking revelations this week. An investigation by news outlet Mediapart revealed that police officers had fabricated evidence in a high-profile case in which four police officers were among several hurt in Viry-Châtillon in 2016.\n\nFrench police are among the most militarised in Europe - with deadly weaponry at their disposal, including LBD launchers known as \"flash-balls\" which have led to serious injury and even death, rubber coated bullets and grenades, which until last year contained TNT, a weapon banned everywhere else in Europe.\n\nMost recently, a new law now allows off-duty police officers to carry their firearms while off-duty including in theatres and shopping malls.\n\nWhile Floyd's death has in other parts of the world led to a reckoning with police violence and impunity, in France, new laws have so far increased police power.\n\nPolice trade unions say this is necessary given the tough conditions they face.\n\nJean-Christophe Couvy leads one of the biggest police unions, Unité SGP Police.\n\nHe recognises that the scaling back of community policing over several years has been a disaster, rupturing relations with those they're supposed to serve: \"This generation for us, actually is lost - we think we've lost a generation - but we want to fight for the next generation. This is a generation which is very violent, there is a lack of values, they need to be less violent, perhaps they need more education.\"\n\nHe denies racism within the police force, saying: \"if we have some racist policemen in France, they tarnish the rest of the police. For us, they need to get out. We are here for the people - black, white, Asian, Arabian\".\n\nAs part of this investigation, the BBC contacted Prime Minister Jean Castex and the interior minister but both declined to comment.\n\nActivists believe this is a pivotal moment for France, and her failure to stand up for its citizens could doom not just this generation, but also the next.\n\nPresident Macron's promise on taking office, of creating a new compact between the police and the public seems a distant memory. With the 2022 elections looming, security remains one of France's central concerns. But for those in working class neighbourhoods, the question is whose security is being prioritised.\n\nMyriam Francois is a journalist and writer based in Paris and London, and the host of the We Need to Talk about Whiteness podcast?\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron praised the \"courage\" of the teachers who restrained the attacker.\n\nHélène Perlant alleges that a priest at Notre-Dame de Bétharram beat her at a summer camp when she was 14.\n\nEurostar says the delays were caused by an \"overhead power issue\" with several trains between Paris or Brussels and London affected.\n\nThe man was near the roadside at the Val Thorens resort when he was swept 15 metres (50ft) in an avalanche, officials say.\n\nA Swiss ski resort is cut off and people have been told to stay indoors in the French resort of Tignes.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

The activist group isn't pleased with what has happened since the discussion, namely with proposals to give more funding to police departments.\n\n\"Leaders from Black Lives Matter met with White House officials earlier this year to discuss our policy agenda, and while we appreciate the chance to talk with them, we are surprised by their lack of progress on issues that matter to Black people, the same communities that so strongly supported Biden-Harris during last year's election,\" the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation told CNBC in an email Tuesday.\n\nIt's unclear when the meeting took place or which officials from both sides were at the gathering. Politico reported in May that BLM had yet to meet with the Biden White House. The Washington Post reported late last year that Patrisse Cullors, a co-founder of Black Lives Matter, wrote a letter to Biden and Kamala Harris about a potential meeting.\n\nBlack Lives Matter press representatives did return requests for additional comment. The White House did not return requests for comment.\n\nRep. Karen Bass, D-Calif., who is one of the lawmakers working on police reform, told NBC News that negotiations have hit some roadblocks due to infighting between law enforcement groups.\n\n\"I worry that it could prevent us from coming to a deal. And you know what I think it would be a really sad statement about the profession that they would actually prevent reforms and refuse to modernize,\" she said.\n\nThe meeting and its aftermath indicate that Black Lives Matter and the Biden team are headed for a standoff. It's also a sign that Black Lives Matter may not have as much influence in the Biden White House as the group had hoped.\n\nBlack Lives Matter, which was created after the 2013 acquittal of George Zimmerman in the killing of unarmed Black teenager Trayvon Martin, has been calling for a reduction in police spending . For years, the group has inspired and organized large protests against brutality toward Black people.\n\nLast year, the group and the Black Lives Matter motto surged in popularity and relevance following the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other Black Americans as protests erupted across the country.\n\nBiden won the 2020 election with the overwhelming support of Black voters.\n\nThe president recently said that states could take from $350 billion in stimulus funds in order to give a boost to police departments. Biden has also announced a slate of actions his administration are taking to curb the uptick in crime and gun violence.\n\nThis hasn't sat well with Black Lives Matter or activists calling for defunding police departments.\n\n\"And now we see the President arguing for increased spending on police rather than investing in housing, education, climate preparedness and healthcare,\" Black Lives Matter's statement to CNBC said. \"This is no time to return to the dangerous days of the tough-on-crime fear-mongering of the 1990s when more cops were placed in our neighborhoods, rather than services that improve lives and keep Black communities safe.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Op-ed: How the Black Lives Matter movement can avoid #MeToo's missteps to create lasting change\n\nFor the past few years, I've traveled the globe talking with male executives about how to close the gender gap. In the wake of the #MeToo movement, men who never considered sexism to be \"their\" issue were suddenly eager to become male allies, to help solve the problem.\n\nThere's a similar dynamic happening now, as white allies worldwide protest racism in the wake of the Minneapolis killing of George Floyd by a white police officer. Overwhelmingly white corporate America is loudly proclaiming its support for #BlackLivesMatter in ads and social media posts.  As with #MeToo, high-profile executives have lost their jobs- just in the past week, the editors in chief of the Philadelphia Inquirer, Bon Appetit, and Refinery29, and the CEO's of Crossfit and Ban.do.\n\nBut will that activism translate into meaningful action? Will it move beyond the posting black squares on Instagram or the shaming of a business leader?\n\nAs businesses grapple with the institutional racism built in to so many of our structures, history gives us some clues - and some warnings about what we may get wrong, yet again.\n\nConsider what's happened in the wake of the #MeToo movement. It's been almost three years since it became a global rallying cry, sparked by revelations about Harvey Weinstein and others. It broadened attention not just on sexual assault, but on the everyday indignities that women face:  being marginalized, overlooked, and underpaid. There were plenty of firings then too, and plenty of talk from executives and politicians. But actual impact? Not so much.\n\nSure, there have been some successes. Women in December made up more than half of the U.S. workforce. More companies are instituting family leave policies . Investment in diversity and inclusion programs has skyrocketed.\n\nYet true advances are incremental at best. The overall gender wage gap remains stuck at about 81% - and just 75% for black and Hispanic women. Women account for just 7.4% of Fortune 500 CEO's, even though they have made up the majority of college graduates for decades.\n\nCoronavirus quarantines have exposed systemic inequities at home, with women doing the majority of home schooling and housework , and the nation's 11 million single parents - most of them women - finding it impossible to care for children while juggling a job.\n\nThat lack of progress should ring loud warning bells for businesses that are now talking a great game about fighting racism. Ironically, those with the loudest megaphones often have the poorest track records.\n\nTech firms have been at the forefront of unconscious bias training, yet at Google , just 3.3% of employees are black, and at Facebook just 3.8%. Blacks are underrepresented across virtually every other industry as well; black men make up barely more than 3% of managers nationwide, and there are just four black Fortune 500 CEO's.\n\nThe pandemic has exacerbated the problem; while the overall unemployment rate in May declined to 13.3%, the overall black unemployment rate actually increased, to 16.8%.\n\nMore from Invest in You:\n\nMillennial women can't wait any longer to invest\n\nProtests point to America's racial wealth gap\n\nThis CEO is on a mission to help minorities land Wall Street jobs\n\nRacism and sexism are separate challenges, to be sure, with vastly different histories. Businesses alone aren't going to overturn centuries of structural racism. That said, there are ways to move the needle, to build diversity into leadership, culture and practices. There is a playbook for this. To avoid the all-talk-no-action pitfalls of the #MeToo movement, here are steps companies can take right now:\n\nExecutives often tell me that they want to bring more women and people of color into senior roles, but they simply can't find them. To them, I say: Look at your entry level. It doesn't take that long to grow junior staffers into senior leaders.\n\nOrganizations have gotten better at recruiting diverse workforces - but they're failed miserably when it comes to promoting and retaining them. A 2019 McKinsey & Co . study found that for every 100 men promoted to the first rung of management, only 72 women are promoted, a figure that is substantially worse for women of color. While one in five C-suite executives overall is female, only one in twenty-five is a woman of color.\n\nIf your organization is progressively less diverse at every level, the problem isn't with the employees - it's with the organization.\n\nIn football, the \"Rooney Rule\" requires a diverse slate of applicants for coaching jobs. More companies are adopting a similar approach in hiring, requiring a diverse pool of candidates. But that isn't enough. We all gravitate toward people who remind us of ourselves, and if the interviewers or hiring managers are white men, they are less likely to see the merits of women or people of color. The solution is straightforward: ensure that the interviewers are a diverse lot, not just for external openings but also for considering internal promotion candidates.\n\nIn the UK, companies are required to report gender wage gaps - leading to some truly horrifying and embarrassing statistics. In the U.S., few companies calculate wage gaps voluntarily, but for those that do, the impact can be profound. Salesforce assesses its wage gap by race and ethnicity as well as gender on an annual basis; it has spent more than $10 million since 2015 to correct inequities. Collecting the data on the wage gap by race and gender will go a long way toward pinpointing major problem areas.\n\nSymphony orchestras first popularized this practice, by having musicians audition behind a screen to mask gender and race - a change that transformed them from almost entirely male before the 1980s to almost equally gender balanced today. More companies have adopted the practice, too, by screening applicants with resumes scrubbed of identifying features like name, race, education and socioeconomic background.  Firms including Bloomberg, Dolby Laboratories, and BBC Digital have experimented with blind hiring - as has comedian Samantha Bee, who uses a blind application process to fill the writers' room for her show, \"Full Frontal with Samantha Bee.\"\n\nMost organizations set targets for revenue, profit, earnings per share, sales and multiple other metrics. But how about diversity and inclusion? Too many companies say they prioritize it, without quantifying what that means. Set goals for what that looks like for your organization, whether it's gender or racial mix, or sales to underserved customers. What gets counted, gets fixed.\n\nOther measures can get results too, like tying executive compensation to diversity goals, and instituting formal mentorship programs , which Harvard researcher Frank Dobbin has shown are more effective for people of color than informal mentorships. Creating a diverse workforce isn't just the right thing to do; it's a business imperative. Decades of research have proven the financial benefits of diversity in terms of revenue, investment returns , earnings, and return on equity .\n\nIt's way overdue for the white business community to join in the fight against racism. But talking about it isn't enough. It's time to act.\n\n-By Joanne Lipman, a CNBC contributor.

      "text": "How nonprofit Color of Change applies pressure to fight racial inequality\n\nAs protests against racial inequality continue, the nonprofit Color of Change is turning to major companies and police forces around the country to push for significant changes in policy, product and behavior.\n\nThe organization, a Black Lives Matter partner, has been waging their own war on racial inequality for over a decade, working as a change maker within the spheres of culture and media representation of Black people and experiences.\n\nColor of Change's latest fight is with Facebook , which has received pressure from hundreds of advertisers threatening to boycott the platform because of what the organization calls the company's failure to properly prevent the spread of hate speech and misinformation.\n\n\"About a thousand corporations have stood with this boycott. Many brands that no one would call social justice warriors are standing with social justice leaders in this moment because everyone recognizes the threat that Facebook provides if they are not reined in,\" said Rashad Robinson, president and executive director of Color of Change, in a recent interview on CNBC's \"Squawk Alley.\"\n\n\"Corporations do not want their ads and their brands showing up to white nationalist content and to have to hear Mark Zuckerberg talk about how he's not going to be held accountable.\"\n\nIn defense, Facebook tasked a group of auditors to evaluate its policies, leading to an independent review with disappointing results, according to numerous leaders in the civil rights space.\n\nThe audit zeroed in on Facebook's decision to leave up a post from President Donald Trump using the phrase \"when the looting starts, the shooting starts,\" in response to protests over the police killing of George Floyd, a Black man, on Memorial Day. Trump's post echoed a phrase used by a Miami police chief in the 1960s, widely interpreted as a violent threat against protesters.\n\n\"After the company publicly left up the looting and shooting post, more than five political and merchandise ads have run on Facebook sending the same dangerous message that 'looters' and 'Antifa terrorists' can or should be shot by armed citizens,\" the auditors wrote in an 89-page report .\n\nThe ad boycott campaign, led by Color of Change , has gained significant traction , with major brands like Unilever, Coca-Cola, and Starbucks pulling their ads from the social network. The issue has put Facebook in a precarious position and is likely to come up on July 27 when CEO Mark Zuckerberg is expected to testify before the House Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee.\n\nFacebook isn't the only company feeling the heat. Color of Change, founded in 2005, is rattling large TV and streaming companies like Netflix and Fox.\n\nAlready, Color of Change has shaken up legacy media outlets. The group rallied for the cancellation of \"Cops\" in 2013 from Fox, one of the network's leading shows for 25 years up until that point. The show then was picked up by the Paramount Network. But last month the television channel announced it would cancel the show amid protests against police brutality in the wake of Floyd's death.\n\nFor years, Color of Change has argued that the show glorified police officers and unfairly portrayed low-income people as villains. To paint \"the poor people who have been already targeted and attacked doesn't serve us,\" said Robinson in an interview with CNBC.\n\nA similar battle is brewing. Up next for Color of Change is an effort to replicate their experience with \"Cops,\" shifting their focus to other shows that also depict police officers in a flattering light without considering the practices they disproportionately inflict on people of color.\n\n\"We are really focused on reality cop shows, which set up a relationship with police where they're only going to be shown in positive lights and sets up a world that is not actually accurate and only really targets and shows certain types of communities,\" Robinson said.\n\nEarlier this year, the organization put together a report, called \"Normalizing Injustice,\" which outlines practices producers and industry executives can follow to make crime television shows more realistic.\n\nThe report found that crime TV as a genre \"plays a considerable role in advancing distorted representations of crime, justice, race and gender in media and culture,\" according to the press release. \"These fictitious depictions build on false perceptions of the criminal justice system and how it intersects with race and gender while ignoring many important realities.\"\n\nCrime TV also has among the least diverse crews of showrunners and writers, the report found. More than 81% of showrunners of 26 shows studied are white men, and 20 out of 26 shows either have no Black writers or just one Black writer, according to the study.\n\nBecause much of their recent work is focused on the relationship between law enforcement and people of color, Robinson maintains that the organization's relationship with the police is complicated.\n\nMany forces around the country have welcomed discourse with Color of Change on the topics of police brutality and its disproportionate impact on people of color, Robinson told CNBC.\n\nThe police \"is not a monolith,\" he said. \"I've actually had very good conversations with police chiefs. And it doesn't mean that we always agree. It just means that we are having conversations and I feel like there is a sharing of perspectives.\"\n\nOne law enforcement body, the Fraternal Order of Police, has never been receptive to such a conversation, Robinson said. \"They want more militarized policing and they want more control over our communities and have failed in their fundamental responsibility to keep us safe time and time again,\" Robinson said of the group, which is made up of over 330,000 sworn law enforcement officers nationwide.\n\nRobinson recalled a surprising meeting at the White House in 2016 after the deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile when former President Barack Obama was in office. During this meeting, Robinson was discussing racial profiling, sharing his own experience of being stopped and frisked while walking through Central Park. Also present was Bryan Stevenson, the lawyer who successfully appealed the murder conviction of Walter McMillian and wrote the book \"Just Mercy,\" which became a movie starring Michael B. Jordan and Jamie Foxx.\n\nAs the two spoke, \"the head of the Fraternal Order of Police interrupts me and says all of this talk of racial profiling is new to me,\" Robinson said. In the meeting with heavyweight civil rights leaders Robinson and Stevenson, as well as \"a roomful of other activists,\" the FOP head felt \"completely comfortable with not saying, 'I don't agree,'\" Robinson said. \"He didn't say, 'I don't agree with your demands.' He didn't say, 'I think you guys are overstating the problem.' He gas-lit us to basically believe that the problem doesn't exist.\"\n\nRobinson conceded that afterwards he heard from other police chiefs who had also been in the room when the exchange went down. They reached out to talk about what they heard, a bit of encouragement for Robinson that came out of what had become a sour meeting.\n\nAnd despite having many forces open to hearing from them, the nature of their work \"makes it so that we are not a fan favorite of the police,\" Robinson said.\n\nThe Fraternal Order of Police didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe silver lining is that police forces are generally under local jurisdiction, meaning that Color of Change can go from state to state talking with governors and local leaders about police reform.\n\nIt also means that external influences like the Fraternal Order of Police and the White House do not have the power to command the police or stop reforms from happening.\n\nSince President Donald Trump entered office, Color of Change has not engaged the White House and there are no plans to do so in the near future, Robinson said.\n\n\"You can't engage an institution that doesn't want to be engaged and doesn't believe in engagement,\" he explained.\n\n\"And this is a White House that thinks that there were 'fine people' on the other side of Charlottesville,\" he said, referring to the protests and clashes of 2017 in the Virginia city. \"This is a grifter White House that uses issues to stoke resentment, to stoke attention, but doesn't actually want to solve problems. And it's all a reality show. And so, you know, we are trying to deal with serious issues here and trying to advance serious causes. \"\n\nSo much of the work happens on the ground, so Color of Change doesn't need the White House's cooperation or approval to keep their operations going.\n\nBut if former Vice President Joe Biden wins the presidency come November, Color of Change will \"absolutely\" engage the White House, Robinson said, adding that it's not a partisan issue because the group has worked with Republican lawmakers to fight for small Black-owned businesses.\n\nInstead, the issue is with Trump himself, he said.\n\n\"This is a president that has supported, engaged and uplifted white nationalists,\" Robinson said. \"We wouldn't know where to start, and going hat in hand to a person who time and time again has proven themselves to not be a stable force for change would be a mistake.\"\n\nThe White House didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThese efforts have widened Color of Change's reach, leading to a ramp-up in fundraising and membership. The organization has quadrupled its membership count from 1.7 million to 7 million people in the last few weeks, Robinson said.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times , Robinson said that Color of Change has received \"hundreds of thousands of individual donations\" in the last few weeks.\n\n\"More folks have reached out wanting to support our work as they become aware of who we are,\" Robinson told CNBC. \"And we think it's a rallying cry for us to grow our reach and deepen our efforts.\"\n\nColor of Change has a policy against taking direct financial contributions from corporations, but corporate donations have been flooding in as the waves of protests continue nationwide. The group's board has plans to redistribute those donations to various black-led organizations, the Times reported.\n\nBecause Color of Change doesn't accept corporate donations, \"we are really continuing to rely on the support of individuals and foundations all around the country who believe in racial justice and believe that we need strong organizations to achieve it,\" Robinson said.\n\nThe process begins with open conversation. To communicate with these large companies in an effort to get closer to a society where racial justice does exist, Color of Change tries to engage first before applying pressure in the form of a campaign.\n\n\"We try to really understand what the arguments are on the other side,\" Robinson said. But if initial discussions don't seem pointed toward progress or understanding, Color of Change can use its vast backing to press these companies to reconsider.\n\nThere's no one strategy that fits every company. For Facebook, the ad boycott campaign has put the social media giant on the defensive as it loses millions of dollars in advertising money.\n\nFor each company and institution, Color of Change looks at gaps it can strategically use to navigate their concerns. \"If a network relies on advertisers, there may be a space\" to apply pressure, Robinson said.\n\nAnd while some campaigns are more visually obvious than others - like targeting shows readily available on Netflix or daytime television - more frequently, it's the employees of a company who sound the alarms and invite Color of Change to get involved.\n\n\"Lots of times, employees of these companies are raising the same concerns we are on the outside, and oftentimes don't have the same level of power to speak up on the inside, particularly black employees and employees who see who see themselves as allies of black folks,\" Robinson said.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Trump cranks up attacks on the Black Lives Matter movement for racial justice\n\nWASHINGTON - President Donald Trump on Thursday launched his most direct attacks to date on the nationwide Black Lives Matter movement for racial justice.\n\nTrump, seizing on a quote by a man who runs a fringe Black Lives Matter knock-off group, and a chant that is not popular with protesters, suggested in tweets that the loosely organized racial justice movement poses a threat.\n\nTRUMP TWEET\n\nTrump was quoting Walter \"Hawk\" Newsome, who was a guest on Fox News earlier in the day. In the same interview, Newsome also said that BLM activists should be applauded for arming themselves with guns, and he said his threat to \"burn down this system\" could be either figurative or literal, depending upon one's viewpoint.\n\nIn his tweet, Trump falsely described Newsome as a \"Black Lives Matter leader.\" But in reality, Newsome has repeatedly angered the founders of the official Black Lives Matter movement by adopting their moniker and raising money off of it, while espousing an approach to racial justice that is far more militant than the main branch of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nReached for comment about Newsome's Fox News interview, a BLM spokesperson told CNBC, \"As BLM has told Mr. Newsome in the past, and as is still true today, Mr. Newsome's group is not a chapter of BLM and has not entered into any agreement with BLM agreeing to adhere to BLM's core principles.\"\n\nCNBC reached out to the White House to ask if the president was aware that Newsome was not actually a \"Black Lives Matter leader,\" but a spokesman did not respond to questions.\n\nExactly one minute after Trump tweeted out Newsome's quote, he posted another tweet about BLM.\n\nThis time, Trump railed at New York Mayor Bill De Blasio's recently announced decision to paint a \"Black Lives Matter\" mural on Fifth Avenue in front of one of Trump Tower, the site of Trump's former residence. It is one of five such murals being painted throughout the city.\n\nTRUMP TWEET\n\nTrump claims in the tweet that a chant about killing police is \"their chant,\" referring to the Black Lives Matter movement. But that chant has not been popular with protesters in New York or anywhere else in the country in the wake of George Floyd's killing in late May in Minneapolis.\n\nFive minutes after the mural tweet, Trump tweeted, \"LAW AND ORDER!\" one of his most oft-repeated phrases ever since the start of the nationwide movement for racial justice that was triggered by Floyd's death.\n\nThe tweets come near the end of a week during which the president, trailing badly behind Democrat Joe Biden in presidential polls, has repeatedly sought to sow fresh racial divisions among Americans.\n\nIn the past seven days, Trump has deployed a racist nickname for the deadly coronavirus , demanded that a toppled Confederate statue in Washington be restored, tweeted context-free videos of black people attacking white people, tweeted a doctored video purportedly showing a \"racist baby,\" and accused former President Barack Obama of \"treason.\"\n\nBy cranking up the same culture wars that helped Trump to win the White House in 2016, the president hopes to galvanize his core supporters, and to drive a wedge between suburban middle-class White voters and the activists protesting in cities across the nation.\n\nYet polls increasingly show that Trump's strategy is backfiring. Instead of siding with Trump against the protests, some of which have turned violent, a majority of Americans say the country's leaders should focus on the underlying reasons for the protests, and not on cracking down on protesters, even ones who break the law.\n\nA New York Times/Siena College poll released this week found that 63% of registered voters said they would rather back a presidential candidate \"who focuses on the cause of protests, even when the protests go too far.\" Only 31% said they would prefer to support a candidate \"who says we need to be tough on demonstrations that go too far.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

The customer, whose name was blurred, wrote \"ALL LIVES MATTER!\"\n\nCritics of the Black Lives Matter movement often seek to counter the phrase by saying \"all lives matter\" or \"blue lives matter,\" referencing fallen police officers.\n\n\"I have to disagree with you,\" Bezos replied.\n\n\"'Black Lives Matter' doesn't mean other lives don't matter. Black lives matter speaks to racism and the disproportionate risk that Black people face in our law enforcement and justice system.\"\n\nUnlike black parents, Bezos said, he will never have to worry that his son \"might be choked to death while being detained one day.\" He added that he supports the recent protests around police brutality.\n\n\"I want you to know I support this movement that we see happening all around us and my stance won't change,\" he added.\n\nIn recent days, protests have erupted nationwide over the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, at the hands of Minneapolis police. On Wednesday, three former Minneapolis police officers were charged with aiding and abetting murder in connection with the killing of Floyd. Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer who was filmed kneeling on Floyd's neck before he died, was also charged with second-degree murder, after he was initially charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.\n\nMany companies have spoken out against Floyd's killing and police brutality, including Amazon. On Wednesday, Amazon announced it would donate $10 million to social justice organizations. The company also tweeted that the \"inequitable and brutal treatment of Black people\" must stop.\n\nAt the same time, organizations have criticized the company for its ties with police and development of facial recognition technology. Over 1,000 police departments across the U.S. have partnerships with Ring, the smart doorbell security owned by Amazon. Additionally, human rights groups have called for the ban of Amazon's facial recognition technology, Rekogntion, which they argue poses a threat to immigrants and religious minorities.\n\nWATCH: Protests against police brutality spread beyond the U.S.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

Cynthia Perry, a senior manager who worked on design research, said in the resignation letter she posted on LinkedIn that she had \"been gaslit, manipulated, bullied, neglected and mostly unsupported\" as a Salesforce employee.\n\nVivianne Castillo, who had been a manager for design research and innovation, posted her resignation letter on LinkedIn as well, saying she was regularly asked to help with internal diversity, equity and inclusion efforts for free on top of her work.\n\nCastillo alluded to miners sending canaries into coal mines to check for safety risks before going in. \"I've grown tired of watching the canaries of underrepresented minorities leave Salesforce, only to watch Salesforce ramp up their efforts to throw more canaries into the culture that caused the previous ones to leave or worse -- suffer in silence.\"\n\nIn July, following protests of the killing of George Floyd while in police custody, Salesforce said it hoped to increase the number of Black employees in the U.S. by 50% by the end of 2023.\n\nOther companies also want to hire more Black workers, although not every effort is a smash hit. CNBC reported last month on issues that Black college students encountered while going through Google's Howard West program, including discriminatory treatment from Google employees, with fewer participants than planned.\n\nAfter Salesforce's LinkedIn account published the message on Friday, hundreds reacted with emojis such as the thumbs up and heart, and some users left comments.\n\n\"Ohanaaaaa,\" one Salesforce employee wrote, using the Hawaiian word for family, which Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff regularly uses. \"Yessss! You're part of ours,\" the Salesforce account wrote in reply. (In 2018, Bloomberg reported that some Salesforce employees had expressed that the company had misappropriated Hawaiian words and culture.)\n\n\"Language,\" another Salesforce employee wrote in response to the original post.\n\n\"I'm Salesforce, b----,\" the company account replied.\n\n\"You are not,\" the employee wrote back. \"Your language demonstrates this.\"\n\nThe Salesforce account on Friday also posted a separate post showing support for transgender people.\n\n\"SALESFORCE wants you to know that TRANS lives matter!\" said the message, which was also deleted shortly after it had appeared online.\n\n-- Salvador Rodriguez contributed to this report.\n\nWATCH: Salesforce CEO talks plans to allow employees to work from anywhere\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Philadelphia mayor blasts double standard in policing of Black and White protesters\n\nPhiladelphia Mayor Jim Kenney, reacting to the violence on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, drew a stark contrast between how government and police respond to demonstrations held by Black protesters and White protesters.\n\nKenney, appearing Thursday on CNBC's \" Squawk Box ,\" said the months of protests last year that sprang from the police killings of unarmed Black people did not receive the same \"tenor or flavor\" of response as the mostly white pro-Trump rioters who stormed the Capitol on Wednesday as lawmakers worked to confirm the Electoral College results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\"Could you imagine thousands of Black people, people of color, invading the Capitol - what would have happened to them yesterday?\" the Democrat, who is White, asked.\n\nThe death of George Floyd, a Black father who was killed last spring as a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck while making an arrest, sparked mostly peaceful protests in cities across the country, including Philadelphia and Washington, through 2020. Those demonstrations against police brutality often included standoffs with riot police, the presence of U.S. National Guard members and counter-protesters. Some did result in violence and looting.\n\nIn one incident in June, armed members of the D.C. National Guard wearing camouflage were staged at the Lincoln Memorial during a peaceful protest against police brutality.\n\nThat same day, police and National Guard troops forcefully dispersed peaceful protesters at Black Lives Matter Plaza near the White House to make way for Trump to hold a Bible for a photo op at St. John's Church.\n\nMany politicians and media personalities are speaking out on the divergent use of law enforcement in the Capitol protest and the Black Lives Matter rallies that took place last year. MSNBC's Joy Reid also compared it to rallies against police brutality held in the last decade in cities including Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore.\n\n\"White Americans are never afraid of the cops, even when they are committing insurrection, even when they are engaged in attempting to occupy our Capitol to steal the votes of people who look like me, because in their mind, they own this Capitol; they own the cops,\" said Reid, who is Black. She hosts the weekday show \"The ReidOut.\"\n\n\"I guarantee if that was a Black Lives Matter protest, there would be people shackled, arrested or dead,\" she added.\n\nFour people lost their lives during the incident in Washington, including a woman fatally shot by Capitol police. Almost 68 people connected to the chaos were arrested, according to D.C. police. Capitol police say 14 people were arrested, primarily for unlawful entry. Buildings were placed on lockdown and lawmakers evacuated as participants clashed with police, roamed the federal campus, destroyed property and occupied congressional chambers and offices.\n\nSome wielded Confederate flags.\n\nRioters had already occupied the Capitol building, delaying the electoral count for hours, before D.C. National Guard was sent to help secure the campus.\n\n\"Some of these law enforcement folks were taking selfies with them,\" Kenney said. \"How did they get through bicycle barricades?\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump instigated the events of the day during his Save America rally near the White House, where he urged supporters to head to the Capitol to protest the vote certification in Congress, which was led by Vice President Mike Pence.\n\nTrump has made baseless claims of widespread voter fraud since losing reelection to President-elect Joe Biden in November and has instructed his ardent followers not to accept the vote results.\n\nThe president has claimed without proof that Philadelphia, a city of more than 1.5 million that is about 44% Black and 45% white, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, was one of multiple swing-state cities with large Black populations that rigged the election against him.\n\nThe city voted overwhelmingly for Biden, helping him win Pennsylvania's 20 electoral votes. Trump had flipped the state red in the 2016 election cycle.\n\nIn Washington on Wednesday, unarmed National Guard members were initially deployed to assist in directing traffic and supporting local police with crowd control.\n\nKenney recalled that the Democratic and Republican national conventions, which were held in the city in 2016 and 2020, respectively, had better security than was deployed in Washington, even though officials had time to prepare for the demonstrations.\n\n\"We had barriers that you couldn't get over, you know, with a pole vault if you tried, and there were heavy-duty, heavy-gauged barriers that kept people away from the Wells Fargo Center because of the event,\" Kenney said of the two conventions.\n\nHe highlighted how pro-Trump rioters breached the Capitol by jumping over barriers, walking up the steps and walking into the building armed.\n\n\"I think that's much worse for the country,\" he said.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Lockdown-focused Facebook groups pivot to attacks on Black Lives Matter\n\nIn this article\n\nA loose network of Facebook groups that took root across the country in April to organize protests over coronavirus stay-at-home orders has become a hub of misinformation and conspiracy theories that have pivoted to a variety of new targets. Their latest: Black Lives Matter and the nationwide protests of racial injustice.\n\nThese groups, which now boast a collective audience of more than 1 million members, are still thriving after most states started lifting virus restrictions.\n\nAnd many have expanded their focus.\n\nOne group transformed itself last month from \"Reopen California\" to \"California Patriots Pro Law & Order,\" with recent posts mocking Black Lives Matter or changing the slogan to \"White Lives Matter.\" Members have used profane slurs to refer to Black people and protesters, calling them \"animals,\" \"racist\" and \"thugs\" - a direct violation of Facebook's hate speech standards.\n\nOthers have become gathering grounds for promoting conspiracy theories about the protests, suggesting protesters were paid to go to demonstrations and that even the death of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man who died in the custody of Minneapolis police, was staged.\n\nAn Associated Press review of the most recent posts in 40 of these Facebook groups - most of which were launched by conservative groups or pro-gun activists - found the conversations largely shifted last month to attacking the nationwide protests over the killing of Black men and women after Floyd's death.\n\nFacebook users in some of these groups post hundreds of times a day in threads often seen by members only and shielded from public view.\n\n\"Unless Facebook is actively looking for disinformation in those spaces, they will go unnoticed for a long time and they will grow,\" said Joan Donovan, the research director at the Harvard Kennedy School's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics, and Public Policy. \"Over time, people will drag other people into them and they will continue to organize.\"\n\nFacebook said it is aware of the collection of reopen groups, and is using technology as well as relying on users to identify problematic posts. The company has vowed in the past to look for material that violates its rules in private groups as well as in public places on its site. But the platform has not always been able to deliver on that promise.\n\nShortly after the groups were formed, they were rife with coronavirus misinformation and conspiracy theories, including assertions that masks are \"useless,\" the U.S. government intends to forcibly vaccinate people and that Covid-19 is a hoax intended to hurt President Donald Trump's re-election chances this fall.\n\nPosts in these private groups are less likely to be scrutinized by Facebook or its independent fact-checkers, said Donovan. Facebook enlists media outlets around the world, including The Associated Press, to fact check claims on its site. Members in these private groups have created an echo chamber and tend to agree with the posts, so are therefore less likely to flag them for Facebook or fact-checkers to review, Donovan added.\n\nAt least one Facebook group, ReOpen PA, asked its 105,000 members to keep the conversation focused on reopening businesses and schools in Pennsylvania, and implemented rules to forbid posts about the racial justice protests as well as conspiracy theories about the efficacy of masks.\n\nBut most others have not moderated their pages as closely.\n\nFor example, some groups in New Jersey, Texas and Ohio have labeled systemic racism a hoax. A member of the California Facebook group posted a widely debunked flyer that says \"White men, women and children, you are the enemy,\" which was falsely attributed to Black Lives Matter. Another falsely claimed that a Black man was brandishing a gun outside the St. Louis mansion where a white couple confronted protesters with firearms. Dozens of users in several of the groups have pushed an unsubstantiated theory that liberal billionaire George Soros is paying crowds to attend racial justice protests.\n\nFacebook members in two groups - Wisconsinites Against Excessive Quarantine and Ohioans Against Excessive Quarantine - also regularly refer to protesters as \"animals,\" \"thugs,\" or \"paid\" looters.\n\nIn the Ohio group, one user wrote on May 31: \"The focus is shifted from the voice of free people rising up against tyranny ... to lawless thugs from a well known racist group causing violence and upheaval of lives.\"\n\nThose two pages are part of a network of groups in Ohio, Wisconsin, Minnesota, New York and Pennsylvania created by conservative activist Ben Dorr, who has for years raised money to lobby on hot-button conservative issues like abortion or gun rights. Their latest cause - pushing for governors to reopen their states - has attracted hundreds of thousands of followers in the private Facebook groups they launched.\n\nPrivate groups that balloon to that size, with little oversight, are like \"creepy basements\" where extremist views and misinformation can lurk, said disinformation researcher Nina Jankowicz, a fellow at the nonpartisan Wilson Center, a Washington, D.C., think tank.\n\n\"It's sort of a way that the platforms are enabling some of the worst actors to stay on it,\" said Jankowicz. \"Rather than being de-platformed - they can organize.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Morgan Stanley's Harris says Black Lives Matter has helped sparked interest in diverse companies\n\nIn this article\n\nCarla Harris, Morgan Stanley's vice chair of Global Wealth Management, said Wednesday that the acceleration of the Black Lives Matter movement has come in tandem with an uptick in investing interest in diverse and female-led companies.\n\nHarris, who spoke via video call at the annual Delivering Alpha conference presented by CNBC and Institutional Investor, added that investors in the modern era no longer have an excuse for being unable to find investments that prioritize a diverse c-suite and workforce.\n\n\"Especially since the Black Lives Matter movement has accelerated, more of the [venture capitalists] that that we talked to last year are now saying that they are actively looking for investment opportunities with multicultural and female entrepreneurs,\" Harris said.\n\nThe Morgan Stanley executive added that it's also important for an investor considering a stake in a diverse company to themselves have multicultural colleagues.\n\n\"I'll tell you some of the suggestions that we made in our last white paper that they actually have embraced,\" she continued. \"They're things like making sure that you give feedback when you have an entrepreneur who comes to you and you decide not to invest: Give them the feedback on what they can do to enhance and maybe come back and get another bite at the apple.\"\n\n\"Expanding your network, showing up at the conferences and the convenings where these entrepreneurs are trafficking,\" Harris said. \"More importantly, make sure that you have a multicultural partner at the table because that obviously gives you an opportunity to access to a network that you may not have.\"\n\nHarris, one of Wall Street's most powerful women, was joined on the panel by Kewsong Lee, the chief executive of The Carlyle Group.\n\nAs one of the globe's largest and most-recognized private equity firms, Carlyle has for years stressed diversity among the companies it works with, Lee said.\n\n\"Companies that are more diverse in our portfolio grow 12% faster than companies that are less diverse,\" Lee told CNBC's Sharon Epperson. \"That's just proof that it shows up in better performance if we can drive better performance.\"\n\n\"It absolutely helps drive performance,\" he added.\n\nThe comments from Harris and Lee come amid what many consider a fundamental change in the way investors analyze and invest in companies toward one that factors a firm's impact on the environment, society at large and how it conducts its own governance.\n\nShortened to the acronym ESG, Morgan Stanley wrote last month that the new focus is \"likely to dominate financial markets during the 2020s \" due to societal trends driving change across consumer, corporate and investor behavior.\n\nCompanies with more diversity, for example, tend to score better all else equal when an investor is evaluating a prospective stake.\n\nBut firms like Morgan Stanley and Carlyle stress that their focus on ESG isn't purely altruistic, but rather critical to to understanding a company's growth potential as well as possible risks, among other things.\n\n\"The Covid-19 crisis has brought social and governance elements to the fore, and these have gained a lot of traction with investors,\" the firm said in a note to clients. \"In particular, there has been an added focus on how companies treat their employees, suppliers, customers and society as a whole, as investors incorporate the treatment of stakeholders into their investment process.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Hashtags won't cut it. Corporate America faces a higher bar in a reckoning on racial inequality\n\nIn recent days, corporate America has made its strongest statements yet on racial inequality. But the protesters marching through small U.S. towns and gathering in large cities around the world want more than words.\n\nBusiness leaders now face a reckoning that won't be hashtagged away. Many are under pressure from activists, customers and even their own employees to demonstrate tangible actions.\n\n\"The sense of urgency is something we and many corporate leaders haven't seen in our lifetime,\" said Stephanie Creary, assistant professor of management at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, and who researches identity and diversity. Creary said she and more than a dozen of her academic colleagues have been \"inundated\" with calls from large and small businesses \"all trying to figure out what to do next.\"\n\nA shift in public opinion is pushing companies to do more. Most American voters now support Black Lives Matter, according to a survey by online polling firm Civiqs . That support has jumped to 53% from 46% since the death of George Floyd in police custody on May 25.\n\nThe vast majority of the public now expects CEOs to express support for racial equity and factors that in when deciding where to spend money. In a poll released Wednesday by Morning Consult, 81% of respondents said they agreed that CEOs should express or reaffirm that their company's hiring process is equitable and accessible to diverse populations, and that they should provide specifics about how they will ensure that.\n\nNearly 70% of the more than 11,000 people polled in May and June said how a CEO reacts to an issue, such as the Black Lives Matter movement, would permanently affect their decision to buy from the company.\n\nMany police-involved deaths have inspired protests, but the video of a Minneapolis police officer kneeling on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes struck a nerve that has catalyzed huge crowds at marches and political debates in Washington, D.C. Floyd's death and those of Breonna Taylor , Ahmaud Arbery and other Black Americans sparked a national conversation that appears to be gaining momentum rather than fading away.\n\nSeveral companies are now lobbying for laws to stop police-involved deaths and hate crimes. Delta Air Lines signed a letter with dozens of companies calling for police reforms, including mandating de-escalation training to reduce the use of force. General Mills , Land O'Lakes and KPMG also signed.\n\n\"Sesame Street\" teamed up with CNN on a town hall for kids. In the episode, Elmo's Dad defined racism and explained the reason why protesters are marching in the streets. The NFL, the sports organization that shunned Colin Kaepernick for taking a knee during the national anthem, has had a public change of heart on the protest of players. And NASCAR drivers, who draw many fans from conservative-leaning parts of middle America, held a moment of silence before a race in Atlanta. NASCAR this week banned Confederate flags from events.\n\nThe upheaval has been fueled, in part, by the coronavirus pandemic and recession , which has laid bare Black Americans' unequal access to education, higher-paying jobs and health care . Black Americans are dying at nearly two times the rate of white Americans from suspected virus-related cases, according to the Covid Tracking Project . As the virus spreads, many Black Americans continue to go to work at grocery stores, hospitals and nursing homes - jobs where they're deemed essential yet get low wages. And in many major urban school districts, Black children live in homes where they don't have internet access or a computer that allows them to attend school at home.\n\nJade Magnus Ogunnaike, deputy senior campaign director for Color of Change, said people aren't just marching for racial equity, they're calling for economic justice. She said some major companies, such as Nike and McDonald's , that have put out emotional commercials and sharp statements still pay their workers wages so low that it's difficult for them to feed their families.\n\n\"If you have extreme wealth inequity and extreme pay inequity, that is incompatible with this moment,\" she said. \"When we talk about Black Lives Matter, we don't only mean Black Lives Matter in death. We mean that the actual quality and conditions that Black people live in matter.\"\n\nWhile many Black Lives Matter protests have happened before, crowds are larger, marches are scattered throughout the country and participants are more diverse, said Chris Miller, head of global activism strategy at Ben & Jerry's . That, he said, has prompted more mainstream companies to step out and speak up.\n\nWalmart CEO Doug McMillon said protests have created a distinct opportunity to bring about change .\n\n\"What we see is a moment here, a moment where we can make a bigger difference,\" he said recently in an interview on CNBC's \" Squawk Box .\"\n\nCompanies have spent years reacting to reports of racial discrimination or bias that thrust them into the spotlight.\n\nEmployees at both General Motors and Fiat Chrysler have reported multiple instances of nooses hanging in at least two plants since 2017, according to lawsuits and media reports.\n\nIn an emailed statement Tuesday, GM said it met with national, state and local civil rights leaders and Ohio's attorney general's office following racial harassment issues at its Toledo plant. It said it added mandatory training at the plant on inclusion and zero tolerance for discrimination and now requires all North American workers to take it.\n\nNearly three years ago, Ford Motor was ordered to pay up to $10.1 million to settle sexual and racial harassment charges for a group of workers at two Chicago-area plants after an investigation by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n\nIn each instance, automakers have condemned such actions, launched internal investigations including bringing in outside investigators, and fired employees found responsible for the racist acts.\n\nGM CEO Mary Barra was one of the most outspoken of the automotive executives regarding the country's systemic racism after the deaths of Floyd and other Black Americans. She is commissioning an \"Inclusion Advisory Board\" of both internal and external leaders, which she will chair.\n\n\" It's my responsibility as CEO of this company to make sure it doesn't fall off the agenda,\" Barra said Tuesday during a LinkedIn webcast.\n\nExecutives with Ford and Fiat Chrysler also spoke out against racism and racial inequality in messages to employees following Floyd's death.\n\nStarbucks changed its policy to allow anyone to use its bathrooms after police arrested Donte Robinson and Rashon Nelson, two Black men, at one of its Philadelphia cafes in April 2018. The two men were waiting for business meeting to begin and sat down without ordering anything. An employee called the police. A video of the incident, posted on Twitter, went viral and led to protests and calls for boycotts of the coffee chain.\n\nWith its reputation as an inclusive and progressive brand under fire , Starbucks about a month later closed all of its company-owned cafes in the U.S. for a day of employee training aimed at stamping out racial bias. Industry experts estimated that the store closures cost the company millions in dollars in sales .\n\nAfter the May training session, Starbucks began regularly surveying its workers about its diversity and inclusion efforts. It also hired law firm Covington & Burling, with former Attorney General Eric Holder leading the effort, to assess Starbucks' policies and initiatives.\n\nRecent changes to encourage diversity and inclusion include launching an application portal this year that allows store-level employees, from baristas to store managers, to view internal promotion opportunities. In September, it launched a 15-course curriculum developed by Arizona State University to teach topics about bias, empathy and dialogue.\n\n\"No company is perfect. What sets Starbucks apart is the Company's willingness to learn from these missteps and to address their underlying causes,\" Holder wrote, in an assessment of its efforts. \"The Company did not treat these incidents as a public relations issue to be managed and then forgotten.\"\n\nThe National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in October 2017 issued a travel advisory for American Airlines after \"monitoring a pattern of disturbing incidents reported by African-American passengers.\" Among them a report from activist Tamika Mallory about racial bias when a pilot ordered her to deplane after a dispute over her seat.\n\nThe NAACP, which couldn't be reached for this article, lifted its travel advisory in 2018, after commending the Fort Worth, Texas-based carrier for commitments including mandatory implicit bias training for its roughly 130,000 employees. The five-step plan, known by the acronym PAUSE, calls for employees to become better aware of their own judgments and reactions, to figure out how best to approach a situation. The airline also put in place a new process for customers' complaints about discrimination that includes having an specially trained American Airlines staff member call the passenger to discuss the issue.\n\nAmerican appointed Kenneth Charles in January as chief inclusion and diversity officer, a new role and department, but CEO Doug Parker said that the not enough has been done.\n\n\"All that work, really important work, has had really [a] positive impact,\" Parker said in June 4 CNBC interview. \"What I think we are all seeing as a country is that those initiatives, while helpful, are insufficient and we need to do more .\"\n\n\"There are structural barriers in place that keep these disparities in place,\" he said.\n\nIn the past two weeks, some corporate leaders have been called out for race-related social media posts and actions in a way that's reminiscent of the #MeToo movement.\n\nThe editor in chief of food magazine Bon Appetit, Adam Rapoport, stepped down this week after an old Halloween photo showed him in brown face and a food writer accused the company of mistreating people of color. Athletic wear company Reebok and several gyms cut have ties with CrossFit after its founder and CEO, Greg Glassman, made light of Floyd's death and Covid-19 on Twitter. Glassman later resigned. And at some companies, including Adidas and Estee Lauder , sharp criticism by employees has prompted pledges to increase diversity and invest in causes that advance equity.\n\nAs company leaders and corporate groups have spoken out, their own makeup has underscored the need for more progress. Business Roundtable, for example, pledged to start a special committee to advance racial equity and justice. The group is made up of 185 chief executives from many U.S. companies - but it has only two Black members.\n\nOnly four Fortune 500 companies are led by Black CEOs.\n\nMany industries, including finance, skew white and male. A year ago, JPMorgan Chase started Advancing Black Pathways, a recruitment program aimed at increasing the number of Black professionals at the firm and helping close the racial wealth gap.\n\nYet JPMorgan's efforts have been complicated by its past. Like other banks, it's perpetuated policies that have made it harder for Black Americans to get lower interest rates, qualify for mortgages or access capital.\n\nAs recently as last year, a Black client and Black employee said the company discriminated against them. Former NFL player Jimmy Kennedy recorded conversations with a bank employee who referred to his race when explaining why he couldn't sign up as a \"private client,\" a designation that would have given him access to loans and travel benefits, according to a report by The New York Times .\n\nKennedy's JPMorgan financial advisor at the time, Ricardo Peters, said he was passed over for a promotion and transferred to a branch in a less-wealthy area, despite receiving awards for his performance. And he recorded a manager demeaning a Black prospective client and discouraging him from taking her business.\n\nPeters was later fired by JPMorgan. He then filed a discrimination claim with the EEOC and the civil rights division of the Arizona attorney general's office accusing the bank of discrimination, according to the Times report. Peters worked for JPMorgan in Arizona. JPMorgan denies Peters claim, the Times said.\n\nSekou Kaalund, JPMorgan Chase managing director and head of Advancing Black Pathways, said that  \"like most institutions in America,\" the bank has a checkered legacy, which sets up a trust barrier.\n\nHe said companies' pasts - now amplified by protesters - have raised the bar.\n\n\"I don't think people are going to settle for just the statement,\" he said. \"People are going to look ahead at four, six months, 12 months, three months. 'What have you done on that statement? How have you brought to life what you said you would do?'\"\n\n\"People will be looking for action-oriented items and executions versus just pacifying a moment with a statement.\"\n\nCompanies looking for solutions won't find a quick fix, said Magnus Ogunnaike of civil rights group Color of Change.\n\nShe said Black voices are underrepresented at many companies, but adding a Black person to a company's board or the C-suite isn't enough.\n\n\"Black faces in high spaces are not necessarily the answer to this problem,\" she said. \"A few Black people advancing to the top is not necessarily what people are fighting about right now.\"\n\nThe progressive group has pressed companies to release diversity reports, raise their minimum wage and examine their portrayal of Black people and police officers. It scored a victory this week when ViacomCBS canceled long-running reality TV show, \"Cops\" and A&E nixed \"Live P.D.,\" one of the highest-rated shows on basic cable.\n\nShe said corporate leaders must look top to bottom at their company with a civil rights audit that scrutinizes everything from worker pay and discrimination complaints to how they work with police.\n\n\"We need these corporations to not only issue statements that say that they value Black lives, they need to fundamentally look at how their corporations are structured,\" she said.\n\nCreary, the Wharton assistant professor, said business leaders need to examine issues within their walls such as who's ideas get accepted and who gets credit.\n\n\"Who gets to contribute sometimes in a hierarchical work team? The people who've been around the longest ... who are the most seasoned. They are the de facto bearers of credit.\"\n\nPart of JPMorgan's new approach has been to widen the funnel of people coming through the door by reaching out to Black students in their first two years of college, including at historically Black universities. This increases students' chances of landing an internship or job at the bank or another company.\n\nKaalund said the company is tracking its progress. It has hired more than 1,000 Black students so far. About 4% of its executive and senior level jobs are made up of Black professionals, as of 2019, but he said the number of Black managing directors and executive directors has grown by more than 50% since it launched a Black leadership initiative four years ago. It created and filled a new position in April - global head of diversity and inclusion - to step up policies that prevent discrimination within the company and beyond it.\n\nFor Ben & Jerry's, activism has been a part of its brand along with tie-dye T-shirts and creative ice cream flavor names. It was founded in 1978 by Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, who have been unabashed in advocating for progressive policies. It's now owned by Unilever .\n\nThe company's statement after the death of George Floyd stood out as one of the most forceful and specific. It called on the country to \"take concrete steps to dismantle white supremacy in all its forms.\" It laid out four major policy proposals, including the drafting of bipartisan legislation to hold police accountable and strengthening of the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division.\n\nThe company has a 10-person team of activists. It's led by Miller, who previously worked with Greenpeace and Sen. Bernie Sanders. In St. Louis, the company has fought alongside a nonprofit for the closure of an old, outdated prison and in Miami, it's worked with another organization to decrease the number of police officers in schools and increase funding for guidance counselors.\n\nThe company typically spends 10% to 20% of its annual discretionary marketing budget on social causes.\n\nIt has a program that turns some ice cream shop employees into \"changemakers\" that organize grassroots events, such as hosting a free ice cream social with a local nonprofit. And while most of its 245 U.S. shops are franchises, employees at company-owned shops and manufacturing jobs make a minimum wage of $18 an hour.\n\nBut Miller said the Vermont-based company still has plenty to do, especially when it comes to recruiting beyond its predominately white community.\n\n\"We're in one of the whitest states in the country and I think we've used that as a bit of a crutch or an excuse,\" he said.\n\nMiller said Ben & Jerry's recently began a new effort to track and increase the diversity of its suppliers, its workforce and its franchisees. That effort predated the protests.\n\n\"This is forever work,\" he said.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "DC Mayor suggests city will paint over Black Lives Matter Plaza near White House\n\nD.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D) issued a Tuesday statement suggesting the city may paint over the Black Lives Matter Plaza near the White House.\n\n\"The mural inspired millions of people and helped our city through a very painful period, but now we can't afford to be distracted by meaningless congressional interference,\" Bowser wrote in a post on the social platform X .\n\n\"The devastating impacts of the federal job cuts must be our number one concern. Our focus is on economic growth, public safety, and supporting our residents affected by these cuts,\" she added.\n\nHer words come a day after Georgia Rep. Andrew Clyde (R) introduced a new measure seeking to withhold funds from D.C. if the plaza is not renamed \"Liberty Plaza.\"\n\nThe bill, which is set to undergo review from the House committees on Agriculture and Infrastructure, urges officials to remove the Black Lives Matter phrase from \"each website, document, and other material under the jurisdiction of the District of Columbia.\"\n\nRepublican legislators have been encouraged to eradicate diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) efforts from all facets of government since the start of President Trump's second administration.\n\nDespite Bowser's meeting with the president in December prior to the start of his second tenure in the Oval Office, Republicans have introduced legislation to overturn the Democrats' and D.C.'s Home Rule law.\n\nSen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) and Rep. Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.) introduced the Bringing Oversight to Washington and Safety to Every Resident (BOWSER) Act, an acronym for Bowser, in early February in an effort to repeal D.C.'s autonomous style of government, citing crime rates and corruption.\n\nIf passed, the measure would repeal D.C.'s local legislative functions within a year.\n\nLee originally sought to pass the bill last year, but it failed in committee.\n\nCity leaders have fought for decades to obtain formal statehood to secure voting representation in Congress.\n\n\"This year, we look back with gratitude for those who came before us and fought for Home Rule, and we keep pushing for a future where we have full access to American democracy. We know that full access means D.C. statehood. It means we have voting representation in the House and two senators representing us in the Senate,\" Bowser said in 2023 .\n\n\"It means a more perfect democracy for our country - one where Americans living in the shadow of the Capitol, who have all the responsibilities of citizenship and who go to war to defend our freedoms, have representation in Congress. Our future is one where our Home Rule is not limited - where D.C. residents have full representation, full autonomy, and full access to our fundamental rights as American citizens,\" she added.\n\nBowser has not publicly commented on the BOWSER Act. The mayor's office did not immediately respond to The Hill's request for comment.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Why the Black Lives Matter movement matters to us all\n\n\"You can go back in history as far as you like, and we've never mattered.\" Those words did not come from an enraged protester at a Black Lives Matter rally; they were spoken quietly, by my grandfather, near the end of his life. He was describing what it felt like to be an Irish Catholic fighting for the British during World War I.\n\nThe exact words he used, as I recall, were \"We've always been cannon fodder.\" He was describing the experience of walking into machine gun fire from the German trenches at the Somme , being shot, and ending the war as a POW, all as the \"subject\" of an empire that couldn't have cared less whether he existed. Those experiences, and that sense - that his life didn't matter - persuaded him and the rest of my Irish family to leave for America.\n\nI have thought of that conversation often in the past few months, when the COVID-19 pandemic has made human life seem so expendable, and when life was suffocated out of George Floyd with seeming indifference, triggering the current wave of protests around the country.\n\nThe American Dream was a dream deferred for my grandfather, as for so many immigrants. He and my grandmother, who had come alone to Ellis Island in her teens, worked hard to make ends meet. They witnessed the \"No Irish need apply\" bigotry, and the policing based on filling the so-called \"paddy wagons\" with the unruly Irish. He found work driving a trolley, then a bus; she was a live-in maid, scrubbed floors and worked in a bank, at times all at once. They never owned a house or a car, and didn't have a telephone until the mid-1950s.\n\nWe, his descendants, have enjoyed opportunities beyond his dreams. We have worked hard, to be sure; no progress comes without real effort. We enjoy levels of education and affluence that were never open to him. We are proud of our efforts.\n\nBut let's not kid ourselves. We are also white.\n\nIn literally one generation, my family ceased to be considered undesirable immigrants and began to be afforded the opportunity for advancement for which America has become renowned. That transformation would not have occurred, in my view, had we been of another race, specifically African American.\n\nOver the past several years, as the subject matter of reparations has been raised by black leaders, many of my contemporaries have been dismissive of the concept. The argument goes something like this: \"Our family never owned slaves; we weren't even here when that peculiar institution flourished. In fact, we were tantamount to slaves ourselves, denied education, opportunity, the right to own real property. We were victims as well. Why should we pay for evils that were committed long before we arrived? We are not white supremacists. Besides, look at all of the progress in civil rights that has been made over the past 50 years. Our generation elected Barack Obama.\"\n\nAll of which is true and, I have come to believe, completely beside the point.\n\nA similar response greets the Black Lives Matter movement: \"All lives matter.\"\n\nWell of course they do. Or should.\n\nBut there has been an African American community in America that has struggled to matter not for one generation but for 400 years . For the first 240 years, they were treated as chattel, property, counted as three-fifths of a person in a Constitution that afforded them no rights. Once emancipated, their freedoms were circumscribed by a legal regime that legitimized inferior status. Their right to vote was suppressed by tactics such as the imposition of taxes they couldn't pay and literacy requirements that poorly funded segregated schools assured they couldn't pass. They were beaten, humiliated, lynched by the thousands. Yet, like my grandfather, they fought for a nation that, for all they knew, couldn't have cared less about them as individuals.\n\nUnlike my grandfather and millions of immigrants, they never left. They migrated north instead, settling in cities such as Chicago, Detroit, New York, Newark, Baltimore, Boston, in search of the better life that America has made possible for so many others. They were welcomed with white flight, redlining real estate practices and other housing policies that isolated them in poverty and left them estranged from law enforcement. Most of them are still looking for the end of that American rainbow.\n\nAlthough there is no denying the progress reflected in the growth of the African American upper middle class, in the decline of the Jim Crow legal regime, and in the election of Obama, there is also no denying that relatively few African Americans have been admitted to American privilege, and that many communities are in crisis.\n\nThat crisis is reflected in the frequently cited statistics related to disparities in income , in public health mortality rates , in home ownership , in education , in arrest and incarceration rates , and in employment rates that add up to, in Michelle Alexander's phrase, \" The New Jim Crow .\" It is also, for me, reflected in the less frequently cited statistics that reflect a community that has turned in despair upon itself. According to the U.S. Department of Justice Bureau of Justice Statistics Report, \" Homicide Trends from 1980-2008 ,\" during that time span, black offenders - drawn from just 13 percent of our population, 7 percent if considering males alone - committed 52.5 percent of all the murders in America and 65.6 percent of all drug-related homicides, not for a year or two but for a generation. Overwhelmingly, moreover, the victims were other African Americans; 93 percent of black murder victims from 1980-2008 were murdered by other African Americans.\n\nBlack lives must be made to matter not just to the police, but to a larger society that has been indifferent at best, and institutionally racist at worst, content to allow poverty, education deficiency, public health failures, and even rampant violence to fester until they suppurate. George Floyd's suffocation has become emblematic of the stifled opportunities, the smothered hopes, the treatment of a large segment of the black community as if their lives didn't matter, as if, like my grandfather, they were being marched like cannon fodder into abbreviated lives.\n\nSeen in that perspective, the African American community's outsized contribution to the American military, music, literature, sports, science and other forms of culture represents a remarkable act of faith. I think that faith will prove justified, because unlike in most of the world, where individuals are \"subjects\" of a royal or statist elite, this country is committed to the dignity of the individual citizen as the source of ultimate sovereignty.\n\nWe have fallen tragically short of that ideal when it has come to black lives. For that reason, nothing less than the fate of the American experiment rides on the transformation so many are now demanding. America can fulfill its promise only when it addresses the injustice that haunted its foundation and has never been cured. America will be America only when black lives matter.\n\nJohn Farmer Jr. is director of the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University.

Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\nTwo-thirds of U.S. adults said they supported the movement following Floyd's death in 2020, according to a Pew analysis of the 5,073-person survey.\n\nOpinions on the movement vary by race, age and political leaning.\n\nBlack adults are the most likely to back the movement. According to the survey, 81 percent of Black adults in the U.S. support the Black Lives Matter movement, while 63 percent of Asian adults, 61 percent of Hispanic adults and 42 percent of white adults support it.\n\nWhite adults are less likely to support the BLM movement and are the most likely to believe that it is \"divisive\" or \"dangerous,\" the survey shows.\n\nYounger adults are also more likely to support the movement.\n\nPew found that 64 percent of U.S. adults between the ages of 18 and 29 back the Black Lives Matter movement. Meanwhile, 52 percent of 30- to 49-year-olds support the movement, 46 percent of 50- to 64-year-olds, and 41 percent of people 65 and older support the movement.\n\nYounger adults are also more likely to think positively of the movement. The survey shows that 41 percent of adults 18-29 years old describe the movement well or very well.\n\nAlmost 50 percent of young adults also said they believe the movement has been highly effective at bringing attention to racism, while 32 percent of 30- to 49-year-olds, 27 percent of 50- to 64-year-olds and 22 percent of people 65 and older said the same, according to the survey.\n\nAdults who align themselves more with the Democratic party are more likely to support the movement as well, the survey shows.\n\nOut of survey respondents, 84 percent of people who identified as Democrats or Democratic leaners support the movement, while 82 percent of Republicans or Republican leaners oppose it.\n\nDemocrats are also far more likely than Republicans to use words like \"empowering\" and \"inclusive\" to describe the movement.\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans were far more likely to use words like \"dangerous\" and \"divisive\" to describe the movement.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc.

Sign up for our weekly newsletter to stay informed and engaged.\n\nby Christian Spencer | Aug. 19, 2021 | Aug. 19, 2021\n\nStory at a glance:\n\nA new report finds the federal government has been targeting Black Lives Matter (BLM) protesters in an effort to stop the movement after it swept the nation and the world in the wake of George Floyd's death.\n\nThe report, first released by The Associated Press (AP) , was conducted in partnership with the Movement for Black Lives and Creating Law Enforcement Accountability & Responsibility clinic (CLEAR) at City University of New York School of Law.\n\nWhether or not protesters did commit any crimes, the report signifies that the highest offices in the federal government used criminal prosecution tactics to disrupt and discourage protesters from expressing themselves, the AP reported.\n\nFrom May 31 to Oct. 25, 2020, federal prosecutors filed 326 criminal cases against protesters.\n\n\"Much of the drive to use federal charges against protesters stemmed from top-down directives from former President Donald J. Trump and Attorney General William Barr,\" the report says. \"These directives, meant to disrupt the movement, were the primary reason for the unprecedented federalization of protest-related prosecutions seen in 2020.\"\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\nThroughout, the Department of Justice (DOJ) continually conveyed a false and heightened image of protesters and scapegoated local enforcement to justify its actions, according to the report.\n\nThe report says that in these directives and in statements about the protests, the DOJ \"painted an image of protesters as 'violent radicals,'\" and \"the government justified the expanded use of its authority and deployment of federal enforcement due to what it claimed was local and state leaders' 'abdication of their law enforcement responsibilities in deference to this violent assault.'\"\n\nBoth movement leaders and legal experts alike have said over the past year the federal government has used surveillance tactics and other mechanisms that are rooted in racism to target BLM protesters.\n\n\"The empirical data and findings in this report largely corroborate what Black organizers have long known intellectually, intuitively, and from lived experience about the federal government's disparate policing and prosecution of racial justice protests and related activity,\" the report stated.\n\nIn nearly 93 percent of the hundreds of federal criminal cases, there were similar state-level charges that could have been brought against defendants.\n\nThe report says these findings highlight \"the government's aggressive assertion of federal jurisdiction and its naked attempts at disrupting the movement to defend Black lives.\"\n\n\"We want to really show how the US government has continued to persecute the Black movement by surveillance, by criminalizing protests, and by using the criminal legal system to prevent people from protesting and punishing them for being engaged in protests by attempting to curtail their first amendment rights,\" said Amara Enyia, the Movement for Black Lives' policy research coordinator.\n\n\"It is undeniable that racism plays a role,\" Enyia said. \"It is structurally built into the fabric of this country and its institutions, which is why it's been so difficult to eradicate. It's based on institutions that were designed around racism and around the devaluing of Black people and the devaluing of Black lives.\"\n\nRace data was available for 89 of the defendants, or 27 percent, according to the report.\n\nOf those numbers, 52 percent were identified as Black, and of those Black defendants, 91 percent were male.\n\nMaking up most of the protest-related charges were people from Portland, Oregon, at 29 percent. Chicago, Las Vegas, Washington, D.C., and Minneapolis follow as the next highest places.\n\nREAD MORE STORIES FROM CHANGING AMERICA\n\nGEORGE FLOYD MURAL REPORTEDLY DESTROYED BY LIGHTNING BOLT\n\nFAMILIES SUE AFTER THEME PARK CHARACTER FLASHES WHITE SUPREMACIST SIGN IN PICTURES\n\nIN HISTORIC MOVE, JAMAICA WILL DEMAND REPARATIONS FROM BRITAIN OVER SLAVERY\n\nHIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS REENACT GEORGE FLOYD'S MURDER WITH BLACKFACE, PRINCIPAL RESIGNS\n\nIN BOMBSHELL INTERVIEW, OBAMA SAYS SOME MEDIA 'STOKING THE FEAR AND RESENTMENT' OF WHITE AMERICA\n\nDEREK CHAUVIN'S GUILTY VERDICT IN THE MURDER OF GEORGE FLOYD GIVES HOPE TO BLACK AMERICA\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc.

      "text": "Most parents discussed Black Lives Matter with children ages 8-11: Study\n\nIn 2020, Black and white parents discussed the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement with their children ages 8-11, but the way the topic was discussed differed greatly depending on race, a new study has found.\n\nResearchers at Northwestern University sampled more than 700 socioeconomically diverse Black and white parents six weeks before the 2020 murder of George Floyd and three weeks after. They found that Black parents had more conversations on race than white parents, and the difference became more pronounced after Floyd's murder by a white police officer.\n\nWhile 84 percent of Black parents had spoken to their children about the BLM Movement in the year following Floyd's murder, only 76 percent of white parents reported the same.\n\nWhen talking with their children, 78 percent of Black parents said they affirmed Black lives - such as by telling their child that they are important regardless of what the media says - and acknowledged systemic racism. Only 35 percent of white parents indicated they had shared similar messaging with their children.\n\n\"While it is notable that many parents, including white parents, were talking with their children about Black Lives Matter, it is more important to consider what parents said,\" developmental psychologist Leoandra Onnie Rogers, lead researcher on the study, said in a statement.\n\nRespondents were also given open-ended questions. Their responses from those were then coded and categorized by the research team.\n\nThe researchers found that Black parents were far less likely to use \"colorblind\" messages when talking with their children than white parents, and these differences too were more pronounced after Floyd's death.\n\nHowever, in the open-ended questions section, 27 percent of white parents provided responses that appeared to be copied from Internet sources and pasted word for word into the survey.\n\nWhite parents, the study found, were also more likely than Black parents to \"communicate uncritical equality,\" such as by saying things like \"All lives matter no matter your skin color.\"\n\n\"Encouraging parents to talk about race, to break the silence, is necessary but insufficient,\" Rogers said. \"The upside is these data suggest that parents are listening to the societal conversation, and the concerted effort to engage parents and families in race talk did seem to influence the overall frequency of the reported conversations. However, the depth and substance of these conversations warrants further attention.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Why I can't raise my fist with Black Lives Matter, but I will fight for you\n\nAmerica is changing fast! Sign up for our weekly newsletter to stay informed and engaged.\n\nby Vanessa Garcia | Jun. 03, 2021\n\nLast year, as protesters marched for Black Lives Matter, I stood in solidarity with the Black community, and, like everyone I knew, I wanted justice not only for George Floyd but for the long line of Black lives who have suffered due to a racial inequity in our country that haunts us not just as a nation but as a human race; a generational playing field made uneven by the echoes of ghosts we can still hear coming from the chained bowels of ships that reached our shores across the Middle Passage. We trafficked in human beings, we sold souls. Reparations should have come a long time ago.\n\nI support Black lives. But I could not and still cannot raise my fist alongside BLM.\n\nAs most of us know by now, the logo for BLM is a clenched, raised fist. When the movement asked me to show my solidarity by posting this fist on Instagram and Facebook, I just couldn't do it, despite my very own family being mixed race. I maintained my support for Black lives, used my voice in the ways I could, but I refused the symbol because, for me as a Cuban American, the raised fist also symbolizes a haunting history that has reverberated for generations.\n\nIt represents the rise of a regime that tortured members of my family and has murdered so many of my people. I am not the only Cuban American for whom the raised fist was a highly problematic trigger of past trauma , given the symbol's roots in Communist movements across time and history. There were other groups who have been affected by Communism's repressive regimes that felt the same - some Venezuelan Americans, for instance.\n\nThe \"fear of the fist\" was the fear that BLM was saying: The way to equalize the playing field = Communism. For those of us who know better, who have been directly affected by the outcomes of Communism, who understand how Black lives fare under Communism (not well, to say the least), the fist jolted us. To add to the symbolism, the BLM organization wrote an elegy in Fidel Castro's defense on Medium after his death, which ended with the words: \"Fidel Vive!\" Back in 2015, two of BLM's co-founders even identified themselves as \" trained Marxists .\"\n\nDespite the fact that the movement now includes people that would never call themselves \"Marxists,\" the word itself and what it stands for - alongside phrases like \"Fidel Vive!\" clenched inside a fist - is chilling for many Cuban Americans.\n\nLast year, I wanted, more than anything, to explain where that chill came from, but I feared that saying anything at the time, could draw light from where it absolutely needed to collectively shine at that moment: on Black lives.\n\nNow, however, I think it's important to share what I couldn't then if I am to be a true ally and, also, to ask for allyship in return. I believe true allyship must be founded in mutual understanding.\n\nTo fully understand my trigger , you would have to know that I am the daughter of Cuban refugees. That my grandfather spent 15 years as a political prisoner in Cuba. That my other grandfather's brother was also a political prisoner; given electroshocks as a form of torture in prison. To understand my trigger, you would have to know that many of my Cuban refugee friends are artists who cannot live or work freely in Cuba because the law is, literally, codified to instill the fear of imprisonment and death against those who speak out against the State. Cuba is, simply put, not free .\n\nBeyond my own personal experience, Cuba is a country where unlawful and politically motivated torture and murder of its own people still exists. One has to simply read through the 2020 reports on Human Rights practices issued by the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, to see what's happening in Cuba today: \"Disappearance ... torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, or punishment ... arbitrary arrests or detention ... denial of free public trials ... unlawful interference with privacy, family, home, [and] correspondence...\" The list goes on and on.\n\nIt was hard to grapple with BLM's fist as a signifier when the raised-fist symbol triggered everything that had tried to destroy members of my family and still enslaves my motherland. This conflict was made exponential because members of my family, both immediate and extended, are both Cuban and Black.\n\nLast year, we felt racism and prejudice breathing down our necks, as we tried to catch our own breaths underneath our masks. At one point during the pandemic, my sister and her family - a family comprised of a Black man, a Hispanic woman, and mixed-race children - considered driving from California, where they live, to Miami, where I live. It had been the longest time we'd ever gone without seeing each other, and we were getting desperate. But, we were also really scared they might be pulled over, or that there might be some violent action taken against them on the road, especially given the heightened racial tensions of the moment. We were, in other words, scared of what it could mean for a Black family to drive across the South at night. That we are still afraid of this is an American tragedy.\n\nThis fear is not unfounded. My sister and her family, just a few years ago, had rocks hurled at their home in Sherman Oaks, California. It was, as we understand it, a hate crime. One that pushed them from their house and neighborhood. My niece and goddaughter, who was close to 3 years old at the time, tried to grasp what was happening as one rock after another was thrown at her window. One day, she will piece what happened together, and what she will see breaks my heart in half. For now, she just refers to that house as \"the broken house.\"\n\nThe side of myself that wanted to make sure not a single stone was ever hurled in hate again prevented what my Cuban side felt from speaking fully at the time or making a big deal about the fist. BLM was and is, too, necessary. And more so, I was grateful to be able to do, in the United States, what is not allowed in Cuba: to protest freely.\n\nSome Cuban Americans, Venezuelan Americans, and Nicaraguan Americans who brought up their feelings against BLM's symbol in everyday conversation were shunned as a result, called \"crazy Trumpers,\" even when they were not aligned with former President Trump - their own pain and marginalization belittled and ignored. Others were called \"right-wing nutjobs\" under the stereotype that \"all Cuban Americans are hardline Republicans,\" even though that is also untrue. For me, it was a constant battle between factions that shouldn't have been battling to begin with, as we were and are all seeking liberation.\n\nI understand that there are moments when we all need to come together and bring the sun to shine on one particular issue, so that, finally, we can all see that issue. Sometimes it takes hundreds of years to drag the sun to a field that's lived in dark and dying shadow for all those centuries. I understand that this is why \"All Lives Matter\" was so enraging and painful a response to \"Black Lives Matter.\" Like having those who have held the sun all the while, who have finally lent it out, ask for it back, relegating that dark corner to darkness once more. As someone whose own history still lives in veiled shadow, I understand that.\n\nI also long for light.\n\nIf allyship is about bringing the periphery to the center, or marginalized and oppressed groups to the light, then what happens when marginalized groups are allies for each other? What if what we think we know about a group, isn't the reality because that group sits in darkness too? At some point, we do actually have to listen to each story, and our knee-jerk reaction cannot be to kick each other out of the light.\n\nMost recently, I was invited to speak on a panel about the San Isidro Movement , an urgent movement of young Cubans inside Cuba who are fighting for the right to be free from tyranny. Currently, its members - who are bravely and outwardly calling the island \" a grand center for torture \" - are under threat of death by the regime. They disappear from one day to the next and are being held hostage by the government.\n\nThe poster for this event was a raised fist wrapped in the Cuban flag. Talk about a paradox. On one level, you could say that the event appropriated BLM's raised fist, which had, in turn, appropriated the Cuban Revolution's raised fist. But that complexity is way too simplistic. It's even more layered than that. There is context and history about what it means to take back imagery, particularly that of propaganda, and complicate it. Make it multiple, a multiplicity upon which our democracy and American future stands. A multiplicity upon which true allyship stands. A multiplicity which is, in fact, the meaning of allyship. And herein, is where the paradox comes full circle and I can almost begin to see a moment where the symbol of the fist can continue to evolve, and I can raise mine, alongside the Black community and my own Cuban people. Because in the places we share story, we can see and share light.\n\nWe're all fighting against injustice and inequity. For freedom and joy, and quality of life. For life itself. For breath. And no, this is not the same as saying \"All Lives Matter\" because what I'm aiming for here is a conversation, not a slogan - a bridge not a dam. An understanding that you cannot assume there is not darkness where you cannot see - that's the definition of darkness. The Cuban people, too, are begging to be released from their yoke, needing light. And not light which shines on the oppressor, like an elegy to Fidel does, but one that listens to activists like Luis Manuel Alcántara, an artist who was, until recently, held captive by the Cuban regime. He and others are risking their lives daily as we speak in order to fight for a better one.\n\nI cannot yet raise my fist for BLM, but I can still be a strong and strident ally. And I can share this story, and, in sharing this story, I can be an even stronger one. This is the beauty of being American.\n\nVanessa Garcia is an award-winning novelist, playwright, screenwriter, and journalist.

      "text": "Black Lives Matter marks 10th anniversary with new calls for justice\n\nTrayvon Martin was 17 years old when he was shot and killed by George Zimmerman. His death, and the subsequent acquittal of Zimmerman, sparked the birth of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement.\n\nOn Thursday, the movement recognized its 10th anniversary, a moment when activists acknowledged progress over the last decade but also the amount of work that needs to be done.\n\n\"We have the duty to carry on this movement and our mission will always be rooted in dismantling white supremacy and systems of oppression,\" D'Zhane Parker, a board member for the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation (GNF), told The Hill .\n\nBLM organizations will commemorate the decade with in-person and virtual events, issuing renewed calls to reallocate money from police departments and into Black communities that have suffered from police brutality, unequal treatment in criminal justice systems and mass incarceration, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThough more white people have been killed by police, Black people are disproportionately impacted. Data from the NAACP finds that while white people make up a little more than 60 percent of the population, they make up about 41 percent of fatal police shootings. Black people make up only about 13.4 percent of the population and 22 percent of fatal police shootings. That means Black people are about twice as likely as white people to be shot and killed by police officers.\n\nIn 2022, at least 1,192 people were killed by police, the highest number ever recorded, according to the Mapping Police Violence database. Of those people, 100 were unarmed. Black people were three times more likely than white people to be killed, and they were also more likely to be unarmed.\n\n\"The reason why we say Black lives matter is not because we're saying our lives are more valuable than other lives, but we're saying we live we live in a country, in a world, where our lives do not matter and the system continues to show us that every single day by allowing cops to get away with wrongful murders and wrongful death and by allowing the systems of oppression to continue,\" Parker said.\n\nSince the BLM movement's founding by organizers Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors and Opal Tometi, Twitter users have posted more than 44 million tweets with the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nBlack social media users are more likely to post or share their support for the Black Lives Matter movement, with 43 percent saying social media is an extremely or very effective way of bringing attention to the issue of police brutality.\n\nThe movement has survived a backlash since its beginnings.\n\nFormer President Trump in 2020 called Black Lives Matter a \"symbol of hate,\" while his former attorney Rudy Giuliani accused BLM activists of being killers and terrorists who \"hate white people\" in an interview on Fox News.\n\nMeanwhile, phrases like \"blue lives matter,\" in support of police, along with \"all lives matter\" and \"white lives matter\" cropped up on social media and in political rhetoric as a way of combating the BLM message.\n\nShalomyah Bowers, a Black Lives Matter GNF board member, called the backlash a \"whitelash.\"\n\n\"When Black people have tried to express themselves, have made gains in society, have sort of tried to take a stand in response to movements, there is always a reaction, and that reaction is typically with violence,\" Bowers said. \"That reaction is typically in the form of policy or trying to discredit Black people, Black organizers, Black work as a way to push back on any gains that Black people are trying to make in society.\"\n\nThe decade has seen activists with the group move into positions of political leadership.\n\nRep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) was a Black Lives Matter activist in Missouri, where Michael Brown was killed by a law enforcement officer, before her election as the first Black woman to represent Missouri.\n\nIt has also seen efforts at federal legislation fall short.\n\nIn 2021, then-Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.) introduced the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, a sweeping police reform bill that would ban chokeholds and no-knock warrants, end qualified immunity and prohibit racial and religious profiling by law enforcement officers.\n\nQualified immunity, established by the Supreme Court in 1967, keeps police officers from being put on trial for unlawful conduct - including the use of excessive or deadly force - unless the person suing proves both that the conduct was unlawful and that the officers knew they were violating \"clearly established\" law.\n\nThe bill passed the then-Democratic House but talks for a compromise fell apart in the GOP-led Senate.\n\nRep. Ayanna Pressley (D-Mass.) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) reintroduced legislation this year to end qualified immunity.\n\n\"We have to listen to the families who have been tragically impacted, who have been robbed of their loved ones ... at the hands of law enforcement, of police, people who have taken an oath to protect and to serve,\" Pressley said.\n\n\"Black Lives Matter is more than statement T-shirts and hashtags and plazas artfully painted,\" she added. \"It's about codifying the value of Black lives in our budgets and in our policies. And it's about advancing policies that seek to undo centuries of harm and to turn a different path forward.\"\n\nEven as federal policy has stalled in Congress, there have been some changes at the state level.\n\nMore than 30 states have passed 140 oversight and reform laws on local police since the 2020 murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police officers.\n\nSome of these laws restricted tactics such as no-knock warrants, which led to the death of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Ky. - another touchstone event from 2020. Others ban the use of neck restraints - like what officers used against Floyd - and mandated the use of body cameras.\n\n\"I know there can never really be justice,\" Pressley said. \"Justice would mean that their loved ones will still be here. But there must be accountability.\"\n\nMinneapolis voted to shift nearly $8 million from police funding to services like violence prevention and mental health crisis response teams after Floyd's killing.\n\nIn June 2020, Boston reallocated $12 million of its police overtime budget - about 20 percent - to instead invest in community programs such as trauma and counseling services.\n\nAnd in 2021, Los Angeles approved Measure J, which allocates 10 percent of the county's revenue to community investment and alternatives to incarceration.\n\nThe work continues this weekend.\n\nOn Saturday, the \"#BLMTurns10 People's Justice Festival\" will be held in Leimert Park in Los Angeles. The neighborhood, for many, is considered a cultural hub for Black Los Angelenos.\n\nThe festival, according to the AP, will include a pop-up garden dedicated to families of people killed by police and white supremacist violence. Sybrina Fulton, Trayvon Martin's mother, was invited to speak along with and scholar and activist Cornel West, who is running for U.S. president as a third-party candidate.\n\nMeanwhile, the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation will launch a new campaign titled Defund the Police Week of Action. The organization is encouraging supporters to ask elected officials to introduce a proclamation that establishes July 13 as \"Black Lives Matter Day.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc.

Bystander video shows Floyd saying he couldn't breathe multiple times as Chauvin continued to press down on him.\n\nIn downtown Sydney, at least 1,000 people gathered to protest, The Associated Press reported . Protesters in the city won a last-minute legal battle, allowing them to demonstrate without fear of being arrested.\n\nOrganizers in Brisbane reported that 30,000 demonstrators showed up, though local police estimated that number to be closer to 10,000, according to Reuters .\n\n\"Whether you're talking about the U.S. or right here in Australia, black lives matter,\" Queensland Environment Minister Leeanne Enoch told the AP. \"Black lives matter today. Black lives matter every day.\"\n\nIn Australia, the outlet noted, indigenous people make up 2 percent of the country's population but 27 percent of its prison population.\n\nThe most disadvantaged ethnic minority in Australia, indigenous people have above-average rates of infant mortality, lower levels of education and employment, and shorter life expectancies than other Australians.\n\nSmaller protests also occurred in Seoul and Tokyo.\n\nProtests were planned in Paris but were banned by police. Authorities pointed to COVID-19 concerns and fear of public unrest as reasons for the ban.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved.

On June 5, racial justice organization Black Lives Matter confirmed it had received a $1 million donation from South Korean pop group BTS and its record label, Big Hit Entertainment.\n\nShortly after the news became public, BTS fans organized an online campaign to match the donation under the hashtag #MatchAMillion and reached their goal in just 25 hours.\n\nK-pop fans are known for their prolific social media activity and have used their influence to support social justice issues. On Instagram and Twitter, they have taken over white supremacist hashtags with fancams - short videos of their favourite pop idols performing. When the Dallas Police Department asked the public to submit videos of \"illegal activity\" during protests to its iWatch Dallas app, fans encouraged each other to submit fancams instead, and the app went temporarily offline. More recently, fans were credited alongside TikTok-using teenagers for registering en masse for tickets for President Trump's rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, but not attending.\n\nThese fanbases are sometimes generalized as young and obsessive individuals who occasionally take collective action. But they have a history of raising money for charity and breaking social media records, and BTS fans in particular are enabled by the semi-structured organization of the fanbase and the diversity within their ranks.\n\nA BTS fan account called @BTS_History613 tweeted frequent screenshots of the fundraising page as it was underway, helping the fanbase track the total amount raised.\n\n$1,000,000\n\nFundraiser\n\nsurpasses\n\n$1 million\n\n@BTS_History613 begins\n\ntweeting updates\n\n$500,000\n\nVariety reveals\n\n$1M donation\n\n0\n\n12 a.m. GMT\n\n4 a.m.\n\n8 a.m.\n\n12 p.m.\n\n4 p.m.\n\n8 p.m.\n\n12 a.m.\n\n4 a.m.\n\nJune 7\n\nJune 8\n\nA BTS fan account called @BTS_History613 tweeted frequent screenshots of the fundraising page as it was underway, helping the fanbase track the total amount raised.\n\n$1,000,000\n\nFundraiser surpasses\n\n$1 million\n\n@BTS_History613 begins\n\ntweeting updates\n\n$500,000\n\nVariety reveals\n\n$1M donation\n\n0\n\n12 a.m. GMT\n\n4 a.m.\n\n8 a.m.\n\n12 p.m.\n\n4 p.m.\n\n8 p.m.\n\n12 a.m.\n\n4 a.m.\n\nJune 7\n\nJune 8\n\nA BTS fan account called @BTS_History613 tweeted frequent screenshots of the fundraising page as it was underway, helping the fanbase track the total amount raised.\n\n$1,000,000\n\nFundraiser\n\nsurpasses\n\n$1 million\n\n@BTS_History613\n\nbegins tweeting\n\nupdates\n\n$500,000\n\nVariety reveals\n\n$1M donation\n\n0\n\n12 a.m. GMT\n\n12 p.m.\n\n12 a.m.\n\nJune 7\n\nJune 8\n\nBTS is a seven-member K-pop group whose music draws from several genres, including hip-hop, pop and R&B. Since their 2013 debut, they've become known for their meticulous choreography, elaborate music videos with connected storylines and youth-focused lyrics that touch on themes such as self-confidence, mental health and societal norms.\n\nIndividual fans and the collective fanbase are known as ARMY, which stands for Adorable Representative M.C. for Youth, and the term is often used without an article like \"He's ARMY,\" and \"ARMY raised $1 million.\"\n\nBTS is short for Bangtan Sonyeondan ( 방탄소년단 ) in Korean, which translates to \"Bulletproof Boy Scouts\". In 2017, the group said their name is also an acronym for the phrase \"beyond the scene\" in English.\n\nKim Nam-joon\n\nRM\n\nSingers\n\nRappers\n\nMin Yoon-gi\n\nKim Seok-jin\n\nJung Ho-seok\n\nJin\n\nSuga\n\nJ-Hope\n\nKim Tae-hyung\n\nPark Ji-min\n\nJeon Jung-kook\n\nJimin\n\nV\n\nJungkook\n\nBTS is short for Bangtan Sonyeondan ( 방탄소년단 ) in Korean, which translates to \"Bulletproof Boy Scouts\".

The band and their label pledged 500 million KRW (USD 418,897.60) and 3% of the physical albums from their \"Love Yourself\" collection, along with six other fundraising initiatives.\n\nIn March 2018, a then 16-year-old Brazilian fan asked if any of her Twitter followers wanted to collaborate on a charity project to donate to the UNICEF campaign. Within a month, they launched \"One In An ARMY.\" Since then, the volunteer group of nearly 30 organizers and translators has conducted monthly campaigns for 22 charities across the globe, in addition to several other campaigns such as the \"ARMY Share The Warmth\" drive to donate money and items to local shelters during the winter. Instead of collecting the money and distributing it, One In An ARMY creates pages on fundraising websites for fans to donate directly to the charities.\n\n\"We are a small charity so the support was really valuable to us.\" - Christina Lake from Key Changes, a U.K. nonprofit\n\n$10,000\n\n5,000\n\nNo projects in April and June 2019\n\n0\n\nA\n\nM\n\nJ\n\nJ\n\nA\n\nS\n\nO\n\nN\n\nD\n\nJ\n\nF\n\nM\n\nA\n\nM\n\nJ\n\nJ\n\nA\n\nS\n\nO\n\nN\n\nD\n\nJ\n\nF\n\nM\n\nA\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n\"We are a small charity so the support was really valuable to us.\" - Christina Lake from Key Changes, a U.K. nonprofit\n\n$10,000\n\nNo projects in April and June 2019\n\n5,000\n\n0\n\nA\n\nM\n\nJ\n\nJ\n\nA\n\nS\n\nO\n\nN\n\nD\n\nJ\n\nF\n\nM\n\nA\n\nM\n\nJ\n\nJ\n\nA\n\nS\n\nO\n\nN\n\nD\n\nJ\n\nF\n\nM\n\nA\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n\"We are a small charity so the support was really valuable to us.\" - Christina Lake from Key Changes, a U.K. nonprofit\n\n$10,000\n\n5,000\n\nNo projects in April and June 2019\n\n0\n\nA\n\nJ\n\nJ\n\nS\n\nO\n\nN\n\nD\n\nM\n\nM\n\nA\n\nJ\n\nF\n\nA\n\nJ\n\nO\n\nN\n\nD\n\nM\n\nM\n\nJ\n\nA\n\nS\n\nJ\n\nF\n\nA\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\nIn lieu of monthly projects for May and June this year, though, the project ran seven concurrent charitable campaigns to celebrate BTS' seventh anniversary. But when protests broke out across the U.S. at the end of May, fans asked One In An ARMY how they could support the Black Lives Matter movement and other racial justice campaigns in the U.S.\n\n\"As One In An ARMY is comprised entirely of volunteers, it would be almost impossible for us to set up a campaign to address a crisis situation,\" its website's FAQ section states, explaining that monthly campaigns are planned weeks in advance. To compromise, they set up a page on ActBlue - a U.S. Democratic party-affiliated fundraising platform - for fans to donate to 14 U.S. nonprofits. They tweeted the link on June 1.\n\nOn June 6, fans learned that BTS and their label had donated $1 million to Black Lives Matter. They decided to match that total and flocked to the ActBlue fundraiser page, raising donations to #MatchAMillion by June 8.\n\nOver the course of the previous 22 monthly campaigns, One In An ARMY raised over $98,000 for charity in total. During these eight days in June, fans raised more than 10 times that, almost all in just 25 hours between June 7 and 8. As of July 14, they have raised more than $1.3 million dollars.\n\nMonthly\n\ncampaigns\n\n#MatchAMillion\n\ncampaign\n\n$98,015\n\n$1,000,000\n\n$1,329,390\n\nMonthly\n\ncampaigns\n\n#MatchAMillion\n\nCAMPAIGN\n\n$98,015\n\n$1,000,000\n\n$1,329,390\n\nMonthly\n\ncampaigns\n\n#MatchAMillion\n\ncampaign\n\n$98,015\n\n$1,000,000\n\n$1,329,390\n\nARMYs aren't the only K-pop fans known for their acts of charity, but the speed with which BTS fans organized and the scale of the funds they raised in that time may be unprecedented, according to industry experts.\n\nOne way BTS fans were able to organize on such a large scale is because of the diversity of their fanbase online, and how K-pop's popularity has grown across older demographics.\n\nAccording to Chicago-based company Vivid Seats, a growing percentage of fans are from older age groups. When tickets for the Love Yourself tour went on sale in 2018, 43% of fans searching for tickets on the BTS ticket site were women between the ages of 18 and 24. Two years later, just 24% belonged to that demographic when tickets to the Map of the Soul: Persona tour went on sale, and women over the age of 45 doubled from 7.5% to over 16%.\n\n\"Thanks to BTS, in my later stage of life I've got a whole new group of friends,\" said Nan Paturzo, 57, who created the Bangtan Moms and Noonas online community for older fans. Paturzo, who is half-Korean, said she had never embraced her Korean heritage until she started listening to BTS three years ago. \"It's brought a whole richness to my daily life that for me, personally, has made me extremely happy.\"\n\n= 1% of web traffic\n\nMale\n\nFemale\n\n18-24\n\nyears\n\nold\n\n\"As a young Asian-American man, it's cool to have role models like them who are redefining aspects of music and culture.\"\n\n- Andy K., 26, U.S.\n\nCEO of aerospace startup\n\n25-34\n\n\"I like to think that they have found me, because I needed them, and not the other way around.\"\n\n- Elisa Greco Gambino, 37, Italy\n\nWorks in customer care for software company\n\n35-44\n\n45-54\n\n55-64\n\n\"Their performances were beyond the talents and expressions I'd seen before.

That helps them afford the band's merchandise and concert tickets and creates an advertising market for products the band promotes to older consumers, including Samsung phones and Hyundai cars.\n\n\"We're buying cars and selling out stadiums; you can't just do that with some overexcited girls,\" said Erika Overton, 40, one of the administrators of One In An ARMY. \"This is not just a fan group to enjoy music - it's an economic force, and something you can't really dismiss as something trivial.\"\n\nThough the economic power of some BTS fans is part of how the #MatchAMillion reached its goal, the structure of the online fanbase enabled fans to share the idea and the hashtags quickly with each other and with non-fans.\n\n\"What ARMY demonstrates from the very beginning of their existence but especially in moments like these is that you don't need people with a million dollars,\" said Elliot Sang, a writer and YouTuber in New York. \"You can have people who are just volunteering who are just working from wherever they want that just simply care about doing something come together and volunteer out of their own desire.\"\n\n\"That's what One In An ARMY was premised on; it's just random people from all parts of the world and all age groups saying, 'Let's do this.'\"\n\nOne In An ARMY is part of a larger ecosystem of the BTS fanbase.

In 2018, several Twitter hashtags highlighting their experiences and stories went viral such as #BlackARMYBeauty, #BlackARMYsequality and #BlackoutBTS, which continues to recur. In the past, U.S. media coverage has painted K-pop fanbases as a monolith of socially-progressive activism.\n\n\"The positioning of the fandom as inherently or automatically progressive lets people who are racist slide under and ignores the fact that it's a fandom, which is made up of people - who are problematic, because they're people,\" said fan and media critic Zina H., who writes under the name Stitch.\n\nSome Black ARMYs say BTS has a responsibility to continue publicly supporting the racial justice protests that affect them. And BTS has also publicly acknowledged their music is based on hip-hop and R&B - genres that were created and popularized by Black American artists.\n\n\"It was important for them to take a stand against racism to show not only are they influenced by the music to make their own music, but also to show that they stand with them in terms of the struggles they face,\" said @naija0329, who helped coin the #MatchAMillion hashtag.\n\nBut some fans are also concerned the wider fanbase's attention to these racial issues may be fleeting.\n\n\"When people care - like seriously care - they're going to put action behind that and not just words. And to actually see action behind it? That made me wake up and have hope,\" said Nico Edward, who runs a BTS reaction video YouTube channel. \"People lash out and do the hashtags and stuff and that's fine to raise awareness, but it usually, historically, dies out and people's attention moves to other things. But we're still dealing with this every single day.\"\n\nBy Aditi Bhandari\n\nEdited by Jon McClure and Gerry Doyle\n\nOne In An ARMY, VividSeats , Twitter, FontAwesome, Foller.me"

      "text": "Washington Removing Black Lives Matter Painting Near White House: Mayor\n\nThe city of Washington is removing the Black Lives Matter mural from near the White House, Mayor Muriel Bowser said on March 4.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration has been terminating tens of thousands of workers in recent weeks, including employees of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nThe painting on a street near the White House is part of Black Lives Matter Plaza, which was created in 2020 amid nationwide protests that were sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minnesota.\n\n\"What we have to say to the young black youth is that they matter, we care about them, and we hear them, and we're listening to them, and we're trying to make all of our systems starting right here in Washington, D.C., more fair,\" Bowser said at a press conference at the time.\n\nRepublicans, who control both chambers of Congress, have repeatedly signaled their intent to become involved in city affairs in both large and small ways. A measure currently before Congress, named the BOWSER Act, seeks to completely revoke the Home Rule Act of 1973 that grants the capital city limited autonomy.\n\nSome representatives have used budget riders to target Washington policies ranging from marijuana legalization to whether right turns on red lights should be legal.\n\nBowser's publicly siding with Black Lives Matter activists in 2020 didn't appear to earn her much credit with them at the time. The local Black Lives Matter affiliate dismissed the move as \"performative wokeness\" and suggested that Bowser was biased toward police."

      "text": "Washington Begins Demolition of Black Lives Matter Plaza\n\nWASHINGTON-The sound of jackhammers filled the air on 16th street in downtown Washington as construction workers began removing a mural bearing the words \"Black Lives Matter\" from the pavement.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has also recently proposed that the federal government reclaim control of Washington in order to deal with its ongoing homelessness and crime. Rep. Andy Ogles (R-Tenn.) and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) have already introduced legislation to strip Bowser of her position.\n\nThe slogan was painted onto the street in 2020 and the street was renamed to Black Lives Matter Plaza after the death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis sparked a series of destructive protests around the country under the wider aegis of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nMegan Bailiff, president and CEO of Equus Striping, looked on as the workers began removing the slogan that her company had repainted in 2023, and which she had hoped would inspire future generations.\n\n\"My employees were so proud,\" she told The Epoch Times. \"They're heartsick, as am I, that its just going away.\"\n\nMany users on social media platform X cheered the mural's destruction, but some in-person onlookers of the demolition job were sad to see it go.\n\nJessica Sawyer, a retired school teacher, told The Epoch Times that she understood Bowser's decision to demolish the plaza.\n\n\"She has to protect the people in D.C., and she has to choose her battles. But I'm sorry that this is done,\" she said.\n\nRadio host Kymone Freeman, who jokingly described himself as an \"angry black man in therapy,\" was less sympathetic toward the mayor, saying he felt that she had capitulated on the issue of the plaza, and on removing homeless encampments in Washington.\n\nFreeman said he intends to return to the plaza on April 4-the anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.-to host a rally in support of Rep. Al Green (D-Texas), who was ejected from the House floor and censured after disrupting Trump's joint address to Congress on March 4."

Department of Transportation didn't respond by press time to a request for comment about the documents or to what steps were taken to ensure that the cost to taxpayers was kept to a minimum.\n\nThe 48-foot-tall capital letters run from curb to curb, and the text is followed by an image of the flag of Washington DC, two horizontal bars topped by three stars.\n\n\"What we have to say to the young black youth is that they matter, we care about them, and we hear them, and we're listening to them, and we're trying to make all of our systems starting right here in Washington, D.C., more fair,\" Ms. Bowser said at a news conference in July 2021, after construction began to make Black Lives Matter Plaza into a permanent installation.\n\nThe painted signs have sparked controversy, in part because of the actions of the BLM organization, which claims that there is systemic racism in the United States and has led related protests, some of which have turned violent.\n\nFounders of the movement have described themselves as \"trained Marxists.\"\n\nPolling shows that there's been a massive decrease in support for the BLM movement, amid conservative backlash and reports of infighting and financial mismanagement of some BLM groups.\n\nSome in the black community have opposed the murals. A woman wearing a \"Jesus Matters\" T-shirt and affiliated with a Christian ministry was arrested after dumping paint on part of New York City's mural in the summer of 2020.\n\nBrown was an 18-year-old black man shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014.\n\nFloyd died after a police officer knelt on his neck during an arrest in Minneapolis in 2020.\n\nThe study analyzed how police treatment changed over a five-year period between the two protest waves.\n\n\"The findings of the event study suggest that the BLM protests led police departments to pull back from interactions with the public and obtain body cameras, leading to increased crime and decreased police killings,\" study author Travis Campbell wrote.\n\nWhile police killings declined, homicides surged, the study shows. During the five-year period covered by the study, reported murders rose by about 11.5 percent, which translates to more than 3,000 additional homicides.\n\n\"The combined effect of police pullback and the widespread adoption of body cameras led to a 10% to 15% reduction in lethal force between the end of 2014 and 2019, preventing approximately 200 police killings,\" the study reads.\n\nIn addition, property crime arrests fell by about 12 percent, and the property crime clearance rate-the number of cases solved by law enforcement-saw a \"sharp decline\" of 8 percent, according to the study."

      "text": "BLM Activist Group Holds Nationwide 'Week of Action' In Schools\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement has extended its reach into schools across America.\n\nThis year, the Week of Action will take place from Feb. 5 to Feb. 9 and the theme is \"collective action.\"\n\nThe states include California, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Illinois, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin.\n\nThe group's founder is Tamara Anderson, an African American actress.\n\nAly Legge, the director of civic engagement for parental rights group Moms for America, says BLMAS's activism is inappropriate for schools.\n\n\"It reminds me of Mao's agents of change, his Red Guard,\" she told The Epoch Times, referring to the Chinese communist leader's student indoctrination programs.\n\n\"He ended up having agents of change infiltrate schools to essentially indoctrinate children for specific political reasons.\"\n\nThe BLMAS website states that it follows the core principles of the Combahee River Collective, \"a black feminist framework\" founded in the 1970s.\n\nIn schools, BLMAS advocates an end to \"zero-tolerance policies\" that punish children for breaking school rules.\n\nIt supports the removal of police officers from schools and replacing them with mental health counselors, as well as increasing the number of African American teachers, and mandating African American history classes for children from kindergarten to 12th grade.\n\n\"We've seen where that's done over the last couple of years with these videos coming out of children being jumped by mobs of other students,\" she said. \"If you're not actively deterring bad behavior, you're going to increase bad behavior.\"\n\nKimberly Fletcher, the president of Moms for America, said BLMAS's advocacy to increase the number of black teachers and to change the curriculum won't help.\n\n\"Teachers should be chosen on merit, not race or gender,\" she wrote to The Epoch Times by email. \"Curriculum should consist of a classical liberal arts education, true history, real science, and actual math. Political agendas do not belong in schools.\"\n\nHoward Zinn was a Marxist who wrote a textbook titled \"A People's History of the United States.\" The book presents American history through the eyes of socialist radicals.\n\nBLMAS also puts its support behind \"trans\" and \"queer\" identities. The group intends to \"work outside of the [gender] binary to achieve full liberation,\" the group's website reads.\n\nMs. Legge said the BLMAS agenda endangers all students and makes it harder for them to learn.\n\nNot knowing how to read and write makes it 400 percent more likely for someone to live in poverty, Ms. Legge said.\n\nHowever, BLMAS's agenda doesn't prioritize teaching children to read, write, and learn math, she said.\n\n\"We need to make sure that our schools are actively working on teaching our children how to think and not what to think,\" she said.\n\nTina Descovich, the cofounder of Moms for Liberty, told The Epoch Times she agrees BLMAS has its priorities wrong."

      "text": "Black Lives Matter Leader Stands Behind J6 Prisoners, Endorses Trump\n\nThe founder of a Black Lives Matter (BLM) organization is voicing his support of Jan. 6 prisoners and not shying away from endorsing former President Donald Trump as \"the best candidate we have.\"\n\nMark Fisher-who stepped down from his leadership position at BLM Rhode Island, which he co-founded, and is now founder and executive director of the Maryland-based BLM Incorporated-has stood in solidarity with leaders of the Proud Boys and led vigils of prayer for the people he believes to be political prisoners.\n\n\"They're lambs led to slaughter to be sacrificed as an example for all who might want to dissent in the future,\" Mr. Fisher told The Epoch Times. \"This is what the government does to those who express independent thought and want to stand up for what they believe.\"\n\nWhat he sees in the vindictive treatment of the J6 prisoners are similarities to how black people have been treated, he said, and his aspiration in establishing that connection is to find common ground.\n\n\"Antifa had a lot to do with the riots of 2020, and there were a lot of anarchist groups who just wanted to take advantage of the moment and were out for destruction,\" he said.\n\nBlack Lives Matter had been around years before George Floyd died while in police custody in Minneapolis in 2020, Mr. Fisher said. Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of murder in the case.\n\n\"That's when it became a political movement and the national and global center of attention,\" Mr. Fisher said. \"The media made us its darling, which it loves to do, and it was able to make us its scapegoat when things started to go south.\"\n\nMr. Fisher, a Christian who has a degree in theology with a background in being a pastor, expressed contempt for both the government and the media.\n\n\"I don't trust the federal or state government as far as I can throw them, and the media is trying to stop us from uniting,\" he said. \"It's the same media that caused the division between all of these marginalized groups in the first place to keep us at each other's throats.\"\n\nThe name of the organization itself has led to anger.\n\n\"It's not black lives are better,\" he said. \"It's not black lives are greater or black lives matter more. It's just simply black lives matter. That statement itself is so loaded that people have processed it differently through their own lens and experience.\"\n\nTo not see the significance of the statement from the perspective of a black person is to fail to see it through a lens of compassion, he said.\n\nMr. Fisher denied the framing of BLM as a Marxist organization.\n\n\"Black people want the same thing that white people want,\" he said. \"We want life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We want to make money and have a family. Do those sound like Marxist principles? To me, those are fundamentally American, entrepreneurial, and capitalist principles. We want to acquire wealth and leave something-as the Bible teaches us-for our children.\"\n\nMr. Fisher's current organization, BLM Incorporated, focuses on entrepreneurship education and financial empowerment for black Americans.\n\n\"It's a racist party with racist policies that negatively impact black families,\" he said. \"Black people are stuck on that plantation, mentally. They're slaves in their own minds because they refuse to see the big picture and how we've been used and abused by the Democratic Party with policies that are absolutely antithetical to what black people yearn for in this country, which is life, liberty, freedom, the pursuit of happiness, and a family to raise.\"\n\nMr. Fisher equally distrusts the Republican Party, which he said is its own corrupt institution.\n\n\"This is why Donald Trump is so popular,\" he said. \"He's anti-institution. He can't be bought. He can't be sold. He's going to give it to you straight and keep it real and those who relate to that love that about him. If you look at both parties and the potential candidates-including the current president and vice president-I think he's the best candidate we have. It's a no-brainer.\"\n\nThough framed by legacy media outlets as a racist and xenophobe, Mr. Fisher said President Trump has helped the black community \"100 percent.\"\n\n\"If you look at his policies, what he's done for our community has gone under the radar, and he doesn't brag about it,\" he said. \"He doesn't try to convince anyone he's not a racist, just like I'm not going to try to convince you that I'm not a racist. What you see is what you get, and when you know me, you'll know my heart.\"\n\nHowever, President Joe Biden has made frequent racist statements in his time as a politician in the limelight, Mr. Fisher said.\n\nHe recalled President Biden's statements on a radio show when running for office in 2020, when he stated, \"Well I tell you what, if you have a problem figuring out whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black.\"\n\n\"More and more black people every day are supporting him,\" he said. \"Look at the rappers. The latest one who just went turncoat on the Democrats was Waka Flocka Flame, who announced on Twitter that he's voting for Trump.\"\n\n\"Look at how a black neighborhood in Fulton County cheered Trump on the way to the county jail,\" Mr. Fisher added.\n\nThey know that the government is harassing him because they've seen it in their own lives, he said, and they recognize the persecution.\n\nMr. Fisher said he isn't afraid of taking flak from others in the black community because of his support of President Trump.\n\n\"I'm going to get the same pushback I expect for this that I got when I started the organization, not only from the white community but from my own community,\" he said. \"It's just something that goes with the territory when you're a leader. You must be bold. You can't be afraid to be ridiculed.\"\n\nMany people in the black community are secretly behind President Trump and want to see him back in office, Mr. Fisher said.\n\nHe pointed to President Trump's criticism of the word.\n\n\"I don't like the term woke because I hear 'woke woke woke,'\" President Trump told an audience at the Westside Conservative Club in Iowa in June 2023. \"It's just a term they use, half the people can't even define it, they don't know what it is.\"\n\nPeople have radically different conceptions of woke, Mr. Fisher said, but to use it in condemnation is harmful to race relations.\n\n\"The word's umbrella is so big that nobody knows what it means now,\" he said. \"It's become burnt out.\"\n\nAs the media continues to manufacture division, Mr. Fisher said it's important that all people reclaim their narratives and be open to each other's views, even if they disagree.\n\nSmall acts, like listening to others instead of the media, will go a long way.\n\n\"It's not going to happen by itself,\" he said. \"It's going to take deliberate, thoughtful work. We must exercise that power in taking control of our own lives so that we can shape our future. We all have that power.\""

Ron DeSantis's presidential campaign, said recently that he's now backing President Trump because he's the \"strongest commander\" and that's what America now needs in an increasingly chaotic world."

Signature Bank, which was shut down by regulators on March 12, contributed $850,000.\n\nExelon gave $3.1 billion, Fifth Third Bancorp gave $2.8 billion, Starbucks gave $1.6 billion, and Citigroup gave $1.1 billion. PNC Financial Services, Facebook, and New York Life Insurance funded over a billion dollars each.\n\nOther major donors who made triple-digit contributions include BlackRock which donated $810 million, CVS Health with $600 million, PayPal with $535 million, Mastercard with $500 million, Pepsi with $400 million, and Google with $370 million.\n\nMeanwhile, local BLM chapters are spending millions on initiatives aimed at defunding police departments, imparting school children with marxist doctrines like queer theory and critical race theory, and teaching kids to \"hate themselves, their peers, and their country.\"\n\nBanks are issuing subprime loans to end alleged \"systemic racism\" while corporations provide money that helps bail out \"violent rioters and criminals.\"\n\nAs examples, the institute points to the $30 billion \"Racial Equity Commitment\" program by JP Morgan Chase that intends to \"close the racial wealth gap\" as well as Microsoft's $250,000 contribution to a bail fund for BLM rioters-the Minnesota Freedom Fund.\n\nIn April 2022, it was reported that BLM co-founder Patrisse Cullors bought a $5.8 million property in October 2020, with the purchase made using donations received by the organization.\n\nTax forms from May 2022 revealed that BLM had paid close to $2.17 million in service fees to Bowers Consulting firm between July 2020 and June 2021."

Multimillion-dollar homes and a production deal with Warner Bros. soon followed, while friends and family were showered in consultant gigs worth millions of dollars.\n\nCapitalizing on the lucrative opportunities afforded to them as high-profile progressives, the three celebrity founders moved on, leaving the operation to wither in the hands of deputies who, sadly, turned on each other. A remarkable spate of legal trouble, brushes with law enforcement, and tangles with the Internal Revenue Service have all but spelled the death of the enterprise that you probably know best as Black Lives Matter.\n\nThe spectacular rise and fall of BLM has surprisingly little in common with earlier civil rights campaigns, other than, perhaps, good intentions. How BLM's leaders exploited George Floyd's murder to raise millions that they then put into their own pockets more closely resembles the stories of famous grifters like Elizabeth Holmes of Theranos or Sam Bankman-Fried's foray into \"effective altruism.\"\n\nThink back for a minute to 2020, when George Floyd was killed by police, and the tens of thousands of people on the left who protested despite Covid-19, wrote \"Black Lives Matter\" in the middle of roads, and took over a handful of downtowns in places like Minneapolis and Seattle. Think back to the panicked response by corporations that vowed to do better by black America, revved up their diversity, equity, and inclusion programs, and threw millions of dollars at BLM. Think back to the presidential race, where defunding the police was a top issue.\n\nHere we are now, with DEI programs in retreat, corporations no longer willing to make political statements, and the left more obsessed with Israel than police reform. On the campaign trail, Donald Trump and Kamala Harris compete to be the law-and-order candidate. And BLM four years later? It looks like little more than a hustle.\n\nThe latest proof point came earlier this month when Tyree Conyers-Page-a.k.a. Sir Maejor Page, the 35-year-old former leader of the BLM chapter of Greater Atlanta -was sentenced to 42 months in federal prison for money laundering and wire fraud. Pocketing the $450,000 raised from 18,000 donors to \"fight for George Floyd\" and the \"movement,\" Page spent lavishly on himself, splurging on tailored suits, nightclub bar tabs, an evening with a prostitute , and, as he texted to a friend, \" a big-ass cribo \" that he bought in Ohio after he \"won the lottery.\"\n\nNo posts"

      "text": "Children at a Brooklyn public elementary school are being taught revolutionary politics and communist terms from a Black Lives Matter coloring book, The Free Press has learned.\n\nLast week, teachers at PS 321-the kindergarten through fifth grade school in Park Slope-supplied students with the coloring book, What We Believe , as part of a lesson for Black History Month. The book uses drawings and worksheets to promote the 13 tenets of the Black Lives Matter movement, under titles like \"Queer Affirming,\" \"Transgender Affirming,\" and \"Restorative Justice.\" Principle number 2 , \"Empathy,\" is described as \"engaging comrades with the intent to learn about and connect with their contexts.\"\n\nThe coloring book also lists Black Lives Matter's \"national demands,\" including \"mandate black history & ethnic studies,\" \"hire more black teachers,\" and \"fund counselors not cops.\"\n\nOne parent of a PS 321 fourth grader, whose grandparents fled Communist China before moving to the U.S., said she and her husband were \"shocked\" that the book used the word comrade -and that it appeared to promote political propaganda.\n\n\"Using the word comrades comes from Communist times,\" said the parent, whose 10-year-old daughter attends the school, also known as William Penn. \"They are using words that I don't think are appropriate for elementary school.\"\n\nShe said she first discovered the coloring book on Tuesday, February 13, when a snow day forced her daughter to learn from home.\n\n\"This is classwork, not homework,\" the parent said. \"If it weren't for the snow, we wouldn't have known.\"\n\nLessons in the coloring book tell children to reflect on Black Lives Matter's 13 principles . Some of the exercises, parents said, appear innocuous; a page about \"Restorative Justice,\" for example, asks students: \"Why is it important to offer to forgive someone?\" But another, entitled \"Transgender Affirming,\" instructs students to read the book When Aidan Became a Brother about a girl who transitions to a boy, and then answer questions on a worksheet like, \"How do you feel when someone tells you what you can or can't do based on your gender?\"\n\nAnother principle, \"Black Villages,\" is described as \"disrupting the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure requirement.\" Another, called \"Intergenerational,\" encourages a \"communal network free from ageism.\"\n\nAnother public school parent whose family left the Soviet Union when she was a teenager said the language in the book reminds her \"of the songs we were made to sing as elementary school children. 'Dismantling' and 'comrade' and everything-it really reminds me of the word salad that was a part of those songs.\"\n\nShe compared the Black Lives Matter movement to communism, saying: \"same salad, different dressing.\"\n\nBrandy Shufutinksy, the director of education at the Jewish Institute for Liberal Values, who is black and holds a doctorate in international multicultural education, said she was \"offended\" that the curriculum \"demonizes the nuclear family.\"\n\n\"They frame it as some form of white supremacy,\" Shufutinksy said. \"There are a number of people beside myself who are deeply offended by the idea that black Americans should not strive for something that was denied to our ancestors for so long.\"\n\nThe educational materials used by PS 321 are created by Black Lives Matter at School , an organization founded in 2016 by a group of Seattle teachers to educate students from pre-K to 12th grade about BLM's ideology. In 2018, Black Lives Matter at School launched a national Week of Action in February to teach \"lessons on structural racism, Black history, intersectional Black identities, and anti-racist movements.\" According to the group's website , the curriculum is now taught at a total of 50 schools across 21 states and six countries.\n\nWhen asked for comment from The Free Press , the NYC Department of Education said, \"Anytime parents have a concern about resources used in school, we encourage them to share their concerns to the school principal or district superintendent.\" The principal at PS 321 did not reply to an email seeking comment. Black Lives Matter at School did not respond to multiple emails asking for comment.\n\nSeveral parents who spoke to The Free Press said they were upset that the coloring book failed to teach their children about black history.\n\nOne mother with two children at PS 321 said the coloring book doesn't go \"into enough detail and there is no mention of specific people. It just feels very vague.\"\n\nThe fourth-grade mother said her daughter's teacher told her the coloring book was the only lesson planned for Black History Month, other than a schoolwide project to make a quilt honoring famous black figures. She added that, after the Week of Action, her daughter still had never heard of civil rights hero Rosa Parks and didn't know what Martin Luther King Jr. had achieved to make him famous.\n\nFurthermore, she said, the coloring book presents controversial ideas \"as fact.\" But, \"it's not necessarily true. It's not like every black person believes in these principles.\"\n\nShufutinsky agrees: \"There is nothing in these principles that talks about honoring greats in black American history. There is nothing in here that is actual scholarship. It doesn't speak to education. It speaks to ideology.\"\n\nFrancesca Block is a reporter for The Free Press.

I looked up BLM's website to see what they were all about.  At that point, they still had the text on there about destroying the nuclear family, smashing the heteronormative patriarchy, bringing about the Marxist revolution, etc.. so I was like \"hmmm...maybe not.\"  It was a bit surprising a few years later to see everyone frantically giving them money - do people not investigate the organizations they donate to at all?\n\nWas George Floyd was killed by the Minneapolis police?

Perhaps the people who gave the money had good intentions (or just trying to assuage a sense of guilt), but there is nothing which has been reported which supports the good intentions of the founders of BLM.  A classic case of begging the question.\n\nWhere is the shame? The regret? The call for accountability? The admission of guilt? Where are the voices that call for public confessions by these grifters? How has this scandalous betrayal not hurt the Black Lives Matter vision for black lives?\n\nObama? Kamala? Oprah? Sharpton? Where are you? And for those who have demanded and shamed others into admitting guilt or have extracted a saccharine statement of remorse--and then canceled them in the aftermath--what will you demand of these crooks who took the money? Where are the voices of those aware of the full extent of what happened at BLM Headquarters?\n\n\"a cautionary tale of what happens when people with good intentions are given too much money\".\n\nHardly. More precisely, a repeating tale of when a segment of society continually turns towards race baiters and victim hood salespeople who benefit by not promoting the opportunities for advancement but rather perpetuate the lie that the white man is the oppressor. BLM was easily recognizable as a fraud movement from day one.\n\nI miss Bill Clinton. Abortion should be \"Safe, Legal, and Rare\".\n\nAnd people wonder why so many of us have lost faith in the government.  I think the radical outcomes from Roe v Wade (seriously... who thinks it is ever acceptable to kill a baby on delivery?) tell us that  those of us who value all lives can not trust in Washington to respect us.  When Americans are polled, there is a real belief in limitations to abortions that should be imposed.  I never thought I would witness people saying that they are voting for the right to kill another human being.\n\nAuthor: \"The [BLM] movement is a cautionary tale for what happens when people with good intentions are given too much money.\n\nPeople with good intentions? These self-proclaimed \"trained Marxists\" who denounced white people and police, and, condemning Israel as white oppressors, were a forerunner of the antisemites for Hamas who have flooded and corroded our universities and streets? Leaving aside burning down cities during \"mostly peaceful marches.\"\n\nIs anyone else bothered by the statement \" Instead, the movement is a cautionary tale for what happens when people with good intentions are given too much money.\"? Good intentions? All I'm saying is that the DEI industrial complex and everyone who is part of it sure stands to lose A LOT if we actually solve any DEI problems. Then what happens to those who've made their living wallowing in that problem? Or gotten rich and famous for it? Hm....\n\nSo what exactly were Ruby and Shaye up to anyway?  Because it sure didn't look kosher to me.\n\nNothing to see here is what everyone was told.\n\nI generally find myself on the other side of an issue like this one: but those election workers in Georgia, who wanted nothing more than to do their civic duty and show their gratitude to a great democracy, deserve every penny they get.\n\nI continue to subscribe to this for a variety of reasons but it's stories like \"how BLM blew $90M\" that make we wonder.  Like why give space for this \"story\" given the facts were known almost as soon as ActBlue.org started re-directing donations from kids at my Church that they thought were going to BLM or https://m4bl.org/ in 2020.  This all went down in the summer of love and documented and so what is new in 2024?  What Emily and every other dem author misses, conveniently, is that when kids and bleeding hearts donated back in 2020 because of George Floyd, the fine print on the BLM web donation page (run by ActBlue) clearly noted that \"all, a portion, or none\" (paraphrased) of the donation would go to BLM or m4bl.org .  But who read that fine print?  Who even cared that the jump page for payment was managed by ActBlue?  So about $1B went to ActBlue (dems fundraising) and the URL on the donation page ended in \"/ actblue.com \" and BLM got $90M and Opal and her buddies (\"we're trained Marxists\" they noted on a video) bought houses and paid themselves well.  So the dems raised about $1B off the back of a convicted felon and drug user who was martyred.  That is the story.  I mean how much law-fare \"can\" you do if you have an extra $B sitting around?\n\nEmily Oster?  Seriously?  She is really asking this question?  I've got an answer for you Emily, how about we just declare a general amnesty for parents' child-cellphone-abuse?  Because, hey, back then, when cellphones were becoming popular, we \"just didn't know.\"  Good grief!\n\nYes. Smartphones are stealing childhood. Yes, BLM is much too pro-trans. Here's a better way:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDNnXPaqSaI&t=76s"

      "text": "It's Wednesday, October 23, and this is The Front Page , your daily window into the world of The Free Press -and our take on the world at large. Coming up: Are smartphones stealing childhood?; the Abercrombie & Fitch CEO charged with sex trafficking; plus, legacy media quotes a Municipality of Gaza spokesperson without revealing his likely ties to Hamas. But first, the rise and collapse of Black Lives Matter.\n\nA lot can change in four years. Just ask Kamala Harris, who's walked back various 2019 policies such as a fracking ban and support for Medicare for All . Now she's boasting about owning a Glock . Meanwhile, Democrats have forgotten they ever uttered the words \" defund the police .\" But perhaps the most vivid example of how we're not in 2020 anymore-and that the vibes have most definitely shifted-is the fall of Black Lives Matter. In 2020, after George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police, the movement took on quasi-religious status, with chapters raising $90 million in one year . Today, the BLM brand is widely recognized as a scam that lost $6.2 million in the last fiscal year.\n\nEarlier this month, Tyree Conyers-Page-a.k.a. Sir Maejor Page-the 35-year-old former leader of the BLM chapter for Greater Atlanta , was sentenced to 42 months in federal prison for money laundering and wire fraud. Instead of spending the $450,000 raised from 18,000 donors to \"fight for George Floyd,\" Page splurged on tailored suits, nightclub bar tabs, an evening with a prostitute and, as he texted to a friend, \" a big-ass \" mansion in Ohio.\n\nPage is not an outlier. Take Melina Abdullah, co-director of BLM Grassroots, who media reports accuse of using the organization's money to pay for vacations to Jamaica and her own personal expenses. Though Abdullah has not been charged with a crime, California's attorney general has threatened to revoke her organization's tax-exempt status if she fails to turn over its delinquent tax filings and late fees by Sunday.\n\n\"Abdullah has denied the allegations, but at least $8.7 million in donations is unaccounted for,\" writes investigative reporter Sean Patrick Cooper in his first piece for The Free Press . \"The answer to where the money went may come soon.\"\n\n\"Maybe,\" Sean concludes, \"if the founders had been as committed to social justice as to enriching themselves, BLM could have enjoyed a long life as a progressive institution.\" Instead, the movement is a cautionary tale for what happens when people with good intentions are given too much money. Read Sean Patrick Cooper on how BLM misspent millions of dollars .\n\nWhy Is The New York Times Not Disclosing a Source's Ties to Hamas?\n\nOn the first anniversary of the October 7, 2023 massacre, The New York Times published an episode of its flagship podcast, The Daily , featuring two men on opposite sides of the war in Gaza. The first was an Israeli man, Golan Abitbul, who's described as a \"liberal\" 44-year-old father from Kibbutz Be'eri. The second was \"Hussein,\" cast as a Palestinian man struggling for survival, whose identity was shrouded in secrecy.\n\nIn the episode, Hussein speaks of Israel \"imposing collective punishment on over two million people with no reason.\" The podcast's host, Sabrina Tavernise, doesn't think to drill down on that, nor to ask why he has an unusually \"good income\" that enables him to pay $1,000 a month in rent.\n\nIt turns out that Hussein is Hussein Owda, who spent eight years working as the head of public relations for the Municipality of Gaza, which multiple sources told Olivia Reingold is controlled by Hamas. \"Every government structure in Gaza was run by Hamas,\" Jon Schanzer, a former terrorism analyst at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, told Olivia. Schanzer added that Owda, as the former head of public relations for the municipality, likely was \"providing propaganda\" to advance Hamas's mission.\n\nNone of this means Owda is an actual terrorist. Some employees are just trying to \"put food on the table for their families,\" Schanzer told Olivia. And perhaps Owda is one of those people. Yet for the past decade, he has been employed by entities linked to Hamas-including a nonprofit with close ties to the Muslim Brotherhood and now UNRWA, the UN aid agency with suspected ties to Hamas. That ambiguity is why, Schanzer said, all cards should be laid out for the reader.\n\n\"Just saying he's a municipal worker in this context? It's almost glib,\" Schanzer said. \"Not mentioning his connection to Hamas at all? Now that's a problem.\"\n\nThe New York Times has quoted Owda four separate times, citing his work for UNRWA twice but revealing no other affiliations. Read Olivia Reingold's piece about NYT's failure to reveal a source's troubling connections .\n\nIn Episode Six of Raising Parents , Emily Oster Asks: Are Smartphones Stealing Childhood?\n\nKids today are digital natives. Increasingly, it seems like their first word after mama and dada is iPhone . Parents may feel uncomfortable giving their children a small supercomputer, but they often cave to social pressure. By the time the average American child is 10, more than 40 percent of their peers own a smartphone. By age 12, that figure is 70 percent. And by age 14, it's over 90 percent. Meanwhile, nearly 50 percent of teenagers say they use their phones \"almost constantly.\"\n\nIn the latest episode of Raising Parents , Emily Oster explores how much smartphones are harming children's social lives, cognitive development, and physical and mental health. And, she asks, who should we trust to put things right: parents, schools-or even the government?\n\nClick play below, or subscribe wherever you get your podcasts, to listen to Emily Oster unpack all this and more.\n\nOn Tuesday, South Korea said it is considering sending weapons to Ukraine , in response to its spy agency's estimation that North Korea has already sent at least 1,500 troops to Russia. Seoul says the North Korean troops are being trained to fight in Ukraine. The possibility of South Korean weapons being used against North Korean troops in a war in Europe has an uncomfortably \"World War III\" feel to it.\n\nFor years, British and American forces have had to rely on multimillion-dollar missiles to take out drones launched by Houthi rebels in the Red Sea. But it's not \"economically sustainable to shoot down a $100 or $1,000 drone with a $1mm plus interceptor,\" a defense researcher told the Financial Times. Instead, Western governments are hoping to deploy more cost-effective laser technology to defeat drones by 2027. Major defense contractors across Europe and America, including RTX, MBDA, and QinetiQ, are rushing to develop drone-destroying technology.\n\nImagine having to bribe your own dad. On Tuesday, an Orange County supervisor in California pleaded guilty to accepting over half a million dollars in bribes-in exchange for directing $10 million to a charity associated with his daughter. The funds were originally supposed to go toward feeding the elderly during the Covid pandemic. Instead, they went to Viet America Society (VAS) , which the supervisor's daughter Rhiannon Do then used to buy a $1 million home.\n\nThe latest, and final, Atlanta Constitution-Journal poll of Georgia finds that Donald Trump has a 47 to 43 percent lead over Kamala Harris in the crucial state. It's a small but meaningful lead, just outside the poll's 3.1 percent margin of error. But perhaps the most interesting number in the survey is the 8 percent of voters who say that, with under two weeks to go, they still haven't made up their minds.\n\nIt is presumably these kinds of undecided voters to whom Trump hopes to appeal with an appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast this week. According to a Trump campaign official, the former president will tape an episode of the show-which has more than 17 million subscribers on YouTube and 14 million on Spotify-on Friday. President Trump, if you're reading this, it's not too late to come on Honestly . Drop us a line: tips@thefp.com . Bari promises to keep it under eight hours and won't ask you whether you think aliens built the pyramids.\n\nA special Free Press shout-out to the voter who, at the start of a Harris campaign town hall event in Michigan on Monday, asked : \"Are we going to be able to ask a question?\" We admire the questioner's quixotic faith in American democracy. Host Maria Shriver had to explain that only prescreened questions were on the slate for the night. \"Hopefully I'll be able to ask some of the questions that might be in your head,\" Shriver added.\n\nRemember when Abercrombie & Fitch had Shirtless Guys outside every store? Remember the guy who conceived that idea? Mike Jeffries stepped down as CEO in 2014, but now he is back in the spotlight-and not in a good way. Yesterday, he was arrested and charged with sex trafficking and 15 counts of interstate prostitution, after the culmination of a yearlong FBI investigation into allegations he sexually abused multiple young male models between 2009 and 2015 at \"sex parties\" everywhere from Morocco to the Caribbean. Attendees were allegedly told that participating in the parties would lead to modeling opportunities and that not complying \"could harm their careers.\" Jeffries also allegedly paid an exclusive household staff to \"facilitate and supervise the sex events,\" giving partygoers alcohol, muscle relaxants, Viagra, and condoms. It's all falling a bit short of the company's mission , which partly states that it is \"committed to quality\" and \"authentic goodness.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, a federal judge ordered former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani to hand over his Manhattan penthouse and other valuable possessions to Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, two Georgia election workers he defamed-and to whom he now owes $150 million. The possessions Giuliani had to part with included a collection of watches, some of which were given to him by European presidents after 9/11, as well as a Mercedes once owned by Lauren Bacall. How much does a 9/11 watch go for on eBay?\n\nMadeleine Kearns is an associate editor for The Free Press.

      "text": "Four decades ago, Glenn C. Loury became the first tenured black professor of economics in Harvard's history. Ever since then, he has made waves for his willingness to buck the elite intellectual establishment; for his iconoclastic ideas about race and inequality; and for his incisive cultural criticism .\n\nHe is a man of many apparent contradictions: he rails against the divisiveness of woke politics from his post as the Merton P. Stoltz Professor of the Social Sciences and Professor of Economics Brown University, one of America's most left wing campuses. He worries about what the death of God means for the country - though he calls his own past religious beliefs a \"benevolent self-delusion,\" even as he admits they saved his life. In the '80s, Glenn challenged his fellow black Americans to combat the \"enemy from within,\" while he himself battled personal demons like addiction.\n\nFor my part, I think Glenn embodies what the philosophers call a man in full. Glenn is a man who, in a time of lies told for the sake of political convenience, strives to tell the truth even when the truth is hard. Or complicated. Or an affront to our feelings. Or contradicts what we wish were true.\n\nOn today's episode of Honestly we discuss: race, racism, Black Lives Matter, George Floyd, Tony Timpa, school choice, standardized tests, crack, sexual infidelity, Christianity, the Nation of Islam, neoconservatism, and pretty much every other hot-button subject you can imagine.\n\nPlus, Glenn's own remarkable life story and what it says about America.\n\nBelow are some of the highlights from our conversation, edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nOn being the skunk at the garden party:\n\nBW: Two years after you got to Harvard, in 1984, you published an explosive essay in The New Republic called \"A New American Dilemma.\" In it, you wrote \"the social disorganization among poor blacks, the lagging academic performance of black students, the disturbingly high rate of black on black crime, the alarming increase in the early unwed pregnancies among blacks now loom as the primary obstacles to progress.\"\n\nGL: Yeah.\n\nBW: I want to hear about the decision to publish that piece.\n\nGL: Bari, that almost made chills run down my spine. Remembering those words, those years and the whole thing that led up to it. I made Coretta Scott King weep in a meeting of the urban coalition leaders and civil rights leaders in Washington, D.C. the summer before that essay was published. That essay comes out of my years at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor when I would go into Detroit a great deal. And I was seeing what was happening to Detroit in the late 70s and early 80s. And it also came out of my work in my dissertation, in which I addressed the post-civil rights dispensation and whether the disparity would narrow in the face of equal opportunity. It was very much influenced by Daniel Patrick Moynihan. So there was all this talk in the air. And in that meeting where Coretta, the great widow of the iconic figure, Martin Luther King Jr., wept, I was invited to give a précis of this essay and to hear from civil rights leaders in response before it was published.\n\nBW: Did it feel like you were saying something out loud and in public that many people you knew and probably many people you grew up with believed, but it just wasn't allowed to be said out loud at a place like Harvard?\n\nGL: I don't want to get too partisan about it, but I just want to say I don't think the people around that table who led those organizations were like: \"Yeah, I agree with you. That's the problem. But we can't say it that way.\" I think they were more like: \"That's not how we talk. That's reactionary talk that gives aid and comfort to the enemy. We expected better of you than that.\" That's why I think Mrs. King was weeping. At the end of the day, I was standing right next to her. We're only about 20 people in the room. And I'm standing up extemporaneously giving a 20 or 30 minute exposition. And I looked down and there are tears rolling down her cheek. And I think it was a disappointment. You know, I am this wunderkind, I'm 34 years old and I'm a tenured professor of economics at Harvard. I have all that cache. And there I am. That's my message. That's what I have to say.\n\nOn the state of American universities:\n\nBW: You've been on campus for several decades now and you're now at Brown, which has a reputation of being, for lack of a better word, one of the most \"woke\" campuses in the country. What changes have you seen on campus since the time that you began teaching at Harvard to what you're seeing at Brown today?\n\nGL: My, that's a very large question, which I'm loath to answer off the cuff. I think standards have gone down. You ask me, I'm going to tell you. I think, for example, in math education we're not serious. We in the United States of America are losing our edge. When I speak to one of my classes, if I do anything, that's the least bit demanding of abstract, analytical, logical framing, I'm looking at their faces and I'm made to dumb down, in effect, what I want to say. I'm not doing this subject justice, but I don't think we expect as much of our students. I don't think we demand as much. Grade inflation is a horrible corruption.\n\nBW: To what extent do you connect the decline in standards to the fact that schools are effectively now a political monoculture? Is there something about not being around other people with worldviews that are radically different from your own and being forced to contend with them? Does that make people stupider and perhaps lazier?\n\nGL: I think it sounds correct to me. I don't know if that accounts for the fact that if I write an equation on the blackboard during a lecture to undergraduates at Brown, a third of the class eyes will glaze over. I don't know if I can draw the direct connection there, but groupthink is the enemy of rigor. I think that's a defensible place to take a stand. So one of the things that I think has happened is that our standards have lowered. Now, another thing that has happened is that I think we're in the service of various believed-to-be-certainties about moral issues. We feel that we need to signal solidarity with them through the work of the university, through its research, through its teaching, its pedagogy, through its composition of its incumbent members and how we select and what we define to be excellence and all that. That has become captive to a certain political agenda. I mean, it's left. It's definitely left. We could go into it. And if I get specific, then I'll be written off as a reactionary.\n\nBW: I'd like for you to get specific.\n\nGL: The diversity thing is going to be one of the things that I'm going to say. The hostility to American interest in the world is another thing that I could point to. The impatience with the fact that when you transform moral judgments about things like gender identity overnight in a country of 330 million people, where everybody is not going to be on the same page at the same time, and the way you decide to talk about that from some lofty, supercilious, self-righteous, sanctimonious moral posture and to condemn the people who are holding their bibles or holding on to their traditions as if they were know-nothings. That smugness infects the university. But I think the diversity thing is related to the standards thing.\n\nSo I'm just going to say this: You can't do affirmative action, maintain black dignity, and maintain the standards at the same time. That's a trilemma, you can't do all of those things at the same time, if you lower the standards for black people to admit them to elite venues of intellectual performance and the standards are correlated with performance, you assure as a statistical necessity, on average, lower performance of the blacks whom you've admitted. If you insist on their dignity, you can't be Sandra Sellers . This is the adjunct lecturer at Georgetown Law Center who was caught on an open mic lamenting the fact that most of the kids in her class who were at the bottom were black.\n\nBW: And she was fired and the person listening to it left.\n\nGL: And the whole brouhaha, the whole navel-gazing conflagration that happened at the institution of Georgetown Law with a black faculty demand of the white faculty that they acknowledge their white supremacist, blah, blah, blah. It's all a cover for black mediocrity. Yes. There, I said it. You lowered the standards. Now the black kids are at the bottom, but they have to have dignity. Therefore, you immolate yourself morally. That is a disease in the university. I'm going to say it one more time: Black equality cannot be had in this way.\n\nBW: What do you mean when you say \" immolate yourself morally\"?\n\nGL: What I mean is they're now going to search under every bed for racist white people. Do you know that the grades of Sandra Sellers' previous classes were audited by the law school to see whether she exhibited unfairness to black students?\n\nBW: So let me say back to you what I'm hearing: there needs to be some explanation for disparity beyond the academic proclivities or talents of the students. And so in order to explain that disparity, racism needs to be found.\n\nGL: Yeah, that is what I'm saying. Reporting the existence of the disparity is ipso facto racist in the minds of these people.\n\nOn what a movement for black lives should look like:\n\nBW: The word racism has been redefined, particularly by Ibram X. Kendi. First of all, it's no longer about personal bigotry. It's about any system that results in disparity. So if you have any kind of disparity between racial groups in any given institution, school culture system, it is evidence in and of itself that racism is present.\n\nGL: That is exactly what Kendi is saying. He's not mincing words about it. What it brings to mind is George Orwell's essay \"Politics and the English Language,\" in which he talks about how words and the meaning of words fall in the service of political programs. And people think they can make reality by playing with words. I don't know why anybody takes Ibram X. Kendi seriously. That's a silly book, \"How To Be an Anti-Racist.\" Kendi's formulations are sophomoric. They don't bear up under the least bit of serious, rigorous social scientific scrutiny. He's not standing on any literature. He's not citing any intellectual development that has any deep roots in anything. It's pablum. It's froth on the intellectual surface of our life. And it behooves us all to think pretty hard about why it is that we're content with that kind of analysis. When civil disorder in American cities is consuming the lives of black people like a machine, our political leaders and intellectual class and journalistic representatives haven't got a word to say about it. Black Lives Matter is almost completely irrelevant to what matters in black lives.\n\nBW: And yet corporations and the entire elite establishment has taken up the cause of Black Lives Matter. And the cynic in me would say it's just about the cheapest and easiest thing that they could possibly do.\n\nGL: Nothing that Black Lives Matter is about has any intersection with the things that actually matter in black lives. What about education? The gap in the cognitive development of the human potential of African-American youngsters relative to others in this country widens. It's a yawning chasm.\n\nBW: Glenn, if one really cared about black lives and wanted to insist on a movement that actually fulfilled the promise of black lives mattering, what would be the top three priorities of that movement?\n\nGL: I think self-determination and taking responsibility for our lives. I'd say education. I'm sorry this is partisan, but the public-school unions are poorly serving, on the whole, the places where black students congregate and the intellectual needs of those students. Now, there are other people to be faulted as well. But opening up that system to innovation is absolutely imperative to improving the quality of black life in this country.\n\nAnd the public safety piece of this narrative, that the police are out to get black people, this contempt for law, the lawlessness of the George Floyd protests, the celebration of that lawlessness, the silence in the face of it. Patriotism. And by that I don't mean blind loyalty to a flag salute, I mean seeing yourself as an integral part of the American project. This is our country. We don't stand off from it. There is no United Nations where black claims will be negotiated. We must make our peace with our fellow citizens. That has corollaries: two national anthems is a terrible idea, reparations for slavery is a mistake. It wrongly places the nature of the moral problem. It creates these parties as between which a negotiation and a deal is being cut. There are not two parties here. There's only one party.\n\nOn partisan race-baiting:\n\nBW: There was an incident recently surrounding Larry Elder's campaign during the recall. And the first was when the L.A. Times called Larry Elder the \"black face of white supremacy.\"\n\nGL: I saw it.\n\nBW : He was campaigning in Los Angeles right before the vote. And a white woman wearing a gorilla mask came up to him and was screaming, throwing eggs at him, trying to hit him I think. And this went almost ignored by the mainstream press. Whereas in the notorious Central Park Karen case , there were almost two dozen stories about that incident in The New York Times. And yet here a black politician is being harassed by a woman in a gorilla mask . . .\n\nGL: Why is it not an unacceptably racist political act to caricature Larry Elder in that way and to assault him? I'm sorry, I think many of us black people are not fools. I mean, this is not a plantation. You can't tell me what I'm supposed to think. Larry Elder is a conservative. I'm not advocating for him here. I'm just saying to use his race in that way, as the Los Angeles Times did, that's unspeakable. That's despicable.\n\nBW: Is that because he's just not the right kind of black man or the right kind of black politician?\n\nGL: OK, now you're asking a partisan. I'm critical of the Democratic Party's use of race in its larger political strategy, which relies on keeping black people afraid of racism. The idea that black people need to be afraid of the police. I think that's absurd. I think it's madness that with 330 million people in the country, with 40 million black people in the country, we've got dozens of cities with 500,000 people in them with large urban areas. There are tens of thousands of encounters between the police and citizens on a daily basis. You've got a handful of incidents of the George Floyd variety, and even many of those are ambiguous. So you construe that as open season on black people when, in fact, homicide is through the roof.\n\nBW: And yet when I watched the video of George Floyd, and when I watched the passion and rage of that summer, I was shaken by it. I watched that video and thought: How the hell could this be happening in America right now? Maybe I was taken by what Shelby Steele said. That is, the poetic truth of it. And maybe that's one explanation for why something like that goes so viral. That it represents, maybe in our collective consciousness, the truth about the fundamentally racist history of America. What do you think of that?\n\nGL: Well, I think Shelby does make that point in reference to Michael Brown. Poetic truth. I think that's a very brilliant way of putting it. He has a point that reading these events in a particular way resonates with a larger narrative about American society that feels true to many people. I would point out that for every George Floyd type situation, there's a Tony Timpa type situation. This is a white guy who got similarly abused by police officers under similar circumstances. The numbers say that it happens to white people, too. So we have to choose to read what happened to George Floyd as a racial matter. We're choosing to interpret it that way. To say that that's a reenactment of Emmett Till, that's a choice we're making.\n\nI could go down the litany of evidence to the effect that the race-relations situation in America in the 21st century is completely and radically different and improved relative to what it was in the mid 20th century. And I think we have to begin to entertain a possibility, which is that the actual success of American history, the fact that we overcame the warts, is the problem. Because the fact of that success in the face of the continuing failure of a large chunk of black society to get on the escalator of opportunity, which defines this country, is just too much cognitive dissonance for a lot of people to grapple with. It's the presidency of Barack Hussein Obama. It's the fact that black women are the mayors of a half dozen big cities that I could name. It's the fact that there are black billionaires. That Oprah Winfrey is Oprah Winfrey and that LeBron James is LeBron James. It's the fact that every corporate office has an Ibram X. Kendi-loving executive running it. These are the realities of America. Now, in the face of that, you still got jails overflowing with black people. You've still got massive poverty and disparity. People do not know the goal in the 21st century with those facts. So they end up, like infants, throwing tantrums in the corner.\n\nIf you missed our subscriber-only event with Abigail Shrier, you can listen to it here .

      "text": "If you are a devoted reader of Common Sense, by now you have surely noticed a trend: workplaces-in some cases, storied institutions-that turn hostile to independent thinking seemingly overnight.\n\nThat's what Paul Rossi experienced at Grace Church School. It's what Jennifer Sey went through at Levi's. It's what Antonio García Martínez dealt with at Apple. And Roland Fryer at Harvard. And Gordon Klein at UCLA. And Maud Maron at Legal Aid.\n\nNow comes the story of Zac Kriegman, who, until not so long ago, was a director of data science at Thomson Reuters. Kriegman's crime? Questioning the Black Lives Matter narrative.\n\nKriegman is a person who loves numbers and statistics. As you'll read below, he didn't just voice an opinion to his colleagues. He made an argument after having done extensive research. He thought logic would win out. He was wrong.\n\nThis story is most obviously about the assault on difference. The assault on the notion, previously taken for granted, that you shouldn't punish employees for having heterodox opinions or for voicing disagreement with the political consensus in an organization. But it is also about the assault on reason itself. - BW\n\nCommon Sense is a reader-supported publication. If you appreciate our work, please become a subscriber today.\n\nUntil recently, I was a director of data science at Thomson Reuters, one of the biggest news organizations in the world. It was my job, among other things, to sift through reams of numbers and figure out what they meant.\n\nAbout a year ago, I stumbled on a really big story. It was about black Americans being gunned down across the country and the ways in which we report on that violence. We had been talking nonstop about race and police brutality, and I thought: This is a story that could save lives. This is a story that has to be told.\n\nBut when I shared the story with my coworkers, my boss chastised me, telling me expressing this opinion could limit my ability to take on leadership roles within the company. Then I was maligned by my colleagues. And then I was fired.\n\nThis is the story Reuters didn't want to tell.\n\nI had been at Thomson Reuters for over six years-most recently, leading a team of data scientists applying new machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms to our legal, tax and news data. We advised any number of divisions inside the company, including Westlaw, an online legal research service used by most every law firm in the country, and the newsroom, which reaches an audience of one billion every day around the globe. I briefed the Chief Technology Officer regularly. My total annual compensation package exceeded $350,000.\n\nIn 2020, I started to witness the spread of a new ideology inside the company. On our internal collaboration platform, the Hub, people would post about \"the self-indulgent tears of white women\" and the danger of \"White Privilege glasses.\" They'd share articles with titles like \"Seeing White,\" \"Habits of Whiteness\" and \"How to Be a Better White Person.\" There was fervent and vocal support for Black Lives Matter at every level of the company. No one challenged the racial essentialism or the groupthink.\n\nThis concerned me. I had been following the academic research on BLM for years (for example, here , here , here and here ), and I had come to the conclusion that the claim upon which the whole movement rested-that police more readily shoot black people-was false.\n\nThe data was unequivocal. It showed that, if anything, police were slightly less likely to use lethal force against black suspects than white ones.\n\nStatistics from the most complete database of police shootings (compiled by The Washington Post) indicate that, over the last five years, police have fatally shot 39 percent more unarmed whites than blacks. Because there are roughly six times as many white Americans as black Americans, that figure should be closer to 600 percent, BLM activists (and their allies in legacy media ) insist. The fact that it's not-that there's more than a 500-percentage point gap between reality and expectation-is, they say, evidence of the bias of police departments across the United States.\n\nBut it's more complicated than that. Police are authorized to use lethal force only when they believe a suspect poses a grave danger of harming others. So, when it comes to measuring cops' racial attitudes, it's important that we compare apples and apples: Black suspects who pose a grave danger and white suspects who do the same.\n\nUnfortunately, we don't have reliable data on the racial makeup of dangerous suspects, but we do have a good proxy: The number of people in each group who murder police officers.\n\nAccording to calculations (published by Patrick Frey, Deputy District Attorney for Los Angeles County) based on FBI data , black Americans account for 37 percent of those who murder police officers, and 34 percent of the unarmed suspects killed by police. Meanwhile, whites make up 42.7 percent of cop killers and 42 percent of the unarmed suspects shot by police-meaning whites are killed by police at a 7 percent higher rate than blacks.\n\nIf you broaden the analysis to include armed suspects, the gap is even wider, with whites shot at a 70 percent higher rate than blacks. Other experts in the field concur that, in relation to the number of police officers murdered, whites are shot disproportionately.\n\nThere has been only one study that has looked at the rate at which police use lethal force in similar circumstances across racial groups. It was conducted by the wunderkind Harvard economist Roland Fryer, who is black, grew up poor, had his fair share of run-ins with the police and, initially, supported BLM. In 2016, Fryer, hoping to prove the BLM narrative, conducted a rigorous study that controlled for the circumstances of shootings-and was shocked to find that, while blacks and Latinos were likelier than whites to experience some level of police force, they were, if anything, slightly less likely to be shot. The study generated enormous controversy. (In 2018, Fryer was suspended from Harvard over dubious allegations of sexual harassment.)\n\nUnfortunately, because the BLM narrative was now conventional wisdom, police departments, under intense scrutiny from left-wing politicians and activists, scaled back patrols in dangerous neighborhoods filled with vulnerable black residents. This led to soaring violence in many communities and thousands of needless deaths-otherwise known as the Ferguson Effect.\n\nFor many months I stayed silent. I continued to read Reuters' reporting on the movement, and started to see how the company's misguided worldview about policing and racism was distorting the way we were reporting news stories to the public.\n\nIn one story , Reuters reported on police in Kenosha, Wisconsin shooting a black man, Jacob Blake, in the back-but failed to mention that they did so only after he grabbed a knife and looked likely to lunge at them.\n\nIn another story , Reuters referred \"to a wave of killings of African-Americans by police using unjustified lethal force,\" despite a lack of statistical evidence that such a wave of police killings had taken place. (In 2020, 18 unarmed black Americans were killed by police, according to The Washington Post database.)\n\nAnd in yet another , Reuters referred to the shooting of Michael Brown as one of a number of \"egregious examples of lethal police violence,\" despite the fact that an investigation conducted by the Justice Department-then run by Barack Obama's Attorney General Eric Holder-had cleared the police officer in question of all wrongdoing.\n\nA pattern was starting to emerge: Reporters and editors would omit key details that undermined the BLM narrative. More important than reporting accurately was upholding-nurturing-that storyline.\n\nAt some point, the organization went from ignoring key facts to just reporting lies. When Donald Trump declared, in July 2020, that the police kill more white than black people-this is true-Reuters, in its dispatch, repeated the false claim that blacks \"are shot at a disproportionate rate.\" In December 2020, Reuters reported that black Americans \"are more likely to be killed by police,\" citing a 2019 National Academy of Sciences study that, our reporters claimed, found that black men were 2.5 times likelier than white men to be killed by police. In fact, the only rigorous study to examine the likelihood of police use of force-Roland Fryer's-found that police, as mentioned, were less likely to use lethal force against black Americans.\n\nAll this left me deeply unsettled: It was bad for Reuters, which was supposed to be objective and withhold judgment. It was bad for our readers, who were being misinformed. And it was bad for black people in rough neighborhoods, where local officials, prompted to take action by reporting like ours and the public outcry it triggered, were doing things like defunding the police.\n\nReuters, which is headquartered in London, is hardly the biggest news organization in the United States, but its stories are published in newspapers across the country and read by millions of Americans. It influences our perception of reality. It matters . I didn't know what to do. I thought I should speak up, but I wanted to preserve my career. My wife, Cynthia, and I started arguing. I'd stay up late into the night compulsively reading the news and studies about policing. I took a two-month leave of absence while I agonized over what to do.\n\nWhile I was gone, I started writing a post about the disconnect between what we thought was true and what was actually happening. I wasn't sure what I planned to do with it. Maybe I would share it. More likely it would just be a kind of therapy, a chance for me to work through some of these issues.\n\nIn my post, I examined all the data I had compiled, and I cited the Justice Department's National Crime Victimization Survey and several academic studies (see, for example, here , here , here and here ) to help back up my conclusions-in addition to Fryer's.\n\nI also pointed out that there had been zero properly designed studies refuting Fryer's findings. And I noted that a growing number of criminologists-like Paul Cassell, at the University of Utah; Lawrence Rosenthal, at Chapman University; and Richard Rosenfeld, at the University of Missouri-St. Louis-now believed that the false rhetoric around police bias had played a key role in the recent spike in violent crime. This suggested that the BLM lie had led to the murder of thousands of black people.\n\nTo drive home my point, I included this striking statistic: On an average year, 18 unarmed black people and 26 unarmed white people are shot by police. By contrast, roughly 10,000 black people are murdered annually by criminals in their own neighborhoods.\n\nWhen I returned from my leave of absence, I was ready to post my summary to the Hub, where my colleagues regularly posted things about any number of hot-button issues. Cynthia wasn't sure. She wasn't just worried about my job, but also about her job, and she was worried that word would get out to the rest of our community. BLM lawn signs lined our street. Our friends sympathized with the cause. We wondered whether we'd be ostracized. We spent many hours over many weeks talking it through. I had come close to posting and then pulled back, and then again, and again. We were talking about it in couples therapy. Finally, I got the okay from Cynthia to publish. She understood that this was about me speaking freely and honestly about something I knew about, cared about and felt I had the responsibility to do something about. I took a deep breath and shared my post on the Hub. It was early May 2021.\n\nWithin an hour or two, the moderators had taken down my post.\n\nI messaged my Human Resources contact to inquire why my post had been removed. She told me anyone could flag a post for review, at which point it would be immediately taken down. She didn't say anything else. I had no idea who had objected or what the grounds for the objection were, or when, if ever, my post would be reinstated.\n\nOver the next two weeks, I kept checking back with her to see when they would reinstate it. After a good bit of waiting and wondering, she told me that \"a team of human resources and communications professionals\" was reviewing it. I asked if I'd be allowed to discuss the moderators' concerns with them. She said no. Finally, she told me my post would not be reinstated because it had been deemed \"antagonistic\" and \"provocative.\"\n\nWhen I asked what, exactly, was antagonistic or provocative, she suggested I speak with the Head of Diversity and Inclusion. So, I scheduled a meeting.\n\nI should mention that, while this was going on with H.R., I met with my manager, who expressed surprise and concern that I had written and then shared my post. It could hurt me at the company, she said. It could put the kibosh on any future promotions.\n\nThe next week, I met with the Head of Diversity and Inclusion. I asked what was wrong with my post. She said she couldn't tell me, because she hadn't been involved in the decision to remove it. (I was unclear whether she'd actually read it.)\n\nThe next week, there was another meeting-this time with H.R. and Diversity and Inclusion. I wanted to know what I had to change in my post to make it acceptable. They suggested scrubbing all instances of the term \"systemic racism,\" to start.\n\nSo I did that, and the piece was reinstated. I was relieved. Such discussion about facts and statistics had to be permitted. It was impossible to report the news accurately if employees were not allowed to have internal, sometimes heated discussions about pretty much anything.\n\nThen the comments started rolling in. A handful of BLM supporters, all of them white, said that, as a white person, I had no place criticizing BLM. They called my review of the academic literature \"whitesplaining\" (failing to note that many of the academics I cited were black). I was publicly derided as a \"troll,\" \"confused,\" \"laughable,\" and \"not worth engaging with or even attempting to have an intelligent conversation\" with. One colleague said: \"I do not believe that there is any point in trying to engage in a blow-by-blow refutation of your argument, and I will not do so. My unwillingness to do so doesn't signal the strength of your argument. If someone says, 'The KKK did lots of good things for the community-prove me wrong,' I'm not obligated to do so.\"\n\nNotably absent from the attacks directed at me was even a single substantive challenge to the facts I was citing.\n\nIt was insulting and painful. Not a single executive, no one in H.R., no one in Diversity and Inclusion, condemned any of the public attacks on me. They were silent. I'm not surprised no one came to my defense. Who would take that kind of a risk? It became very clear very fast that my public takedown was intended to ensure that there would be no discussion around BLM or the question of police brutality and race.\n\nAfter enduring waves of abuse, I emailed H.R. to express my concern about these attacks on me and their chilling effect. They responded by removing my post-and shutting down the conversation. I was told that, if I discussed my experience on any internal company communications channel, I would be fired.\n\nI was distraught.  Here I was trying to bring the company's attention to how we were spreading lies that were contributing to the murders of thousands of black people, and I was compared to a Klansman sympathizer, and forbidden by the company to discuss any of it.\n\nI had little doubt about the sincerity of H.R.'s threat to fire me.  But I still had a faint hope that the company's senior leadership would right the ship if I could only make them aware of the matter.  Regardless, given the way the internal conversation had ended, I didn't see a tenable way to continue working at the company without some sort of resolution.\n\nSo, I sent an email to colleagues and company leadership , again expressing concern about how the attacks against me had successfully shut down any productive conversation and left my reputation in tatters. The next day, H.R. called me to say that my access to all company computer and communications systems had been revoked.\n\nThree days later, on June 8, 2021, I was fired.\n\n\"As we discussed on Friday,\" H.R. said in their parting email, \"you've violated our expressed direction and have repeatedly refused to follow the counsel offered.\" The email went on:\"The manner in which you've conducted yourself in recent weeks does not align with our expectations for you as a leader within Thomson Reuters.\"\n\nA decade ago, my experience at Thomson Reuters would have been unthinkable. Most Americans probably think it's still unthinkable. That's what makes it so dangerous. Most of us don't understand how deeply compromised our news sources have become. Most of us have no idea that we are suffused with fictions and half-truths that sound sort of believable and are shielded from scrutiny by people whose job is to challenge them. This is true, above all, of my fellow liberals, who assume that only Republicans complain about the mainstream media. But this is not a partisan issue. This is a We The People issue.\n\nIn January, I filed a complaint with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination stating that I was fired in retaliation for complaining about a racially hostile work environment. (The MCAD works in conjunction with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.) We'll see whether the state finds that there are grounds for a lawsuit.\n\nHowever that shakes out will not change the fact that thousands of black Americans are dead, in part because too many people are still unaware of basic facts about policing since their trusted news sources meticulously obscure the truth. The job of journalists is to report the stories that don't comport with the prevailing or popular narrative. We desperately need them to do that again.\n\n\"Here I was trying to bring the company's attention to how we were spreading lies that were contributing to the murders of thousands of black people, \"\n\n-Yeah.....don't think that was your primary concern/motivation.\n\nA horde isn't capable of intellectual courage, just blunt trauma. Onward, sir! Good luck in getting the courts to uncover the truth.\n\nNo posts"

      "text": "As well as being a brilliant essayist, Freddie deBoer is a Marxist and a left-wing organizer. He is, in other words, a proper lefty-someone who understands progressivism from the inside.\n\nThat familiarity is exactly what makes Freddie-whose name perhaps you'll remember from his appearance on Honestly -one of the most incisive critics of the contemporary left in America today. He thinks the movement has drifted too far from its core values, focusing on elite preoccupations like identity politics rather than the well-being of working-class Americans.\n\nIn his new book, How Elites Ate the Social Justice Movement , Freddie tackles a riddle: why, given the seeming popularity of left-wing causes like Black Lives Matter and #MeToo, has the American left achieved so little? How have the goals and ideals that made Freddie a progressive become so far removed from today's mainstream left?\n\nAs well as diagnosing the problem, Freddie also offers some solutions. In this essay, adapted from his book, he offers his fellow progressives some advice. -BW\n\nI'm a Marxist. Though I'm a fairly unorthodox one at this point, I would still love to see a Marxist revolution. You know, an international movement of workers rising up and taking control of political and economic systems, and distributing resources and labor based on need, while organized under the principle of shared ownership of the productive apparatus of society.\n\nBut with American progressivism focused on identity politics, not class interests, forever wandering from the righteous to the ridiculous, this appears to be an unrealistic dream. So I'm left to settle for a set of lefty policy preferences that I can live with-a child tax credit, far more muscular laws protecting labor organizing, single-payer health insurance, reparations for slavery, and so on.\n\nAnyone can put together their list of preferred policies. But there is little point in doing so given the ways in which the left has lost its way. Before we can debate the merits of specific proposals, progressives must break some of the bad habits that have got us into this mess. Here's where to start.\n\nTake Opportunities for Solidarity Where You Find Them\n\nLately, it's become the fashion to declare that cisgender white gay men are not part of the LGBTQ+ community. They are, apparently, too laden with privilege to be considered part of the coalition of the noble suffering.\n\nThat sort of thinking is permanently alien to me, so I can't comment on the moral logic at play. But politically it's suicidal; there are millions of cisgender white gay men, they're disproportionately well-connected in politics (yes, thanks to racism and sexism), and they played an outsize role in the fight for gay marriage, one of the most stunningly successful progressive movements in our country's history.\n\nAnd yet, take this 2017 piece titled \"White Gay Men Are Hindering Our Progress as a Queer Community\" by Gabriel Arana, with its subhead \"You had your time-now, we have other things to fight for.\" To which I ask, if that's true, and the LGBTQ+ movement should no longer fight for white gay men, why would white gay men fight for the LGBTQ+ movement?\n\nIf your interest lies in sniping at people on Twitter, then sure, go ahead and chop up the pool of potential supporters for progressive change into smaller and smaller pieces, and tell most people within it that their problems aren't problems. If you want to actually change things, then you need to make sure everyone within your movement is taken seriously and treated well.\n\nThe problem with identity politics is that any given identity is always going to be smaller than the broader possible coalition you could assemble, and almost always smaller than you need to create change.\n\nConsider police violence. Annually, a majority of people killed by the police are white . During the days of greatest public anger about George Floyd's murder in May 2020, pointing out this fact came to be seen as wicked and racist; we weren't worrying about white people in that moment, the story went. But white people have a large numerical majority in the United States, an even larger numerical majority among voters, and (as the anti-racist set will tell you) enjoy disproportionate power in our political system.\n\nSo, what's the more effective message?\n\nPolice violence is a black people problem that only black people suffer from, a message that will convince a lot of white people that it's not their problem?\n\nOr:\n\nPolice violence falls especially hard on the black community, but it hurts all of us, and, in fact, a majority of the victims are white?\n\nWe need a national reckoning with this problem to stop the violence and save innocent people of all races. It's in the best interest of all of us.\n\nThe second message avoids defining the problem as a \"black problem.\" We can still recognize, as a community of the like-minded, that police violence against black Americans is vastly disproportionate and an expression of racism. But when we engage in politics, in the work of trying to build the biggest coalition possible for making change, we should not pretend that police violence is only a black problem. We also shouldn't compromise on the actual policies that we demand. But we must work to build the biggest possible coalition, which always entails appealing to people's sense of self-interest, not to their abstract sense of justice for others.\n\nI say that as a big fan of caring about the justice of others.\n\nIs that \"fair\"? Who cares? If you want change, you have to enlist the help of the powerful. That's life. Do you want to lose pure, or win by compromising? Not even compromising on goals, just on messaging! The question answers itself.\n\nClass Matters\n\nLabor unions have long been one of the best counterweights to corporate influence in politics. They are also traditionally a means of organizing that cuts across racial and ethnic lines. Obviously, shared participation in a union does not eradicate bigotry, and there is an ignominious history of unions perpetuating racial inequality. But it's also true that, at their best, labor unions have helped workers (mostly men) of different racial backgrounds see their shared interest as workers. This solidarity could never fully erase racial division, but it could convince people that their similar needs could unite them around common purpose.\n\nToo often, the left today seems determined to take the opposite approach. Many people on the left seem so dedicated to dividing up the world into smaller and smaller constituencies. You might consider the narrowing of \"people of color\" to \"BIPOC,\" black and indigenous people of color. The purpose of that distinction is to underline the greater oppression that black and indigenous Americans have endured than other people of color. And they probably have. The operative question, though, is: What is the political value of dividing up progressive constituencies into smaller and smaller groups? How does that help anyone achieve any of their specific aims, including BIPOC people?\n\nOrganizing along class lines does not mean we should stop messaging about race, gender, or sexual identity. When the problem is racism, call it racism. Never shy away from confronting racial or gender inequality in explicit and frank terms. But orienting around class lines means we create the majorities necessary to actually do something about racism, about sexism, et cetera.\n\nYounger generations of Democratic activists and staffers tend to insist that we ostentatiously put identity issues first. That, after all, was the story of the 2016 Democratic primary, where the old-school class politics of Bernie Sanders were pitted against the purposefully complex intersectionality of Hillary Clinton. Joe Biden's messaging around economic issues suggests the muscle memory for addressing pocketbook issues exists within the Democratic Party. What approach wins the day will help determine the future success of the left.\n\nTalk Like Human Beings Again\n\nI'm not a professor, but I'll always be an academic. I grew up in an academic household, I have a PhD, and I read academic publications regularly. I'll always be an academic at heart.\n\nBut it's not anti-intellectual to say that the left desperately needs to lose its academic vocabulary, which is overwhelmingly influenced by trends in humanities departments at elite universities.\n\nThat's because it is incomprehensible to ordinary Americans.\n\nStudents go through those programs and absorb a certain vocabulary, they graduate and go to work at nonprofits and in media and in Hollywood, and from there they spread the terminology. Social media, especially Tumblr and Twitter, helps ensure that this fancy vocabulary colonizes left-leaning spaces. Nobody wants to sound unsophisticated, so everyone adopts these terms even if they're not particularly comfortable with them. Like seemingly everything in the internet age, it's mimetic. And that's how you get people talking about the role of Latinx intersectionality in queering BIPOC spaces in the Global South.\n\nThis isn't merely a matter of using esoteric terms either, but of using ordinary language in ways many people find bizarre. Look at the use of the word bodies , most often heard in relation to black bodies. At some point in the past half decade or so, it became the fashion in left discursive spaces to speak about black bodies instead of black people -\"this protest was marked by the presence of black bodies, the white gaze fetishizes black bodies, academia is inhospitable to black bodies.\"\n\nIf I squint hard enough, I can sort of understand the rationale here; emphasizing bodies emphasizes corporeality, the physical reality of having a body, and in doing so underlines the threat black people are often under. I could, I suppose, see the utility of saying, \"The police's actions put black bodies in danger.\" But too often, black bodies is just an awkward and exclusionary euphemism for people , and a term used to show that someone is a savvy, progressive person with the correct attitudes toward race.\n\nWe should always keep an eye toward explaining our values and our policies in simple terms about who they help and how. This doesn't have to be complicated. In 1948, the British government distributed a pamphlet about its recently implemented national healthcare system. It began:\n\nYOUR NEW NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE BEGINS ON 5TH JULY. WHAT IS IT? HOW DO YOU GET IT?\n\nIt will provide you with all medical, dental and nursing care. Everyone-rich or poor, man, woman or child-can use it or any part of it. There are no charges, except for a few special items. There are no insurance qualifications. But it is not a \"charity.\" You are all paying for it, mainly as tax payers, and it will relieve your money worries in time of illness.\n\nThis is a model of clear language that explains the value of an essential public service, and a demonstration of how the left should talk about its policies.\n\nAll conversations should be as complicated as necessary; as simple as possible.\n\nI Promise It's Okay to Call Nonsense Nonsense\n\nWe live in culture war hell. The internet ensures that many of us spend all day, every day surrounded by the opinions of people we can't stand. In the scrum of the day-to-day turf war for the American soul, even minor skirmishes can seem to take on world-historical purpose. And in a relentlessly binary political culture, people frequently feel that to give any ground to \"the other side\" at all is to admit defeat. Which means that progressive culture warriors will often go to the wall for positions they see as broadly on their side, even if they're so extreme as to be ridiculous. They'll throw their full weight behind ideas and statements and arguments that they secretly feel to be stupid, so as not to tacitly lend support to the right.\n\nI promise: you don't have to do that.\n\nFor example, there are people who earnestly believe that the phrase I see what you mean is ableist-that is, disrespectful and oppressive toward people with disabilities-because some people can't see. This is-and I choose the word carefully-nuts.\n\nIt's nuts in several different dimensions all at once. This prohibition insults blind people, pretends to misunderstand the way language works, and is fundamentally unserious. It insults blind people and those with reduced vision because it assumes that they are incredibly sensitive and fragile, that if they come into contact with a perfectly common turn of phrase they've encountered all of their lives, they will be broken by it. As is true of so many contemporary progressive norms, this prohibition belittles and condescends to the very people it ostensibly honors. I have a disability myself, a mental illness. I am not hurt or offended by people using the word crazy , because I'm not so fragile as that and because I know how language works.\n\nAs I write this, a minor controversy has erupted of just the kind that I'm talking about here: the University of Southern California's School of Social Work has recently banned the use of the word field to refer to an academic discipline, as in the field of history . This is ostensibly because the word field might make black students and staff think of slavery. What black person could ever avoid hearing talk about fields, real or metaphorical?\n\nWhen nonsense goes unchallenged because it's perceived to be \"on our side,\" it metastasizes and spreads until suddenly, the majority of left-leaning people feel compelled to defend it. And ordinary people (that is, people not marinating in Twitter every day) will rightfully recognize the absurdity when they see it.\n\nI'm not interested in spending a lot of time chewing through social justice language or norms. But I do want to say this: It's okay to call nonsense nonsense, even if you feel it's on your side. I promise. You can defend your values, be a soldier for social justice, and be merciless toward conservatives while still admitting when feckless people take liberal ideology to bizarre ends.\n\nNo One Is Coming to Save Us\n\nThe foment of 2020 was transformative to many people. There was the palpable feeling that this time is different. You'd go out to the BLM protests, feel the energy, hear the slogans, see the righteous rage, and feel like something had to give. For a brief moment, it felt like the glass was breaking.\n\nAnd then time went on, and nothing much changed, and it turned out that it's hard to get out of the well-worn grooves of contemporary politics.\n\nThis can seem dispiriting to young leftists. But to them, I say, you need to stop expecting politics to fundamentally and dramatically change. Stop waiting for the revolution.\n\nThings change, and sometimes they change quickly. Gay marriage is a fundamentally different issue than, say, single-payer healthcare-in particular, because gay marriage did not threaten an immense private industry the way single-payer does-but it's still worth considering just what a remarkable transformation was seen in this country regarding that issue.\n\nIn 2004, Republican strategist Karl Rove used gay marriage as a wedge issue , utilizing it to bludgeon John Kerry in his failed campaign to replace George W. Bush in the White House. Not twenty years later, even most Republicans don't attempt to run against gay marriage in elections, because that right is now so deeply established. (And, as of 2022, it is enshrined in federal law , rather than merely required by Supreme Court precedent.) Something like that could happen with healthcare too.\n\nBut if single-payer were passed tomorrow, we would have to start defending it tomorrow. We'd have to fight over how generous the benefits were. We would have to ensure that dental and vision benefits were covered. We would have to prevent the inevitable attempts by conservatives to tear down the system entirely or to make it considerably less generous, as they already do with Medicare and Social Security. There would be no rest.\n\nThis is, I concede, a depressing condition, an exhausting one. But there's no alternative. And perhaps there shouldn't be. I still yearn for revolution, but I now recognize that any revolution must be a permanent one, in the sense meant by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels-that a perpetual revolutionary class must exist, remaining independent from the political machinery of its day and constantly pressing for a more radical future, even after great victory. This is the only way to truly secure the best good for the most people. We must see political success as an ever-receding horizon.\n\nThe steady and unromantic work of making the world a little better, one day at a time, has its own rewards. Wherever you are, there are likely organizations whose work is consonant with your values. Research them. Go to a meeting. See if they're the kind of people you would be happy to work with. Then picket, or protest, or persuade, or stuff envelopes, or hand out leaflets, or bug your state legislator, or hold a sign by the side of the highway, or organize a tenants' association, or raise money, or boycott, or what you will. You will not be able to see the change you make. But you will feel it anyway.\n\nFreddie deBoer writes a daily newsletter on Substack . This essay is an edited excerpt from his new book, How Elites Ate the Social Justice Movement .\n\nBecome a Free Press subscriber today:\n\nAlthough I am certainly not a leftist or part of the progressive movement, I read this article in its entirety, finding it to be an interesting and thoughtful read until I got to the phrase \"you can still be merciless towards conservatives.\" Up until that statement, although we have different and even some opposing ideas about policies, I respected the author and what he had to say. I was open to listening to what he had to say. Why must you be merciless or encourage others to be merciless to conservatives? We are all human beings with dignity and value. For all your talk about compromise and working together, that statement tells me you engage in the same identity politics that you claim to be a detriment to getting things done and making a real impact.\n\nThis guy is a complete fool.  He should be forced to give two examples of where Marxism has been implemented AND led to human flourishing.  He can't and he wont.  Anyone who believes in Marxism as a means for organizing a society is an an absolute fool or absolute idiot.  Or both.  Just because he may be a good writer doesn't change that one iota.\n\nNo posts"

      "text": "The data about police shootings just didn't add up, but no one at Thomson Reuters wanted to hear it.\n\n\"Here I was trying to bring the company's attention to how we were spreading lies that were contributing to the murders of thousands of black people, \"\n\n-Yeah.....don't think that was your primary concern/motivation.\n\nA horde isn't capable of intellectual courage, just blunt trauma. Onward, sir! Good luck in getting the courts to uncover the truth.\n\nA horde isn't capable of intellectual courage, just blunt trauma. Onward, sir! Good luck in getting the courts to uncover the truth.\n\nYou have fought the good fight. I do pray you find meaningful work. Thank you for being a person of conscience\n\nI saved this article in my inbox because I feel it is such an important topic.  I have a hard time looking at any of the \"news\" sources and believing anything they say.  And that is bad, because I am not alone.  I want news without an agenda.  I want both sides of a story told.  I want to know that while a reporter cannot always overcome their biases they should at least work to minimize them, and be honest about them.\n\nIn the summer of 2020 I looked up statistics, from a left leaning organization, and was surprised to find that there around 1,100 people killed annually by the police.  Of that 1,100 around 70% were armed and a threat to the police.  So we are going to burn down cities and gut police forces in a country of over 300 million due to around 350 unarmed people being killed by police.  That is absurd.\n\nWe must be able to openly and honestly discuss the issues without fear of losing our jobs or being cancelled.  Do we need to find a way to police better?  Yes!  Do we need to find a way to increase the trust minority communities have with the police?  Yes!  But we will NEVER be able to do that if we can't have honest conversations about where we are as a country.  And we MUST be able to trust the news to be impartial, and sadly, we cannot.  All to the peril of the people BLM claims to be trying to help.\n\nThis should be required reading for all US citizens.  Wonderful job articulating an experience shared by so many.  This insanity has to stop.\n\nThis is a great example of how poorly educated Americans are when it comes to making basic judgements about the likelihood of things being true or false.  We get caught up in specific details that excite certain aspects of our imagination and fail to see when the broader picture doesn't even warrant digging for more information.  This is what statistically minded individuals call \"Bayesian reasoning\" and is the antidote for conspiratorial theorizing.\n\nFalse ideas about a stolen 2020 Election are a perfect example of this.  For the most part, the election results were well in line with predictions - the only real surprises were in Trump's favor, not Joe Biden's.  All of the pivotal states which Biden won were states he was either expected to win or at worst were toss-ups.  The events of Election night, including the \"red mirage\", \"blue wave\", and the fact that we probably weren't going to know the winner on election night (and if we did that winner almost certainly would have been Biden), were all predicted in advance by knowledgeable experts, and people who were watching responsible media outlets were well prepared for the possibilities.  The idea that a political party would have risked engineering a fraudulent election which they were about 90% likely to win in the first place doesn't withstand even basic scrutiny.  So any details one delves into at that point would need to be overwhelmingly significant to merit attention.\n\nIn the case of the BLM movement, the simple and easily verified fact that Black men commit violent crimes at several times the rate of white men should have been enough to set a high bar for evidence of a bias in shootings.  But it didn't.  Why?\n\nBecause in both of these cases we are dealing with deeply ingrained biases on differing sides of our culture war.  On the right, people have spent decades being inculcated into an ever-shrinking world of paranoid anti-institutionalism propagated by entertainment-driven right-wing media personalities and outlets.\n\nOn the left, roughly that same amount of time has been spent under the crushing influence of white guilt, training our minds to instinctively look away from any demographic statistics which might paint a minority group in an unflattering light.  As such, I strongly suspect that many progressives are actually unaware of statistics on black crime, assuming that they are either racist stereotypes or the result of bias in arrests and convictions.  When in fact - Bayesian reasoning applies here as well - they are pretty much what one would expect given the relative rates of poverty in which blacks are raised.\n\nThank you for this article.  I am heartbroken by the destruction that Black people face in their communities and I am angered by the duplicity of BLM, the movement, and the media.  It's time to birth a new movement: ALL Black Lives Matter. I would hope this new movement is based on accurate data and espouses policies that protect all black lives, especially the innocent lives trapped in urban areas.  I also hope this is accomplished without promoting divisiveness and hatred, as does BLM. BLM is especially intolerant towards anyone that disagrees with their policies and towards Jewish people who love Black people and who love Israel.\n\nI'd like to see what he posted. With a salary like that this thinking man seemed to be strangely isolated from the top men and women in his company.  Being fired by HR seems odd to me as well. But then I don't make $350,000 a year.\n\nThis is a fascinating and very timely article. There's a lot in that seems right to me. That said, there's also one part where I'm not sure I follow the reasoning. I'm not a statistician, so it's possible I'm missing something that will seem obvious to others.\n\nThe author writes:\n\n\"According to calculations (published by Patrick Frey, Deputy District Attorney for Los Angeles County) based on FBI data, black Americans account for 37 percent of those who murder police officers, and 34 percent of the unarmed suspects killed by police. Meanwhile, whites make up 42.7 percent of cop killers and 42 percent of the unarmed suspects shot by police-meaning whites are killed by police at a 7 percent higher rate than blacks.\"\n\nMy question is, What does the percentage of police murdered by black Americans tell us about the percentage of _unarmed_ black Americans killed by police? In cases where the person shot is unarmed, why wouldn't the demographic base rate be more relevant?\n\nThere may be a good answer to this question. At any rate, I think it would be helpful to spell that part out more fully. (The next paragraph, with the 70% figure, would also be easier to process if the figures were provided.)\n\nI hope this doesn't sound like a nitpick. I think this set of issues needs to be explored and set out as clearly as possible.\n\nA sad commentary on our.public media. The Reuters leadership is sanctioning the destruction of a man's career, because he attempted to communicate the truth internally within his.organization, not.publicly. I assume the attempted destruction of his career is the result.of poorly educated twenty some things and thirtysomethings who currently infest all types.of organizatioms. I am.happy that I.am seventysomething retiree. I sympathize with all.those compelled.tomendure.today 's toxicnwork.environment.\n\nZac, facts caused me to leave the Democrat Party, become an independent, and eventually a Republican.  Having been raised in a Democrat household I was so brainwashed against Republicans that it was really a struggle.  But when I finally let down my defenses and allowed myself to be around other women who were Republican, I realized I was home.  It takes truly being honest and spending a great deal of time doing a thorough fact checking to understand that the Republicans were the original non-racists and they utterly believe in freedom of speech and thought.\n\nNo political party is perfect, including the Republican Party, but the first thing one needs to do when they realize they are in a deep hole is to stop digging.  So yes, be brave in your research, be courageous enough to see and tell the truth.  Although losing a $350,000 a year job is a hell of a jolt, the truth will set you free - and freedom is what it is all about in this country.  Now... start your own business and you won't have to answer to a bunch of leftist wackos.  It is probably as if you've been in the Matrix and you've broken loose from your previous reality.  Don't be surprised that your mind keeps having to adjust as you move forward through this experience.\n\nZac, Thank you for sharing your story and for your excellent work regarding BLM's claims regarding police violence against Blacks.  It took great courage.  Like you, I believe the greatest tragedy is the 10,000 Black people who are murdered each year in the US.  I hope that your work will help us focus more on that issue which would save lives.\n\nThe most important article I have read this year  and the saddest. goo luck. being honest in a sea of liars must be terrible. county yourself lucky to have risen from the muck. as was once said. let all the poisons that .lurk in the mud hatch out\n\nZac, why don't you go into some detail about what individuals did and specifically name names?People should be held accountable for heinous acts, to admonish you because you had another viewpoint, one supported by facts, that's crazy.\n\nThese irrational cancel culture types should be identified, so they are held accountable and their shaming should show the light to others, to stay away from obvious reprehensible actions, if for no other reason that you will be outed.\n\nI don't believe this is cancel culture, it's more that people would called out for hurting someone else through acting shamefully. If their actions are not deemed to be wrong, they have nothing to worry about.\n\nSo depressing. I'm a former journalist, and to see that an outfit like Thomsen Reuters is determined to ignore the truth -- from a guy making $350K to crunch data! -- to maintain the BLM narrative is maddening. I genuinely fear the Republic. One can only hope more and more people find sites like Common Sense for balanced, objective reporting."

      "text": "Last year, Brian Lande, an officer in the Richmond, California police department, had to draw his gun to stop two drunk men from clobbering each other to death with metal rods.\n\nIn 2015, he threatened deadly force to stop a fight between two more drunk men. One was armed with a hatchet. Another, with a wrench.\n\nOn another occasion, he drew his firearm to arrest a man hopping a backyard fence, fleeing the scene of a burglary.\n\nNone of these was remarkable in Richmond, a working-class city just east of San Francisco that's notorious for its drive-by shootings, break-ins, carjackings, and countless petty crimes.\n\nWhen I asked Lande if he often had to unholster his gun-a standard-issue Glock 17-he told me he'd done it so many times that \"they all bleed into each other.\"\n\nLuckily, he's never had to pull the trigger.\n\nBut things could easily have gone south. If a suspect had made a suspicious move or pulled something out of his pocket that looked like a gun-it happens more than you'd think-he would have had less than a quarter of a second to make the most awful decision of his life: whether to kill another human being.\n\n\"You're in an incredibly inauspicious situation,\" Lande told me. \"The chance of making a good faith mistake is high.\"\n\nWhat that means is that if you're a cop, you've got to be confident that if a tragedy occurs-if a life is taken that should not have been taken-your chief, your city council, the powers that be will at least treat you fairly, hear you out, and ensure that justice is served.\n\nBut these days, a growing number of cops aren't so sure of that. Making the wrong decision is now a lot more likely to land you in prison, Lande explained. \"It's not tenable for my family,\" he said. So in early 2022, he started thinking about quitting his dream job.\n\nHe was hardly alone.\n\nA 2021 survey showed that police departments nationwide saw resignations jump by 18 percent-and retirements by 45 percent-over the previous year, with hiring decreasing by five percent. The Los Angeles Police Department has been losing 50 officers a month to retirement, more than the city can replace with recruits. Oakland lost about seven per month in 2021, with the number of officers sinking below the city's legally mandated minimum.\n\nThe list goes on: Chicago has lost more cops than it has in two decades. New Orleans is backfilling its shortfall of officers with civilians. New York is losing more police officers than it has since such figures started being recorded. Minneapolis and Baltimore have similar stories. St. Louis-one of the most dangerous cities in America-has lost so many cops that there's a seven-foot-tall, 10-foot-wide pile of uniforms from outgoing officers at police headquarters called \" Mount Exodus .\"\n\nAnd in San Francisco, just across the bay from Richmond, the police department has seen 50 officers out of a force of fewer than 2,000 take off for smaller, suburban departments, according to Lieutenant Tracy McCray, the head of the city's police union.\n\n\"That was a lot of talent for us,\" McCray said. \"They were great, bright new cops. A couple of them were born and raised in the city.\" These were the kind of officers that advocates for reform say they want more of: cops from the communities they police, black cops, Latino cops. \"All of their roots they had here,\" she said. \"They just up and left.\"\n\nA big part of what's prompting police to leave America's big cities is the perception the public has turned against them. A 2020 poll showed that only seven percent of police officers would advise their kids to go into law enforcement. Eighty-three percent of those who wouldn't recommend it cited \"lack of respect for the profession.\"\n\n\"Suddenly, everyone is telling us how to do our jobs. They're saying we're biased, racist, only want to hurt black and brown communities,\" said McCray, who is black. \"These officers worked in these communities, were invested in these communities. Suddenly, people who don't know us are saying you're this, you're that.\"\n\nIf you appreciate our in-depth reporting on the most important stories in America, become a subscriber:\n\nThe shift in police officers' perception of how they're viewed by the public happened gradually-starting with the first Black Lives Matter protests of 2013, after the shooting death of Travyon Martin and the acquittal of the man who killed him, George Zimmerman. There were more BLM demonstrations: in 2014, following the deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York. Then came the 2015-2016 Democratic presidential primaries, in which BLM played a prominent role.\n\nAnd then, in late May 2020, George Floyd, a black man, was killed by a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, and it was caught on video. The incident ignited protests across the country -a \"racial reckoning\"-and soon after, reform.\n\nIn some cities, including Portland, Oregon and Columbus, Ohio, local governments set up police review boards with the power to subpoena police records and oversee day-to-day policing. States including Illinois , Minnesota , and Oregon tightened use-of-force standards. New Mexico and Minnesota required officers to intervene if another officer was using what might be deemed unreasonable physical force.\n\nIt became popular-even fashionable-for politicians in progressive circles to flaunt their anti-police credentials. In Minneapolis, where George Floyd was killed, the city council resolved to \"begin the process of ending the Minneapolis Police Department.\" (They reversed course after crime surged.) In New York, after winning the Democratic congressional primary, now-Rep. Jamaal Bowman tweeted : \"Police officers have sworn to protect and serve the institution of white supremacy.\"\n\nA month later, the ACLU tweeted that \"policing is rotten to its core\" and \"has always been a racist institution in the United States.\"\n\nIn Portland, Kristina Narayan-the legislative director for Tina Kotek, who was then Oregon's Speaker of the House and is now the governor-was arrested while participating in anti-police protests at which Molotov cocktails were thrown at the cops.\n\nAll of this revealed a disconnect between progressives and much of the rest of the country, including many Democrats: A 2020 New York Times poll showed that 63 percent of registered voters opposed cutting police budgets while 55 percent of Biden supporters favored it.\n\n\"When I was a cop, we were afraid we might mess up and get in trouble,\" said Peter Moskos, a former Baltimore police officer who teaches at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. \"But you had to do something wrong. Now cops are getting in trouble for doing exactly what they're supposed to do.\"\n\n\"The rules of the game changed,\" said Brian Lande, the Richmond police officer. He was referring to a 2019 California law that further limits when cops can use force-and more broadly, to the shift in thinking among Democratic elites.\n\nLande went on: \"Let's say you see a guy, he's just robbed a bank, he's got a gun, he's running now into the preschool.\" Once upon a time, that would have been enough to justify using force. Now you've got to be confident that a crime is \"imminent\"-and sometimes you have only milliseconds to figure that out.\n\nIf you get it wrong, and if the skin color of the cop and the victim suit the narrative that cops are propping up the institution of white supremacy and wantonly snuffing out black bodies, you could be prosecuted as a murderer.\n\n\"Other people who don't live in your community, but who are speaking on behalf of your community, don't know what the fuck they're talking about,\" McCray told me. \"Black Lives Matter was talking about putting ambassadors on the street-where they at?\" Referring to one of San Francisco's most violent neighborhoods, she added: \"Haven't seen one damn member of Black Lives Matter patrolling the Bayview making sure police aren't 'hunting and killing black people.' \"\n\nLande added: \"If you're a cop, you're like, 'Okay, well, I guess I'm not going to put myself in situations where that's likely to occur.' So I'm not going to go make traffic stops in places and of people that I think might likely be carrying firearms, because I don't want to have to get that decision right. That's too hard.\"\n\nIn Richmond, the politicians were signaling loud and clear: we don't like cops.\n\nAfter the riots in Ferguson, and especially after the murder of George Floyd, the Richmond City Council cut the police budget, forcing hiring freezes. Council members also threatened to slash officers' salaries by 20 percent.\n\nBy last spring, the Richmond Police Department had lost so many officers that those who remained were forced to work overtime 40 to 60 hours per month. That requirement came on top of being forced to work back-to-back shifts when unexpected vacancies opened up. Investigations and traffic enforcement more or less stopped. Burnt-out officers were just doing patrols-driving around passively, waiting for something to happen.\n\nWhen Lande tried to recruit new officers, cops told him they preferred to go somewhere with a friendlier local government, where they wouldn't have to fear getting laid off or having their salaries and benefits reduced. Many went to Napa and Sonoma Counties-wine country.\n\nLast September, Lande followed suit and left Richmond. \"I felt very conflicted about it,\" Lande told me. \"Residents of Richmond are disproportionately poorer, disproportionately victims of violent crimes.\"\n\nLande and I had known each other since our graduate school days, studying sociology at Berkeley. He's one of the most thoughtful and educated-and experienced-cops in the Bay Area. He has published academic papers on how to train the police to interact more effectively with the public. He had studied this question-police-community relations-while on a stint at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which is part of the Pentagon.\n\nBut research hadn't been enough for Lande. \"As an academic sociologist, I learned quickly that my ability to make a difference was pretty limited,\" he said. As a police officer, he went on, \"I could make a difference in people's lives-and I wasn't bad at it.\"\n\nHe loved his job in Richmond. But the calculus of policing had changed.\n\nIn August, as Lande was preparing to leave, Richmond saw four murders in the span of a week. In the same time period, Oakland, to the south, experienced five murders in three days-and the following month, three homicides in a single hour.\n\nLande transferred to Kensington, a 15-minute drive away.\n\nKensington is filled with California craftsman-style bungalows, mid-century ranch houses and Spanish-style villas with Priuses and Teslas out front, and decks with gorgeous views of the San Francisco Bay out back. Black Lives Matters signs are everywhere, reflecting Kensington residents' solidarity with working-class black people in cities like Richmond-even as Richmond has become less safe as a result of the changes that movement has ushered in.\n\nLife is good: Officer Lande is now Sergeant Lande. His job involves far fewer risks. Much of his day is filled with administrative work at the station. When he goes out on patrol, he mostly writes parking tickets.\n\nBut he is not optimistic. \"An enormous amount of damage has been done,\" he told me. \"Instead of seeing real investment in policing, like what we see in Europe, we've seen a massive disinvestment.\"\n\nIn August 2022, President Biden announced his Safer America Plan in response to rising crime . Among other things, it includes plans to hire 100,000 more police officers. That upset the ACLU, which disparaged the plan as \"more criminalization and incarceration,\" and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, which asserted -without providing evidence-that adding police officers would only victimize black people.\n\nPeter Moskos, the former Baltimore police officer now teaching at John Jay College, was mystified by progressives who insist that the single greatest threat faced by black Americans is systemic racism. \"Congratulations!\" said Moskos, who has called for legalizing drugs in response to the drug war's ineffectiveness and its disproportionate impact on young black men. \"You've increased the black murder rate. You're giving blacks worse policing through this transfer of cops-and doing it smugly in the name of racial justice.\"\n\nLeighton Woodhouse is a journalist and documentary filmmaker in Oakland. His last piece for The Free Press was about the mythical origins of Santa Claus.\n\nwherever progressives pollute an area with their idiotic and unproven 'progress', woe is sure to follow. that is 100% accurate in the united states.\n\nThere are DOJ investigations into departments like Chicago and Baltimore that found routine civil rights violations.  These departments had major issues for years and years but the police omerta blocked any efforts to self correct.  Things came to a head and now the scales have tipped the other way and the police are on their back foot with people questioning every single move they make, no matter how reasonable.\n\nWhat's the lesson?  The lesson is that credible oversight over state power is needed.  That's not some wackadoo liberal agenda, it's a fundamental requirement for just government.  If you don't have that oversight abuses *will* happen and there *will* be a backlash that goes too far.\n\nYou're also seeing innovation in cities like Newark moving back towards community policing.  We're seeing that cracking down hard on crime isn't always the right thing to do - not because it hurts people's feelings but because it doesn't actually work.  That urban departments are losing officers that are amenable to reform is probably the most concerning thing in this story because that is the reasonable solution to the actual issue we're having, rather than some political football everyone likes to toss around.\n\nThere is also the issue that the power of the police is given to them by the citizens they police.  If the community isn't OK with killing someone for selling loosies, then the police can't kill someone for selling loosies.  There is no \"right\" for the police to just do whatever they want.\n\n10 or 15 years ago it was easy to find conservatives concerned about no knock warrants and other questionable police tactics.  Now that the left has taken on this cause (ironic since it is liberal cities which have the biggest problems with police abuse) all the conservatives have decided that the police are paragons of virtue, beyond reproach, and that anything they do is in the best interest of society.  It is no more or less idiotic than the left questioning obviously legitimate uses of force.\n\nLike every issue the truth is in the middle.  Most officers are great people.  Some of them are not.  Where you have people abusing their power that needs to be corrected.  When you have police legitimately using force in the face of wild and dangerous criminals crucifying them is not productive.  Policing strategies which are not having the desired effect need to be reexamined.\n\nIt's all common sense, but America doesn't care about common sense anymore.  They care about being right and creating well defined enemies.\n\nNo posts"

      "text": "As the Israel-Hamas war drags on in its second month and shows no sign of abating, many Westerners have drawn comparisons between the state of Israel and Jim Crow-era America or apartheid South Africa. In their telling, Israelis are the white people, Palestinians are the black people, and the ethics of the conflict mirror the ethics of Jim Crow and apartheid.\n\nOnce framed this way, the correct view becomes obvious. Israelis: racist oppressors. Palestinians: noble victims.\n\nThis view of the Arab-Israeli conflict has lodged itself deeply in the Western psyche. It is why organizations like Amnesty International condemn Israel as an \" apartheid state \" despite the glaring differences between Israel and the canonical example of apartheid South Africa. It is why Black Lives Matter chapters across America came out in reflexive support of Hamas mere days after the terror group slaughtered 1,200 Israelis in the most gruesome ways imaginable. And it is why Ta-Nehisi Coates, considered by many to be America's leading public intellectual on race, recently called Israel a \"Jim Crow regime\" and compared cities in the West Bank to Baltimore and Chicago.\n\nBut close-to-home analogies rarely explain distant events. These analogies, while convenient and easy to understand, do more to mislead than to inform. Nowhere has this been truer than in comparisons between the Israeli-Arab conflict and the West's racial and colonial history.\n\nLet's start with the idea, which The Washington Post 's Karen Attiah has recently amplified , that Zionism is similar to European colonialism.\n\nWhereas Europeans had no claim to belong in the New World, Jews are indigenous to the land and have lived there continuously for millennia. Just before the first wave of Zionist migration in the late nineteenth century, there was a pre-existing Jewish community there numbering between 13,000 and 20,000. European colonialists sought to expand empires and extract wealth on behalf of their home countries. Early Zionists, by contrast, were poor migrants fleeing pogroms, legally migrating to their ancestral homeland, and purchasing small tracts of land from willing Arab sellers. Once the British Mandate began, more Jews (many fleeing the Nazis) migrated and purchased land, such that by 1947, hundreds of thousands of Jews had migrated into the region. And in the years after 1948, the overwhelming majority of Jews living in Arab countries-fleeing persecution in places like Iraq, Morocco, and Egypt-migrated to Israel.\n\nBlack Americans had our own version of Zionism. In the first half of the nineteenth century, roughly 5,000 black Americans-some fleeing slavery and others fleeing Northern racism-sailed to West Africa and in 1847 founded the nation of Liberia: a black ethnostate meant to be a haven for African Americans. Another ten thousand or so black Americans would migrate to Liberia in the decades after its founding. In the 1920s, Marcus Garvey's \"Back to Africa\" movement-which planned to move blacks by the tens of thousands into Liberia-was at the height of its popularity with African Americans, with membership numbering in the millions.\n\nThough in hindsight we might criticize the practicality of either project, we shouldn't deny the appeal of returning to one's ancestral homeland, especially in the context of fleeing persecution.\n\nNor should we regard such projects as similar to the projects of Christopher Columbus or Hernán Cortés. It would be easy to stop Columbus mid-voyage and tell him to turn back to Europe. But you'd have to be heartless to tell an ex-slave sailing to West Africa in 1840 to turn around and go back to Mississippi, or to tell a Jewish refugee sailing to the British Mandate in the 1940s to turn around and go back to Europe (though the British did, in fact, do just that ).\n\nA key difference between the nature of the Israeli-Arab conflict and South African apartheid is that Israeli policies in the occupied West Bank-checkpoints, movement restrictions, and so forth-are rooted in legitimate security concerns rather than racism. Because the word security has been dulled through overuse, it is crucial to remember what it really means. Security means preventing what happened on October 7-which Hamas has promised to do over and over if given the chance. No function of the state could be more important.\n\nSome critics of Israel will be quick to point out that defenders of South African apartheid also used \"security\" as a justification for the apartheid system. The difference is that in the case of South Africa, it was a false pretext. In apartheid South Africa, marriage (and even sex) between blacks and whites was punishable by prison time. South African officials would decide your race (and therefore your fate) by running a comb through your hair. If it ran all the way through without too much resistance, you were considered legally white.\n\nThese policies, which lie at the core of apartheid South Africa, were the result not of security concerns but of an ideological obsession with racial classification and a horror at the thought of \"race-mixing.\" Such policies would be unthinkable in Israel, where Arab Israelis are full citizens, enjoying the right to vote, serve in the Israeli parliament and the Knesset, and even sit on the Supreme Court.\n\nAs with every society on Earth, there is racism in Israel. But the truth is that if you're looking for the closest analogue to the racist propaganda experienced by blacks in European-offshoot societies, you will find it not on the Israeli side but on the Palestinian side. Consider the ghoulish, antisemitic TV programs that indoctrinate Palestinian children. There is no Israeli equivalent.\n\nThere is yet another inconvenient fact for those who want to reduce the Israeli-Arab conflict to a competition between European settlers and people of color: the majority of Israeli Jews are not European. They are Mizrahi Jews-hailing from the Middle East and North Africa. What's more, it is not the European Jews but the Mizrahi Jews-who are difficult to visually distinguish from Palestinians-that form most of the voting base of the right-wing parties that Israel's critics consider to be the truly racist ones.\n\nWhen ideologues co-opt the African American freedom struggle and compare it to the Palestinian national movement, they do black Americans a grave disservice. Black Americans (aside from a fringe) did not seek to dominate and destroy white society, as Martin Luther King Jr. emphasized frequently in his speeches. African Americans pursued equality before the law and better economic circumstances. In black history, you can find the occasional Nat Turner, the slave who led a rebellion and advocated killing all whites. But compared to the leaders of the struggle-giants like Frederick Douglass and Martin Luther King-radicals like Turner amount to a footnote in the black American struggle for equality.\n\nEven early Malcolm X, the most prominent mouthpiece for black radicalism, was not interested in a violent takeover whereby blacks would run all of America and render whites second-class citizens. When he expressed black nationalism as more than a metaphor, he made clear that he was interested in a partitioning of black and white states inside America or a black ethnostate somewhere outside of America entirely.\n\nPalestinian leaders, by contrast, seek dominion over all the land existing between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. Some, like Hamas, have even more radical ambitions: a global Islamic caliphate. Palestinian leaders have rejected every partition offer they have ever received: the Peel Commission in 1937, the UN partition of 1947, the offers made at Camp David as well as the Clinton Parameters in 2000, and Olmert's proposal in 2008. In the Palestinian national movement, the common denominator has been the rejection of a Jewish state of any size and scope, as well as the unyielding demand for nothing less than a Palestinian Arab state to subsume Israel: \"from the river to the sea,\" as the chant goes.\n\nAs for tactics, there is nothing in the history of mainstream African American political activism analogous to Hamas's use of its own people as human shields ; their use of a civilian hospital as a torture chamber ; their denial of resources to their own people despite billions of dollars in international aid; their system of cash rewards to incentivize suicide bombings against civilian targets; their indiscriminate rocket fire on civilians; their practice of taking children and the elderly as hostages; and the combination of millenarianism and genocidal bloodlust evoked in their founding charter .\n\nIf you'd like to defend Hamas, then go ahead. But do not take the easy way out by making farcical comparisons between the black freedom struggle and Palestinian nationalism or between European colonialism and Zionism.\n\nColeman Hughes is a columnist for The Free Press. Read his piece \" Why Is TED Scared of Color Blindness? \" and follow him on X @coldxman .\n\nBecome a Free Press subscriber today:\n\nToo bad, yourwisdom and reasoning will not be read by those who are pro-Palestinian as it does not fit their agenda. Their only reasoning is the more melanin you have, the more virtuous you are.\n\nSo Coates thinks Gaza and the West Bank are like Chicago? I'm from Chicago, and there are some really blighted neighborhoods on the south and west sides where 3-5 people are shot and killed every weekend, where squad cars crawl everywhere, where the only stores pretty much suck, where train stops are non-existent, where the roads are so full of potholes they're undriveable, and where menacing dudes hang out in the parks after dark. And funny - nobody from these neighborhoods has ever mobilized a coordinated attack of the \"nice\" neighborhoods in order to wantonly murder people at a dance club, to take babies and grandparents as hostages, to rape women to death and mutilate them afterwards, to torture children in front of their parents, or to hack people's heads off with garden tools.  Maybe Coates can explain.\n\nNo posts"

      "text": "BLM: The Making of a New Marxist Revolution, by Mike Gonzalez (Encounter Books, 2021), 234 pages.\n\nA running joke on the climate-skeptic right depicts environmentalists as political watermelons-green on the outside, red on the inside. After the rampant rioting and looting of two summers ago that used George Floyd's death as a pretext, it's high time the culprits got their own fruit analogy. Per Mike Gonzalez's latest book, BLM: The Making of a New Marxist Revolution (2021), the namesake group resembles a fig-black on the outside, red on the inside. For all its outward pretension of caring for the plight of black Americans, the movement's inner drive has proven to be the overhaul of American society along Marxist lines.\n\nMuch like his prior bestseller The Plot to Change America (2020), Gonzalez's book argues the simple point that today's far-left social movements didn't come out of nowhere-they've only been portrayed as such by a pliant media. For the lay observer, Black Lives Matter (BLM) may seem like a discrete response to the killings of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, and George Floyd, one limited to advocating for the rooting out of racial inequities from policing and the criminal justice system. Gonzalez proves beyond doubt that this is not the case. BLM is but the latest iteration of a long effort, first undertaken by the Soviet Union, to whip up racial animus and urban unrest for the benefit of Marxist causes. \"Behind the prison and police reform façade,\" he writes, \"lies a deep ideological commitment to abandoning our free-market and liberal democratic system and to remaking America along Marxist lines.\" The reason this effort has fared far better than in the 1920s and 1960s is owed to the media's refusal to cover these groups critically and to the state of ritualistic self-flagellation into which the liberal establishment has been cowed since the killing of George Floyd.\n\nGonzalez has emerged as one of the country's leading analysts of the far left, but his real beat is intellectual history. The Plot to Change America (2020) traced identity politics back to a century-old tradition of Marxist thought, beginning with the Gramscian pivot from economics to culture as the locus of oppression, and continued by the Frankfurt School's export of critical theory to American college campuses. This latest book begins further back, with the founding of our republic. BLM's view of America as an irredeemably racist country eternally beset by racial inequities grounded in its founding documents, Gonzalez argues, echoes the views of John Calhoun and the pro-slavery factions leading up to the Civil War, who similarly saw the Jeffersonian dictum that \"all men are created equal\" as dangerous, preferring in its stead a nation made up of factions representing relativistic values. \"Part of the reason that the woke complex today dismisses the Constitution,\" he writes, \"is that, as it has been written and amended, it stands in the way of many of the things they want to do, from instituting group rights and racial privileges to suppressing the right to speech, property and conscience.\"\n\nBut BLM can't be reduced to its interpretation of the Founding, lest we overlook the forward-looking elements of its ideology. Gonzalez proceeds to sketch a history of the links between communism and parts of the African American community beginning in the mid-19th century, when the Marxist objection to American capitalism wasn't so much slavery as wage slavery -namely, industrial employment. As soon as it formed, the Soviet Union began its own efforts to convert black Americans to communism through figures from the so-called Harlem Renaissance of black letters, such as Lanston Hughes, W.E.B. Du Bois and Claude McKay. The Soviets' ambition to destabilize America by setting up \"a separate Negro state\" from which to launch a revolution across the rest of the country, however, did not align with Marcus Garvey, the leader of the separatist, pan-Africanist wing of the black movement working towards a similar end. In fact, Garvey would remain a staunch anti-communist all his life. \"Though black intellectuals may have fallen for the siren song of communism,\" Gonzalez writes, \"rank and file black Americans saw through Moscow's actions and said no, thanks.\"\n\nBut the mix of Marxism and racial identitarianism would come to a head in the 1960s, when \"the core principle of the civil rights era-that discrimination on the basis of race was evil-was almost instantly reversed.\" A new generation of black leaders including Malcolm X, Stokey Carmichael, Angela Davis, and Assata Shakur would break with the civil rights movement's incrementalist methods and color-blind policies, instead deeming white Americans-and thus America at large-inherently evil. This, in Gonzalez's telling, is precisely the generation that trained, groomed, and eventually passed the torch to today's BLM leaders, people such as Opal Tometi, Patrice Cullors, Alicia Garza, and Melina Abdullah. \"Even before they created the hashtag expression #BlackLivesMatter in 2013 that later became an empire of revolutionary organizations around the world,\" Gonzalez writes, \"they belonged or associated with an interlacing web of socialist groups that have been trying to overthrow the American system for decades.\"\n\nSince emerging as an online rallying cry in the wake of Trayvon Martin's death, BLM has been beefed up with considerable organizing muscle through the creation of the Movement for Black Lives (M4BL) and BLM Global Network Foundation, \"both radical, anti-capitalist organizations that seek a root-and-branch change of the way the U.S. is constituted.\" In 2020, this network was further ramped up through the creation of a SuperPAC-meaning that BLM can fund candidates and lobby for bills-all thanks to the support of an interlocking web of philanthropic organizations-George Soros's Open Society Foundations, Susan Rosenberg's Thousand Currents, Drummond Pike's Tides Foundation, and the Buffett family's NoVo Foundation. Through its lobbying of Congress and its funding of soft-on-crime district attorney races, BLM has been able to pressure the FBI out of investigating violence committed by what it calls Black Identity Extremists (BIEs), and effectively lessen the punishment for the lawlessness that dovetails with BLM.\n\nFor depicting such a despairing phenomenon, the book ends on a remarkably hopeful note. Gonzalez hopes that the moral panic about the state of America's race relations that so bedevils our elites can be stemmed and eventually rolled back through a combination of reasoned reforms making police departments more accountable, cold-headed books like his proving that the impression of a \"carceral state\" up against black Americans is an illusion, and the kind of civil courage on display in the grassroots effort to stop critical race theory continuing. Thirty years ago, America led the world's defeat of communism.

      "text": "For about a month now, America's major cities have treated to nightly orgies of old-fashioned, rope-and-torch iconoclasm. Statues of variously \"problematic\" historical figures (including both Robert E. Lee and, for some reason, Ulysses S. Grant) are defaced, torn from their rivets, and set on fire.\n\nAs cooler minds have always known, it was only a matter of time before these iconoclasts moved out of the public sphere and into the private. But that day came much sooner than many of us anticipated.\n\nEnter Shaun King, one of the founders of Black Lives Matter and a doyen of the cultural elite. Last Monday, Mr. King issued gave his followers a rather disturbing order:\n\nYes, I think the statues of the white European they claim is Jesus should also come down. They are a form of white supremacy. Always have been. In the Bible, when the family of Jesus wanted to hide, and blend in, guess where they went? EGYPT! Not Denmark. Tear them down.\n\nYes. All murals and stained glass windows of white Jesus, and his European mother, and their white friends should also come down. They are a gross form white supremacy. Created as tools of oppression. Racist propaganda. They should all come down.\n\nThe Christian Post identifies King as a \"retired pastor,\" which is a pretty big stretch. In 2008, at the age of 29, Mr. King founded a church in Atlanta called \"Courageous Church\"-only to step down four years later, aged 33, because his congregation didn't really like him. \"I think in some ways I moved people too quickly for their comfort and it just didn't work,\" he explained. \"Some people really loved the changes and transitions that I was proposing, but it didn't work.\" I guess so. In fairness, destroying statues of Jesus and the saints went out of vogue with Protestants a good four hundred years ago.\n\nI'm not questioning Mr. King's faith, of course. Far be it from me to read another man's soul! For all I know, he's a devout Christian. But I think it's fair to say that his animus towards White Jesus is more political than theological.\n\nHaving said that, it's true that most Protestants still disapprove of religious statuary, even if it's been a while since they've had a good ol' Beeldenstorm . Presumably, then, Mr. King doesn't have any White Jesuses to smash-being a retired pastor and all. So, he wants to destroy someone else 's property, not his own. (Fancy that.)\n\nI wonder: has Mr. King asked non-white Catholics if they feel \"oppressed\" by White Jesus? Probably not. Thankfully, Rasmussen did, and they found that fewer than one-third of blacks agree that images showing Christ with fair skin ought to be removed.\n\nBut that's typical of guys like Mr. King. They're always ready to take offense at things that aren't offensive, on behalf of people who aren't offended themselves\n\nTake another example: the statues of Saint Junípero Serra that were destroyed in California last week.\n\nBorn in Spain at the turn of the 18 th century, Saint Junípero was a Franciscan friar who founded nine Catholic missions across the American West. Aside from winning the souls of the native peoples for Christ-something that most Christians believe is good and admirable pursuit-he was also a scathing critic of the Spanish authorities' treatment of indigenous Americans. Yet protestors complain that he \"baptized\" Spanish imperialism, and so he, too, has to go.\n\nAs for Hispanics themselves, they actually like Saint Junípero. I don't mean the decadent, self-righteous undergrads who tore the statues down, of course. They don't like anything. I mean the ones who speak Spanish in the home growing up-the first- and second-generation immigrants-the little Columbian abuelas who, like the little Polish babushkas , have pictures of White Jesus in their living rooms.\n\nCalifornia's Catholic bishops, led by Archbishop José Horacio Gómez of Los Angeles (who was born in Mexico), responded to the destruction of Saint Junípero ' statues saying that he \"was not simply a man of his times,\" but \"a man ahead of his times who made great sacrifices to defend and serve the indigenous population and work against an oppression that extends far beyond the mission era.\"\n\nIn another context, Pope Francis (who was born in Argentina) once called Saint Junípero \"one of the founding fathers of the United States, a saintly example of the Church's universality and special patron of the Hispanic people of the country.\"\n\nThat's one of the reasons why Latinos really love Saint Junípero. He reminds Hispanics-and all Catholics-that we've always had our role to play in building this country. We were not imports or add-ons, but integral members of the American experiment.\n\nYes, colonialism was often brutal. But the commingling of Spaniards and Native Americans is what created the Latino people. I doubt Saint Junípero 's critics will have much luck convincing Hispanics that the existence of Hispanics is racist against Hispanics.\n\n♦♦♦\n\nI'm not Latino myself, if you can believe it, but my mother's the descendent of English settlers and Mi'kmaq Indians. And the Mi'kmaq went through something very similar to Hispanics a few years back: a bunch of white SJWs decided that one of their saints was racist and so decided to wipe him from the history books.\n\nThe saint's name is Aspinquid, and he wasn't so much racist himself as he was a figment of the white settlers' racist imagination.\n\nThe legend goes that Saint Aspinquid was a Mi'kmaq or Abenaki chief who allegedly spread the Gospel to sixty-six tribes across America and is buried in a great tomb on Mount Agamenticus in York, Maine. It turns out that Saint Aspinquid may or may not be a myth. New England historian J. Dennis Robinson-who, when not checking white privilege, looks as though he enjoys sailing around the Cape in Nantucket Reds and drinking blueberry ale-seems to think he was.\n\nMr. Robinson writes on his blog that the myth of Saint Aspinquid is \"dangerous\" because\n\nit muddies the waters; it distracts from the already difficult search for the historic Indian leader himself without adding detail. This is a white-man's Indian-savagely romantic, culturally fascinating, potentially dangerous, even sexy-but ultimately powerless, obedient, and contrite.\n\nWhat he leaves out is that Saint Aspinquid's cultus contains practically zero white people. It's almost exclusively a Mi'kmaq thing-or, at least, it was, until the J. Dennis Robinsons of the world set out to erase his legacy. For a while, Saint Aspinquid was a kind of patron saint to the Mi'kmaq. His feast day (May 16) was to the Algonquin peoples what Saint Patrick's Day is for the Irish, or what Saint George's Day was to the English before we decided that religious observance was also racist .\n\nHere's the irony: our J. Dennis believes that his European ancestors-out of some vile sense of racial paternalism-imposed their beliefs on the Mi'kmaq by converting them to Christianity. And how does he intend to right that wrong? Why, he's going to impose his own beliefs on the Mi'kmaq, of course!\n\n♦♦♦\n\nMaybe I'm too optimistic, but I don't see this wave of destructive violence lasting much longer. Iconoclasm just doesn't sit well with Americans. That's one advantage to living in a pluralist society: we're forced to see the goodness and the beauty in faiths that we don't ourselves believe in. Whether it's a mob of SJWs tearing down a statue of Christopher Columbus in Boston or a band of Islamists desecrating the tomb of a Sufi saint in Libya, we don't abide such violent, small-minded bigots.\n\nWe lasted three months under the coronavirus lockdown before we got sick of it and went outside. I'd be surprised if this new wave of iconoclasm lasts even that long. Our republic was founded on the noble principle of not letting someone else tell you what to do-and, regardless of their religion, I firmly believe that most of countrymen will not tolerate these self-righteous, twenty-something busybodies. We don't all believe in Heaven, but all true Americans share one common creed: \"Leave me the Hell alone.\"\n\nMichael Warren Davis is the editor of Crisis Magazine.

      "text": "Since the death of George Floyd in late May, America has been embroiled in protests-protests that were, at first, animated by an assertion that the police forces of the United States mistreat black citizens.\n\nLater, however, they broadened in focus to a larger, wider assault on fundamental American values, asserting that virtually all of America's institutions have been and continue to be tainted by racism. Two of the essential elements of the ongoing protests-the Black Lives Matter organization, and The New York Times 's so-called 1619 Project-share an insidious lie at their core, a lie that ultimately prevents black Americans from participating in the best America has to offer.\n\nIn many ways, Black Lives Matter has become, essentially, an extension of the 1619 Project. The Project tells a fabricated story of America's founding. For example, it seeks to relocate our nation's founding from 1776 to 1619, when approximately 20 slaves were brought to Jamestown, Virginia. This event, from the perspective of the liberal New York Times , was the essential event that not only launched, but also defined, our new nation.\n\nThe 1619 Project asserts that slavery was the essential feature of American society and was the basis for the founders' decision to form a new country. That's bad for two reasons: not only does it teach a flawed account of their deliberations, but it also loses the story of progress, of how the words penned by Thomas Jefferson in the Declaration of Independence animated the abolition movement, and ultimately led to our nation's rejection of slavery.\n\nThe radical idea that \"all men are created equal\" is a central tenet of the Declaration of Independence. It is foundational to a world without slavery. But rather than recognize the influence this radical new idea had on the advancement of human liberty the world over, the 1619 Project is intentionally deceptive, and aims to inspire hatred for America.\n\nContrary to what the authors of the 1619 Project would have us believe, the fact that some of the same founders who embraced the language of the Declaration of Independence were also slave owners (most notably Thomas Jefferson, the Declaration's principal author), tarnishes those individuals, but not the essence of the American experiment. The 1619 Project's dogmatic approach tells us we must reject anything that came from flawed individuals, which would necessitate throwing out the entire American political system and our rich history as advocates for liberty.\n\nAs a pastor on the south side of Chicago, I have seen the devastating effects of racism on the community. I have also seen the devastating effects of other initiatives, such as the underlying messaging of the 1619 Project, and even Black Lives Matter. Because they emphasize that America is racist to its core, they both inadvertently make the American Dream inaccessible to non-whites. As a consequence of this viewpoint, blacks are doomed to view the American Dream as spectators rather than as full participants engaged in a wholehearted pursuit of their personal American Dream.\n\nAmerica is the land of opportunity. It is a place where the rule of law matters. We have economic opportunities and economic mobility that are the envy of the rest of the world. We have a free market system that rewards hard work. These are all reasons to be grateful to be an American. It is not necessary to whitewash the horrors of slavery in our nation's past to emphasize the blessings of being an American today. But, sadly, we cannot expect the 1619 Project or Black Lives Matter to acknowledge that nuance.\n\nConservatives across the country have voiced interest in countering the 1619 Project and the Black Lives Matter organization in a way that heals racial divisions and advances black lives. The answer for conservatives is to provide a positive alternative to these divisive narratives by drawing from our true history and our strengths as Americans.\n\nConservatives should first understand why the 1619 Project received so much attention in the first place. The 1619 Project authors were able to exploit the fact that Americans of all ages - but especially younger Americans - are woefully uneducated about our founding and its documents, and, consequently, the rights we enjoy as Americans. That's why, for instance, a 2017 survey from the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg Public Policy Center found that 37 percent of respondents could not name a single right protected by the First Amendment.\n\nIt is easy to see how the toxic myths of the 1619 Project could take root against that backdrop of low information about our founding. The 1619 Project and Black Lives Matter have both sought to tarnish our nation's reputation by describing our founding as a racist act that gave birth to a racist nation, unable to escape its racist past.\n\nAs conservatives seek to establish productive methods for racial healing, we face an awkward pause about how to handle our founding. How do we address the reality that some of our greatest American founders, who were passionate about the concepts of liberty, owned slaves? Here, Christianity offers us an answer. The Bible's heroes are flawed human beings - our faith teaches us that there isn't any other kind of human being. Abraham, King David, Solomon, Moses, Noah, Job, Paul, and Peter, to name just a few, are presented in the Bible with their human faults, their victories, and their triumphs. We learn that God can work powerfully through brokenness, and that He uses people who are sinners. It is a story told over and over in the Bible.\n\nThe 1619 Project asserts that our nation is inescapably racist, and - more importantly - that it was founded with the singular goal of institutionalizing slavery. That is simply wrong. What all Americans need to hear, instead, is the truth about our founding. Conservatives should never shy away from telling the story, and young black students need this message as much as white children. Our founders created the greatest system to advance liberty ever known to man, despite the fact that their work was incomplete because so many people were excluded from enjoying it.\n\nWhere the black community is today is worth celebrating precisely because we know where we started. The 1619 Project, through its intentional mishandling of history, demeans all of the progress blacks have made. What could be more racist than that?\n\nAt the same time that the 1619 Project wants us to feel ashamed about our nation's origins, the Black Lives Matter organization is pushing shame for \"white privilege.\" Everything associated with whiteness, even tangentially, is privilege - up to, and including, what BLM describes as \"the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure,\" which BLM declares its intent to \"disrupt.\"\n\nThe single greatest social pathology in America's poor urban communities is the breakdown of the nuclear family - and BLM says it wants this trend to continue, and lists its continuation as a principal goal of the organization. Think about that. Sixty years of statistics show clearly that children, particularly poor children, growing up in homes without fathers leads to much greater likelihood of poor educational performance, higher drug use, higher crime rates, higher joblessness, and less family formation - leading, sadly, to a repetition of the cycle - and Black Lives Matter thinks this is a good thing.\n\nHere, too, Christianity provides a response for conservatives. The Bible is not silent about \"privilege.\" In Luke 12:48, Jesus reminds us that \"from everyone who has been given much, much will be demanded.\" This wasn't a statement about race, but it can be applied to America's situation today. America is a blessed nation, full of people blessed beyond measure. Conservatives should turn the \"white privilege\" shaming and blaming into a call to action, not just for whites, but for Americans broadly.\n\nThe Black Lives Matter organization has borrowed sentiments from the Bible or \"Bible-sounding language\" that isn't exactly from the Bible but sounds as if it were. Christians have a responsibility to help show the truth and power of the concepts of the Bible. Forgiveness. Loving our neighbor as ourselves. Doing unto others as we would have them do unto us. These are difficult concepts that often require a lifetime of following Christ's example to get right.\n\nI am often asked how I, as a black man on the south side of Chicago, can be a conservative, given everything I see on a daily basis in my ministry work. I respond that I am a conservative not despite what I see, but precisely because of what I see happening in our community. History shows that liberal ideas fail, and they fail in devastating ways. Conservatives have not only the better messaging, but a better track record. Isn't it time we used our messaging and successes to win hearts and minds and implement an agenda of racial healing?\n\nPastor Corey Brooks is the founder and Senior Pastor of New Beginnings Church of Chicago and founder and CEO of Project H.O.O.D Communities Development Corporation.\n\nThis article appears in the September/October 2020 print issue of TAC.\n\nThis is not a paywall!\n\nYour support helps us continue our mission of providing thoughtful, independent journalism.

We have to respect that but also say to people the kinds of gatherings we're used to, the parades, the fairs - we just can't have that while we're focusing on health right now,\" de Blasio told host Wolf Blitzer.\n\nObserving the rites of the religion of Black Lives Matter is more important than anything else, because it is supreme.

But in Bill de Blasio's New York, politicized black New Yorkers and their non-black allies are supreme. Their interests are more important than slowing down the spread of a pandemic. Not you Italians, with your San Gennaro Day - cancelled! - and not you West Indian Day celebrants; yes, you are black, but you are not politically black, so you don't count.\n\nFor the record, I think the mayor is correct to cancel large events through September 30, in the interest of public health. But also for the record, let's be clear that in New York City, at least, Black Lives Matter is a supremacist political religion.\n\nI wonder what would happen if the San Gennaro organizers erected a magic circle of Black Lives Matters posters on the boundaries of Little Italy.

      "text": "Over the past weeks, we have been endlessly inundated with the same three words: \"Black Lives Matter.\" We hear them every day, on every media platform. Those words are spray-painted on buildings, streets and monuments across the country. We've also witnessed a parade of elite corporations vocally and financially supporting the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nTheir rhetoric is lofty and touching, but contradicted by their actions. As Johnny Burtka, the Executive Director of The American Conservative , pointed out on the Tucker Carlson Show: these companies have not lifted a finger to actually help or create jobs for the people they claim to support.\n\nApple has achieved great financial success by exporting jobs to foreign lands. They are happy to use foreign laborers working in substandard conditions for substandard salaries to maintain their massive profit margin. According to recent reports , workers at Apple's suppliers in China are literally enslaved.\n\nApple has stashed hundreds of billions of dollars outside of our country to avoid paying taxes. None of those dollars are creating meaningful jobs for Americans or bringing \"critical resources and technology to underserved school systems\" in America that Apple claims to care about.\n\nWhile the company talks about \"creating a better, more just world for everyone,\" we do not see any Apple assembly plants in the black neighborhoods in Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore, St. Louis or my home town of Cleveland, Ohio. A job is by far the best social program. So which black lives are Apple's actions actually supporting?\n\nWhat about Nike, whose profits depend heavily on consumers from the black community? Watchtowers, barbed-wire fences and police guard boxes surround a factory in eastern China that manufactures shoes for Nike. The imprisoned workers, reportedly members of the Uighur Muslim ethnic minority, are under constant surveillance and prohibited from practicing their religion.\n\nMeanwhile, we don't see any Nike factories in black neighborhoods in America providing desperately needed jobs. As part of its marketing program to keep black people purchasing its foreign-made products, Nike does give money to black sports and media stars. But that does nothing to create the jobs ordinary black Americans need.\n\nThese are just two prominent examples in a long list of multinational corporations that profit from the black community but will not spend their money employing black people here in America. Drive-by shootings and other senseless acts of violence take black lives in Chicago and other major cities so frequently no one in the major media seems to notice. Large corporate sponsors of political activism don't seem to care either, and don't do anything to help. Instead, they give money to activists whose agenda includes peddling excuses for the rioting and looting we've witnessed in our urban areas. How many innocent black lives have been lost or destroyed in this burning of black communities and callous destruction of black-owned small businesses?\n\nSupporting an organization that believes black fathers and black families don't matter doesn't rescue black children from poverty and failed government programs. Single black mothers have an almost insurmountable task of raising young boys to become upstanding men in their communities.\n\nAbortion rates are another reminder of how little some black lives matter. Black women are only 13 percent of the U.S. population but black abortions account for 36 percent of all abortions in the country. The CEOs in the executive suites are silent on the subject.\n\nThose \"socially responsible businesses\" who back activists calling to abolish the police would doom high crime neighborhoods, which are too often our neighborhoods, to even greater levels of violence and death. Black lives will matter less in police-free cities.\n\nAmerican corporate elites' support for made-for-TV activists is the worst form of tokenism. They hope that by simply telling us black lives matter, they can distract from their failure to support black jobs, black families and black neighborhoods. Look at what they do, not what they say.\n\nDarrell C.

      "text": "Black guy riding around flooded Louisiana has a pretty great set of questions:\n\n\"Where are the Black Lives Matter and Black Panthers? I ain't seen one Black Panther boat or one Black Lives Matter boat. All I see is our own people in the city, the Wildlife and Fisheries, and the police going in and rescuing people.\"\n\nAnd:\n\n\"All the drama that was going on with the Alton Sterling killing, they came out with guns ready to go to war. But here we go, all these people flooded out and truly in need of help and we can't find not one of them.\"\n\nNothing against him, but I wouldn't contribute to this guy's GoFundMe campaign. Give instead to a relief fund you can count on. Still, the points he makes are dead on target. Where is Black Lives Matter? Not in Baton Rouge this week, that's for sure. I guess black lives only really matter to those activists when they've been taken by cops, not when they've been saved by cops. Which is happening every single day down here. White people and black people, including Baton Rouge police officers (half of whom lost their homes), working together to save white people and black people and all kinds of people.\n\nThis doesn't make all the problems of police brutality and black violence go away. But it does put them in perspective.\n\nHey all you liberal churches up North with your Black Lives Matter banners out front - where you at? Get down here and help. All Lives Matter. The flood waters are not prejudiced. They hate everybody.\n\nThis disaster has been clarifying in many ways. Good thing BLM has $100 million in pledges from rich liberal foundations, I guess, because after this experience, they're not going to get much of a hearing down here.\n\nBut look, I have a challenge to white people who take satisfaction in this: What are you doing to help black lives, white lives, Asian lives, Latino lives, and all lives wrecked by this flood? I talked to a conservative I know yesterday, here in Louisiana, someone who is full of strong political opinions, and I came away discouraged. This person has resources and time to help, but won't do a damn thing for anybody, except sit in front of Fox News and the local news coverage and offer nothing - not a drink of water, not a bed to sleep in, not a hot meal to the homeless refugees - but opinions.\n\nUPDATE: Let me share something with you liberal readers who have your noses out of joint in the same way pro-Trump conservative readers did when I bashed Trump on Sunday with respect to the floods. I don't really expect Black Lives Matter to show up to help black flood victims any more than I expect Donald Trump to turn his eyes away from his full-length mirror to look at the people here in Louisiana suffering. My point is that the magnitude of this tragedy, and its intensity, and the way people are responding (or failing to respond) to it, casts a harsh light on the things that have dominated our political discourse in the last year.\n\nYou know what it would take to get Black Lives Matter down to Baton Rouge now? If a BRPD officer shot one of the black looters they've arrested looting black homes.\n\nUPDATE.2: Commenter JonahR makes a great point:\n\nCommenter John wrote: \"Black Lives Matter has a singular focus for its efforts: the disproportionate regularity with which black people die in police custody, as compared to suspects of any other race.\"\n\nThat's not true! Just look at BLM's own website and their own words:\n\nThey are \"committed to...doing the work required to dismantle cis-gender privilege.\"\n\nThey are \"committed to dismantling the patriarchal practice that requires mothers to work 'double shifts' that require them to mother in private even as they participate in justice work.\"\n\nThey are committed to \"freeing ourselves from the tight grip of heteronormative thinking\" and \"fostering a queer-affirming network.\"\n\nThey are \"committed to disrupting the Western-prescribed nuclear family structure.\"\n\nMost damningly, they say their commitment to destroying the nuclear family will happen \"by supporting each other as extended families and 'villages' that collectively care for one another.\"\n\nSo where are they? Where's that commitment to collective care in action? Rednecks with fanboats have now done more for black lives in and around Baton Rouge than BLM could ever accomplish with years of street theater.\n\nWhat I don't understand is why people lie on behalf of Black Lives Matter when the group is blunt and unambiguous about its larger revolutionary goals.\n\nRod Dreher is a contributing editor at The American Conservative and was senior editor at TAC for twelve years.

      "text": "A year ago, I wrote in this space about Daniel Elder, a music composer (and a man of the center left) who made a terrible mistake last year. With parts of his city (Nashville) on fire in a Black Lives Matter riot, he posted this to social media:\n\nThe reader who sent me that item added:\n\nHe will have significant career ramifications, from loss of sales of music to loss of performances and commissions. His pieces will more than likely be blacklisted by many, if not pulled by his publishers.\n\nYou are right about soft totalitarianism. It is here and it is terrifying.\n\nAs an artist, I'm terrified to speak about anything controversial because of exactly this; that I would be misunderstood or say something stupid in a moment of emotion and be destroyed for it. I keep mostly silent on social media or retweet things. But even posting articles is starting to feel like a landmine.\n\nHow are we to move forward when our first instinct is to think the worst of people? Instead of privately correcting someone or pointing out how something might be misconstrued, the best option is to incite the mob to destroy them.\n\nAnd how in the world do you create art in this environment that is in any way challenging or thought-provoking? Or a critique of the accepted cultural sacred cows? It feels very isolating sometimes and the struggle to create meaningful art riddled with great risk.\n\nMaybe I'm alone in this. I just feel like I'm one misstep away from falling off the cliff.\n\nThe reader was right about what was coming for Daniel Elder. Robby Soave at Reason updates us on the fate of Elder . His career has been destroyed. More:\n\nMany former appreciators of Elder's music expressed regret that it had come to this. One recommended that he read Robin diAngelo's White Fragility . Another expressed \"hope that you find a way to lose that hate in your heart.\"\n\nAgain, Elder's \"hateful\" rhetoric was a two-sentence objection to the fire at the courthouse. He had not condemned the broader movement at all. Yet the messages did not cease.\n\n\"Do some research and maybe some inner reflection and maybe figure out where your racist tendencies are coming from,\" wrote another critic. \"You are canceled. Black lives matter!\"\n\nWithin 24 hours, the controversy had garnered the attention of GIA Publications. In the world of choral music, GIA is not merely a publisher; it is the major publisher of religious content, thanks to its association with the post-Vatican II Roman Catholic Church. GIA was Elder's publisher, and an important source of his income. On the morning of June 1, GIA President Alec Harris and media editor Susan LaBarr contacted Elder about posting an apology.\n\nThis apology had already been written by GIA; all Elder had to do was post it. The remarks prepared on his behalf are as follows, and worth reading in full:\n\n\"Over the weekend I made a post on my social media accounts that was insensitive and wrongly-worded. I deeply apologize for the anger, offense, and harm that this post caused. While this offense was not intended, it is what was created. For this I am truly sorry.\n\n\"There is no justification that I can offer for my post. So, rather than try to offer an excuse for what was done, I offer a promise for what I will do going forward. I commit to making amends and to dialogue. I commit to continue educating myself about privilege and bias. I commit to continue seeking an understanding of the experience of others, especially the Black community. I know that working for justice requires that we each first act justly. My work begins now.\"\n\nLaBarr added that while \"we know that you write music that promotes social justice,\" this was not clear to people who had read the Instagram post.\n\n\"We're feeling time pressure on this as some people are calling for boycotts,\" added LaBarr. \"It's all very heavy.\"\n\nElder wasn't inclined to make such a groveling apology, and was dismayed to see his colleagues siding with his critics.\n\n\"I chose to be that guy who didn't issue the apology,\" he says. \"Things went from there and it wasn't good.\"\n\nWithin hours, GIA issued a denunciation of Elder.\n\n\"The views expressed in composer Daniel Elder's incendiary social media post on Sunday evening do not reflect the values of GIA or our employees,\" it read. \"GIA opposes racism in all its forms and is committed to do what Michelle Obama called 'the honest, uncomfortable work of rooting it out.'\"\n\nNote this PR statement endorses the view that Elder had made an \"incendiary\" statement. Neither Harris nor LaBarr responded to a request for clarification as to which aspect of Elder's anti-arson agenda they oppose.\n\nGIA also announced that the company would no longer publish Elder.\n\n\"We are grateful to those who brought this to our attention and to all who continue to hold individuals and organizations to account,\" the statement concluded.\n\nGIA made this announcement on Facebook. Virtually all the comments were supportive, though one person asked why the company had not scrubbed all referenced to Elder on its website. (\"What's the plan?\" asked this individual. \"Keep supporting a bigot?\")\n\nFor Elder, the consequences were far-reaching. The coronavirus pandemic had already upended his business: In the era of COVID-19, few activities had become as verboten as choir singing . Without the support of a publisher and professional network, Elder's work was impossible. Moreover, local choral directors refuse to do business with him because of the controversy. They are afraid to associate with him, or to be seen as defending him in any way.\n\n\"It's a bad look for them,\" says Elder. \"It's really quite extreme, the effect this has had.\"\n\nThe toll on Elder's mental well-being has been equally catastrophic: losing countless friends, colleagues, and fans is no small matter for an artist. He has seen a therapist and a psychiatrist, and he says he has needed to be \"talked off the ledge\" several times. Needless to say, he has struggled to compose new music since everything fell apart.\n\nRead it all.\n\nAnd listen to some of Elder's work here:\n\nHis YouTube channel is here - on it, you can hear all kinds of choral music from him. He's a very talented man, but he cannot get work, because he violated the ridiculous orthodoxy within the music community.You people who think I am exaggerating when I call this \"soft totalitarianism,\" and warn in Live Not By Lies that we are descending into ideological madness, ought to tell Daniel Elder that I'm being alarmist.\n\nYou might want to check out his blog too. Daniel Elder is a deep and discerning artist. These contemptible totalitarians who crushed this man's career simply for saying arsonists are fools - they don't realize it, but they are contributing to the hellacious backlash coming. In Spain, I spoke to a professor - a conservative - who said that if the broad middle class adopts hardcore nationalism as a reaction to militant wokeness, \"we will get fascism.\" That came to mind when I was reading an advance copy of Charles Murray's new book, Facing Reality - sure to be a blockbuster - on the train to Madrid this afternoon. Murray writes that the racial antagonism of wokeness is going to tear America apart:\n\nPerhaps the deepening polarization would have continued just because of the alienation between elites on the coasts and the people who live everywhere else. It is also plausible that the alienation between Blacks and Whites played a role. Purely on grounds of expediency, the rhetoric about White privilege and systemic racism coming from Black opinion leaders has always seemed self-defeating. Blacks, constituting 13 percent of the population, are telling Whites, 60 percent of the population, that they are racist, bad people, the cause of Blacks' problems, and they had better change their ways or else. Right or wrong, that rhetoric has been guaranteed to produce backlash by some portion of the 60 percent against the 13 percent.So far, this effect has been masked because the strategy has worked so well with White elites. Ordinarily, you can't insult people into agreeing with you, but White guilt is a real thing. In the summer of 2020, many White college students and young adults agreed that they had sinned, even though they hadn't realized it until now, and joined in Black Lives Matter marches. The New York Times, the Washington Post, NPR, PBS, CBS, NBC, ABC, CNN, and MSNBC gave sympathetic coverage to the protests and, to varying degrees, downplayed the riots and looting.\n\nMeanwhile, many middle-class and working-class Whites have not been insulted into agreement. They're just insulted, and to their minds unfairly insulted. I'm not talking about White nationalists and White supremacists - their numbers are relatively small. My concern is the extremely large majority of middle-class and working-class Whites who don't think of themselves as racists and have not behaved as racists. Tens of millions of these people live in towns that have few Black or Latino residents, and racial issues haven't impinged on their lives. They don't understand why they are being accused of racism. Still other tens of millions live in large cities where racial problems have been real, but they see themselves as having treated Black and Latino neighbors and coworkers with friendship and respect.\n\nThey believe that everyone has a God-given right to be treated equally. Now all of them are being told that they are privileged and racist, and they are asking on what grounds. They are living ordinary lives, with average incomes, working hard to make ends meet. They can't see what \"White privilege\" they have ever enjoyed. Some are fed up and ready to push back.\n\nHow widespread might the backlash be? It is one of those topics that the elite media has been unable to investigate more than superficially. But it seems beyond dispute that a growing number of Whites are disposed to adopt identity politics - to become a racial interest group in the same way that Blacks and Latinos are racial interest groups.\n\nThe question asks itself: If a minority consisting of 13 percent of the population can generate as much political energy and solidarity as America's Blacks have, what happens when a large proportion of the 60 percent of the population that is White begins to use the same playbook? I could spin out a variety of scenarios, but I don't have confidence in any of them. I am certain of only two things.\n\nFirst, the White backlash is occurring in the context of long-term erosion in the federal government's legitimacy. Since 1958, the Gallup polling organization has periodically asked Americans how much they trust the federal government to do what is right. In 1958, 73 percent said \"always\" or \"most of the time.\" Trust hit its high point in 1964, when that figure stood at 77 percent. Then it began to fall. By 1980, only 27 percent trusted the government to do what is right. That percentage rebounded to the low 40s during the Reagan years, then fell to a new low, 19 percent, in 1994. It rebounded again, hitting a short-livedhigh of 54 percent just after 9/11. Then it plunged again, hitting another new low, 15 percent, in 2011. It has been in the 15-20 percent range ever since. A government that is distrusted by more than 80 percent of the citizens has a bipartisan legitimacy problem.\n\nWhen a government loses legitimacy, it loses some of the allegiance of its citizens. That weakened allegiance means, among other things, a greater willingness to ignore the law. The federal government has enacted thousands of laws and regulations. Many of them apply to every family and every business in the nation. They cannot possibly be enforced by the police or courts without almost universal voluntary compliance. When a government is seen as legitimate, most citizens voluntarily comply because it is part of being a citizen; they don't agree with every law and regulation, but they believe it is their duty as citizens to respect them. When instead people see laws and regulations as products of the illegitimate use of power, the sense of obligation fades.\n\nEvents since the summer of 2020 make me think it is too late to talk about if Whites adopt identity politics. Many already have. That's the parsimonious way to interpret the red-blue divisions over wearing masks, the widespread belief in red states that the 2020 election was stolen, and the rage that resulted in the invasion of the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. This is all evidence that the federal government has lost its legitimacy in the eyes of many Whites. If that reaction spreads, the continued ability of the federal government to enforce its edicts in the reddest portions of the nation will be thrown into question. The prospect of legal secession may be remote, but the prospect of reduced governability from Washington is not.\n\nThe second thing of which I am certain is that Donald Trump's election and the lessons of his term in office changed the parameters of what is politically possible in America. Someone can win the presidency without having been a governor, a senator, or a general. Someone can win it without any experience in public service at all and without any other relevant experience. Someone can win with a populist agenda. Someone can govern without observing any of the norms of presidential behavior. Those lessons have not been lost on the politically ambitious of either the left or the right. All over the country, people at the outset of their political careers see a new set of possibilities. They include many who are as indifferent to precedent and self-restraint as Donald Trump was and who are more serious students of the uses of power than Trump was. It is increasingly possible that, the next time around, someone who is far more adept than Donald Trump can govern by ignoring inconvenient portions of the Constitution.\n\nI'm going to write more about the explosive Facing Reality in a separate post. Better get your copy before Amazon stops selling it. I'm serious. The point is, what the woke did to Daniel Elder - a liberal (!) who has been blacklisted by the woke left as effectively as any leftist from the McCarthy era - is a vivid, infuriating instance of the kind of thing that is going to spark the backlash Murray fears. You can't destroy people's careers like that forever without calling up a hellacious reaction. These leftist fools and their fellow travelers within American institutions have no idea what they are calling down on our country.\n\nRod Dreher is a contributing editor at The American Conservative and was senior editor at TAC for twelve years.

      "text": "What do people returning to work, organic farming, and bird names have in common? They are all battlegrounds of racial reckoning, according to liberal corporate media. This demonstrates the degree to which many on the left have sought to make race the irrepressible, reductionist centerpiece of American public discourse, in a manner similar to other radical activist movements that have sought to foreground sex, gender, or-in an older, more conventionally Marxist age-class.\n\nIn July, the Washington Post featured an article about how black women came to enjoy working from home, where they were \"free from microaggressions,\" during the pandemic. Among those interviewed was 28-year-old project specialist Funke Adeniji, who manages an Instagram account in which she \"fields tips, questions and complaints about being Black in the office world.\" As a black woman, the Post explained, \"she felt she was expected to be friendly to everyone, look presentable and field inappropriate personal questions.\"\n\nThe month before, the Post ran a large interactive story on \"Afro Indigenous regenerative agriculture\" and its battle against a \"food apartheid\" white farming industry that has contributed to climate change, which, the story notes, disproportionately affects \"black and brown folks.\" That same month the paper published another big feature on the \"racist legacy\" of bird names \"connected to enslavers, supremacists and grave robbers.\" One Asian-American ornithologist told WaPo : \"Western ornithology, and natural exploration in general, was often tied to a colonialist mind-set of conquering and exploiting and claiming ownership of things rather than learning from the humans who were already part of the ecosystem.\"\n\nOne might reasonably wonder if being friendly to everyone and looking presentable is too much to ask of employees, regardless of their skin color (of course, no one should be expected to field \"inappropriate personal questions,\" though one wonders what exactly Adeniji had been asked-the article curiously offers no further explanation). One might also ask how exactly \"Afro Indigenous regenerative agriculture\" is qualitatively different from other earlier forms of organic farming that most agrarian societies have engaged in at one time or another, besides the skin color of the farmers. And one might also wonder why Western ornithology is singled out for bearing the stamp of exploitative colonialism, when Asian and African peoples have done their fair share of conquering, enslaving, and \"claiming ownership of things.\"\n\nOf course, this dramatic shift in how we think and talk about race didn't happen overnight; its antecedents can be traced through decades. But the transformation intensified in May 2020 following the death of George Floyd. Momentum had been building since the 2013 acquittal of George Zimmerman in the shooting death of black teen Trayvon Martin, when Black Lives Matter co-founder Alicia Garza posted on Facebook: \"I continue to be surprised at how little Black lives matter... Our lives matter.\" It took seven years, but in the aftermath of Floyd's death, embrace or qualification of those three words became one of the most controversial fault lines in American society.\n\nNow one year removed from Floyd's death, Americans find it increasingly impossible to avoid the subject of race. It is not just the media that is driving the relentless narrative-\"systemic racism,\" \"anti-racism,\" \"critical race theory.\" The entertainment industry is scrambling to foreground \"persons of color.\" Companies advertise with attacks on systemic racism and highlighting their highlighting of persons of color. Professional sports leagues and their teams promise to do more to advance anti-racism. And public schools have become ground-zero of political and ideological battles over curricula informed by critical race theory.\n\nIf you aren't frequently thinking about race and racism, you apparently should be. Activists declare that it is not enough to be \"non-racist;\" one must be \"anti-racist,\" and accept various tenets and proposals proffered by anti-racist thought leaders . Everyone must participate in this nationwide anti-racist agenda, evidenced by the proliferation of anti-racist training for businesses, civil servants, educators, and police officers.\n\nIf you express disagreement with or disapproval of this far-reaching social and political project, you risk being labeled a racist yourself. White persons skeptical of anti-racism, whether its premises or various manifestations, are accused of being guilty of \"white fragility\" and seeking to protect \"white supremacist\" norms. Black persons who express similar concerns are called \"Uncle Toms.\"\n\nThe non-stop contentious political and ideological wrangling over race in America-and the increasingly higher personal and professional stakes dependent on one's opinions-is alarming, to say the least. Indeed, it recalls other times in American history when views on contentious topics-say, the two \"Red Scares\" or America's entry into World War I-were defined not only by alarmism and hysteria but attacks on various rights, including free speech and free assembly. In our own time, media outlets are willing to fire employees for alleged offenses against the new racial orthodoxies, and major vendors are willing to stop selling certain books deemed racist.\n\nReaction to books such as BLM: The Making of a New Marxist Revolution , by Heritage Foundation senior fellow Mike Gonzalez will also be instructive. By reaction, I do not necessarily mean how various media will review it-I would presume few, if any liberal corporate outlets will bother to mention it (though perhaps a few will offer a pro forma piece pillorying it for being racist or predictably red-meat conservative). Rather, I mean how certain people-say a coworker, manager, or teacher-would react to any of the information provided therein.\n\nTake for example Gonzalez's citation of the Insurance Information Institute (a nonpartisan wonky organization if ever there was one), which found that the BLM-inspired and supported riots in 2020 cost between $1 billion and $2 billion in damage, \"marking it as the costliest civil disorder in U.S. history.\" Or that of the 633 incidents in the U.S. in 2020 that the Princeton-supported Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project counted as \"riots,\" BLM activists were involved in about 95 percent of them. Or Gonzalez's extensive research showing that BLM's three founders-Alicia Garza, Patrisse Culors, and Opal Tometi-all have long-standing ties to domestic and international Marxist revolutionaries (including Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro).\n\nOne could also cite Brown University economics professor Glenn Loury-quoted by Gonzalez-who in a 2021 lecture noted that of the people fatally shot by police in the United States in a given year (there were about 1,200 fatal shootings between June 2015 and May 2016, for a high-end example), about one-fourth of victims were black, which is an over-representation of black citizens (who comprise about 13 percent of the population), but far less than the majority. Loury in the same speech also noted that there are about 17,000 homicides every year, nearly half of which involve black perpetrators, and the majority of which involve black victims. \"For every black killed by the police, more than 25 other black people meet their end because of homicides committed by other blacks,\" Loury, himself black, observed.\n\nFinally, we might consider the fact that BLM raised $90 million from individuals alone in 2020. Or that corporations including Amazon, Gatorade, Microsoft, Glossier, Airbnb, 23andMe, Unilever, Bungie, Nabisco, Dropbox, Fitbit, Devolver Digital, and Tinder contributed to a BLM war chest of corporately donated funds amounting to $1.6 billion as of December 2020. In other words, BLM is now a very wealthy liberal activist organization with incredible social and political influence and reach, akin to organizations like Human Rights Watch or the Open Society Foundations.\n\nAll of the above data points are not only facts, but easily discoverable for anyone with internet access. They may be controversial, and they may undermine certain talking points of the anti-racist movement, but they are, in a word, true . Yet imagine what response a federal worker or an employee of a major corporation might elicit if he or she were simply to cite them. Or, even more controversially, imagine what might happen to such a person if she had something like Gonzalez's book-with its provocative cover and title-visible on her desk.\n\nAnswering that question, I would propose, is even more important than discerning whether or not the BLM movement is good or bad for America, if organic farming and ornithology are systemically racist, or if critical race theory represents a fundamental attack on our national identity. That is because in an increasingly concerning number of cases, even debating the above questions is labeled unacceptable. The debate, we are told by those with the ability to decide the fates of employees and students, is already over.\n\nCasey Chalk writes about religion and culture issues for The American Conservative and is a contributing editor for the New Oxford Review.

      "text": "Watch: Grammy-nominated rapper bashes Black Lives Matter as a 'scam' in tense exchange with popular influencer\n\nThe video clip of the awkward exchange went viral on social media, racking up millions of views.\n\nA Grammy-nominated rapper slammed Black Lives Matter as a \"scam\" in a tense exchange.\n\nLil Yachty - born Miles Parks McCollum -  is a popular rapper who has been nominated for four Grammy Awards, three Billboard Music Awards, and three MTV Music Awards .\n\n'You probably wouldn't know anything about it because you don't care about black people.'\n\nHe recently made an appearance on the \"Feeding Starving Celebrities\" online cooking show. The series is hosted by Quenlin Blackwell - a massively popular social media influencer with nearly 12 million followers on TikTok , more than three million followers on Instagram , and over 2.5 million subscribers on YouTube .\n\nBlackwell asked Lil Yachty, \"You spent $100,000 on a trip to Disney World . How much have you spent on charitable causes this year?\"\n\nLil Yachty laughed and pointed out that \"this year has technically just started.\"\n\nBlackwell then asked how much he gave to charity last year.\n\nHe responds, \"It's hard to gauge.\"\n\nThe rapper added, \"It's just blurry. I've been doing so much.\"\n\nBlackwell replies, \" BLM ? Because you want to be so black-powered?\"\n\nLil Yachty quickly fires back, \"BLM is a scam.\"\n\nBlackwell excitingly orders her staff to \"clip that\" video highlight and send it to \"the f***ing news.\"\n\n\"BLM was literally a scam,\" Lil Yachty explains, then says of Black Lives Matter leaders: \"They had bought mansions.\"\n\nLil Yachty then bashes Blackwell, \"You probably wouldn't know anything about it because you don't care about black people. You don't follow black news.\"\n\n\"I do care about black people. Look at my chocolate,\" the influencer retorts as she points to her arms.\n\nLil Yachty shoots back, \"It's a disguise.\"\n\nAfter an awkward silence, Blackwell then proclaims herself to be the \"most pro-black person in this room.\"\n\nLil Yachty claims that Blackwell's staff is \"all white,\" to which she argues that her employees are \"POC,\" or \"people of color.\"\n\nA staff member is heard saying, \"I'm gay.\"\n\nThe rapper says, \"I too have a gay,\" which shocks Blackwell and compels her to correct him with the progressive term, \"A gay? A member of the LGBTQIA+.\"\n\nA video clip of the exchange went viral on social media and racked up more than one million views on the X social media platform, plus an additional four million views on the original full episode .\n\nBlaze News has extensively covered the questionable spending habits by the leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nThe Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation reportedly took in more than $90 million in 2020.\n\nBLM revealed in 2021 , \"After our expenses and grant disbursements, we are left with an approximate balance of $60 million.\"\n\nAs Blaze News reported in January 2022 , BLM co-founder Patrisse Cullors \"secretly\" purchased a $6 million mansion in Southern California. Regarding the accusations of purchasing lucrative real estate property, Cullors claimed, \"What's happening to me and to our movement is both racist and sexist.\"\n\nAt the same time, the BLM organization purportedly funded the purchase of a mansion that was formerly the Toronto headquarters of the Communist Party of Canada.\n\nIn February 2022, the liberal states of California and Washington reportedly ordered the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation to halt all fundraising operations over a lack of financial transparency.\n\nCullors - a self-described \" trained Marxist \" - resigned from the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation after questions surrounding the purchase of high-end real estate properties.\n\nLike Blaze News?

      "text": "DC mayor will remove Black Lives Matter mural and plaza over pressure from White House\n\nThe change will be a part of the nation's 250th anniversary celebration.\n\nA Black Lives Matter plaza will be removed from Washington, D.C., along with a massive mural, according to a spokesperson for Mayor Muriel Bowser (D).\n\nThe mural to the BLM movement was painted on 16th Street NW for two blocks and lies just north of the White House. It was unveiled by Bowser in June 2020 and made a permanent feature in October 2021.\n\n'We can't afford to be distracted by meaningless congressional interference.'\n\nBowser referred to a threat from Republicans in Congress to cut D.C.'s federal funding unless she got rid of the BLM mural and plaza.\n\n\"The mural inspired millions of people and helped our city through a very painful period, but now we can't afford to be distracted by meaningless congressional interference,\" she said in a statement. \"The devastating impacts of the federal job cuts must be our number one concern. Our focus is on economic growth, public safety, and supporting our residents affected by these cuts.\"\n\nWhen pressed about the issue, Bowser said that the White House was not happy about the installation, according to WRC-TV.\n\nThe mural will be replaced with a design created by schoolchildren and artists that has yet to be determined.\n\nThe change will be a part of a celebration of the national semiquincentennial, which is the 250th anniversary of the Second Continental Congress voting for the colonies' independence from Britain in 1776.\n\nOne black resident of the area told WTTG-TV that the order to get rid of the BLM installation was a \"tragedy.\"\n\nRepublican Rep. Andrew Clyde of Georgia had introduced legislation to strip D.C. of funding if its leaders did not get rid of the BLM plaza and mural.\n\nTrump also threatened to use federal power to clean up D.C. if Bowser did not take action, but he reportedly backed off on the threat after speaking with the mayor.\n\nReaction from residents and video of the mural can be viewed on the news video from WTTG on YouTube.\n\nLike Blaze News?

He was a sophomore basketball player at the University of Michigan. I was a 25-year-old journalist given my first big assignment.

The Miami Heat welcomed him into their organization as an assistant coach.\n\nIn 2019, when his alma mater named him head coach of the Wolverines, no one who followed Howard's career would have predicted that his lack of emotional control and anger toward white men would potentially wreck his coaching career.\n\nBut that's where we are today. Howard is under investigation, once again, as the University of Michigan sorts through his latest angry meltdown. This time, there is no film footage.\n\nAccording to reports, on Friday Howard engaged in a nasty confrontation with longtime Michigan strength and conditioning coach Jon Sanderson.

Your family and friends will join in the smear.\n\nWhite derangement syndrome is a mass psychosis crippling black men.\n\nI've watched it destroy Juwan Howard. Thirty years ago, Howard was one of the best young people in all of sports. In high school, he was part of the National Honor Society. He was homecoming king. He was president of his high school's Senior Boys' Council. He was the mature, steady presence on the highest-profile college basketball team of all time. He declared for the NBA after three years in college, but circled back to complete his degree in communications alongside his classmates. For two decades, NBA teams sought his leadership and intangibles. He was groomed in Pat Riley's system.\n\nJuwan Howard lived the American dream. He worked hard and used his God-given talents to elevate his station in life. From the age of 12, the basketball world wooed Howard and provided him with financial, educational, and emotional support.\n\nWhy so angry?\n\nWhite derangement syndrome requires black people to ingest and spew racial animus. That animus drives you insane and takes a toll on your physical health. Howard is an elite athlete who needed heart surgery at 50. Anger is unhealthy. So is a constant feeling of dependence.\n\nSince the rise of social media, black people have been programmed to view the world through the lens of race.

      "text": "Horowitz: Black lives matter. Empower good cops to save them\n\nThe New York Times is breathlessly accusing Minneapolis police of being seven times more likely to shoot black people than white people. What the paper fails to tell you is that black people are 12.1 times more likely to be a victim of a gun homicide in Minneapolis than white people are. So adjusting for that obvious fact, police actually have a higher rate of shooting against white suspects per interaction. According to the CDC , the black homicide rate was 12.9 times higher than the white homicide rate from 2010 to 2015, and homicide was the leading cause of death for black people under 35. That is the true travesty and tragedy of racial injustice we need to discuss.\n\nPandering is not compassion. Misdiagnosing a culture of violence in many inner cities as being fundamentally caused by the police is not only blaming the cause on the reaction, but is ignoring the true travesty of lost black lives due to unbridled gang-related crime. These crimes will only grow if police are forced to cower and retreat as they did in Baltimore after the Freddie Gray case. Crushing the police deterrent against violent crime in reaction to George Floyd's death is the equivalent of governors sending COVID-19-positive patients into nursing homes to treat the coronavirus crisis. In other words, they harm they very people they purport to protect.\n\nLiberals continue to suggest that black people are more likely to be killed by police than white people. That is utter nonsense, and as I've already proved , the opposite is true. Non-criminals who don't interact with the police - white or black - have zero chance of dying of a police shooting. What liberals fail to account for, though, is that an outsized share of the violent crime is committed by African-American criminals, which is what will most likely cause an interaction with the police. If you adjust for that fact, there is no discrimination whatsoever.\n\nHere is a list of criminal arrest charges by category of crime along with the percentage distribution of black people arrested for those crimes in 2018, according to the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting. Keep in mind that as of 2018, black people only composed 12 percent of the national population:\n\nIf you actually look at the FBI data every year, you will notice that the share of total drug or other crimes committed by black offenders - crimes that some in the political class believe to be low-level - is actually lower than their share of the more serious and/or violent crimes. It's not drugs or disorderly conduct that are responsible for the lion's share of police interactions with black suspects.\n\nIt doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that if such a disproportionate number of violent crime arrests are among black suspects, then a disproportionate number of the most volatile and violent arrests, which usually involve resistance from the suspect, will be among black suspects. Thus, it's extremely dishonest to decry the disparity in police interactions without focusing on the underlying problem of the disproportionate amount of criminal activity driving police into those neighborhoods with 911 calls. That is the true injustice that is harming black neighborhoods, where most of the people are peaceful citizens and suffer from all this crime, which is often gang-related.\n\nFor example, in Chicago, some have suggested that black people are 14 times more likely than white people to be shot by police. But black adolescents are roughly 50 times more likely to be killed by homicide in Chicago than the national average of black adolescents, much less than their white counterparts, who have an infinitesimal homicide rate by comparison.\n\nSadly, it's among this population that most of the shootings and other violent crimes occur, which will naturally draw police interaction, most of the time justified. It's like complaining that there is more chemotherapy among cancer patients than non-cancer patients. The cancer of violent crime is in black neighborhoods much more than anywhere else, and absent good police work and strong sentencing, it kills too many African-American males.\n\nIndeed, the true racial injustice in this country is the fact that a very small number of black criminals are responsible for a shockingly disproportionate amount of violent crime and property crime, which ensures that law-abiding African-Americans are disproportionately harmed relative to the rest of the population. That is the true inequality that lies at the core of the devastation of inner cities and would be the subject of a national dialogue if we actually had a mature political system.\n\nAt the heart of the violence in the inner cities are the gangs. Yet local governments are not equipped to deal with sophisticated cross-state gangs that destroy neighborhoods. It's a lot easier to pander and push legislation to release criminals and handcuff the police, but what actually would save black lives is anti-gang legislation. Sadly, when Georgia Governor Bryan Kemp tried to push commonsense gang legislation, a bipartisan collection of the leniency movement blocked his initiative .\n\nAccording to the FBI , \"Criminal gangs commit as much as 80 percent of crimes in many communities.\" Already a decade ago, it was estimated that 1.4 million gang members from over 33,000 gangs \"are responsible for an average of 48 percent of violent crime in most jurisdictions and up to 90 percent in several others.\" Again, given that most victims of violent crime are African-Americans and most gang recruiting is in their neighborhoods, the gangs are the biggest security threat to black neighborhoods. The pro-gang political class that engages in gang crisis denying are the ones who are fomenting the most dangerous form of racial inequality in the justice system.\n\nAnti-gang legislation is the proverbial fruit and vegetable diet, but the shameless pandering politicians and nonprofits would rather serve the sugar. They would rather not talk about the fact that more aggressive policing and tougher sentencing have saved roughly 4-5K black lives every year in the form of fewer black homicide victims for 25 years, relative to the homicide levels of the 1980s and early 1990s.\n\nCrime has been rising in the Minneapolis area, and much of it is driven by gangs . Hamstringing the police will lead to exponentially more deaths, as in Baltimore. Conversely, if lawmakers really cared about black lives, they would target the true source of the disparity in shootings, which is homicide by gangs. Instead, the president of the Minneapolis city council is promising to abolish the police . That would be the dream of the local gangs and would help blot out the dreams of a generation of peaceful African-American citizens struggling to avoid the crossfire.\n\nDaniel Horowitz\n\nBlaze Podcast Host"

They also demanded justice for Iyad Halak, an unarmed autistic Palestinian man killed by Israeli border police in Jerusalem last week as he walked to school.\n\nDefense Minister Benny Gantz apologized for Halak's death and one of the officers involved is confined to house arrest. A second was released from police custody but placed under restrictive conditions as the investigation continues.\n\nMany protesters made parallels between Floyd's death and Halak's.\n\n\"I think it's the same. We are talking about violence and it refers to everybody. It's a very sad story,\" Ethiopian Israeli Aviv Yossef told The Jerusalem Post. \"We said it's not just Africans here. It's also Arabs.

Hate that it reminds them of our power,' the group wrote.\n\nBut for those who have viewed the plaza more as a performative gesture than an actual counter to police violence, the demolition is seen as a victory.\n\n'The Black Lives Matter Plaza is being demolished! Because ALL lives matter,' one X user posted Monday morning.\n\n'Demolition crews move in on BLM Plaza in downtown DC- directly in front of the White House,' conservative commentator Danny De Urbina wrote. 'We will destroy your pagan temples.'\n\nCrews remove light fixtures as they begin work removing the 'Black Lives Matter' street mural and plaza in Washington, DC, on March 10, 2025\n\nThe mural's removal comes after a Republican lawmaker introduced a bill to strip funding from D.C. unless action was taken to eliminate the public work\n\nThe mural was created during the 2020 protests following the murder of George Floyd by police officer Derek Chauvin in Minneapolis, Minnesota\n\nAnother talk show host, Cash Loren, posted: 'LET'S GO! Work Crews are dismantling Black Lives Matter Plaza in DC. America wins. Marxism loses.'\n\nRep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., who introduced the anti-BLM plaza proposal, also celebrated the mural's removal on Monday.\n\n'One week after I introduced legislation to rename Black Lives Matter Plaza, workers have started dismantling it,' he posted. 'Making D.C. Great Again!'\n\nClyde's measure, which has yet to be voted on, would 'withhold certain apportionment funds from the District of Columbia unless the Mayor removes the phrase Black Lives Matter from the street.\n\nIt re-designates the area as Liberty Plaza, and removes 'such phrase from each website, document and other material under the jurisdiction of the District of Columbia.'\n\nAfter originally stating that the bright yellow BLM mural would be permanent, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser revealed last week that she will transform the plaza after the Republican's bill was introduced.\n\n'The mural inspired millions and helped our city through a very painful period,' Bowser said.\n\n'But now we can't afford to be distracted by meaningless congressional interference.'\n\nThe mural is just blocks from the White House and has been a popular meeting point for protests held in Washington\n\n'The devastating impacts of the federal job cuts must be our number one concern. Our focus is on economic growth, public safety, and supporting our residents affected by these cuts,' she said.\n\nBowser wrote on social media that the 'evolution' of the plaza will be a part of celebrating America's 250th birthday in July 2026, a nationwide effort to revamp cities and localities to commemorate the anniversary.\n\n'We have long considered Black Lives Matter Plaza's evolution and the plaza will be part of DC's America 250 mural project, where we will invite students and artists to create new murals across all eight wards,' Bowser said.\n\nConstruction on the plaza is expected to take six to eight weeks, according to the District Department of Transportation.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

How much have you spent on charitable causes?' the YouTuber, 24, asked.\n\nThe rapper, seemingly taken about by the question, tried to dismiss it by pointing out how 'this year technically just started'. But Blackwell pushed back, asking: 'What about last year? What about the year before last year?'\n\n'Oh, well that year, that's a good year, yeah,' Lil Yachty, 27, replied. 'It's just blurry, I've been doing so much.'\n\n'BLM? Because you want to be so black powered?' Blackwell cheerfully asked, but the rapper interrupted hear, declaring: 'BLM is a scam.'\n\nThe YouTuber appeared shocked by his remark, telling her viewers to 'clip that, send it to the f***ing news'. But Lil Yachty doubled down on his remark, saying: 'BLM was literally a scam. They had bought mansions.'\n\nGrammy award winning rapper Lil Yachty branded Black Lives Matter a 'scam' during an appearance on YouTuber Quenlin Blackwell's cooking show\n\nLil Yachty made reference to the organization's purchase of a $6million, 6,500-square foot Southern California mansion (pictured) that was the subject of a now dismissed civil lawsuit\n\nLil Yachty went on to claim that Blackwell 'probably wouldn't know anything about it because you don't care about Black people. You don't follow Black news.'\n\n'I do care about Black people. Look at my chocolate,' she interjected.\n\n'That's a disguise,' the rapper replied, prompting Blackwell to declare herself 'the most pro-Black person in this room'.\n\nLil Yachty then pointed out that Blackwell had an 'all white staff', but she claimed they are 'PoC', an acronym referring to a person of color.\n\nOne of Blackwell's staff is heard off camera saying, 'and I'm gay', to which Lil Yachty adds: 'I too have a gay.'\n\nThe pair's awkward conversation has gone viral on social media, with many criticizing how the exchange of 'wild comments'.\n\nBut many people are applauding Lil Yachty for calling out BLM for allegedly taking 'millions in donations' and then spending the funds on 'on luxury mansions instead of the communities they claimed to help '.\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement exploded in 2020 after George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police , with chapters across the globe raising $90million in one year.\n\nThe organization became widely accused of being a scam after it emerged that its leaders had spent a whopping $6million that was donated to the activist group to buy a 6,500-square foot Southern California mansion.\n\nThe Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation Inc, faced accusations of financial mismanagement after purchasing the property off the back of funds raised in the wake of the racial justice protests of 2020 .\n\nThe foundation said the property, which includes a home with six bedrooms and bathrooms, a swimming pool, (pictured) a soundstage and office space, is used as a campus for a Black artists fellowship\n\nBlack Lives Matter Grassroots Inc, and its co-director Melina Abdullah,(pictured at a protest in 2020) brought a civil lawsuit against the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation Inc in 2022 alleging fraud\n\nBLM also allegedly wished to keep the house purchase a secret despite three of its former leaders having reportedly filming a series of videos dining and drinking Champagne outside the estate in Spring 2021.\n\nDocuments and internal communications, previously reported on by MailOnline, alleged the luxury property's purchase was handled in ways that 'blur boundaries' between charitable use and those that would benefit some of the organization's leaders.\n\nBlack Lives Matter Grassroots Inc, and its co-director Melina Abdullah, brought a civil lawsuit against the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation Inc in 2022.\n\nBLM Grassroots , a collective of organizers, claimed the foundation raised donations off the work of a city-based BLM chapter, then defrauded the public and shut activists out of decision-making.\n\nThe fraud claim against the foundation was, in part, based on the alleged misrepresentation of the $6million Los Angeles-area compound purchased with donated funds.\n\nBut the foundation's lawyers argued that local BLM activists failed to prove they were entitled to the raised funds or that the foundation's leaders had siphoned off millions of dollars for nefarious purposes .\n\nA California judge in 2023 sided with the foundation's lawyers and dismissed the suit.\n\nThe foundation said the property, which includes a home with six bedrooms and bathrooms, a swimming pool, a soundstage and office space, is used as a campus for a Black artists fellowship. BLM chapter organizers say the donated funds were never intended for use that way.\n\nLast year, the former leader of the BLM chapter for Greater Atlanta Tyree Conyers-Page, known as Sir Maejor Page, (pictured in his mugshot) was sentenced to 42 months in federal prison money laundering and wire fraud\n\nConyers-Page was found guilty of spending $450,000 raised from 18,000 donors on tailored suits, nightclub bar tabs, an evening with a prostitute, and a mansion in Ohio. FBI officers and Toledo police are seen raising his home\n\nThe fraud lawsuit, however, was not the only scandal to surround the organization in recent years.\n\nLast year, the former leader of the BLM chapter for Greater Atlanta was sentenced to 42 months in federal prison money laundering and wire fraud.\n\nTyree Conyers-Page, known as Sir Maejor Page, was found guilty of spending $450,000 raised from 18,000 donors on tailored suits, nightclub bar tabs, an evening with a prostitute, and a mansion in Ohio.\n\nIn addition, the co-director of BLM Grassroots Melina Abdullah was accused of using the organization's funds to pay for vacations in Jamaica and her own person expenses, the Free Press reports.\n\nAbdullah has not been charged with a crime, but the California attorney general in October 2024 threatened to revoke her group's tax-exempt status if did not turn over delinquent tax filings.\n\nAbdullah denied the allegations, but reports at the time alleged that at least $8.7million in donations were 'unaccounted for'.\n\nIt is unclear if she ever turned over the allegedly delinquent filings for BLM Grassroots.\n\nIn May 2023, it was also revealed that BLM's national organization was at risk of going bankrupt after its finances plunged $8.5million into the red the year before - while simultaneously handing multiple staff seven-figure salaries.\n\nThe financial disclosures, previously reported on by MailOnline , showed the perilous state of BLM's Global Network Foundation - which officially emerged in November 2020 as a more formal way of structuring the civil rights movement.\n\nYet despite the financial controversy and scrutiny, BLM GNF continued to hire relatives of the founder, Patrisse Cullors, and several board members.\n\nBLM's Global Network Foundation was accused of to hire relatives of the founder, Patrisse Cullors, and several board members on seven-figure salaries despite reported financial troubles. Patrisse is pictured with her brother Paul Cullors who was hired to provide 'professional security services' for BLM in 2022\n\nHer brother Paul Cullors set up two companies which were paid $1.6million providing 'professional security services' for Black Lives Matter in 2022 .\n\nPaul was also one of BLM's only two paid employees during the year, collecting a $126,000 salary as 'head of security' on top of his consulting fees. He is best known as a graffiti artist, with no apparent background in security.\n\nPatrisse defended hiring him, saying registered security firms which hired former police officers could not be trusted, given the movement's opposition to police brutality.\n\nTax filings for 2021 revealed that BLM paid a company owned by Damon Turner, the father of Patrisse's child, nearly $970,000 to help 'produce live events' and provide other 'creative services '.\n\nPatrisse, who had been at the helm of the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation for nearly six years, stepped down in May 2021, amid anger at the group's financial decisions and perceived lack of transparency.\n\nMailOnline has approached BLM and Lil Yachty for comment.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

      "text": "I was called a Black Nazi for daring to question the Black Lives Matter movement. Now, amid calls for the police officer jailed for 22 years for killing George Floyd to be PARDONED, I still believe there are troubling questions over his trial...\n\nBy ESTHER KRAKUE FOR THE MAIL ON SUNDAY\n\nPublished: 20:48 EDT, 8 March 2025 | Updated: 20:52 EDT, 8 March 2025\n\n572\n\nView comments\n\nIt was a moment that convulsed America and reverberated across the world. On the fateful evening of May 25, 2020, in a street in the city of Minneapolis, lay an unarmed black man, gasping for his life. 'I can't breathe,' he said repeatedly as a white police officer seemed to press down on his neck with his knee. Then the man stopped speaking and his body became motionless.\n\nThe life of 46-year-old George Floyd was over. But the explosive fallout from his death was about to begin. The day after Floyd died in police custody, Minneapolis saw huge protests, which by nightfall had descended into violence, complete with vandalism and attacks on the police.\n\nWorse rioting followed over the next four days, forcing the police to abandon one of their precinct buildings in unprecedented scenes of disorder. Soon, with millions watching the footage of Floyd's death on their phones and in some cases frustrated after months of Covid lockdown , violent unrest was sweeping through America's cities, accompanied by angry demands for racial justice led by the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nThe fury of demonstrators was all the more intense because George Floyd 's final, harrowing moments captured on video served as a metaphor for the darkest fears about police racism and brutality. Just as the image of Floyd's face became a symbol of the fight for equality, so his agonising last words, 'I can't breathe', were turned into a battle cry against oppression.\n\nThe police remained the prime target for the rioters' discontent, reflected in calls to slash their budgets or even 'defund' them entirely. And the immediate focus was on ensuring that the men seen as directly responsible for Floyd's death were held to account for their actions, particularly Derek Chauvin , the officer who had played the central role in restraining Floyd with his knee. He and three colleagues - Tou Thao, Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane - were put in the dock in early 2021.\n\nThe trial was presided over by Judge Peter Cahill, who rejected all requests to delay it because of the incendiary prevailing atmosphere, which had the potential to undermine the fairness of proceedings. To cheers from Black Lives Matter activists and other radical groups, Chauvin was found guilty of second-degree murder and was sentenced to 22 years in prison. The other three were jailed on lesser charges of aiding manslaughter.\n\nGeorge Floyd's face became a symbol of the fight for equality, while his last words, 'I can't breathe', were turned into a battle cry against oppression\n\nAround the world, the relief at the outcome was widespread. Soon after the jury had reached its verdict, President Joe Biden declared that the case 'had ripped the blinders off for the whole world to see systemic racism'. In an even more extravagant vein, Nancy Pelosi, the Democrat Speaker of the House, thanked Floyd 'for sacrificing your life for justice'.\n\nYet the killing of George Floyd also generated a climate of hysteria over race. Suddenly, 'white privilege', 'unconscious bias', 'decolonisation', 'critical race theory' and 'cultural humility' were phrases we all began to hear.\n\nAs a black woman journalist and commentator, I experienced this myself. At one point, when I dared question some aspects of the BLM movement, I was maligned as the worst kind of racist and even - absurdly - called a 'black Nazi'.\n\nDerek Chauvin, whose very name is synonymous with racist evil, is like the hate figure Emmanuel Goldstein in George Orwell's novel 1984, designated by the state as an enemy of the people. But given the backdrop of turmoil in America in early 2021, it is now legitimate to ask whether he really received a fair trial. The willingness even to pose such a question would provoke outrage among liberals and would be seen by some as an act of racism in itself.\n\nBut that kind of overblown hostility to any scrutiny is in fact precisely why we should revisit this episode. Justice will not be protected by censorship and insults.\n\nEver since 2021, there have been voices expressing doubts about the verdict. One is that of Liz Collin, the former CBS reporter whose film, The Fall Of Minneapolis, disputes much of the conventional wisdom about the case. Commentators like Tucker Carlson have been just as sceptical, warning of the danger that 'facts' can be twisted to fit an agenda.\n\nLast week, conservative influencer Ben Shapiro launched a petition calling on President Trump to pardon Chauvin on the grounds that Floyd was not 'murdered' at all but died from the impact of a drug overdose on a pre-existing heart condition. Shapiro published a letter addressed to the President on his site The Daily Wire claiming that Chauvin was 'unjustly convicted,' writing: 'Make no mistake - the Derek Chauvin conviction represents the defining achievement of the woke movement in American politics.' Such a call would have been unthinkable only four years ago. But as the election of Trump proves, there is a growing backlash against the woke world view.\n\nSo is the conviction of Chauvin really open to challenge? To find a possible answer, we have to go back to that tragic evening in 2020. The events that led to Floyd's death began when a store clerk contacted the police to report that Floyd had just made a purchase with a counterfeit $20 bill.\n\nGeorge Floyd's final, harrowing moments were captured on video, with Derek Chauvin holding his knee against the man's neck\n\nThe day after Floyd died in police custody, there were huge protests, which by nightfall had descended into violence, complete with vandalism and attacks on the police\n\nImmediately, Chauvin, an experienced officer with almost 20 years in the city force, was dispatched to the scene with his three colleagues, Kueng, Thao and Lane. Ironically in light of the subsequent race furore, the quartet was very diverse, with Thao of Asian heritage and Kueng hailing from a mixed-race background. Chauvin, too, had never been accused of racism. If he had been, the prosecution would have ruthlessly exploited such a fact at his trial.\n\nWhen the officers turned up to question Floyd, they found him behind the wheel of his parked car, with two other people in the back - an alleged drug dealer called Morries Hall and a woman named Shawanda Hill, who was also said to be a supplier. The police quickly saw that Floyd was in an agitated state, rocking back and forth, crying and apparently concealing drugs in his mouth. In an attempt to play the victim, he at once told officials two lies. 'I just lost my mum,' he said, though she had actually died two years earlier.\n\nSecondly, he claimed that last time he was questioned by police 'I got shot'. This again was untrue. In 2019 he was stopped in his car by another officer on suspicion of using drugs but no shot was fired.\n\nIn fact, the incident was remarkably similar to the one in May 2020, as Floyd, having eaten the drugs in his mouth, grew agitated and had to be restrained before he was taken to hospital.\n\nIn May 2020, Floyd begged the officers not to shoot him. They had no intention of doing so. They just wanted to question him and carry out a search for further fake bills or drugs. But they soon ran into trouble, as Floyd would not leave his car. 'Stop resisting,' Shawanda Hill wisely said from the back. But he did the opposite, and a ruck began. At one stage the officers managed to push him into the back seat of their vehicle, from where he complained of claustrophobia and anxiety, while he also said he 'could not breathe'. Tellingly, this was before he was on the ground with Chauvin's knee against him.\n\nWith his lengthy criminal record, Floyd always made a slightly incongruous international hero. His convictions included theft, drug possession and dealing, criminal trespass and aggravated robbery, for which he received a four-year jail term. So the allegation that day of using a counterfeit bill was just the latest in a catalogue of offences.\n\nSo many jobs, government grants and consultancies are tied to the belief that Chauvin was a racist murderer that there is tremendous pressure to stick to the story, writes Esther Krakue\n\nStill agitated and struggling, Floyd ended up on the ground beside the police car.\n\nPrecisely what happened next is critical. One of the most vexing questions at Chauvin's trial was whether the method he adopted against Floyd - leaning on him with his knee on the suspect's neck - was officially sanctioned or not. Minneapolis police chief Medaria Arradondo testified under oath that his department did not train officers to use the technique.\n\nHowever, the department's own training manual appeared to instruct officers in just such a method, known as the 'Maximal Restraint Technique'. In Liz Collin's film, several officers express their indignation at their chief's perceived dishonesty about MRT.\n\nThere were also claims at the trial that the police were indifferent to Floyd's wellbeing. After Chauvin's conviction, Tim Walz, the Democratic governor of Minnesota and later Kamala Harris's vice-presidential running mate, remarked that in the Floyd video 'the lack of humanity is sickening'.\n\nI have my own doubts about this. It was Chauvin's team, after all, who called for emergency medical support. The ambulance arrived late, but that was not the fault of the police.\n\nOf greater consequence was the autopsy report, which highlighted compelling evidence that Floyd might not have been killed by the police at all. And here, in a disturbing twist, the progressive political establishment stands accused of interfering with the proper judicial process to ensure that Chauvin ended up behind bars - and that the narrative of 'police oppression' was maintained.\n\nSuffering from hypertension and other cardiovascular problems, as well as a tumour in his pelvis, Floyd was not a well man, according to Hennepin County examiner Andrew Baker. The autopsy was conducted by Baker, who wrote in his initial report that he found no signs of asphyxiation or strangulation, and no bruising on Floyd's neck or back, though Baker had discovered significant quantities of the opioids fentanyl and methamphetamines in his system. These could have exacerbated Floyd's existing heart condition.\n\nWith the mob on the rampage against the police, the initial autopsy report was not what the authorities or Floyd's liberal supporters wanted to hear at all. In fact, complaints soon flooded in to Baker's office. After a meeting with six FBI officers and other state officials, Baker agreed that his report should emphasise that pressure to the neck had been a major factor. This was backed up by a second autopsy report, commissioned by the Floyd family, which came to the conclusions that were seemingly wanted.\n\nThere were other aspects of the trial that ensured the 'right' results were achieved. The jury was not sequestered until its final deliberations, so its members were always aware of the anger of the protesters. Indeed it is hard to see how they could have remained impartial, especially when politicians like congresswoman Maxine Waters threatened more unrest if a guilty verdict were not returned. 'We've got to stay on the streets and get confrontational,' she told the press during the trial.\n\nThere is a sense in liberal circles that this case is untouchable - because to doubt the guilt of Chauvin would be to destroy the underpinnings of the BLM movement and the global 'diversity, equity and inclusion' industry. So many jobs, government grants and consultancies are tied to the belief that Chauvin was a racist murderer that there is tremendous pressure to stick to the story.\n\nGiven the number of questions and inconsistencies surrounding the case, a judicial review and potential retrial seem to be the least that Derek Chauvin deserves. If he is truly guilty, let justice be served after a cold-hearted look at the facts.\n\nBut nearly four years on, we must ask: was justice truly served, or was Chauvin simply a scapegoat for a nation's collective guilt?\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

The newspaper said that the total number donated was $30,498,722.\n\nOf that $30.4 milliion, $4.5 million went to non-profits that are run by known BLM supporters and associates. Despite the massive donations, BLM posted losses of $8.5 million for 2021.\n\nOne group that was a recipient of a grant was the Tamir Rice Foundation, named for the 12-year-old Cleveland boy who was shot dead by Timothy Loehmann, a 26-year-old white police officer, in 2014.\n\nThe foundation, run by Rice's mother, has been critical of Black Lives Matter in the past. 'They are benefiting off the blood of our loved ones, and they won't even talk to us, Samaria Rice told the Post in 2021.\n\nThe biggest grant given out by BLM went to the Love Not Blood Campaign, a group set up by Cephus Johnson following the shooting death of his nephew, Oscar Grant, by a police officer in Oakland in 2009.\n\nGrant was played by Michael B. Jordan in the award-winning movie Fruitvale Station, detailing the shooting.\n\nIt has recently emerged that BLM is suffering a financial crisis after donations tanked amid reports of opulent spending by board members\n\nOther recipients included the Trans Justice Housing Project in Atlanta, which got $200,000, the same amount was given to the group Reuniting African Descendants while the Michael Brown Chosen for Change Foundation was given nearly $300,000.\n\nThat foundation had its non-profit status taken away by the IRS over a failure to provide proper returns.\n\nBrown's shooting death in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 at the hands of police officer Darren Wilson caused national outrage.\n\nThe Post report details that between 2020 and 2021, donations to BLM sank by $67 million from $76 million to just $9.2 million.\n\nOn Friday, it was reported that Patrisse Cullors has been quietly let go from her Warner Bros TV deal after producing no content.\n\nThe BLM activist posted a message on Instagram just days ago accusing the media of 'lying' about her.\n\n'For the last 2.5 years I've been relentlessly attacked by the media. So many lies and so much mis and disinformation. They are hell bent on destroying my life,' she wrote. 'Even though I've not been at BLM since 2021 my face continues to be used to spread so many untruths. I'm exhausted and I fear for my life daily.

He is best known as a graffiti artist, with no background in security.\n\nPatrisse Cullors defended hiring him, saying registered security firms which hired former police officers could not be trusted, given the movement's opposition to police brutality.\n\nFor the previous year, 2021, tax filings revealed that BLM paid a company owned by Damon Turner, the father of Cullors' child, nearly $970,000 to help 'produce live events' and provide other 'creative services.'\n\nCullors resigned in May 2021 .\n\n'While Patrisse Cullors was forced to resign due to charges of using BLM's funds for her personal use, it looks like she's still keeping it all in the family,' said Paul Kamenar, an attorney for the National Legal and Policy Center watchdog group.\n\nShalomyah Bowers, who took over from Cullors when she resigned, also benefitted handsomely from the group: in 2022, his consultancy firm was paid $1.7 million for management and consulting services, the Free Beacon reported.\n\nAnd the sister of former Black Lives Matter board member Raymond Howard was also employed in a lucrative role as a consultant.\n\nDanielle Edwards, who runs a consultancy firm, New Impact, was hired by BLM GNF.

A consulting firm run by Shalomyah Bowers, who is BLM's board secretary and has previously served as deputy executive director, was paid more than $1.7 million\n\nCullors admitted to AP that her group was ill-equipped to handle the finances of a charity which received $90 million the year after George Floyd was killed - but denied any wrongdoing.\n\nCullors issued a statement denying she used the $6 million LA property for personal purposes, but then had to backtrack and admit she had used the compound for purposes that were not strictly business.\n\nThe activist also amassed a $3 million property portfolio of her own, including homes in LA and Georgia, although there is no suggestion of any financial impropriety.\n\nIt is not known if the group paid out lucrative contracting fees to Cullors' friends and family past June 2022, when a new board of directors was brought in.\n\nThe board is now led by nonprofit adviser Cicley Gay, who has filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy three times since 2005.\n\nGay was ordered by a court to attend financial management lessons, and at the time of her appointment in April 2022 had more than $120,000 in unpaid debt.\n\nShe was one of three people appointed to the board, the organization said in a tweet. She subsequently was described as being chair of the board.\n\nShe told The New York Times she had been appointed to straighten out the organization's finances, after BLMGFN faced intense scrutiny over its spending of donor cash.\n\n'No one expected the foundation to grow at this pace and to this scale,' said Gay.\n\n'Now, we are taking time to build efficient infrastructure to run the largest Black, abolitionist, philanthropic organization to ever exist in the United States.'\n\nIt later emerged that Gay has been declared bankrupt three times, according to federal reports obtained by The New York Post .\n\nGay, a mother of three, filed for bankruptcy in 2005, 2013 and 2016.\n\nCicely Gay, 44, was appointed to the board of directors of Black Lives Matter's Global Network Foundation in April 2022\n\nBLMGFN has faced intense questions about its handling of donations, which surged in particular during the George Floyd protests in the summer of 2020.\n\nThe organization in February 2021 said it had taken in more than $90 million in 2020 and still had $60 million on hand.\n\nLast year, it was down to $42 million, while the Free Beacon reports BLM has now spent two thirds of the $90 million cash it had to hand.\n\nCullors, the co-founder of the organization, resigned in May 2021 as director of BLMGNF, amid scrutiny of her own property empire. She has written best-selling books, and has a contract with Warner Brothers to produce content.\n\nThen in April 2022 it emerged that BLMGFN had bought a mansion in Los Angeles for $5.8 million, which they said was to be used as a 'safe space' for activists and for events.\n\nThe organization responded to the reports in a lengthy Twitter feed, with the group noting that more 'transparency' was required going forward.\n\nBlack Lives Matter has apologized following an expose that detailed how the organization had used donations to purchase a $6 million home in Los Angeles\n\nIn a lengthy Twitter thread on Monday morning, the group vowed to be more transparent in the future\n\n'There have been a lot of questions surrounding recent reports about the purchase of Creator's House in California. Despite past efforts, BLMGNF recognizes that there is more work to do to increase transparency and ensure transitions in leadership are clear,' it stated.\n\nBLM then proceeded to blame the media for the furore and the 'inflammatory and speculative' reports that saw journalists probing the group's financials saying that it 'caused harm'\n\nThe reports 'do not reflect the totality of the movement,' the organization claimed.\n\n'We know narratives like this cause harm to organizers doing brilliant work across the country and these reports do not reflect the totality of the movement,' one of the tweets reads. 'We apologize for the distress this has caused to our supporters and those who work in service of Black liberation daily.'\n\n'We are redoubling our efforts to provide clarity about BLMGNF's work,' noting an 'internal audit' was underway together with 'tightening compliance operations and creating a new board to help steer to the organization to its next evolution.'\n\nThe organization also criticized the original New Yorker article, pictured above, describing it as 'inflammatory and speculative'\n\nBLM co-founder Patrisse Cullors (above) came under fire last year for a slew of high-profile property purchases. She resigned in May 2021 and has called reports investigation the $6 million mansion 'despicable' and claimed that criticisms against her are 'sexist and racist'\n\nThe home features six bedrooms and a pool in the back. BLM claimed the home was bought to provide a safe house for 'black creativity' but had allegedly tried to hide the home's existence\n\nThe mansion comes complete with a sound stage (pictured) and mini filming studio which the group had used in one of its video campaigns\n\nBLM attempted to justify the purchase of the mansion by saying it was made to encourage 'Black creativity' with the property 'a space for Black folks to share their gifts with the world and hone their crafts as we see it.'\n\nThe organization also went on to defend how the funds the group raised were spent including the $3 million used for 'COVID relief' and a further $25 million dollars to black-led organizations.\n\n'We are embracing this moment as an opportunity for accountability, healing, truth-telling, and transparency. We understand the necessity of working intentionally to rebuild trust so we can continue forging a new path that sustains Black people for generations,' the group wrote.\n\nThe barrage of tweets, which notably had their comments turned off, ended with the group announcing they were 'embracing this moment as an opportunity for accountability, healing, truth-telling, and transparency' and 'working intentionally to rebuild trust.'\n\nInternal memos from BLM revealed the group wanted to keep the purchase secret, despite filming a video on the home's patio in May\n\nThe Studio City home - which sits on a three-quarter-acre lot - boasts more than half-dozen bedrooms and bathrooms, a 'butler's pantry' in the kitchen (pictured)\n\nConcerns over the groups finances have swirled for years with BLM coming under intense scrutiny in the past.\n\nIn February 2022 the group stopped online fundraising following a demand by the California attorney general tho show where millions of dollars in donations received in 2020 went.\n\nThe group said the 'shutdown' was simply short term while any 'issues related to state fundraising compliance' were addressed.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

      "text": "BLM leader rages over Daniel Penny verdict in furious debate with TV anchor\n\nBy ALEXA CIMINO FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 11:08 EDT, 10 December 2024 | Updated: 14:45 EDT, 10 December 2024\n\n288\n\nView comments\n\nA Black Lives Matter leader who said 'America is inherently racist' got into a heated debate with a TV anchor who hailed Daniel Penny as a hero following the blockbuster verdict that found Penny not guilty.\n\nOn Monday, Penny, a 26-year-old Marine veteran, was acquitted of criminally negligent homicide in the death of Jordan Neely , a homeless man. The incident, which occurred last spring on a New York City subway, sparked widespread public debate.\n\nPenny was initially charged with second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide, facing up to 15 years in prison. After prosecutors dropped the manslaughter charge, the jury deliberated on the remaining charge and found Penny not guilty, prompting cheers and applause in the courtroom after days of tense anticipation.\n\nThe fiery exchange Monday between BLM of Greater New York co-founder Chivona Newsome and NewsNation's Dan Abrams began when Abrams asked if she held Neely accountable for his actions on the subway.\n\nNewsome dismissed the notion, arguing that if Neely had been white, his behavior would have been attributed to struggles like the opioid crisis, mental illness, or hunger.\n\n'If Jordan Neely was a white man, we'd be saying it was the opioid crisis. He was hungry, he was mentally ill, he had a muffin in his pocket,' she said.\n\nAbrams countered by noting that most witnesses to the incident were people of color, challenging Newsome's claim that the case was shaped by racial bias.\n\nNewsome highlighted testimonies from a white passenger who expressed fear of Penny and a Latino man who restrained Neely's arm, asserting that racial dynamics played a role in the outcome.\n\n'What about the white man during cross-examination who said he was afraid of Daniel Penny? The one who poured water on his head and said that he was afraid - he was a white man,' Newsome argued. 'What about the Latino man who was holding his arm?'\n\nBlack Lives Matter co-founder Chivona Newsome and NewsNation anchor Dan Abrams engaged in a heated debate over the Daniel Penny verdict\n\nPenny was found not guilty of criminally negligent homicide on Monday, after the state dismissed the top charge of manslaughter\n\n'If Jordan Neely was a white man, we'd be saying it was the opioid crisis. He was hungry, he was mentally ill, he had a muffin in his pocket,' Newsome said to Abrams.\n\n'I'm not the one identifying everyone by race,' Abrams retorted.\n\nThe debate grew more tense as Abrams acknowledged systemic disparities in media and justice but argued this case was unique.\n\n'Even the prosecutors conceded: Daniel Penny had every right to go hands-on, and the question became when he should have stopped - I understand that,' he said.\n\nNewsome responded by focusing on Penny's Marine Corps training, arguing that he exceeded appropriate limits by holding Neely in a chokehold for six minutes, even after Neely's body went limp. She accused Penny of showing no remorse and questioned why he laughed while law enforcement attempted to revive Neely.\n\n'Let me break it down for you: a blood chokehold, which he did, you're only supposed to hold someone in that move for 8-13 seconds. You're not supposed to do it longer than two minutes. Why did Daniel Penny, when the train was completely clear, hold Neely for six minutes?' Newsome asked.\n\n'Because he was scared,' Abrams replied.\n\n'A Marine is scared of someone he labeled as a crackhead?' she shot back.\n\nAbrams defended the jury's decision, suggesting Penny acted to protect subway passengers, which he said was central to the acquittal.\n\nNewsome, however, argued that Penny's actions were deliberate and criticized the jury as racially biased, even suggesting that anti-Black attitudes could exist among Black jurors.\n\n'America is inherently racist. I think even Black people can be anti-Black,' she said.\n\nShe also accused Abrams of avoiding coverage of footage showing Penny laughing while law enforcement administered life-saving efforts to Neely.\n\n'I'm critical of the police, right? NYPD tried saving [Neely's] life,' she said, questioning why the NYPD would try to help Neely if Penny was supposedly a 'hero.'\n\nThe two also clashed over Neely's behavior leading up to the incident. Abrams argued that Neely had frightened passengers, implying his prior behavior was relevant.\n\nNewsome countered, asserting that encountering mentally ill individuals on the subway doesn't justify lethal force.\n\n'Everyone who's ridden the New York City subway has encountered mentally ill people...we don't kill them. We offer help or get out of the way,' Newsome said.\n\nThe segment concluded with Abrams maintaining that Penny's actions were heroic, while Newsome dismissed such claims as a dangerous misrepresentation of the events.\n\n'He lied in the Fifth Precinct. Can we stop calling him a hero?' Newsome argued.\n\n'I do view what he did as heroic,' Abrams said.\n\nThe heated courtroom debate and public reaction to Penny's acquittal didn't end there. A Black Lives Matter leader, Walter 'Hawk' Newsome, Chivona's brother, who claims to be Jordan Neely's uncle and was present daily during the trial, issued a controversial call to action following the verdict.\n\nAfter the jury announced its decision, Newsome caused a stir inside the courtroom by shouting at Penny, 'It's a small f---ing world, buddy.' Speaking to the media and protesters outside the courthouse, he advocated for the rise of 'Black vigilantes.'\n\nPenny held Neely on the subway car floor while others assisted on May 1, 2023\n\n'Everybody else has vigilantes. We need some Black vigilantes,' he declared. 'People want to jump up and choke us and kill us for being loud. How about we do the same when they attempt to oppress us?'\n\nMeanwhile, tensions escalated among protesters across the street from the courthouse, where chants of 'f--k the police' echoed. Protesters criticized the police for not patrolling the subway to protect Neely, who had been shouting threats and alarming passengers before Penny intervened.\n\nProtesters outside the courthouse referred to Penny as the 'subway strangler,' warning that there would be 'no peace without justice.' Penny's lawyer argued these chants amounted to threats against the jury.\n\nThe trial, which lasted over six weeks with a two-week jury selection process, saw protesters standing outside the courtroom daily, often in harsh weather, to express their discontent.\n\nOn Monday, after calling for Black vigilantes, Walert 'Hawk' Newsome expressed his admiration for those steadfast protesters, naming several individuals who had been present every day.\n\nNewsome also told the crowd that Black people could no longer rely on authorities to protect them or recognize the value of their lives, reinforcing his call for self-reliance and resistance.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

      "text": "Black Lives Matter protests were given 'tacit' support by Scotland's political elites during lockdown, inquiry told\n\nBy DAN BARKER\n\nPublished: 15:55 EDT, 24 February 2025 | Updated: 15:55 EDT, 24 February 2025\n\n2\n\nView comments\n\nBlack Lives Matter protests were given 'tacit support' by Scotland's political elite because they were on trend despite pandemic health concerns, an inquiry has heard.\n\nBut marches which were not in vogue were condemned, the Scottish Covid-19 Inquiry was told yesterday.\n\nA youth gathering at the same time as the mass protests sparked by the death of George Floyd in the USA were heavily rebuked by Scotland's politicians.\n\nRepresentatives of the Scottish Police Federation also told how they felt Police Scotland 'willingly' failed to look after the health and safety of officers, minutes were not taken for key meetings, and that Nicola Sturgeon 's government were 'dismissive' of the force throughout the pandemic.\n\nThe shocking claims come as Lord Brailsford's inquiry investigates how Scotland's justice systems were impacted by the pandemic.\n\nCalum Steele, who served as the federation's general secretary for 15 years until 2023, yesterday told the probe there was not a consistent approach to gatherings and events throughout the crisis.\n\nMr Steele said the 2020 protests 'provided an opportunity for people to take to the streets regardless of whether they believed in the cause or whether they didn't'.\n\nHe told the inquiry in Edinburgh : 'Because there was political sympathy for the protest movement that arose following the death of George Floyd and the toppling of the Edward Colston statue, the condemnation of the breaking of Covid restrictions from politicians was an awful lot softer than other instances where people gathered.'\n\nThe Scottish Government was accused of turning a blind eye to lockdown-breaking BLM protests because of 'political sympathy' for the cause\n\nCalum Steele, the former general secretary of the Scottish Police Federation, said there was 'inconsistent messaging' from politicians during the pandemic\n\nHe told how a gathering of teenagers in Glasgow's Kelvingrove Park around the same time was met with 'almost vitriolic' condemnation from politicians.\n\nAnd, he said, the police response to that rule break was 'very firm in contrast with the protests that were taking place in and around Glasgow' at the time which were 'much more sympathetic'.\n\nHe said: 'And I know from other discussions that took place in other environments that the Cabinet Secretary for justice at that time, Humza Yousaf, referred to the Scottish Police Federation as a disgrace about our approach to that particular issue.\n\n'We took no truck to whether your protest was justified or whether it was unjustified, it was the fact that there was inconsistent messaging in the midst of a pandemic that police officers were expected to respond to.\n\n'You can't overtly condemn and expect a firm approach on this instance, but be sympathetic and expect a soft approach in that instance.\n\n'It made policing really, really problematic.'\n\nIn his written evidence, published as he was speaking to the inquiry, he said that there were protests the following week from those which 'would be categorized as being from the right that were heavily criticised' but that 'in terms of the public health challenge being faced, they were both as bad as each other'.\n\nA Black Lives Matter protest in Glasgow in 2020, which took place whilst Scots were being urged to stay at home to protect the NHS\n\nAs part of the written submission, he said: 'You can argue with the politics of what cause you were representing, or which one was moral, and which one was not, but in terms of the messaging on the public health aspect, they were giving tacit support to one body but condemning another.\n\n'The in-vogue causes were supported while the counter-cause was condemned, and the police were stuck in the middle of all of that asking what on earth was going on.'\n\nAlso giving evidence was David Hamilton, who was chairman of the federation during the pandemic, and Brian Jones, the vice-chairman of the organisation.\n\nMr Hamilton, who is now Scottish Information Commissioner, told how there were meetings where there 'didn't appear to be a record kept' and there 'wasn't minutes' of which caused them concern.\n\nHe said they were told details were being kept on another system, but never saw them, so 'very quickly we realised that we would have to keep our own records'.\n\nMr Hamilton, who told how decisions had been taken outside the key meetings, added: 'There's potential we've missed a lot of learning because we don't have proper, documented records of decision making and discussions..'\n\nDuring the pandemic the Scottish Police Federation assembled an expert group to offer independent advice on the virus, which Mr Steel said was 'ignored' by the Scottish Government and Police Scotland because 'it gave answers to questions that they did not want to ask and that they did not want to hear the answers to'.\n\nHe said: 'It is my belief, even to this day, that whilst the police service gave an effective policing response to the public during Covid it fundamentally failed the police officers it has a responsibility to look after from a health and safety perspective and willingly did so because they ignored the problems that were put before them from that panel of experts, principally in respect of the risk of transmission of disease from likes of breath tests from not having sufficient PPE.'\n\nMr Hamilton told the inquiry how society relies on policing, but the 'value of policing was totally, totally discounted by the Scottish Government'.\n\nHe told David Turner, junior counsel to the inquiry: 'I think their approach throughout the pandemic was very dismissive and \"it's just the police, it's just the police', and they didn't value officers.\n\n'And that's something which, as a thread, ran through from the very beginning to the very end in terms of how they were treated.'\n\nThe inquiry continues.\n\nShare what you

We need some black vigilantes,' he said.\n\n'People want to jump up and choke us and kill us for being loud, how about we do the same when they attempt to oppress us.'\n\nThe comments came as protesters across the street set their sights on police, chanting 'f**k the police' and questioning why they weren't patrolling the train to defend Neely.\n\nWalter 'Hawk' Newsome, who says he is Jordan Neely's uncle, threatened Penny inside the courtroom during the chaos which immediately followed the verdict\n\nSpeaking to media and later protesters outside the courthouse, Newsome said it was time for 'black vigilantes.'\n\nPenny was found not guilty of negligent homicide on Monday, after the state dismissed the top charge of manslaughter\n\nThe homeless, mentally ill black man had been threatening to kill people and telling commuters he was willing to 'go back to Rikers' when Penny, then just 24, intervened and took him to the ground.\n\nHe held Neely in a chokehold, alternating between applying pressure and not, in an effort to keep commuters safe until police arrived.\n\nProtesters have stood outside the courtroom every day of the mammoth trial. It took two weeks to even select a jury, followed by four weeks of evidence, and then six days of deliberations.\n\nThose protesters called Penny the 'subway strangler' and warned that there would be 'no peace without justice', which Penny's lawyer argued was a direct threat to jurors.\n\nOutside the courthouse on Monday, after calling for black vigilantes, Newsome told those same protesters he 'loves them.'\n\nHe singled out several by name who have been there 'every day, in the freezing cold' shouting insults at Penny.\n\nNewsome told the crowd that black people could no longer rely on authorities to keep them safe or place value on their lives.\n\nThe courtroom erupted after the not guilty verdict, as Penny was ushered out of the courtroom\n\nNeely was a Michael Jackson impersonator who was known and recognized in Times Square (pictured in 2009)\n\nPenny held Neely on the subway car floor while others assisted on May 1, 2023\n\n'We patrol our community,' he said. 'We keep us safe.'\n\n'America will never fix the issue of black people because America needs a punching bag. They have designated us as the punching bag.\n\n'So, f**k America. How dare you laugh and cheer when someone gets away with murdering us. I don't want a march. I want a step.\n\n'Racists: burn in hell.'\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper .\n\nBLM Inc. executive director Mark Fisher joined 'Fox & Friends' to discuss his reaction to rampant protests against President Trump and Elon Musk and why his left-wing political beliefs evolved.\n\nRapper Lil Yachty told cooking show host and influencer Quenlin Blackwell that Black Lives Matter (BLM) \"was literally a scam\" on an episode of her popular YouTube show.\n\nBlackwell, who hosts \"Feeding Starving Celebrities\" on the video-sharing platform and talks to various famous guests, asked Yachty how much he's spent on charitable contributions so far this year. When the rapper mentioned that the year had just started, the host asked what contributions he'd made over the previous two years, also asking if BLM was one of the causes he's donated to.\n\n\"What about the year before last year?\" asked Blackwell.\n\nYachty responded, saying, \"Well, that year, yeah, that's a good year. It's just blurry because I be doing so much.\"\n\nBLACK LIVES MATTER GLOBAL CIRCLING THE DRAIN AS IT RUNS OUT OF CASH: REPORT\n\nRapper Lil Yachty called BLM a 'scam' while on a YouTube cooking show last week, citing the organization's purchase of a $6 million mansion in October 2020 with money that had been donated to BLMGNF (Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation). (Photo by Prince Williams/FilmMagic)\n\nThe host immediately followed up his response, asking, \"BLM? Since you want to be so Black power?\"\n\n\"BLM is a scam,\" Yachty responded, to the shock of the host.\n\n\"Clip that! Send it to the f------ news!\" Blackwell responded.\n\nYachty, who has 5.3 million followers on social media platform X, expanded on his statement, explaining to the host why he believes the social justice group is a \"scam.\"\n\n\"BLM was literally a scam. They had bought mansions , and you probably wouldn't know anything about it because you don't care about Black people, and don't follow Black news,\" Yachty jokingly asserted.\n\nBlackwell, who is African-American herself, told the rapper that she does \"care about Black people,\" and that she's \"literally the most pro-Black person in this room.\"\n\n'LOVE IS BLIND' STAR SARA CARTON REJECTS BEN MEZZENGA AT THE ALTAR OVER VIEWS ON RELIGION, BLACK LIVES MATTER\n\nBlack Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors came under fire in 2022 for using donations to purchase $6 million mansion. (Getty Images)\n\nBLM came under fire in 2022 after their lavish home purchase was exposed by New York Magazine. According to the report, \"The California property was purchased for nearly $6 million in cash in October 2020 with money that had been donated to BLMGNF (Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation).\"\n\nThe report caused the activist organization to respond on Twitter.\n\n\"There have been a lot of questions surrounding recent reports about the purchase of Creator's House in California,\" the Black Lives Matter official Twitter account posted.\n\n\"Despite past efforts, BLMGNF recognizes that there is more work to do to increase transparency and ensure transitions in leadership are clear,\" it added.\n\nIn subsequent tweets, BLM called a flurry of reports looking into the group's finances \"inflammatory and speculative\" and blamed them for \"causing harm.\" The reports \"do not reflect the totality of the movement,\" the organization claimed.\n\nAt the time, BLMGNF board member Shalomyah Bowers emailed a statement to the New York Magazine reporter claiming that the organization purchased the property \"with the intention for it to serve as housing and studio space for recipients of the Black Joy Creators Fellowship,\" a program that was reportedly announced the next day as providing \"recording resources and dedicated space for Black creatives to launch content online and in real life focused on abolition, healing justice, urban agriculture and food justice, pop culture, activism, and politics.\"\n\nBlack Lives Matter responded to Yachty's claims, slamming the rapper for 'drinking the white supremacist Kool-Aid.' ((Photo by Barry Brecheisen/Getty Images))\n\nBlack Lives Matter Global Network Foundation responded to Fox News Digital's request for comment on Yachty's claims with strong words for the rapper: \"It's clear Lil Yachty has been drinking the white supremacist ideology Kool-Aid. His comments are wrong. They are misinformed, unoriginal, and crafted to please the same people who profit from Black suffering.\"\n\nThe statement continued, \"The real scam isn't Black Lives Matter. It is watching Black artists with massive platforms recycle the same tired attacks on Black movements while ignoring the actual systems killing us. Black Lives Matter has supported Black families who have lost loved ones to police violence. We have built programs, funded mutual aid, and fought in courtrooms and on the streets to protect our people.\"\n\nFox News Digital's Kristine Parks and Ronn Blitzer contributed to this report.\n\nGet all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inbox.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and\n        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

So this is just them... being sore losers and sour grapes.\"\n\nAnti-DOGE protesters took to the streets on President's Day to demonstrate against the Trump administration's effort to cut wasteful government spending.\n\nThe 50501 Movement organized protests nationwide on Monday, calling out Elon Musk, his efforts through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and President Trump as they continue to cut down on government waste .\n\nDemonstrators took to the streets in cities like Austin, Birmingham, Tampa and Washington, D.C.\n\n\"Deport Musk!\" one protester shouted. \"Trump and Musk have got to go!\" others yelled.\n\n\"Democrats are desperate, I would say it is the closest thing to a national cult that we have,\" Fisher said. \"When you are overwhelmingly beat with a mandate and swept across all branches of government, you basically have nothing else, and that's the playbook, [it's] just protest Trump.\"\n\nTREASURY 'MISTAKENLY' GAVE MUSK DOGE WORKER ABILITY TO CHANGE PAYMENTS SYSTEM: COURT DOCS\n\n\"But I believe Americans are tired of protests now, and Democrats offered nothing but protests,\" he continued. \"They just need to... just lick their wounds and give Donald Trump and his administration the chance to do what the people voted him in to do.\"\n\nThe 50501 Movement released a statement about the protests, calling the movement a \"vision\" that pushes back against the \"modern-day civil rights struggle.\"\n\n\"The 50501 Movement does not refer to an organization - it represents a vision, the American dream, as we were all once taught, to believe it,\" the statement read. \"This is not just a movement - it is our modern-day civil rights struggle.\"\n\nJones asked Fisher what prompted the evolution of his political ideology. He explained that the Democrats use voters and then dispose of them when they are no longer useful to the party.\n\n\"I think that the Democrats are experts at taking advantage of the most vulnerable and weak-minded people in society,\" he said.\n\n\"I was there, and I did it... at one time. And then when they're done with you... You become disposable, and they're doing the same thing. They did it with Black people, and they did it with the immigrants, illegal immigrants.

Washingtonians celebrate the newest federal holiday that marks the day on June 19, 1865 when the Emancipation Proclamation was read aloud by Army General Gordon Granger in Galveston, Texas to formally notify previously enslaved people of their freedom. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\nBlack Lives Matter Plaza in Washington, D.C., will be getting removed and its ground mural is set to be painted over, according to a spokesperson for D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser.\n\nAccording to NBC News , the removal process currently has no timeline, but the ground mural will be replaced by a design that was created by D.C. schoolchildren, with Bowser saying the decision was made several days ago.\n\nAfter George Floyd was killed during the summer of 2020, which sparked protests across the country, two blocks of 16th Street NW which is situated just north of the White House, was designated as Black Lives Matter Plaza. The ground mural was unveiled June 5, 2020, and despite being paved over and replaced, Bowser had announced in October 2021, that the new mural would be a permanent installation.\n\nThe removal could signal a preemptive move on Bowser's part, after U.S. Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-Ga.) introduced legislation on Monday that would force the mayor to rename the Black Lives Matter Plaza or risk losing federal funding if passed.\n\nThe bill would require two-block stretch to be renamed Liberty Plaza, as well as update all government websites, and documents. The ground mural would further need to be covered up.\n\nIn a statement , Clyde said he was pleased with the quick outcome that came within a day of filing his bill.\n\n\"I'm very pleased that within one day of introducing my bill to rename BLM Plaza, Mayor Bowser announced plans to do just that,\" Clyde said. \"My focus remains on ensuring this woke, divisive slogan is removed and no longer stains the streets of America's capital city, and I will continue pursuing my effort until BLM Plaza is officially gone for good.\"\n\nDuring an interview with The Daily Caller in 2024, Clyde said the whole project was a waste of money.\n\n\"The fact that the city spent almost $5 million on it is an incredible waste of money. And then to maintain it, another waste of money,\" Clyde told The Daily Caller. \"So, honestly, the street needs to go back to the way it was, which is a public thoroughfare, and the Black Lives Matter wording needs to be paved over.\"\n\nBowser said in a statement Tuesday that the mural \"inspired\" people but the \"federal job cuts\" should now be the top concern.\n\n\"The mural inspired millions of people and helped our city through a very painful period, but now we can't afford to be distracted by meaningless congressional interference,\" Bowser said. \"The devastating impacts of the federal job cuts must be our number one concern. Our focus is on economic growth, public safety, and supporting our residents affected by these cuts.\"\n\nIJR, Contributor Writer\n\nJoin Over 6M Subscribers\n\nWe're organizing an online community to elevate trusted voices on all sides so that you can be fully informed.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR\n\nLogin to your account below\n\nRemember Me\n\nPlease enter your username or email address to reset your password.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR"

Micah Johnson, 25, had no criminal history, Dallas police said in a statement. (Photo by KENA BETANCUR / AFP) (Photo by KENA BETANCUR/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe California Department of Justice has threatened to hold Black Lives Matter leaders in the state personally liable if the organization does not produce financial reports within the next two months.\n\nAccording to the Washington Examiner , the charity has a bankroll of approximately $60 million. However, it failed to submit required yearly financial reports.\n\n\"The organization BLACK LIVES MATTER GLOBAL NETWORK FOUNDATION, INC. is delinquent with The Registry of Charitable Trusts for failing to submit required annual report(s),\" the Jan. 31 letter said.\n\nThe Examiner reported BLM has yet to submit its 2020 Form 990, which is required for charities that are exempt from income tax, and other financial documents.\n\nThe letter said BLM will be barred from \"soliciting or disbursing charitable funds\" until it produces the forms.\n\nIn addition, failure to produce the reports within 60 days would result in the California Registry of Charitable Trusts revoking BLM's tax-exempt status and imposing fines for \"each month or partial month for which the report(s) are delinquent,\" the letter said.\n\n\"Directors, trustees, officers and return preparers responsible for failure to timely file the above-described report(s) are personally liable for payment of all penalties, interest and other costs incurred to restore exempt status.\"\n\nCalifornia is the second historically left-leaning state to raise concerns with BLM this calendar year. In a separate article, the Examiner reported Washington state ordered BLM to \"immediately cease\" fundraising in a Jan. 5 letter.\n\nThe letter also told BLM it may face fines of up to $2,000 for each donation it solicited or received. As of Monday, the charity had ignored the order and continued accepting donations, the Examiner reported.\n\nPrior to these two rebukes, BLM was already out of compliance with charity registration requirements in Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, New Jersey, North Carolina and Virginia.\n\nBLM was described as being \"like a giant ghost ship full of treasure drifting in the night with no captain, no discernible crew, and no clear direction,\" by CharityWatch Executive Director Laurie Styron, according to the Examiner.\n\nLavern Spicer, a Florida Republican running for a seat in the United States House of Representatives, suggested BLM's murky finances were intentional to hide where the donations were going.\n\n\"Black lives DON'T matter to Black Lives Matter, that's why none of the $30 million they raised ever went to help any part of the black community,\" Spicer wrote in a tweet.\n\nBlack lives DON'T matter to Black Lives Matter, that's why none of the $30 million they raised ever went to help any part of the black community.\n\n- Lavern Spicer (@lavern_spicer) February 2, 2022\n\nBLM does not currently have an identified leader, the Examiner reported. Co-founder Patrisse Cullors resigned in May 2021 .\n\nCullors named two fellow activists to take over the executive director role, but they later revealed they denied the job after disagreements with the charity.\n\nCullors' resignation also resulted at least in part from the organization's questionable finances. According to an April 2021 report from the New York Post , Cullors bought four lavish homes during her time at the helm of BLM.\n\nThe properties she purchased included a $1.4 million house near Malibu, California, and a \"custom ranch\" on a 3.2 acre plot in Georgia - complete with an airplane hangar and swimming pool.\n\nHawk Newsome, the head of a separate group called Black Lives Matter Greater New York City, told the Post that Cullors' spending spree damaged the credibility of the BLM movement.\n\n\"If you go around calling yourself a socialist, you have to ask how much of her own personal money is going to charitable causes,\" he said. \"It's really sad because it makes people doubt the validity of the movement and overlook the fact that it's the people that carry this movement.\"\n\nThis article appeared originally on The Western Journal .\n\nJoin Over 6M Subscribers\n\nWe're organizing an online community to elevate trusted voices on all sides so that you can be fully informed.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR\n\nLogin to your account below\n\nRemember Me\n\nPlease enter your username or email address to reset your password.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR"

      "text": "BLM Leader Calls For 'Black Vigilantes' To Descend On Cities Following Daniel Penny Acquittal\n\nBlack Lives Matter (BLM) leader Hawk Newsome called for \"black vigilantes\" to descend into major cities Monday to retaliate against 26-year-old former Marine Daniel Penny's acquittal over the death of Jordan Neely.\n\nA Manhattan jury found Penny not guilty of criminally negligent homicide after he held 30-year-old homeless man Jordan Neely in a chokehold to protect surrounding passengers on a New York City subway train in May 2023. Newsome called on \"black vigilantes\" to avenge Neely's death and fight against white people who allegedly want to \"choke\" and \"kill\" black people for \"being loud.\"\n\n\"Like everybody else has vigilantes, we need some black vigilantes,\" Newsome said. \"People want to jump up and choke us and kill us for being loud, how about we do the same when they attempt to oppress us? I'm tired. I know you're looking for us to be like 'oh, go and march. Go and march.' No, this weekend, I want you to hold a community event, everywhere from the Bronx, to Houston, to Seattle, to Florida. Black people hold community events and talk about what you need.\"\n\nPassengers who witnessed the incident said Neely behaved in an erratic and threatening manner by screaming at commuters, throwing his jacket on the ground and saying that he did not care if he went to jail. Penny then came up from behind Neely and held him in the chokehold for about 15 minutes, where Neely eventually lost consciousness and was pronounced dead.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg charged Penny after a medical examiner ruled Neely's death a homicide in May 2023. The manslaughter charge , which was dismissed prior to the jury's verdict, came with a potential 15-year prison sentence, while the negligent homicide charge comes with a maximum four-year sentence.\n\nFormer federal prosecutor Andy McCarthy said during a Monday Fox News segment that the jury was in a \"deadlock\" likely due to many jurors buying into Bragg's alleged \"racialized\" narrative of the incident.\n\nProtesters supporting Neely gathered outside the courtroom prior to and following the verdict, chanting \"no justice, no peace\" and warning that the public \"will hear [them] tonight.\"\n\nBLM executives have publicly identified themselves as \"trained Marxist[s],\" including co-founder Patrisse Cullors, who confirmed in 2020 that she and her fellow organizers are Marxist ideologues focused on building a movement \"that could be utilized by many, many black folk.\" Activists sued BLM in September 2022 over allegations that its leader, Shalomyah Bowers, siphoned more than $10 million from the organization for her \"personal piggy bank.\"\n\nIn 2020, Cullors further used donations raked in by BLM following the death of George Floyd to purchase a $6 million home for personal use, a flight on a private jet and to fund a $4 million operating budget for two employees, according to National Review.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "Marco Rubio Offers to Help Black Lives Matter Leaders 'Emigrate to Cuba'\n\n(Andrew Harnik/Reuters)\n\nRepublican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio said Thursday that his office is willing to help Black Lives Matter leaders move to Cuba after the organization issued a statement in support of the country's communist regime and against the United States.\n\n\"My office stands ready to help the leaders of the Black Lives Matter organization emigrate to Cuba,\" Rubio wrote in a Thursday post on Twitter.\n\nMy office stands ready to help the leaders of the Black Lives Matter organization emigrate to #Cuba\n\n- Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) July 15, 2021\n\nThe self-described \"[m]ovement to fight for Freedom, Liberation and Justice,\" Black Lives Matter, whose top brass is riddled with allegations of corruption, condemned the U.S. in a Thursday post on Instagram , blaming the federal government for the \"inhumane treatment of Cubans.\"\n\nDuring the week of the Cuban freedom movement demonstrations that began Sunday, however, it was the communist government of Cuba that clamped down on journalists, the internet and activists - not the U.S. government.\n\nBLM, which was founded by self-described \"trained Marxists,\" went on to demand that the U.S. end its embargo against the communist government of the country, alleging that \"[s]ince 1962, the United States has forced pain and suffering on the people of Cuba by cutting off food, medicine and supplies, costing the tiny island nation an estimated $130 billion.\n\n\"The people of Cuba are being punished by the U.S. government because the country has maintained its commitment to sovereignty and self-determination.\"\n\nBlack Lives Matter has released a statement on Cuba: pic.twitter.com/NgnT1o1oZE\n\n- Sabrina Rodríguez (@sabrod123) July 15, 2021\n\nAccording to the State Department , the U.S. has a \"comprehensive economic embargo\" against Cuba. Then-President John F. Kennedy declared a trade embargo against the country, responding to actions taken by the communist-dominated Cuban government, in February 1962. Kennedy had directed the Departments of Commerce and the Treasury to enforce the embargo, which stands to this day.\n\nThe slogans the Cuban people chanted during the Sunday demonstrations, however, were not directed against the American government and in support of the communists clutching onto power in Havana.\n\nRather they were shouts of \"Liberty,\" \"We are not afraid!\" and \"Homeland and Life,\" calling for an end to over 60 years of communist repression on the island nation that left Cuban people deprived of the prosperity and freedoms citizens of freer nations enjoy.\n\nSome of the demonstrators waved the American flag - a utilization of the national flag of the U.S. as a symbol of liberty seen in other parts of the world such as Hong Kong where people fought for freedom.\n\n\"Cuba has historically demonstrated solidarity with oppressed peoples of African descent, from protecting Black revolutionaries like Assata Shakur through granting her asylum, to supporting Black liberation struggles in Angola, Mozambique, Guinea Bissau and South Africa,\" BLM went on to say.\n\nAssata Shakur , or Joanne Chesimard, is an anti-American, Federal Bureau of Investigation most wanted terrorist responsible for slaughtering and injuring over a dozen law enforcement officers before reportedly fleeing to Cuba, where she was allegedly sheltered by the Castro regime.\n\nBLM closed its statement noting that the organization \"look[s] to President [Joe] Biden to end the embargo, something Barack Obama called for in 2016. This embargo is a blatant human rights violation and it must come to an end.\"\n\nThe extortionist ring known as the Black Lives Matter organization took a break today from shaking down corporations for millions & buying themselves mansions to share their support for the Communist regime in #Cuba https://t.co/xir94EIJ4X\n\n- Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) July 15, 2021\n\n\"The extortionist ring known as the Black Lives Matter organization took a break today from shaking down corporations for millions & buying themselves mansions to share their support for the Communist regime in Cuba,\" Rubio, a descendant of Cuban refugees himself, wrote in a Twitter post responding to BLM's statement.\n\nOthers pointed out the dual standard on police brutality BLM demonstrated in its silence on Cuban police crackdowns against the demonstrators.\n\nWell but this is GOOD police violence\n\n- alessio (@lxssio) July 15, 2021\n\n\"So wait, they support police brutality now?\" radio show host Dan O'Donnell asked, to which one Twitter user responded saying, \"Well but this is GOOD police violence.\"\n\nBLM is not the only left-leaning organization calling for an end to the embargo against Cuba.\n\nThe Democratic Progressive Caucus of Florida released a statement Thursday calling on Biden to enact a \"complete and immediate repeal of the United States embargo against Cuba,\" saying that the embargo \"is inarguably one of the greatest failures of American foreign policy in modern history.\"\n\n\"As an American of Cuban descent myself, I plead for President Biden to act quickly. I'm fortunate enough to not have family on the island and can only imagine the anxiety and panic felt by Cuban-Americans who are not able to see or help their loved ones,\" DPCF President Michael Calderin said.\n\n\"Had the Trump Administration continued to improve relations with Cuba instead of rolling back the Obama-era improvements, everyday Cubans on the island and Cuban-Americans would be able to comfort each other. The situation has escalated now where only a full repeal of the embargo will alleviate the suffering from the pandemic.\"\n\nThe group claimed that the Cuban people took to the streets because \"the conditions pushing them past their breaking points are in no small part exacerbated by the United States' embargo against Cuba.\"\n\nThis article appeared originally on The Western Journal .\n\nJoin Over 6M Subscribers\n\nWe're organizing an online community to elevate trusted voices on all sides so that you can be fully informed.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR\n\nLogin to your account below\n\nRemember Me\n\nPlease enter your username or email address to reset your password.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR"

(@Julio_Rosas11 / X screen shot)\n\nThe Black Lives Matter organization has been using racial division for personal gain for over 10 years now, and it's still at it.\n\nTax filings of the \"nonprofit\" from 2020 to 2022 revealed that only around a third of the $90 million in donations received following the 2020 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody went to other charitable organizations, according to the New York Post .\n\nAmong the expenditures raising scrutiny were $1.6 million paid to the father of co-founder Patrisse Cullors for security services and $2.1 million to a consulting firm run by BLM board member Shalomyah Bowers. Cullors' brother Paul's companies were paid over $1.5 million total between 2020 and 2021.\n\nBut while the founders rake in money hand over fist, the cause continues to spread its cancer of racial division based on lies and misinformation, resulting in incidences like the one at the University of Memphis on Wednesday.\n\nAround 200 protesters gathered outside the UC Theatre at the University of Memphis to voice their opposition to an appearance by Kyle Rittenhouse .\n\nYou may remember Rittenhouse as the then-17-year-old young man who was acquitted of murder after fatally shooting two people and injuring a third person in self-defense after being attacked from behind during the Kenosha, Wisconsin, riots in August 2020, according to Fox News .\n\nThe protesters on Wednesday held signs with messages such as \"Put Rittenhouse behind bars not a podium,\" \"Murderers don't belong here,\" and \"No one should be open to: Racism, Christo-Fascism, Murderous Little S***s,\" according to the Memphis Commercial Appeal .\n\nMany chanted slogans such as \"No justice , no peace\" as they congregated near the entrance to the theater, which was blocked off by police vehicles and fencing.\n\nThe event hosted by the campus conservative group Turning Point USA was titled \"The Lies of Black Lives Matter and the Second Amendment.\"\n\nWhile the university said it had to allow the event under free speech laws, it encouraged protesters to remain peaceful and respectful. Campus police said they had a \"comprehensive plan\" for security, the Commercial Appeal reported.\n\nA WHBQ-TV reporter who was on the scene said that according to witness reports, Rittenhouse had the venue booked from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. but his security team \"abruptly removed him from the venue\" just before 8 p.m.\n\nFrontlines, a journalistic branch of Turning Point USA, posted Wednesday on X, \"BLM protesters at the University of Memphis surged towards the entrance to the Kyle Rittenhouse event chanting 'Kyle is a killer!'\"\n\nBLM protesters at the University of Memphis surged towards the entrance to the Kyle Rittenhouse event chanting \"Kyle is a killer!\" @TPUSA | @Julio_Rosas11 pic.twitter.com/TMWhKXIpDg\n\n- FRONTLINES (@FrontlinesTPUSA) March 21, 2024\n\nAt 9:15 p.m., journalist Julio Rosas posted a video of students chasing down Turning Point USA organizers.\n\n\"Chaos breaks out at the University of Memphis after BLM protesters chased down @TPUSA people who were leaving the Kyle Rittenhouse event,\" he wrote. \"Police had to prevent the hostile crowd from physically attacking them.\"\n\n🚨: Chaos breaks out at the University of Memphis after BLM protesters chased down @TPUSA people who were leaving the Kyle Rittenhouse event.

(Andrew Kelly/Reuters)\n\nAs the saying goes, a stopped clock is right twice a day.\n\nAnd in this case, Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-N.Y.) is the stopped clock.\n\nYou may recall that name from the beginning of the month when the Democratic congressman pulled a fire alarm in a Capitol office building - then claimed he thought it would open a door.\n\nBut on Tuesday, he was exactly right when he called out the Chicago chapter of Black Lives Matter (BLM) for a since-deleted tweet.\n\nThe account tweeted a graphic with the words, \"That is all that is it!\" and \"I STAND WITH PALESTINE.\"\n\nIt included a depiction of someone with what appeared to be a paragliding sail and a Palestinian flag.\n\nBLM Chicago just deleted this tweet but not before 10,000 people liked it. And not one of them was a Republican. pic.twitter.com/l0hjYLhKbJ - PhotographicFloridian (@JackLinFLL) October 11, 2023\n\nBLM Chicago just deleted this tweet but not before 10,000 people liked it. And not one of them was a Republican. pic.twitter.com/l0hjYLhKbJ\n\nThe tweet was utterly abhorrent in its imagery after Hamas terrorists paraglided into a music festival in Israel and killed hundreds of civilians.\n\nIt is not really clear what other message they thought they were sending than supporting a massacre.\n\nThe post was so atrocious that Bowman couldn't ignore it, writing on X, \"Disgusting. This promotes an act in which innocent civilians were killed. Babies. We need to stand for human life and collective humanity.\"\n\n\"This does the opposite,\" he added.\n\nDisgusting.

This does the opposite. https://t.co/l5IrfD4QBc\n\nThe BLM group has since deleted the post and replaced it with a message that states, \"Yesterday we sent out msgs that we aren't proud of. We stand with Palestine [and] the people who will do what they must to live free.\"\n\n\"Our hearts are with, the grieving mothers, those rescuing babies from rubble, who are in danger of being wiped out completely,\" it added.\n\nThat post is not much better as it's not clear how murdering hundreds of civilians and then running back to the Gaza Strip does anything to advance Palestinians' ability to live freely.\n\nBut at least there are some progressive Democrats who are able to condemn such messages.\n\nIJR, Senior Writer\r\nHe's written for Independent Journal Review since 2019.\n\nJoin Over 6M Subscribers\n\nWe're organizing an online community to elevate trusted voices on all sides so that you can be fully informed.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR\n\nLogin to your account below\n\nRemember Me\n\nPlease enter your username or email address to reset your password.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR"

Tim Walz's wife, Gwen, said she left her windows open to \"smell the burning tires\" during the 2020 Black Lives Matter riots because she felt it was a \"touchstone\" moment.\n\nAn interview clip with Gwen Walz discussing the 2020 riots and her reaction to them resurfaced online Tuesday after Vice President Kamala Harris announced she would be choosing the Minnesota governor as her running mate for the 2024 election. In the interview, which was aired on KSTP-TV's \"5 Eyewitness News Nightcast\" channel, Gwen could be heard talking about the riots and her choice to leave the \"windows open as long\" as the city was burned by looters and rioters.\n\n\"I could smell the burning tires. That was a very real thing, and I kept the windows open as long as I could because I felt like that was such a touchstone of what was happening,\" Gwen Walz said.\n\nHere is a bizarre clip from an interview with Gwen Walz stating that she left her windows open during the Minneapolis Riots so she could smell the burning tires.\n\nHer daughter also coordinated with rioters to let them know that the National Guard would not be activated one night. pic.twitter.com/ityW100Z4y\n\n- Dustin Grage (@GrageDustin) August 6, 2024\n\nMinneapolis was quickly swarmed by rioters after the death of George Floyd in 2020, leading to many buildings being burned down and businesses looted, with the violence lasting for three days.\n\nFollowing the reveal of Walz as Harris' running mate, Republican lawmakers and others online quickly pointed out how Walz failed to immediately send the National Guard into Minneapolis to address the violence occurring at the time. Walz had previously argued that calling the National Guard would only incite further rioting, as he had suggested protesters needed space to express their outrage, according to Fox News.\n\n\"I want to just be clear there's philosophically an argument to be made that an armed presence on the ground in the midst of where we just had a police killing is seen as a catalyst,\" Walz said at the time.\n\nWalz's office and the Harris campaign did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation's request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

BLM Mural Set To Be Removed As Democrat Mayor Bowser Gives Into GOP Pressure\n\nOAN Staff Blake Wolf 1:53 PM - Wednesday, March 5, 2025\n\nThe \"Black Lives Matter\" ground mural in Washington, D.C., which has exhibited on a street in the Nation's Capital for over four years, is slated to be painted over sometime in the future, accompanied by a name change for \"Black Lives Matter Plaza.\"\n\nA spokesperson for D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser confirmed that the change will be happening, although it is unclear as to when the removal is expected to take place on the two-block-long pedestrian section of 16th Street NW in downtown Washington, D.C.\n\nThe ground mural was painted in 2020 following the death of George Floyd - a part-time security guard whose death inspired a series of national protests against police brutality toward Black people. Floyd's last words before he died with fentanyl and methamphetamine in his system, while officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on his neck, were \"I can't breathe\" - which became a rallying slogan for the BLM movement.\n\nThe move to paint over the BLM street mural and change the plaza name follows after Representative Andrew Clyde (R-Ga.) introduced a bill to \"withhold certain apportionment funds from the District of Columbia unless the Mayor of the District of Columbia removes the phrase Black Lives Matter from the street symbolically designated as Black Lives Matter Plaza.\"\n\nThe bill also called for the street to be renamed from \"Black Lives Matter Plaza\" to \"Liberty Plaza.\"\n\nClyde celebrated the announcement of the name change, writing in an X post: \"This woke, divisive slogan will no longer stain the streets of America's capital city.\"\n\nBREAKING: Following the introduction of my bill to rename Black Lives Matter Plaza, Mayor Bowser CAVED-announcing that D.C. WILL rename the plaza. This woke, divisive slogan will no longer stain the streets of America's capital city. pic.twitter.com/iQyjDvqp6Z\n\nD.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser seemingly caved into the pressure from the Republican-controlled Congress, announcing that the initiate to change the plaza name and BLM mural will be a part of a new project called \"America 250 mural project\" - where students and artists are invited to \"create new murals across all eight wards.\"\n\n\"The mural inspired millions of people and helped our city through a very painful period, but now we can't afford to be distracted by meaningless congressional interference,\" Bowser wrote in a Wednesday statement.\n\nBowser's statement also blasted President Donald Trump's work with the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), which is focused on cutting waste, fraud, and overspending in the federal government.\n\n\"The devastating impacts of the federal job cuts must be our number one concern. Our focus is on economic growth, public safety, and supporting our residents affected by these cuts,\" she added.\n\nMeanwhile, Nee Nee Taylor, a founding member of a Black Lives Matter affiliate in D.C., responded to Bowser's announcement, angrily declaring: \"You never cared about Black Lives Mattering. You painting those words were performative.\"\n\n@MayorBowser you never cared about Black Lives Mattering. You painting those words were performative, you were in a pissing match with Trump. The city removed the names of the people that were killed by the @DCPoliceDept 😔. You allowed them to beat and teargas us on that Plaza.\n\nStay informed!

      "text": "'Grammy Award-Winning' Rapper Lil Yachty Calls The Black Lives Matter Movement A 'Scam'\n\nOAN Staff Blake Wolf 12:00 PM - Wednesday, March 12, 2025\n\nGrammy award-winning rapper Lil Yachty recently characterized Black Lives Matter (BLM) as a \"scam,\" during an appearance on Quenlin Blackwell's YouTube show.\n\nQuenlin Blackwell describes herself as a social media star, comedian, model, and influencer.\n\nLil Yachty, whose real name is Miles Parks McCollum, appeared on Blackwell's \"Feeding Starving Celebrities\" cooking show - where she questioned McCollum's spending habits.\n\n\"You spent $100,000 on a trip to Disney World. How much have you spent on charitable causes?\" Blackwell asked. \"BLM? Because you want to be so black powered?\"\n\nMcCollum quickly responded, expressing that \"BLM is a scam.\"\n\n\"BLM was literally a scam. They had bought mansions,\" he explained to the host, referencing how the leaders of the BLM movement had taken charitable funds and used the money to buy a mansion for themselves.\n\nHowever, McCollum's comment seemingly caught Blackwell off guard, telling her viewers to: \"clip that, send it to the f***ing news.\"\n\nMcCollum went on to jokingly argue that she \"probably wouldn't know anything about it, because [Blackwell] don't care about Black people. You don't follow Black news.\"\n\nThe rapper highlighted how Blackwell has an \"all White staff,\" with one of her staffers responding off camera, asserting that he's a \"POC,\" which means person of color, and \"gay\" - prompting McCollum to humorously respond \"I too have a gay.\"\n\nLil Yachty says BLM was a scam on Quen Blackwell's \"Feeding Starving Celebrities.\" pic.twitter.com/le4iwgJnJG\n\nMcCollum's criticism stems from leaders of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement utilizing $6 million donated to the group to purchase a 6,500-square foot Southern California mansion - rather than spending the funds in ways to uplift or benefit the Black community as whole.\n\nAdditionally, a former BLM leader within the Greater Atlanta chapter was sentenced to 42 months in federal prison on charges of money laundering and wire fraud. Sir Maejor Page, 36, a Black American with albinism, was sentenced to prison and also ordered to pay a $400 \"special assessment fee\" after being convicted.\n\nPage, who is also known as Tyree Conyers-Page, used the $450,000 in BLM donations to purchase \"tailored suits, nightclub bar tabs, a night with a sex worker, and an Ohio mansion.\"\n\nAs the BLM organization has been seemingly fraught with fraudulent spending, the group revealed that it was at risk of going bankrupt in May 2023, due to falling into an $8.5 million deficit in the 2022 fiscal year - while retaining multiple officials holding seven-figure salaries.\n\nStay informed!

Spends Over $270,000 To Re-Paint BLM Plaza As Crime Rises\n\nOAN's Abril Elfi 12:53 PM - Wednesday, November 29, 2023\n\nWashington, D.C., is paying $270,000 to touch up the paint job on the \"Black Lives Matter Plaza\" amid rising crime rates.\n\nThe district has implemented millions in budget cuts to the Metropolitan Police Department over the past several years and crime has spiked 40% since last year.\n\nZack Smith, a crime and justice expert at the Heritage Foundation, told the press that it is \"insulting\" how the mayor's office wants to take crime rates seriously but still conducts budget cuts to public safety.\n\n\"It's insulting on multiple fronts,\" Smith said. \"If the city council and the mayor's office are serious about combating violent crime, protecting the lives hopefully of all citizens, but particularly black lives, then they would pour more money into public safety - particularly putting more police officers on the street.\"\n\n\"Instead, it seems like the city is prioritizing performative gestures that really don't have an impact on combating violent crime,\" he said, adding it sends the \"message that violent crime will be tolerated in the city.\"\n\nAccording to data released on Monday, the 34% increase in homicides in D.C. over the previous year accounts for a significant portion of the 40% increase in violent crime. In the same period, there was a 68% increase in robberies.\n\nCarjackings have increased 93% since last year, and thousands more have happened in addition to violent crime.\n\nThe District of Columbia Council approved a $526.1 million police budget for 2023, which despite being 1.7% lower than the previous year is almost $100 million less than the budget for 2020.\n\nThe fiscal 2023 proposal slashed millions from the Narcotics and Special Investigations and Criminal Investigations Division, though it is unclear what departments received the budget cuts.\n\nThe street art was first commissioned in 2020 by Mayor Muriel Bowser (D-D.C.), who pledged in 2021 to \"transform\" the Black Lives Matter Plaza for $4.8 million, with an additional $3 million to come. Judicial Watch recently requested access to public records, and the results show that $271,231 was spent on supplies and labor to repaint the letters.\n\nStay informed!

According to Penny and other witnesses, Neely had been threatening to \"kill a motherf-er\" and stated that he didn't care if he was sent back to jail, asserting that \"someone\" was going to \"die today.\"\n\nNeely was previously arrested 44 times for assaulting women, one of them being 67-years-old, theft, evading fares, and even an alleged kidnapping of a 7-year-old girl in 2015.\n\nNewsome, who strangely claimed to be Neely's uncle, reportedly threatened Penny himself in the courtroom, declaring \"it's a small f**king world, buddy.\"\n\nThe BLM leader then spoke to reporters following Penny's acquittal, calling for \"Black vigilante justice.\"\n\n\"Everybody else has vigilantes. We need some black vigilantes,\" he stated. \"People want to jump up and choke us and kill us for being loud, how about we do the same when they attempt to oppress us.\"\n\nNew York BLM Leader, Hawk Newsome, calls for \"Black vigilantes\" after Daniel Penny's acquittal. #NYC #BLM #HawkNewsome #Breaking #Latest #News #OAN pic.twitter.com/06aa4EQZTO\n\n\"America will never fix the issue of black people because America needs a punching bag. They have designated us as the punching bag,\" he added. \"So f**k America. How dare you laugh and cheer when someone gets away with murdering us. I don't want a march. I want a step.\"\n\nDespite Newsome's condemnation, Dr. Satish Chundru, who testified during the trial, expressed that he did not believe Penny's chokehold was solely responsible for Neely's death.\n\n\"In your opinion, did Mr. Penny choke Mr. Neely to death?\" asked defense attorney Steven Raiser.\n\n\"No,\" Chundru stated in response, \"The chokehold did not cause death.\"\n\nChundru added that Neely's death was attributed to \"the combined effects of sickle cell crisis, the schizophrenia, the struggle and restraint, and the synthetic marijuana,\" according to Fox News , adding that the medical records were not consistent with a fatal chokehold.\n\nStay informed!

In October 2021, Bowser \"cemented\" it \"into permanence.\"\n\n\"When we created Black Lives Matter Plaza in June 2020, we sent a strong message that Black Lives Matter, and that power has always been and always will be with well-meaning people,\" she said in a statement . \"Today, we have transformed the mural into a monument.\"\n\nThe announcement noted that the project cost $4.8 million and that other additions, such as reconstructed sidewalks and benches, would come from a $3 million investment.

      "text": "Black Lives Matter Bleeds Cash As Disgraced Cofounder's Family Rakes In Big Bucks\n\nBlack Lives Matter cofounder Patrisse Cullors resigned from the embattled charity in 2021, but the charity suffered from the excesses of her tenure well into 2023, according to a copy of its latest tax return obtained by the Washington Free Beacon .\n\nUnder Cullors's leadership, Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation doled out massive contracts to her friends and family, purchased a $6 million mansion in Los Angeles in 2020, and financed the purchase of an $8 million mansion in Canada in 2021. By the end of its 2023 fiscal year, the tax forms show , Black Lives Matter saw the $80 million windfall it raked in during the George Floyd riots of 2020 diminish to under $29 million as it hemorrhaged cash fulfilling lingering contractual obligations to Cullors's associates.\n\nThose individuals include Damon Turner, the father of Cullors's only child, whose art firm Trap Heals received $778,000 from Black Lives Matter in 2023 despite performing no work for the charity that year.\n\nA Black Lives Matter source told the Free Beacon that the payments to Turner's firm in 2023 were for work it performed hosting a concert series in early 2022. Black Lives Matter said in a statement Turner no longer works with the charity.\n\nOther staffers from the Cullors era received massive payouts on their way out of Black Lives Matter. Former Black Lives Matter director of operations Raymond Howard and a consulting firm run by his sister, Danielle Howard, received a combined $1.1 million in payments in the group's 2023 fiscal year.\n\nThe group also disclosed two separate six-figure settlement agreements to unnamed former employees in its 2023 financial statements . A former Black Lives Matter board member received $400,000 as part of one settlement agreement, and an unnamed former employee received $335,000 in another settlement. Black Lives Matter told the Free Beacon it would not comment on \"confidential HR and legal matters.\"\n\nThough Black Lives Matter's latest financial disclosure paints a dire picture for the organization-it ran a $6 million deficit in 2023 after losing $8.5 million the year prior-the group said in a statement that 2023 was the start of a \"new era\" for the group. Black Lives Matter seeks to move past the controversies that arose during Cullors's tenure as executive director and have bogged the group down since 2020.\n\n\"We are committed to ensuring BLM's future and its ability to fuel the work we do for Black people around the globe by managing our annual expenditures,\" Black Lives Matter said in a statement. \"Year over year, we have decreased expenses from our first filing through this filing-71% over a three-year period of time. We have sought to make the organization sustainable and remain a core pillar that funds the Black liberation movement for the long haul.\"\n\nBut some holdovers from the Cullors era remain at Black Lives Matter. Her brother, Paul Cullors, received $200,000 in 2023 as Black Lives Matter's head of security, and his company, Black Ties LLC, earned an additional $1.6 million providing professional security services for the charity. Since 2021, Paul Cullors and his companies have hauled in over $4.2 million protecting Black Lives Matter as it has called for a \"national defunding of police.\"\n\nA Black Lives Matter source said Paul Cullors and his company provide online and in-person security services for upwards of 80 Black Lives Matter activists, including Cullors and the movement's other two cofounders, none of whom currently work for the charity. The source added that the group chose to work with Paul Cullors because his security firm is one of the few on the West Coast with no prior law enforcement background.\n\nAnother Cullors associate, Shalomyah Bowers, continues to serve on the Black Lives Matter board. Black Lives Matter paid his consulting firm $2.6 million for staffing and management services in its 2023 fiscal year.\n\nIt's not all doom and gloom for Black Lives Matter's finances. The group stands to receive a massive boost to its bottom line pending the results of a lawsuit it filed in May against the Tides Foundation, a left-wing dark money giant. The lawsuit alleges Tides refuses to hand back the more than $33 million it raised on behalf of Black Lives Matter in 2020. Tides contends it has ultimate control over the funds and has no obligation to return them to the charity.\n\nBut the group also has to contend with Black Lives Matter Grassroots, an offshoot organization led by longtime activist Melina Abdullah that now claims to be the true leader of the Black Lives Matter movement. Black Lives Matter Grassroots has its own financial challenges-there's no evidence the group has ever filed a tax return and the $8.7 million it received from Tides from 2020 through 2022 is completely unaccounted for, the Free Beacon reported .\n\nPublished under: Black Lives Matter , Dark Money , FEC , Tides Foundation\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "California Threatens To Bring Legal Hammer Down on Black Lives Matter Grassroots Over Sketchy Finances\n\nThe Black Lives Matter movement is once again facing legal scrutiny, with California attorney general Rob Bonta threatening to bring the hammer down on Black Lives Matter Grassroots if it doesn't soon disclose what it did with millions of dollars in unreported charitable donations in 2022.\n\nBonta, a Democrat, notified Black Lives Matter Grassroots in late August that he would have no choice but to strip the group of its charity status, levy massive taxes upon the organization, and fine its leader, activist and professor Melina Abdullah, if it doesn't file a copy of its 2022 Form 990 tax return with his office by Oct. 27.\n\nBut producing that tax form will likely be easier said than done for Black Lives Matter Grassroots. The group has had the privilege of operating as a tax-exempt charity since May 2022 but falsely claimed 2023 was its first year in business in its IRS tax return for that year. Several experts told the Washington Free Beacon it should have filed its 2022 tax return by last November at the latest. But it's nowhere to be found. The group's 2023 tax return, meanwhile, is laden with errors.\n\nThe missing 2022 tax return that Bonta now seeks could help resolve an $8.7 million mystery first reported by the Free Beacon in May. From 2020 through 2022, the Tides Foundation transferred $8.7 million in charitable funds for the benefit of Black Lives Matter Grassroots, but those donations seemingly disappeared on paper as movement insiders alleged Abdullah pilfered the organization's finances to pay for personal expenses, including a vacation to Jamaica. Abdullah denied the allegations in a 2022 interview .\n\nBlack Lives Matter Grassroots is an offshoot of Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, the charity commonly referred to as the national Black Lives Matter group, which raised $80 million during the George Floyd riots in 2020. Under the leadership of its former director Patrisse Cullors, the Global Network Foundation used its windfall to purchase a $6 million Los Angeles mansion in 2020 and an $8 million Canadian mansion in 2021 and doled out massive contracts to Cullors's friends and family.\n\nBlack Lives Matter Grassroots broke away from the Global Network Foundation in 2022 as the latter faced investigations and legal threats from authorities in California , Washington , and Indiana over the mismanagement of its windfall from the George Floyd riots. Black Lives Matter Grassroots claimed its progenitor was run by \"thieves\" and that it was the rightful leader of the activist movement and what remained of its war chest. It tried to sue the Global Network Foundation for $10 million in 2022, but a California judge threw out the lawsuit and ordered Black Lives Matter Grassroots to repay its progenitor's legal fees of over $700,000.\n\nAmid its rhetoric about the \"thieves\" running the Global Network Foundation, Black Lives Matter Grassroots has ensured its finances remain shrouded in secrecy. Abdullah told Black Lives Matter activists privately that she wanted to keep her group's financial arrangements \"intentionally private\" because she \"didn't want folks to know how the money was moving,\" the Free Beacon reported .\n\nIndeed, Black Lives Matter Grassroots's 2023 tax return is riddled with errors and discrepancies. It falsely said 2023 was its first year in business as a stand-alone charity, but the organization also reported it entered the year with $3.95 million in the bank. Both can't be true at the same time.\n\n\"In my 20 years of watchdog work, this is one of the sloppier tax filings I have seen,\" CharityWatch executive director Laurie Styron told the Free Beacon of Black Lives Matter Grassroots's 2023 tax filing. \"There aren't one or two mistakes here. This document is unusable for its intended purpose of providing the public with a means of holding the charity accountable. It's unethical.\"\n\nThe source of Black Lives Matter Grassroots's $3.95 million cash hoard at the start of 2023 is unclear. The money possibly originated from the Tides Foundation funding, but it represents less than half of the $8.7 million the Democratic dark money giant claimed to have provided to Black Lives Matter Grassroots before 2023. Whatever happened to the remaining millions presumably would have been disclosed in the charity's missing 2022 tax return.\n\nBonta also barred Black Lives Matter Grassroots from soliciting charitable contributions in California until it produces its missing 2022 tax return. But it doesn't appear the charity has taken notice of his warning-Black Lives Matter Grassroots continues to solicit online donations nationwide through the Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue as of last Wednesday.\n\nIt's unclear if Black Lives Matter Grassroots will comply with Bonta's demands before his Oct. 27 deadline. And though California is among the most liberal states in the country and is politically aligned with the Black Lives Matter movement, it's also one of the few states that doesn't turn a blind eye to charity malfeasance, former IRS tax law specialist Patrick Sternal told the Free Beacon .\n\n\"California is one of the handful of states that has a very aggressive charitable enforcement arm in its Attorney General's office,\" Sternal said. \"I imagine Black Lives Matter Grassroots will have to reckon with them.\"\n\nBlack Lives Matter Grassroots did not return a request for comment.\n\nSeveral charity experts said Black Lives Matter Grassroots's 2023 tax filing is laden with other errors and discrepancies. It reported in one section of the return that it has five members on its board of directors but only disclosed the names of two of those members in another section instructing disclosure of the names of all of its board members. Abdullah, who signed the tax filing under penalty of perjury, reported she didn't allow her fellow board members to review the document before she submitted it to the IRS.\n\n\"The multiple reporting errors and omissions in their initial 2023 IRS 990 report, particularly the lack of accounting for the source of approximately four million dollars, raises serious IRS violations subject to civil and even criminal charges against its president and its unnamed Board of Directors,\" said Paul Kamenar, counsel to the National Legal and Policy Center, an ethics watchdog group.\n\nStyron, the CharityWatch executive director, noted that oversight of Black Lives Matter Grassroots is practically nonexistent. It has no document retention policy. It has no conflict of interest policy. It won't provide its founding documents to the public despite IRS regulations requiring it to do so. Its financial statements haven't been reviewed or audited by an independent accountant. It claimed to grant $22,200 to individuals in 2023, but it didn't disclose any additional required information about the grants, and it says it doesn't maintain any records to substantiate the grants.\n\n\"A charity of this size should be expected to have a sufficiently large and independent board, and all the basic governance policies in place related to good record keeping, internal controls, conflicts of interest, and whistleblowers,\" Styron said. \"Right now, it's a puzzle with most of the pieces missing and no clear picture emerging about what's happening with millions of dollars of public money. This charity constructively has no oversight.\"\n\nSternal, the former IRS tax law specialist, said federal tax authorities shouldn't turn a blind eye to Black Lives Matter Grassroots's shoddy reporting.\n\n\"This raises a lot of flags, and there are a lot of indications that they are not operating consistently with the requirements of a 501(c)3 charitable organization,\" Sternal said. \"It's generally bad, bad reporting. There are inconsistencies and obvious gaps in the reporting here. It definitely raises questions, and I think it certainly should raise a flag at the IRS.\"\n\nPublished under: Black Lives Matter , California , Corruption , George Floyd , Taxes\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "Black Lives Matter Hemorrhaged Cash in 2022, Tax Documents Show\n\nBlack Lives Matter bled cash and suffered blistering investment losses in 2022, according to a copy of its tax return obtained by the Washington Free Beacon.\n\nBlack Lives Matter Global Network Foundation ran an $8.5 million deficit and saw the value of its investment accounts plummet by nearly $10 million in the most recent tax year, financial disclosures show. The group logged a $961,000 loss on a securities sale of $172,000, suggesting the charity weathered a staggering 85 percent loss on the transaction. These troubles didn't stop BLM from doling out seven-figure contracts to friends and family of its former executive director Patrisse Cullors, who once said charity financial disclosures were \"triggering\" and \"deeply unsafe.\"\n\nIt's no surprise that Cullors was so fearful of disclosing Black Lives Matter's finances to the public. The revelations in Black Lives Matter's latest Form 990 show that the group is on the fast track to financial insolvency, and that the excesses of Cullors's tenure have not abated under her chosen successor, Shalomyah Bowers.\n\nThe financial losses come after a year of missteps and setbacks for the embattled charity. BLM raised just $9.3 million in its 2022 fiscal year, down 88 percent from its haul the year prior. Black Lives Matter was forced to shut off its online fundraising streams in February 2022 due to compliance and transparency issues in several liberal states. The group has blown through two-thirds of the $90 million it raised in the wake of George Floyd's death in the summer of 2020.\n\nBLM spent about $12 million of those funds on luxury homes in Los Angeles and Toronto. That profligacy did not abate in the 2022 fiscal year, when the charity dropped more than $10.5 million on contractors, much of which went to companies linked to Cullors's friends and family.\n\nCullors's brother, Paul Cullors, made out especially well. A graffiti artist with no prior experience as a bodyguard, Paul Cullors and his two companies raked in $1.6 million providing \"professional security services\" for Black Lives Matter in 2022. Paul Cullors was also one of BLM's only two paid employees during the year, collecting a $126,000 salary as \"head of security\" on top of his consulting fees.\n\nBlack Lives Matter disclosed last May it had paid Paul Cullors a comparatively meager $841,000 to protect the charity's swanky $6 million Los Angeles mansion in its 2021 tax year, which Patrisse Cullors used to film herself baking peach cobblers. The charity told the Associated Press it could not entrust its security to the former police officers that staff typical private protection firms.\n\n\"While Patrisse Cullors was forced to resign due to charges of using BLM's funds for her personal use, it looks like she's still keeping it all in the family,\" said Paul Kamenar, an attorney for the National Legal and Policy Center watchdog group.\n\nBowers, the Black Lives Matter board member and close friend of Cullors, hauled in a hefty bounty during the charity's 2022 tax year. Black Lives Matter paid his company, Bowers Consulting, $1.7 million for management and consulting services.\n\nBowers's management of Black Lives Matter earned him few friends in the movement. Black Lives Matter Grassroots, a former sister organization of Black Lives Matter, accused Bowers of \"blazing a path of irreparable harm to BLM\" by treating the charity as his personal piggy bank.\n\n\"His actions have led [Black Lives Matter] into multiple investigations by the Internal Revenue Service and various state attorney generals,\" the lawsuit stated. \"Instead of using the donations for its intended purposes, Mr. Bowers diverted these donations to his own coffers and intentionally took calculated steps to prevent those same resources from being used by BLM for on-the-ground movement work.\"\n\nThe sister of former Black Lives Matter board member Raymond Howard brought in a seven-figure consulting fee as well. BLM paid Danielle Edwards's firm, New Impact Partners, $1.1 million for consulting services in 2022.\n\nBlack Lives Matter also agreed to pay an additional $600,000 to an unidentified former board member's consulting firm \"in connection with a contract dispute,\" the charity disclosed in its audited financial statements .\n\nNotably absent from Black Lives Matter's 2022 tax return is any mention of Trap Heals, the art firm run by the father of Cullors's only child, Damon Turner. BLM paid $969,000 to Trap Heals in 2021, and the two companies were identified as partners in press reports well into BLM's 2022 tax year. Charities are only required to disclose the names of their five highest compensated independent contractors.\n\nIt's unclear if Black Lives Matter paid out lucrative contracting fees to Cullors's friends and family past June 2022. The charity brought on a new board of directors last summer led by nonprofit adviser Cicley Gay, who has filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy three times since 2005.\n\nBlack Lives Matter did not return a request for comment.\n\nPublished under: Black Lives Matter , Feature , George Floyd , IRS , Taxes\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "Going For Broke: Black Lives Matter Revenues Dropped 88 Percent in 2022\n\n2022 wasn't a very good year for Black Lives Matter.\n\nThe Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation raised just $9.3 million in the fiscal year ending in June 2022-an 88 percent decrease from the year prior, according to records obtained by the Washington Free Beacon . It's a staggering decline from Black Lives Matter's heyday in the summer of 2020, when it parlayed the nationwide unrest that followed George Floyd's death into an $80 million financial bonanza.\n\nThe Black Lives Matter charity used that windfall to accumulate property and spread wealth to leadership while it could. Its founder, Patrisse Cullors, went on a cross-country real estate buying spree, snagging four properties in California and Georgia for a cool $3.2 million. The charity secretly purchased a glitzy $6 million compound in Los Angeles in October 2020 with donor cash, which Cullors used to film videos of herself drinking wine and baking peach cobblers. Not content with its budding American property empire, Black Lives Matter branched out to Canada, granting $8 million to its Canadian affiliate to finance the purchase of a Toronto mansion in July 2021 for $6.3 million.\n\nCullors's family and friends reaped benefits too. Financial disclosures released in May 2022 revealed Black Lives Matter paid her brother, Paul Cullors, $840,993 for \"professional security services,\" a sizable sum for the self-taught graffiti artist with no prior experience as a bodyguard. Paul Cullors went on to purchase his own Los Angeles home for $637,000 in December 2020. Black Lives Matter paid $969,459 to an art firm run by the father of Cullors's only child, Damon Turner. A consulting firm owned by a Black Lives Matter board member Shalomyah Bowers, a close associate of Cullors, received $2,167,894 for providing management services for the charity.\n\nBlack Lives Matters' troubles began when Cullors's personal real estate purchases surfaced in April 2021. The two activists who were supposed to replace her never took the job . Black Lives Matter fell so far behind in disclosing its finances to the public that several liberal states barred it from raising funds in their jurisdictions in early 2022. The charity voluntarily shut down its ability to raise funds in February 2022 amid the crackdown.\n\nThe pressure of having to disclose the self-dealing that went on at Black Lives Matter on watch was almost too much to bear for Cullors. She said during an April 2022 event that she gets \"triggered\" whenever she hears the term \"IRS Form 990,\" a standard financial disclosure document charities are required to file every year to the public.\n\n\"This doesn't seem safe for us, this 990 structure-this nonprofit system structure,\" Cullors said. \"This is, like, deeply unsafe. This is being literally weaponized against us, against the people we work with.\"\n\nBlack Lives Matter's Form 990 tax return covering its fiscal year starting July 2020 and ending July 2021 was ultimately weaponized, but not by the nefarious right-wing forces Cullors often claims to be persecuted by.\n\nBlack Lives Matter Grassroots, a former sister organization of Black Lives Matter, cited the charity's tax return in a September 2022 lawsuit accusing Bowers, a close associate of Cullors, of using the charity as his \"personal piggy bank.\" The lawsuit alleged Bowers siphoned an additional $10 million in \"fees\" from Black Lives Matter to his consulting firm on top of the $2,167,894 disclosed in the charity's Form 990.\n\nBowers \"continued to betray the public trust by self-dealing and breaching his fiduciary duties,\" BLM Grassroots said in its lawsuit. \"His actions have led [Black Lives Matter] into multiple investigations by the Internal Revenue Service and various state attorney generals, blazing a path of irreparable harm to BLM in less than eighteen months.\"\n\nThe Black Lives Matter charity's Form 990 for fiscal year 2022 was due to the IRS on Monday. Black Lives Matter did not respond to the Free Beacon's request for the public document, which it is required by law to provide, and the charity delayed providing a more detailed required financial statement to Florida.\n\nPublished under: Black Lives Matter , George Floyd\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "Black Activists Distance Themselves From Black Lives Matter Amid Financial Collapse\n\nBlack activists are distancing themselves from Black Lives Matter following a Washington Free Beacon report that the group is on the fast track to financial insolvency.\n\nA coalition of 26 local Black Lives Matter chapters once closely allied with the national group slammed the charity in a Tuesday statement , which laid the blame for the group's demise on cofounder Patrisse Cullors. Cullors, a self-proclaimed \"trained Marxist,\" has come under fire following revelations last year that Black Lives Matter used its charitable largesse to enrich her family and friends.\n\n\"The plummeting of donations to [Black Lives Matter] is further evidence that donors want to fund the work, not high-priced consultants,\" the coalition, Black Lives Matter Grassroots, said in the statement, adding that it is now \"engaged in a fight for the soul of Black Lives Matter.\"\n\nTax documents obtained by the Free Beacon show that Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, the national arm of the movement, blew through two-thirds of the $90 million the group raised following George Floyd's death in the summer of 2020 and suffered a massive drop in donations in its 2022 fiscal year.\n\nBlack Lives Matter during the tax year ending June 2022 spent more than $10.5 million on high-priced contractors, many of whom share close ties with Cullors. Two companies run by her brother, Paul Cullors, in 2022 raked in $1.6 million providing \"professional security services\" for Black Lives Matter. He also collected a $126,000 salary working as \"head of security\" for the embattled charity, a job that entailed protecting the swanky $6 million Los Angeles mansion the charity secretly purchased with donor cash in 2021.\n\nShalomyah Bowers, Cullors's close associate and chosen successor to lead the charity after she resigned in May 2021, brought in $1.7 million to his company, Bowers Consulting, providing management and consulting services to Black Lives Matter in its 2022 tax year.\n\nBowers's control of Black Lives Matter proved to be the breaking point between the national group and the local chapters that the group once represented across the country. Black Lives Matter in 2020 founded and operated BLM Grassroots, but the coalition broke away in 2022 as several liberal states cracked down on the charity for widespread compliance issues.\n\nBLM Grassroots in September filed a lawsuit against Black Lives Matter and Bowers, alleging that Bowers used the charity as his \"personal piggy bank\" to fraudulently siphon $10 million in \"fees\" to his company.\n\nBowers \"continued to betray the public trust by self-dealing and breaching his fiduciary duties,\" the coalition said in its lawsuit. \"His actions have led [Black Lives Matter] into multiple investigations by the Internal Revenue Service and various state attorney generals, blazing a path of irreparable harm to BLM in less than 18 months.\"\n\nBLM Grassroots director Melina Abdullah claimed Tuesday that she had no idea Black Lives Matter was squandering charitable funds before the two groups broke apart.\n\n\"We view Black Lives Matter as a movement. So I've been less vocal about what's been happening inside of Black Lives Matter that I frankly have nothing to do with,\" Abdullah said on the podcast Roland Martin Unfiltered . \"At the time I didn't know anything about dollars coming in or about, you know, who's getting paid what.\"\n\nBlack Lives Matter did not return a request for comment.\n\nPublished under: Black Lives Matter , Crime , IRS , Taxes\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "Prominent BLM Activist Behind Protests Targeting Daniel Penny, Attacking Jury Process\n\nA charity run by a prominent Black Lives Matter activist is behind protests against Daniel Penny-the Marine veteran charged with the murder of a man on the New York subway last year-and undermining confidence in the jury ahead of its verdict, a Washington Free Beacon review of public records found.\n\nBlack Opportunities, which describes itself as \"the new path forward to liberate black people from oppression,\" helped organize a group of roughly 50 demonstrators outside the Manhattan Supreme Court where Penny's trial was held. There, members of the organization shouted \"Murderer, Murderer\" and waved signs that said \"Convict Daniel Penny\" and contained links to the Black Opportunities website.\n\nBlack Opportunities shares close ties with Black Lives Matter Greater New York, which has also been involved in organizing protests against Penny since his trial started in October. Both organizations were founded by longtime Black Lives Matter activist Hawk Newsome, who has taken to calling Penny the \"Subway Strangler.\"\n\nPenny was charged with second-degree manslaughter and negligent homicide in May 2023, days after his altercation with a homeless man named Jordan Neely on the subway. Neely entered Penny's car and began threatening those onboard before Penny put him into a headlock, which a medical examiner found was the cause of Neely's death. Prosecutors rested their case on Tuesday. The jury is currently deliberating a verdict.\n\nPenny's arrest prompted many Americans to rally to his defense , calling him a good Samaritan who was protecting his fellow riders. Newsome has used other nicknames for the former Marine, labeling him a \"white supremacist hero.\"\n\n\"It is safe to assume that Danny Penny 'The Subway Strangler' is embracing the celebrity that comes with being a race-based white supremacist hero,\" Newsome said in an Oct. 29 press release one day before the jury in the case was finalized. \"Danny Penny shows up to court with a high-powered personal security team with three SUVs valued at over $250,000 collectively. And now he is using jury selection specialists who help defendants that hunt BLM protesters get away with murder.\"\n\nNewsome has sought to instill doubt in the jury before it renders its verdict, calling the jury selection process \"racist\" in a Nov. 1 press release . Newsome alleges that Penny's defense team struck a black woman from the jury \"because of her purple hair.\"\n\n\"The allegations of racist practices in the jury selection process cannot be taken lightly!\" Newsome said. \"Especially when we consider that 8 of the 9 the Stranglers defense team chose we [sic] people of color.\"\n\nThough Newsome is a prominent Black Lives Matter activist, he and his organizations don't share official ties with Black Lives Matter Global Network, the national charity that raised $90 million during the George Floyd riots in 2020. Those funds were later used to purchase ritzy mansions and enrich the friends and family of its co-founder, Patrisse Cullors.\n\nNewsome garnered headlines in 2021 for cutting ties with the national Black Lives Matter group and calling for an \"independent investigation\" into its finances. He launched Black Opportunities shortly thereafter.\n\nBut Black Opportunities is shrouded in financial secrecy as well. Although it currently accepts donations on its website , the IRS revoked its nonprofit status in May for failing to file any tax returns since its founding. No financial information about the group is publicly available, which nonprofits are required to provide.\n\nNor is it clear what charitable activities Black Opportunities engages in. Much of the organization's website is dedicated to selling apparel, such as sweatshirts and t-shirts that say \"F- THE MAYOR.\"\n\nEven with those tax problems, some New York Democrats haven't cut ties with Black Opportunities. In August, the organization held a block party in West Harlem that was sponsored by former New York City councilwoman Kristin Richardson Jordan (D.).\n\nNewsome did not return a request for comment.\n\nPublished under: Black Lives Matter , Daniel Penny , Jordan Neely , New York\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "Support for Black Lives Matters Hits New Low, Survey Finds\n\nAmericans' support for the Black Lives Matter movement hit a new low in recent polling, far below the movement's peak support during the 2020 George Floyd riots.\n\nFifty-one percent of U.S. adults said they support Black Lives Matter in a poll conducted in April by the Pew Research Center. That number has fallen from a high of 67 percent in June 2020, when only 31 percent of adults said they oppose the movement. Now, 46 percent say they do not support Black Lives Matter.\n\nThe fall in support comes as the finances of the group that became the face of the movement have been called into question. The Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation's revenues fell 88 percent from 2021 to 2022, the Washington Free Beacon reported . The founders of Black Lives Matter Global used donations to enrich themselves and their friends. The group spent around $15 million on real estate in 2020 and 2021, including a $6 million mansion.\n\nProminent Black Lives Matter activist Shaun King saw his income nearly triple in 2021, even as his activist group's revenue fell more than 60 percent.\n\nA slim minority of Americans believe that Black Lives Matter has brought about tangible change, the Pew Research Center reported :\n\nIn assessing the impact of the Black Lives Matter movement, 32% say it's been highly effective at bringing attention to racism against Black people. Smaller shares say the same about increasing police accountability (14%), improving the lives of Black people (8%) and improving race relations (7%). Overall, 31% of Americans say they understand the goals of the Black Lives Matter movement extremely or very well.\n\nPublished under: Black Lives Matter\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"
