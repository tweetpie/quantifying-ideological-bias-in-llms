      "text": "Of course Nancy Pelosi has no plans to begin impeachment proceedings\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told lawmakers Monday that there are no plans to immediately begin impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump, multiple news outlets reported.\n\nIn a conference call with rank-and-file members, Pelosi reportedly made clear that the party's strategy in the wake of the public release of a redacted version of special counsel Robert Mueller's report was to focus on aggressively investigating the president and see where its various wide-ranging probes lead.\n\n\" We have to save our democracy. This isn't about Democrats or Republicans. It's about saving our democracy,\" Pelosi said, according to NBC News. \"If it is what we need to do to honor our responsibility to the Constitution - if that's the place the facts take us, that's the place we have to go.\"\n\n\"We don't have to go to articles of impeachment to obtain the facts, the presentation of facts,\" she added.\n\nThe call marked the first time House Democrats have discussed as a unit since last week's release of the Mueller report, which detailed his nearly-two year investigation into allegations of collusion between Trump's campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential election and whether the president himself attempted to obstruct the probe. Congress has been out of session for a two-week recess over the Easter and Passover holidays.\n\nThe call came just hours after Pelosi argued in a letter to her colleagues that while Democrats \"should proceed down a path of finding the truth,\" it is \"important to know that the facts regarding holding the president accountable can be gained outside of impeachment proceedings.\"\n\n\"Whether currently indictable or not, it is clear that the president has, at a minimum, engaged in highly unethical and unscrupulous behavior which does not bring honor to the office he holds,\" she wrote.\n\nAlthough Pelosi would not commit to initiating impeachment proceedings, seemingly concerned that it would cause political blowback for the party, her comments to lawmakers Monday signaled a shift in her approach to the issue. The California Democrat had effectively taken impeachment off the table last month when she said impeaching Trump was \"just not worth it.\"\n\nAlthough Pelosi urged cautiousness in her letter and during her call with lawmakers, some Democrats reportedly expressed support for impeachment.\n\nRep. Val Demings, D-Fla., a member of the House Judiciary Committee, said she believes Congress has enough evidence to begin proceedings on Monday's call.\n\n\"As a 27-year law enforcement officer, and while I understand we need to see the full report and all supporting documents, I believe we have enough evidence now,\" Demings said.\n\nRep. Jared Huffman, D-Calif., said, \"It's bad for the country if Congress punts. I think the script has flipped on political calculations. It's far harder to defend inaction in the face of what we know.\"\n\nMueller, in the 448-page redacted report released last week, did not find that Trump's campaign conspired with Russia to interfere in the 2016 presidential election, although identified ten episodes of possible obstruction of justice by the president.\n\nAlthough top Democrats have responded to Mueller's report with exceedingly cautious remarks about impeachment , demands for the special counsel's unredacted findings and calls for further hearings, the progressive wing of the party has appeared ready to oust the president.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on Friday became the first 2020 presidential hopeful to call on the House of Representatives to start impeachment proceedings against Trump. Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., said they would sign onto an impeachment resolution introduced by Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.\n\nDemocratic presidential contender Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., on Monday agreed that Congress should take steps toward impeachment.\n\n\"I believe Congress should take the steps towards impeachment,\" Harris said during a town hall broadcast on CNN. \"But I want to say this, because it doesn't end there. I also want to say this: I'm also a realist . . . Since I've been in the United States Senate, that the United States Senate and the Republicans hold the majority, I've not seen any evidence to suggest that they will weigh on the facts instead of on partisan adherence to being protective of this president. And that's what concerns me, and what will be the eventual outcome. We have to be realistic about the end result, but that doesn't mean the process should not take hold.\"\n\nAs Democrats remain divided about whether they should impeach Trump in the fallout of Mueller's report, they will consider the challenges that removing the president from office would entail.\n\nWhile voting on articles of impeachment requires only a simple majority in the House, where Democrats have a majority, the president's case would then move to the Senate, where two-thirds of all senators would need to agree to convict the president on any count. If that happens, a president is automatically removed from office. At least twenty Senate Republicans would need to join Democrats to vote to remove the president, and it's unlikely enough GOP senators would vote as such. Following Mueller's report, a majority of Senate Republicans did not appear to be put off by the picture Mueller paints of Trump."

One destiny': House Speaker Nancy Pelosi steps down from Democratic leadership\n\nUnited States House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-California) announced on Thursday that she \"will not seek reelection to Democratic leadership\" in the 118th Congress.\n\nDemocrats lost their five-seat House majority in last week's midterm elections, handing Republicans a slim but very real edge in the lower congressional chamber.\n\nRepresentative Kevin McCarthy (R-California), the current minority leader, is widely expected to be chosen as the next Speaker. On Wednesday, 188 members of the House GOP caucus nominated him for the job, which would begin when the new Congress is sworn in on January 3rd, 2022.\n\nIn her address, Pelosi touted her work with \"three presidents\" - George W.

      "text": "Nancy Pelosi announces that she's caving to conservative Democrats' demands\n\nOn Monday night, multiple outlets reported that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told her caucus that she is giving in to the demands of conservative Democrats in the ongoing negotiations over two separate spending bills.\n\nThroughout the months-long negotiation process, it has been the position of President Joe Biden, Pelosi, and progressive Democrats in Congress that the two bills could only be passed together, not one at a time. This was crucial because while a limited but pivotal number of more conservative Democrats in Congress are passionate about passing the smaller, bipartisan bill focused on funding the nation's physical infrastructure, progressives are more committed to passing the larger package focused on climate policy and social spending programs. By tying the two packages together, all sides of the caucus could be satisfied, and Biden could make significant progress in carrying out his agenda.\n\nBut those plans have come crashing down. After the Senate passed a bipartisan infrastructure bill this summer, some conservative Democratic lawmakers started demanding that the House pass the legislation and the president sign it into law as soon as possible. But members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, led by Rep. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, said they would vote down the bipartisan bill if it came before the House alone. They fear that if the bipartisan bill becomes law first, the conservative Democrats will have little incentive to work on the larger package, known as the reconciliation bill. Democratic lawmakers like Arizona's Sen. Kyrsten Sinema and West Virginia's Joe Manchin will be able to dramatically curtail the reconciliation bill's provisions and undermine its goals or even block it altogether, and the progressives will have no way to force their hand.\n\nOn Monday, though, as CNN's Manu Raju reported, Pelosi told her members that they will be moving forward to a vote on the bipartisan bill on Thursday without the reconciliation bill.\n\nPelosi's explanation makes no sense - it's just a way for her to save face while caving. The whole point of passing the bills together was to keep everyone on board and united. But the conservative Democrats have undermined that plan by making demands that the reconciliation bill be scaled back and that the infrastructure bill be passed immediately - which is exactly what the progressives feared all along.\n\nIt's possible Pelosi thinks this is her best bet. Manchin, Sinema, and their allies may be so furious if the infrastructure bill doesn't pass first that they'll tank both bills. But if that's the case, it's not clear why Pelosi made the two-track plan in the first place. By caving on it now, she just exposes the weakness of her own position.\n\nAnd it may end up costing all of them. Jayapal has said repeatedly that she had enough votes to block the infrastructure bill if it's brought to the floor before the reconciliation package. It's possible she's misguided or bluffing, but if not, a failed vote would be a humiliating loss for Pelosi on the House floor and a major obstacle for the Democrats' legislative agenda."

Bush over his ill-conceived invasion of Iraq.\n\n\"What is the frivolity of how they're treating impeachment? You know, when I first became speaker in '07, January, I was so deluged with requests to impeach the president, Bush, for the War in Iraq,\" Pelosi stated. \"I've strenuously opposed the war in Iraq. I said at the time as the top Democrat on intelligence, 'The intelligence does not support the threat. It was a misrepresentation to the American people.'\"\n\nPOLL: Should Trump be allowed to hold office again?\n\nPelosi explained that while Bush's incursion was a catastrophe, it \"was a policy matter, and I was not going to impeach the president, even though there was, as Senator Graham, who was the top Democrat in the Senate, and actually the chairman of the [Judiciary] Committee - Bob Graham, Bob Graham of Texas - called for the president to be impeached. But I wasn't going to do that because I just think that it was, you know, a terrible, this War in Iraq was the worst mistake a country ever made and the consequences continue. But nonetheless, just because people were calling for it didn't mean I was going to do it.\"\n\nPelosi then fast-forwarded to ex-President Donald Trump, who was impeached and acquitted twice during his single four-year term.\n\n\"So when it came time for the former occupant of the White House, I don't use his name,\" Pelosi quipped, \"it was unavoidable because the facts were so overwhelming that he committed acts of high treason.\"\n\nWatch below or at this link .\n\nMSNBC 09 17 2023 09 16 18 www.youtube.com"

      "text": "Bidding farewell to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\n\nOn Tuesday, the biggest show in Washington, D.C., is the Kevin McCarthy roast. It may not have a cavalcade of D-list comedy stars wearing rental tuxes, but it absolutely contains a lot of jokes-most of them preceded by the words \"Representative\" and followed by an \"(R).\" But even as we're all enjoying this showcase of weakness, disorganization, and self-inflicted political wounds, today is absolutely a sad day for what we're losing.\n\nToday is the end of an era when the House was skillfully operated by someone who was indefatigable in working through issues, consummately skilled in finding the votes necessary to secure support for a bill, and absolutely historic in the role she has played in Congress. Today is the real end of the era of Nancy Pelosi.\n\nShe may still be around, but her hand at the wheel-patient, persuasive, and powerful-will definitely be missed.\n\nAs The New York Times reports, the first woman to ever lead either chamber of the U.S. Congress will long be remembered, not just for breaking through a giant glass ceiling, but for her ability to organize the House and deliver votes:\n\nHer presence will be felt for years in the climate, health care, public works and social legislation she ushered through to signatures by two Democratic presidents, as well as the big moments of her tenure capped off by the electrifying invitation to Volodymyr Zelensky to address Congress just days before she lost the gavel.\n\nWhat's easy to miss, as we watch McCarthy stumble through what may be the opening moments of a \"leadership position\" for which he has surrendered every ounce of leadership, as well as common decency, is that Pelosi has led a Democratic House that is far more diverse than anything Republicans have dealt with in decades. McCarthy is already failing to hold together a slim majority where everyone is in stark agreement on every major point. Pelosi handled much greater challenges regularly, and did it so easily that it was rarely noticed.\n\nRepublicans have a tent that goes all the way from hard-line conservatives to ridiculously hard-line conservatives. Pelosi has been faced with a House where the members of her own party span the whole gamut of the left, the middle, and even a bit of the right. She's driven through climate change legislation even when members of her party were from states where fossil fuels play a huge role. She's lifted up health care even when it meant going against both insurance and pharmaceutical industries that funded critical campaigns.\n\nMost of all, she has demonstrated an unmatched organizational skill that persuaded individual members to soften, delay, or even surrender their individual demands in order to build legislation that met the challenge of the day. Nancy Pelosi is the champion of not allowing the perfect to become the enemy of the good. That's often left people in her own party angry or disappointed. It's also left America much better off for her efforts.\n\n\"The fact of the matter is no other speaker in the modern era, Republican or Democrat, has wielded the gavel with such authority or such consistent results,\" said former Republican speaker John Boehner. \"Let me just say you are one tough cookie.\"\n\nIt is a rare thing to see a politician who can wed their moral compass and willingness to seek compromise; someone capable of setting aside personal goals in service to the party and nation; a person so willing to suffer public outrage to obtain benefits for the same people screaming for her defeat. With Pelosi, all of this was so obvious, that it was often simply ignored. She wasn't just ready to risk everything to get what America needed, she did it reflexively.\n\nNancy Pelosi was never a great speaker, but she may be the greatest Speaker the nation has ever seen. And it is going to be some time before we see her like again.\n\nIf you have some time to spare, give this a watch.\n\nPelosi's Power (full documentary) | FRONTLINE youtu.be"
