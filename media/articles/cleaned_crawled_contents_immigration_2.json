      "text": "US immigration officials look to expand social media data collection\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nVenezuelan migrant Yender Romero shows the U.S. Customs and Border Protection One app on his cell phone, at a migrant tent camp in Mexico City, Jan. 20, 2025. (AP Photo/Fernando Llano, File)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) - U.S. immigration officials are asking the public and federal agencies to comment on a proposal to collect social media handles from people applying for benefits such as green cards or citizenship, to comply with an executive order from President Donald Trump.\n\nThe March 5 notice raised alarms from immigration and free speech advocates because it appears to expand the government's reach in social media surveillance to people already vetted and in the U.S. legally, such as asylum seekers, green card and citizenship applicants -- and not just those applying to enter the country. That said, social media monitoring by immigration officials has been a practice for over a decade, since at least the second Obama administration and ramping up under Trump's first term.\n\nBelow are some questions and answers on what the new proposal means and how it might expand social media surveillance.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security issued a 60-day notice asking for public commentary on its plan to comply with Trump's executive order titled \"Protecting the United States from Foreign Terrorists and Other National Security and Public Safety Threats.\" The plan calls for \"uniform vetting standards\" and screening people for grounds of inadmissibility to the U.S., as well as identify verification and \"national security screening.\" It seeks to collect social media handles and the names of platforms, although not passwords.\n\nThe policy seeks to require people to share their social media handles when applying for U.S. citizenship, green card, asylum and other immigration benefits. The proposal is open to feedback from the public until May 5.\n\n\"The basic requirements that are in place right now is that people who are applying for immigrant and non-immigrant visas have to provide their social media handles,\" said Rachel Levinson-Waldman, managing director of the Brennan Center's Liberty and National Security Program at New York University. \"Where I could see this impacting is someone who came into the country before visa-related social media handle collection started, so they wouldn't have provided it before and now they're being required to. Or maybe they did before, but their social media use has changed.\"\n\n\"This fairly widely expanded policy to collect them for everyone applying for any kind of immigration benefit, including people who have already been vetted quite extensively,\" she added.\n\nWhat this points to - along with other signals the administration is sending such as detaining people and revoking student visas for participating in campus protests that the government deems antisemitic and sympathetic to the militant Palestinian group Hamas - Levinson-Waldman added, is the increased use of social media to \"make these very high-stakes determinations about people.\"\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service said the agency seeks to \"strengthen fraud detection, prevent identity theft, and support the enforcement of rigorous screening and vetting measures to the fullest extent possible.\"\n\n\"These efforts ensure that those seeking immigration benefits to live and work in the United States do not threaten public safety, undermine national security, or promote harmful anti-American ideologies,\" the statement continued. USCIS estimates that the proposed policy change will affect about 3.6 million people.\n\nThe U.S. government began ramping up the use of social media for immigration vetting in 2014 under then-President Barack Obama, according to the Brennan Center for Justice . In late 2015, the Department of Homeland Security began both \"manual and automatic screening of the social media accounts of a limited number of individuals applying to travel to the United States, through various non-public pilot programs,\" the nonpartisan law and policy institute explains on its website.\n\nIn May 2017, the U.S. Department of State issued an emergency notice to increase the screening of visa applicants. Brennan, along with other civil and human rights groups, opposed the move, arguing that it is \"excessively burdensome and vague, is apt to chill speech, is discriminatory against Muslims, and has no security benefit.\"\n\nTwo years later, the State Department began collecting social media handles from \"nearly all foreigners\" applying for visas to travel to the U.S. - about 15 million people a year.\n\nArtificial intelligence tools used to comb through potentially millions of social media accounts have evolved over the past decade, although experts caution that such tools have limits and can make mistakes.\n\nLeon Rodriguez, who served as the director of USCIS from 2014 to 2017 and now practices as an immigration attorney, said while AI could be used as a first screening tool, he doesn't think \"we're anywhere close to where AI will be able to exercise the judgment of a trained fraud detection and national security officer\" or that of someone in an intelligence agency.\n\n\"It's also possible that I will miss stuff,\" he added. \"Because AI is still very much driven by specific search criteria and it's possible that the search criteria won't hit actionable content.\"\n\n\"Social media is just a stew, so much different information - some of it is reliable, some of it isn't. Some of it can be clearly attributed to somebody, some of it can't. And it can be very hard to interpret,\" Levinson-Waldman said. \"So I think as a baseline matter, just using social media to make high-stakes decisions is quite concerning.\"\n\nThen there's the First Amendment.\n\n\"It's by and large established that people in the U.S. have First Amendment rights,\" she said. This includes people who are not citizens. \"And obviously, there are complicated ways that that plays out. There is also fairly broad authority for the government to do something like revoking somebody's visa, if you're not a citizen, then there's steps that the government can take - but by and large, with very narrow exceptions, that cannot be on the grounds of speech that would be protected (by the First Amendment).\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\n▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration\n\nThe Trump administration has transferred hundreds of immigrants to El Salvador even as a federal judge issued an order temporarily barring the deportations under an 18th century wartime declaration targeting Venezuelan gang members, officials said Sunday. Flights were in the air at the time of the ruling.\n\nU.S. District Judge James E. Boasberg issued an order Saturday temporarily blocking the deportations, but lawyers told him there were already two planes with immigrants in the air - one headed for El Salvador, the other for Honduras. Boasberg verbally ordered the planes be turned around, but they apparently were not and he did not include the directive in his written order.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, in a statement Sunday, responded to speculation about whether the administration was flouting court orders: \"The administration did not 'refuse to comply' with a court order. The order, which had no lawful basis, was issued after terrorist TdA aliens had already been removed from U.S. territory.\"\n\nThe acronym refers to the Tren de Aragua gang, which Trump targeted in his unusual proclamation that was released Saturday\n\nIn a court filing Sunday, the Department of Justice, which has appealed Boasberg's decision, said it would not use the Trump proclamation he blocked for further deportations if his decision is not overturned.\n\nTrump sidestepped a question over whether his administration violated a court order while speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Sunday evening.\n\nRepublican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump speaks along the southern border with Mexico, on Aug. 22, 2024, in Sierra Vista, Ariz. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)\n\n\"I don't know. You have to speak to the lawyers about that,\" he said, although he defended the deportations. \"I can tell you this. These were bad people.\"\n\nAsked about invoking presidential powers used in times of war, Trump said, \"This is a time of war,\" describing the influx of criminal migrants as \"an invasion.\"\n\nTrump's allies were gleeful over the results.\n\n\"Oopsie...Too late,\" Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who agreed to house about 300 immigrants for a year at a cost of $6 million in his country's prisons, wrote on the social media site X above an article about Boasberg's ruling. That post was recirculated by White House communications director Steven Cheung.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio, who negotiated an earlier deal with Bukele to house immigrants, posted on the site: \"We sent over 250 alien enemy members of Tren de Aragua which El Salvador has agreed to hold in their very good jails at a fair price that will also save our taxpayer dollars.\"\n\nSteve Vladeck, a professor at the Georgetown University Law Center, said that Boasberg's verbal directive to turn around the planes was not technically part of his final order but that the Trump administration clearly violated the \"spirit\" of it.\n\n\"This just incentivizes future courts to be hyper specific in their orders and not give the government any wiggle room,\" Vladeck said.\n\nThe immigrants were deported after Trump's declaration of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which has been used only three times in U.S. history.\n\nIn this photo provided by El Salvador's presidential press office, a prison guard transfers deportees from the U.S., alleged to be Venezuelan gang members, to the Terrorism Confinement Center in Tecoluca, El Salvador, Sunday, March 16, 2025. (El Salvador presidential press office via AP)\n\nThe law, invoked during the War of 1812 and World Wars I and II, requires a president to declare the United States is at war, giving him extraordinary powers to detain or remove foreigners who otherwise would have protections under immigration or criminal laws. It was last used to justify the detention of Japanese-American civilians during World War II.\n\nVenezuela's government in a statement Sunday rejected the use of Trump's declaration of the law, characterizing it as evocative of \"the darkest episodes in human history, from slavery to the horror of the Nazi concentration camps .\"\n\nTren de Aragua originated in an infamously lawless prison in the central state of Aragua and accompanied an exodus of millions of Venezuelans, the overwhelming majority of whom were seeking better living conditions after their nation's economy came undone during the past decade. Trump seized on the gang during his campaign to paint misleading pictures of communities that he contended were \"taken over\" by what were actually a handful of lawbreakers.\n\nThe Trump administration has not identified the immigrants deported, provided any evidence they are in fact members of Tren de Aragua or that they committed any crimes in the United States. It also sent two top members of the Salvadoran MS-13 gang to El Salvador who had been arrested in the United States.\n\nVideo released by El Salvador's government Sunday showed men exiting airplanes onto an airport tarmac lined by officers in riot gear. The men, who had their hands and ankles shackled, struggled to walk as officers pushed their heads down to have them bend down at the waist.\n\nThe video also showed the men being transported to prison in a large convoy of buses guarded by police and military vehicles and at least one helicopter. The men were shown kneeling on the ground as their heads were shaved before they changed into the prison's all-white uniform - knee-length shorts, T-shirt, socks and rubber clogs - and placed in cells.\n\nThe immigrants were taken to the notorious CECOT facility, the centerpiece of Bukele's push to pacify his once violence-wracked country through tough police measures and limits on basic rights\n\nThe Trump administration said the president actually signed the proclamation contending Tren de Aragua was invading the United States on Friday night but didn't announce it until Saturday afternoon. Immigration lawyers said that, late Friday, they noticed Venezuelans who otherwise couldn't be deported under immigration law being moved to Texas for deportation flights. They began to file lawsuits to halt the transfers.\n\n\"Basically any Venezuelan citizen in the US may be removed on pretext of belonging to Tren de Aragua, with no chance at defense,\" Adam Isacson of the Washington Office for Latin America, a human rights group, warned on X.\n\nThe litigation that led to the hold on deportations was filed on behalf of five Venezuelans held in Texas who lawyers said were concerned they'd be falsely accused of being members of the gang. Once the act is invoked, they warned, Trump could simply declare anyone a Tren de Aragua member and remove them from the country.\n\nBoasberg barred those Venezuelans' deportations Saturday morning when the suit was filed, but only broadened it to all people in federal custody who could be targeted by the act after his afternoon hearing. He noted that the law has never before been used outside of a congressionally declared war and that plaintiffs may successfully argue Trump exceeded his legal authority in invoking it.\n\nThe bar on deportations stands for up to 14 days and the immigrants will remain in federal custody during that time. Boasberg has scheduled a hearing Friday to hear additional arguments in the case.\n\nHe said he had to act because the immigrants whose deportations may actually violate the U.S. Constitution deserved a chance to have their pleas heard in court.\n\n\"Once they're out of the country,\" Boasberg said, \"there's little I could do.\"\n\n_____\n\nCano reported from Caracas, Venezuela.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(RJ Sangosti/The Denver Post via AP)\n\nDENVER (AP) - A lawyer for a prominent immigration activist arrested this month told a judge Friday that authorities appear to be retaliating against Jeanette Vizguerra years after she took refuge in Denver churches to avoid deportation during the first Trump administration.\n\nVizguerra was arrested in the parking lot of the Denver-area Target store where she worked on March 17.\n\n\"We finally got you,\" agents told Vizguerra, according to her attorney, Laura Lichter.\n\nLichter told U.S. District Judge Nina Wang that she suspects Vizguerra was being targeted because she was exercising her First Amendment right to speech. Lichter cited unspecified media and social media reports as evidence of retaliation.\n\nLichter declined to elaborate on what speech she believed Vizguerra was being targeted for, but drew a connection between her detention and the detention of others, including protesters on college campuses , who have been detained by immigration authorities recently.\n\n\"I believe that the targeting here of Jeanette is in line with what we are seeing in other types of cases where people are being targeted for showing up at protests, for posting certain messages on social media, for having a particular opinion,\" Lichter said.\n\nLawyers had been set to argue over whether U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement could continue holding Vizguerra in detention in suburban Denver. Lawyers say she is being held on an invalid deportation order from 2013.\n\nBut Wang delayed those arguments after Vizguerra's lawyers said they would change their legal challenge to also claim that her First Amendment rights were being violated.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Timothy Jafek said the government did not object to the change but did not respond to the retaliation allegation in court.\n\nICE says Vizguerra entered the U.S. from Mexico illegally in 1997 and is being held pending deportation. In a statement shortly after her arrest, ICE said the mother of four has a final deportation order and \"has received legal due process in U.S. immigration court.\"\n\nAs they have done with other arrests recently, agency officials posted a photo on social media of Vizguerra being taken into custody with her hands behind her back and a chain around her waist.\n\nWang issued an order halting Vizguerra's deportation while the legal challenge plays out. She has noted the case raises \"complex issues\" about immigration law and she could not find a similar case.\n\nICE began trying to deport Vizguerra in 2009 during the Obama administration after she was pulled over in suburban Denver and found to have a fraudulent Social Security card with her own name and birth date but someone else's number, according to a 2019 lawsuit she brought against ICE. Vizguerra did not know the number belonged to someone else at the time, the lawsuit said.\n\nWhile a judge issued an order of removal against her, she also was given the option to leave the country voluntarily, which she ultimately did to try to see her mother before she died in 2012, her lawyers said in the current petition before Wang.\n\nICE wrongfully reissued a deportation order for her in 2013 and did not provide proper notice to Vizguerra, the petition says.\n\nWhile Vizguerra has received multiple deportation delays in the past, her last stay expired over a year ago in February 2024, lawyers for the government said in a response to her petition. Until now, they say Vizguerra has never challenged the deportation order with the federal appeals court, which they say is the court that should decide whether it is valid.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Murphy ruled that people with final orders of removal must have \"a meaningful opportunity\" to argue that being sent to a third country presents a level of danger deemed worthy of protection. His order remains in effect until the case advances to the next stage of arguments.\n\nThe decision is a setback for an administration that has sent people to countries including Panama, Costa Rica and El Salvador when it is difficult to deport them to their homelands. In some cases a judge may determine that a person's homeland is too dangerous but authorities can send them to a third country.\n\nThe Homeland Security Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but administration attorneys argued that a temporary halt would interfere with immigration enforcement.\n\nMurphy, who was appointed by President Joe Biden, sided with advocacy groups including the National Immigration Litigation Alliance, which sued Sunday in Boston on behalf of people who were transferred to third countries or feared they would be soon.\n\nOne plaintiff, identified only by initials in court filings, is a Guatemalan man who was sent to Mexico, where he says he was previously raped. A U.S. immigration judge determined that it was unsafe for him to go to Guatemala, but the man did not have a chance to argue against being sent to Mexico. The man is \"hiding\" in Guatemala.\n\nAn immigration judge ruled that another plaintiff could not be returned to Honduras, but she fears she will be sent to a third country when she appears for a mandatory check-in next week at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement offices in Dallas.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Denis Poroy)\n\nThe Trump administration is touting an immigration crackdown that includes putting shackled immigrants on U.S. military planes, expanding agents' arrests of people here illegally and abandoning programs that gave some permission to stay.\n\nOne tool that's conspicuously absent from President Donald Trump's efforts to reduce illegal immigration: Going after the businesses that hire workers who are in the U.S. illegally.\n\nA nearly 30-year-old government system called E-Verify makes it easy to check if potential employees can legally work in the U.S.\n\nThe program has had high-profile backers. Project 2025, the far-right blueprint for Trump's second term, called for it to be mandatory.\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers use a chain to aid in restraining a detained person using handcuffs positioned in front, Monday, Jan. 27, 2025, in Silver Spring, Md. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)\n\nYet it remains largely voluntary and rarely enforced. Trump's own hotels and golf courses were slow to adopt E-Verify.\n\nThe debate over workplace enforcement is, in many ways, a reflection of America's complex views on immigration, its economic dependence on immigrant labor and a quietly bubbling Republican divide.\n\n\"There are only so many people you can round up and deport\" who are criminals or fugitives, said Mark Krikorian , executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for reduced immigration and has close ties to the Trump administration. \"To make a deep reduction in the illegal population it has to be done at least in part through workplace enforcement.\"\n\nTrump's order declaring a national emergency at the southern border used dark terms, describing a country in chaos due to an immigrant \"invasion\" He has linked illegal immigration to violent crime and claimed countries are emptying prisons, mental institutions and \"insane asylums\" to send dangerous people to the U.S.\n\nThe reality is often far more prosaic. Many immigrants living here illegally are working . They're fixing roofs and cars, putting up drywall and running hotels. They're making sure shoppers have lettuce, milk and apples.\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers wait to detain a person, Jan. 27, 2025, in Silver Spring, Md. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon, File)\n\nE-Verify, an online Department of Homeland Security system launched in the late 1990s, can quickly confirm if someone is authorized to work in the U.S., often by using Social Security numbers.\n\nBarely 20% of U.S. employers use it. The 1.3 million that do include Walmart, Starbucks and Home Depot.\n\nEven its staunchest defenders acknowledge there are plenty of ways to cheat it. But most states with E-Verify mandates saw reduced numbers of immigrants working illegally, according to a 2017 study from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.\n\nThat, the researchers said, may also discourage more people from entering the U.S. illegally.\n\n\"You have to reduce the incentive to cross the border\" by making it more difficult to work in the U.S., said Krikorian. \"You have to reduce that magnet.\"\n\nYet over the years it has been opposed by everyone from Republican immigration hawks to Idaho dairy farmers, New York hotel owners and construction industry lobbyists.\n\nDuring the first Trump administration's budget proposals, language calling for mandatory nationwide E-Verify use was quietly dropped.\n\nIn one state legislature after another, many of them Republican dominated, occasional attempts to mandate E-Verify for all employers - or even most - have repeatedly failed. Where it has been mandated, many employers are often exempted.\n\nU.S. Marines deploy along the U.S.-Mexico border near the San Ysidro Port of Entry, Friday, Feb. 7, 2025, in San Diego. Tijuana, Mexico in seen in the background. (AP Photo/Denis Poroy)\n\nRepublican lawmakers outnumber Democrats 5-to-1 in Idaho. They've blasted illegal immigration , and Gov. Brad Little has deployed state troopers to the \"lawless southern border.\"\n\nBut they've also pushed back against attempts to require E-Verify.\n\nAgriculture is one of Idaho's top industries, and its history is steeped in immigration, from the Basque sheepherders of the late 1800s to today's Dutch-born dairy farmers who spent their childhoods in Nazi-occupied Holland.\n\nThose dairy farmers, in turn, are dependent on more recent immigrants, mostly from Mexico and Central America, who are often in the U.S. illegally. The Idaho Dairyman's Association estimates that some 90% of those workers are foreign-born.\n\nLittle recently told reporters that mandatory E-Verify would be a burden for businesses.\n\n\"That's going to be an issue,\" said Little, who grew up in a prominent ranching family and still runs a small cattle operation. \"It's not black and white.\"\n\nThe problem, people here say, is that mass deportations or mandatory E-Verify programs would create critical labor shortages unless they are paired with new legal pathways for immigrant workers.\n\nThe state's large dairy industry in particular needs year-round employees and can't depend on visa programs for seasonal agricultural workers.\n\n\"It's basic math,\" said Rick Naerebout, CEO of the Idaho Dairyman's Association. \"If you remove the unauthorized portion of the agriculture workforce, at that point we don't have the ability to produce enough food to feed ourselves.\"\n\n\"The level of anxiousness for both producers and their workers right now isn't healthy,\" he added.\n\nLast month, state Rep. Jaron Crane, a Republican who has praised Trump's immigration crackdown, introduced a bill to create an agricultural guest worker program for Idaho that would be open to many people living in the U.S. illegally.\n\nFormer Idaho Solicitor General Theo Wold, who served in multiple positions in the first Trump administration, responded that it would undermine the current administration's efforts.\n\n\"Does anyone think this is what Idaho voters wanted when they overwhelmingly voted to send President Trump back to the White House?\" Wold wrote on X.\n\nWhen pressed, Trump administration officials say they will be going after the companies that hire people who are in the U.S. illegally, as well as the workers.\n\n\"You can count on worksite enforcement coming back,\" border czar Tom Homan said in a recent interview.\n\nSo far, though, workplace raids remain very rare.\n\nTrump, who in 2016 called for E-Verify to be required for every employer, has seemingly remained silent about the program since returning to office.\n\nIn 2019, amid reports that some workers at Trump businesses were in the U.S. illegally, Trump's son Eric, the executive vice president of the family company, said it would \" institute E-Verify at any property not currently utilizing this system.\"\n\nBut the E-Verify registry shows it took years for many Trump properties to sign up.\n\nTrump Organization officials did not reply to repeated requests for comment.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Kristi Noem, Secretary of Homeland Security, appears before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee for her confirmation hearing in Washington, Friday, Jan. 17, 2025. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh, File)\n\nImmigration officials say anyone living in the U.S. illegally will soon have to register with the federal government , and those who don't could face fines, imprisonment or both.\n\nThe registry will be mandatory for everyone 14 and older who doesn't have legal status, according to a Tuesday statement from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, a branch of the Department of Homeland Security . Each person must register and provide their fingerprints and address, the statement says, and parents and guardians of anyone under age 14 must ensure they are registered.\n\nHere are some details about the registry - the latest in a string of Trump administration moves tied to campaign promises to crack down on illegal immigration and deport millions living in the country illegally:\n\nFederal immigration law has long required that people living illegally in the U.S. register with the government. Those laws can be traced back to the Alien Registration Act of 1940, which came amid heightened growing fears of immigrants and political subversives in the early days of World War II. The current requirements stem from the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952.\n\nA system set up after 9/11, the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System, required all noncitizen males age 16 or older from 25 countries - all but one of them majority Arab or Muslim - to register with the U.S. government. The program led to no terrorism convictions but pulled more than 13,000 people into deportation proceedings. It was suspended in 2011 and dissolved in 2016.\n\nAcross the decades, though, scholars say the registration requirement has rarely been enforced.\n\nOfficials say that now will change.\n\n\"The Trump administration will enforce all our immigration laws - we will not pick and choose which laws we will enforce,\" Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement. \"We must know who is in our country for the safety and security of our homeland and all Americans.\"\n\nIn part, Tuesday's Homeland Security statement was purely bureaucratic, a way to announce that the law is again being enforced and how people should register.\n\nOfficials said they'd \"soon announce a form and process for aliens to complete the registration requirement.\" On its website, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service directs people to create an online account and says additional information on registering will be available \"in the coming days.\"\n\n\"No alien will have an excuse for failure to comply with this law,\" the statement said.\n\nThe USCIS website indicated that people who register would be given some form of identity card, which anyone over age 18 \"must carry and keep in their possession at all times.\"\n\nThe announcement of the registry allows the Trump administration to flex its political muscle on the key issue of immigration. It's also a signal to people living in the U.S. illegally.\n\n\"If you leave now, you may have the opportunity to return and enjoy our freedom and live the American dream,\" McLaughlin's statement said.\n\nLike much about the registry, that's unclear for now. But legal scholars say the practical consequences may not matter, as people already living below the legal radar are unlikely to register, which would make them far easier to deport.\n\n\"But even if it doesn't actually accomplish much in terms of deporting more people, it sends a signal to the American people that \"We're cracking down on immigrants,\" and it will also heighten the fear immigrants already have about what's going on,\" said Stephen Yale-Loehr, a longtime immigration law scholar and retired Cornell Law School professor.\n\nAdvocates blasted the announcement.\n\nHeidi Altman, vice president of policy at the National Immigration Law Center, said in a statement that it \"harkens back to shameful episodes in U.S. history of government-sanctions discrimination against immigrants and people of color.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Rebecca Santana contributed reporting.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

It's the first time population influx from immigration has outpaced native births since the Census began to collect data on nativity in 1850, according to the organization's latest roundup of frequently requested statistics on immigration . The U.S. immigrant population grew by 1.6 million over that period-a 3.6 percent increase and the largest annual rise since 2010. The U.S. immigrant population is now at 47.8 million people or 14.3 percent of the total population, which is close to the record set in 1890 of 14.8 percent. U.S. birth rates have recently reached historic lows, according to the National Center for Health Statistics. President Donald Trump has made border security and unauthorized immigration a key part of his administration's policy platform . The institute's report notes that the vast majority of immigrants, about 73 percent, have permanent legal status.\n\nReporter\n\nGot a tip?

But to do so, he said, will require mixed-immigration families-those with undocumented immigrants with children who are U.S. citizens-to leave together.\n\n\"I don't want to be breaking up families, so the only way you don't break up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all back,\" he said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump appeared to acknowledge the policy will prove to be unpopular, but he claimed it was necessary to ensure laws were followed.\n\n\"You can always find something out like, you know, 'This doesn't work. That doesn't work,'\" Trump said. \"I'll tell you what's going to be horrible, when we take a wonderful young woman who's with a criminal. And they show the woman, and she could stay by the law, but they show the woman being taken out. Or they want her out and your cameras are focused on her as she's crying as she's being taken out of our country. And then the public turns against us. But we have to do our job. And you have to have a series of standards and a series of laws. And in the end, look, our country is a mess.\"\n\nThe family-separation policy was implemented by the first Trump administration in 2017, prompting steady waves of backlash and scrutiny for the \"zero tolerance\" standard. Trump's incoming \"border czar\" Tom Homan has vowed to reinstate the policy, telling CBS in October that families \"can be deported together.\" Trump said on Sunday he agreed with Homan.\n\nTrump also promised he would end birthright citizenship on the first day of his administration, saying he would find a way to circumvent the 14th Amendment's edict that grants citizenship.\n\n\"We're going to have to get it changed,\" he said. \"We'll maybe have to go back to the people. But we have to end it.\"\n\nMedia Reporter\n\ncorbin.bolies@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

ICE did not return comment when questioned by CNN.\n\nThose who were contacted in their workplaces were taken to a room and asked to present documentation, she added.\n\nNygren advised Navajo citizens to carry state-issued IDs, such as a driver's license and other picture identification, as well as their Certificate of Indian Blood (CIB).\n\nNative Americans are citizens of the U.S. The problem, however, is that it remains unclear whether ICE agents and law enforcement officials view the CIB as acceptable documentation of citizenship.\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\nJanuary 23, 2025\n\nNaabik'íyáti' Committee calls on President Nygren for immediate action regarding...\n\nSenator Theresa Hatathlie said many tribal members who possessed both state-issued IDs and CIBs were still detained or questioned by ICE officials.\n\n\"There's a lot of frustration happening here on the Navajo Nation on how to address this,\" Curley said. \"Many fear for the threat of being deported.\"\n\nNygren told Navajo citizens to contact Operation Rainbow Bridge , an immigration crisis initiative, if they run into issues with federal immigration officials.\n\nThe Daily Beast reached out to a spokesperson for Navajo Nation but did not receive a response.\n\nTrump's long-promised deportation efforts began with the arrests of hundreds on Sunday .

      "text": "Harry's Drug Use Escapes Scrutiny as Court Releases Immigration Papers\n\nEuropean Editor at Large\n\nPrince Harry can breathe a sigh of relief.\n\nHeavily redacted documents published by a U.S. court today have failed to shed any light on whether or not the former party prince declared he had used drugs when he emigrated to the United States.\n\nThe 82 pages of documents, largely in response to Freedom of Information requests, were published at the order of a D.C. court with vast swathes of text blacked out.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHowever, in one key segment, a non-redacted section of text confirmed that there was no \"evidence of government misconduct\" and that the records did \"not support such an allegation but show the regulatory process involved in reviewing and granting immigration benefits was done in compliance with the Immigration and Nationality Act, and applicable rules and regulations.\"\n\nImmigration campaigners allied to the Trump administration had been hoping that the document dump Tuesday would reveal whether or not Prince Harry admitted to using drugs when he moved to the U.S.\n\nThe publication of the paperwork is the latest twist in a case brought by The Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank behind the controversial Project 2025 initiative, and revolves around Harry's admission of drug use in his bestselling memoir Spare . He said he used cocaine, magic mushrooms, marijuana and ayahuasca.\n\nHeritage claims drug use would usually disqualify an individual from obtaining a visa, and want the DoJ to publish documents to show if Harry lied or received a special waiver from the Biden administration.\n\nCourts had previously ruled that Harry had a right to expect the DoJ to respect his privacy and not publish his paperwork, but that changed with last week's ruling by a Donald Trump -appointed judge, following months of legal wrangling. The U.S. government is now under order to lodge on the docket redacted versions of Harry's application documents by Tuesday.\n\nTrump recently said he would not deport Harry because \"he's got enough problems with his wife,\" however the visa application still has the potential to embarrass the Duke of Sussex.\n\nOne possibility that has been floated is that Harry is on an A-1 visa, typically reserved for heads of state, which could make any concerns about drug use irrelevant. Harry's team has always said he was \"truthful\" in his application.\n\nThe Daily Beast has previously reported on the residency risk Harry could face if Trump, who has a personal animus toward him and Meghan, were elected.\n\nAn immigration lawyer told the Daily Beast that Harry could be vulnerable to a politically motivated attack on his residential status, saying: \"Department of State decisions are discretionary and very susceptible to political influence. His visa could be canceled. He could be denied entry upon return to the U.S. from foreign travel for inadmissibility due to prior drug usage, despite an unexpired visa in his passport. There are many scenarios where political influence could impact Harry's ability to re-enter the U.S.\"\n\nBritish TV star Nigella Lawson was denied entry to the U.S. over admissions of drug use in 2013.\n\nThe Sussex-Trump feud dates back to a 2016 Comedy Central show in which Meghan, then an actress and not linked to Harry, expressed her contempt for Trump, labeling him \"misogynistic\" and \"divisive.\"\n\nTrump later referred to her comment as \" nasty \" and in 2022, Trump told Piers Morgan : \"Harry is whipped like no person I think I've ever seen.\"\n\nHe predicted the couple would divorce, saying, \"It'll end, and it'll end bad... I want to know what's going to happen when Harry decides he's had enough of being bossed around... Or maybe when she decides that she likes some other guy better. I want to know what's going to happen when it ends, OK?\"\n\nEric Trump earlier this year called the duke and duchess \"spoiled apples,\" adding, \"You can happily have those two. We might not want them anymore; it feels like they're on an island of their own.\"\n\nNile Gardiner of the Heritage Foundation said: \"The fight continues, I think it's just a matter of time until the new administration reveals Prince Harry's immigration records.\"\n\nEuropean Editor at Large\n\ntom.sykes@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Biden Broke With Obama on Immigration, Only to Become Just Like Him\n\nOn Monday morning, President Joe Biden is slated to virtually address the National Immigrant Integration Conference, the largest gathering of immigration and refugee advocates in the country, with a list of his priorities for reforming the nation's immigration system.\n\nBut for all of the campaign promises to fix what even Biden has called a \"long-broken and chaotic\" system, his pre-recorded remarks will fall on the ears of increasingly skeptical attorneys, activists, and civil rights leaders who say that Biden's actions on immigration are merely an Obama-era redux-or even a slick repackaging of President Donald Trump's worst policies.\n\n\"On the campaign trail, now-President Biden went to great lengths to establish the dramatic differences between himself and Donald Trump-and few policy areas were more divergent than the handling of immigration,\" said Jacinta Gonzalez, senior campaign organizer with Mijente, a Latino political group. \"But immigration organizers continue to feel whiplash.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDuring the campaign, Biden pledged to break from President Barack Obama's approach to immigration, acknowledging in his final debate with Trump that \"we made a mistake\" on immigration during his time as vice president.\n\n\"We made a mistake-it took too long to get it right,\" Biden said at the time, pledging to \"immediately\" put DACA recipients on a path to citizenship and to send a pathway to citizenship to Congress.\n\n\"Many of them are model citizens,\" Biden said of undocumented immigrants. \"Over 20,000 of them are first responders out there taking care of people during this crisis. We owe them. We owe them.\"\n\nNine months into the Biden administration, he has made good on his pledge to send an immigration reform bill to Congress, but advocates for immigration reform still have a long list of grievances: the continued reliance on a dubious public health order to bar nearly all asylum seekers from entering the country; putting the blame for the bungled extraction of Afghan interpreters and translators following the fall of Kabul on the interpreters and translators themselves ; borderline-dangerous housing conditions for the few unaccompanied minors who are allowed to remain in the United States as they seek asylum; and the abuse of Haitian migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border by U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents last month.\n\nA U.S. border patrol officer grabs the shirt of a migrant trying to return to the United States along the Rio Grande.\n\nBut even the inarguable improvements implemented  by the Biden administration are leaving advocates feeling like the president's expansive campaign promises on immigration are just a regression to Obama-era enforcement. Case in point, last week's announcement that the Department of Homeland Security had issued new guidelines on immigration enforcement, which the department said would better focus resources \"on the apprehension and removal of noncitizens who are a threat to our national security, public safety, and border security.\"\n\n\"For the first time, our guidelines will, in the pursuit of public safety, require an assessment of the individual and take into account the totality of the facts and circumstances,\" Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement announcing the guidelines . \"In exercising this discretion, we are guided by the knowledge that there are individuals in our country who have been here for generations and contributed to our country's well-being, including those who have been on the frontline in the battle against COVID, lead congregations of faith, and teach our children.\"\n\nImmigrant-rights advocates say guidelines announced by Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas are a rollback to the Obama administration's approach towards undocumented immigrants,\n\nBut immigrant-rights advocates are already calling the guidelines a rollback to the Obama administration's similar approach towards undocumented immigrants, which led to the deportation of a record number of undocumented people from the United States, including children, DACA recipients and others who felt that they were lulled into a false sense of security. Nearly 1.2 million undocumented people were deported from the United States in the first three years of Obama's administration; fewer than 800,000 were deported during the same period of Trump's presidency.\n\nThe higher numbers are due to numerous factors, including country of origin and the increased length of time that migrants were held in immigrant detention before being removed, but were in large part due to the administration's ability to streamline deportations. With fewer targets for removal, there are fewer chances for more complicated cases-those involving unaccompanied minors, potential asylees, and families-from jamming up the system.\n\n\"Given ICE's well-documented history of abusing its power to detain and deport our community members, we know this guidance alone will not reign in the agents entrusted to implement this guidance in good faith,\" said Layla Razavi, co-interim executive director of Freedom for Immigrants. \"Without shrinking or dismantling the massive, militarized presence amassed by ICE and CBP, immigrant communities will continue to be funneled into the abusive immigration detention system.\"\n\nThe fact that the guidelines make recently arrived undocumented immigrants-including those seeking asylum-an enforcement priority has particularly angered advocates. Per the guidelines, an undocumented immigrant is deemed to pose \"a threat to border security\" and is a priority for removal if they have arrived in the United States in the past eleven months.\n\n\"Punishing recently arrived asylum seekers by designating them as enforcement priorities is cruel and inhumane,\" said Robyn Barnard, senior advocacy counsel at Human Rights First. \"It inflicts further trauma on those who have left everything behind to find safety.\"\n\nBarnard, who called the Biden administration's effective continuation of a Trump-era policy of forcing asylum seekers to remain in Mexico \"perverse,\" said that the recent-arrival priority could run afoul of international law.\n\n\"Treating people seeking refugee protection as priorities for arrest and deportation would moreover flout U.S. legal obligations under the Refugee Convention and Protocol, which makes clear that people seeking refuge should not be penalized.\"\n\nThe White House has bristled at the notion that Biden's policies in any way echo Trump's, from immigration to COVID-19 to international arms deals , noting that the president campaigned on reversing course from the previous White House's approach to nearly every issue foreign and domestic.\n\n\"Title 42 is a public health requirement... because we're in the middle of a pandemic, which, by the way, we would have made progress on had the former President actually addressed the pandemic and not suggested people inject bleach,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said last week, in response to a question comparing Biden's policies to those of his predecessor. \"So, I think we're in a bit of a different place.\"\n\nBut not different enough, according to advocates, who intend to devote much of the National Immigrant Integration Conference's agenda to the issue of Title 42, the public health order that effectively bars almost all asylum seekers from entering the United States in the name of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"We call on the Biden administration to rescind Title 42, slash the budget for all enforcement, and honor its campaign promise to end private detention,\" said Razavi. \"Immigrants are human beings and valued members of our communities-they're our neighbors, parents, and loved ones. It's time this administration treated them as such.\"\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "My Grandparents' Immigration Woes Were Tragically Like Today's\n\nI'm named for my two grandmothers, Mary and Kay, and my mother trained me not to answer to \"Mary,\" lest I leave her mother out. Growing up, I was lucky to know all four of my grandparents, and my latest novel, American Ending , is inspired by their story: immigrants who face exploitation, discrimination, a pandemic, and the heartbreak of who gets to be an American citizen-100 years ago.\n\nI could not find my people on the bookshelf, Old Believer Russian Orthodox who consider theirs the one true church-Catholics broke off from them. Like most fundamentalist sects, they are rich in rules, starting with food: no milk, meat, or eggs for six weeks before Easter or Christmas, on Wednesdays, Fridays, and saints' days. During services, which are conducted in Church Slavonic, women and men stand on opposites sides of the church, and the women wear long skirts and cover their hair (which it is a sin to cut; wearing makeup is also a sin). So is smoking, because your body is a temple, but not drinking, because Christ's first miracle was turning water into wine. They are, after all, Russian.\n\nThe two sides of my family arrived here from Suwalki, Russia (now Poland) to mine coal in the Appalachian town of Marianna, Pennsylvania. The men suffered from black lung (as did my maternal grandfather), lost a limb in explosions, or died in cave-ins. The women married at 14 (my paternal grandmother) and gave birth to a house full of children, who in turn became miners or child brides. Their story deserves to be told. Not having it on record furthers the insult that America's industrial success was fueled by exploiting them, akin to overlooking that both the White House and the U.S. Capitol were built by enslaved people. Both sets of grandparents got themselves out of the mines to Erie, where there was another Old Believer Church-there are only five or six in America.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nToni Morrison famously said, \"If there's a book that you want to read, but it hasn't been written yet, then you must write it.\" Émigré fiction by Russian and Polish Jewish authors abounds; by my people, not so much. Old Believers kept to themselves. They didn't exactly welcome visitors, members had to marry within the church, and Church Slavonic is not spoken outside of services (my great-grandfather copied the prayer books by hand). Old Believers stopped the clock in 1666, refusing to adopt the Gregorian calendar or any liturgical reforms. Martyrs and priests died defending the one true church rather than change a single word in the Nicene Creed or cross themselves differently, so you can imagine how questioning or spinning tales about them in a novel might go over.\n\nNonetheless, I was the child curious enough to ask questions. Though my father's job took us to Oklahoma, my mother read us Russian fairy tales and taught us about the church. Summers, we drove cross country to Erie for large family reunions and church services. My mother's mother loved the hymns and Russian folksongs. She romanticized their culture, but my Aunt Pearl would have none of it. \"Russia,\" she'd wave her hand in front of my grandmother, as if to break the spell. \"The men drank too much, and they beat their wives.\"\n\nThey both talked about life in the mines, and imagining what they went through-especially the women-got me started on a book. What made the writing urgent was understanding something my father's family had been trying to tell me for years. My father and his many siblings, who called his parents Ma and Pa, repeated this refrain: \"Ma lost her citizenship when she married Pa.\" The aunts and uncles said it like a nursery rhyme, and it had as little sense as one to me. Mary Zuravleff was born in America-in Erie, Pennsylvania-and never moved out of the state. When I searched for her written records, I found her 1908 marriage license, which records her age as 18 (she was 14), as does the 1910 census (she was 16 by then and already a mother). By the 1920 census, her age is recorded as 26, finally her real age, and she has six children, the fifth and sixth being identical twins.\n\nRemember the hoopla preceding the 2020 census surrounding citizenship-Would asking about citizenship keep people from filling it out? Would the answers be used against them? The 1920 census has a citizenship section. The first box asks for the year of immigration, if applicable. That square is blank for my grandmother, as it should be. The next asks the question \"Naturalized or Alien?\" which should be blank as well. But there is a mark in that square or what looks to be something scribbled out, until you magnify the tiny form. Because on closer examination, I could see that inside the square are the letters \" Al .\" For alien.\n\n\"Ma lost her citizenship when she married Pa.\" Alien is a powerful word-a painful word-and that label introduced me to a little-known episode in American immigration law. Starting in 1907, American women who married foreign-born men lost their citizenship! The law didn't affect American men who married foreign-born women, and when a new law was finally made, the women didn't get their citizenship restored. If their husbands became naturalized, the Cable Act of 1922 stated, these American-born women who'd been stripped of their birthright could apply to be U.S. citizens. To see my grandmother declared an alien infuriated me, and the fact that no one I talked to had heard of this law made the novel a necessity.\n\nI spun a tale combining both sets of grandparents into one family-telling the story through Yelena, the first American born in her family. These Old Believers leave two daughters behind to come here, which was the case on my mother's side (they left three behind). In their Appalachian town, boys quit grade school for the mines and girls are married off as teenagers, giving birth to more babies than they can feed. When Yelena and her younger siblings ask Ma for a bedtime story, she asks them, \"Russian ending or American ending?\" That refrain haunts Yelena's life, and American Ending became the book's title.\n\nI wrapped up the first draft during the last presidential administration, as the day's headlines reported on parents and legislators who wanted to keep America's unflattering history from our children. I was writing about America's restrictive immigration laws and a deadly pandemic showing up in World War I veterans, as the America outside my studio was separating immigrant children from their parents and debating whether to include citizenship on the next census. One day, instead of typing 1919, I typed 2019, and I leapt back from my keyboard, as if it had delivered an electrical jolt. In fact, I was shocked to think that everything that was happening in America had already happened.\n\nRight around this time, a local community group invited me to read from my work in progress, and I saw what a different experience sharing this book was going to be. My earlier novels revel in absurdity and invention. At readings, people tend to ask how on earth I made up my characters, or they talk about my humor and playfulness with language. At this event, after I shared my family's background and read a short selection, people urgently rushed to the podium. They were compelled to tell me stories of their family's American ending. The book was both beside the point and precisely the point as people told tales of horrific discrimination and unfairness alongside examples of random generosity or luck that turned a relative's life around. Again and again, people wanted to share their terrible losses as well as their relatives' heroic efforts to make a life.\n\nDo novelists choose their subject matter or does their subject matter choose them? Writers constantly debate this, and I thought I had been weaving fairy tales and church dogma with the grit and humor of a family I'd mostly had to imagine, incorporating stories here and there that I'd heard throughout my life.\n\nHonestly, it wasn't until I described my novel to a potential agent that I realized how long this book had been brewing. When my mother named me for my two grandmothers-Mary, who lost her citizenship for marrying my Russian-born grandfather, and Kay, who forced the mining company to pay in cash rather than scrip and then got her husband away from the mines before black lung killed him-could she have imagined that I'd write a novel honoring their stories?\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "'Detention Alley': inside the Ice centres in the US south where foreign students and undocumented migrants languish\n\nForeign nationals caught up in Trump's immigration dragnet are transported sometimes thousands of miles away to an isolated network of lockups and courts\n\nBehind the reinforced doors of courtroom number two, at a remote detention centre in central Louisiana , Lu Xianying sat alone before an immigration judge unable to communicate.\n\nDressed in a blue jumpsuit that drooped from his slight frame, he waited as court staff called three different translation services, unable to find an interpreter proficient in his native Gan Chinese.\n\nLike almost all of the 17 detainees appearing before Judge Kandra Robbins during removal proceedings on Tuesday morning, Lu had no attorney because there is no automatic right to legal representation in US immigration proceedings. He sat silently, evidently confused. A substitute interpreter was eventually found, and began translating the judge's questions into Mandarin.\n\n\"I am afraid to return to China,\" he told the court, as he described how he had already filed an asylum application after crossing the border into Texas in March 2024. Lu said he was worried a lawyer had stolen his money and not submitted his asylum claim. Lu, who had only recently been detained , struggled to understand, as the judge asked him to list his country of return should he be deported.\n\n\"Right now my order is to be removed?\" He asked. \"Or should I go to court?\"\n\nThe judge explained that he was present in court, and provided him another asylum application form . His next hearing was scheduled for April.\n\nThe LaSalle immigration court , inside a sprawling Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention centre in rural Jena, Louisiana, has been thrust into the spotlight in recent weeks after the former Columbia graduate student Mahmoud Khalil was transferred here earlier this month. His case has drawn international attention as the Trump administration attempts to deport the pro-Palestinian activist under rarely used executive provisions of US immigration law . The government is fighting vigorously to keep Khalil's case in Louisiana and he is due to appear again at the LaSalle court for removal proceedings on 8 April.\n\nBut it has also renewed focus on the network of remote immigration detention centres that stretch between Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi, known as \"Detention Alley\" - where 14 of the country's 20 largest detention centres are clustered. And now where other students have since been sent after being arrested thousands of miles away.\n\nBadar Khan Suri, a research student at Georgetown University, was arrested in Virginia last week and sent to a detention centre in Alexandria, Louisiana, and then on to another site, Prairieland in eastern Texas. This week, Rumeysa Ozturk, a doctoral student at Tufts University, was arrested in Massachusetts and sent to the South Louisiana Ice processing centre in the swamplands of Evangeline parish.\n\nThese distant detention facilities and court systems have long been associated with rights violations , poor medical treatment and due process concerns , which advocates argue are only likely to intensify during the Trump administration's immigration crackdown and promise to carry out mass deportations that has already led to a surge in the detention population . But rarely do cases within these centres attract much public attention or individual scrutiny.\n\n\"Most of the folks in detention in Louisiana aren't the ones making the news,\" said Andrew Perry, an immigrant rights attorney at the ACLU of Louisiana. \"But they are experiencing similar, if not the same, treatment as those who are.\"\n\nTo observe a snapshot of the more than 1,100 other detainees confined at the facility also holding Khalil, the Guardian travelled to Jena and witnessed a full day inside the LaSalle court, which is rarely visited by journalists. Dozens lined up for their short appearances before a judge and were sworn in en masse. Some expressed severe health concerns, others frustration over a lack of legal representation. Many had been transferred to the centre from states hundreds of miles away.\n\nEarlier in the morning Wilfredo Espinoza, a migrant from Honduras, appeared before Judge Robbins for a procedural update on his asylum case that was due for a full hearing in May. Espinoza, who coughed throughout his appearance and had a small bandage on his face, had no lawyer and informed the court he wished to abandon his asylum application \"because of my health\". The circumstances of his detention and timing and location of his arrest by Ice were not made clear in court.\n\nHe suffered from hypertension and fatty liver disease, he said through a Spanish translator. \"I've had three issues with my heart here,\" he said. \"I don't want to be here any more. I can't be locked up for this long. I want to leave.\"\n\nThe judge asked him repeatedly if he was entering his decision of his own free will. \"Yes,\" he said. \"I just want to leave here as quickly as possible.\"\n\nThe judge ordered his removal from the US.\n\nSubstantiated allegations of medical neglect have plagued the Jena facility for years. In 2018, the civil rights division of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) examined the circumstances of four fatalities at the facility , which is operated by the Geo Group, a private corrections company. All four deaths occurred between January 2016 and March 2017 and the DHS identified a pattern of delay in medical care, citing \"failure of nursing staff to report abnormal vital signs\".\n\nAt the South Louisiana Ice processing centre, an all-female facility that is also operated by the Geo Group and where Ozturk is now being held, the ACLU of Louisiana recently filed a complaint to the DHS's civil rights division alleging an array of rights violations. These included inadequate access to medical care, with the complaint stating: \"Guards left detained people suffering from severe conditions like external bleeding, tremors, and sprained limbs unattended to, refusing them access to diagnostic care\".\n\nThe complaint was filed in December 2024, before the Trump administration moved to gut the DHS's civil rights division earlier this month .\n\nSign up to This Week in Trumpland\n\nA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nA spokesperson for the Geo Group said the company \"strongly disagrees with the allegations that have been made regarding services we provide at Geo-contracted Ice processing centres\" including the facility in Jena.\n\n\"In all instances, our contracted services are monitored by the federal government to ensure strict compliance with applicable federal standards,\" the spokesperson said, pointing to Ice's performance-based national detention standards that the company's contracts are governed by.\n\nThe spokesperson added: \"These allegations are part of a longstanding, politically motivated, and radical campaign to abolish Ice and end federal immigration detention by attacking the federal government's immigration facility contracts.\"\n\nThe DHS did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nLouisiana experienced a surge in immigration detention during the first Trump administration. At the end of 2016, the state had capacity for a little more than 2,000 immigrant detainees, which more than doubled within two years. A wave of new Ice detention centres opened in remote, rural locations often at facilities previously used as private prisons . The state now holds the second largest number of detained immigrants, behind only Texas. Almost 7,000 people were held as of February 2025 at nine facilities in Louisiana, all operated by private companies.\n\n\"It is this warehousing of immigrants in rural, isolated, 'out of sight, of mind' locations,\" said Homero López, the legal director of Immigration Services and Legal Advocacy in Louisiana and a former appellate immigration judge. \"It's difficult on attorneys, on family members, on community support systems to even get to folks. And therefore it's a lot easier on government to present their case. They can just bulldoze people through the process.\"\n\nAt the LaSalle court this week, the Guardian observed detainees transferred from states as far away as Arizona, Florida and Tennessee. In an afternoon hearing, where 15 detainees made an application for bond, which would release them from custody and transfer their case to a court closer to home, only two were granted.\n\nCases heard from detention are far less likely to result in relief. At LaSalle, 78.6% of asylum cases are rejected, compared with the national average of 57.7%, according to the Trac immigration data project . In Judge Robbins's court, 52% of asylum applicants appear without an attorney.\n\nIn the afternoon session, the court heard from Fernando Altamarino, a Mexican national, who was transferred to Jena from Panama City, Florida, more than 500 miles away. Altamarino had no criminal record, like almost 50% of immigrants currently detained by Ice . He had been arrested by agents about a month ago, after he received a traffic ticket following a minor car accident.\n\nHe tried to resolve the matter at his local courthouse, and was instead detained by immigration authorities. Via his lawyer, the court heard his application for release. A letter from a leader in his local church described his role as a stalwart member of the congregation and \"a man who truly embodies faith\".\n\nBut a prosecutor for the DHS, who opposed all but one bond application that afternoon, argued that Altamarino, who had lived in the country for more than a decade, presented a flight risk due to his \"very limited to non-existent family ties to the US\".\n\nThe judge concurred, as Altamarino sat upright and listened through a translator. Despite acknowledging he was \"not a danger to community\", she sided with the government and denied bond.\n\nAltamarino thanked the judge as he left the room, under watch of a guard. The heavy door closed behind him as he headed back into the void of America's vast detention system."

      "text": "How to protect your phone and data privacy at the US border\n\nWith reports of people being turned away at airports over messages found on devices, here's what to do to minimize risks\n\nWelcome to Opt Out , a semi-regular column in which we help you navigate your online privacy and show you how to say no to surveillance. The last column covered what to do with your 23andMe account after the company filed bankruptcy . If you'd like to skip to a section about a particular tip, click the \"Jump to\" menu at the top of this article.\n\nIf you're a visa or green card holder with plans to travel to the US, reports of people being turned away at airports over messages found on their devices might be prompting you to second-guess your travel plans. You might be asking whether Customs and Border Protection (CBP) can search your phone, whether you can opt out and what you should do to minimize your risks.\n\nThe short answer is that yes, CBP can search your devices. Constitutional protections are generally weaker at US borders, including airports. You can try to opt out, but depending on your specific circumstances, you might not be willing to risk the potential ramifications of not complying, which can include the confiscation of your devices.\n\nPrivacy experts say everyone should conduct a personal risk assessment - which should include your immigration status, travel history and what data you might have on your phone. There's not a one-size-fits all solution because data that may seem sensitive to some may not be to others, depending on your circumstances. That assessment might affect your calculus of whether to push back if CBP attempts to search your phone, for instance, or how much you want to lock down your devices before heading to the airport.\n\nWhile CBP said it only searched about 47,000 devices of the 420 million people who crossed the US border in 2024, experts the Guardian spoke to say border enforcement has been unpredictable under the Trump administration, so figuring out whether you're at risk of a device search is not as straightforward as it once was. French officials said a French scientist was recently turned away at an airport in Texas because immigration officers found texts that were critical of Trump on his phone.\n\n\"The super-conservative perspective is to assume they are completely unhinged and that even the most benign reasons for travel are going to subject non-citizens to these device searches,\" said Sophia Cope, a senior staff attorney at the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), a non-profit digital rights group.\n\nIf you're a US citizen, you must be admitted into the country. That said, some jurisdictions allow CBP to work with the FBI or local police to advance domestic investigations, so there are still some risks of your devices being searched for domestic reasons.\n\nThere are steps you can take to make it harder for CBP officers to access your device and the data on it. So what should you do to protect the data on your phone from being searched? The main thing is to prepare ahead of heading to the airport. Here is what you should be thinking about:\n\nBefore you travel, start to prepare for the possibility of being pulled into secondary screening. First, you should decide if you're going to comply if an immigration officer asks if they can search your device. They may ask for your phone password or for you to unlock the device. Ideally, you would unlock the device yourself and not share your password. You can decide not to give your consent, but that does come with its own risks.\n\nFrom a guide to the border from the EFF: \"This presents a no-win dilemma. If a traveler complies, then the agents can scrutinize and copy their sensitive digital information. If a traveler declines, then the agents can seize their devices and subject the traveler to additional questioning and detention.\"\n\nIt's possible that, if you refuse the search, the officer might decide that you are not worth the trouble because you do not present a high risk. They might let you go. On the flip side, though, declining could make the process longer or could result in border agents confiscating your device. If they do confiscate your device, make sure you ask for a property receipt so you can document that they have your device when you try to get it back. Even if you don't give up your password, immigration officials can use various tools on your device to unlock it themselves. They can also try to guess your password, so make sure you have a strong and long password.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons you might not want to risk being held back longer than you already have been or risk having your device confiscated - including that you don't know how long border agents will keep your phone.\n\nIf you plan to comply with a phone search to avoid any further complications, your phone might be searched either manually or with forensic tools. It is worthwhile to prepare for both types of searches.\n\nThe EFF recommends turning your devices completely off before entering the US. This could return your phone or laptop to a heightened security state and, as a result, could make it harder for anyone to break the encryption on your device.\n\nPrivacy advocates also recommend making sure your device requires a password to decrypt or unlock. If you use Face ID or a fingerprint to unlock your phone, for instance, it would be easier for an officer to use it to gain access to your device.\n\nYou might think the most protective options are to completely wipe your phone before traveling, use a burner or travel without a phone. But the EFF's Cope said that could actually raise suspicions.\n\n\"People are damned if they do and damned if they don't,\" Cope said. \"If you cross the border with no data on your device, that itself can be seen as suspicious.\"\n\nInstead, if you want to seem cooperative but do have data or texts stored on your phone that you wouldn't want to be accessed, Cope suggests deleting that information selectively rather than wiping your whole device.\n\nSign up to TechScape\n\nA weekly dive in to how technology is shaping our lives\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nThe most important step to take before you travel is to encrypt the data on your device, which is different than using encrypted messaging services like Signal. Device encryption can make it harder for CBP officers to access files on your phone or laptop or recover deleted files, even if they confiscate the device and subject it to sophisticated forensic tools.\n\nFortunately, all recent models of both iPhones and most Android phones come with full-device encryption automatically turned on. On an Android, double check that yours is on in the \"advanced settings\" tab of your \"Security\" menu. You will want to choose a strong password that is not easy to guess so CBP can't walk in the front door to your device. Here's a good primer on how to make a strong password.\n\n\"This encryption is only as good as the encryption passphrase someone uses on their device, though,\" said EFF senior staff technologist Bill Budington. \"So the best advice is to choose a strong, nine- to 12-random-character (or four- to five-word) passphrase for the device, and make sure that biometric unlocks like Face ID or Touch ID are turned off when going through sensitive areas like checkpoints or somewhere your device could be confiscated.\"\n\nLaptops, on the other hand, do not all come with full-device encryption. You can use the encryption tools some of them offer to encrypt your data. MacOS has a tool called FileVault, which you can access by searching for it in the top right corner of your screen, and some Windows computers come with a tool called Bitlocker, which can be used to encrypt your device. The EFF has a full list of tools you can use on various operating systems here .\n\nFor those of you traveling with a device owned by your employer or someone else, you will want to make sure to have a conversation with them before you travel to ensure your device is sufficiently protected.\n\nIn addition to encrypting your devices, you should delete any specific texts, apps, photos, etc that you feel are sensitive or you wouldn't want a government agent to see.\n\nSecurely deleting this data requires a few steps and comes with limitations. If you are not wiping your phone entirely, as that may raise suspicions, you will probably opt to delete specific files. That more practical option may be effective for a manual or cursory search but may not be sufficient in the event of a more advanced search by US immigration personnel. Files may not be fully deleted, or there may be references to these files that remain on your device.\n\nOn top of ensuring your device is encrypted, you will want to make sure that you've deleted your files from any trash folders as well. On iMessage, for instance, if you click on \"filters\" in the top left corner you'll find a \"recently deleted\" folder. Make sure you've cleared texts from there as well. On iPhones, once a file is deleted from both the main iMessage interface and the \"recently deleted\" file, it is permanently deleted, according to the company.\n\nCope suggests pre-emptively deleting some apps you don't want to be searched. This protective method is imperfect because an advanced search could reveal that an app was installed, but it would be a way to avoid having your WhatsApp messages searched, for instance, in the case of a manual search.\n\nDuring law enforcement searches inside the boundaries of the US, a cloud storage server is not more protected than your devices. At the border, however, there are currently policies in place that prohibit CBP from searching online cloud services. In practice, that means that immigration officers will have to put your phone in airplane mode before searching it.\n\n\"They do specifically say officers are only authorized to look at data that are 'resident on the device',\" Cope said. \"So that is data that is actually on the hard drive of your phone, laptop or camera. They're supposed to disconnect it from the internet, if it's an internet-connected device.\"\n\nIf you have data that you don't want to or can't delete permanently for any reason, you can delete it off your device and store it on your cloud storage like iCloud, Google Drive or Microsoft One Drive.\n\nThis is a high-level guide that may not touch on the specifics of your situation.

      "text": "IRS nears deal with Ice to share data of undocumented immigrants - report\n\nImmigration officials could give names and addresses to IRS amid concerns over Trump administration's abuse of power\n\nThe US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is reportedly nearing a deal to allow immigration officials to use tax data to support Donald Trump's deportation agenda, according to reports by the Washington Post.\n\nUnder the proposed data-sharing agreement, said to have been in negotiations for weeks, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) could hand over the names and addresses of undocumented immigrants to the IRS, raising concerns about abuse of power from the Trump administration and the erosion of privacy rights.\n\nIf access to this confidential database is agreed upon, it would mark a significant shift, likely becoming the first time immigration officials have relied on the tax system for enforcement assistance in such a sweeping way.\n\nUnder the agreement, the IRS would cross-reference names of undocumented immigrants with their confidential taxpayer databases, a move that would breach the longstanding trust in the confidentiality of tax information. Such data has historically been considered sensitive and thereby closely guarded, so the reported deal has raised alarm bells at the IRS, according to the Washington Post.\n\nThe IRS website says that undocumented immigrants \"are subject to US taxes despite their illegal status\", and because most are unable to get social security numbers, the agency allows them to file with individual taxpayer numbers, known as ITINs. The agency also subjects them to the same reporting and withholding obligations as it does to US citizens who receive the same kind of income. More than half of the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US file income tax returns to document their payments to the government.\n\nWhile the IRS mandates that taxpayer information is protected, section 6103 on the agency's website outlines that \"under court order, return information may be shared with law enforcement agencies for investigation and prosecution of non-tax criminal laws.\" However, sources familiar with the matter told the Washington Post that it would be rare for these privacy law exceptions to be weaponized for cooperation with immigration enforcement and that this was outside of standard procedure.\n\nThe potential shift in taxpayer data use, from once being used to rarely build criminal cases to now reportedly becoming instrumental in enforcing criminal penalties, aligns with many of the more aggressive immigration policies Trump is pursuing.\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump promised to deport millions of undocumented people in the US, and the reports of this new deal shine a light on how he is planning on doing so. Since becoming president, he has ended legal pathways for immigrants to come and stay in the US.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said on Friday they would revoke the temporary legal status of more than 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans, and Ice raids and enforcement operations have been commonplace in major cities across the US - like Chicago and New York - with high immigrant populations.\n\nAnd on Sunday, members of the Trump administration defended using the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, a wartime law, to deport the 137 Venezuelan migrants last weekend on the grounds that they were committing violent crimes and sending money back to Venezuela. The administration deported the migrants despite a judge's verbal orders telling them not to do so.\n\nThe so-called border czar, Tom Homan, said in an interview with ABC News that the administration would not defy court orders stemming from legal challenges over its invocation of the wartime Alien Enemies Act to deport the alleged Venezuelan gang members.\n\n\"I don't care what the judges think as far as this case,\" Homan told ABC, referring to a federal judge's efforts to determine whether the administration already ignored an earlier order to temporarily halt deportations.\n\nThe attorney general, Pam Bondi, also addressed the deportations in an interview with Fox News on Sunday, calling the fight against the alleged gang members was akin to \"modern-day warfare\"."

      "text": "Alarm as Florida Republicans move to fill deported workers' jobs with children: 'It's insane, right?'\n\nGovernor Ron DeSantis leads push to loosen child labor laws as immigration crackdown leads to workforce shortage\n\nBeneath the smugness of Ron DeSantis , at Florida leading the nation in immigration enforcement lies something of a conundrum: how to fill the essential jobs of the scores of immigrant workers targeted for deportation .\n\nThe answer, according to Florida lawmakers, is the state's schoolchildren, who as young as 14 could soon be allowed to work overnight shifts without a break - even on school nights.\n\nA bill that progressed this week through the Republican-dominated state senate seeks to remove numerous existing protections for teenage workers, and allow them, in the Florida governor's words, to step into the shoes of immigrants who supply Florida's tourism and agriculture industries with \"dirt cheap labor\".\n\n\"What's wrong with expecting our young people to be working part-time now? That's how it used to be when I was growing up,\" DeSantis said at an immigration forum with Donald Trump 's \"border czar\", Tom Homan, in Sarasota last week.\n\n\"Why do we say we need to import foreigners, even import them illegally, when teenagers used to work at these resorts, college students should be [doing] all this stuff.\"\n\nUnsurprisingly, the proposal has alarmed immigration advocates and watchdog groups concerned about child labor abuses and exploitation.\n\nThey point out that there is nothing \"part-time\" in the language of the companion senate and house bills currently before lawmakers, which instead will permit unlimited working hours without breaks for 14- and 15-year-olds who are schooled at home or online, and allow employers to require 16- and 17-year-olds to work for more than six days in a row.\n\n\"It's essentially treating teens who have developing bodies and minds like adults, and this will allow employers to schedule them for unlimited hours, overnight and without breaks, and this is during the school year,\" said Alexis Tsoukalas, senior policy analyst at the Florida Policy Institute (FPI), an independent research and economic analysis group.\n\n\"It's important to remind people that teens can work. They can get that experience and some extra money if they need it. But there have to be protections in place to protect our most vulnerable, and if we pass this that's absolutely not going to happen.\"\n\nMeanwhile, an attempt by the state senator who sponsored the bill, the Sarasota Republican Jay Collins, to paint it as an issue of parental rights rather than a way to cover Florida's deportation-driven labor shortfall also failed to impress critics.\n\n\"We're not talking about The Jungle by Upton Sinclair,\" he told the chamber on Wednesday, referring to the 1906 novel that described horrific and dangerous conditions endured by cheap immigrant laborers, including children, in Chicago's meat-packing industry - an environment that still exists today .\n\nDeSantis, he insisted, \"is talking about those soft skill benefits to children growing\", and said his bill was aimed at teenagers working in places like grocery stores.\n\nTsoukalas rejected Collins's claim. \"There's different arguments that people will put on the floor in order to do what they think it takes to get a bill passed. Given some of the justifications that state leaders have made in recent days, it's clear that they are linking the immigration issue and child labor,\" she said.\n\n\"When the sweeping anti-immigrant bill of 2023 passed, we did warn there would be impacts on the labor force and the economy given how reliant we are on immigrant labor. Of course, not all of those people are undocumented, but as we've seen recently at the federal level all types of people, even permanent residents, are getting threatened with deportation.\n\n\"Combined with what's going on at the state level, that absolutely is a concern. It's no surprise that last year, and then again this year, we're talking about the need to fill gaps with other forms of labor.\"\n\nAccording to the US Census Bureau, more than 27% of Florida's workforce is foreign-born.\n\nThe Farmworker Association of Florida, which represents tens of thousands of low-income, immigrant laborers, says about 60% of its membership is undocumented, and most vulnerable to detention and deportation. Others are among half a million Haitians nationwide who Trump has ordered to leave the US by August after he rescinded their temporary protected status .\n\nPushback from FPI and other groups persuaded Florida lawmakers to drop some of the harsher provisions in a child labor law that passed last year , and opponents are dismayed to find them back under consideration.\n\nSign up to Headlines US\n\nGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nThe state was singled out in a 2024 report by Governing for Impact and the Economic Policy Institute that recorded a surge in workplace injuries and violations involving minors - some in the agricultural industry where hazards include exposure to toxic chemicals and dangerous machinery.\n\nThe report noted a corresponding push in at least 30 mostly Republican-controlled states to weaken workplace protections for children, and warned the second Trump administration would seek to escalate the rollback .\n\n\"We've been saying since 2023 that this is a way for them to exploit minors, it was when they passed this large, anti-immigrant omnibus and the same year that they tried to pass the first law gutting child labor protection,\" said Thomas Kennedy, spokesperson for the Florida Immigrant Coalition.\n\n\"The only short-term answer to workforce shortages has always been net migration and they'll never go for that because of their politics. So their only answer is to widen the parameters of who can work, and you either go older or you go younger, and they chose to go younger.\"\n\nKennedy and Tsoukalas are hopeful that Republicans who said they were uncomfortable with some parts of the bill will ultimately decide to vote against it. According to the Miami Herald , the Republican state senators Nick DiCeglie and Tom Wright helped move it out of the commerce and tourism committee on a 5-4 vote, but said it \"needed work\".\n\nRepublican Joe Gruters joined three Democrats in voting against, saying: \"We need to let kids be kids.\"\n\nKennedy, however, pointed to another Republican bill that progressed this week that would allow employers to pay interns and apprentices less than minimum wage.\n\n\"To recap, they made the state hostile to immigrants. They deported a bunch of people, or scared people into not coming, or moving out of the state. They exacerbated worker shortages, so now they're trying to gut child labor protection standards, while at the same time passing a law that would allow them to classify these children and other workers as interns,\" he said.\n\n\"It's insane, right?\""

      "text": "I'm the Canadian who was detained by Ice for two weeks. It felt like I had been kidnapped\n\nI was stuck in a freezing cell without explanation despite eventually having lawyers and media attention. Yet, compared with others, I was lucky\n\nT here was no explanation, no warning. One minute, I was in an immigration office talking to an officer about my work visa, which had been approved months before and allowed me, a Canadian, to work in the US. The next, I was told to put my hands against the wall, and patted down like a criminal before being sent to an Ice detention center without the chance to talk to a lawyer.\n\nI grew up in Whitehorse, Yukon, a small town in the northernmost part of Canada . I always knew I wanted to do something bigger with my life. I left home early and moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, where I built a career spanning multiple industries - acting in film and television, owning bars and restaurants, flipping condos and managing Airbnbs.\n\nIn my 30s, I found my true passion working in the health and wellness industry. I was given the opportunity to help launch an American brand of health tonics called Holy! Water - a job that would involve moving to the US.\n\nI was granted my trade Nafta work visa, which allows Canadian and Mexican citizens to work in the US in specific professional occupations, on my second attempt. It goes without saying, then, that I have no criminal record. I also love the US and consider myself to be a kind, hard-working person.\n\nI started working in California and travelled back and forth between Canada and the US multiple times without any complications - until one day, upon returning to the US, a border officer questioned me about my initial visa denial and subsequent visa approval. He asked why I had gone to the San Diego border the second time to apply. I explained that that was where my lawyer's offices were, and that he had wanted to accompany me to ensure there were no issues.\n\nAfter a long interrogation, the officer told me it seemed \"shady\" and that my visa hadn't been properly processed. He claimed I also couldn't work for a company in the US that made use of hemp - one of the beverage ingredients. He revoked my visa, and told me I could still work for the company from Canada, but if I wanted to return to the US, I would need to reapply.\n\nI was devastated; I had just started building a life in California. I stayed in Canada for the next few months, and was eventually offered a similar position with a different health and wellness brand.\n\nI restarted the visa process and returned to the same immigration office at the San Diego border, since they had processed my visa before and I was familiar with it. Hours passed, with many confused opinions about my case. The officer I spoke to was kind but told me that, due to my previous issues, I needed to apply for my visa through the consulate. I told her I hadn't been aware I needed to apply that way, but had no problem doing it.\n\nThen she said something strange: \"You didn't do anything wrong. You are not in trouble, you are not a criminal.\"\n\nI remember thinking: Why would she say that? Of course I'm not a criminal!\n\nShe then told me they had to send me back to Canada. That didn't concern me; I assumed I would simply book a flight home. But as I sat searching for flights, a man approached me.\n\n\"Come with me,\" he said.\n\nThere was no explanation, no warning. He led me to a room, took my belongings from my hands and ordered me to put my hands against the wall. A woman immediately began patting me down. The commands came rapid-fire, one after another, too fast to process.\n\nThey took my shoes and pulled out my shoelaces.\n\n\"What are you doing? What is happening?\" I asked.\n\n\"You are being detained.\"\n\n\"I don't understand. What does that mean? For how long?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\nThat would be the response to nearly every question I would ask over the next two weeks: \"I don't know.\"\n\nThey brought me downstairs for a series of interviews and medical questions, searched my bags and told me I had to get rid of half my belongings because I couldn't take everything with me.\n\n\"Take everything with me where?\" I asked.\n\nA woman asked me for the name of someone they could contact on my behalf. In moments like this, you realize you don't actually know anyone's phone number anymore. By some miracle, I had recently memorized my best friend Britt's number because I had been putting my grocery points on her account.\n\nI gave them her phone number.\n\nThey handed me a mat and a folded-up sheet of aluminum foil.\n\n\"What is this?\"\n\n\"Your blanket.\"\n\n\"I don't understand.\"\n\nI was taken to a tiny, freezing cement cell with bright fluorescent lights and a toilet. There were five other women lying on their mats with the aluminum sheets wrapped over them, looking like dead bodies. The guard locked the door behind me.\n\nFor two days, we remained in that cell, only leaving briefly for food. The lights never turned off, we never knew what time it was and no one answered our questions. No one in the cell spoke English, so I either tried to sleep or meditate to keep from having a breakdown. I didn't trust the food, so I fasted, assuming I wouldn't be there long.\n\nOn the third day, I was finally allowed to make a phone call. I called Britt and told her that I didn't understand what was happening, that no one would tell me when I was going home, and that she was my only contact.\n\nThey gave me a stack of paperwork to sign and told me I was being given a five-year ban unless I applied for re-entry through the consulate. The officer also said it didn't matter whether I signed the papers or not; it was happening regardless.\n\nI was so delirious that I just signed. I told them I would pay for my flight home and asked when I could leave.\n\nNo answer.\n\nThen they moved me to another cell - this time with no mat or blanket. I sat on the freezing cement floor for hours. That's when I realized they were processing me into real jail: the Otay Mesa Detention Center.\n\nI was told to shower, given a jail uniform, fingerprinted and interviewed. I begged for information.\n\n\"How long will I be here?\"\n\n\"I don't know your case,\" the man said. \"Could be days. Could be weeks. But I'm telling you right now - you need to mentally prepare yourself for months.\"\n\nMonths.\n\nI felt like I was going to throw up.\n\nI was taken to the nurse's office for a medical check. She asked what had happened to me. She had never seen a Canadian there before. When I told her my story, she grabbed my hand and said: \"Do you believe in God?\"\n\nI told her I had only recently found God, but that I now believed in God more than anything.\n\n\"I believe God brought you here for a reason,\" she said. \"I know it feels like your life is in a million pieces, but you will be OK. Through this, I think you are going to find a way to help others.\"\n\nAt the time, I didn't know what that meant. She asked if she could pray for me. I held her hands and wept.\n\nI felt like I had been sent an angel.\n\nI was then placed in a real jail unit: two levels of cells surrounding a common area, just like in the movies. I was put in a tiny cell alone with a bunk bed and a toilet.\n\nThe best part: there were blankets. After three days without one, I wrapped myself in mine and finally felt some comfort.\n\nFor the first day, I didn't leave my cell. I continued fasting, terrified that the food might make me sick. The only available water came from the tap attached to the toilet in our cells or a sink in the common area, neither of which felt safe to drink.\n\nEventually, I forced myself to step out, meet the guards and learn the rules. One of them told me: \"No fighting.\"\n\n\"I'm a lover, not a fighter,\" I joked. He laughed.\n\nI asked if there had ever been a fight here.\n\n\"In this unit? No,\" he said. \"No one in this unit has a criminal record.\"\n\nThat's when I started meeting the other women.\n\nThat's when I started hearing their stories.\n\nAnd that's when I made a decision: I would never allow myself to feel sorry for my situation again. No matter how hard this was, I had to be grateful. Because every woman I met was in an even more difficult position than mine.\n\nThere were around 140 of us in our unit. Many women had lived and worked in the US legally for years but had overstayed their visas - often after reapplying and being denied. They had all been detained without warning.\n\nIf someone is a criminal, I agree they should be taken off the streets. But not one of these women had a criminal record. These women acknowledged that they shouldn't have overstayed and took responsibility for their actions. But their frustration wasn't about being held accountable; it was about the endless, bureaucratic limbo they had been trapped in.\n\nThe real issue was how long it took to get out of the system, with no clear answers, no timeline and no way to move forward. Once deported, many have no choice but to abandon everything they own because the cost of shipping their belongings back is too high.\n\nI met a woman who had been on a road trip with her husband. She said they had 10-year work visas. While driving near the San Diego border, they mistakenly got into a lane leading to Mexico. They stopped and told the agent they didn't have their passports on them, expecting to be redirected. Instead, they were detained. They are both pastors.\n\nI met a family of three who had been living in the US for 11 years with work authorizations. They paid taxes and were waiting for their green cards. Every year, the mother had to undergo a background check, but this time, she was told to bring her whole family. When they arrived, they were taken into custody and told their status would now be processed from within the detention center.\n\nAnother woman from Canada had been living in the US with her husband who was detained after a traffic stop. She admitted she had overstayed her visa and accepted that she would be deported. But she had been stuck in the system for almost six weeks because she hadn't had her passport. Who runs casual errands with their passport?\n\nOne woman had a 10-year visa. When it expired, she moved back to her home country, Venezuela. She admitted she had overstayed by one month before leaving. Later, she returned for a vacation and entered the US without issue. But when she took a domestic flight from Miami to Los Angeles, she was picked up by Ice and detained. She couldn't be deported because Venezuela wasn't accepting deportees. She didn't know when she was getting out.\n\nThere was a girl from India who had overstayed her student visa for three days before heading back home. She then came back to the US on a new, valid visa to finish her master's degree and was handed over to Ice due to the three days she had overstayed on her previous visa.\n\nThere were women who had been picked up off the street, from outside their workplaces, from their homes. All of these women told me that they had been detained for time spans ranging from a few weeks to 10 months. One woman's daughter was outside the detention center protesting for her release.\n\nThat night, the pastor invited me to a service she was holding. A girl who spoke English translated for me as the women took turns sharing their prayers - prayers for their sick parents, for the children they hadn't seen in weeks, for the loved ones they had been torn away from.\n\nThen, unexpectedly, they asked if they could pray for me. I was new here, and they wanted to welcome me. They formed a circle around me, took my hands and prayed. I had never felt so much love, energy and compassion from a group of strangers in my life. Everyone was crying.\n\nAt 3am the next day, I was woken up in my cell.\n\n\"Pack your bag. You're leaving.\"\n\nI jolted upright. \"I get to go home?\"\n\nThe officer shrugged. \"I don't know where you're going.\"\n\nOf course. No one ever knew anything.\n\nI grabbed my things and went downstairs, where 10 other women stood in silence, tears streaming down their faces. But these weren't happy tears. That was the moment I learned the term \"transferred\".\n\nFor many of these women, detention centers had become a twisted version of home. They had formed bonds, established routines and found slivers of comfort in the friendships they had built. Now, without warning, they were being torn apart and sent somewhere new. Watching them say goodbye, clinging to each other, was gut-wrenching.\n\nI had no idea what was waiting for me next. In hindsight, that was probably for the best.\n\nOur next stop was Arizona, the San Luis Regional Detention Center. The transfer process lasted 24 hours, a sleepless, grueling ordeal. This time, men were transported with us. Roughly 50 of us were crammed into a prison bus for the next five hours, packed together - women in the front, men in the back. We were bound in chains that wrapped tightly around our waists, with our cuffed hands secured to our bodies and shackles restraining our feet, forcing every movement into a slow, clinking struggle.\n\nWhen we arrived at our next destination, we were forced to go through the entire intake process all over again, with medical exams, fingerprinting - and pregnancy tests; they lined us up in a filthy cell, squatting over a communal toilet, holding Dixie cups of urine while the nurse dropped pregnancy tests in each of our cups. It was disgusting.\n\nWe sat in freezing-cold jail cells for hours, waiting for everyone to be processed. Across the room, one of the women suddenly spotted her husband. They had both been detained and were now seeing each other for the first time in weeks.\n\nThe look on her face - pure love, relief and longing - was something I'll never forget.\n\nWe were beyond exhausted. I felt like I was hallucinating.\n\nThe guard tossed us each a blanket: \"Find a bed.\"\n\nThere were no pillows. The room was ice cold, and one blanket wasn't enough. Around me, women lay curled into themselves, heads covered, looking like a room full of corpses. This place made the last jail feel like the Four Seasons.\n\nI kept telling myself: Do not let this break you.\n\nThirty of us shared one room. We were given one Styrofoam cup for water and one plastic spoon that we had to reuse for every meal. I eventually had to start trying to eat and, sure enough, I got sick. None of the uniforms fit, and everyone had men's shoes on. The towels they gave us to shower were hand towels. They wouldn't give us more blankets. The fluorescent lights shined on us 24/7.\n\nEverything felt like it was meant to break you. Nothing was explained to us. I wasn't given a phone call. We were locked in a room, no daylight, with no idea when we would get out.\n\nI tried to stay calm as every fiber of my being raged towards panic mode. I didn't know how I would tell Britt where I was. Then, as if sent from God, one of the women showed me a tablet attached to the wall where I could send emails. I only remembered my CEO's email from memory. I typed out a message, praying he would see it.\n\nHe responded.\n\nThrough him, I was able to connect with Britt. She told me that they were working around the clock trying to get me out. But no one had any answers; the system made it next to impossible. I told her about the conditions in this new place, and that was when we decided to go to the media.\n\nShe started working with a reporter and asked whether I would be able to call her so she could loop him in. The international phone account that Britt had previously tried to set up for me wasn't working, so one of the other women offered to let me use her phone account to make the call.\n\nWe were all in this together.\n\nWith nothing to do in my cell but talk, I made new friends - women who had risked everything for the chance at a better life for themselves and their families.\n\nThrough them, I learned the harsh reality of seeking asylum. Showing me their physical scars, they explained how they had paid smugglers anywhere from $20,000 to $60,000 to reach the US border, enduring brutal jungles and horrendous conditions.\n\nOne woman had been offered asylum in Mexico within two weeks but had been encouraged to keep going to the US. Now, she was stuck, living in a nightmare, separated from her young children for months. She sobbed, telling me how she felt like the worst mother in the world.\n\nMany of these women were highly educated and spoke multiple languages. Yet, they had been advised to pretend they didn't speak English because it would supposedly increase their chances of asylum.\n\nSome believed they were being used as examples, as warnings to others not to try to come.\n\nWomen were starting to panic in this new facility, and knowing I was most likely the first person to get out, they wrote letters and messages for me to send to their families.\n\nIt felt like we had all been kidnapped, thrown into some sort of sick psychological experiment meant to strip us of every ounce of strength and dignity.\n\nWe were from different countries, spoke different languages and practiced different religions. Yet, in this place, none of that mattered. Everyone took care of each other. Everyone shared food. Everyone held each other when someone broke down. Everyone fought to keep each other's hope alive.\n\nI got a message from Britt. My story had started to blow up in the media.\n\nAlmost immediately after, I was told I was being released.\n\nMy Ice agent, who had never spoken to me, told my lawyer I could have left sooner if I had signed a withdrawal form, and that they hadn't known I would pay for my own flight home.\n\nFrom the moment I arrived, I begged every officer I saw to let me pay for my own ticket home. Not a single one of them ever spoke to me about my case.\n\nTo put things into perspective: I had a Canadian passport, lawyers, resources, media attention, friends, family and even politicians advocating for me. Yet, I was still detained for nearly two weeks.\n\nImagine what this system is like for every other person in there.\n\nA small group of us were transferred back to San Diego at 2am - one last road trip, once again shackled in chains. I was then taken to the airport, where two officers were waiting for me. The media was there, so the officers snuck me in through a side door, trying to avoid anyone seeing me in restraints. I was beyond grateful that, at the very least, I didn't have to walk through the airport in chains.\n\nTo my surprise, the officers escorting me were incredibly kind, and even funny. It was the first time I had laughed in weeks.\n\nI asked if I could put my shoelaces back on.\n\n\"Yes,\" one of them said with a grin. \"But you better not run.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" the other added. \"Or we'll have to tackle you in the airport. That'll really make the headlines.\"\n\nI laughed, then told them I had spent a lot of time observing the guards during my detention and I couldn't believe how often I saw humans treating other humans with such disregard. \"But don't worry,\" I joked. \"You two get five stars.\"\n\nWhen I finally landed in Canada, my mom and two best friends were waiting for me. So was the media. I spoke to them briefly, numb and delusional from exhaustion.\n\nIt was surreal listening to my friends recount everything they had done to get me out: working with lawyers, reaching out to the media, making endless calls to detention centers, desperately trying to get through to Ice or anyone who could help. They said the entire system felt rigged, designed to make it nearly impossible for anyone to get out.\n\nThe reality became clear: Ice detention isn't just a bureaucratic nightmare. It's a business. These facilities are privately owned and run for profit.\n\nCompanies like CoreCivic and GEO Group receive government funding based on the number of people they detain, which is why they lobby for stricter immigration policies. It's a lucrative business : CoreCivic made over $560m from Ice contracts in a single year. In 2024, GEO Group made more than $763m from Ice contracts.\n\nThe more detainees, the more money they make. It stands to reason that these companies have no incentive to release people quickly. What I had experienced was finally starting to make sense.\n\nThis is not just my story. It is the story of thousands and thousands of people still trapped in a system that profits from their suffering. I am writing in the hope that someone out there - someone with the power to change any of this - can help do something.\n\nThe strength I witnessed in those women, the love they gave despite their suffering, is what gives me faith. Faith that no matter how flawed the system, how cruel the circumstances, humanity will always shine through.\n\nEven in the darkest places, within the most broken systems, humanity persists. Sometimes, it reveals itself in the smallest, most unexpected acts of kindness: a shared meal, a whispered prayer, a hand reaching out in the dark. We are defined by the love we extend, the courage we summon and the truths we are willing to tell.\n\nThis article was amended on 18 April 2025 to remove an image which had been manipulated in breach of editorial standards."

      "text": "'Dagger through the heart': outcry as Ice detains University of Alabama student\n\nJustification for arrest not clear as Trump administration increasingly targets students for arrest and deportation\n\nThere was an outcry on campus at the University of Alabama on Thursday after US immigration authorities detained a doctoral student - an event which campus officials confirmed on Wednesday.\n\nA spokesperson for the state's flagship university said in a brief statement that a student was arrested \"off campus\" by federal immigration officials, but declined to comment further, citing privacy laws.\n\nThe US government's justification for detaining the student was not immediately clear, and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) did not respond to a request for comment late on Wednesday.\n\nNews of the arrest comes amid reports of the Trump administration increasingly targeting college students for arrest and deportation across the country, including people in the US on visas and permanent residents with green cards, raising alarms on campuses and in surrounding communities.\n\nThe Crimson White, a student newspaper at the University of Alabama, reported on the arrest , saying the targeted student was detained at their home early on Tuesday morning. The individual is Iranian and was in the US on a student visa and studying mechanical engineering, the newspaper said, identifying the student as Alireza Doroudi. The university's College Democrats group said in a statement that Trump and Ice \"have struck a cold, vicious dagger through the heart of UA's international community\".\n\n\"Our fears have come to pass. Donald Trump, Tom Homan, and Ice have struck a cold, vicious dagger through the heart of UA's international community,\" the group said. Homan, previously Ice's acting director, is Trump's newest so-called \"border czar\".\n\n\"As far as we know right now, Ice is yet to provide any justification for their actions, so we are not sure if this persecution is politically motivated, as has been seen in other universities across the country. Regardless, our mission to advocate for all corners of the UA community is ironclad, and forever will be,\" the group added.\n\nIt was not immediately clear on Wednesday evening if the arrested student had a lawyer.\n\nAlex House, a university spokesperson, said its international student and scholar services center was available to assist students with concerns: \"International students studying at the university are valued members of the campus community.\"\n\nBut House's statement added that the university \"has and will continue to follow all immigration laws and cooperate with federal authorities\".\n\nThe National Iranian American Council (NIAC) also condemned the student's detention on Thursday, saying : \"We are deeply disturbed by the arrest of Alireza Doroudi, a doctoral student at the University of Alabama, by Ice agents. At a minimum, Ice must make his whereabouts known and make clear if he has been charged with any crime. If not, he should be immediately released.\n\n\"The cruelty appears to have been the point of these harsh arrests, spreading fear in many communities. We call on the administration to halt these harsh and unjust actions and immediately release all those unjustly detained,\" NIAC added.\n\nThe Alabama arrest was confirmed the same day news broke that Rumeysa Ozturk, a doctoral student at Tufts University in Boston, was detained by federal immigration agents and taken to an Ice detention center in Louisiana. Her arrest appeared to be part of the US government's crackdown on students with ties to pro-Palestinian activism on campus last year.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said Ozturk was in the US on a visa and accused her of supporting Hamas, but did not provide evidence to support its claims. Media reports noted that Ozturk, a Fulbright scholar and Turkish citizen, had in March 2024 co-written an opinion piece in the Tufts student newspaper, alongside three other authors, supporting calls for the university to \"acknowledge the Palestinian genocide\".\n\nSign up to Headlines US\n\nGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nOzturk's arrest has sparked widespread outrage as video circulated showing masked officers, in plainclothes, approaching her on the street and taking her into custody. A 32-year-old software engineer whose surveillance camera recorded the arrest told the Associated Press it \"looked like a kidnapping\".\n\nThe Massachusetts director of Council on American-Islamic Relations, the Muslim civil rights group, said in a statement: \"We unequivocally condemn the abduction of a young Muslim hijab-wearing scholar by masked federal agents in broad daylight. This alarming act of repression is a direct assault on free speech and academic freedom.\"\n\nOzturk's lawyer told the New York Times she was heading out to break her Ramadan fast with friends when she was detained near her apartment.\n\nTufts's president said the university \"had no pre-knowledge of this incident and did not share any information with federal authorities prior to the event\". The university was told the student's visa was \"terminated\", the president added.\n\nIce records suggested Ozturk was taken to Louisiana despite a judge ordering DHS to give advanced notice if officials sought to transfer her out of state.\n\nDHS has also faced scrutiny over its efforts to deport Mahmoud Khalil , a Palestinian activist and recent Columbia graduate, who is a green card holder. A US judge in Manhattan on Wednesday blocked immigration officials from detaining Yunseo Chung , a Columbia undergraduate, who is also a permanent resident facing threats of deportation for involvement in Gaza solidarity protests.\n\nMaya Yang contributed reporting"

      "text": "Here's what you need to know about your rights when entering the US\n\nTrump's hardline immigration policy is sweeping up even visa and green-card holders into detention centers\n\nSince Donald Trump returned to the White House, he has carried out the hardline immigration policies he promised on the campaign trail.\n\nTrump's administration sent immigrants to the Guantánamo Bay naval base in Cuba - with little access to legal counsel - and singled out two pro-Palestinian academics for deportation. The administration also failed to return El Salvador-destined deportation flights in potential violation of a court order .\n\nBut in recent weeks, immigration authorities have also repeatedly detained US-bound tourists at the border, sparking public and diplomatic outrage abroad and fears among many people planning trips to the US, or living in the country on visas.\n\nExamples have made global headlines. A British woman said that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detained her for three weeks after a mixup at the US-Canada border. Canadian businesswoman and actor Jasmine Mooney said she was detained by Ice for two weeks. Jessica Brösche, a 29-year-old tattoo artist from Germany, was held in immigration detention for six weeks before returning home.\n\nThere's suspicion that in some cases people were turned away over anti-Trump views. Among them is a French scientist who was denied entry after immigration officers at an airport found messages on his phone that were critical of Trump, France's minister of higher education said .\n\nWith serious concerns growing about whether visitors can safely travel to the US without fear of landing in immigration detention, here is a brief guide to international visitors' rights.\n\nYes. US customs officers can stop people at entry points to assess whether they can come into the US. They are permitted to search travelers' belongings for contraband, according to the ACLU of Pennsylvania .\n\nThey can do this even if there's nothing suspicious about you or your belongings. Customs agents are not allowed to search you or conduct another inspection \"based on your religion, race, national origin, gender, ethnicity or political beliefs\".\n\nThe government asserts that their authority to search travelers without individualized suspicion also includes searches of electronic devices, including cellphones and laptops. That said, this assertion remains \"a contested legal issue\", the ACLU said. Customs officers have at times asked travelers to give them their phone or laptop passwords when they were going to or from the US.\n\nCitizens of the US can't be denied entry if they refuse to provide passwords or unlock their devices. However, if they refuse, it could prompt a delay, still more questioning and customs officers taking their phone for further inspection.\n\nThis should also be true for US lawful permanent residents who have been admitted to the US before and maintain their immigration status, as their green cards \"can't be revoked without a hearing before an immigration judge\". For visa holders and travelers from visa waiver countries, they are at risk of being denied entry if they refuse to unlock devices, the ACLU said.\n\nIn general, the visa waiver program allows citizens of about four dozen countries to enter for up to 90 days without a visa for tourism or business. Citizens of the US, in turn, can travel up to 90 days in program countries.\n\nHowever, travelers from waiver program countries still need valid Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) approval before they come here for at least 72 hours prior to getting on a flight, the New York Times explains .\n\nThe tricky part is that you can't get an ESTA if you traveled to certain places after specified times, such as Cuba after 12 January 2021, the Times said. Without an ESTA, a tourist visa is necessary.\n\nVisitors coming to the US with an ESTA are prohibited from studying or engaging in permanent work. ESTA visitors also give up many rights, such as the right to fight deportation - meaning that persons traveling with an ESTA could wind up facing \"mandatory detention\", the Times said.\n\nThere are three types of visas for non-immigrant visitors to the US. There is a visitor visa allowing temporary entry for business purposes, a tourism visa, and a visa for business and travel.\n\nThe three visas last as long as a decade but visitors with these visas can stay a maximum of six months in the US. Among other things, visitors with these visas are not allowed to do permanent work or study, or engage in paid performances, according to the New York Times.\n\nEven if your documents are in order, that doesn't guarantee admission into the US. According to the Department of State , customs officials \"have authority to permit or deny admission to the United States\".\n\nCivil rights advocates now suggest that visitors into the US, especially people who are not citizens, bring information to call an immigration lawyer or emergency contact if they encounter problems. \"The stories are definitely concerning,\" Noor Zafar, senior staff attorney with the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, told the Washington Post.\n\nZafar reportedly said that if travelers are detained, it's advisable to comply with immigration officers' directions- and get in touch with a lawyer immediately.\n\nVisitors to the US do have the right to remain silent. But choosing to do so at an entry point could jeopardize entry.\n\nIf a customs agent asks a visitor with a tourist visa whether they were going to work during their stay, and that person doesn't answer, then it could result in their being denied entry.\n\nIf a visitor is not allowed to enter the US, they can \"withdraw\" their intent to do so and be permitted to return home. Typically their visa gets canceled and they fly back right away.\n\nAn officer could deny this withdrawal, however, and detain the visitor. That is because these encounters technically take place outside the US and constitutional protections don't hold. As a result, detainees in this situation don't automatically have the right to an attorney.\n\n\"If you're a foreign national, first understand you haven't affected an entry despite being physically on US soil until you're admitted properly,\" said immigration attorney Michael Wildes, managing partner of Wildes and Weinberg and a professor at the Cardozo School of Law.\n\n\"It's a term of art when you're admitted fully to the United States,\" he said. When a person lands on US soil but is not technically admitted, \"you might be considered to be what's called an 'arriving alien'.\n\n\"You have greater rights as a criminal than as a foreign national coming with a visa.\""

      "text": "US tourism industry faces drop-off as immigration agenda deters travellers\n\nWesterners increasingly hesitant to travel to US out of fear of arrests and detentions as Trump enforces crackdown\n\nA string of high-profile arrests and detentions of travellers is likely to cause a major downturn in tourism to the US, with latest figures already showing a serious drop-off, tourist experts said.\n\nSeveral western travellers have recently been rejected at the US border on increasingly flimsy grounds under Donald Trump 's immigration crackdown, some of them shackled and held in detention centers in poor conditions for weeks .\n\nGermany updated travel guidance for travelling to the US, warning that breaking entry rules could lead not just to a rejection as before, but arrest or even detention. Three German citizens have been held for prolonged periods despite apparently having committed no crime nor any obvious violation of US visa or immigration rules - including one US green card holder who was detained at Boston's Logan airport.\n\nThe UK Foreign Office, too, has bolstered its advice to warn of a risk of arrest after Becky Burke, a tourist from Wales who had been backpacking across America, was stopped at the border with Canada and held for three weeks in a detention facility. Last week members of the UK Subs, a British punk band, were denied entry and detained after they landed at Los Angeles international airport.\n\nEven before the most recent spate of detentions, forecast visits to the country this year had been revised downward from a projected 5% rise to a 9% decrease by Tourism Economics, an industry monitoring group, which cited \"polarising Trump Administration policies and rhetoric\", particularly around tariffs.\n\nIt predicted that the drop-off would lead to a $64bn shortfall in the US tourist trade.\n\n\"There's been a dramatic shift in our outlook,\" said Adam Sacks, the president of Tourism Economics, told the Washington Post . \"You're looking at a much weaker economic engine than what otherwise would've been, not just because of tariffs, but the rhetoric and condescending tone around it.\"\n\nThe decline has been most pronounced from neighbouring Canada, which Trump has menaced with crippling tariffs and repeatedly threatened to annex outright. The number of Canadians returning by road from the US fell by 23% in February, year on year, while air traffic fell 13% on a year earlier, according to Canadian government statistics.\n\nA Canadian actor made headlines this week when she revealed US authorities had handcuffed her and moved her out of state to a detention center, where she spent several weeks in \"inhumane conditions\" despite not having been accused of any crime.\n\nNeri Karra Sillaman, an entrepreneurship expert at Oxford University, told Fast Company that travellers now viewed entering the US as \"too difficult or unpredictable\".\n\n\"Even if you get a visa, you have the risk of being detained or to be denied,\" she said, adding that even as a valid US visa holder, married to an American, she was hesitating to visit the country in the current climate.\n\nThat climate was in further evidence this week as Denmark and Finland issued cautionary advice to transgender travellers, following US state department rule changes spurred by the Trump administration decree that it would recognise only two genders . The Danish foreign ministry advised travellers who use the gender designation \"X\" on their passport to contact the US embassy before travelling, while Finland cautioned travellers whose gender had changed that they might not gain entry.\n\nThe recent episodes are all the more striking because they involve countries long allied to the US, although students and academics from India and the Middle East have also been detained in recent days despite holding valid visas. While visitors from many regions have long had difficulty entering the US, immigration officials have traditionally taken a more lenient stance towards travellers from allied nations.\n\nPedro Rios, the director of the American Friends Service Committee, a non-profit group that aids migrants, told AP that it was unprecedented in the 22 years he had worked at the southern border for travellers from western Europe and Canada to be detained with such regularity.\n\n\"It's definitely unusual with these cases so close together, and the rationale for detaining these people doesn't make sense,\" he said. \"The only reason I see is there is a much more fervent anti-immigrant atmosphere.\""

I think that this administration is trying to chip away at that notion, but that is very much what First Amendment jurisprudence has been under the courts.\"\n\nCAIR's McCaw said he worried that the policy could be used to continue tracking people's activity on social media even after they become naturalized citizens.\n\n\"There's no clear sign on when this intrusion into our electronics and communications will end,\" he said.\n\nThe government is collecting comments on the proposed policy until May 5.\n\nWAIT!

Those who criticize the agency could be pulled into the dragnet.\n\nAmid anger and protest over the Trump administration's plan to deport millions of immigrants, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement plans to monitor and locate \"negative\" social media discussion about the agency and its top officials, according to contract documents reviewed by The Intercept.\n\nCiting an increase in threats to ICE agents and leadership, the agency is soliciting pitches from private companies to monitor threats across the internet - with a special focus on social media. People who simply criticize ICE online could pulled into the dragnet.\n\n\"In order to prevent adversaries from successfully targeting ICE Senior leaders, personnel and facilities, ICE requires real-time threat mitigation and monitoring services, vulnerability assessments, and proactive threat monitoring services,\" the procurement document reads.\n\nIf this scanning uncovers anything the agency deems suspicious, ICE is asking its contractors to drill down into the background of social media users.\n\nThat includes:\n\n\"Previous social media activity which would indicate any additional threats to ICE; 2). Information which would indicate the individual(s) and/or the organization(s) making threats have a proclivity for violence; and 3). Information indicating a potential for carrying out a threat (such as postings depicting weapons, acts of violence, refences to acts of violence, to include empathy or affiliation with a group which has violent tendencies; references to violent acts; affections with violent acts; eluding [sic] to violent acts.\"\n\nIt's unclear how exactly any contractor might sniff out someone's \"proclivity for violence.\" The ICE document states only that the contractor will use \"social and behavioral sciences\" and \"psychological profiles\" to accomplish its automated threat detection.\n\nOnce flagged, the system will further scour a target's internet history and attempt to reveal their real-world position and offline identity. In addition to compiling personal information - such as the Social Security numbers and addresses of those whose posts are flagged - the contractor will also provide ICE with a \"photograph, partial legal name, partial date of birth, possible city, possible work affiliations, possible school or university affiliation, and any identified possible family members or associates.\"\n\nThe document also requests \"Facial Recognition capabilities that could take a photograph of a subject and search the internet to find all relevant information associated with the subject.\" The contract contains specific directions for targets found in other countries, implying the program would scan the domestic speech of American citizens. Read Our Complete Coverage The War on Immigrants\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nThe posting indicates that ICE isn't merely looking to detect direct threats of violence, but also online criticism of the agency.\n\nAs part of its mission to protect ICE with \"proactive threat monitoring,\" the winning contractor will not simply flag threatening remarks but \"Provide monitoring and analysis of behavioral and social media sentiment (i.e. positive, neutral, and negative).\" This includes regular updates on the \"total number of negative references to ICE found in social media\" from week to week.\n\n\"ICE's attempt to have eyes and ears in as many places as we exist both online and offline should ring an alarm.\"\n\nSuch sentiment analysis - typically accomplished via machine-learning techniques - could place under law enforcement scrutiny speech that is constitutionally protected. Simply stated, a post that is critical or even hostile to ICE isn't against the law.\n\n\"ICE's attempts to capture and assign a judgement to people's 'sentiment' throughout the expanse of the internet is beyond concerning,\" said Cinthya Rodriguez, an organizer with the immigrant rights group Mijente. \"The current administration's attempt to use this technology falls within the agency's larger history of mass surveillance, which includes gathering information from personal social media accounts and retaliating against immigrant activists. ICE's attempt to have eyes and ears in as many places as we exist both online and offline should ring an alarm for all of us.\"\n\nScanning online speech in the name of homeland security is a bipartisan initiative. The document soliciting contractors appears nearly identical to a procurement document published by ICE in 2020, which resulted in a $5.5 million contract between the agency and Barbaricum, a Washington-based defense and intelligence contractor. A new contract has not yet been awarded. ICE spokesperson Jocelyn Biggs told The Intercept, \"While ICE anticipates maintaining its threat risk monitoring services, we cannot speculate on a specific timeline for future contract decisions.\"\n\nOriginal reporting.

The goal of this contract, ostensibly, is focused more narrowly on threats to ICE leadership, agents, facilities, and operations.\n\nCivil liberties advocates told The Intercept the program had grave speech implications under the current administration. \"While surveillance programs like this under any administration are a concerning privacy and free speech violation and I would fight to stop them, the rhetoric of the Trump administration makes this practice especially terrifying,\" said Calli Schroeder, senior counsel at the Electronic Privacy Information Center. \"Threats to 'punish' opponents or deport those exercising 1st Amendment rights combine with these invasive practices to create a real 'thought police' scenario.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "The Immigration Policy Spiral\n\nJoe Biden, from a position of weakness, is trying to cut a punitive deal on border policy without the House.\n\nby David Dayen\n\nDecember 15, 2023\n\n11:00 AM\n\nRoss D. Franklin/AP Photo\n\nMigrants are loaded onto shuttle buses as hundreds gather along the border, December 5, 2023, in Lukeville, Arizona. The U.S. Border Patrol says it is overwhelmed by a shift in human smuggling routes, with hundreds of migrants from faraway countries like Senegal, Bangladesh, and China being dropped in the remote desert area in Arizona.\n\nIn 2006, senators and the White House worked tirelessly on a comprehensive immigration reform deal, which allowed for a path to citizenship for undocumented people. It passed with 62 votes, but the Republican House didn't want any part of it. The deal never became law.\n\nIn 2013, senators and the White House worked tirelessly on a comprehensive immigration reform deal, which allowed for a path to citizenship for undocumented people after a period of 13 years. It passed with 68 votes, but the Republican House didn't want any part of it. The deal never became law.\n\nIn 2023, senators and the White House are working tirelessly on an immigration package that is not at all comprehensive, offers no path to citizenship, and is mainly about locking up the border to asylum seekers and migrants, not substantially different from policies Donald Trump and Stephen Miller favor. The Republican House leadership says they don't want any part of it, and they've left town for the year.\n\nMore from David Dayen\n\nThis rather desperate attempt from the Biden administration to secure a border deal in exchange for military aid to Ukraine seems destined to end the way all immigration deals of recent vintage end, because hard-line conservatives prefer having an \"open border\" as an issue, especially under a Democratic president. However, the last two decades of House GOP stonewalling have worked to contour these deals so that they are now purely restrictionist.\n\nThis is in part a function of a Democratic leadership that has given up making any kind of argument about how the country benefits from migrants. That has helped mold public opinion to think about immigration only as a problem to be solved. And it's led us down this policy spiral, one that a potential Trump second term would sink even further.\n\nJOE BIDEN'S PRIORITY IN OFFICE ON IMMIGRATION has been simply to reduce the perception of chaos at the border. This was attempted through an initial flurry of deportations, extended use of Title 42 public-health expulsions during the pandemic, and warnings to migrants not to show up. None of this worked to stem a growing international tide of displacement, especially as the pandemic dissipated and people could more easily leave their home countries.\n\nWhen Title 42 ended this year, Biden's team tried to use an app to schedule appointments for asylum claims, keeping migrants out of the country. They barred migrants from seeking asylum if they didn't seek it in countries they passed through along the way. Or they used \"humanitarian parole\" to move a small number of migrants into the U.S. interior. None of this worked easier. However painful, harsh, or arduous the situation at the border, it has clearly not felt to asylum seekers materially worse the risk of violence, political unrest, economic collapse, or climate disaster at home.\n\nAccordingly, the attempt to shape perceptions has failed dramatically. Polling out this week shows that the public believes Biden to be too liberal on immigration, and that the system is out of control. Moreover, the parole policies only shifted focus from the border to blue cities, whose residents and leaders have become fed up with the steady stream of asylum seekers, and blame the president.\n\nThis could lead one to believe that the politics are ripe for Biden to make a border deal. But that's only if you believe there is some agreed-upon reality about the border for both sides of this issue. It's not hard for right-wing news media to present a border out of control if it damages their political opponent; remember the \"migrant caravans\" that only pop up within the months before a national election? That's not going to magically stop, even if a deal gets made. When presented with a relentless narrative of bedlam fueled by bad policies, and a president who never makes the case for anything else, what are people supposed to think?\n\nA LITTLE OVER A WEEK AGO, BORDER DEAL TALKS were collapsing , for obvious reasons: You really can't lock in policy details contested for years in the space of a few weeks. The cynic would say the whole setup was deliberately impossible. Conservatives have rebelled against Ukraine aid over the last year, and proposing a ludicrously high bar as the condition for success gave them the ability to blame Democrats when it inevitably didn't work out. This may be why House Speaker Mike Johnson has consistently said that he would accept nothing less than H.R. 2, the party-line conservative border policy, if Ukraine aid were going to move.\n\nBut it's important to note that Biden initially tied immigration and Ukraine together, by adding border security funding in the original supplemental request as a sweetener for skeptical conservatives. He put himself in his own box, and Republicans pounced.\n\nAs talks flailed, Mitch McConnell, who sees Ukraine as part of his personal legacy , announced that the only way anything would happen on the border-for-Ukraine swap is if Biden got personally involved . McConnell is someone with personal experience fleecing Biden in moments of weakness, dating back to the 2012 fiscal cliff. And because Biden both believes Ukraine is the leading foreign-policy challenge of his presidency, and hopes against hope to take the border issue \"off the table\" in the next election, he was eager to engage, from a position of weakness.\n\nThe cynic would say the whole setup was deliberately impossible.\n\nBiden sent his chief of staff Jeff Zients and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas into the talks, and made a series of concessions . One allows for unilateral expulsions without asylum screenings, a reversion to the Title 42 expulsion policy that was lifted when the pandemic emergency expired, on days with a high number of border crossings. (How this would not violate international law is unstated.) In addition, Biden has offered tightened \"credible fear\" standards for granting asylum, mandated detention for some migrants pending a court hearing (it's anyone's guess where they would be held, as there is already a shortage of beds), and expansion of expedited removal to deport migrants anywhere in the country who fail an asylum screening. As Dara Lind of the American Immigration Council explains , if that ever passed it would be a nice tool for Stephen Miller's dreams of mass deportation.\n\nThe offer has made some Democratic lawmakers , commentators , and immigrant rights groups apoplectic. It devolves the deal-making from \"comprehensive immigration reform\" to a border crackdown, with no new path to legal standing in the U.S. for any migrant. I'm not sure Latino voters, whose top issues are inflation and jobs and whom Biden is messaging to by likening Trump to Latin American dictators , will see this as a betrayal, but the people who volunteer and knock on doors for Biden might.\n\nBut most important, while the deal would certainly make it harder for migrants to get into the country, it's hard to say that it would stop so many from trying. That's because every change at the border over the past three years has led to a temporary drop in crossings, followed by a surge . This is an infrastructure problem, and a global displacement problem, rather than a \"CBP is not being mean enough\" problem.\n\nSenate Republicans are cagily \" weighing \" Biden's offer, but House Republicans haven't budged from their even more punitive H.R. 2 demand , which includes resuming border wall construction, requiring all migrants to remain in Mexico for processing, and more. This hasn't stopped Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer from calling for votes on Monday on a deal that isn't in writing, hasn't been agreed to, and has no guarantee (or even the semblance of a guarantee) of success in the House. Having attempted to work around House Republicans for 17 years and trying to jam them with an agreement after the fact, with no real success, Biden and the Democrats are going to that well once again. Combine that with the 100 or so hard no votes in the House GOP on Ukraine funding no matter what's attached, and it's difficult to understand why we're having this conversation.\n\nSo Biden is either angering his own base for no reason, or putting together a deal that finally gets congressional sign-off that won't work, and that certainly won't be shown on Fox News to be working. I'd almost understand the former, if I thought Biden's team were entering talks knowing that they won't pass. I think they're genuine in wanting a solution; certainly they want that funding for Ukraine.\n\nImmigration policy is a political liability for Biden. But it's a liability of his own making, born of a failure to make an argument in public and sell any vision for why immigrants, who built America, still help America. Instead, like several presidents before him, he's running in circles to cut a deal, in a way that seemingly guarantees defeat. And the deals keep getting worse.\n\nDavid Dayen is the Prospect's executive editor.

      "text": "ICE Is Erasing Rules That Protected Trans Immigrants\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nRecords reviewed by The Intercept show that ICE altered contracts with immigration detention centers to cut transgender care requirements.\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement is quietly deleting rules for how contractors treat transgender people in immigration detention, endangering a vulnerable population that often faces abuse and sexual assault behind bars.\n\nOver the last month, ICE has altered contracts for at least two detention centers, in Florida and New York, to remove transgender care requirements, according to records reviewed by The Intercept.\n\nThose changes followed President Donald Trump's anti-trans executive order targeting \"gender ideology extremism.\"\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security office charged with investigating civil rights violations in immigration detention has cited the same executive order to close at least one complaint based on gender identity discrimination, according to an immigrant rights group.\n\nThe government's shifts could deny trans people some of the few tools available for protecting themselves in detention, advocates said.\n\n\"While this is not unexpected, it is still incredibly alarming, because the mistreatment of transgender people in immigration detention has been so horrible for so long, and it has been so difficult to combat that mistreatment,\" said Bridget Crawford, the director of law and policy for the nonprofit group Immigration Equality. \"There are so few mechanisms by which you can guarantee any modicum of protection or medically competent care, and now they are removing even those limited protections.\"\n\nThe records show ICE altered transgender care requirements for at least two facilities soon after Trump's January 20 executive order, although the contract amendments do not specifically reference it.\n\nIn February, the agency changed its contract with Akima Global Services, which has a management contract for the ICE-owned Buffalo Service Processing Center in New York. The contract was modified to \"rescind/remove all Transgender Care requirements,\" according to an entry in the Federal Procurement Data System.\n\nEarlier this month, the agency dropped similar language from its contract with the GEO Group, a publicly traded private-prison company that has cheered Trump's immigration crackdown , covering detainees at the Broward Transitional Center in Florida.\n\nAlso in March, the agency uploaded to its website an undated amendment to its intergovernmental services agreement with the Calhoun County Sheriff's Office in Battle Creek, Michigan, to delete transgender care requirements for immigration detainees in its jail.\n\nGEO Group and Calhoun County referred requests for comment to ICE. Akima did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nICE did not respond to questions - including about what motivated the contract changes or which care requirements they are dropping.\n\nOne immigration lawyer said that while she had long viewed ICE's standards as ineffective due to a lack of enforcement, dropping them still sends a chilling message.\n\n\"Even if there isn't a huge amount of language that they are actually stripping from the contract itself, the message is the same. That the lives of people who are trans in that detention center are not valued and that abuse can be carried out with impunity,\" said Ann Garcia, a staff attorney at the National Immigration Project.\n\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union of Michigan staff attorney Jay Kaplan said his group would closely monitor conditions at the lock-up in Battle Creek, noting that the Constitution and state law also provide protections for transgender people.\n\n\"If it is pursuant to some executive order, an executive order doesn't usurp federal court decisions. It doesn't usurp parts of the Constitution,\" Kaplan said.\n\nTrump, in his executive order, mandated that detained trans women be placed in housing with men and ordered federal agencies to \"remove all statements, policies, regulations, forms, communications, or other internal and external messages that promote or otherwise inculcate gender ideology.\"\n\nThat represents a sharp about-face from the Biden era, when ICE added extensive \"transgender care\" language to contracts with numerous vendors.\n\nThat language often extended far beyond medical care. Sample contract language included with a detention contract in Colorado shows that facilities were required to hold newly detained trans people away from the general population, for no more than 72 hours, until a special committee could decide where best to house them.\n\nThe language required the facilities to at least consider placing the detainee in \"general housing consistent with the non-citizen's gender identity.\"\n\nIt also required the facilities to consider special safety measures, provide appropriate clothing and hygiene products, conduct strip-searches in private, refer to detainees by their preferred pronouns, and have access to \"transgender-related health care based on medical need.\"\n\nMoreover, the committees considering the transgender detainee's conditions were supposed to regularly reconvene and review reports of mistreatment. Read Our Complete Coverage The War on Immigrants\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nThe sample contract reflects a memo issued by Trump border czar Tom Homan during an earlier part of his career in 2015 , when he was executive assistant director of ICE's Office of Enforcement and Removal Operations under Barack Obama.\n\nThat memo laid out protections for trans people in custody, including the committees, and stated that \"Discrimination or harassment of any kind based on a detainee's actual or perceived sexual orientation or gender identity is strictly prohibited.\"\n\nThe memo vanished in February from its long-standing address on ICE's website, according to Internet Archive captures. ICE did not comment on whether it remains effective.\n\nTransgender people make up a tiny fraction of those in immigration custody - perhaps a few dozen on any given day. But there have been long-standing reports of physical and sexual assault , prolonged solitary confinement , verbal abuse from staff and fellow detainees, and the denial of medical care such as HIV medication and hormone therapy.\n\nImmigration Equality and other groups issued a report last June , based on interviews with 41 people who are LGBTQ or living with HIV, calling for the government to phase out immigration detention entirely.\n\nOriginal reporting.

Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nWhile many advocates saw Homan's 2015 memo as imperfect, they said that at the very least it should be included in binding contracts with the corporations and local governments that own or operate detention facilities for profit . The Biden administration amended numerous contracts in 2022 and 2023.\n\nHoman's memo, and the contract language, provided detainees with something to point to when they filed complaints with the Department of Homeland Security's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, attorneys said.\n\nThat office was charged with investigating complaints about civil rights violations, including those related to gender orientation.\n\nHowever, Immigration Equality says the office recently closed a case related to gender identity discrimination by citing Trump's executive order.\n\nThat raised the disturbing possibility that the agency will no longer investigate complaints based on gender identity discrimination, Immigration Equality lawyer Liza Doubossarskaia said.\n\nDHS did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nEven if DHS policy has not changed to prevent trans people from lodging discrimination complaints, there may be no one around to investigate them. Last week, DHS said it would be reducing staff in the civil rights office to a bare minimum .\n\n\"There isn't anyone to complain to who can take meaningful action right now,\" Doubossarskaia said. \"It's scary.

      "text": "Harris Ran to Trump's Right on Immigration - and Gained Absolutely Nothing For It\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nHarris could have focused on how U.S. foreign policy pushes immigrants to leave their homes. Instead, she ran on border security.\n\nJust six weeks after Joe Biden's inauguration, 80 House Democrats urged the newly sworn-in president to immediately renew diplomatic engagement with Cuba and end the \"cruel\" sanctions imposed by the Trump administration.\n\nThe letter encouraged Biden to end the blockade and take executive action to reverse Trump's policies.\n\nBiden ignored the plea. Not long after the letter was sent, a White House official told Reuters that a quick Cuba policy shift was not a top priority.\n\nThe decadeslong U.S. embargo against Cuba rolled on, hitting the Cuban people first and foremost. During the pandemic, this sanctions regime led to severe food and medical shortages on the island. People left in droves.\n\nSince 2020, Cuba has seen the largest exodus in its entire history. Over 1 million people left between 2022 and 2023 alone as a result of the economic crisis.\n\nAnd they came to the U.S.\n\nCuba became one facet of an immigration debate in the U.S. that took a central role in the presidential election.\n\nDonald Trump railed against immigrants , presenting them as a threat to a supposed American way of life. Kamala Harris, for her part, embraced this same narrative , if not the rhetoric, and yet had nothing to show for it on Wednesday morning.\n\nIt was an unsupportable, immoral, and unpopular position. And Harris gained nothing.\n\nIt was a typical Democratic folly: the wrong position that is also bad politics. There was a way out of the race to the bottom in the immigration debate - and there still is. If Harris and the Democratic Party are to have any hope, they must learn on this issue, like so many others, to address it by examining its root causes.\n\nIt's a pattern seen all over Latin America: U.S. policies foist hardships on those abroad , who then migrate to the U.S. in search of better lives.\n\nTake Venezuela, which has sent record numbers of immigrants to the U.S. following the imposition of of devastating American sanctions in recent years.\n\nIn Honduras and El Salvador too, hawkish U.S. foreign policies built on everything from anti-communism to the drug war have propelled droves of immigrants to U.S. shores.\n\nAnd yet, within the 2024 presidential race, these root causes of these crises - the push factors - never came up.\n\nInstead, Trump railed against immigrants in general. And, rather than pledging to enact a humane border policy and working internationally to slow emigration, Harris chose to ignore the issue altogether - or to run to Trump's right.\n\nIt did not need to be this way. Harris could have simply listened to the American people, who understand aspects of the immigration conundrum better than politicians seems to understand.\n\nAbout 71 percent of Americans, including majorities across the political spectrum, believe economic factors are largely behind the recent influx of migrants, whether it's better opportunities in the U.S. or poor conditions in their home countries, according to a report from the Pew Research Center. Sixty-five percent pointed to violence in migrants' home countries as a major reason for driving so many people to the U.S.\n\nNotably, the report also found that a sizable majority of Americans consider the influx of migrants a crisis or at least a major problem. Though Republicans were more likely to view it as a crisis, Democrats still mostly viewed the situation as a major problem. Only 7 percent of Democrats surveyed said it's not a problem at all.\n\nHarris touted herself as a former border-state prosecutor who would be tougher on the Southern frontier than Trump. During the presidential debate , Harris bragged about supporting a border bill that would have \"put 1,500 more border agents on the border.\"\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nIt's increasingly clear that the economic warfare the U.S. unleashes on the world comes with a steep political cost. With Republicans leading the charge, Democrats have little to show for going along with it.\n\nNot every Democrat, however, has acquiesced to right-wing narratives on immigration.\n\nLast year, border state Reps. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, and Raúl Grijalva, D-Ariz., tried warning Biden again.\n\n\"Rather than re-imposing Trump-era deterrence policies,\" they wrote, \"we must demonstrate a sharp contrast with these approaches by showing compassion towards migrants and upholding our asylum obligations, while simultaneously seeking to curb the broad-based sanctions that contribute to widespread suffering and spur increased migration.\"\n\n\"You have a historic opportunity to help mitigate economic push-factors driving migration and affecting our border and many of our cities, while reorienting U.S. policy in the hemisphere towards a more holistic approach that eschews destructive sanctions policies to focus on peace, stability, and prosperity for all inhabitants of the Americas,\" the letter continued .\n\nThat opportunity was available for Harris to seize during the presidential race. She could have offered an alternative vision for how the U.S. treats the world and the people who arrive at our borders from abroad.\n\nInstead, she tried - and failed - to co-opt Trump's talking points. Despite her best efforts, Trump's immigration attacks on Harris contributed to her election loss.\n\nNow everyone, immigrants and non-immigrants alike, must suffer the consequences.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "You Should Stop Calling Immigrants \"Migrants\"\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nA subtle bipartisan shift in the language of immigration has opened the door to vilification and dehumanization.\n\nDuring the presidential debate, Kamala Harris cracked up when Donald Trump ranted about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, supposedly snatching and eating local residents' cats and dogs . The vice president rolled her eyes and broke into a \"This dude is crazy\" chuckle.\n\nTrump's slander was dotty, but it was also chilling. And yet, despite being thoroughly debunked, the Trump campaign, including Ohio's own JD Vance, continued to latch onto the attacks against Haitians and other immigrants.\n\nHow did we get here, where such outlandish fictions about people who come to the U.S. can take hold of the body politic? This has been a long slide. And while the American right deserves much of the blame, liberals and progressives have, however unwittingly, contributed to the ways we think about immigrants too.\n\nWhile the right has embraced anti-immigration politics as a means to appeal to a white voter base energized by the threat of the Other, the left has stopped pushing back. Instead, politicians desperate to court moderate voters and a media that follows their lead have employed narratives and buzzwords implying that immigrants are seedy, animalistic, and dangerous.\n\nTo see how this sort of thing takes root and spreads, consider the word \"migrant.\" Today, it's the term of art from both the right and the left. \"Nearly 7.3 million migrants have illegally crossed the southwest border under President Biden's watch, a number greater than the population of 36 individual states,\" Fox News warned earlier this year , without noting that many, if not most, were seeking relief from government oppression, violence, and other dangerous and demeaning chaos. Meanwhile, the leftist daily news show \"Democracy Now!\" reported on people new to the U.S. being left in the cold in big cities, including New York, and called these neglected people \"migrants.\" The Nation titled a series of first-person accounts of immigrants \"Migrant Voices.\"\n\nIt used to be fairly rare to call human beings migrants. From the 16th to 19th centuries, the word mostly referred to birds and other animals that moved back and forth between different climates and terrains every year, not from desire or planning but from pure, immutable instinct.\n\nBy the early 20th century, \"migrant\" in the U.S. had commonly come to refer to Mexicans crossing north to do agricultural labor in states including Texas, California, and Colorado, following seasonal crops. The notion was that, unlike immigrants who uprooted their lives to resettle, migrants came for economic reasons and didn't fully intend to stay.\n\nNot all the people labeled as migrants, however, fit that bill. Some settled for good in the U.S. and during hot economic times came to be considered a permanent fixture of the American labor market, even while deemed social and racial inferiors.\n\nNot so today. Now, everyone who leaves a poor or troubled country and comes north to the United States is a \"migrant.\" This is how they're described by the New York Times, the Washington Post, NPR, CNN, and other major media.\n\nThe word \"migrant\" implies that they're traveling around unsettled: rolling stones with no intention of gathering moss and no right to land in one place.\n\nAs Al Jazeera has commented , \"migrant\" has \"evolved from its dictionary definitions into a tool that dehumanizes and distances, a blunt pejorative.\"\n\nIn recent years, voices have popped up to renounce the use of \"migrant\" - as Al Jazeera did in 2015 - or at least question its use . The English scholar of international affairs Alexander Betts uses the term \" survival migration \" to refer to how people are compelled to cross borders in order to live, even if they are not technically refugees under international law. The International Organization for Migration adds an adjective, making the phrase \" vulnerable migrants ,\" to refer to people needing protection and help, even if they are not refugees. Those voices, though, are few and far between, with the one-word use of \"migrant\" continuing to grow and negative connotations increasingly becoming attached to it.\n\nThe philologist Victor Klemperer wrote about these kinds of subtle language shifts under the Nazi regime. In his definitive study, \"The Language of the Third Reich,\" Klemperer, who himself narrowly avoided death at the hands of the Nazis, was less interested in the obvious language shifts - the kind of thing any antifascist would have recognized. Instead, he focused on the unnoticed changes, the ones that slipped by almost everyone; he called it \"the language of hysteria\" and \"the language which writes and thinks for you.\"\n\nThough it crept in quietly, these shifts of meaning could have dramatic effects, being used, for example, to demonize whole swaths of society. Today, we ought to be wary of these unnoticed shifts - and \"migrant\" is a good starting place, but only the start. Read Our Complete Coverage The War on Immigrants\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nThe shift to \"migrant\" has come with other buzzwords that at best dehumanize and at worst demonize.\n\nRepublicans often claim immigrants are carrying out an \" invasion .\" For even the liberal media, however, people come to the U.S. in \"waves,\" \"surges,\" and \"floods.\" On the Southern border, officials issue disaster declarations - even Democrats. Once over the border, some of the newly arrived will be sloshed north on buses and plans on the orders of officials from both parties.\n\nLittle help is forthcoming because Republicans in Congress won't allow it, and Democrats have allowed the GOP to own the issue of immigration - including its lexicon.\n\nRepublicans have been aggressively blaming immigrants for the country's woes for decades, and Democrats started wagging the tail of that dog almost three decades ago, under President Bill Clinton. Rather than mounting a challenge, his administration tacked rightward , with new policies supporting the deportation of people who fit a new buzzphrase: \"criminal alien.\"\n\nThat phrase was a variant of \"illegal alien,\" which was widespread in the 20th century and focused on calling immigrants \"aliens\": foreign things with no right to belong. Immigration rights activists in the 1980s protested that human beings could do illegal things but not be illegal. But during the so-called war on drugs, the category \"criminal alien\" expanded, sweeping up young and often people of color who were convicted of minor possession and distribution of marijuana (a substance that is now mostly legal). Only during the Biden administration did federal agencies ditch the words \"illegal\" and \"alien\" when referring to immigrants. Yet the president lapsed into \" illegal \" in his State of the Union address this past March. He later said he regretted not having instead used \"undocumented,\" which many advocates also consider dehumanizing.\n\nEvery Democratic administration since Clinton's has been increasingly hard on immigrants. The shock of 9/11 introduced and ossified another buzzphrase : \"border security.\" No one has been caught crossing from Mexico to the United States with plans for fomenting terror, and most fentanyl comes not from \"migrants\" but from big shipments in big trucks searched at official ports of entry. No matter. The Border Patrol has been hugely expanded in past decades, and high walls have been erected during Republican and Democratic administrations alike . Vast technologies of surveillance have been installed , including products supplied by a subsidiary of the Israeli-owned company Elbit , and used by Israel to control Palestinians . The number of immigrants who have perished trying to avoid this ever-increasing technology has shot up in recent years.\n\nAmid this mega-expansion, Republicans have been banging a verbal drum that's drowned out the Democrats, perhaps even brainwashed them. In the second quarter of this year, the latest period with available data , GOP candidates and political action committees ran 196 anti-immigrant ads that were viewed over 1.6 billion times. The ads' top buzzwords were \" border ,\" \" crime ,\" \" wall ,\" and \" fentanyl .\" During the same period, Democrats' output on the same topic was anemic: 17 ads with 296 million views.\n\nRather than defend or humanize immigrants, Democrats are trying to outdo Republicans in paranoia and militarism.\n\nAn LA Times analysis of political ads found Democrats in key swing districts going on the offense on border security . Democrat Will Rollins, running for Congress out of California, brags that as a federal prosecutor he put away drug lords and Mexican mafia members. One of his videos cuts to a Republican campaign sign that reads \"Secure the border!\" and Rollins criticizes his opponent for voting against a bill that would have increased the number of agents at the border. In Arizona, Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego launched an ad for his Senate campaign that opens with a sheriff next to a border wall and concertina wire, praising Gallego for \"fighting for solutions - better technology, more manpower, so people like me can do our jobs.\" In Washington state, Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez's ad promises to cooperate with Republicans to secure the border. That ad, too, features sheriffs touting her.\n\nIs it any surprise, then, that people in general are susceptible to the outrageous claims about immigrants' perfidy - and many Democrats are also credulous?\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris's ad about immigration does nothing to improve things. Never does she draw a direct line between immigration politics and the fact that both of her parents were immigrants, from Jamaica and India - people who, like virtually all immigrants now and in the past, have come to America with stunning energy, industry, and creativity, no matter jobs they've held. Instead, when speaking of immigration, Harris's ad says only that \"as a border state prosecutor, she took on drug cartels and jailed gang members for smuggling weapons and drugs across the border.\" It further notes: \"As vice president, she backed the toughest border control bill in decades. And as president, she will hire thousands more border agents and crack down on fentanyl and human trafficking.\"\n\nHer speech at the Democratic National Convention repeated these dark saws and worse. She promised to bring back a bipartisan immigration legislation that gives immigrants nothing, and which Harris dubbed the \"toughest border control bill in decades.\" It calls for \"more border security\" when border security is nothing more than border security theater: a true Klemperer lexeme. As for her platform, the only thing Harris offers to immigrants is \"an earned pathway to citizenship.\"\n\nThat might sound hopeful at first glance, but a portent of what \"earned pathway to citizenship\" actually means comes from a bipartisan House bill co-sponsored by Reps. Maria Elvira Salazar, R-Fla., and Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, who's from the U.S.-Mexico border city El Paso and is a co-chair of the Harris campaign.\n\nThe bill would offer immigrants without documentation who have lived in the United States for at least five years a four-year, quasi-legal status possibly leading to a green card - but only if they accede to the implication that they've robbed Americans and should be fined for it. To enroll, applicants must pay $5,000. They must also agree to have 1.5 percent of their wages garnished for years. All that money would go to a fund to compensate American workers for the jobs they've supposedly lost to immigrants. The bill calls immigrants \"aliens.\" And \"migrants.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nEscobar knows full well that immigrants who lack documentation do not steal Americans' jobs - in fact, they create them. Her own parents came from a family of immigrants who built up one of the biggest dairies in El Paso. Now their children are eminent public servants. I know all this because Escobar began her civic life as an immigrant rights activist, in an immigrant rights NGO that I founded.\n\nDo Democrats these days really have to use malign old language and make new terms to win elections? Their own loyal constituency likes immigrants. According to a joint Chicago Council on Global Affairs/Ipsos survey conducted earlier this year, over 80 percent of Democrats want to legalize the immigration status of people not authorized to live in the U.S., and 85 percent favor encouraging them to become citizens. Over 8 out of 10 want to make it easier for people fleeing violence to come to the U.S. and about three-fourths want more legal immigration. Most oppose deporting more people, and most oppose installing additional walls and similar barriers at the border.\n\nAnd this is Democrats in general , without age-cohort breakdowns. Younger voters are more likely than their elders to be pro-immigrant - and they are a key demographic whom Democrats say they need to win in November. Are they shooting themselves in the foot with their fear of Trumpism, their unwillingness to use truthful language about immigration?\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

For workers, we want union-friendly policy and a higher minimum wage. But what's the progressive North Star on immigration policy?\n\nIt's not obvious. From one direction, you have the idea that used to be pushed by politicians like Bernie Sanders over the years: that immigration needs to be restricted for the benefit of domestic workers. That used to be the AFL-CIO's position, though it's not anymore. From the other direction, you have those who argue borders are largely a relic of a bad idea - nationalism - and that human flourishing requires the freedom to migrate to be universal, or nearly so.

And it's also by no means a progressive consensus.\n\nWe also talked with Casar about tomorrow's election in Pakistan. Even as the State Department has largely shrugged off reports of flagrant abuse of the electoral process, members of Congress from both parties have been increasingly raising their voices, from both the top Republican and top Democrat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, to the intel-linked Democrat Abigail Spanberger, to Squad-y members like Rep. Summer Lee of Pennsylvania and Casar.\n\nI have a new story up at The Intercept on eight of the most flagrant violations .

      "text": "Crossing the U.S. Border? Here's How to Protect Yourself\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nSearches of phones and other electronics are on the rise for those entering the U.S. Take these steps to help secure your devices.\n\nThe crackdown is already happening. First, Mahmoud Khalil was snatched from his home in New York. Then, immigrants in the U.S. were targeted for their political views , and foreigners reported being denied entry at the border after having their devices searched.\n\nEven before Donald Trump was sworn in, border searches of electronics were steadily rising. With fears mounting about the Trump administration's attack on dissent, citizens and noncitizens alike are wondering how to protect their privacy.\n\nExperts say it is important to have a plan before you cross the border, to know the law, and to do what you can to minimize your digital footprint. The plans can vary widely based on a person's immigration status and other factors.\n\nHere are some tips on the law - and how to prevent the U.S. government from using your own data against you.\n\nIf you think you will simply be able to decline when a border agent asks you to hand over your phone or computer, think again.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection claims broad authority to rifle through the electronic devices of traveling into and out of the country, regardless of their citizenship status. American citizens can decline to hand over their password or PIN code - but that could result in travel delays and in device confiscation, experts warn.\n\nCBP claims to place some limits on its own searches of devices, and courts have issued conflicting rulings about the extent of the government's authority to search electronic devices collected at the border.\n\nOne of CBP's policies states that border agents are not supposed to search information that has only been stored remotely. As a practical matter, that often means that border agents put a phone into airplane mode before searching it.\n\nSophia Cope, an attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, said it was useful to know CBP policies.\n\n\"We know federal officers often don't follow the law and their own policy,\" said Cope, whose organization has published its own guide for travelers . \"If you know they're supposed to put the phone in airplane mode, for example, you can ask them about that.\"\n\nCBP says that its officers can conduct \"basic\" searches - where an officer scrolls through a device's contents on the spot - at their discretion. \"Advanced,\" forensic searches where devices are connected to outside devices for review are only supposed to occur upon \"reasonable\" suspicion of legal violations or a national security concern.\n\nIt is important to think about what you will do if a border agent asks for your personal devices well before you head to the airport. The last thing you want to do is to be caught flat-footed, Cope said.\n\nHer organization has recommended that travelers conduct a risk analysis based on their personal profile, including whether they are a citizen, lawful permanent resident, or visa holder, as well as what kind of data is stored on their device.\n\nCitizens have the right to reenter the U.S., but they can still have their devices seized. The ACLU says the same \"should\" be true for lawful permanent residents, also known as green card holders. However, the group also recommends that noncitizens concerned about having their devices searched \"should consult with an immigration lawyer about your particular circumstances before traveling.\"\n\nVisa holders, meanwhile, could be outright refused entry.\n\n\"It really just depends on what the person's unique situation is, and what their tolerance level is for confrontation and delay and short-term detention and missing their flights and - in more extreme cases - having their immigration status questioned,\" Cope said.\n\nThe best way to protect your personal and work devices from search and seizure is simply to leave them at home. Get separate devices that you only use when traveling, and reset them before each trip.\n\nCheaper and refurbished devices may suffice for many trips. If you absolutely need your usual devices on your trip, consider mailing them to your destination, although this could raise its own risks.\n\nBefore you get to a security checkpoint, and ideally before you're even at your port of entry or exit, fully power off all of your devices. This is important because some devices are in a more secure state before you log in to it for the first time after you've previously shut it down. For instance, forensics firms distinguish between iPhones in \"before first unlock\" versus \"after first unlock\" states, with the former coyly described as \"less helpful\" for data extraction.\n\nPart of practicing strong digital security is making sure you're exercising what's known as \"defense in depth\": Making sure that, should one level of security fail, another layer of protection is in place, just in case. For this reason, be sure to log out of all of your accounts before you power down. You could go as far as deleting the apps you've logged out from altogether, and reinstalling them after you're safely beyond the security checkpoint.\n\nIf you are worried about remembering a long list of passwords, that is a good sign you should use password manager software instead. Recommended by many experts , a password manager allows you to use one password to unlock all of your passwords. If your password manager has a travel mode that lets you restrict which specific accounts to display for the duration of your travel, enable it.\n\nMake sure that you're using an alphanumeric password to access your phone and other devices. Turn off all biometrics like fingerprint access and facial recognition (branded Touch ID and Face ID, respectively, on iPhones). Otherwise, authorities could put your phone up in front of your face to gain access.\n\nAside from making sure you're not logged into sensitive accounts, you should also make sure you're not storing sensitive data on your phone. One option is to download data from your phone onto an encrypted device you're not traveling with and leave it at home. Another option, if you need access to some data on the road, is to encrypt it using a tool like Cryptomator , store it on a cloud storage provider, and then download it when you've reached your destination.\n\nIf you're using an iPhone, you could back up your phone data using iCloud - just make sure you have Apple's end-to-end encryption solution, Advanced Data Protection , enabled. (If you're in certain regions, such as the U.K. , you'll need to switch your region location before you can use this feature.)\n\nDon't forget to make sure you also protect any sensitive contacts. Go through your contacts lists and remove any persons whose affiliation with you may potentially cause issues; for instance, if you have the names of activists, human rights defenders, or other sensitive sources. You could even export and then delete your entire contacts list and restore it later.\n\nIf you believe you are at especially high risk when crossing the border, there are more advanced steps you can take.\n\nOne option goes beyond leaving your phone at home. You could also leave your SIM card and phone number behind too. Let your contacts know that you'll have a temporary number while traveling. You can purchase a temporary SIM once you're in the country, or beforehand. The reason to leave behind your number is the same as leaving behind your phone - you don't want the authorities or anyone else to take control of your phone number. For instance, if the authorities take your SIM card and place it into their own device, they may be able to receive messages and calls meant for you.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nKeep in mind that if you're using SMS verification as a form of two-factor authentication for any accounts, you'll need to temporarily update it to your current number, or have someone with access to your phone at home be able to log you in.\n\nIdeally, however, you shouldn't be using SMS for two-factor authentication in the first place, as it's vulnerable to attackers taking control of your phone number . If there is no other form of two-factor authentication, SMS authentication is still better than nothing at all.\n\nIf you're apprehensive that having a phone with minimal information on it may in itself cause you to stand out during an intrusive security check - which experts say is a legitimate concern - keep in mind that it may be preferable to revealing sensitive information.\n\nAnother, more elaborate protection option, is what the intelligence community calls persona development : Creating alternate accounts which don't contain any sensitive information. In other words, you can snap innocuous photos and upload them to separate social media accounts for traveling. If your phone is searched, only these accounts will then be visible to the authorities.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "ICE Searched LexisNexis Database Over 1 Million Times in Just Seven Months\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nLexisNexis usage logs for Immigration and Customs Enforcement for seven months totaled 1,211,643 searches and 302,431 \"reports.\"\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement searched a massive database of personal information provided by LexisNexis over 1.2 million times in just a seven-month period in 2021, according to documents reviewed by The Intercept. Critics say the staggering search volume confirms fears that the data broker is enabling the mass surveillance and deportation of immigrants.\n\nThe Intercept first reported last year that ICE had purchased access to LexisNexis Risk Solutions databases for $16.8 million, unlocking an oceanic volume of personal information on American citizens and noncitizens alike that spans hundreds of millions of individuals, totaling billions of records drawn from 10,000 different sources. Becoming a LexisNexis customer not only provides law enforcement with instant, easy access to a wealth of easily searchable data points on hundreds of millions of people, but also lets them essentially purchase data rather than having to formally request it or seek a court order.\n\nInternal documents now show that this unfathomably large quantity of data is being searched with a regularity that is itself vast. LexisNexis usage logs between March and September 2021 totaled 1,211,643 searches and 302,431 \"reports,\" information packages that provide an exhaustive rundown of an individual's location, work history, family relationships, and many other data points aggregated by LexisNexis, a data broker better known for its legal research resources. Although the names were redacted, the logs show that a single user conducted over 26,000 searches in that period.\n\nMost of the queries were conducted through Accurint, a powerful LexisNexis tool that promises \"cutting-edge analytics and data linking,\" and touts its ability to provide a firehose of \"investigative intelligence\" to police on a national scale. \"Criminals have no boundaries,\" reads the Accurint homepage. \"So neither can you when it comes to critical investigative intelligence and crime reporting. That's why Accurint Virtual Crime Center gives you visibility beyond your own jurisdictions into regional and nationwide crime data.\"\n\nThe new documents , obtained by a Freedom of Information Act request by the immigrant advocacy organization Just Futures Law and shared with The Intercept, cast doubt on earlier assurances from LexisNexis that its sprawling database would be used only narrowly to target people with \"serious criminal backgrounds.\" In 2021, following widespread criticism of the ICE contract, LexisNexis published a brief FAQ attempting to downplay the gravity of the collaboration and dispel concerns their databases would facilitate dragnet surveillance and deportations. \"The tool promotes public safety and is not used to prevent legal immigration,\" reads the document, \"nor is it used to remove individuals from the United States unless they pose a serious threat to public safety including child trafficking, drug smuggling and other serious criminal activity.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nHowever, the logs show that a sizable share of the usage - over 260,000 searches and reports - were conducted by ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations, a branch explicitly tasked with finding and deporting immigrants, often for minor infractions or no offense at all. An internal ERO memo obtained through the FOIA request and also shared with The Intercept contradicts the idea that Accurint's use was to be narrowly focused on only the most dangerous criminal elements. In an email sent June 30, 2021, ERO's assistant director of enforcement wrote, \"Please note this additional valuable resource should be widely utilized by ERO personnel as an integral part of our mission to protect the homeland through the identification, location, arrest, and removal of noncitizens who undermine the safety of our communities and the integrity of our immigration laws.\" The email noted that LexisNexis would be directly providing ICE with educational seminars on how to most effectively use the data.\n\nICE's long documented history of rounding up immigrants with no criminal history or those with only nonviolent offenses like traffic violations further undermines the notion that these hundreds of thousands of ERO searches all pertained to hardened, dangerous criminals. A breakdown of LexisNexis usage by individual ICE office shows that the single highest generator of searches and reports, with a total of 56,467, was ERO's National Criminal Analysis and Targeting Center, a division tasked with locating immigrants who are merely deemed \"amenable to removal,\" according to agency documents . Though ICE and LexisNexis are both keen to couch these investigations as a bulwark against dangerous transnational terrorists and criminal syndicates, an analysis of 2019 ICE arrest data conducted by Syracuse University found that \" exceedingly few detainees \" had committed grave national security-related offenses like terrorism or election fraud, and that \"the growth in detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) over the past four years has been fueled by a steady increase in the number of detainees with no criminal history.\"\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage The War on Immigrants\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\n\"LexisNexis is using the same type of scare tactics ICE tries to use to justify the brutality of their deportation mission,\" said Just Futures Law attorney Dinesh McCoy, who worked on the FOIA request. \"There's no indication, based on the huge number of searches conducted, nor from the records that we've seen, that ICE uses LexisNexis technology in a confined way to target 'serious' criminal activity. We know thousands of ICE employees are empowered to use this tech, and we know that officers are given significant discretion to make investigative and strategy decisions about how they locate immigrants.\"\n\nThough ICE arrests have fallen under the Biden administration , experts say they remain concerned by Accurint's use and potential to snare people who've committed no crime beyond fleeing their home country. \"We're seeing a continuation of harmful surveillance practices under this administration,\" McCoy wrote via email. \"We need real opposition to the constant expansion of ICE's power and infrastructure, but by providing the agency with invasive tools like Accurint, the Biden Administration is just strengthening ICE's institutional position for the future.\" The marked decline in post-Trump ICE arrests presents an odd context for the massive scale of ICE's searches: During roughly the same period tracked by the LexisNexis logs, ERO made 72,000 arrests after conducting over three times as many individual searches. A Homeland Security Investigations special agent prepares to arrest alleged immigration violators at Fresh Mark meat processing plant in Salem, Ohio, on June 19, 2018. Photo: Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images Over 630,000 of the searches and reports were run by Homeland Security Investigations, an ICE division tasked with investigating an expansive array of \"threats,\" from human trafficking and terrorism to \"scams\" and identity theft. But along with HSI's broad mandate have come allegations of dragnet spy tactics and indiscriminate policing. In a letter to Homeland Security Inspector General Joseph Cuffari in March, Sen. Ron Wyden wrote that he'd learned HSI had \"abused\" its federal authority and \"was operating an indiscriminate and bulk surveillance program that swept up millions of financial records about Americans.\"\n\nA Homeland Security Investigations special agent prepares to arrest alleged immigration violators at Fresh Mark meat processing plant in Salem, Ohio, on June 19, 2018.\n\nHSI also regularly assists with ERO's mass detention and deportation operations, including a 2018 workplace raid in Tennessee that separated children from their parents and left hundreds of students too afraid to return to school. In a March article for Just Security, Mary Pat Dwyer of the Brennan Center wrote that HSI \"often uses its transnational crime mission to investigate immigrants of color who are not suspected of criminal activity,\" including investigations into naturalized citizens \"looking for inconsistencies in their documents or old deportation orders as grounds to strip them of citizenship.\"\n\nThe logs provide a greater understanding of how ICE is making use of LexisNexis Risk Solutions, which provides a varied suite of search tools to navigate the company's voluminous store of government records and commercial data. The overwhelming majority of the searches, over 700,000 in total, were conducted using Accurint's \"Advanced Person Search,\" which lets users enter fragments of data they might have on an individual - a relative, a former job, a nickname - and match it against a pool of millions of identities. Over 200,000 other searches were run against Accurint's database of phone provider records, more than 63,000 vehicle record searches, and nearly 10,000 different queries hunting for social media profiles. The logs also show nearly 6,000 searches for Accurint's index of jail booking activity, an ICE tactic recently reported by The Guardian as an explicit means of skirting \"sanctuary city\" laws that block local police from sharing such information with immigration agencies. With LexisNexis access, it is now trivial for an agency to essentially buy its way around such restrictions.\n\nNeither ICE nor LexisNexis responded to a request for comment.\n\nUsed in concert, these searches grant ICE, an agency already charged with brutal and indiscriminate tactics against some of American society's most vulnerable members, with an immense technological advantage when seeking its targets. It's difficult to overstate the enormity of LexisNexis's databases, and equally difficult to imagine avoiding being absorbed into them. Financial records, property records, past jobs, former marriages, phone subscriptions, cable TV bills, car registrations - critics of LexisNexis's government work note that it's near impossible to exist today without leaving behind traces that are quickly vacuumed up into the company's colossal trove of public and proprietary data points, continuously indexed and rendered instantly searchable. Put in the hands of agencies like ICE, the mountains of digital paperwork one accumulates during ordinary civic and consumer lives can be easily turned against us. A 2021 report by the Washington Post found that ICE had previously tapped a database of utility records while searching for immigration offenses, leaving those who fear detention or deportation with a grim choice between the basic amenities of modern life and the perpetual risk of data broker-enabled arrest.\n\nDespite the vastness of LexisNexis's data and the advertised sophistication of the tools it provides law enforcement to comb through that data, the company itself quietly warns that it may be providing inaccurate information, the consequences of which could upend a life or entire family. \"Due to the nature of the origin of public record information, the public records and commercially available data sources used in reports may contain errors. Source data is sometimes reported or entered inaccurately, processed poorly or incorrectly, and is generally not free from defect,\" reads a small warning at the bottom of a marketing page for Accurint Virtual Crime Center, a tool used heavily by ICE according to the search logs. \"Before relying on any data, it should be independently verified.\"\n\nIt's not just those individuals in ICE's crosshairs who need to fear being implicated by a LexisNexis search. Accurint promotional and training materials make frequent mention of the software's ability to not only locate people via the records they leave in their wake, but also trace real-life social networks, potentially drawing friends, family, neighbors, and co-workers under federal scrutiny. An Accurint training manual marked \"Confidential and Proprietary\" but publicly accessible via a LexisNexis website shows how users can obtain \"information about a subject's relatives, neighbors, and associates,\" including \"possible relative phones\" two degrees removed from the target. The fact that a single search can yield results about multiple people or entire families suggests that the number of people subjected to LexisNexis-based surveillance could be far more than the already large 1.2 million figure might indicate. \"We're seeing that ICE is running a system of mass surveillance,\" said Cinthya Rodriguez, a national organizer with the immigrant rights group Mijente. \"What we're really talking about is possibly upwards of three times that 1.2 million, perhaps upwards of 3 million searches happening in that period of time. ... What we're saying is, perhaps 1 percent of the U.S. population was under ICE surveillance.\"\n\nThat something as mundane as having heat or running water at home could draw the attention of the federal deportation machine, and that this machine could then turn its sights on one's personal support network, has left immigrant communities in a state of perpetual fear, said Rodriguez. \"Immigrants are forced to face impossible choices about what kind of services they need and the information they have to turn over in order to access those services, everything ranging from their electric bills to buying a car, to information about their children's schools,\" Rodriguez explained in an interview. \"Everything we touch can have serious implications for building out ICE's digital dragnet.\"\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "What to Know About Trump's Day One Attack on Immigration\n\nStephen Miller, a top advisor to Trump on immigration, arrives before the presidential inauguration. Julia Demaree Nikhinson/picture-alliance/dpa/AP Images\n\nOn his first day back in office, President Donald Trump signed around 10 executive orders to restrict immigration to the United States. \"With these actions, we will begin the complete restoration of America and the revolution of common sense,\" he said during his inauguration speech. \"It's all about common sense.\"\n\nThe promises, many pushed by top advisor Stephen Miller, were striking. Trump vowed to declare a \"national emergency\" and \"send troops\" to the US-Mexico border (even though border crossings have reached a low point at the end of the Biden administration), among other major actions. Asylum seekers and refugees will feel the consequences. And the executive orders are bound to get caught in legal fights.\n\nHere's a recap of Trump's day-one executive orders on immigration:\n\nTrue to his campaign promise , Trump did issue an order to go into effect in 30 days to deny citizenship to certain US-born children if the mother does not have legal status or is on a temporary visa at the time of birth and the father is not a US citizen or legal permanent resident. That may sound complex. But the reality is simple: If Trump gets his way, no longer does being born in the US mean you're a citizen.\n\nIt didn't take long for immigrant rights groups and several states to file lawsuits challenging the executive for violating the 14th Amendment of the constitution-and more than a century of legal precedent-that guarantees birthright citizenship. (We have written about the long crusade to kill birthright citizenship before.)\n\nTrump signed a blanket suspension on the resettlement of refugees until it \"aligns with the interests of the United States.\" That suspension will go into effect on Monday, January 27 and last at least four months. It also mandates that states and local jurisdictions should have a larger role in the resettlement process. Alongside the suspension, Trump is bringing back the so-called \"Remain in Mexico\" policy: forcing tens of thousands of asylum seekers and migrants to wait in dangerous US-Mexico border towns as their cases go through the backlogged immigration courts. His administration also ended the use of the Biden-era CBP One phone application for asylum seekers to present at the border lawfully. (Appointments were canceled as a result, leaving thousands of people stranded.) Finally, he cited extraordinary presidential authorities to declare an \"invasion\" at the border and allow government officials to \"repel, repatriate, or remove\" migrants, including asylum seekers.\n\nAs part of an executive order to protect \"the American people against an invasion,\" Trump revoked several presidential actions taken during the Biden administration. That includes an executive order that established a Department of Homeland Security task force to work on the reunification of families that had been separated at the border during the first Trump administration. As of March 2024, the task force had helped 795 children reunite with their parents. As I have reported, many families are still separated seven years later.\n\nMany of Trump's executive orders boost the detention and deportation apparatus his administration would need to conduct mass deportations. That includes the US military. Trump has declared a \"national emergency\" at the southern border in an effort to unlock federal authorities and additional resources and called on the Armed Forces-including reserves and the National Guard-to help the Department of Homeland Security with immigration enforcement. It also instructs the Department of Defense to provide support in the form of detention space and transportation airplanes.\n\nTrump is moving to designate drug cartels and certain gangs-such as MS-13 and Tren de Aragua-as foreign terrorist organizations. This action prepares the terrain for Trump to invoke the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to expedite detentions and deportations without due process. During his inauguration speech, the president said he would use this wartime statute to unleash the \"full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement\" against what he calls an \"invasion.\"\n\nDespite the breadth and depth of these presidential actions, this is just the beginning. The Trump administration is also upending the immigration system in hard-to-track ways: He has already fired several top officials in charge of the Department of Justice's Executive Office for Immigration Review that oversees the immigration courts, where there are an estimated 3.7 million pending cases. Trump also revoked a policy by the Biden administration discouraging US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) from arresting immigrants \"in or near protected areas\" such as schools, hospitals, and churches.\n\nThe federal government is on the attack. The administration has further signaled it will attempt to defund sanctuary cities and deny grants to organizations offering services to immigrants. It will also double down on cooperation agreements between ICE and local and state sheriffs and police departments. States and local authorities can still stand up to Trump's mass deportation plans. That will require key Democratic officials to take a stance. Notably, New York Mayor Eric Adams attended Trump's inauguration and later sat down for an interview with Tucker Carlson, instead of fighting back.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "How Trump Plans to Upend Immigration\n\nMother Jones illustration; John Moore/Getty; Alex Brandon/AP\n\nIn January, former President Donald Trump will reclaim the White House after years of vowing to unleash an unprecedented overhaul of the immigration system in the United States. With mass deportation as a central promise of his campaign, Trump will undoubtedly build on the sweeping crackdown that marked his first term.\n\nHe already has promised to restore the travel prohibition on foreigners from Muslim-majority countries (often called the \"Muslim ban\"). He wants to revive \"Remain in Mexico\"-which left thousands of vulnerable migrants and asylum seekers awaiting court hearings stranded in dangerous border towns. Trump has also taken his anti-immigrant rhetoric and proposals to new heights, notably by pledging to carry out the \" largest domestic deportation operation in American history \" and attacking legal immigration .\n\nIndiscriminate workplace raids, massive detention camps, and around-the-clock deportation flights. That's the radical vision to remove millions of undocumented immigrants put forward by Trump.\n\nTrump's efforts to reshape the immigration landscape are likely to start immediately. Appearing on Fox News the morning after the election, the president-elect's spokesperson Karoline Leavitt celebrated a \"resounding victory\" and a \"mandate to govern as he campaigned to deliver on the promises that he made, which include, on day one, launching the largest mass deportation operation of illegal immigrants.\"\n\nImmigrant rights groups and lawyers have been diligently preparing for the possibility of a Trump comeback. Not unlike the first time around, they will inevitably pursue strategic litigation to stop some of the next administration's harshest, and possibly unlawful, policies. \"I've sued every president since George W. Bush, including Presidents Obama and Biden,\" Karen Tumlin, founder and director of Justice Action Center, said in a statement. \"We have a simple message for President-elect Trump or his deputies if they decide to make good on their despicable plans: We will see you in court.\"\n\nStill, the breadth and depth of Trump's agenda will have lasting impact, not only on immigrants who will directly bear the brunt of a heightened militarized immigration enforcement environment, but also on all Americans.\n\nHere's how.\n\nLaunch Mass Deportation\n\nIndiscriminate workplace raids, massive detention camps, and around-the-clock deportation flights. That's the radical vision to remove millions of undocumented immigrants put forward by Trump and Stephen Miller, his senior adviser on immigration. They would attempt to accomplish it by invoking a 18th-century wartime law known as the Alien Enemies Act-last used during World War II for the internment of Japanese, Italian, and German nationals-and deploying the full force of law enforcement agencies and the US military in violation of due process rights and the law.\n\nA mass deportation campaign would permanently change the United States. It could lead to racial profiling, the potential separation of families, and the wrongful deportation of Americans and lawful residents. It would also ruin the economy.\n\nThe logistical and practical challenges of purging even 1 million people a year are considerable, not to mention the moral and human devastation. But, if realized, a recent analysis by the American Immigration Council found that such a project would cost $967.9 billion over more than a decade. The deportation of immigrant workers who are the backbone of so many critical industries would also break the economy, resulting in an estimated drop of up to 6.8 percent in gross domestic product.\n\nEnd Birthright Citizenship\n\nTrump promised to sign an executive order on day one to end the long-standing constitutional guarantee of citizenship for those born in the United States, regardless of their parents' immigration status. The order would instruct federal agencies to require that at least one parent be a US citizen or lawful permanent resident for a child to be granted automatic citizenship.\n\n\"This current policy is based on a historical myth and a willful misinterpretation of the law by the open borders advocate,\" Trump has said. Birthright citizenship is enshrined in the 14th Amendment of the Constitution-and reaffirmed in Supreme Court decisions-which states that, with very few exceptions, \"all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.\"\n\nRevive the \" Muslim Ban\"\n\nDuring his first term, Trump took 472 executive actions in his bid to reshape the immigration system. One of them was the infamous \"Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States\" order, which permanently suspended the resettlement of refugees from Syria and barred the entry of travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries-Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. The policy created instant chaos, sparked international repudiation, and galvanized Americans all over the country.\n\nTrump has vowed to restore the so-called Muslim ban. The original iterations faced repeated legal challenges. Federal appeals courts ruled against the Trump administration, concluding that the executive order's \"stated national security interest was provided in bad faith\" and \"drips with religious intolerance, animus, and discrimination.\" But in a 5-4 decision in June 2018, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to carry out a version of the ban. On his first day in office, President Joe Biden issue a proclamation reversing it.\n\nEnd Immigration Programs\n\nHundreds of thousands of people from all over the world who currently benefit from Temporary Protected Status (TPS)-granted to those fleeing wars, natural disasters, and other country-specific circumstances-are at risk of losing protection against deportation.\n\nThat includes nationals of Haiti, Yemen, Afghanistan, Ukraine, and Venezuela. The Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 playbook, crafted by a number of administration-in-waiting former officials, specifically calls for the repeal of TPS designations.\n\nWhile in office, Trump tried to rescind the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program that shields from deportation the undocumented youth brought to the United States as children. There were as many as 535,030 active DACA recipients as of June 2024. Miller has said a second Trump administration would again attack the program, whose fate already lies with the courts. \"It would be absolutely catastrophic,\" Michelle Ming, political director at United We Dream, says of the prospect of tens of thousands of young people losing status. \"It would destroy families. It would destroy entire communities.\"\n\nRoll B ack Refugee Resettlement\n\nIn a September social media post in which he introduced to concept of remigration , Trump said he would \"suspend refugee resettlement.\" The first Trump administration dealt a massive blow to the US refugee resettlement program, and it likely wouldn't be different this time. In September, Trump said he would \"ban refugee resettlement from terror-infested areas like the Gaza Strip.\"\n\nAs president, he set an annual cap of 15,000 refugee admissions. The number of admissions went from 84,994 during President Barack Obama's last year in office to a record low of 11,814 in 2020. Ultimately, the Trump administration resettled fewer refugees than any other going back at least to the Carter administration. Upon taking the White House, Joe Biden worked to restore the program, resettling 100,034 refugees in fiscal year 2024-the most in decades.\n\nRestrict Legal Immigration\n\nWhile Trump has tried to signal that he's in favor of legal immigration pathways, his allies have been preparing the terrain to severely restrict them. \"Decades of 'we're not against legal immigration' will culminate in the largest cut to legal immigration in US history,\" David J. Bier, director of immigration studies at the Cato Institute, posted on X.\n\nTheir plans include severely curbing asylum, ending diversity lottery visas, and doing away with temporary legal programs like parole that have allowed immigrants from countries such as Haiti, Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Cuba to come to the United States after being vetted and securing a sponsor. They could even resuscitate the public charge rule making it harder for low-income immigrants to qualify for visas and green cards.\n\nImmigration lawyers have additionally warned that, in a second Trump administration, visa processing might be subject to delays and increased denial rates. \"If Donald Trump is elected president in November 2024,\" the National Foundation for American Policy stated , \"he should be expected to restrict legal immigration, including green cards and [high-skilled] H-1B visas.\"\n\nThe Project 2025 agenda contemplates undermining T and U visas for undocumented immigrant victims of trafficking and certain crimes who cooperate with law enforcement. (These temporary protections serve as a powerful tool to encourage victims to report crimes and keep their communities safe.) It also envisions winding down crucial temporary agricultural worker programs.\n\nProjecting a scenario in which Trump's policies result in less immigration and even more people leaving the United States than entering, a preelection Brookings Institution analysis concluded the GDP in 2025 would be $130 billion lower than under a Harris administration.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Democrats Could Give Republicans Vast New Immigration Powers\n\nSen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) at the US Capitol last month. Francis Chung/AP/AP\n\nWith Donald Trump less than two weeks away from taking office and promising an agenda of mass deportations, Democrats are poised to hand Republicans major new powers over immigration policy. Why? Still shell-shocked from the November results, they apparently fear their reelection prospects if they don't.\n\nThe Laken Riley Act -named for the 22-year-old Georgia woman who was murdered last year by a Venezuelan migrant who was in the country illegally-passed the House with support from 48 Democrats earlier this week. Senators voted overwhelmingly in favor of advancing the bill on Thursday before potentially considering amendments and voting on the bill itself. The legislation would both mandate the detention of certain undocumented immigrants and make it easier for Republican attorneys general to sue the federal government over immigration matters-legal challenges that could then lead to sweeping decisions by right-wing judges.\n\nRepublicans do not have the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster in Senate on their own. But they may attract enough Democratic support to pass the bill. Sens. John Fetterman (D-Pa.), Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), and Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) have already signaled they will support the bill. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) told The Hill that she was \"inclined\" to support the bill as well.\n\nThe willingness of Democrats, particularly those in swing districts and states, to support the bill is a sign of how vulnerable many in the party now understand themselves to be on immigration. Instead of fighting Donald Trump's immigration agenda, as they did during his first term, Democrats are increasingly willing to cave to it in the hopes of insulating themselves from future Republican attacks.\n\nDemocratic legislators are not wrong to conclude that they paid a political price for the years of dysfunction at the border that expanded to cities across the nation during Joe Biden's administration. But the bill they are considering voting for would do nothing, at least directly, to create order at the border. And despite its name, its most important provisions have little to do with Laken Riley.\n\nSpecifically, the bill would give state attorneys general explicit authority to sue the federal government in a number of situations where they allege that even minor harm has been caused by a range of federal immigration enforcement decisions. This would be a break from the status quo under which the federal government has almost exclusive control over immigration matters. After being filed, lawsuits from Republican attorneys general would often get heard by right-wing district court judges in states like Texas. Those judges could then order sweeping changes that have major national and international implications.\n\nOne provision would let attorneys general sue the US Secretary of State to demand that judges restrict, or ban, visas from countries that refuse to take back citizens who are ordered deported from the United States. As Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, explained in an op-ed for MSNBC, the list of these \"recalcitrant\" countries ranges from smaller nations like Cuba to major world powers such as China and India.\n\nBoth Republican and Democratic administrations have decided that the costs of banning everyone from China and India, for example, outweighs whatever benefits might come from increasing deportations to those countries. \"Yet should the Laken Riley Act become law,\" Reichlin-Melnick noted, \"that decision may no longer be in the hands of our nation's top diplomats and law enforcement officers; it could be in the hands of a single federal district court judge in Texas or Louisiana.\"\n\nA related provision in the bill would allow attorneys general to sue the US Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security effectively anytime federal immigration officials decide to release someone from detention while their case proceeds. The law is written so that attorneys general cannot sue to challenge a decision to keep someone detained.\n\nDespite the significance of these provisions, much of the attention has focused on a different section of the bill. That part would subject undocumented immigrants to mandatory detention if they are arrested, charged, or admit to shoplifting, theft, and other related crimes.\n\nRepublicans are focusing on theft in particular because of Ibarra's criminal history. In October 2023, he and his brother were arrested for shoplifting in Georgia. Later that year, a bench warrant was issued for Ibarra's arrest when he missed his court date. Two months later, he murdered Riley. (In November, a Georgia judge found Ibarra guilty and sentenced him to life in prison without parole.)\n\nThe language in the bill is a break with sections of US law that require someone be convicted of certain crimes to face mandatory detention. It is also worth stressing that immigration authorities already have broad authority to detain undocumented immigrants-including those charged with theft. The bill advancing now would require that they do so.\n\nThere is also no statute of limitations in cases where someone admits to having stolen something. As a result, an undocumented immigrant who admitted to shoplifting decades ago-potentially in a different country-could face mandatory detention if the bill becomes law. Sarah Mehta, senior policy at the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement that it could lead to detaining \"a mother who admits to shoplifting diapers for her baby, or elderly individuals who admit to nonviolent theft when they were teenagers.\"\n\nBut it is the transfer of power to Republican attorneys general and judges allied with them that would likely have the most far-reaching consequences. As Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) recently warned about the bill, \"I fear that it's only going to be when it comes to peoples' doorsteps that they're going to realize fully what people have consented to.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "\"Half My Students Were Gone\": How Trump's Immigration Agenda Is Disrupting Education\n\nShortly after President Donald Trump's 2025 inauguration, rumors of ICE agents in Massachusetts schools led students to stay home. Mother Jones illustration; LM Otero/AP\n\nWhen Sam, a third-grade teacher in the greater Boston area, walked into her classroom January 30, about a third of her students were absent. \"The sun was beating down so hard and it was reflecting off the desks in the room, and the desks were empty,\" Sam remembers. \"And I was like-oh my god. This is so sad. I don't know why it touched me like that: the sun beaming on the tables that were empty.\"\n\nSam's school district in Framingham, Massachusetts, is diverse: English learners make up 37 percent of the student population. But it wasn't a one-off. Educators and school officials in other metro Boston districts reported similar noticeable drops in attendance, too, as students fear President Donald Trump's increased push to mass deport millions. (The teachers asked that their names be withheld for fear of attracting unwanted attention to their schools.)\n\n\"The thing I kept getting is: 'What if I go home today and my parents are already gone?'\" one teacher said.\n\nIn January, one middle school science teacher told Mother Jones , there were days when \"half my students were gone...they all agreed to stay home.\" Many of her students-including Brazilian, Haitian, and Guatemalan children-live with undocumented family members. When messages started circulating on WhatsApp warning that US Immigration and Customs Enforcement was patrolling the area the last week of January, many became afraid to leave their homes.\n\nTheir anxiety was justified. Almost immediately upon taking office, the Trump administration rescinded a previous policy that limited ICE arrests in or around so-called \"sensitive\" locations: places of worship, hospitals, and schools. To keep with campaign promises, the White House began advertising its deportation efforts and sending a message to all undocumented immigrants that nowhere is safe.\n\n\"The thing I kept getting is: 'What if I go home today and my parents are already gone?'\" the science teacher said. \"'I don't want to come to school because I don't want them to be taken while I'm not home.'\" The topic of ICE, one middle school teacher said in early February, has come up \"every single period I've taught.\" Students want to know what will happen if ICE comes to school-and the teacher isn't sure what to tell them.\n\n\"Some students asked, 'Are we going to practice, like an [active shooter] drill, for when ICE comes?'\" she said. There's no protocol for that, but the teacher tries to reassure them that she'll do what she can to make her classroom safe.\n\nIn one district, news of ICE activity in the local grocery store coincided with 1,031 of the district's 6,137 students staying home.\n\nThe Trump administration's assault on public education has been thorough: from proposing to dismantle the federal Department of Education and redirecting federal funds to private schools to threatening teachers who fail to align with the president's ideological priorities . But there are other more insidious ways in which the federal government is undermining schooling for some of the country's most vulnerable youth. Trump's immigration-enforcement-first agenda has given rise to legitimate apprehension, waves of misinformation, and even threats of vigilantism. As a result, immigrant students throughout the United States are afraid .\n\nIn Boston-area schools, that environment has had far-reaching effects on students, teachers, and entire communities.\n\n\"There was this picture of two people getting arrested and pinned to the ground next to unmarked vans\" that students and their families passed around on WhatsApp and Snapchat, one teacher in a district west of Boston told Mother Jones . Reports also spread of ICE agents at a grocery store , Market Basket, in Chelsea. \"A couple kids told me they saw people getting arrested from the downstairs of their building, in their apartment complex,\" another educator said.\n\nThe chilling effect could be felt almost immediately in some cases. Chelsea Public Schools communications director Michael Sullivan said news of ICE activity in the local grocery store January 22 coincided with 1,031 of the district's 6,137 students-almost 90 percent of whom are Hispanic or Latino-not showing up to school that day. The only other out-of-the-ordinary showing, he noted, took place on the nationwide \" Day Without Immigrants \" action in early February.\n\nIn Lynn, a school district northeast of Boston, the week of January 27 saw an absenteeism rate 20 percent higher than the week of January 13. And in Malden schools, a rumor went around one day in late January that ICE agents were lurking in the parking lot of a local CVS store, startling the students to the point that a high school principal went to CVS to investigate and later announced over the school's intercom that they were safe.\n\nLast month, the Massachusetts attorney general's office issued guidance on \"schools' legal obligations\" to protect immigrant students and guarantee their right to free public education. It instructed schools to follow a protocol when dealing with ICE interactions with students, including obtaining a signed judicial warrant and consulting with the district's legal counsel. The directive also noted that under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, schools are generally prohibited from divulging student information to ICE without parental consent.\n\nSome school districts were preparing for these scenarios even before Inauguration Day. Kellie Jones, director of bilingual education at Brockton Public Schools, a district south of Boston with high numbers of Cabo Verdean and Haitian students, said the district hosted two immigration-focused forums in partnership with the mayor and police to clarify the schools' duty to enroll students irrespective of immigration status and how to respond to ICE's presence.\n\nStill, false rumors of ICE raiding Massachusetts schools in late January unleashed fear in the community. \"I can say that I had a report of a high school class that normally had around 35 students in it and that Thursday [January 30] had seven,\" Jones said. Districts like Brockton do not collect information on students' immigration status as a matter of policy but do keep data on, for example, their English language level. In Brockton, which has enrolled hundreds of recent immigrants in the past couple of years, about a third of students in grades 2-12 are not yet English proficient, Jones said.\n\n\"Some of the anxiety is not necessarily when they are in school, but in these soft spaces between school and home,\" she explained. \"We've had questions like: 'Well, I'm a walker, will I be safe walking from school to home and home to school? Will someone be waiting for me when I get off the bus?'\" Jones fears students and families will disengage from after-school programs and activities.\n\nIn some cases, lowered attendance numbers may have a domino effect on districts trying to exit state-run \"receivership\"-a status under which a school district's administrative responsibilities are outsourced to the state and local student support resources are cut-due to low attendance and low test scores.\n\nIn early 2020, the advocacy group Lawyers for Civil Rights found through public records obtained via litigation 135 instances of student incident reports made available to ICE going back several years.\n\nBut it's hard to convince kids to focus on a homework assignment if they're afraid they or their families might be deported, teachers say.\n\nImmigrant students who were brought to the US as children say they are frustrated: They feel like they're being punished for something out of their control. Others aren't entirely sure what \"undocumented\" means. The middle school science teacher said some of her students, Haitians with Temporary Protected Status that was recently announced as being scaled back, wonder what happens next.\n\n\"Some kids came here on foot,\" she added. \"I have this student who's like: 'I just got here four years ago, and we went through 30 days of crossing the desert, swimming rivers, all these different things. We hopped on the back of 'la bestia' [the beast ] and came here, and now we might be getting deported.'\"\n\nA number of school districts in Massachusetts have sent reassuring messages to the communities and publicly declined to cooperate or share students' records with ICE. But that hasn't always been the case. During the first Trump presidency, Boston Public Schools, the state's largest school district, came under fire for feeding student data to the Boston Regional Intelligence Center, a law enforcement hub that enables information sharing with federal immigration authorities. In 2017, a school incident report triggered the deportation of an East Boston High School student to El Salvador.\n\nIn early 2020, the advocacy group Lawyers for Civil Rights found through public records obtained via litigation 135 instances of student incident reports made available to ICE going back several years. That included write-ups for nonviolent disciplinary infractions. After that information came to light, exposing what Lawyers for Civil Rights called a \"school-to-deportation pipeline,\" Oren Sellstrom, the organization's litigation director, said the city of Boston reaffirmed its commitment to an ordinance limiting the exchange of information between local law enforcement and ICE.\n\n\"I think it's always been and remains a concern among those who work with immigrant communities that what is written on paper may not be honored in practice, and that remains a concern,\" Sellstrom said. \"Although, at least theoretically, there are now more protections in place, the concern still does remain that some of that information sharing may, in fact, still be happening.\" (Boston Public Schools didn't respond to questions from Mother Jones before publication.)\n\nJones of Brockton Public Schools, who has held her position as bilingual education director for a decade, said what's happening now \"is very comparable to what we saw the first time\" with Trump. The difference now, she notes, \"is that we are more knowledgeable and we are better prepared.\"\n\nDistricts-and, increasingly, individual teachers-are trying to take student safety into their own hands. The Worcester School District, the second largest in Massachusetts, told bus drivers not to cooperate with ICE. Some teachers say their districts are training them to differentiate between ICE and other law enforcement agencies and to identify the specific type of warrant an ICE agent would need to legally enter a school. Others are printing out \"red cards,\" pocket-sized pamphlets describing a person's legal rights to refuse to open the door if an ICE agent knocks. One Boston-area teacher said students were eager to take them home.\n\n\"I didn't tell my administration this or ask for permission, but I ended up printing out red cards in Spanish and Portuguese, and I laminated them and handed them out to kids that have confided in me that their parents weren't documented or they weren't documented. I guess those kids told other kids. And by noon, I had 20 to 30 kids coming in and asking if I could print them one, too.\"\n\nStudents are doing what they can to protect their families, and teachers are doing what they can to protect their students. But that doesn't mean the fear won't cause lasting harm.\n\n\"It's not just a scare tactic, it's a reality. People are actually scared,\" said Sam, the Framingham teacher. \"People are openly having conversations in front of their children, which we are then hearing in elementary schools, about self-deportation and leaving the country.\" Then, when students don't show up in class, \"that has a real impact.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Fear Is the Goal\n\nUS Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer in Silver Spring, Maryland. Alex Brandon/AP\n\nTrump's first week back in office delivered what he does best: dystopian showmanship.\n\nPhotos of deportation flights released with glee; shots of the military deployed to the border to handle an \"invasion\" at its lowest levels in years . Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) publishing on social media numbers of arrests and deportations (not that much greater than under the previous administration) like a scorecard. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem with a glamour shot in the New York Post doing a ride-along raid in New York City. Federal agents working with ICE on operations reportedly being told to be \"camera ready\" and wear tactical gear identifying their agency for the media. Trump talking about a migrant facility at Guantanamo Bay .\n\nThis blitz is more than just an indication of a real crackdown. It is the point in and of itself. The horrific spectacle of Trump's mass deportation chimera produces one of the key goals: widespread terror.\n\nMaybe the endgame is the elusive right-wing dream of \" self-deportation .\" Maybe it just gives the impression of \" promise made, promise kept .\" Either way, the administration will cheer the deportation machine the United States has long relied on as if Trump was the first to make use of it.\n\nConsider how on January 24, the White House account on X shared a photo of immigrants being loaded onto a cargo plane. \"Deportation flights have begun,\" Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt declared . \"President Trump is sending a strong and clear message to the entire world: if you illegally enter the United States of America, you will face severe consequences.\"\n\n\"This desire to popularize fear is unconscionable and abhorrent.\"\n\nImmigration experts and observers were quick to point out that deportation flights never stopped during the Biden administration. The novelty, American Immigration Council senior fellow Aaron Reichlin-Melnick noted, was the \"PR\" element of using a military aircraft. \"This is utter propaganda,\" he wrote, \"and you have to make sure not to fall for it.\" Tom Cartwright, an immigration activist who monitors ICE deportation flights, called it a \"theater of the absurd.\"\n\nThe shock and awe, as Lauren Carasik, a clinical professor of law and director of the Global Justice Clinic at Western New England University, writes in the Boston Review is meant to \"ratchet up anxiety and overwhelm and disempower not only immigrants but the rights groups and even the faith-based and health care institutions that seek to protect them.\"\n\nIn short: Fear is the goal.\n\nThe effect looks like immigrant families keeping children at home instead of sending them to school. From Colorado to Virginia , superintendents and principals have had to release statements and social media messages to reassure immigrant families.\n\n\"We're already hearing stories of parents keeping their children home from school and families avoiding church services,\" Vanessa Cárdenas, executive director of the pro-immigration reform America's Voice, said in an email statement, \"and we're hearing the worries of leaders from essential industries, concerned about what the loss of workers in agriculture, construction, and health care will do to their workforce and our broader economy.\"\n\nTo get the message across, the administration even had help from a TV personality. On Sunday, Phil McGraw, known as talk show host Dr. Phil, embedded with Trump's faithful border czar Tom Homan, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and other federal agents during operations in Chicago. \"It's a pretty high risk mission that we're going on,\" McGraw says in a video for his MeritTV network. \"This truly is a targeted ICE mission because they're not sweeping neighborhoods like people are trying to imply.\" (That day, ICE arrested 1,179 people nationwide, according to NBC News , almost half of whom were deemed \"criminal arrests.\")\n\nIn another excerpt, McGraw can be seen grilling a man over whether he had been charged with sex crimes or been deported before. Afterward, he went on television to parrot Homan's talking points , including that ICE's raids are focused on public safety threats and sanctuary cities are to blame for broader enforcement operations. \"Tom Homan's intention is, if you're in the country illegally,\" he said, \"you need to self-deport because if they catch you in the country illegally, you could be barred from coming back into the country before a number of years.\"\n\nBack in December, McGraw reportedly brokered a friendly meeting between Homan and New York City Mayor Eric Adams, after which, according to Gothamist , the Democrat said he would alter sanctuary city laws to give local authorities more latitude to cooperate with the federal government on immigration enforcement.\n\nIllinois Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin called McGraw an \"accomplice\" and said having the TV host tag along with ICE \"is dangerous and makes no sense.\"\n\nBut the objective was accomplished. It caused fear. Reports of ICE activity in Chicago-and elsewhere-promptly created anxiety among immigrant communities. Advocates told Politico residents had been calling since the early morning to share what they thought were sightings of immigration officials in their neighborhoods.\n\n\"This desire to popularize fear is unconscionable and abhorrent,\" Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson said during a press briefing on Tuesday. Referencing McGraw's stunt, he added: \"We're not entertained.\"\n\nThis happened days after the Trump administration rescinded guidance that previously limited ICE activity in or near so-called \"sensitive\" locations, such as hospitals, places of worship, and schools. Officials at a Chicago elementary school even mistakenly reported the presence of ICE officers, before it was clarified that they were actually US Secret Service agents investigating a threat against an unnamed government official.\n\nTrump and his aides will, no doubt, continue to try to ramp up and advertise arrests and deportations to quickly match the vision they sold of the largest deportation operation in US history. But they're fully aware of the constraints to accomplish even one million deportations a year, including funding, detention space, personnel, and the finite universe of immigrants with serious criminal records to target.\n\nKnowing they can't easily deliver on mass deportation, Trump will want to make the public believe-especially those who could be potentially impacted-they can remove anyone and everyone. That terror will have real consequences.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "\"The Entire System Will Collapse\": Inside the Purge of US Immigration Courts\n\nIsabela Dias March 6, 2025\n\nMother Jones illustration; Carolyn Kaster/AP, Elliot Spagat/AP\n\nMother Jones illustration; Carolyn Kaster/AP, Elliot Spagat/AP\n\nOn February 14, Kerry Doyle sat at the court in Chelmsford, Massachusetts, preparing for her new job as an immigration judge. She was excited to step into such a consequential position. Each year, immigration judges across the country decide whether hundreds of thousands of people should be allowed to stay in the United States or ordered deported. Often, they have the final word in whether to grant asylum seekers fleeing danger and persecution life-saving relief or sentence them to an uncertain fate elsewhere. \"You're there to be a neutral arbiter,\" she said, \"to apply the law and to give people their moments to tell their stories.\"\n\nDoyle-an experienced immigration lawyer and former deputy general counsel for immigration at the Department of Homeland Security-had been appointed by the Biden administration in December. She was set to join the ranks of the 735 or so immigration judges with the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), the Department of Justice's branch running the US immigration courts. The DOJ desperately needed more judges. The Chelmsford immigration court that Doyle was assigned to opened last year; it was set to alleviate the Boston court's ever-growing backlog of more than 160,000 cases.\n\n\"These judges are looking at it and thinking, if they're going to do this to my colleagues, who's next?\"\n\nBut Doyle never had the chance to do the work. On Valentine's Day-as the mentoring immigration judge she was shadowing wrapped up just shy of four in the afternoon-Doyle checked her laptop to find an email from EOIR's new acting director, Sirce E. Owen. It included an attachment labeled \"Termination.\" When Doyle opened the notice, it read: \"EOIR has determined that retaining you is not in the best interest of the agency.\" No further explanation given.\n\nDoyle was one in a class of 13 newly hired immigration judges dismissed that day as part of the Trump administration's purge of the immigration courts. The move, which mirrors sweeping firings hitting critical agencies across the federal government, risks plunging an already backed-up system deeper into chaos, relegating thousands of additional cases to linger for years in a colossal limbo of 3.6 million pending processes.\n\nThat same Friday, seven assistant chief immigration judges who led 18 courts and managed 135 judges in addition to hearing cases also lost their jobs . Two of them were military veterans. One of the assistant chief immigration judges who served in Texas and preferred to remain anonymous said they had completed more than 5,000 cases since 2021 with a high removal rate-94 percent-which they attributed to the court's location near the US-Mexico border.\n\nAs of early March, up to 28 people have been terminated. That includes 15 immigration judges, eight supervisory assistant chief immigration judges, and five senior managers, according to the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, a parent union of the National Association of Immigration Judges (NAIJ). Without them, some 10,000 hearings will no longer be held this year. (Each immigration judge takes on an average of 500 to 700 cases on an annual basis.)\n\n\"Of all of these firings that are occurring,\" says Matthew Biggs, the union's president, \"you would think the one place that would be spared would be the immigration courts.\" These judges play a critical part in the deportation machine the Trump administration hopes to max out in pursuit of an unprecedented mass expulsion campaign. Removal proceedings account for nearly all of EOIR's pending caseload, according to a recent Congressional Research Service report .\n\nBecause President Donald Trump ran on boosting immigration enforcement and speeding up deportations, making the adjudication of removal cases less efficient strikes Briggs as \"nonsensical.\" The staff terminations, he adds, also send a chilling message to the workforce: \"These judges are looking at it and thinking, if they're going to do this to my colleagues, who's next?\"\n\nIn addition to those who were fired, another 18 immigration judges and one assistant chief immigration judge are resigning or retiring early, according to information the union shared with Mother Jones . The union also estimates that as many as 60 EOIR staff members, some of whom directly support the work of immigration judges, such as interpreters and legal advisers, are voluntarily departing the agency.\n\n\"The actions taken by the Trump administration in the immigration court system so far show an administration that is more interested in settling scores than in actually increasing the volume of cases heard and resolved,\" Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a senior fellow with the American Immigration Council, posted on Bluesky. \"It also shows how much 'fire everyone' conflicts badly with 'deport everyone.'\"\n\nThe Trump administration has also reportedly taken aim at Biden appointees serving on the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA)-the body charged with reviewing immigration judges' decisions-by reducing the number of members from 28 to 15. As of January, the BIA's backlog reached a decade-high record of more than 127,000 pending cases, an almost eightfold increase compared to 2015.\n\nPaul Schmidt, a retired immigration judge and one-time BIA chairman, traced a parallel between the Trump administration's \"purge\" and a George W. Bush-era move to \"streamline\" the BIA. Back then, Attorney General John Ashcroft slashed the members perceived as pro-immigrant. The Department of Justice later found itself at the center of a scandal over senior officials' efforts to hire judges based on their political and ideological affiliations.\n\nSimilar politicization could be happening now. Prior to her unceremonious termination, Doyle had been flagged on a \"DHS Bureaucrat Watchlist\" by the American Accountability Foundation, a right-wing group backed by the Heritage Foundation. Last year, the organization announced an initiative called \"Project Sovereignty 2025\" to expose \"high-ranking civil servants within DHS and DOJ who are likely to thwart an incoming conservative administration's immigration agenda.\"\n\nThe website describes Doyle, who previously served as head prosecutor with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Office of the Principal Legal Advisor (OPLA), as an \"immigration activist lawyer\" with a \"known history as a critic of DHS\" and a \"lifelong commitment to open borders and mass migration.\" (It cites Doyle's involvement, while in private practice, in a lawsuit against the first Trump administration's infamous ban on travelers from Muslim-majority countries as evidence of her supposed ideological bias.)\n\n\"Significant time and resources went into hiring all of us and the group had a diverse background including a number of former OPLA prosecutors,\" Doyle, whose hiring process took 14 months between multiple rounds of interviews and an extensive background check, wrote in a LinkedIn post, \"but what we all had in common is that we were hired-through a neutral system I will point out-during the Biden administration. This firing was political.\"\n\nSchmidt, the former BIA chairman, predicts all of this is just the start: \"I think the worst is yet to come.\"\n\nThe shake-up in the immigration court system started right after Trump took office in January. On day one, the incoming administration fired four leading EOIR officials, including the agency's acting director, Mary Cheng, and chief immigration judge Sheila McNulty. (Combined, they had 100 years of government service.) One career senior executive official, Jill Anderson, joined the DOJ in 1999 and served through various administrations, earning glowing performance reviews. \"We were all very much caught off guard,\" she told Government Executive .\n\nLauren Alder Reid, former assistant director of EOIR's office of policy, had just watched Trump's inauguration ceremony on January 20 when, a couple of hours later, she received the termination email. \"It contained little text,\" she described on LinkedIn, \"but attached documents informing me that my apolitical career of nearly 20 years (6.5 years as a career senior executive) had come to an end.\" The reasoning given for Reid's firing was presidential power under Article II of the Constitution, the same authority invoked in a day-one executive order stating that top career officials \"must serve at the pleasure of the President.\"\n\nReid told ABC News she had been picked for the senior executive service by James McHenry-director of EOIR during the first Trump administration and more recently acting attorney general-who reportedly signed her and others' terminations. \"There is a lot of fear,\" Reid said of employees across EOIR and the DOJ. \"So, if fear is what is intended, I think that they're getting what they wanted. If they want a strong workforce who can act with autonomy within boundaries and who can really, truly serve the public...they're doing it wrong.\"\n\nIn an email, EOIR spokesperson Kathryn Mattingly said the agency \"declines to comment on personnel matters.\"\n\nAaron Aisen, a senior staff attorney with the Erie County Bar Association Volunteer Lawyers Project and liaison between the American Immigration Lawyers Association's New York chapter and EOIR, described the firing of one assistant chief immigration judge who served in Buffalo as a \"tragedy.\" Brandon Jaroch's responsibility, he said, \"was not to take our side or ICE's side, but to make sure the system worked. And he really did a good job of doing that.\" Jaroch was also a champion of a Friend of the Court orientation program to help unrepresented immigrants navigate legal proceedings.\n\n\"This firing was political,\" said Kerry Doyle, who was appinted as an immigration judge during the Biden administration and terminated by Trump.\n\n\"In my experience, it has been pretty unprecedented for any administration to wholesale fire people in the way that we're seeing now,\" says Ashley Tabaddor, who served as NAIJ president between 2017 and 2021. The very creation of EOIR in 1983 was rooted in a recognition of the need for adjudicators to be shielded from political influence, she explains. \"If you want somebody to be as impartial as possible, you cannot hold their job over their head.\"\n\nThe first Trump White House faced accusations of politicizing and weaponizing the immigration courts. In his first term, Trump imposed performance quotas to speed up deportations. His administration also picked judges with a prosecutorial and law enforcement background but no immigration experience-these officials disproportionately defaulted to ordering people deported. (The Biden administration later received criticism for selecting Trump's holdovers to the courts.)\n\nSources familiar with Sirce E. Owen, new Acting Director of EOIR, described her as a \"restrictionist loyalist\" with a reputation for denying cases.\n\nOther policies, like reopening cases and limiting judges' ability to more efficiently manage their caseloads by closing certain cases and taking them off the active docket, did little to ameliorate the backlog. Dozens of immigration judges retired early or stepped down during Trump's first four years, in no small part due to his overhaul of the courts. The system was already malfunctioning. Trump broke it.\n\nTrump's DOJ also petitioned the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) to decertify the NAIJ union, claiming immigration judges should be considered \"management officials\" and ineligible for representation. In late 2020, the Republican-controlled FLRA sided with the government, stripping immigration judges of their collective bargaining rights. More recently, the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 blueprint for a conservative administration advocated for folding EOIR into DHS and for treating \"the administrative law judges (immigration judges and Board of Immigration Appeals) as national security personnel.\" It also proposed, ironically, boosting hiring to process more cases.\n\n\"If they try to minimize due process and get people who think like them,\" says Tabaddor, \"everything is going to be interpreted in the light least favorable to the noncitizen...especially because the system as a whole is already built against them.\" The goal, she adds, \"is then to just maximize the numbers going through the system and to make sure that any case that can be denied is denied.\"\n\nThe Trump administration's reshaping of EOIR and its mission goes beyond personnel cuts. Almost immediately upon taking over the role as acting director of the agency, Sirce E. Owen announced a barrage of policy changes aimed at rescinding Biden-era practices and setting the tone for her leadership. On January 27, Owen sent out a five-page memo to all staff, to \"recommit to EOIR's core values and the rule of law.\"\n\nThe document states that the agency's guiding principles had been \"severely eroded\" during the previous administration and cites allegations of disparate treatment of employees, with so-called \"elites\" being favored. It goes on to say, without pointing to specific examples, that guidelines were \"based on specious, potentially unlawful, or otherwise problematic reasoning\" and \"at odds with current policies of the Executive Branch.\" EOIR Employees, Owen wrote, \"should not read policies obtusely or ridiculously, and all policies should be read with a modicum of common sense.\"\n\nOwen previously served as an appellate immigration judge and before that briefly as an assistant chief immigration judge in Atlanta, Georgia, where the immigration court has long been known as one of the most hostile to immigrants in the country. She also worked for several years as an ICE attorney. Sources familiar with Owen described her as a \"restrictionist loyalist\" with a reputation for denying cases. During her short stint as assistant chief immigration judge, Owen denied 38 out of 39 asylum cases that came before her, according to data from Mobile Pathways, a tech nonprofit helping immigrants access legal information.\n\n\"What disturbs me is the public vile and reprimand towards her department and staff,\" Carolina Antonini, an immigration lawyer in Atlanta, said in an email. \"I cannot imagine what this has done for their morale. This agency employs adults who, like the vast majority of federal workers, act in good faith...These [policy memoranda] address professional, responsible adults as if they were truant teens.\" Mother Jones reached out to Owen, but EOIR declined to comment.\n\nIn other memos a few days later, Owen invoked \"credible reports\" that under the Biden administration, immigration judges were pressured and \"tacitly threatened\" to \"rule in cases a certain way.\" She called the practice \"abhorrent\" and \"contrary to the law.\" EOIR, she wrote , had \"abandoned its traditional role as an impartial adjudicator and assumed the role of both an advocate and the prosecutor.\" Owen also issued a memo repealing a policy that encouraged immigration courts to adopt the Friend of the Court program. In another , she decried guidance meant to address the courts' language access issues as \"paternalistic and patronizing\" in tone.\n\n\"She is attacking prior policies that tried to bring the immigration courts into the 21 st century,\" says Charles Kuck, an Atlanta-based immigration lawyer, \"and reverting back to policies that made justice harder to render and harsher on the immigrants.\" In 2017, Kuck and the American Civil Liberties Union represented Mexican-born Jessica Colotl in a lawsuit against Owen and other Trump administration officials challenging the revocation of her Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status. \"I think their ultimate goal is to do away with immigration judges,\" he said.\n\nIn two February policy memos , Owen appears to cite precedent established by the Biden administration to justify the firings of judges and senior officials and indicates that \"for-cause removal restrictions\" could be disregarded \"if they are determined to be unconstitutional,\" essentially characterizing judges as at-will employees.\n\nMeanwhile, the Department of Justice's website is actively recruiting potential candidates for immigration judge positions. The number of immigration judges has almost tripled since 2015, but EOIR has consistently been understaffed due to funding and hiring challenges. The agency's budget request for 2025 included the addition of 25 new immigration judges, a far cry from the projected hundreds more needed to clear the backlog before 2032.\n\nBeing an immigration judge can be thankless work-hearing case after case from 8 in the morning until 4:30 in the afternoon with only half a day per week to do administrative tasks. \"To literally sit in a room all day and order people deported has got to canker your soul,\" Kuck says. \"That anybody would want that job is shocking to me and to fire people who were willing to do it with an open mind shows you exactly what this administration intends to do-limit due process and use the law as a weapon, not a shield.\"\n\nIn late February, two members of the NAIJ leadership announced they are stepping down as immigration judges: president Mimi Tsankov and Samuel B. Cole, the executive vice president. \"Honestly, it's a bit of a gut punch, and I feel a bit lost,\" Cole said in a letter to colleagues. \"These last eight years have been the realization of my lifelong ambition to be a judge...The professional reward of being an immigration judge, however, is soured by the environment in which all immigration judges work.\" Mentioning the \"bitter ping pong of immigration politics,\" he wrote, \"I hope that one day we will have the independence that this job requires.\" Although he doesn't know what's next, Cole concluded: \"It was just time to move on.\"\n\nThe changes at EOIR have been bad for morale, especially among the probationary judges. \"I think everybody has been on pins and needles,\" Doyle says. \"I don't really know who they think they're going to replace these people with.\" She fears if other immigration judges retire or quit the workforce altogether, \"the entire system will collapse.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Trampling Congress, Trump Attacks Immigration Legal Services\n\nPresident Donald Trump signs executive orders in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington on January 23, 2025. Yuri Gripas\n\nFollowing a flurry of anti-immigrant executive orders by Donald Trump on his first day in office, the Department of Justice sent emails last Wednesday ordering legal service providers in immigration courts to \"stop work immediately.\" The order was sent to organizations working within four federally funded programs designed to help people navigate the complex immigration court system, through assistance outside the courtroom-like going over legal paperwork and court date requirements-and inside the courtroom, through direct legal representation.\n\nThe day after the stop-work order was issued, members of the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights showed up at a detention facility in Virginia, hoping to provide services at their own expense despite the funding pause. \"Our team went to the facility in Virginia and then was escorted out about an hour into their work,\" says the organization's executive director, Michael Lukens, calling it \"a real blow, because our mission is to help people and we were being told that the government would not allow us to do that.\"\n\nOn Sunday, 11 days after the stop-work email went out, the DOJ restored funding for the programs after the Amica Center and eight other immigration rights organizations filed a lawsuit. But even though the programs are back, chaos and confusion spread-like with many of the administration's recent actions that courts have stepped in to temporarily halt-and there's no reason to believe Trump won't attempt something similar in the future.\n\nLukens says being shut out of the facilities made the detention centers \" de facto black sites\" with no transparency or accountability. I heard similar stories of disruption from another advocate speaking on condition of anonymity, who told me about one lawyer who was panicking about the fact that his client would age out of being able to apply for special immigrant juvenile status-which provides an opportunity for permanent residency to young people who suffer abuse or neglect by guardians-if he was unable to help him file his paperwork within a week.\n\nPeople facing deportation have no right to a public defender-immigration proceedings are considered a civil, rather than a criminal matter-which makes these legal support programs indispensable. It is estimated that nearly 70 percent of people facing deportation lack legal counsel, and as of the end of fiscal year 2024, there was a backlog of 3.6 million immigration cases in the United States.\n\nCongress has repeatedly increased funding for two programs affected by the \"stop-work\" order-a Legal Orientation Program and Immigration Court Helpdesk-with congressional appropriations committees arguing that the programs benefit taxpayers by making immigration proceedings more efficient. The Legal Orientation Program, which offers legal education and refers people to free or affordable counsel, has assisted hundreds of thousands since it was founded in 2003.\n\nIn 2018, during Trump's first term, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions froze funding for both programs, leading to public objections from Democratic members of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, which not only emphasized how the programs saved the government millions but also how Sessions' actions defied \" clear and unambiguous Congressional intent\" and ignored \"the will of Congress.\" Sessions eventually backtracked and restored funding after the congressional pushback.\n\nWhen Richard Nixon's administration attempted to withhold funds appropriated by Congress, as both Trump administrations now have, lower courts repeatedly struck down the attempts, and the Supreme Court eventually ruled 9-0 against him in a case, decided in 1975, involving the Nixon White House's effort to defund a program for mitigating water pollution.\n\nBettina Rodriguez Schlegel, chief of staff at immigrant rights organization Acacia Center for Justice, said via email that \"members of Congress from both sides of the aisle\" in both Republican and Democratic administrations \"have agreed that these vital programs help individuals better understand their rights and obligations while they are in immigration proceedings.\" She adds, \"Particularly as the administration announces plans to ramp up detention and enforcement operations around the country, it is more vital than ever that people have access to due process protections, afforded to everyone in the U.S - regardless of immigration status - under the Constitution.\"\n\nLukens sees the recent executive action to defund and ban immigration support as another clear violation of the constitutional \"power of the purse,\" a key plank of the Constitution which gives Congress power over how federal funds are spent. \"The executive branch is obligated to spend funds that have been appropriated,\" Lukens says. \"That's just basic constitutional law.\" His organization is moving forward with the lawsuit; he hopes for a verdict that will make those obligations even clearer, and prevent future attempts to bar immigrants from receiving legal services.\n\nThe White House and Justice Department did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "What Immigration Experts Want From a Harris Administration\n\nMother Jones illustration; Patrick Semansky/AP, Ivan Valencia/AP; Bryan Olin Dozier/NurPhoto/Zuma\n\nRepublicans have falsely labeled Kamala Harris as Joe Biden's \"border czar\" in their attempt to blame her for the number of migrant crossings- which is decreasing . It's a label Donald Trump used in last week's debate, in between his multiple hateful, lie-filled rants about immigrants .\n\nIn reality, Harris' role was mostly limited to addressing the root causes of migration from El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras through task forces focused on corruption and smuggling, and by working with the private sector to expand economic opportunities. That increased collaboration is generally viewed favorably by immigration advocates-but Harris' focus on deterrence-based policies at the border has been criticized. As the Democratic nominee, she has come out in favor of the bipartisan immigration bill championed by Joe Biden, which would, among other things, allow the Department of Homeland Security to suspend most access to asylum outside of ports of entry when border encounters reach a certain level.\n\nI think the hope is that overall, she'll be taking a much more humanistic approach to immigration.\n\nAdriel D. Orozco is a senior policy counsel at the American Immigration Council, which works to improve the immigration system. He believes that cutting off access to asylum based on the number of migrant encounters is the wrong approach to solving the problems of a strained and under-resourced system. Orozco does support the Biden administration's use of parole to allow people to stay in the United States while they seek residency-he hopes to see Harris continue the practice. I spoke with him about Harris' approach to tackling immigration challenges as a senator and as vice president, and what advocates hope to see from her administration if she becomes the 47th president.\n\nRepublicans have falsely billed Harris as Biden's \"border czar.\" What do you think is the basis?\n\nI think that there [were] some inaccurate representations of her work from the beginning: A lot of the headlines that were coming out at the time were focused on her addressing immigration generally, and White House officials said that she would oversee a whole government approach to dealing with immigration. There was a lot of confusion.\n\nWhat was Harris' actual role in the Biden administration when it came to immigration policy?\n\nPresident Biden announced at a press conference that Vice President Harris would take on a diplomatic campaign to address the root causes [of migration] from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador. The idea was to think about why folks were leaving that region. She was tasked with increasing public and private sector investment in the area to strengthen the economies. She was also trying to figure out ways to address corruption within the government and address some of the smuggling and human trafficking networks.\n\nBut from the beginning, it was meant to be a long-term strategy. It wasn't meant for her to be focused on the border policy. That was always under the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas.\n\nWhat were the specific goals of the \"Root Causes Strategy\"?\n\nReally thinking about [the] problems that are occurring in these Northern Triangle countries that are impacting people's livelihoods and pressuring them to leave the region. She wanted to increase investment, particularly from the private sector, but also investment from other entities like the UN and USAID. Part of it was trying to address some of the networks that were being established around drug trafficking, human trafficking, [and] human smuggling, that were also leading to increased migration levels in the region.\n\nDid the strategy represent a departure from that of previous administrations ?\n\nIt depends on which administration, but there's always been an attempt to try to provide investments in the region to support local economies. It was a pretty clear departure from the Trump administration, which was primarily trying to bolster the enforcement mechanisms within these countries to stop migration. So this was a departure in the sense that it was trying to look more broadly, not just from an enforcement and deterrence lens, but also about why people [are] coming.\n\nHas it been successful?\n\nThat's a little bit difficult to pinpoint. There are things that one can point to to say that it was successful. Vice President Harris and the Biden-Harris administration have pointed out that they secured more than $5 billion in private-sector investment in the region. They established a task force to try to create more collaboration between Mexico and these Northern Triangle countries to try to address smuggling and human trafficking. Generally speaking, there are lower numbers of migrants coming from that region, but there are many other reasons why that could be, particularly Mexico preventing them from getting to the US-Mexico border [and] some changes in El Salvador around security issues. So it's hard to say, but it is important to create more regional cooperation. You can't really just stop it border by border.\n\nShe tries to take a humanistic lens to migration, considering her background as a child of migrants, but she's also a prosecutor.\n\nWhat was Harris like in the Senate regarding immigration policy?\n\nShe is probably most well known for her ability to almost cross-examine Trump administration officials, particularly around the \"zero-tolerance\" policy that led to the separation of families at the border. More than 3,000 children were separated from their parents. In terms of policy, she was a vocal proponent of the DACA program and criticized the Trump administration when it rescinded the program. She also advocated for pathways for citizenship and was willing to take the administration head-on when she saw that [it] was doing real harm to immigrant communities.\n\nWhat would your organization like to see from a Harris administration if she wins ?\n\nWe would like to see a shift away [from] primarily relying on deterrence and enforcement policy at the border. We think immigration needs to be thought about more holistically. Unfortunately, we've seen, from the Biden-Harris administration, a rightward shift in its policy proposals. Particularly the Senate bipartisan bill that both Biden and Harris supported trying to cut off access to asylum as a means to deter migrants. And we think that that's the wrong approach.\n\nFrom what I've read and seen from Vice President Harris, I think she tries to take a balanced approach. She tries to take a humanistic lens to migration, considering her background as a child of migrants, but she's also a prosecutor. She also sees the importance of enforcing the law and protecting vulnerable communities, so we think that there's a prime opportunity for her to become much more of a vocal supporter of increasing pathways for individuals, so that they don't have to make the treacherous journey to the United States border.\n\nIt was difficult to see that the bipartisan Senate bill was largely focused on trying to shut off access to asylum at the border. [We need] the proper balance of saying we need to have security at the border, but also that the folks who have been in the United States for a long time deserve a dignified process to becoming citizens.\n\nWhat changes would you like to see to the asylum system in the United States?\n\nThe Senate border bill wasn't all bad. Our organization thinks that there were some components that made sense. One was to make the asylum process non-adversarial. So, right now, the overwhelming majority of migrants are unable to get an attorney to represent them in immigration court proceedings, but the government is always represented by their government attorney. So if you're able to have trained asylum officers, where it's non-adversarial, you give people more of an opportunity to present their stories, and if they qualify to be in the United States, they can stay.\n\nOne of our concerns with heavy-handed deterrence-based policies is that a lot of people are being sent back into harm's way, when internationally, we have obligations to protect people from being placed back in harm's way. The unfortunate thing for the Biden-Harris administration is that they have not been able to get the resources they need to address the larger [number] of individuals who had been presenting at the border.\n\nWhat we've seen from her previous work is that she tries to be pragmatic.\n\nAnd so they have been placed in an impossible situation by Congress, particularly conservatives who decided that they did not want to fund the systems that exist now. The system is broken in a myriad of ways, not just the laws that exist but also the fact that our Congress is unwilling to actually fund the laws that exist.\n\nWhen it comes to undocumented people already living in the United States, what do you think the Harris administration should do?\n\nWe do believe that the pathway to citizenship for immigrants who have been in the United States for a long time should be something she advocates for. I think it's difficult to see, without a fundamental change in the makeup of Congress, how she would be able to actually get that passed. A lot of the tools that the Biden administration has been using, a Harris administration can use, [like] temporary protected status as a means to protect more populations in the United States.\n\nHas Harris signaled any potential changes from the Biden administration on immigration policy?\n\nWe have heard from her speeches that she is supporting the bipartisan border bill and that she would advocate for it if she is able to win. Generally, she has said that she supports a pathway to citizenship. But we haven't really received specifics on other policies. I do think that given her involvement with the Biden administration, she would take a similar approach around parole and TPS [Temporary Protected Status].\n\nHow do you view Harris' recent move towards a more aggressive approach to campaigning on immigration?\n\nI think it is good to see her out there taking a stronger approach to rhetoric and really trying to shape the narrative. Obviously, she has a strong position, given Donald Trump's involvement in making sure that the bipartisan bill didn't move through Congress, but she is adopting the language of Republicans around crime and protection.\n\nIt fits with her role as a prosecutor-so part of it is politics, trying to meet folks who are concerned about the border and security, given the years of fear-mongering around that issue. I think what we've seen from her previous work is [that] she tries to be pragmatic. I'm sure that she's trying to think about how you have rules in place while still honoring the folks who have been here for long periods of time without authorization.\n\nIt is a little bit concerning that the Democratic Party has adopted that language, but I think the hope is that overall, she'll be taking a much more humanistic approach to immigration. And her opponent, his campaign's rhetoric around immigration is just horrific- trying to use the military and the National Guard to round up migrants . So Vice President Harris is looking like the reasonable person in the room, even though, if [you] compare her to four years ago, she would probably be very much to the right in that rhetoric.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Activate your online access\n\nProject 2025 lays out a vision of a new immigration enforcement agency that will be more effective than ever in deporting, detaining, and denying entry to immigrants.\n\nThis article is part of \" Project 2025: The Plot Against America ,\" a Nation special issue devoted to unpacking the right's vast and chilling program for a second Trump term.\n\nThe chapter on the Department of Homeland Security in Project 2025's Mandate for Leadership , written in part by Ken Cuccinelli-who notoriously served as the acting director of US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) under President Trump-lays out a vision of an immigration enforcement agency that is even more draconian than its previous incarnation, one that will be purged of personnel who aren't loyal to Trump and will be far less subject to oversight. Under the plan , the DHS would be dismantled, and immigration-related agencies from across the executive branch would be combined into \"a stand-alone border and immigration agency\" (except for the Transportation Security Administration, which would be privatized). Abolishing the DHS and starting from scratch would give the Trump administration an opportunity to oust anyone in the department who could pose a threat to the other plans laid out by Project 2025-such as the people who, during Trump's first term, spoke out against policies like the asylum ban. This, the chapter notes, would require an act of Congress, as would many of the other recommendations delineated over the next 34 pages. But that could be less unlikely than it seems if Republicans take the Senate and hold on to the House this November.\n\nStill, as Mandate lays out, there's plenty that can be done without congressional approval. For better or worse, the Supreme Court has granted the executive branch broad discretion when it comes to immigration. This was, after all, how Trump accomplished most of his immigration policies, from the Muslim ban to family separation. During a second Trump term, executive authority would be used to deport as many people as possible: Project 2025 calls on Immigration and Customs Enforcement to expand \"expedited removal,\" a speedy deportation process for people apprehended within 100 miles of the border, to cover the entire country. ICE would lose much of its leeway to be able to deem cases \"administratively closed,\" as it sometimes does for people it determines aren't a priority for removal. The agency would be required to detain most noncitizens with criminal records and almost entirely eliminate its \"Alternatives to Detention\" program, in which people in deportation proceedings are tracked in lieu of incarceration.\n\nLegal immigration would also be curtailed: Several visa categories would be reduced or eliminated altogether, including so-called T and U visas, which are issued to victims of trafficking and other crimes who help police investigate the perpetrators of said crimes.\n\nAsylum, too, would be gutted. The plan includes a new authority that would allow the DHS to expel migrants whenever there has been what it calls a \"loss of operational control of the border.\" Migrants who do manage to ask for asylum would likely be sent to other countries, because the proposal calls for reviving Trump-era border policies like \"Remain in Mexico\" and the \"asylum cooperative agreements\" with Central American nations.\n\nPeople who are currently in the United States but lack permanent status-including people with temporary protected status and the hundreds of thousands of Afghans, Ukrainians, Venezuelans, Cubans, Nicaraguans, and Haitians recently admitted to the country under humanitarian parole-could have their status rescinded.\n\nUnder a second Trump administration, USCIS officers would be retrained to focus on \"fraud detection rather than speed in processing.\" Slow processing times would be used against migrants and prospective immigrants alike; the chapter suggests that, until the agency catches up on its backlog of cases, anyone whose application is rejected would be required to \"leave the U.S. immediately,\" eliminating any possibility of appealing the decision or reapplying from inside the country. USCIS would also increase the cost of all applications, implement fees for asylum petitions, and expand the \"premium\" processing track that would let people pay more to skip the line.\n\nCongress hasn't passed a major immigration law in decades , and the most recent attempt, which included plenty of restrictive policies that could have been plucked straight from the Heritage Foundation's wish list, failed because Republicans refused to give President Biden a \"victory\" on immigration. Under Trump, the inverse would likely occur: Democrats who supported Biden's attempted crackdown at the border would refuse to vote to codify policies backed by Trump. But Democratic opposition may be stymied if Republicans assume legislative control this November. With Congress on board, there is far more that Project 2025 envisions for Trump's second term. The DHS chapter in Mandate calls on Congress to pass a bill that allocates additional funding for ICE agents to arrest immigrants living in the US; for the attorneys who argue for their deportations; and for more beds in immigrant detention facilities. To ensure that those beds are filled, the document also suggests that Congress change the law to state that noncitizens in deportation proceedings \"shall\" be detained. (Right now, the statute says immigrants \"may\" be detained, a stipulation few presidents have used with restraint.)\n\nProject 2025 also proposes that Congress limit asylum eligibility for those hoping to find refuge in the US. It calls for raising the standard for what counts as a \"credible fear,\" the initial bar that migrants must clear as part of their asylum applications; codifying Trump-era barriers to asylum; and eliminating certain categories for asylum eligibility, which the Trump administration interpreted narrowly so as to exclude victims of domestic violence and people targeted by gangs.\n\nAs Mandate makes clear, Project 2025 also intends to make it easier to detain children in awful conditions. It calls on Congress to rescind the court settlement agreement that requires unaccompanied minors to be held in the \"least restrictive setting\" possible. Instead, large numbers of them could again be held in ICE detention. And those children would be deported more expeditiously too, since Project 2025 recommends that Congress repeal a section of the law that guarantees certain protections for migrant children.\n\nEach of these policies would do significant damage on its own. Together, they'd affect tens of millions of people. As of late 2023, there were nearly 700,000 people with temporary protected status and 530,110 DACA recipients living in the US. Since he took office, Biden has admitted more than 1 million people from Ukraine, Afghanistan, Venezuela, Nicaragua, Cuba, and Haiti into the country, albeit temporarily. The policies would also be disastrous for the more than 12 million people with green cards, not to mention the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants who have made lives here despite their lack of status.\n\nCrucially, this would all happen with limited oversight. Expulsions during \"mass migrations,\" for example, would \"not be subject to the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act,\" a law that prohibits capricious rulemaking. During Trump's first term, many of his policies were scrapped not because of their discriminatory intent or horrific outcomes, but because they violated the APA. With four years to prepare, however-and a federal judiciary stacked in Trump's favor-it looks like a second Trump term wouldn't succumb to such pitfalls again.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Activate your online access\n\nAnti-immigrant think tanks and advocacy groups operated on the margins until Trump became president. Now they have molded not only the GOP but also Democrats in their image.\n\nOn one of his few lucid moments during the only debate of the 2024 election cycle between Donald Trump and Joe Biden, the sitting president suggested he would be tougher on the border than his predecessor, blaming the former president for the demise of a \"bipartisan border deal\" that would have boosted the Border Patrol's funding and significantly reduced access to asylum. Biden and top congressional Democrats had spent months negotiating its provisions, granting more and more concessions to conservatives in the hopes that they'd stop claiming that Biden had lost control of the southern border. But \"when we had that deal done,\" Biden said, Trump \"called his Republican colleagues and said, 'Don't do it. It's going to hurt me politically.'\" The far right had refused to grant Biden a \"win\" on immigration, even if it meant forgoing exactly what they claimed they wanted.\n\nThis was a very different Biden than the one who had gone up against Trump four years earlier. When the two shared a debate stage in 2020, Biden accused Trump of presiding over unimaginable cruelty toward migrants: babies torn from their mothers' arms at the border, some never to be reunited; undocumented workers rounded up on the job; asylum seekers shunted back to Mexico without a hearing. But there Biden was, a little over three months ago, saying in effect that he'd tried to finish the job Trump had begun, only to be stymied by Trump himself.\n\nBiden's pronouncements would soon take a backseat to the flurry of concern over his pitiful debate performance and his visibly declining health. He soon dropped out of the race, passing the torch to Vice President Kamala Harris, whom he'd once tasked with addressing the \"root causes\" of migration from Central America. But Biden's pivot in the debate and the months preceding it symbolized a rightward lurch on immigration that may have been initiated by the GOP but has since become the dominant position of the Democratic Party. Meanwhile, in his campaign to get back to the White House, Trump has tacked even further to the right. Immigrants, Trump has said, are \"poisoning the blood of our country.\" If elected, he's declared to thunderous applause, he'll begin \"mass deportations\" on day one. \"Send them back!\" the crowd chanted when \" illegal aliens\" were mentioned at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, holding signs that read \"Mass Deportation Now!\"\n\nThis shift came stunningly fast. Just three election cycles ago, in the aftermath of Mitt Romney's loss in the 2012 election, a postmortem by the Republican National Committee (RNC) attributed Romney's defeat to his poor performance among Latino voters and recommended that the party should become more inclusive, perhaps softer on immigration. Even Trump-at the time an outspoken businessman with no public political ambitions-said that Romney's stance on immigration was ridiculous. \"He had a crazy policy of self-deportation, which was maniacal,\" Trump said in 2012 . \"It sounded as bad as it was, and he lost all of the Latino vote. He lost the Asian vote. He lost everybody who is inspired to come into this country.\" Three years later, announcing his own run for president, Trump descended a gilded escalator at Trump Tower on Fifth Avenue and promised to build an impenetrable border wall. Throughout his 2016 campaign, Trump ignored the RNC's recommendations and embraced the ethos of the Tea Party, channeling incoherent populist rage into a nativist platform.\n\nThe promises of mass deportations and a \"big, beautiful wall\" were all Trump, but a policy wonk he was not. Trump's immigration policy was devised by the alumni and allies of a single ecosystem of intertwined think tanks, nonprofits, and advocacy groups-one that once operated largely on the margins but that, beginning with Trump's ascension to the presidency, has set the tone of the national immigration debate. Few of Trump's immigration policies survived legal challenge, and even fewer are still in place today. Congress didn't pass a single immigration bill during Trump's term, nor has it under Biden. But immigration restriction is now dogma among Republicans and Democrats alike. The choice is no longer between a party that wants to turn away migrants and one that claims to welcome them, but rather between opposing sides that, despite their broader differences, disagree only on the best way to \"secure\" the border at any cost.\n\nIt's not an overstatement to say that the modern immigration restriction movement owes its existence to one man: a charismatic eye doctor from rural Michigan named John Tanton. Once described by a former ally as \"the most influential unknown man in America,\" Tanton spent decades building a network of anti-immigration groups from the ground up, transforming post-World War II nativism from a fringe view held by a small group of white supremacists into a mainstream political movement. Tanton, a veteran of the mid-century conservationist and population control movements, saw population growth as a major hurdle to long-term sustainability. Trying to convince his fellow nature lovers of the connection between international migration and environmental ruin, Tanton founded the Federation for American Immigration Reform, or FAIR, in 1979, dedicating himself to reversing the demographic changes that had taken hold in America in his lifetime. Over the next three decades, Tanton would found and help provide funding for a constellation of anti-immigration advocacy groups, including the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), U.S. English, and NumbersUSA.\n\nTanton was born in Detroit in 1934, a decade after the Immigration Act of 1924 put the first permanent numerical limits on immigration in US history. The legislation capped immigration from Europe and allocated slots using a quota based on the composition of Americans' national origins as of the 1890 census. The effect was an immediate and drastic reduction in immigration from Southern and Eastern Europe: More than a million European immigrants arrived in the United States in 1907; in 1925, that figure was just over 160,000. As a result of the act, Southern and Eastern Europe were no longer the main source of immigrants to the US. (African and Asian migration were effectively banned; no restrictions were implemented on migration from Latin America.)\n\nThe 1924 law kept America overwhelmingly white and Western European through Tanton's young adulthood. But in 1965, a year after he graduated medical school, the country changed forever. The Immigration Act of 1965, also known as the Hart-Celler Act, overturned the national-origins quota system, replacing it with one that prioritized family reunification. The new law more than doubled the number of immigrant visas issued each year and didn't count the immediate relatives of US citizens against these quotas. At the same time, Hart-Celler imposed numerical limits on Latin American and Caribbean migration for the first time in US history, unwittingly creating the conditions for a rise in unauthorized migration decades later. The law led to new patterns of immigration that slowly shifted America's racial composition. The descendants of the Southern and Eastern European immigrants who had been considered unassimilable decades earlier were, after a rocky start, incorporated into the American melting pot; the newcomers, meanwhile, were regarded with hostility, accused of being inferior to the generation of immigrants who had come before them.\n\nAs was the case at the turn of the 20th century, the wave of immigrants who arrived after 1965 were met with hostility. In 1977, David Duke, the grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan, said that he and his followers would be patrolling the US-Mexico border in search of migrants. Two years later, Klan members descended on a Texas fishing village that had recently become home to Vietnamese refugees.\n\nTanton and his wife were mostly insulated from these changes in Petoskey, the tiny northern Michigan town where he found work as an ophthalmologist. A decade earlier, at the end of the 1960s, Tanton had read The Population Bomb , the biologist Paul Ehrlich's polemic on overpopulation. For Tanton, each refugee who resettled in America meant another drain on resources, another blight on the environment. He conceived of FAIR as a liberal anti-immigration group, and its early talking points were about how unfettered immigration hurt working-class people of color at home and contributed to a brain drain abroad, not to mention its effects on population growth.\n\nAll these decades later, it's hard to grasp how out of step this was. After Hart-Celler and before FAIR's emergence as a major political player, immigration restriction was the domain of Klansmen and white separatists. It wasn't, as Tanton wrote in his 1978 funding request to Cordelia Scaife May-the reclusive Mellon heiress who would go on to bankroll his movement-\"a legitimate position for thinking people.\"\n\nThe first test arrived quickly. Months after FAIR's founding, Congress began working on the Refugee Act of 1980, an effort to streamline the ad hoc system that allowed people fleeing their countries to find protection in the United States. FAIR hired a lobbyist to push for a provision that would cap the number of refugees admitted each year at 50,000. Instead, the bill that President Jimmy Carter signed into law allowed the sitting president to choose the annual limit in consultation with Congress. That year, more than 207,000 refugees were resettled in the United States. Six years later, FAIR once again got caught up in-and lost-a legislative battle, this time over the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, which provided a path to citizenship for nearly 3 million undocumented immigrants living in the US. The bill passed with bipartisan consensus, and President Ronald Reagan signed it into law. Few in Congress were swayed by FAIR's arguments for deporting unauthorized immigrants. \"We didn't convince anybody,\" founding member Otis Graham told The New York Times in 2011. FAIR had built a membership base of 4,000 by 1982, but it wasn't enough for Tanton, who, according to notes taken during a board meeting that year, believed it was \"time to change our methods.\" Tanton was realizing that environmental issues didn't appeal to most Americans; what did was watching their communities change and feeling powerless to stop it. In a 1986 memo, Tanton wrote that FAIR had been too reliant on large donors and too focused on lobbying members of Congress, with little to show for it. Instead, he outlined a \"long-range project\" to \"infiltrate\" congressional immigration committees. \"Think how much different our prospects would be if someone espousing our ideas had the chairmanship!\" he wrote. Until then, it would be difficult to influence national politics. Tanton decided to start small.\n\nTanton got his first chance to test his new theory of the power of a grassroots immigration restriction movement in 1988, when another organization he'd founded earlier that decade, U.S. English, placed the question of language on the ballot. Tanton had created U.S. English to help organize campaigns to make English the official language of several states, some of which had large and steadily growing Latino populations. The crusade began in California, where U.S. English bankrolled a local group's efforts in support of an English-only ballot initiative. After the California measure succeeded, U.S. English led similar campaigns in a far-flung mix of states, including Arkansas, Mississippi, North Carolina, North Dakota, and South Dakota in 1987, and Arizona, Colorado, and Florida the following year. Some were states where the demographics were shifting, while others, like North Dakota, were trying to preempt these changes. In all, however, the question was about more than language; it was about who belonged in America-and to whom it should belong in the future.\n\nThe English-only campaigns were marred by allegations of racism from the outset. Opponents criticized Tanton's groups for taking money from the Pioneer Fund, a New York-based eugenicist organization. But it wasn't until someone leaked a memo from Tanton written two years earlier that the Arizona campaign seemed doomed. \"Can homo contraceptivus compete with homo progenitiva if borders aren't controlled?\" he mused in the 1986 memo , which was distributed to attendees of the annual anti-immigration retreat he had begun hosting a year earlier. \"Or is advice to limit one's family simply advice to move over and let someone else with greater reproductive powers occupy the space?\" He posed other troubling questions in the memo: Will Latino Catholics be able to assimilate to American culture? Will they bring their customs of bribery, violence, and disregard for authority to the United States? And why do they have so many kids in the first place?\n\nThe people who attended Tanton's retreat-including Jared Taylor, the publisher of the white nationalist journal American Renaissance -must have welcomed these questions, but the public didn't. Despite U.S. English's bipartisan background and high-profile endorsements-its first director was former Reagan aide and prominent Latina activist Linda Chavez, and Walter Cronkite was on the board-it could no longer claim plausible deniability regarding allegations of racism. Chavez resigned after the memo leaked and disavowed the organization; Cronkite, too, bailed. But with the help of a last-minute canvassing push funded by May, U.S. English eked out a victory, with 50.5 percent of Arizona voters supporting the measure. The elections weren't as close elsewhere in the country: More than 60 percent of Colorado's voters supported the amendment, as did 84 percent of Florida's.\n\nThere was a setback: A federal judge later blocked Arizona's English-only measure. Even so, grassroots activism, Tanton came to understand, was the key to enacting policies that curtail immigration. All Tanton had to do was help people realize what they already knew in their hearts to be true: America was a nation of immigrants, yes, but the newcomers were unlike those who came before. \"I think there is such a thing as an American culture, however difficult it may be to define,\" Tanton said in a 1989 oral history of his advocacy. Some could argue that \"hyphenated Americans\" belong to this culture just as much as people whose forebears date back to the colonial period, Tanton said, but that was \"an incorrect view.\" In a 1986 interview with The New York Times , FAIR's first executive director, Roger Conner, a former environmental lawyer, described previous waves of immigrants as \"entrepreneurial,\" while more recent arrivals had little interest in working or assimilating. \"For some reason,\" Conner said, \"Mexican immigrants are not succeeding as well as other groups.\"\n\nBy 1990, FAIR claimed to have 50,000 members, and the organization was finding other state-level initiatives to support. In 1994, the group backed Proposition 187, a ballot initiative in California that banned undocumented immigrants from using any government services in the state, including public schools and non-emergency healthcare. In 1986, Tanton had written that California's system could do this, \"but the political will is lacking to implement it.\" To build that will, Tanton created and funded groups like Americans for Border Control through his umbrella organization, U.S. Inc. Proposition 187's supporters claimed that not only were the undocumented overburdening public services and contributing to overcrowding in the state, but their presence in California would lead to long-term gains in political power for Hispanic Americans.\n\nNearly 60 percent of Californians voted for Proposition 187, but a federal judge blocked the initiative from going into effect. Still, as with Arizona's English-only measure, the defeat of Proposition 187 provided a valuable lesson for FAIR: Change happens when ordinary people decide they're fed up with something and come together to do something about it. If the groups that allow people to do that don't exist, why not create them?\n\nEverywhere they passed, anti-immigrant ordinances like Proposition 187 and the English-only measures granted a degree of legitimacy to long-held racial animus. In Colorado, someone posted a sign reading \" No Ingles, No Travato \"-an attempted translation of \"No English, No Job\"-at the entrance to a construction site. \"We checked. Because of the English-only bill, we know it's legal,\" a superintendent at the site told the Los Angeles Times . In California, Proposition 187 proved to be just as effective a recruitment tool as it would have been had it been implemented. Tanton's journal, The Social Contract , has published dozens of articles about Proposition 187 in the decades since the referendum passed. \"When thousands of [people] marched to protest\" the measure, an article from The Social Contract 's 1996 issue on so-called \"anchor babies\" declared, \"they carried the flag of Mexico, not the Stars and Stripes.\"\n\nTanton's organizations not only activated dormant anti-immigrant feeling; they actively fomented it, often using the news media to launder their talking points. FAIR, the Center for Immigration Studies, and NumbersUSA-the latter founded in 1996 by Tanton's acolyte Roy Beck-became reporters' go-to sources for all things related to immigration restriction, largely because there were few other groups to quote. Representatives of the three organizations blamed nearly every problem, from littering in public parks to gridlock on the highways, on immigration. At the height of the tough-on-crime '90s, immigration was being portrayed as a gangs and quality-of-life issue; after the September 11 attacks, the permeability of the border became a national security threat.\n\nFAIR and its allies were succeeding in changing public sentiment on immigration. Soon FAIR, through its legal arm, the Immigration Law Reform Institute, began offering its legal services to local governments. In 2006, when the city of Hazleton, Pennsylvania, passed a law fining landlords for renting apartments to undocumented immigrants and employers for using them as workers, it hired Kris Kobach, who would become one of the foremost attorneys pushing immigration restriction. Not long after, the town council of Valley Park, Missouri, unanimously voted to implement a similar policy. Kobach defended Valley Park after a landlord sued over the measure, then went on to draft legislation for other cities-and defended the cities when those policies were challenged in court. The measures faced years of lawsuits, and the cities had to pay Kobach hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees. \"It was a sham,\" the mayor of Farmers Branch, a Texas city that hired Kobach in 2007, told ProPublica , which reported that Kobach earned at least $800,000 for his legal and advocacy work over a 13-year period. Ineffective and expensive as they were, the ordinances helped cement Kobach's status as the go-to lawyer for local and state governments that wanted to take a hard line on immigration. In 2010, Kobach drafted Arizona's infamous SB 1070, colloquially referred to as the \"Show Me Your Papers\" law. An Arizona state senator later described it as \"model legislation\" for dissemination through the American Legislative Exchange Council , a right-wing \"bill mill.\" Copycat bills were soon introduced around the country. By 2012, Kobach was informally advising the Romney campaign on immigration.\n\nMost of the bills that Kobach drafted or defended were blocked by the courts, never implemented, or watered down to the point of meaninglessness. But every city that passed or even debated an anti-immigrant ordinance helped Tanton's groups send a message to Congress: Americans aren't interested in immigration reform or amnesty for the undocumented; they want those people out. \"God forbid he ever gets hit by a Mack truck or something,\" the Immigration Law Reform Institute's general counsel said in 2012 of Kobach, who by that point was working for the group on the side while serving as Kansas's secretary of state. \"It would change the course of history.\"\n\nTanton's \"long-range project\" to affect national politics by starting at the local level was working. The organizations under the umbrella of FAIR and U.S. Inc. had built a grassroots army and won over small-town mayors. And some of those mayors were now entering national politics. After three failed bids for a seat in Congress, Lou Barletta, the Hazleton mayor who hired Kobach to defend the city's anti-immigrant ordinance, was elected to the House of Representatives in 2010. Among Tanton's other supporters were Colorado Representative Tom Tancredo, who kicked off his first term in 1999 by founding the Congressional Immigration Reform Caucus; Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley; and Jeff Sessions, the soft-spoken Alabama senator whose diminutive presence belied his virulent racism. In 2000, FAIR and its sister organizations helped defeat the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act, which would have provided a path to citizenship for qualifying undocumented immigrants. The following year, in the immediate aftermath of 9/11, the Congressional Immigration Reform Caucus's membership nearly doubled overnight, from 16 to 30 members.\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJeet Heer\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nFAIR would face its biggest tests yet beginning in 2006, when Congress appeared poised to pass a bill granting green cards to more than 6 million undocumented immigrants. The legislation failed, but in 2007 a group of senators once again attempted to persuade their colleagues-and the nation-to support immigration reform. The bill sponsored by the \"Gang of 12,\" including Lindsey Graham and John McCain, had bipartisan support and was backed by President George W. Bush. Its opponents had something stronger: a grassroots army, hundreds of thousands strong, who threatened to withhold their votes from politicians who put \"illegals\" ahead of Americans.\n\nMost Americans, in fact, were in favor of granting citizenship to undocumented immigrants who met certain conditions-but they, too, were swayed by the campaign against the bill. Polls found that many voters who agreed with the 2007 bill's provisions opposed the idea of \"amnesty\" and the bill specifically. The discrepancy between what people said they wanted and what they actually supported was the result of a coordinated effort by FAIR, CIS, and NumbersUSA. Every day, as part of a campaign led by NumbersUSA, lawmakers received thousands of calls, letters, and faxes urging them to vote against the bill. \"The fax machines would run out of paper,\" a Republican House staffer recalled years later . Most of the messages came from a familiar group of people-\"frequent fliers,\" the staffer called them-but the volume of calls swayed those who were undecided. The callers \"lit up the switchboard for weeks,\" Senator Mitch McConnell, who voted against the bill, said in 2011, when immigration reform was back on the table. \"And to every one of them I say today: Your voice was heard.\"\n\nThe 2011 bill failed as well and was reintroduced in 2014, this time by a \"Gang of Eight\"-a sign of waning support in Congress. \"The longer it stays in the sun, the more it smells, as they say about the mackerel,\" Sessions said of the reform bill in 2014. Certain that it would pass in the Senate, Sessions-at the time still a fringe member of his party-set his sights on tanking the bill in the House. To ensure that the legislation failed, he enlisted his young aide, a 29-year-old from California named Stephen Miller.\n\nMiller-the son of Santa Monica liberals who would introduce himself to college classmates by saying, \"My name is Stephen Miller, I'm from Los Angeles, and I like guns\"-started his career as a press secretary for Minnesota Representative Michelle Bachmann. After he took a job with Sessions, Miller became close with researchers at CIS; he used the group's data to convince other Republicans of the harms that immigrants posed. Sessions had long been close with FAIR and CIS, but with Miller's help, he became a leader of the anti-immigration-reform movement within Congress and was instrumental in defeating the bill in 2014. \"The whole point was to taint the bill in the eyes of Republicans in the House,\" CIS president Mark Krikorian told Miller's biographer. \"Sessions, with Miller's help, really did succeed in preventing that bill from passing.\"\n\nMiller, too, was influenced by Tanton, sometimes in obscure ways. In 1983, Tanton persuaded May, his billionaire patron, to cover the costs of reprinting and distributing The Camp of the Saints , a French novel that depicts a dystopian future in which Europe and the US are besieged by hordes of dark-skinned migrants. The book didn't receive much acclaim outside white supremacist circles when it was first published in 1973. But Tanton acquired the rights and arranged for it to be published through the Social Contract Press. It's unclear when Miller read the novel, but in September 2015, he persuaded Breitbart to run a story about it, according to e-mails obtained by the Southern Poverty Law Center. \"I think it was growing up in California, he saw the role that mass migration played in turning a red state blue,\" a former Senate colleague of Miller's told Politico . \"He was fearful that would happen to the rest of the country.\"\n\nAfter Trump announced his candidacy in 2015 by calling Mexican immigrants \"rapists,\" Miller persuaded Sessions to become the first sitting senator to endorse him. Miller offered his services as an informal adviser to the campaign and then, after a few months, demanded a job. Trump shared Miller's instincts; in 2014, he'd cautioned Republican legislators against supporting immigration reform by implying that the beneficiaries of amnesty would vote for Democrats. Miller wrote Trump's speeches and helped turn his xenophobic promises-a border wall, a Muslim ban-into policy proposals. And when Trump took office, Miller and Sessions were rewarded: Sessions was named attorney general, and Miller became a senior policy adviser for Trump. With Miller's help, Trump stocked his agencies with alumni of the anti-immigration think tank ecosystem. Trump appointed Francis Cissna, a former employee of FAIR ally Chuck Grassley, to head US Citizenship and Immigration Services, the agency that oversees legal migration. Julie Kirchner, the executive director of FAIR from 2007 to 2015, was hired to advise the acting director of Customs and Border Protection in April 2017, before moving to USCIS a month later. During his first few months in office, Trump implemented dozens of policies-including expanding immigrant detention, reviving partnerships between Immigration and Customs Enforcement and local law enforcement agencies, and expediting certain deportation proceedings-that seemed to have been lifted from a 2016 wish list that CIS had published before Trump secured the nomination. In 2017, for the first time, CIS was invited to ICE's semiannual stakeholder meeting. Representatives from FAIR and NumbersUSA also attended.\n\nBut Trump's Department of Homeland Security was tumultuous. Staffers resigned with an alarming frequency, often after Miller pressured them to implement increasingly hard-line policies. Miller and a key ally, Gene Hamilton, senior counsel for Trump's first DHS secretary, spent months pushing for a family separation policy at the US-Mexico border. Elaine Duke, Trump's second DHS secretary, balked; Kirstjen Nielsen, her successor, eventually gave in to the pressure. It didn't fare well for her: After mass protests and calls for congressional inquiries, Trump ended the family separation policy and Nielsen handed in her resignation.\n\nMiller's position as an adviser to the president gave him wide latitude in the White House. \"The process for making decisions didn't exist when we came in,\" an immigration official in the Biden administration recently told The New Yorker . \"It was calls with Stephen Miller in which he yelled at the career officials, and they went off to do what he said, or to try.\"\n\nFor a brief moment in the wake of Biden's 2020 victory against Trump, immigrant advocacy groups felt relief. The nation had voted against separating migrant families and banning Muslims. This optimism was cut short by Republicans, who started to spout immigrants-are-invading rhetoric almost as soon as Biden took office. Two months into Biden's term, the Heritage Foundation accused him of causing a \"crisis\" at the southern border. Miller and his crew seized the narrative early, pushing the Biden administration into a defensive posture. Biden's team quickly abandoned the promises they had made during the 2020 campaign to undo the harms that had been perpetrated by Trump's DHS and to build a new, humane immigration system in its place. While Biden has rolled back some of Trump's harshest policies at the border and created pathways for migrants from certain countries to lawfully enter and work in the United States on a temporary basis, these are half-measures at best.\n\nPublic sentiment on immigration has shifted significantly since Biden took office-and now, with Kamala Harris as the nominee, the Democrats are sending a far different message than they did in 2020. One of Harris's first campaign ads touts her experience as a \"border state prosecutor\" who \"took on drug cartels and jailed gang members\" and reminds voters that as vice president, she backed the \"toughest border control bill in decades.\" Harris's warning to would-be migrants in 2021-\"Do not come\"-is now the kind of thing a growing number of Democratic voters seems eager to hear. In February, a Gallup poll found that immigration was the most important issue for voters. And in July, a poll found that 55 percent of American adults want to see immigration to the United States go down-the first time in more than 20 years that a majority of voters have said they want fewer immigrants in the country.\n\nHaving convinced the public that illegal immigration is out of control, the nativist right is now shifting its efforts toward limiting legal migration. The Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 to remake the federal government under a Trump presidency includes a chapter on the DHS that recommends reducing or outright eliminating visas issued to foreign students \"from enemy nations\"; reimplementing USCIS's denaturalization unit to strip certain naturalized citizens of their status; retraining USCIS officers to focus on \"fraud detection\"; eliminating the diversity visa lottery; ending so-called \"chain migration\"; and creating a \"merit-based system that rewards high-skilled aliens instead of the current system that favors extended family-based and luck-of-the-draw immigration.\"\n\nJohn Tanton, more than anyone else, understood the power of harnessing the public's fears and anxieties in the service of a broader political project. FAIR, CIS, and NumbersUSA's public campaigns may have focused on illegal immigration, but the organizations were founded to undo the harms that Tanton believed stemmed from the legal immigration facilitated by the Immigration Act of 1965. Project 2025, if it comes to fruition, may be what he and his disciples have long been waiting for. The indefatigable Tanton, who died in 2019 after a long battle with Parkinson's, did not live to see the very Democrats who once chanted \"Immigrants are welcome here\" embrace policies of restriction. If he had, it's hard to imagine that he would've been surprised. In the 1989 oral history, Tanton said that those who \"deal in the world of ideas\" come to expect a common trajectory: \"The first response of many people is to say, 'I never heard of it before.' And the second response after they thought about it for a bit was to say, 'It's anti-God.' And the third response after they'd realized the idea was right was to come around and say, 'I knew it all along.'\"\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids ramped up almost immediately after Trump returned to the White House, with the agency arresting nearly 1,200 people across the country in a single day. The administration reportedly plans to conduct major raids in three cities each week. It has also begun flying migrants to the prison on the Guantánamo Bay Navy base.\n\nThe Trump administration is already being sued in multiple jurisdictions and by various actors over its immigration policies. These legal challenges could prevent the most egregious abuses, like the attempted abolition of birthright citizenship, from going into effect-though the current makeup of both the federal judiciary and the Supreme Court makes it hard to be optimistic about even that. Still, no amount of pushback will stop Trump's army of nativists, led by White House adviser Stephen Miller, from trying to enact their white nationalist agenda.\n\nAnd this time around, the administration can rely on help from some members of the Democratic Party, who appear to have decided they have no choice but to collaborate with Trump's immigration policies.\n\nAfter Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem descended on New York City in a bulletproof vest, bragging about ICE \"getting the dirt bags off the streets,\" Mayor Eric Adams said he had \"directed the NYPD to coordinate\" with ICE to carry out an arrest-a reminder of the limitations of New York's \"sanctuary\" law. (The city has also advised migrant shelters that they were allowed to let ICE agents enter their premises without a warrant in certain circumstances.)\n\nAt a press conference, New York Governor Kathy Hochul said ICE was only going after \"people who committed crimes, serious offenders, and those are exactly the people we want removed from the state of New York.\" ICE boasted of the arrests of alleged members of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang, including a man wanted on kidnapping and burglary charges, but the agency has only released the name and charges of one of these so-called \"criminal aliens.\" And while Democratic politicians say their cooperation is about getting criminals off the streets, the White House has made it clear they consider anyone in the country without authorization a target.\n\nCongressional Democrats, too, appear eager to do their part to help Trump. Just two days into Trump's term, Congress passed the Laken Riley Act, a bill requiring mandatory immigration detention for all noncitizens charged with theft, drunk driving, and certain violent crimes. The bill's passage was helped along by dozens of Democrats in the House and 12 in the Senate , including Pennsylvania's John Fetterman, who attended the signing ceremony for the bill, and newly elected Arizona senator Ruben Gallego, who told Politico he was channeling the \"perspective of working class Latinos from Arizona.\" Never mind that less than a year ago, Republicans tanked the Democrats' much-touted \"bipartisan border bill\" at Trump's behest because they didn't want to give Biden a win during an election year.\n\nRather than picking up on the art of stonewalling from their colleagues across the aisle, Democrats seem to think that this time, bipartisanship will yield political victories. \"If we agree to detain 'criminal aliens,'\" the logic goes, \"perhaps they'll grant us concessions elsewhere.\" This strategy has not worked a single time in the Trump era, but nevertheless, the Democrats persist.\n\nIf the fragmented Democratic coalition had competent leadership, the Trumpian model could have been instructive.\n\nBiden did try to carve out a more humane immigration policy than his predecessor, at least at the beginning of his term. He implemented a 100-day deportation moratorium, ended Trump's disastrous \"Remain in Mexico\" policy, and urged Congress to pass a bill creating a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants. Conservatives predictably sued over the moratorium and refused to consider an \"amnesty\" bill. The Biden administration took the legal challenges, combined with the right's immediate accusations that Biden was presiding over a \"border crisis,\" as a sign to negotiate with Republicans on immigration instead of fighting them. Biden spent the remainder of his term in a defensive posture, fending off accusations of having \"opened\" the border while simultaneously alienating the immigrant rights groups that helped elect him by embracing the Title 42 expulsion order implemented by Trump at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nWhen arrivals did surge, Biden had already been backed into a corner by his own attempts to reason with his political opponents. And when Title 42 was finally lifted in 2023, Biden's DHS began requiring migrants to book appointments to seek asylum via a glitchy app called CBP One.\n\nBiden and his allies described this as a creation of \"lawful pathways\" for asylum seekers, obfuscating the fact that seeking asylum is already legal and that the app, with its limited appointments, curtailed migrants' ability to do so while keeping them trapped in border cities where they became easy prey for cartels. Trump then shut down CBP One on his first day back in office, without establishing a replacement program. This move was decried, correctly, as an attack on migrants-but it's an attack that wouldn't have been possible without Biden's endless capitulations to nativists. (Biden did create temporary pathways for migrants from certain countries, including Venezuela and Haiti, to legally live and work in the US for two years; Trump is now reportedly preparing to reverse these measures.)\n\nThe combination of Republican zealotry and Democratic collaborationism bodes badly for the future. In the coming weeks and months, we can expect to see more ICE raids, both in the form of targeted arrests and large-scale operations. Asylum seekers and refugees-including those who were approved for resettlement after a years-long process-will be denied entry. Deportations will continue, as they always have, but many of the people arrested in the coming weeks won't be deported immediately. Instead, they'll languish in detention centers, and when those inevitably fill up, DHS will no doubt turn to tracking people in deportation proceedings with ankle monitors, smartwatches, and other electronic surveillance mechanisms-the same \"alternatives to detention\" Republicans claimed were unacceptable nearly every day in the four years leading up to Trump's second inauguration. The expansion of this vast surveillance apparatus , which at its peak tracked more than 180,000 people, is among Biden's biggest gifts to Trump.\n\nIt is no longer useful to see Democrats' willingness to cooperate with Republicans on immigration as a betrayal of the anti-Trump \"resistance.\" Instead, we should see it as a return to form for a party that has always made distinctions between \"good\" and \"bad\" immigrants.\n\nIn 1996, Bill Clinton signed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act, a bill passed with overwhelming bipartisan support that expanded the list of crimes that could trigger deportation, thus making far more people-including permanent residents-deportable. The bill's supporters justified its punitive policies by saying they only applied to criminals; law-abiding immigrants would be fine. A little less than two decades later, Barack Obama was describing his approach to deportation as targeting \"felons, not families.\" These distinctions didn't help stem anti-immigrant politics then. Now, the lines Democrats have insisted on drawing between good and bad immigrants have been blurred and are at risk of being erased altogether. They have no one to blame but themselves.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts.

It's wrong no matter how you look at it.\n\nSenator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) speaks about Republicans' abandoning the bipartisan border deal during the Senate Democrats' press conference in the US Capitol on Tuesday, February 6, 2024.\n\nThis week, Senate Democrats and the White House took a sudden-and, by their own admission, rightward-turn on immigration, angering immigrant rights activists and throwing out years of liberal rhetoric and policy perspectives they had, at least in theory, claimed to support.\n\nThe 370-page border bill that Democrats signed off on reads like a GOP wish list. Perhaps that's because Republicans helped write the bill (though many of them promptly turned around and helped tank it after Donald Trump announced his opposition). Among its provisions: $8 billion in emergency funding for ICE, including $3 billion to increase detentions; a mechanism to \"shut down\" the border if a certain number of people cross; $7 billion in emergency funding for Customs and Border Protection; and a continuation of Trump's border wall. A few progressive-sounding add-ons aside, like freeing up a limited number of new visas and hiring some more lawyers, the legislation is a complete concession to the worst aspects of Trumpism that Biden and Democrats purportedly ran against in 2020.\n\nHow do Democrats justify this lurch toward increased brutality at the border? Some appear to view it as a clever maneuver to beat the GOP at their own game. By adopting Republican framing and policy on immigration, and still getting rebuffed, this thinking goes, Democrats will show voters that Trump-driven hysteria is to blame for the supposed \"crisis\" at the border. It's a confounding and amoral \"gotcha\" strategy, in which people seeking to move across the border in pursuit of safety, work, and a new home amount to little more than a mechanism for media narrative point-scoring.\n\nThe messaging gambit from the White House and leading Senate Democrats is equal parts vulgar, xenophobic, and too cute by half. They are, they readily proclaim, giving Republicans \" what they asked for .\" And then, when Republicans reject it, Democrats say those Republicans want \"border chaos\" and are simply pawns of Trump and Trumpism. Republicans \"appointed the Republican negotiator,\" Senator Chris Murphy, one of the architects of the border bill, tweeted on Tuesday . He then told reporters , \"We followed [Republicans'] instructions to the letter.\" Republicans \"got what they wanted,\" Senator Tina Smith (D-Minn.) said on social media . Senator Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) would add , with feigned credulity, \"Just gobsmacked. I've never seen anything like it. [Senate Republicans] literally demanded specific policy, got it, and then killed it.\"\n\nThis line may have sounded clever in whatever West Wing whiteboarding session it emanated from, but the whole gambit rests on a confusing moral narrative: Do Democrats now agree with the Republican party on immigration, ideologically? Their outward messaging appears to accept the premise that this hard-right bill will \" fix the border \" (whatever this means), so it seems they do. Top Democratic senators are proudly boosting an endorsement of the bill by the Border Patrol union, a far-right union with a history of promoting white nationalism and avidly backing Trump. MSNBC personality Al Sharpton, much to the right-wing media's gratification, said in an interview with Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) Tuesday that \"we're looking every day at the invasion of migrants\"-positively Trumpian rhetoric. This seems like quite a pivot after Democratic party messaging ran in 2020 on criticizing Trump's border policies and rhetoric as akin to Nazism . If so, do the Democrats now owe the GOP an apology?\n\nOr, do Democrats not really think these far-right policies are good, but are simply \"calling Republicans' bluff\" to prove some broader meta-point? And if so, isn't it quite a gamble to risk the immigration status of millions and stoke nativist fears to get some cutesy hypocrisy gotcha over on the Republicans? If Democrats can, seemingly overnight, radically alter their position on immigration from one that at least pretended to pay lip service to the humanity of those seeking a better life in the US to nonstop tough-guy posturing about \"harsh,\" \"strict,\" \"tough\" \"border security,\" then what message does this send to other vulnerable groups?\n\nThe bill seeks to more than double ICE's \"enforcement\" budget for what is already \"the deadliest land route for migrants worldwide, according to the UN's International Organization for Migration. That body found that 686 migrants died or disappeared on the US-Mexico border in 2022 alone. That is part of a chilling pattern stretching over decades. According to the Arizona-based humanitarian group No More Deaths , US border authorities routinely use the borderlands as a weapon, chasing border crossers through dangerous terrain and using scatter tactics to strand them in the perilous desert, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths and disappearances since the 1990s.\n\nThe logic of deterrence has animated the bipartisan approach to immigration since Operation Gatekeeper was embraced by President Clinton in 1994. As Pedro Rios of the American Friends Service Committee's US-Mexico Border Program wrote for The Washington Post in 2019, Operation Gatekeeper promised \"prevention through deterrence.\" As Rois explained, \"The Border Patrol's public rationale was that making it harder to cross the border would mean fewer people would try to come to the United States.\"\n\nThis logic still animates US policy and has been tripled down on by the Democrats' latest framework. The solution to \"fix\" \"the border\" is to create even more violence. What will disincentive desperate, poor immigrants from seeking a better life in the United States? Presumably, 686 deaths isn't sufficient. So maybe 3,000? 6,000? The logic of managing borders by ratcheting up human suffering as a deterrent is a nihilistic approach. But it is the only one we are permitted to have because asking deeper questions about what causes the conditions the migrants are fleeing is seen as pie-in-the-sky academic questions unfit for Serious Politicians.\n\nA dedication to co-opting supposedly popular right-wing ideas as their own in order to take the wind out of the sails of the Republicans is a defining feature of centrist Democrats, a group from which Biden proudly hails. Whether this strategy is effective at actually winning elections is unclear, and in many ways immaterial. After 30 years of this approach-a period that has encompassed as many spectacular losses as triumphant victories for Democrats- one could reasonably surmise that its proponents aren't primarily driven by winning elections, but rather that they genuinely have right-wing ideological commitments and use electoralism as a moral and narrative cover.\n\nIndeed, the person who coined the term for this practice, \"triangulation politics,\" was former Bill Clinton aide Dick Morris. He went on to become a full-blown Republican, backed the candidacies of Mitt Romney and Donald Trump, and these days is a frequent contributor to Fox News. Looking back three decades later, one is left to ask: Was this really about positioning Clinton to win his 1996 reelection, or was it simply because Morris and others in the conservative Third Way coalition simply agreed with much of the Republican platform?\n\nThe difference between doing right-wing things to win elections and doing right-wing things because Democrats simply agree with them cannot, and will not, be resolved in this piece. Ultimately, what matters is not what is in Democrats' hearts but the material consequences of their actions. Their current embrace of what they casually refer to as the Republican plan, even if it does not pass, does tremendous damage to the cause of a more humane and liberal immigration policy and sets the stage for an even greater punitive, cruel, and violent crackdown in the years to come. Moreover, the decision to wildly contradict the party's previous position on immigration and take a hard-right turn signals to every constituent member of the tenuous Democratic coalition that they-at any point it is deemed convenient-are entirely expendable. A myopic ethos in a party that's constantly flabbergasted as to why it has such unenthusiastic support and low voter turnout.\n\nComing at the same time that the Biden team has all but written off Arab, Muslim-and, increasingly, Black -support over its lockstep support of Israel's \" plausible genocide \" in Gaza, the broader message that vulnerable populations will be summarily thrown under the bus if it's perceived to have any micro-advantage come November, is received by those on the margins of society loud and clear. (And since picking off votes among Panera Bread whites is the holiest of holies for centrist Democrats, the idea that this amoral, scattered approach could depress support among people of color, young voters, or immigrants and their loved ones is simply not factored in.)\n\nThis isn't to say the political blowback from undocumented migrants arriving in cash-strapped cities isn't real. Strained by manufactured austerity and zero-sum bottom-rung politics, local officials are drawn to the easy answers of more cops and cages-not just to displacement, but crime, homelessness, and a host of social problems. Cut off from resources and only provided federal support via carceral solutions, everything looks like a law enforcement problem. Tens of billions of dollars magically appear out of thin air for weapons shipments to Israel and helicopters and drones for the US-Mexico border, but can't seem to find their way into the city coffers of Chicago, San Antonio, Seattle, and New York for social services.\n\nSenate Democrats have entirely foreclosed on anything remotely resembling a politics of evidence-based solutions, much less baseline humanity. All that's left is fear, grimy co-option of right-wing rhetoric and policy, and maybe a token liberal-sounding drop in the ocean of reaction to give progressive loyalists something, anything, to point to. But 95 percent of the bill is bars, batons, and bullets. And voters are, once again, given the distinct impression that nothing matters, nothing is sacred, and every vulnerable group-if the polling winds blow a certain way-is expendable.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Activate your online access\n\nThe double movement of Central and North American migration.\n\nIn Everyone Who Is Gone Is Here , Jonathan Blitzer examines how North and Central American migration moves in two directions.\n\nDr. Juan Romagoza at La Clinica del Pueblo in 1998.\n\nEddie Anzora arrived in El Salvador, the country of his birth, on the eve of its independence day. He had spent virtually his entire life in California, and his return was not a homecoming but an exile. A minor conviction for drug possession in 1997 had put Eddie on track for deportation, even though he had a green card. After a decade of dodging immigration officers, he was arrested on his way to the barbershop. He spent nine months in a Los Angeles County jail mentally preparing himself for a return to a country he hardly knew, until one day he and 30 other Salvadorans-all shackled at the wrists and ankles-were loaded onto a plane bound for San Salvador.\n\nThe circumstances of Eddie's deportation were the product of arcane laws drafted thousands of miles away by politicians who, if they thought of people like Eddie at all, regarded them as collateral damage at best and subhuman at worst. The year before his arrest, Congress had passed-and Bill Clinton had eagerly signed into law-legislation that gave immigration officers a mandate to deport noncitizens convicted of certain crimes. It didn't matter that Eddie wasn't in a gang (in fact, he had joined a \"gang-skeptic\" group called Above the Rest), that the cops had decided to stop him without a legal pretext, or that he had been found with a negligible amount of weed on him. The arrest branded him a \"criminal alien\" and thus a priority for deportation.\n\n\"Politics,\" Jonathan Blitzer writes in Everyone Who Is Gone Is Here , his new book on the origins of today's border crisis, \"is a form of selective amnesia,\" but \"the people who survive it are our insurance against forgetting.\" Eddie is one of those survivors and one form of this insurance. Like the other migrants highlighted in Blitzer's book, he finds himself caught up in the cruel and crushing bureaucracy that is the US immigration system. He also proves far luckier than others ensnared in this web: Within a month of arriving in El Salvador, Eddie gets hired at a call center, where he works alongside other deportees. A perpetual hustler, he eventually opens a language school to train a new generation of call-center staffers. His pitch to prospective students: Learn English from a native speaker. But as Blitzer is careful to point out, most of the others that Eddie returned with fared far worse: \"Of the thirty people on his original deportation flight, fewer than five were still alive.\"\n\nBlitzer's book is a study of migration moving in two directions. While thousands of Salvadorans living in the United States are, like Eddie, forced onto deportation flights, thousands of others in El Salvador find themselves pushed out of their homes and forced to leave the country as a result of increasing gang violence and the fallout of decades of US-backed Cold War counterinsurgency programs. Between 2007 and 2015, the number of people who emigrated to the United States from Central America's so-called Northern Triangle (El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras) rose by 25 percent. Blitzer painstakingly recounts the brutal circumstances behind this mass exodus, emphasizing the humanity of the people who uprooted their lives in search of safety in the US, only to find themselves criminalized in the very country they hoped would be their refuge.\n\nEach person's calculus for leaving is different. Some, Blitzer notes, are escaping torture, others poverty; in almost all cases, they have no legal channel through which to migrate. Keldy, a Honduran mother of three, goes to Denver with her husband in 2007 in search of work. \"Although they never planned to stay in the U.S. for long,\" Blitzer writes, \"they risked everything to get there.\" The trip is not easy. In Mexico, aboard the perilous freight train that migrants call \"the Beast,\" Keldy's husband ties her to one of the cars so she doesn't fall off. Later they're kidnapped by Los Zetas, one of Mexico's most notorious criminal syndicates. In Denver, their perilous journey gives way to the monotony of wage work: Keldy prepares and sells food, her husband paints houses, and they save up enough money to build a home in Honduras, where they return in 2010. \"Neither of them expected to visit the U.S. ever again,\" Blitzer writes.\n\nBut Keldy and her husband's homecoming is marred by tragedy. Keldy's family is threatened by armed men in Honduras who know she went north for work and assume that she came back wealthy. Several of her brothers are killed as a result. After two years of endless harassment and violence, Keldy and her husband flee with their sons, first to a small town in the forest and then-after Keldy testifies in court against one of the killers-to northern Mexico, where, armed with \"a sheaf of documents held together with rubber bands,\" Keldy and her two youngest boys cross the border into the US to ask for asylum.\n\nWhat happens next will sound familiar to anyone who was paying attention to immigration policy at the height of the Trump era: Keldy is taken into custody and prosecuted for crossing the border illegally, and her sons are sent to a shelter for unaccompanied migrant kids. The boys, ages 13 and 15, are among the more than 5,600 children separated from their parents at the border under the Trump administration's zero-tolerance policy. In an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center, Keldy meets other despondent women who faced a similar fate, and she compiles their names on a list that she hands to an immigrant-rights activist in the hope that she might help them. Meanwhile, an indifferent judge denies Keldy's asylum claim, and while awaiting an appeal, she is tricked into signing a deportation order. Her sons are not sent back with her; they remain in the United States, living with an aunt in Philadelphia.\n\nTrump's border policies appear late in the book. But that is because the policies that preceded his-including those implemented under Barack Obama during his two terms as president-were also predicated on a logic of rounding up unauthorized immigrants in the interior of the country and preventing those at the border from getting any farther. Though Blitzer doesn't make this argument explicit, he clearly wants to remind readers that the Trump administration's cruelty was not an aberration or a break from precedent. Rather, it was the culmination of nearly half a century of bipartisan hostility toward migrants and the United States' ruinous foreign-policy decisions in Central and South America. As Blitzer illustrates, the forces driving migrants from their homes are stronger than those giving them a good reason to stay.\n\nBlitzer has a magazine writer's keen attention to detail, and while the larger policy decisions of the United States are never far from the book's narrative, he also turns his readers' attention to the people whose lives are affected by them. His aim, he tells us, is \"to be a kind of go-between: to tell each side's story to the other\" and to allow migrants \"to participate, for once, in the privileged backroom conversations that decide their fate.\"\n\nShifting his book's narrative back in time to the 1960s, Blitzer takes us to the small Salvadoran city of Usulután and introduces us to Juan Romagoza, a 13-year-old who dreams of becoming a heart doctor. The El Salvador of Juan's youth is no less dangerous than the country that Eddie Anzora returned to in 2007. The anti-communist military campaigns that occurred during Juan's childhood and adolescence later gave way to gang violence, often committed with the weapons the US had sent to El Salvador during the Cold War. In the early years of Juan's life, El Salvador was still contending with the fallout from the mass killings of suspected communists by government forces, which was referred to as La Matanza-\"The Massacre.\" By the time he was a teenager, El Salvador's military had become brutally adept at eliminating communists and suspected communists. In 1980, a few weeks into his surgery residency, Juan operated on a student protester who had been shot by police. Hours later, security forces stormed the hospital to finish the job. Juan, who had been keeping vigil at the patient's bedside, witnessed the murder. Less than a year later, while Juan conducted medical exams on campesinos in a rural hamlet, soldiers accused him of being a guerrilla and took him into custody, torturing him for weeks. Juan was eventually released, but thousands of others weren't so lucky. More than 5,000 people were disappeared in the 12 years of El Salvador's US-backed civil war, an estimated 75,000 others were killed, and nearly 1 million people fled the country. Among them was Juan, who was smuggled out of El Salvador in the back of a truck with two other men, hidden under bags of onions.\n\nJuan settled in Mexico City, where he affected a Chiapas accent that he deployed in conversation like a shield. No longer able to pursue his dream of becoming a surgeon-one of his captors had mutilated Juan's hands-he found work at a restaurant. On weekends, he headed north, to a clinic along the US-Mexican border, where he tended to US-bound Guatemalan refugees who had escaped their own country's civil war. Though Juan would drive them to the fence dividing the United States and Mexico and deliver them to Arizona-based activists who helped them sneak across the border, he had no interest in crossing himself. It wasn't fear that kept him from attempting it, but hope. Even though the border was far less policed at the time, Juan thought of his banishment to Mexico as temporary, and the farther he strayed from El Salvador, the more it felt like he was giving up on his prospects of ever returning.\n\nJuan eventually entered the United States in 1983. With a physician's sensibility, he reasoned that if he wanted to effect meaningful change, he should treat the disease rather than the symptoms. \"If he traveled north,\" Blitzer writes of Juan's decision, \"maybe there was some chance of doing something, however slight, that could pressure Washington to help wind down the conflict\" in El Salvador. After all, the US government was funding the Salvadoran military's human-rights abuses. Arriving in California, Juan became a community doctor of sorts and connected San Francisco's growing undocumented population with free health services. He also held impromptu talk-therapy sessions for Salvadoran war refugees in Dolores Park. Unlike many of his compatriots, whose asylum claims were denied en masse-just 3 percent of Salvadoran asylum petitions were approved between 1980 and 1990-Juan was granted asylum in 1987. Green card in hand, he then moved to Washington, D.C.-\"the capital of the empire that drove me from my home\"-to run a community health clinic.\n\nJuan's trajectory is a best-case scenario, a rare example of the asylum system functioning as intended. His passage from El Salvador to the United States is an instance of a migrant finding not only refuge but prosperity in the US. Yet even Juan's story is not a linear one. The past haunted him constantly. One day, at the clinic he ran in Washington, he was approached by a stranger who seemed to know a lot about him. \"You were a prisoner. You were beaten and tortured,\" the man told Juan. \"I want to tell you that I was there. I saw what they were doing to you. I was part of it.\" The man, it turned out, had been in the Salvadoran National Guard. He was conscripted, he explained, and had no choice. He was a torturer who was tortured by what he had done and who, like Juan, had escaped at the first possible opportunity. He wanted to tell Juan about all this-to unburden himself of the guilt, to explain the source of the demons that he, too, still reckoned with.\n\nThe encounter between torturer and victim may seem improbable, almost like something taken from a novel. But it was not an unusual experience in the tight-knit Central American enclaves that have developed across the United States. \"At least a thousand war criminals from all over the world were living in the U.S. at the time, including many Salvadoran military officers,\" Blitzer writes. \"One war refugee bumped into his torturer on a public bus in the Bay Area. The man who had killed Oscar Romero\"-the Catholic bishop who was gunned down in the middle of a mass for the high crime of opposing El Salvador's repression of anyone who dared to help the poor-\"sold used cars in Modesto, California.\" Teenagers who had fled gang violence in San Salvador can find themselves sitting next to MS-13 members in classrooms on Long Island. Persecuted and persecutor alike wind up in the United States.\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJeet Heer\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nIn 2002, Juan had the opportunity to confront some of the more guilty parties in his own persecution: He testified against two Salvadoran generals, José Guillermo García and Carlos Eugenio Vides Casanova, the latter of whom had overseen his torture, as part of a landmark human-rights case. Vides Casanova maintained his steely demeanor as Juan recounted how he was beaten, mutilated, and starved by members of the National Guard. Juan, meanwhile, \"had the sensation of leaving his body and floating above himself,\" Blitzer writes. \"He wasn't alone. He was merging with the bodies of the people he knew, those who had died. The mother of his child. Romero. His friends. Family members.... Everyone who is gone is here.\"\n\nThis powerful phrase, which Blitzer takes as the title of his book, is also the central message of Everyone Who Is Gone Is Here : What we often think of as a unidirectional cross-border movement of people from Central to North America actually flows both ways, as do the consequences of the human-rights crises that the United States has helped create. While Juan and many other Central Americans may see the ghosts of US power at home and encounter the demons they spent a lifetime running from even in the United States, these phantoms should haunt all Americans, too. Our lives are inextricably linked to those of people thousands of miles away, some of whom used to be our neighbors. As someone like Eddie Anzora knows all too well, sometimes the only way you can return home is as a disembodied voice, an interlocutor on the other end of a phone call.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Generally, these processing cells accommodate just a few immigrants for up to 12 hours. But in the last few months, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which has an office in the building, has been packing them full of people for days at a stretch, lawyers in the area say, seemingly violating the agency's own rules. While immigrants are held there, they have no access to beds, showers, hygiene products, or lifesaving medication.\n\nTypically, agents in the Baltimore field office use these cells to confine people they have arrested before transferring them to longer-term detention centers-or to hold them briefly when they come back for their immigration hearings on the fourth floor of the same building. According to ICE's detention standards , such holding cells tend to have doors fitted with glass or barred windows for \"convenient security checks.\" They come with toilets, but movable furniture and cots are not allowed in them. ICE's policy stipulates that, \"absent exceptional circumstances,\" no one should be held in these cells for longer than 12 hours .\n\nBetween November and March, detentions have lasted for much longer, often from 48 hours to nine days, lawyers said. They believe more than 50 people were held at the Baltimore courthouse over the March 8 weekend. Several lawyers said their clients shared the small rooms in the office building with 10 to 20 people. Some learned about these conditions only after their clients were transferred to a different facility.\n\nThe courthouse detentions appear to be the symptom of a confluence of recent federal policies meant to speed up deportations since the start of Donald Trump's second term. Michael Lukens, executive director of the Amica Center, an organization that provides legal services for immigrants, explained that long-term detention in what are \"essentially cages\" in the field office is a recent development and not typical. His organization suspects this is happening elsewhere in the country and is preparing to file a lawsuit. In general, lawyers often argue in cases about inhumane detention conditions that the agency is violating its own rules-or general national standards-and in certain contexts can sue for damages.\n\nRegular detention centers may be nearing capacity, Lukens said, \"so ICE is now breaking their own rules, holding people in inhumane conditions because of this mass detention campaign.\"\n\nAccording to an e-mail from an American Immigration Lawyers Association liaison, Baltimore ICE Director Matthew Elliston has told local attorneys the field office received a waiver for the 12-hour rule when detention centers in Virginia and Pennsylvania are full.\n\nSome Baltimore courthouse detainees were arrested by ICE during field operations or arrested after they were ordered deported by a judge in the immigration court within the building, without being given a chance to file an appeal with the board that reviews immigration court decisions, Lukens said. This pattern of arresting people at the courthouse before their appeal process can begin is also unprecedented, he said.\n\nAlong with other news of aggressive arrests and deportations , the Baltimore detentions add credence to the theory that ICE agents \"seem to be out there arresting anybody they can arrest, and then figuring it out later-and the reason for that seems specifically targeted toward driving arrest numbers up, because they're being told they have to meet quotas,\" said Sirine Shebaya, executive director of the National Immigration Project, which is partnering on the forthcoming litigation with the Amica Center.\n\nICE said its holding cells were not subject to national detention guidelines but did not respond to questions about whether it is violating the standards specific to holding cells. A spokesperson wrote via e-mail that the agency \"remains committed to enforcing immigration laws fairly, safely, and humanely, and ensures that holding facilities operate in full compliance with federal laws, agency policies, and established standards to uphold the well-being and dignity of those in our custody.\"\n\nImmigration attorney Katie Hyde's client, a Central American grandmother, was held in the processing cells in the building for five days at the end of February. It was only after she was transferred out to another facility that she confided to Hyde about her experience. The woman has grandchildren who are US citizens, has lived in the United States for over 20 years, and did not have a criminal record. According to Hyde, she was picked up in the Maryland area because she was present when ICE agents arrested an undocumented family member. This client told Hyde that she was not allowed to shower for the entirety of her courthouse detention-and not given access to toothbrush, toothpaste, or hair ties. She had to use the public toilet in the cell in front of other detainees. She and other detainees slept on the floor with no mattress and were sometimes refused foil blankets when they asked for them. For days, her family had no idea where she was held. \"Hearing her experience was truly appalling,\" said Hyde, a staff attorney with Amica's Detained Adult Program. \"I have not seen treatment like this for my clients before-it's emblematic of the cruelty of this administration's immigration policy.\"\n\nAnother Amica attorney, Sabrina Surgil, said her client was a Black Belizean man in his 50s who suffered tremendous medical neglect while held in the field office. The man has lived in the country since he was 6 years old and has family members who are US citizens. He was in removal proceedings while serving a state prison sentence when Surgil took on his case last year. ICE transferred him to the Baltimore courthouse upon his release without notifying Surgil. For two days there, her client-who is diabetic and requires constant glucose monitoring and treatment-was not given his insulin or other medication and became delirious, Surgil said. Upon his transfer to a facility in Florida, he was placed under medical observation for 23 hours due to \"uncontrolled diabetes,\" according to medical records reviewed by Type and The Nation .\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJeet Heer\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nA third Maryland-area attorney not affiliated with Amica said that two of his clients from Mexico were held at the courthouse. The attorney, who wanted his name withheld for fear of retaliation from the government, said one client was an undocumented construction worker in his 30s who was held there February 5 to 11 before being transferred out. According to notes from a conversation with his attorney on March 12, this man described being kept in a 12-by-18-foot cell with 20 men, having to use the in-room toilet in front of the other detainees, and spending the entire time in the same clothes without being able to shower. He told his attorney he got one phone call, but had to pay if he wanted to make any additional calls.\n\nOther reports Amica has received included the case of a detainee with HIV who wasn't given access to medication and a transgender woman who spent eight days alone in a Baltimore holding room before being transferred to an all-male detention facility.\n\nThe administration has recently begun pushing to expand immigrant detention capacity as it ramps up arrests. On Tuesday, Tom Homan, Trump administration's so-called border czar, told Fox News that ICE is currently detaining 46,000 people and was on track to run out of beds in two weeks-a bid to get Congress to disperse more funding to the agency. Axios reports that the agency is now telling Congress it needs an additional $2 billion for the rest of this fiscal year, much of it for extra bed space \"to detain people for a couple of days while they're processing,\" Senator James Lankford, a Republican from Oklahoma, told Axios .\n\nAmica attorneys believe that the Baltimore detentions may be part of the effort to push for more ICE facilities in the face of local opposition. Maryland's Democratic-controlled legislature passed the Dignity Not Detention Act in 2021, which required ICE to close down all four of its detention centers in the state. And after the Trump administration rolled back constraints on ICE activity in \"protected areas\" like courthouses, schools, churches, and hospitals, an emergency bill seeking to impose such limits at the local level is currently under deliberation in the state legislature.\n\n\"Now, ICE isn't going to get the Maryland legislature to change, but I think they will use this in rhetoric to say, 'Well, we have to hold people here because Maryland will comply with federal law or won't help ICE,'\" Lukens said. \"That's nonsense. This is really about overcrowding because of over-enforcement.\"\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

      "text": "Economists Love Immigration. Why Do So Many Americans Hate It?\n\nOn October 5, 1908, a hammy melodrama made its début in Washington, D.C.: Israel Zangwill's \"The Melting-Pot,\" a four-act play that introduced the dominant metaphor for the American immigrant experience. The plot is thin-a New York tenement romance threatened by an Old World blood feud is mended by the salvific power of patriotism. Mostly, it's a pretext for pontificating about a new American religion. \"America is God's Crucible, the great Melting-Pot where all the races of Europe are melting and re-forming!\" the protagonist, a struggling Jewish composer named David Quixano, proclaims. \"What is the glory of Rome and Jerusalem where all nations and races come to worship and look back, compared with the glory of America, where all races and nations come to labour and look forward!\"\n\nThe critics were mainly contemptuous. \"Sentimental trash masquerading as a human document,\" the New York Times judged. Across the Atlantic, the Times of London declared the play's \"rhapsodising over music and crucibles and statues of liberty\" to be \"romantic claptrap.\" But when President Theodore Roosevelt attended the première he was utterly smitten. (\"That's a great play, Mr. Zangwill, that's a great play!\" he is said to have shouted.) The vivid allegory-of \"souls melting in the Crucible\" and divine fires purging inherited rivalries-imprinted something indelible on the American psyche.\n\nThe play arrived during a heyday of immigration. Ellis Island was at peak capacity, accepting nineteen hundred newcomers a day; one in seven Americans was foreign-born. Although plenty of native-born Americans were troubled, Zangwill's openhearted sentiments spoke to many others. Yet only a few years later the play's hopefulness seemed dated and out of step. The First World War heightened suspicion of foreigners, who competed for jobs (maybe harboring unionist sympathies?) and dressed and spoke oddly (maybe never planning to assimilate?). In 1924, the Times published a screed complaining that \"the melting pot, besides having its own color, begins to give out its own smell. Its reek fills New York and floats out rather widely in all directions.\" The same year, Congress passed the Johnson-Reed Act, which set extremely low quotas on total immigration and barred people from Asia. For the next four decades, the great, godly smelting machines would largely sit idle.\n\nDiscover notable new fiction, nonfiction, and poetry.\n\nAlongside that history of xenophobia, of course, is a civic creed that we teach schoolchildren and roll out for public ceremonies-the one that declares America to be a \"nation of immigrants,\" even if the melting-pot metaphor has been replaced with kaleidoscopes, mosaics, and salad bowls (plus a rueful acknowledgment of those whose arrival was a matter of abduction and slavery). We might exult in the economic advantages we owe to immigration, through both ordinary population growth and extraordinary entrepreneurship-then Andrew Carnegie, titan of steel, now Sundar Pichai, titan of search. The fact remains that mass migration and nativist backlash have stalked one another for more than a century. However enthusiastic the American dogma may be about immigrants past, rising migration levels invariably trigger the fear that immigrants present and future may be something different-a drag on the welfare state, a threat to native laborers, a pox on the culture.\n\nThe politics of immigration have always made for strange bedfellows. Free-trading Ayn Rand acolytes join with cosmopolitan social-justice progressives in encouraging more migration. Cultural conservatives join with old-guard trade unionists in opposition. Sorting through the thicket of questions-economic, political, and philosophical-posed by immigration has always been difficult. But those questions have gained urgency as the cycle now repeats itself. The percentage of foreign-born Americans is currently at a level last seen a century ago, and it continues to rise. Today, the Know-Nothing Party of the mid-nineteenth century has been reborn in the contemporary G.O.P.; the America First movement, once championed by the aviator Charles Lindbergh, has a new avatar in Donald Trump. Joe Biden's policies to stanch unauthorized migration across the southern border, meanwhile, suggest Trumpism with a human face . And, in New York City, behind Lady Liberty's back, Mayor Eric Adams is busing unwanted migrants to Canada .\n\nLink copied\n\nOur present-day paroxysms can be traced to the reopening of America's borders in the mid-twentieth century. This time, the arrivals were mainly non-Europeans. The Hart-Cellar Act of 1965 allowed migration from Asia once more; guest-worker programs greatly increased the United States' Hispanic population; a diversity-lottery program that was started in 1990 helped enable sizable emigration from Africa. At the same time, demand for immigration far outstripped the number of available visas. Familial preferences in immigration applications meant that an individual entrant could effectively relocate an entire clan. This feature, sometimes derided as \"chain migration,\" is rather dear to me. My uncle, an adventurous doctor from a small Punjabi village near Sialkot, Pakistan, moved to West Virginia in 1971. As a result, all eleven of his siblings-including, in Gabriel García Márquez style, six brothers who all had the first name Muhammad-were able to wend their way to America. My mother, the tenth of the litter, ended up in Lexington, Kentucky, where I was born in 1994. With a few substitutions of place and date, many Americans can tell some variant of this tale.\n\nWhat has all this global movement actually done to America? The political arguments are harder to answer than the economic ones. Although the dismal science is rife with disagreement on many topics-from microeconomists butting heads about the irrationality of human preferences to macroeconomists arguing about how to quell inflation-there is a broad consensus that immigration is largely beneficial to migrants and their hosts alike. In 2017, the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine released a mammoth report titled \" The Economic and Fiscal Consequences of Immigration .\" It found that, although immigrants tend to earn less than native-born workers and are therefore a bit more costly to governments, their children exhibit unusually high levels of upward mobility and \"are among the strongest economic and fiscal contributors in the population.\" For a country with an aging labor force, like the U.S., immigration can act like Botox for the welfare state, temporarily making the math of paying for promised benefits, like Social Security and Medicare, less daunting. (Eventually, age comes for the immigrants, too.)\n\nA breezy but powerful case for the consensus view is made in \" Streets of Gold: America's Untold Story of Immigrant Success \" (Public Affairs), by Ran Abramitzky and Leah Boustan, professors of economics at Stanford and Princeton, respectively. Many of their arguments come from their analysis of a fascinating big-data set-genealogical records collected by Ancestry.com. (When the researchers started gathering the site's data with an Internet scraper, its lawyers sent a cease-and-desist letter.) Seeing the long-run benefit of immigration requires measurement \"at the pace of generations, rather than years,\" Abramitzky and Boustan contend. In combination with detailed census records, the ancestral data debunk the idea that earlier waves of European migrants were more industrious and more culturally smeltable than contemporary migrants from elsewhere. \"Newcomers today are just as quick to move up the economic ladder as in the past, and immigrants now are integrating into American culture just as surely as immigrants back then,\" the economists write. Unlike other big Anglo countries, such as Australia, Britain, and Canada, America lacks a points-based system that explicitly advantages the already educated and already wealthy, but Abramitzky and Boustan disagree with conservative critics who argue that we should adopt one. Their analysis of a century of immigration data finds \"very few countries from which the fact of upward mobility does not hold.\" Even if migrants arrive poor, \"one generation later their children more than pay for their parents' debts.\"\n\nEmpirical economic research has tended to affirm conclusions suggested by the discipline's first principles: the argument for the free trade of goods, dating back to Adam Smith , implies an argument for the free movement of labor. Michael Clemens, a prominent economist of immigration, maintains that present-day migration barriers are so self-defeating that they are analogous to governments leaving trillion-dollar bills on the sidewalk. The gains from looser migration, in his analysis, would be several times larger than the gains from eliminating all remaining trade barriers.\n\nThe essential question is not what size the potential windfall would be but cui bono -who benefits? The primary beneficiaries are the migrants themselves, who in rich countries can earn a multiple of their old wages. Their homelands can also benefit from transfers of money; remittances make up more than one-fifth of the national incomes of countries such as El Salvador, Haiti, and Honduras. But what about their host nations, who may be effectively subsidizing this global redistribution? Ecologists distinguish between interspecies relationships that are parasitic (as between tapeworms and humans) and those which are mutualistic (like the bromance between clown fish and anemones you may remember from \"Finding Nemo,\" in which both parties benefit). In the domestic politics of immigration, restrictionists are convinced that immigrants are parasites; economists might try harder to correct that picture.\n\nConsider winemaking, which, for pioneering economists like Adam Smith, was a favorite way of illustrating the benefits of trade. In America today, the wine industry provides employment to nearly two million people; it also provides revenue to the government by the billions (and semblances of personalities to people by the millions). At the same time, domestic winemaking is made possible by temporary guest workers, typically from Mexico, who harvest grapes-including at the winery owned by Donald Trump. Are foreign agricultural laborers hurting job prospects for hardworking Americans? Cesar Chavez, the famed organizer of the United Farm Workers, was inclined to think so; in the nineteen-seventies, he launched his so-called Illegals Campaign, encouraging union members to report undocumented workers to the authorities and to run unauthorized border patrols. In the nineteen-sixties, as it happened, the U.S. once eliminated a program for guest workers called braceros (Spanish for \"those who work with their arms\") at the behest of American politicians worried about domestic wages, including John F. Kennedy. Yet Clemens and his fellow-researchers found that wages for native agricultural workers didn't appear to rise in states where the suspended braceros had been most important; the farms there seemed, instead, to have accelerated their use of labor-saving machinery. Repeat the experiment today, many vignerons warn, and the whole industry would go kaput.\n\nThe most significant academic dissenter from this pro-immigration consensus is George Borjas, an economist at Harvard's Kennedy School. Borjas spies examples everywhere of immigrant workers bringing down native ones, from the ivory tower to the factory floor. (One of his best-known papers suggests that native-born mathematicians in the U.S. became less productive-as measured by their pace of generating high-impact theorems and papers-after the Soviet Union collapsed and talented Russian mathematicians flooded their departments.) Borjas has long been locked in an econometric duel with David Card, a Nobel Prize-winning economist at the University of California, Berkeley, over the consequences of an episode known as the Mariel boatlift. In 1980, Fidel Castro announced that all Cubans wishing to immigrate to America would be free to do so from the port of Mariel-as long as they could arrange their own transportation. In the course of six months, an extraordinary number of Marielitos, some hundred and twenty-five thousand refugees, arrived in Florida. The incident provided economists with a tantalizing chance to study what an acute surge of foreign workers could do to labor markets.\n\nIn 1990, Card wrote a paper concluding that \"the Mariel influx appears to have had virtually no effect on the wages or unemployment rates of less-skilled workers, even among Cubans who had immigrated earlier\"-despite the fact that the influx had expanded the number of available workers in the local labor market by seven per cent. This was a sensational result. In 2015, though, Borjas circulated his reappraisal of Card's findings. He argued that the right way to measure the job displacement was to look squarely at non-Hispanic, male high-school dropouts in the Miami area, who would have competed most directly with the Marielitos. Their wages, he calculated, dropped dramatically, by between ten and thirty per cent. Supporters of Card retorted that Borjas had restricted his sample so severely that he was confusing statistical noise for meaningful signal. On it went. Today, Borjas remains a maverick within the profession.\n\nYet even Borjas, who was born in Havana and arrived in the United States at the age of twelve, does not claim that the net effect of immigration is negative. Rather, his view is that immigration can redistribute gains \"from those who compete with immigrants to those who use immigrants\" in ways that can be socially disruptive. You could agree with him about the distributional concerns while also thinking that a fair government could insure that everyone was truly better off-that the winners effectively compensated the losers. But what's theoretically possible has to be tested against what's politically possible. Economists can be too impatient with such realities.\n\nRecall the discipline's Pollyannaish embrace, in the nineteen-nineties, of less fettered trade with countries like China: such trade boosted the over-all economy, but eroded the livelihoods of millions of Americans who were exposed to import competition. The trade-adjustment assistance that was meant to compensate those workers was, in truth, a pittance, and left many Americans behind, and resentful. Not even a quarter century after Bill Clinton successfully championed a trade deal with China and that country's inclusion in the World Trade Organization, a bipartisan consensus against liberalizing trade has emerged. America's \"pivot to Asia\" has been hamstrung by this reality. The sweeping Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, which American officials hoped would counter Chinese influence in the East, went on after the U.S. withdrew from it-and China has now applied to be a member. Congressional politics means that the current deal the U.S. is hawking to its allies-the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework-cannot offer the benefit those allies most prize: access to American markets. A similar logic applies to both the movement of goods and the movement of people. Open the doors too hastily and they may slam shut and stay that way for a rather long time.\n\nIf the limits of immigration are bounded by political psychology rather than by economic necessity, a series of uncomfortable questions arise. What moral weight, for instance, should be accorded to the human desire for cultural continuity? Taken to an extreme, it could legitimatize the sort of ethnic separation that white nationalists aspire to when they recite their credo known as the Fourteen Words: \"We must secure the existence of our people and a future for white children.\" A few months ago, on a drive through Silicon Valley, Ro Khanna, the congressman who represents the only majority-Asian district in the continental United States, put the balance to me this way: \"People don't mind that folks are playing cricket in Fremont. They just want to make sure we have baseball, not cricket, as a national pastime.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nOn the other hand, there's the question of whether rich countries have Good Samaritan responsibilities to help poorer ones, perhaps especially former colonies. Is there an obligation to bequeath the perquisites of citizenship upon not just asylum seekers and refugees but also economic migrants who come without any prior authorization? Are unregulated borders consistent with sovereignty? If migration is a fire starter for reactionary populism, which may burn hot enough to endanger democracy, is restriction defensible on the ground of self-preservation? Some immigration skeptics are xenophobes; many more fear the xenophobia of others. Despite realistic fears about our compatriots' baser instincts, do we still have an ethical obligation to support open borders?\n\nModern political philosophers have largely found extreme limitations on people's ability to migrate to be unjustifiable. Joseph Carens, perhaps the most prominent contemporary ethicist of immigration, is a full-throated advocate for open borders. \"In many ways, citizenship in Western democracies is the modern equivalent of feudal class privilege-an inherited status that greatly enhances one's life chances,\" he writes. If humans all have equal moral worth, how can it be fair to let the dumb luck of birth determine opportunity to such an extreme degree?\n\nIt's notable that neither John Rawls nor Robert Nozick, the past century's two greatest thinkers about the social contract, was eager to reckon with the matter of migration in his magnum opus. In \" A Theory of Justice ,\" Rawls argued that the rules ordering a just society are the ones we would agree to behind a veil of ignorance about our position in it. If the entire world could be placed behind one such veil, would it settle for the present-day system of tightly regulated borders? It seems unlikely, but Rawls dodged the issue by limiting his analysis to \"closed\" societies, in which migration was assumed away. In the book \" Anarchy, State, and Utopia ,\" Nozick sketched a vision for a minimalist state that prized property rights, but he did not consider the tricky business of people entering and exiting. Yet here, too, the logic may lead to openness. The minimally viable state in Nozick's utopia would be so emaciated, having ceded almost all its power to individual property owners, that it is unclear who could stop someone who sought to wed or employ an outsider. Carens takes these conundrums as evidence for his position: whatever account of political justice you adopt, it will confirm the moral necessity of open borders.\n\nJudging by the damage that Britain willingly inflicted on itself by leaving the European Union, which requires free movement among its members-or by the far-right parties that have sprung up in Germany and the Scandinavian countries in response to surges of refugees-I would guess that most societies would be ripped apart if they even came close to implementing the program that Carens recommends. Reihan Salam, the president of the conservative Manhattan Institute, pointedly titled his book on the subject \"Melting Pot or Civil War?\" Even Carens is quick to clarify that he is not \"making a policy proposal that I think might be adopted (in the immediate future) by presidents or prime ministers\"; he concedes that \"the idea of open borders is a nonstarter.\" But perhaps he should have the courage of his convictions: is the case for open borders obliged, morally, to reckon with its foreseeable political consequences?\n\nIn \" Immigration and Democracy \" (Oxford), Sarah Song, a professor of law and political science at Berkeley, offers an alternative to this depressing dialectic. \"It is not an exaggeration to say that the open borders position has emerged as the dominant normative position\" among her fellow political theorists, she writes. She offers calm and methodical critiques of the logic of open-borders advocates, whether they proceed from left, liberal, or libertarian foundations. If such a thing as global equality of opportunity can be conceived, open borders might not even be the best route to achieve it, she contends, because that approach \"would reinforce rather than ameliorate the economic vulnerability of people in poor countries.\" She disputes the idea of a fundamental human right to immigrate which would require the dismantling of the world's borders.\n\nWhen Song turns to constructing her own account of the state and its right to regulate movement into and out of its territory, she arrives at a middle road: \"What is required is not closed borders or open borders but controlled borders and open doors.\" Citizenship creates a special set of commitments that can be in tension with our humanitarian, universalist commitments. You cannot believe that people have the right to collective self-determination-a core principle of international law-without also ceding them the right to regulate a polity's membership. Indeed, she writes, \"part of what it means for a political community to be self-determining is that it controls whom to admit as new members.\" This is not, as some believe, an unquestionable right embedded in state sovereignty-which would sanction, for example, a revived Chinese Exclusion Act or the Trump Administration's so-called Muslim travel ban-because democratic norms against invidious discrimination should, she argues, constrain the state even when dealing with non-members. In some cases, like reunifying families or saving refugees, humanitarian considerations tip over into requiring admission rather than simply allowing it. What Song ends up constructing is an ethical basis for an immigration system that, with some reforms, America could plausibly achieve. A sigh of relief can be breathed.\n\nYou might wonder, as I sometimes did as a student taking classes on political theory, how much these thought exercises actually matter. Countries will continue to restrict immigration despite the opinions of professors-in exactly the same way that Vladimir Putin will continue to wage his unjust war on Ukraine no matter the protestations of just-war theorists. But political philosophy can take a long and circuitous route to practice. The great English philosopher John Locke published his \"Two Treatises on Government\" in 1689; a century later, it inspired Thomas Jefferson as he helped draft America's divorce letter to Britain. Karl Marx published \"Das Kapital\" half a century before Vladimir Lenin founded the Soviet Union. And so the intellectual contests held today may affect how future generations traverse whatever of the globe is left to them.\n\nIn the short term, it is easy to despair as nativist backlash recurs once again and borders militarize. But America today has forty-five million foreign-born residents-the most of any country, and as many as the next four combined. And Biden, loudly hawkish on unauthorized immigration, has quietly expanded the number of legal admissions, extending welcome to Ukrainians, Venezuelans, and Haitians fleeing war and chaos. Quietly, too, the economic dividends will accrue. In the U.S., opinion poll after opinion poll shows that immigrants are deeply optimistic about the course of their adopted country. Demographic transitions have often been marred by oppression and violence. If America's proceeds peacefully, it would mark success for one of the greatest experiments any democracy has ever tried, and help secure economic primacy over closed and sclerotic societies like China's.

      "text": "How Democrats Lost Their Way on Immigration\n\nDavid Leonhardt-who until recently ran the New York Times' flagship newsletter, \"The Morning\"-has been trying to understand what Democrats need to do to win elections again. He recently explored this issue at length in the Times Magazine. The story focusses on Denmark, where a center-left party has managed to achieve political success at a time when the far right is rising across Europe. Leonhardt attributes that success in large part to the party's willingness to pursue a restrictive immigration policy. He uses the story of Denmark to explain how and why he believes Democrats have struggled, and what the Party might do going forward. As he writes, \"For center-left parties around the world, Denmark offers a glimpse at what a different version of the left can look like-more working-class, more community-focused and more restrictive on immigration.\"\n\nI recently spoke by phone with Leonhardt, who is about to become an editorial director of the Times' Opinion section, and is the author of the book \" Ours Was the Shining Future .\" During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed why he thinks the Biden Administration stumbled on the immigration issue, why Barack Obama's relatively harsh immigration policies were not enough to prevent Donald Trump's rise, and how much the economic debate over immigration's effects on wages really matters to voters.\n\nOf all the issues that Democrats had real control over in 2024, do you think immigration was the one they screwed up the most?\n\nYes, and I think the second half of that is important. I think the Democrats had three really problematic issues. Inflation, which is probably the biggest, and I think they had some control over that, but it was limited. Then there was Biden's age and the notion that he and the people around him, including [Vice-President Kamala] Harris, weren't especially honest about it, and they probably had some control over that, too.\n\nYeah, they had some control over that.\n\nYes. And then the third is immigration. And under President Biden, we had the largest surge of immigration over a short period in American history. The pace was even faster than the peak pace of the Ellis Island years of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. We had eight million net immigrants come into the country. It appears that about five million of them entered illegally, a vastly faster pace than under Trump or Obama. You had Biden telling people during the 2020 campaign that he wanted more people to come to the country and then loosening a whole bunch of policies. Almost immediately, immigration surged. And it was never what most American voters wanted. It particularly was not what lower-income voters across races wanted. It was unpopular from the beginning. And it happened in large part-not exclusively, but in large part-because of the policies they enacted.\n\nDo you think part of the reason they enacted those policies is that polls were more positive on immigration when Biden's term started?\n\nDefinitely. But, when you look at the actual policies that he put in place, there was never reason to believe that they were popular. I've gone back and read every Democratic Party platform on immigration in the twenty-first century, and you see this pretty radical shift between 2012 and 2020. Under Obama, in 2012, it's this really balanced approach. It brags about having the border be more secure than at any point in the previous decades. It talks about deporting criminals who endanger our communities. It also, of course, talks about this being a nation of immigrants and needing to provide a citizenship pathway for undocumented people who follow the law. And it celebrates Dreamers and all of that stuff.\n\nAnd then it starts to move in 2016. And by 2020, there's not a single sentence in the Democratic Party platform on immigration that is about border security. All of the mentions of deportations are essentially negative, and it repeatedly talks about the idea that we should make it easier for people to enter the country. And, if you look at the polling, there's just no evidence that that is ever what Americans wanted. It was part of this broader shift to the left of the Democratic Party between roughly 2015 and 2020 to follow the wishes of very progressive, largely affluent members.\n\nIn the Times Magazine piece, regarding solutions for Democrats going forward, you write, \"There can be an answer that is both consistent with progressive values and politically sustainable. It was not so different from the answer that many Democrats, including Barack Obama, offered not long ago. It combined a hardheaded approach to border security and deportation with a celebration of immigrants and an effort to expand pathways to citizenship.\" During Obama's term, there was serious immigration enforcement. Border crossings were also declining compared to the Clinton and George W. Bush Administrations. What followed Obama's second term was the election of Donald Trump, who won the Presidency largely on anti-immigrant bigotry. If Obama was the way to immunize Democrats from these attacks, why didn't it work?\n\nThat's a really fair question. And I think there are two important responses. The first is that, even if Obama's moderation is much more popular than Biden's more radical position, Obama is still President during a period where, for the most part, immigration rules are loosening in this country. When I wrote my book, I spent a lot of time studying the 1965 immigration law. [ The law ended decades of bigoted immigration restrictions, which made admission determinations by country of origin. ] When Democrats and Republicans passed that law, they repeatedly promised that it wouldn't lead to a major immigration surge, and they were just wrong. They made promises they didn't keep, mostly because of the loophole in the law that allowed huge numbers of people to come as family members of immigrants. And in the decades that followed, we continued to have loosenings of U.S. immigration law. There's a new law in 2008 that makes it much easier for kids to enter the country. There's a judge's ruling in 2015 that also makes it easier for children to enter the country.\n\nAnd so I do think Obama in many ways adopted a more popular and more moderate tone. But I also think that there was lingering dissatisfaction among a lot of people about immigration because we had much higher immigration than our laws called for, than our politicians promised. And we had it during a period when inequality was rising and working-class incomes and living standards were stagnating. People were frustrated. And, even if they put too much blame on immigration, they were right to think that the government hadn't delivered the immigration policy it promised.\n\nAnother thing is that I think Barack Obama would have beaten Donald Trump if Obama had run in 2016. But Obama didn't run in 2016; Hillary Clinton did, and she didn't talk about immigration the way Obama did. She very much adopted this sort of élite-left social-justice language rather than more working-class language.\n\nDoes this suggest that it's the rhetoric and not the policy realities about immigration that really matter?\n\nI think it's both. When you go back and you read some of Obama's rhetoric on this, it's a little bit jarring when you compare it with the Democratic Party's today. Obama says, \"Passions fly on immigration, but I don't know anyone who benefits when a mother is separated from her infant child or an employer undercuts American wages by hiring illegal workers.\" And so I do think rhetoric matters a lot. I think the mistake that you sometimes see the progressive wing of the Democratic Party make, not just on immigration but on other subjects, is this notion that rhetoric is the only thing that matters and that, if somehow the Democratic Party were to decide to keep a whole bunch of policies that are clearly unpopular with most voters and mostly popular among relatively affluent voters, the Party can somehow make up for that by just using different rhetoric.\n\nThat is fair, but to have the Obama era end with Trump is just such a body blow to this idea that Democrats can immunize themselves from the far right if they take a moderate path on an issue like this.\n\nI think it's much harder to make that case because of just how much Hillary Clinton's message departed from Obama's. Every mention of deportation in the 2016 platform is negative. I'm not saying that most voters read the platform, but they did hear the many ways in which Hillary Clinton adopted the language of the academic left, not just on immigration but on a whole range of issues.\n\nYou write about how the academic left has hurt the messaging and policies of parties across the developed world. But are the parties that have struggled with the issue really part of the academic left? Germany has had Chancellors from both the Social Democratic Party and the center right in the past ten years, and it was the latter, Angela Merkel, who oversaw a huge rise in immigration.\n\nThat's part of why Denmark is so interesting to me. I agree with you that it's not just the Brahmin left that drove the shift toward a much more open immigration policy in the past several decades in Europe, the United States, and Canada. It's also the corporate right; business executives have always liked high immigration. It's been a consensus of mainstream parties that more immigration is some combination of desirable and inevitable. It's Angela Merkel in the center right, it's Tony Blair in the center left. In a lot of European countries, the share of the foreign-born population was around five per cent a few decades ago, and now it's often fifteen per cent. That's an extremely rapid and large shift.\n\nAnd what's so interesting about Denmark is: you have the center left say, No, we're really going to slow immigration down. We think the levels of immigration that we've had are bad for working-class people. We think they strain our social services, they strain our schools, they create more wage competition, and those costs fall overwhelmingly on working-class people. And so, to me, what's important about Denmark is that there was a party where people who were concerned about immigration could go that wasn't on the extreme right. And once the Danish center left provided that place, it really marginalized the far right.\n\nDenmark gets to some of the conversation we're having about rhetoric versus reality. You write that 12.6 per cent of the population is foreign born, up from 10.5 per cent when Mette Frederiksen, the current Prime Minister, took office. What really seems to have changed is the rhetoric and the harshness of the visible policies. So are people responding to the sense that their government is acting against migration, or are they responding to the actual rate of immigration in the country and how many immigrants they see around them? I guess I'm wary of this idea that voters have a deep knowledge of how many immigrants are in the country and what it's doing to their wages.\n\nI think it's both. Denmark borders Germany and is connected to Sweden by a bridge. The foreign-born population in Germany is almost twenty per cent. In Sweden it's above twenty per cent. And in Denmark, as you said, it's 12.6 per cent. That's not just a difference in rhetoric; that's a difference in reality.\n\nAbsolutely. But Denmark was also starting from a lower baseline than some of these other countries. And so I'm trying to figure out how much has actually changed under the center left and how much is rhetoric.\n\nIn a way that Americans may not fully grasp, crime is a huge part of the debate in Europe now. It's important to say that immigrants to the United States commit crimes at a lower rate than the native population in the United States. Donald Trump lies about that, and many Republicans lie about that, and they lie about it in really alarming ways. In Europe, the issue is a lot more complicated. And so I think one of the things that's really driven the debate in Germany and in Scandinavia is crime. Sweden now has the highest rate of gun homicide in the European Union. And immigrants commit a disproportionate share of crime there. People in Sweden see these gang shootings and are incredibly alarmed and afraid of them.\n\nIn the piece, you write, \"Many studies find a modestly negative effect on wages for people who already live in a country, falling mostly on low-income workers. A 2017 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, intended as a comprehensive analysis of the economic effects of immigration, contains a table listing rigorous academic studies that estimate immigration's effects on native wages; 18 of the 22 results are negative. The Brahmin left sometimes waves away these effects as too small to matter. The workers who experience them feel differently.\"\n\nThe co-chairs of the panel who oversaw this report summarized its findings as follows: \"The panel's comprehensive examination of the data on this contentious subject revealed many important benefits of immigration-including on economic growth, innovation, and entrepreneurship. And it found little to no negative effects on the overall wages or employment of native-born workers in the long term. Where negative wage impacts have been detected, native-born high school dropouts and prior immigrants are most likely to be affected.\" It's tough to read this and think that much of the anger about immigration is coming from these economic effects.\n\nFor the most part, academics are overwhelmingly positive about immigration. But the report did show a small, negative effect in eighteen of the twenty-two results. George Borjas, the Harvard professor who tends to be more skeptical of immigration than the other people on that committee, wrote a follow-up in which he essentially suggested that some of the language in the conclusion put its thumb on the scale.\n\nShould we assume that, all things equal, immigration has a negative effect on wages for working-class people? I think the answer is clearly yes. It would require repealing the laws of supply and demand for an expansion of the labor pool not to have a negative effect on wages. But I'm always a little bit loath to go into that detail because I don't think that wage effects are the main reason that rapid, large-scale immigration is unpopular virtually everywhere. Just in the past few years it's been unpopular in Europe, in the United States, in South Africa, in Canada, in Australia. I don't think it's about the wage effect. I think it's about the pace of change in communities.\n\nSo I talked about some elementary schools in Denmark where, in relatively short order, more than half the kids in kindergarten don't speak Danish. Think about what that does if you have a kid in that class. Think about the amount of turmoil it introduces. Think about the amount of time teachers have to spend on it. Listen to voters in places like Queens and the Bronx. Some of them voted for Trump, some of them voted for Harris. And they talked about the ways the Biden migration surge had put real strains on their community. I've watched the town halls in places like the West Side of Chicago and in Denver during the last few years. People were really upset about it. People in Manhattan were upset about the chaos around the Roosevelt Hotel, in midtown.\n\nIt's about the pace of change. It's about strains on social services. Yes, it is sometimes about racism and xenophobia, without question. And the Republican Party in this country has absolutely used racist and xenophobic messaging. And I think that's really important to say. But large-scale immigration is often unpopular among people of the same race as the arriving immigrants. We've seen that in the past decade in Taiwan, in South Africa, in Europe, in Texas, in New York City, and in a lot of other places.\n\nI agree that migrants arriving in large numbers in American cities is not a good thing for Democrats. I think it would be pretty silly to argue the opposite. But, fundamentally speaking, these New Yorkers and other big-city residents upset about migrants-some of them voted for Trump, but they are not the main reason he won. And most of the areas in this country that have negative feelings more broadly toward immigrants do not have a ton of immigrants in them. So I'm wary of concluding that the major problem isn't racism and the way immigration is hyped in right-wing media.\n\nI think we're going to wait a long time before our media is fixed.\n\nI think you're right.\n\nIf the Democratic Party basically says, Well, we're not going to moderate our position, which has clearly been unpopular on this issue, until we've repealed Citizens United and got rid of Fox News, I think they're going to spend a lot of time out of power.\n\nYes, but Biden and Harris did in 2024 moderate their position, right?\n\nThey did. I think that's a really important thing to think about for a minute because I know a lot of Democrats feel like it was deeply unfair that they shifted on this and didn't get credit for it. But I understand why a lot of voters were skeptical. Biden and Harris never acknowledged their role in causing the surge. They never acknowledged that they were changing their position. They never apologized. They never acknowledge the cost in places like South Texas or on the West Side of Chicago. And, you know, Harris basically wouldn't answer the question of why she changed her position.\n\nYes, she changed her position and also kept being asked whether the Administration had made any mistakes, and she refused to say it was a mistake. The answer is sitting right there.\n\nExactly. Look at the Democrats who won tough races: Elissa Slotkin, in Michigan; Ruben Gallego, in Arizona; Tammy Baldwin, in Wisconsin; Jacky Rosen, in Nevada; and then a whole bunch of House members. Almost all of them ran really hawkish messages on immigration that often blamed the Biden Administration. And so there are ways for Democrats to win with a message of border security.\n\nO.K., so you thought the Obama message was pretty good fifteen years ago. But how do you think about what that message should look like now in a way that doesn't drift into racism? And especially now because we're seeing really horrible things happen to immigrants on the news on a nightly basis.\n\nTrump is going to overreach. He is going to treat immigrants cruelly in ways that most Americans will not support. He did so eight years ago, and he's doing so again. And that's going to create an opportunity for Democrats. After the chaos of the Biden years, when you looked at polls, you saw that people were deeply unhappy with Biden's policy and really wanted the level of immigration to be cut in this country. But still more Americans said that immigration was more of a strength of our country than a weakness.\n\nI think the problem has been that you have had this élite wing of the Democratic Party that has argued that immigration is a free lunch and has been pretty disdainful of the concerns of working-class people of all races. You actually did an interview with someone from an immigration think tank in which he claimed that immigration is all benefit and no cost, which is a remarkable claim, and it's not consistent with the evidence. Immigration has huge benefits, and it really does have meaningful costs. And those costs fall disproportionately on working-class people. And so I don't know exactly what a winning message on immigration is, but it's going to have to be one that is more moderate than what the Party's has been and one that acknowledges the complications that immigration has huge benefits both for immigrants and for the country but it also has meaningful downsides. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Finally, a Leap Forward on Immigration Policy\n\nThe American immigration system has been called many unsavory things, most of them deserved. It was last reformed thirty-four years ago. What has emerged in the decades since is a welter of backlogs, visa shortages, piecemeal enforcement measures, and every manner of bureaucratic complexity. Ordinary people, trying to work and take care of their families, are often forced into surreal scenarios. Take the 1.1 ­million people in this country who are married to U.S. citizens but are undocumented themselves. You might assume that it would be relatively straightforward for them to get on firm legal footing. In fact, the process is quite complicated. Anyone who first entered the United States illegally must travel to another country for a visa interview at a U.S. Embassy or consulate. But if she has lived in the United States for more than a year without papers, as some eleven million people have, a law in place since the nineteen-­nineties bars her from reëntering the country for up to a decade. That could mean, in effect, getting stranded outside the U.S., despite having a partner, possibly children, and a livelihood here. She can get a waiver permitting her to remain in the U.S. if she can prove that her prolonged absence would cause \"extreme hardship\" for certain members of her family. But, because of processing delays, getting the waiver can now take three and a half years.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, at the White House, President Joe Biden announced the most consequential act of immigration relief in more than a decade. He gave roughly half a million undocumented spouses of citizens a path to permanent legal status, on the condition that they have lived here since at least 2014 and pass a criminal-­background check. \"I refuse to believe that to secure our border we have to walk away from being American,\" Biden said. \"The Statue of Liberty is not some relic of American history.\"\n\nThe measure, known as parole in place, is part of a broader executive power dating from the early nineteen-fifties, which every President since then has exercised to grant special protection to particular categories of people. Biden has made liberal use of his parole authority, allowing more than a million people to enter the country in the past three years, about a quarter of whom have been displaced Ukrainians and Afghans. Republicans have attacked Biden for using this power too broadly, and there's no question that the Administration has been creative. Last year, to reduce unauthorized crossings at the southern border, the Department of Homeland Security developed a parole program that has admitted more than four hundred thousand Venezuelans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Cubans who had financial sponsors in the United States. Conservative state attorneys general filed a lawsuit to block the program, but in March it was dismissed in a federal district court. There will almost certainly be legal challenges to Biden's latest policy, too.\n\nSome Administration officials who knew about the parole-in-place policy were unsure that the President would go through with it until they received an invitation to the announcement. He has spent much of the past year charting a resolutely centrist course as views on immigration have hardened among Democrats and Republicans alike. Two weeks earlier, Biden had issued an executive proclamation curtailing asylum at the southern border. This followed the failure of a Senate bill to restrict asylum, which Republicans abandoned under pressure from Donald Trump. Biden called the lawmakers \"most pathetic\" and \"petty.\" To reinforce his point-that he was pragmatic, his opponents cynical-the President made his asylum proclamation harsher than the Senate bill.\n\nThe problem for Biden was that his efforts still weren't registering with the electorate. Polls show that voters consider immigration to be one of the most serious problems facing the country, and they now trust Republicans more than Democrats to handle the situation. They appear to have forgotten the chaos and the anguish of the Trump era, from the separation of families at the border to a travel ban denying entry to anyone from seven Muslim-majority countries.\n\nEarlier this year, the polling firm Equis turned to a question that has been increasingly troubling Democrats: Why are so many Latinos, once a fairly dependable bloc of Democratic support, reporting that they prefer Trump and the Republicans to Biden and the Democrats on immigration policy? In one subset of results, Latinos in battleground states said that they were more concerned about Democrats' \"broken promises\" than they were about Republicans' \"extreme measures.\" Those findings reinforce the fact that the President, in trying to prove his enforcement bona fides at the border, hasn't managed to communicate policy successes in other areas: he has increased legal immigration, restored a refugee program that was decimated by Trump, and reduced unnecessary immigration arrests in the interior of the country.\n\nIn addition, immigrants'-rights advocates have spent much of Biden's Presidency trying to persuade him to take actions known as affirmative relief-policies that he can adopt, without congressional approval, to provide direct aid to vulnerable populations. The model is Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA , which President Barack Obama introduced in 2012, to shield from deportation some eight hundred thousand immigrants who had come to this country as young children. The program, which allowed them to work, study, and support their families, was an overwhelming success and has remained highly popular across the political spectrum. Trump tried to cancel it anyway, in 2017, and subsequent lawsuits brought by Republicans led a federal judge in the Southern District of Texas to block new applications.\n\nThose who have been trying to make the case for Biden to do more went looking for a new policy, like DACA , that could have a significant impact and win broad political support. Another finding from the Equis poll was so striking, in this regard, that the pollsters and several advocates shared it at meetings this spring with Biden's top advisers: some seventy per cent of voters supported an action that gave relief to undocumented spouses. The President cited this figure when he announced the plan and repeated a phrase that had the virtue of not only polling well but making sound moral sense: Democrats, he said, were \"keeping families together.\"\n\nThe new policy is a rare bit of unqualified good news. But it is also a reminder of the paradox of U.S. immigration policy: each act of relief underlines everything that hasn't been done, both to make the system as a whole more equitable and to allow millions of people living in legal limbo a chance to settle their status once and for all. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "The Unchecked Authority of Trump's Immigration Orders\n\nThe President is recasting migration as a form of \"invasion,\" broadening his already expansive powers and making anyone in the U.S. who's undocumented a potential target.\n\nIn the months before the election, Donald Trump's allies and advisers repeatedly claimed that, if he won a second term, his first day in office would immediately overwhelm the efforts of any organized opposition. \"The A.C.L.U. won't know where to sue first,\" one of them told me. Within twenty-four hours of Trump's Inauguration, twenty-two states, two cities, and a group of nonprofits, including the A.C.L.U., filed lawsuits to block one of a dozen immigration-related executive orders that Trump signed on Monday. The order, called \"Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,\" would not only end birthright citizenship, which has been enshrined in U.S. law for more than a century; it would also deny the \"privilege of United States citizenship\" to the children of parents who lived in the country legally but didn't have green cards or citizenship status themselves. At a press briefing organized by the Federalist Society, John Yoo, the former Justice Department lawyer whose maximalist view of executive power was the basis for the Bush Administration's use of torture during the war on terror, said , \"This one, I think, is the most legally tenuous, and it's going to invite a huge fight that could tie up the Administration in knots.\" On Thursday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the order, calling it \"blatantly unconstitutional.\"\n\nStill, as legal analysts and immigration experts scrambled to parse the language of the new orders, they had little choice but to triage on a Trumpian continuum, where, in many cases, actions that would have seemed unfathomable just years or even months before were now regarded as essentially normal. Others were more obviously alarming. Under an order called \"Clarifying the Military's Role in Protecting the Territorial Integrity of the United States,\" the Department of Defense might not simply assist federal immigration authorities to provide provisional detention space for migrants or to conduct logistical tasks at the border, as it has in the past. Instead, the President was now calling on active-duty troops to carry out a \"mission to seal the borders and maintain the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and security of the United States by repelling forms of invasion including unlawful mass migration.\" Specifically, the order calls for a new Unified Command Plan  to be drawn up within ten days. \"That potentially takes things to another level,\" Elizabeth Goitein, a national-security expert at the Brennan Center for Justice, told me. \"This at least seems to contemplate military operations at the border. It's completely unexpected and pretty outrageous.\"\n\nThe Lede Reporting and commentary on what you need to know today.\n\nA central theme in all of Trump's immigration orders is recasting migration as a form of \"invasion.\" As a piece of political rhetoric, the word has become numbingly histrionic. But as a legal notion, in the world of these executive orders, it triggers a response that goes far beyond the President's already broad powers to manage immigration. Both Trump and President Joe Biden have sought to bar entry to asylum seekers through an expansive reading of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which is the main statute covering federal immigration law. These new orders aim to cast aside the I.N.A. and allow Trump to seek recourse in the Constitution as a President defending his country from a foreign threat. \"He has entered into fairly undefined legal territory by invoking the Constitution to potentially supersede the entire I.N.A. and create a wide enforcement scope over the people, government, and nonstate actors who may have carried out this supposed invasion,\" Andrea Flores, a former White House official and border expert, told me.\n\nMany of these orders reinforce the fiction that mass migration constitutes some kind of war. At the moment, following months of sharply declining numbers of migrants at the border, the government is arresting fewer people than it did in the final months of Trump's first term. Even in late 2023, when there was a legitimate crisis, with two hundred and fifty thousand people apprehended by Border Patrol  in the month of December alone, the idea that the country was in the midst of a hostile foreign takeover would have been absurd. Another of Trump's Day One orders designates \"the Cartels\" in Mexico, as well as Tren de Aragua and MS-13, two gangs that are respectively associated with Venezuela and El Salvador, as \"foreign terrorist organizations.\" The cartels \"function as quasi-governmental entities, controlling nearly all aspects of society,\" according to the order. The other gangs \"are extraordinarily violent, vicious, and similarly threaten the stability of the international order.\" Most of these groups, especially the Mexican cartels, are involved in drug smuggling and human trafficking, but labelling them as terrorists widens the scope of the Administration's enforcement options. Revealingly, the order about cartels and gangs makes reference to the Alien Enemies Act, a remnant of the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798. This law could apply only if Congress declared war or if the President claimed that a foreign government was threatening to invade or attack; he could then detain and deport legal permanent residents and others who are here lawfully if they are from  countries that are considered \"enemies\" of the U.S. government.\n\nTrump and his top immigration adviser, Stephen Miller, have threatened to use the Alien Enemies Act as well as the Insurrection Act, which would employ the military in policing domestic protest; in these executive orders, Trump does not invoke either act officially, but he demonstrates that they are under serious consideration. In one order, he asks the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, and State to make preparations for his possible use of the Alien Enemies Act; in another, he instructs the D.H.S. and the Department of Defense to provide recommendations on the Insurrection Act. \"Some of the executive orders are so off base either on the law or on practical implementation that you have to interpret them as messaging statements,\" Goitein told me. \"Because the President has inherent constitutional authority to repel sudden attacks or invasions, he's presumably trying to signal that this is a military operation rather than a law-enforcement operation. The problem is that unlawful migration doesn't constitute an 'invasion' as a legal matter.\"\n\nBut even the Day One orders that were widely anticipated will have a profound impact. One was the declaration of a \"national emergency\" at the border, which Trump had also done in 2019, after Congress refused to appropriate more money for his border wall; now as then, the declaration would enable him to free up funding for construction while also enlisting troops to assist immigration authorities. By Wednesday, the Pentagon announced that it was sending fifteen hundred troops to the border \"to address the full range of threats outlined by the President.\" It was equally unsurprising that Trump halted the U.S. refugee program, which the Biden Administration had rebuilt after its dismantling during Trump's first term. More than ten thousand refugees who'd been cleared to fly to the U.S for resettlement, including sixteen hundred Afghans who were fleeing their country, primarily because of past ties to U.S. forces, were left in limbo. Trump also undid a program started under the Biden Administration that relied on the President's parole authorities to manage the entry of more than half a million people from Venezuela, Haiti, Cuba, and Nicaragua. Each day for roughly the past two years, an additional thousand asylum seekers have been able to schedule appointments at ports of entry along the U.S.-Mexico border through a government app called CBP One. Trump cancelled the app, stranding thousands of people who'd been waiting in northern Mexico. The father of a family of three, who were stuck in Ciudad Juárez, told Arelis Hernández, of the Washington Post , \"After everything we've done and gone through to get here . . . if only I had had the appointment for three hours earlier.\"\n\nAs Trump was cancelling Biden-era policies, he was also reinstating others from his own first term. The Migrant Protection Protocols, commonly called Remain in Mexico, which forced tens of thousands of asylum seekers to wait indefinitely in northern Mexico, are back in place, as is a form of extreme vetting meant to block visas and other forms of entry for immigrants from certain countries. Ideas from Trump's first term that either had minimal impact or never materialized-such as a registry of noncitizens and a government hotline for victims of crimes committed by immigrants-have reappeared. But this time measures like the travel ban were replaced by more methodical reviews and preparatory actions that could serve as the precursors to such policies while putting them on more solid legal footing. I asked a senior congressional aide what was most surprising. \"The fact that they're pacing themselves with the country bans,\" the person replied.\n\nWhile these orders were being signed, four high-ranking career officials at the Executive Office for Immigration Review, the country's top immigration court, which is run out of the Department of Justice, were fired. Tom Jawetz, a top lawyer at the D.H.S. in the Biden Administration, told the Times that it was \"a Day 1 blood bath.\" The new Administration is already clearing out the civil servants who were seen as impediments to Trump's first-term agenda.\n\nIn the days before the Inauguration, amid rumors of mass arrests in Democratic cities across the country, people stayed home in fear, much like they had at the start of 2017. This time expectations are worse, owing to the fact that Trump successfully campaigned on the promise of carrying out mass deportations. Reports of expected operations in Chicago, fuelled in part by the remarks made by members of the incoming Administration, led to a fifty-per-cent decline in foot traffic in one of the city's busiest retail corridors, according to the head of the local Chamber of Commerce. \"It's going to be disastrous,\" she told Bloomberg . \"If raids happen and people are too afraid to go out, it's going to be an impact that's going to last for years.\"\n\nUnder Biden, in a refinement of a policy begun during the Obama Administration, immigration authorities had a series of priorities for deciding whom to target for arrest from among the estimated eleven million undocumented people living across the country. \"Their priorities were violent criminals and recent arrivals,\" Muzaffar Chishti, of the Migration Policy Institute, told me. \"If a person hadn't committed a crime and didn't have an order of removal against him, it was relatively certain he wouldn't get deported.\" As part of the new slate of executive orders, Trump has scrapped this approach, meaning anyone who's undocumented is a potential target. The randomness of who might be vulnerable to arrest has been an ostensible point of pride for Tom Homan, the President's new \"border czar,\" who ran Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) during the first Trump term. Back in 2017, Homan told Congress, \"if you're in this country illegally and you committed a crime by being in this country, you should be uncomfortable, you should look over your shoulder.\" (After Trump's reëlection, he added , \"If you want to self-deport, you should self-deport because, again, we know who you are, and we're going to come and find you.\") A policy under which ICE refrained from making arrests at hospitals, schools, and places of worship, known as \"sensitive locations,\" has been cancelled.\n\nAn executive order called \"Protecting the American People Against Invasion\" provided a detailed preview of the new Administration's priorities for enforcement in the interior of the country. So-called sanctuary cities and states that have limited their coöperation with ICE would be penalized. But the order also described efforts to audit federal funding for N.G.O.s that provide services either \"directly or indirectly\" to \"removable or illegal aliens\"; to begin a critical review of the long-standing designation called Temporary Protected Status , which currently covers hundreds of thousands of immigrants; and to consider sanctions against \"recalcitrant countries\" that might not accept U.S. deportation flights.\n\nOn Monday, while Trump signed his executive orders in the Oval Office, he fielded questions from the press, one of which was about a comment he'd made to Sean Hannity in 2023. \"Are you a dictator on Day One?\" the journalist asked. \"No, no,\" Trump said. \"I can't even imagine being called that.\" Armed for the first time in his career with a popular mandate, albeit a slim one, he could now claim that he was giving the public what it wanted. The A.C.L.U. could sue him on the particulars, and, presumably, it will continue to. But, politically, who was ready to actually challenge him?\n\nThe real mark of Trump's new powers may not have been in the executive orders at all but in a Senate vote cast later that evening. Twelve Democrats, including some who have recently won reëlection, joined Republicans in passing the Laken Riley Act, named for a Georgia nursing student who was murdered by a Venezuelan immigrant early last year. The law would require the detention of any undocumented immigrant charged with (but not convicted of) crimes including shoplifting or minor theft. Another provision allows state attorneys general to sue the U.S. Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security if an immigrant paroled into the country commits a crime judged to harm the state or any of its residents physically or financially. \"This bill does nothing at all to address any of the actual problems associated with the U.S. immigration system,\" Flores, the former White House official, told me. Congressional Republicans were baffled that the Democrats caved so quickly. It will be the first bill Trump signs into law. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "The Immigration Story Nobody Is Talking About\n\nLast week, President Joe Biden announced a crackdown on migrants trying to cross the southern border. The responses from immigrants'-rights groups, civil-rights groups, and some Democratic politicians were instantaneous. Senator Alex Padilla, of California, said that the new policy-which empowers border agents to quickly deport people who cross between ports of entry, by drastically restricting their ability to claim asylum-\"undermined American values and abandoned our nation's obligations to provide people fleeing persecution, violence, and authoritarianism with an opportunity to seek refuge in the U.S.\"\n\nBut at least one economist, who strongly favors liberal immigration policies, was more sympathetic to the White House's move. \"The situation at the southern border has been chaotic,\" Giovanni Peri, who directs the Global Migration Center at the University of California, Davis, told me. \"It has been hurting the case for immigration because people have only been talking about that, and not talking about all the migrants who have been coming here and working and boosting the economy.\"\n\nMichael Clemens, an economist at George Mason University who is an expert on immigration, said that some of the coverage of the new policy, particularly online, had been misleading. Under certain exceptions enumerated in the plan, at least sixty thousand migrants-with access to parole pending an asylum or other court hearing-are likely to be lawfully admitted to the U.S. each month, about six times as many as under Donald Trump , Clemens said. \"This is not a return to Trump,\" he told me. \"There is no comparison.\" Biden's plan, which went into effect on Wednesday, does limit most asylum claims for migrants crossing between ports of entry, until the daily average of migrant arrests falls and stays below certain thresholds. But Clemens pointed out that migrants could still schedule appointments to appear at border posts, or could apply under a separate, special admissions program that the Biden Administration has set up for residents of Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. Nevertheless, he and Peri both agreed that there is an urgent need to accompany the new policy with more legal-entry options for the migrants who are trying to cross the southern border. \"We can easily absorb these people, and the economy needs them,\" Peri said. Clemens also argued that expanding legal channels is necessary to secure the border: \"Just denying access is very likely to encourage more clandestine entry. It may be completely ineffective.\"\n\nAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, net immigration to the U.S. surged to 2.6 million in 2022 and 3.3 million in 2023, and the majority of this increase came in the form of migrants who were granted parole either pending an asylum hearing or for other reasons. In a much discussed paper that was published a few months ago, Wendy Edelberg and Tara Watson, two economists at the Brookings Institution, argued that the entry of many of these new migrants into the U.S. helped enable the economy to grow and increased total employment, even as the Fed raised interest rates sharply to bring down inflation. New migrants contribute to economic growth in two ways: by working and by spending. Their presence in unexpectedly high numbers \"explains some of the surprising strength in consumer spending and overall economic growth since 2022,\" Edelberg and Watson wrote. \"Moreover, we expect immigration flows to further boost economic growth in 2024.\"\n\nWhen I called up Edelberg, she said it was hard to predict exactly what impact the new border policy would have. But, if it worked out as planned, the policy would eventually reduce the number of people seeking asylum only by about twenty-five per cent. \"What Biden is doing is relatively modest in relation to the broader economy,\" Edelberg said. \"It's not nothing, but it's not going to have a dramatic effect immediately.\"\n\nThis analysis illustrates a more general point about immigration policy, which right-wing politicians have ruthlessly demagogued for decades. The tropes that tend to dominate public discussion often have little basis in fact, and the facts that should be at the center of the discussion often go ignored. Take, for example, the claim often made by Republicans that the country is being \"swamped\" by migrants crossing the southern border. It's certainly true that a surge in unauthorized immigration during the past couple of years has created considerable challenges for communities in border states, and for cities such as New York and Chicago, which have received large inflows of migrants. But it is barely mentioned that this recent surge-which is largely rooted in people fleeing poverty and dysfunction in troubled Latin American countries, such as Honduras, Guatemala, and Venezuela-comes after a decade in which the number of unauthorized immigrants living in the United States declined.\n\nAccording to recent estimates by the Department of Homeland Security, in 2010 there were 11.6 million unauthorized immigrants in the United States. In 2022, there were eleven million. So, even though the number of unauthorized arrivals has risen sharply in the past couple of years, this follows a period in which large numbers of undocumented immigrants returned home, especially to Mexico, causing the over-all number still living here to fall slightly. It's also true that during the past two decades the number of foreign-born people living in the United States has increased significantly-from 31.1 million in 2000 to 46.2 million in 2022, according to the Census Bureau. But legal immigration has accounted for most of this jump, and many of the arrivals have been skilled workers. \"Since 2000, net immigration has become massively more concentrated among highly educated workers,\" Peri, of the Global Migration Center, pointed out.\n\nTo be sure, many of the migrants crossing the southern border don't have an advanced education. But two more unsung realities are relevant here. Based on news coverage, particularly on television, it's easy to get the impression that most of the migrants are unable to work and are languishing in taxpayer-funded shelters. That impression is almost certainly inaccurate. Migrants who have been given asylum-processing appointments or granted humanitarian parole are eligible to apply for temporary work permits. \"Looking at payroll-employment data, it is very consistent with high labor-participation rates among recent migrants,\" Edelberg said. \"They appear to be working in a very similar pattern to other recent waves of immigration.\" Some commentators have queried this argument, saying there is little evidence of a jump in over-all financial remittances by migrants to their home countries. Edelberg said that the remittances data merely suggest to her that \"brand-new migrants aren't yet sending a lot of money home.\"\n\nThe second important reality is that, in the coming decades, we are going to need many more of these types of workers to keep the U.S. economy growing and to fill essential jobs in industries such as construction, agriculture, food processing, hospitality, and long-term care. The potential shortage of workers is based on inexorable demographic trends: declining fertility rates and the aging of the U.S. population. According to this year's Economic Report of the President, which is prepared by the White House Council of Economic Advisers, between 2023 and 2052, the share of workers aged twenty-five to fifty-four is expected to grow at an average annual rate of just 0.2 per cent. That's a fifth of the growth rate between 1980 and 2021. And even this puny 0.2 per-cent rate depends on large numbers of new immigrants arriving year after year. \"Without positive net migration, the U.S. population is projected to begin shrinking by about 2040,\" the report said.\n\nSustaining healthy economic growth alongside a stable or declining population is theoretically conceivable: it would depend on making existing workers significantly more productive every year. A.I. optimists would say that should be possible. But the experience of Japan, where the population has declined in the past decade and a half, and where economic growth has stagnated, demonstrates the challenge that the United States would face if immigration was severely curtailed, as Trump and other Republicans have called for. \"Our economy needs immigrants to grow over the long term,\" Edelberg said. \"What we really need to do is open up more pathways for legal immigration.\"\n\nPeri emphasized the importance of making such pathways readily available not only to highly trained workers, such as computer engineers headed to Silicon Valley, but also to the types of migrants who have been crossing the southern border. During the past few years, labor shortages have already emerged in parts of the economy where low-skilled immigrants tend to work, such as construction and elderly care. (Earlier this year, the Associated Builders and Contractors trade group said that the industry would need to attract half a million workers beyond its usual rate of hiring to meet demand in 2024.) \"In the next ten or twenty years, it will be even more important to do proper and comprehensive immigration reform,\" Peri said. \"If we only deal with border security and don't do anything about expanding legal immigration, we are not really doing anything.\" ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Trump's Dangerous Immigration Obsession\n\nDonald Trump 's most outrageous pronouncements on immigration are rarely shocking for long; they're usually eclipsed within days, if not hours, by even more grotesque claims. Last year, in what should have been an enduring political scandal, Trump blamed immigrants for \"poisoning the blood of our country.\" He has repeated his solution-mass deportation-so often that it's become a campaign slogan. In a national Scripps News/Ipsos poll last month, fifty-four per cent of those asked agreed, either \"strongly\" or \"somewhat,\" with Trump's call, including a quarter of Democrats. Maybe people can't imagine what an action like that would entail; or, worse, maybe they can.\n\nEither way, the acceptance of such hostile thinking is, at least in part, a function of how relentlessly Trump and his running mate, J. D. Vance , lay all America's problems at immigrants' feet. Mass deportation isn't just their immigration platform; it's their response to questions about affordable housing, the economy, and inflation. Last month, Trump said of undocumented immigrants that \"getting them out will be a bloody story.\" There was hardly time to parse his meaning before he was standing on a Presidential-debate stage, in Philadelphia, lying about Haitians in Springfield, Ohio. Those remarks, compounded by Vance, were followed by a period of local terror that has included bomb scares, classroom evacuations, and pleas for sanity from the state's Republican governor. All the while, Trump continued to fulminate on the stump. \"These migrants,\" he said at a rally in Wisconsin, \"are stone-cold killers. They'll walk into your kitchen, they'll cut your throat.\" Last Thursday, in Michigan, he claimed that the government wasn't providing relief after Hurricane Helene , because Kamala Harris and the Democrats \"stole the fema money\" so that they \"could give it to their illegal immigrants that they want to have vote for them.\"\n\nThe daily stream of racism and mendacity has had a numbing effect. What hasn't Trump said at this point? But the question of what he might actually do, should he win, is a prospect that voters cannot afford to ignore. Trump's top immigration adviser, Stephen Miller , has announced that, if the former President is reëlected, the government will deport a million people a year. Given the expense and the bureaucratic complexity alone, this projection appears unrealistic, yet that scarcely makes it less dangerous.\n\nLast summer, Jason Houser, who served as a senior official at Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the Biden Administration, tried to map out what, logistically, a mass-deportation program might look like. His main focus was on the early days, when Trump wouldn't have nearly enough detention space to hold those apprehended in nationwide sweeps. While the Administration ramped up its capabilities, it could compensate by instilling fear. If enough people were intimidated, some might feel that they had no choice but to leave the country. The guiding idea, as Houser saw it, would be to weaponize ICE against families in order to inflict maximum pain in the most conspicuous way. \"This won't just be something at the border,\" he said. \"It'll be boys and girls in your kid's classes at school who just stop showing up.\"\n\nThere are more than eleven million undocumented immigrants living in the United States, and government agents have enormous latitude in whom they decide to arrest. Current policy discourages ICE from apprehending anyone at hospitals, schools, or places of worship. As a top adviser at the White House during Trump's Presidency, Miller wanted ICE , in the words of someone present at a meeting with him, \"to pull children out of school.\" Career officials at the Department of Homeland Security opposed Miller's plans, but Trump has since vowed to rid the government of such people in a second term. Enforcement would be indiscriminate and unpredictable, turning anyone who is undocumented into a potential target.\n\nIn the final years of the Obama Presidency, immigration authorities developed a policing strategy designed to spare from arrest millions of undocumented immigrants who hadn't been convicted of crimes. When Trump took office, in 2017, he immediately ended that approach. The primary reason that there weren't more deportations was the considerable resistance of local and state officials to coöperate with ICE . Joe Biden revived the Obama-era strategy. But, if Trump gets back into the White House, it's reasonable to expect that he will launch raids in Democratic cities and penalize recalcitrant jurisdictions by cutting off federal funds.\n\nOf all the repugnant statements that Trump and his allies have made, the most revealing may have come from Vance. At a campaign event in North Carolina, he explained why he kept referring to Haitians in Springfield as \"illegal\" when, in fact, they are here legally, as a result of two federal policies that have been upheld in court, despite Republican efforts to dismantle them. \"If Kamala Harris waves the wand illegally and says these people are now here legally, I'm still going to call them an illegal alien,\" Vance said. \"An illegal action from Kamala Harris does not make an alien legal.\"\n\nBy that logic, existing legal protections and court judgments would be moot. After the Trump Administration separated some five thousand children from their parents at the border, in 2017 and 2018, a federal judge ordered the government to reunite them, and forbade further separations for the next eight years as part of a federal settlement signed in December. If reëlected, will Trump simply ignore that? Hundreds of parents who were reunited with their children under the court order, but still lack permanent status, might well be deported.\n\nThey're just one group among many that are especially vulnerable. Since Biden has been in office, the federal government has allowed more than a million people fleeing persecution and extreme hardship to enter the country legally, under an executive power known as parole, including seventy-seven thousand Afghans and more than five hundred thousand Venezuelans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Cubans. Trump has already said that he'd revoke their status and that they should \"get ready to leave.\" There are nearly a million other people who have Temporary Protected Status, which allows them to work legally while renewing their papers every eighteen months; a large share of them have lived in the U.S. for more than two decades. Several hundred thousand immigrants who came here as children also have a provisional legal status: Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA .\n\nWhat all these individuals have in common is that they willingly shared information with the U.S. government. Because of the deadlock in Congress, there's nothing they can do to gain permanent status, so, when Obama and Biden created a legal opportunity, they took it. The outcome of the election may now determine whether such trust in the Presidency was misplaced. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

At Vox, our mission is to help everyone access essential information that empowers them. Support our journalism by becoming a member today .\n\nThese are uncertain times for many immigrants in the US.\n\nThere have been reports of individual visa and green card holders and tourists who have been detained and deported. However, the Trump administration does not seem to be indiscriminately targeting legal immigrants who have authorization to be in the US on a large scale.\n\nSome have reportedly been targeted based on their political activism. A Brown University professor and doctor with a green card was deported after officials found photos of former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Iran's supreme leader on her phone. Immigration authorities also invoked a Trump executive order prohibiting antisemitism to detain a former Columbia student and green card holder who helped lead campus protests over the war in Gaza.\n\nIn other cases, the Trump administration hasn't clarified its rationale for detaining someone. A German citizen with a green card was interrogated by border officials in Boston and detained without access to his anxiety medication. It's not clear if the government has charged him with a crime. Similarly, the administration had not offered an official explanation for detaining a Turkish doctoral student as of Tuesday.\n\nAnd it's not just immigrants who have been affected. A US citizen said he was walking down the streets of Chicago when he was arrested by immigration agents, who confiscated his ID and held him for 10 hours before releasing him.\n\nEven though limited in number, these cases have been going viral - and are understandably causing fear in immigrant communities.\n\nAccording to immigration attorneys, it's hard to tell how worried immigrants who are legally living and working in the US need to be.\n\n\"After practicing for 40 years, it's really difficult to divine what a measured response is right now,\" said Kathleen Campbell Walker, former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association.\n\nSo far, cases of individuals with visas and green cards being detained or deported appear rare. That said, the lawyers I spoke with advised these immigrants, as well as US citizens, to consider certain precautions in an environment of such uncertainty.\n\nLegal non-citizen immigrants have long been legally required to carry their immigration papers at all times. However, the penalties for failing to do so are becoming higher under Trump.\n\nIn April, the Trump administration is expected to increase the associated fines from $100 to $5,000, Campbell Walker said. Failing to possess documentation is a misdemeanor. That could now land an immigrant in detention and deportation proceedings; Trump revoked the Biden administration's immigration enforcement priorities so that even people charged with nonviolent, minor crimes can now be deported.\n\nRelatedly, next month the Trump administration will also start requiring all noncitizens to register with the federal government and designate those who fail to do so as a priority for immigration enforcement. Many noncitizens who have had previous contact with the federal government - whether because they applied for certain immigration benefits or were issued a notice to appear in immigration court - are already considered registered under the new policy.\n\nCampbell Walker said US citizens should also consider carrying a passport card that fits in their wallet, or birth certificate, as proof of their nationality, given the reports of Americans swept up in Trump's immigration enforcement activities. In some of these cases, she said, there have been concerns that immigration agents are racially and ethnically profiling their targets.\n\n\"Carrying documents on your person, making sure that people who are not citizens or naturalized or acquired citizens have one place in your home where you have all your important documentation together and making sure that you have copies - those are all reasonable and important steps to be taking in a moment like this, when we see the administration attacking free speech rights and attacking the basic norms of due process,\" said Heidi Altman, vice president of policy at the National Immigration Law Center.\n\nImmigration attorneys are urging immigrants to exercise caution in traveling abroad right now.\n\nFollowing the deportation of one of their professors, Brown University advised \" out of an abundance of caution \" that even green card holders delay any personal travel outside the US. The university said that changes in requirements to reenter the country and a draft proposal for a travel ban targeting 43 countries that could be implemented as early as this week might impact its students and staff.\n\n\"I believe that a lot of green card holders are making the decision to consult with an attorney before traveling, and I think that's a reasonable consideration,\" Altman said.\n\nImmigrants should consider whether their country of origin or where they are planning to travel may be on the list of countries that could be subjected to travel bans. They should also weigh their own history of activism and whether that could make them a target upon reentry to the US.\n\n\"We know that this administration is engaging in retaliatory actions against people who have engaged in constitutionally protected activism and speech,\" Altman said. \"And so I think people may want to think about their own history and imagine and explore if it might put them at high interest for retaliatory targeting and talk to an attorney about precautionary steps that can be taken before travel.\"\n\nIf you must travel, consider leaving your personal electronic devices at home. Border officials can ( and recently have ) requested access to immigrants' devices, including their cellphones.\n\nRefusing to grant them access might give them grounds to deny entry on the basis that they have insufficient information to determine if an immigrant is \"admissible\" to the US. But Campbell Walker said that she is concerned about officers lacking the training required to appropriately evaluate what's on a personal device.\n\nShe said that, based on reports from member attorneys of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, officials are now looking through social media feeds on people's phones for reasons to deny them admission to the US.\n\n\"I'm not asking anyone to lie. I'm not trying to obstruct justice,\" she said. \"But if somebody who may not have sufficient training is going to rip through a cellphone and jump to conclusions and potentially remove me or prevent me from entering the US, I don't think it's advisable to have a bunch of social media or photographs on the phone you travel with. I don't think it's very wise to be traveling with your [personal] laptop.\"\n\nYou've read 1 article in the last month\n\nHere at Vox, we're unwavering in our commitment to covering the issues that matter most to you - threats to democracy, immigration, reproductive rights, the environment, and the rising polarization across this country.\n\nOur mission is to provide clear, accessible journalism that empowers you to stay informed and engaged in shaping our world.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nWhat happens if the people caring for American children get deported?\n\nby Rachel Cohen\n\nThis story was originally published in The Highlight , Vox's member-exclusive magazine. To get early access to member-exclusive stories every month, join the Vox Membership program today .\n\nAmerica's fragile child care system relies heavily on immigrant workers. Donald Trump's immigration crackdown could cripple it.\n\nSince 2011, federal guidance has advised Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents against conducting enforcement in \"sensitive locations\" like hospitals, churches, schools and day care centers. On his first day back in office, Trump removed these longstanding protections , marking a major change from his first term as president. Now - with ICE officials charged with increasing their daily arrests from a few hundred people to upward of 1,500, and top immigration agents demoted for not deporting people fast enough - day care centers stand as direct targets.\n\nThe crackdown on immigrants threatens to upend an industry where foreign-born staff make up one-fifth of the workforce nationally - and nearly half in cities like New York, Los Angeles, and San Jose, California. Research led by the New American Economy think tank estimated that over 200,000 undocumented immigrants work in child care and day care services. The new, harsher enforcement comes at a particularly precarious time, as major employers phase out remote work policies , leaving parents with an intensifying scramble for child care.\n\nChild care programs already have an employee turnover rate 65 percent higher than average. The pay helps explain why: As of 2023, the median hourly wage for full-time, year-round child care workers was just $14.60, and the field ranked as the 10th lowest-paid occupation out of nearly 750 jobs across the economy, according to one analysis. The Trump crackdown could make everything even worse.\n\nJessica Brown, an economist at the University of South Carolina, has studied how earlier bouts of immigration enforcement affected child care markets. Her analysis of the Secure Communities program , which operated nationwide from 2008 to 2014, found that even when immigration enforcement primarily targeted men, it still disrupted female-dominated child care. The program decreased the overall supply of child care workers and centers and reduced enrollment overall.\n\nDespite claims that immigrants are taking jobs from native-born Americans, when immigrant workers left the child care industry, native-born workers didn't fill the gap. Instead, the number of native-born child care workers also decreased - as costs went up and centers closed.\n\nToday's situation could prove even more disruptive.\n\n\"The current raids represent a much more salient threat of deportation for women,\" said Brown, who anticipates a larger impact on child care markets compared to Secure Communities, at least in the short-term. \"The long-term effect depends on whether this becomes the new normal. More importantly, it's about perception - even if the raids decrease, once fear takes hold in immigrant communities, the chilling effects could linger.\" Among those most vulnerable to such fear are the children themselves.\n\nThese chilling effects aren't theoretical. The first Trump term provides insight into the impacts these raids could have on both kids and child care providers. Back in 2017, the Center for Law and Social Policy (CLASP), a national anti-poverty organization, launched a multistate study on how Trump's immigration policies were affecting children under age 8. In interviews with staff and families across six states, researchers found that children as young as three were showing signs of trauma from fears about enforcement.\n\nEarly childhood educators reported disturbing new behaviors - increased aggression, separation anxiety, and withdrawal - that they described as distinct from children's behaviors in past years. One preschool director in Georgia described a 5-year-old child whose anxiety was so severe that he was biting his fingertips until they bled.\n\nThe study found widespread drops in day care attendance and enrollment as families isolated themselves. Programs reported parents leaving young children with older siblings or grandparents instead of in formal care, minimizing time outside the home to avoid law enforcement encounters. With enrollment declines cutting into already-thin margins and state subsidies often tied to attendance, these shifts threatened the financial viability of centers that entire neighborhoods depend on.\n\nThe crisis extended beyond the direct provision of child care. Providers and parents reported increased reluctance to access public benefits like health insurance and nutrition assistance due to worries that Medicaid or SNAP information could be shared with immigration officials.\n\nEarly childhood staff themselves reported intense anxiety about increased incidents of racism and xenophobia affecting the families they serve and, in some cases, themselves personally. Many providers described the emotional burden of being asked by parents to become emergency guardians for their children in case they were deported.\n\nOne-third of young children in the US live with at least one parent who speaks a language other than English at home, and these children achieve better academic outcomes in dual-language child care programs - programs that often rely heavily on immigrant teachers.\n\nWendy Cervantes, the director of Immigration and Immigrant Families at CLASP who co-led the research, told Vox that the difficulty of finding child care providers who have the right skills to educate dual-language children is often overlooked. \"There are not a lot of people who have the training and are also bilingual who are competent,\" she said.\n\nDuring the first Trump administration, many child care providers didn't even know their centers were protected under the \"sensitive locations\" federal guidance, leading advocates to launch national campaigns to raise awareness about these safeguards. Now, however, those same advocates are working to help providers understand that guidance is no longer in effect, but that they still have constitutional rights.\n\n\"They still have rights under the Fourth Amendment to restrict the extent to which ICE can enter,\" Cervantes said. Immigration agents still need signed judicial warrants with a specific person's name and address to raid a private space. To help providers navigate these changes, CLASP is coordinating resources and planned a national webinar at the end of February for child care programs specifically.\n\nThe political crusade against immigration may score political points, but on the ground, it's setting up a chain reaction that could cascade through the entire economy.\n\nMany child care centers are also developing new protocols to operate in this environment. Some are removing outdoor signage to avoid ICE attention and developing new systems to communicate warnings to parents. Others are rethinking their data collection policies, to limit questions that ask about families' immigration status.\n\n\"There's a difference between finding out something and documenting,\" said Atenas Burrola Estrada, an attorney with the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights. She emphasized the importance of child care centers making plans ahead of time so that staff know what they need to do if ICE enforcement comes.\n\n\"What can be different about child care is the fear-factor, and it can be much more traumatizing for a small child,\" she said. \"Providers also need to know who to call if mom and dad don't come home, so they can avoid children ending up in state custody.\"\n\nSome states are hoping to create new protections through legislation. In California, a bill would make it harder for ICE agents to enter schools or child care centers. And even if agents met the requirements for entry, they'd still only be able to enter areas where children aren't present.\n\nIn Congress, Democrats Rep. Adriano Espaillat and Sen. Richard Blumenthal recently reintroduced a bill to codify the \"sensitive locations\" federal guidance. But the legislation is a long shot: It failed to pass in 2017, and today's political landscape has shifted so that even many Democrats now support tougher immigration enforcement amid growing concern about border security. Earlier this year, Congress passed the Laken Riley Act , requiring mandatory detention for immigrants accused of theft and related crimes - exactly the type of broad enforcement that advocates fear could sweep up child care workers.\n\nAs politicians wage war on immigration in the name of protecting American jobs, their policies threaten to unravel the very system that keeps millions of Americans - especially mothers - in the workforce. In classrooms across the country, children form bonds with care workers who help shape their earliest years, and immigrant teachers create the bilingual, multicultural spaces that define modern American childhood. The political crusade against immigration may score political points, but on the ground, it's setting up a chain reaction that could cascade through the entire economy - from parents forced to cut back work hours to businesses losing productive employees to a generation of children without supportive care at their most formative age.\n\nThis work was supported by a grant from the Bainum Family Foundation.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nInvestors in private prisons think they've hit the jackpot with a second Trump presidency.\n\nby Abdallah Fayyad\n\nDonald Trump rode his way to a comeback with a quintessential law-and-order campaign: He exaggerated crime trends, talked about American cities as though they were war zones , and directed his ire at migrants, flooding the Republican National Convention with \"Mass Deportation Now!\" signs.\n\nIt's hard to know exactly how Trump's harsh immigration policies will play out, but his campaign press secretary said that his new administration will start its mass deportation operation on day one.\n\nTrump won't take office until January, but if you're wondering whether he'll make good on his promise to arrest, detain, and deport migrants, here's one chart that paints a grim picture of what might be ahead:\n\nGEO Group, a private prison corporation that has had billions of dollars worth of contracts with the US Immigration Customs and Enforcement (ICE), saw a steep rise in its stock price on Wednesday - about 38 percent by the afternoon - after Trump was declared the winner of the presidential race. While that doesn't translate to policy, it does show that the markets are betting that the private prison industry will likely flourish under the next Trump administration.\n\nThis kind of market behavior is to be expected, since investors often overreact to news events. But even if today's movement is a temporary price spike, that doesn't change the fact that the company itself has been betting on a Trump presidency to make a fortune. GEO Group's spending on its lobbying efforts peaked during the Trump administration , and slowed down after President Joe Biden announced that he would phase out the Department of Justice's (DOJ) contracts with private prisons. The company had also donated to Trump's inauguration in 2017 and even hosted one of its annual events at one of his properties.\n\nThis time around, GEO Group's PAC maxed out on its contributions to Trump's campaign and gave a pro-Trump super PAC a $500,000 contribution.\n\nThe reason is obvious: The company views a second Trump term as a boon to its business, which relies on government contracts. And since Trump is planning a mass deportation campaign, that would likely mean the federal government will arrest and detain more migrants. In a recent earnings call with its investors, GEO Group executives suggested that if Trump won, his policies could bolster the amount of money being sent to its detention facilities that have contracts with ICE.\n\nWhile Trump liked to tout his bipartisan criminal justice reform bill , which was enacted in 2018, signs like today's market response to his victory show that private, for-profit prisons are expecting to see big returns when he returns to the White House. That's an alarming reality because conditions in private prisons, including ones run by GEO Group , tend to be worse than in federal facilities, as a 2016 DOJ report pointed out . The problem was so bad that in 2016, the Obama administration announced it would phase out contracts with private prisons after the DOJ determined that they were less safe for inmates than federally run facilities. (Trump swiftly reversed that policy .)\n\nThe markets don't always predict policy. But when it comes to where investors are putting their money and who private prison companies like GEO Group supported for president, the bet they are making is clear: A second Trump term is lucrative if you're in the business of incarcerating people. It's a pretty good bet.\n\nThe lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat - and a closer look at where they should go next.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nDemocrats' struggles to respond to Trump's immigration policies have some deeper, historical roots.\n\nby Christian Paz\n\nThe first few weeks of Donald Trump's second presidency have put Democrats in a frustrating bind.\n\nHe's thrown so much at them (and at the nation), that they're having serious trouble figuring out what to respond to - let alone how. He's signed dozens of executive orders; attempted serious power grabs and overhauls of the government; and signed controversial legislation. And in the process, he's further divided his opposition, as the Democrats undergo an identity crisis that ramped up after Kamala Harris's loss.\n\nImmigration policy is a prime example of this struggle: Long before Harris became their nominee, the party was debating just how much to adjust to both Trump's anti-immigrant campaign promises and to the American public's general shift away from openness to immigration. Now that he's in office, Democrats aren't really lined up to resist every one of the president's anti-immigrant moves - and some are even backing some of his stances.\n\nThe party is now divided into roughly three camps: those in the Senate and House willing to back Trump on certain tough-on-immigration measures, like the recently passed Laken Riley Act ; those who see their constituents supporting some of his positions but are torn over how to vote; and those progressives who are committed to resisting his every move on immigration.\n\nToday's public opinion is one main contributor for the divide: Americans are still largely in favor of more restrictionist immigration policy . Democratic losses in November are another contributor, particularly in areas with large immigrant or nonwhite populations.\n\nBut lawmakers are also confronting longer-standing historical dynamics that have divided the working class and immigrants before. Newer and undocumented immigrants can appear to pose both economic competition and threats to existing senses of identity for immigrants who have already resided in the US, or to those who have assimilated and raised new generations. Combined with a resurgent Republican Party that has capitalized on some of these feelings, these facts might be complicating the Democratic response to Trump now.\n\nOn the campaign trail last year, Trump and various other Republican politicians repeated a specific line of reasoning when making a pitch to nonwhite voters: The \"border invasion\" that Joe Biden and Harris were supposedly responsible for was \"crushing the jobs and wages\" of Black, Latino, and union workers. Trump called it \" economic warfare .\"\n\nThis line of reasoning - that immigrants are taking away economic opportunities from those already in the US - has historically been a source of tension for both native-born Americans, and older immigrants.\n\nMuch of the economics behind this has been challenged by economists , but the politics are still effective. The main claim here is that an influx in cheaper low-skilled laborers not only pushes down the cost of goods but negatively impacts preexisting American workers by lowering their wages as well. The evidence for this actually happening, however, is thin: Immigrants also create demand, by buying new items and using new services, therefore creating more jobs. Still, the idea remains popular.\n\nEven as far back as the civil rights era, this thinking created divisions among left-wing activist movements trying to secure better labor conditions and legal protections. Take the case of the most iconic figure of the Latino labor movement, César Chávez , himself of Mexican descent. As his movement to secure better conditions for farmworkers faced challenges from nonunion, immigrant workers who could help corporate bosses break or alleviate the pressures of labor strikes, his efforts on immigration took a more radical turn .\n\nChávez's United Farm Workers even launched an \"Illegals Campaign\" in the 1970s - an attempt to rally public opposition to immigration and get government officials to crack down on illegal crossings . The UFW even subsidized vigilante patrol efforts along the southern border to try to enforce immigration restrictions when they thought the government wasn't doing enough, and Chávez publicly accused the federal agency in charge of the border and immigration at the time of abdicating their duty to arrest undocumented immigrants who crossed the border.\n\nOf course, Chávez's views were nuanced - and primarily rooted in the goal of creating and strengthening a union that could represent and advocate for farmworkers and laborers left out of the labor movements earlier in the 19th and 20th centuries. But they are great examples of the deep roots that economic and identity status threats have in complicating the views of working-class and nonwhite people in the not-too-distant past.\n\nThis specific opinion has stuck around. Gallup polling since the early 1990s has found that for most of the last 30 years, Americans have tended to hold the opinion that immigration \"mostly hurts\" the economy by \"driving wages down for many Americans.\" And swings in immigration sentiment tend to align with how Americans feel about the state and health of the national economy: When economic opportunity feels scarce, as during the post-pandemic inflationary period, Americans tend to pull back from more generous feelings around both legal and illegal immigration.\n\nWhat makes this era of immigration politics perhaps a bit more complicated on top of those existing economic reasons is the added concerns over fairness and orderliness that many nonwhite Americans, and even immigrants from previous generations, feel.\n\nUS Rep. Juan Vargas, a progressive Democrat who represents San Diego and the part of California that borders Mexico, told me that there's a sense among some of his constituents that recent immigrants, both legal and not, are cutting the line. This feeling about newcomers not paying their dues is, again, a longstanding sentiment among immigrant groups across American history, but it appears updated for the post-pandemic era. While older immigrants feel they have worked hard and waited their turn, they feel newer ones have taken advantage of the asylum system, or gone through less of a struggle than they have.\n\nVargas told me about a conversation he had with a constituent in his district who told him she disagrees with his stance on immigration policy, even though she once \"came across illegally too\" and lived in the US for 15 years without documentation.\n\n\"I started talking to her, and she said, 'You know, these new immigrants, they get everything. They get here and they get everything. We didn't get anything, and so I think they should all be deported,'\" Vargas said. \"I said, 'Oh, so, because you were given a chance, you don't think other people should get that same chance?' She goes, 'Well, it's different.' ... Really, in what way? How is it different? ... And she didn't have a very good answer.\"\n\nSome immigration researchers describe this as part of a \"law-and-order\" mindset: folding border enforcement and immigration crackdowns with a renewed desire by the public for tough-on-crime policies in the post-pandemic era. Last year, the political scientist Matthew Wright described to me this segment of Americans, many of them nonwhite or descended from immigrants. They feel, he said, conflicting emotions about order at the southern border, disorder in how the government is managing it, and how their own communities could be put at risk for a breakdown in the system. They conflate feelings of insecurity and crime with the state of immigration, and come to believe that a broken system is benefitting some while allowing bad apples to slip between the cracks.\n\nThese views help explain why there's a vocal group of Democrats, including Latino Democrats, willing to work with Trump and Republicans specifically on immigration reforms that take a tough-on-crime approach, like the Laken Riley Act, which expedites deportation for undocumented immigrants charged with certain crimes.\n\nSome 46 House Democrats and 12 Senate Democrats ended up voting for the Laken Riley Act, including perhaps the most vocal pro-enforcement Latino Democrat, Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona. He argued that the bill represented where the Latino mainstream is now on immigration. \"People are worried about border security, but they also want some sane pathway to immigration reform. That's who I represent. I really represent the middle view of Arizona, which is largely working class and Latino,\" Gallego said after the vote.\n\nEven some Democrats in solid blue areas of the country agree, to an extent. Democratic Rep. Sylvester Turner, who represents Houston and was an outspoken supporter of immigrant rights during Trump's first presidency, told me that his constituents back tougher immigration policies, particularly when it comes to undocumented immigrants charged with violent crimes. He himself didn't vote for the Laken Riley Act because he disagreed with the bill's application to those merely charged or accused of a crime (as opposed to those convicted), but he said that he feels the public's mandate to support other kinds of proposals.\n\n\"People want the border secure,\" he told me. \"People don't want persons who have committed serious, violent crimes in this country. I'm not opposed to [Trump] securing the border, and I'm not opposed to him deporting individuals who have committed serious crimes.\"\n\nAll these divides in how Democrats are responding to Trump leave the party appearing less united than they might want to be, but it reflects where the public is. They're generally okay with bold statements about reducing both legal and illegal immigration , they want something done about the border, but they don't necessarily want Dreamers who were brought illegally to the US as children, or their undocumented neighbors deported.\n\nNone of the Democratic representatives I've spoken to since Trump's victory think the party should be abandoning the defense of immigration as value, but they understand they'll need to be strategic in what they respond to because their constituents are divided too.\n\nThey'll fight back against Trump when he tries to undue birthright citizenship, for example, but they won't necessarily criticize the continued construction of a border wall with Mexico, or increased deportations. They'll point out that deportation flights using military aircraft are mostly for show, while standard ICE-chartered planes can do the job for less. Many supported the bipartisan border bill that Biden tried to pass a little less than a year ago, for example, and would theoretically support it again.\n\nThey oppose the idea of \"mass deportations,\" but because they think the public actually wants more targeted deportations, and even poke fun at the inefficiency of some deportations under Trump's new guidelines, as Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy did recently.\n\nAnd they see room to defend DREAMers, DACA recipients, and those who have benefitted from asylum protections, like temporary protected status, because they see moral value in it, and political value as well: many of those categories of immigrants are popular with Republicans, and polling backs up these nuances.\n\n\"If you start talking about deporting the DREAMers in this country who have gone through our schools, graduated from our universities, and now can contribute back to this society, if you're talking about deporting them, that's going to be an issue,\" Turner said. \"There's going to be opposition if you talk about deporting children, or going into churches and schools and hospitals, and harassing our kids. But if you want to bring back the bill the Republicans and Democrats were prepared to sign last year, I think you will find support there.\"\n\nThese nuances over immigration policy specifically, therefore, encapsulate a bit of an overarching question Democrats are continuing to grapple with: how to resist and oppose a president who has some public support for policies they might not individually favor. So far, they're picking and choosing their battles. But public opinion won't stay static forever, and the opposition will have to evolve with it.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nIt's not good.\n\nby Nicole Narea\n\nIf all of President Donald Trump's Day 1 executive orders on immigration and deportation go through, he will have succeeded in a radical overhaul of US law. That, however, is a mighty \"if.\"\n\nHis agenda Monday was a mix of new and familiar policies: In the latter category, Trump revived a number of measures from his first administration, including forcing asylum seekers to wait in Mexico for decisions in the US immigration cases, implementing \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants coming into the US, and cracking down on \"sanctuary cities\" and states that refuse to cooperate with federal immigration agents.\n\nHe also began to implement several 2024 campaign promises, including establishing a framework through which he intends to carry out mass deportations, mobilizing the military to the border, and paring back Biden-era programs that gave temporary protections to hundreds of thousands of immigrants. And he delivered on a long-standing promise to sign an executive order potentially ending birthright citizenship - in the unlikely event it stands up to a court challenge.\n\nSome of these executive orders, such as the so-called Remain in Mexico policy , have already been tested in the courts during Trump's first administration or are clearly within his powers as president. That category includes rescinding his predecessor's executive orders or agency policy guidance on immigration, such as a Biden directive prioritizing violent criminals and recent arrivals for immigration enforcement. Other Trump actions appear patently illegal; the ACLU and 18 state attorneys general have already challenged his order ending birthright citizenship, which legal experts have long argued is blatantly unconstitutional .\n\nThe survival of other new policies, particularly around deportations, may depend on how they are implemented in practice. As new executive orders go into effect, legal advocates will be watching for the ways in which those policies could violate the constitutional rights of immigrants and existing federal immigration and national security laws.\n\nAccording to Doris Meissner, director of the Migration Policy Institute's immigration policy work, however, \"there is more sophistication, I think it's fair to say, in the way that they [Trump administration officials] are going about it,\" compared to the hasty executive orders of Trump's first term.\n\nIn short, we're in for months or even years of legal wrangling - and the outcomes of those fights will determine the reach of Trump's immigration overhaul.\n\nTrump made immigration a centerpiece of his 2024 campaign after record-high numbers of crossings at the US-Mexico border early in the Biden administration. While border crossings came down significantl y after former President Joe Biden implemented executive orders limiting access to asylum last year, Trump nevertheless signed Day 1 executive orders addressing what he described as an immigrant \"invasion\" and setting the stage for a large-scale deportation operation.\n\nTrump has sought to keep out and remove immigrants, both documented and undocumented, by multiple means:\n\nTrump's executive orders prioritize criminals (particularly members of drug cartels or international criminal gangs that he has now designated as foreign terrorist organizations) for deportation, but they make no promises to spare other undocumented immigrants. He is reportedly planning to order immigration raids in major cities in the early weeks of his new administration, though one such raid in Chicago may have been postponed following leaks.\n\nTo achieve his promised mass deportation agenda, Trump's executive orders look to beef up immigration detention capacity, seek cooperation with local law enforcement, expand the use of fast-tracked deportations, punish sanctuary cities and states, and sanction countries that have been reluctant to accept their own citizens as deportees.\n\nFinally and perhaps most controversially, he issued an executive order attempting to end birthright citizenship from February 19 onward, which would impact children born in the US to an undocumented mother or a mother in the US on a temporary visa, if their father also lacks citizenship or permanent residency status.\n\nDuring Trump's first term, the courts served as a check on his efforts to unilaterally remake the immigration system via executive order, regularly issuing nationwide blocks on his policies that often delayed if not ultimately doomed them.\n\nThis time, Trump's policies are just as likely to be challenged in court. A group of former Biden-Harris officials, in collaboration with the legal organization Democracy Forward, are gearing up to file lawsuits against Trump's initial executive orders . The ACLU and other legal organizations are also beginning to inundate the new Trump administration with litigation.\n\nHowever, what's different about Trump's second term is the makeup of the courts. Trump appointed swaths of conservative judges to the Supreme Court and other federal appellate courts during his first term, and he may now find a more favorable legal environment to enact his immigration policies.\n\nTrump officials appear to have learned from their mistakes, experts noted, and are less likely to rush to implement splashy policies - such as the travel ban on citizens of certain countries Trump pursued early in his first term - without gathering the necessary justification at the agency level.\n\n\"I think that the time that the Trump administration had to study some of their losses could have played into how they've framed these orders that just came out,\" said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank focused on immigration. \"They're trying to follow past decisions and put forward things that they think can stand up In the courts.\"\n\nAs president, Trump has significant discretion over federal immigration policy, and he already tested the limits of that authority during his first term. For instance, his \"Remain in Mexico\" policy, an amended version of his 2017 travel ban targeting Muslim-majority countries, and his efforts to expand \"expedited removal\" - a process by which immigrants can be deported quickly and without a hearing before an immigration judge - all survived legal scrutiny the first time around and likely will again.\n\nMany of Biden's immigration policies implemented via executive order can be - and indeed, already have been - undone via executive order. That includes Biden's implementation of immigration enforcement priorities and the CBP One app that allowed immigrants to sign up for appointments at the border where they were processed and often allowed to cross. On Monday, immigrants saw their appointments canceled .\n\nHowever, there are elements of Trump's executive orders that seem clearly illegal or at least deeply questionable, according to legal experts. That includes ending birthright citizenship, which most legal experts argue would require a constitutional amendment for which there does not exist sufficient support in Congress.\n\nIn another executive order, Trump also lays the groundwork to invoke the Alien Enemies Act , a 1798 law passed as part of the Alien and Sedition Acts that allows the president to detain and deport noncitizens from countries at war with the US. It was last used during World War II to detain civilians of Japanese, German, and Italian descent. Despite Trump's rhetoric about an invasion and his decision to name cartels and international criminal gangs as terrorist organizations, however, the US is not at war, and experts say Trump likely lacks legal standing to use the law to deport immigrants.\n\n\"Most experts believe that to invoke [the Alien Enemies Act] requires a declared war, and only Congress can declare war,\" said Muzaffar Chishti, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute and director of the think tank's office at New York University School of Law. \"Whether this is a war or there's an invasion is going to be subject to litigation, and there is good law against the President on this.\"\n\nSome of Trump's executive orders, however, may occupy a legal gray zone until we know more about exactly how they will be implemented or how they could infringe on individual rights. That includes his deployment of the military to the southern border.\n\nThere is a long precedent of the military supporting operations at the border through infrastructure and logistics, but not of US troops interacting directly with immigrants. An expanded presence on the border, particularly of active duty service members rather than National Guard troops, could violate federal law. That includes the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits the use of the military to enforce federal law without the permission of Congress or the Constitution.\n\nThese kinds of legal questions are likely to be resolved only after lengthy litigation, potentially delaying, if not sinking entirely, some key parts of Trump's immigration agenda. But the Trump administration also appeared on Monday more savvy about how it intends to defend the orders in court than it did in 2017 - and with a more pliant court system in place, it's an open question how far Trump's unilateral immigration agenda will go.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe Laken Riley Act passed with bipartisan support and will upend immigration enforcement.\n\nby Nicole Narea\n\nOne of the first bills that could be sent to President Donald Trump would vastly expand immigration detention and make it easier for states to influence immigration policy. It passed the Senate on Monday with the support of 12 Democrats and will now head to the House for final approval.\n\nThat bill, the Laken Riley Act, is named after a young woman who was killed last February by an undocumented immigrant from Venezuela. Her murderer was sentenced to life in prison.\n\nRiley has become a cause célèbre for Republicans, who argue that her death is the result of former President Joe Biden's immigration policies that allowed him to walk free despite a shoplifting charge. The House and Senate GOP lawmakers broadly back the bill, but it has received a mixed reception from Democrats. Some Democrats, reeling from major losses in 2024, Americans' frustration with the immigration status quo , and record-high border crossings under Biden, backed the bill, however.\n\nThe bill passed the House earlier this month with the support of 48 of the House of Representatives' 215 Democrats. After considering major amendments to the bill brought by Democrats, the Senate passed the bill with hardly any alternations. Two Democratic senators, Ruben Gallego of Arizona and John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, co-sponsored the Senate version.\n\nThe bill has two major parts:\n\nThe bill's proponents argue it will be a major step forward for public safety. But once signed by Trump, the bill could also strain existing immigration enforcement resources, infringe on immigrants' due process rights, and create a chaotic (and potentially unconstitutional) situation in which states are allowed to dictate federal immigration policy.\n\nRight now, federal law mandates that immigrants who have committed certain serious crimes, including murder, rape, domestic violence, and some drug offenses, be detained. But beyond those categories, federal immigration officials have discretion.\n\nIn 2021, the Biden administration issued policy guidance prioritizing people who were a national security threat, public safety threat, or \"border security threat\" (those who had recently entered the US without authorization). Otherwise, the Department of Homeland Security urged individual immigration officers to use their prosecutorial discretion - essentially, to leave everyone else alone.\n\nThe rationale was that immigration agencies have limited resources for enforcement, and Biden was aiming those resources as what he viewed as key threats among the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the US.\n\n\"The federal government will never have enough money or manpower to deport every undocumented noncitizen,\" said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration law professor at Cornell Law School. \"Courts are not equipped to delve into the details of who to prioritize for deportation.\"\n\nTrump already rescinded Biden's enforcement priorities in one of his first executive orders on Monday. The Laken Riley Act further upends enforcement, requiring that a much larger population of undocumented immigrants be detained.\n\nThe bill would require federal immigration authorities to detain undocumented immigrants accused of theft and other related crimes like shoplifting or burglary. Accusations triggering mandatory detention could be made in the US or another country. For example, if someone was charged with burglary in Venezuela and that came to the attention of US immigration officials, the accused burglar would have to be detained on that basis.\n\nThis would be a major expansion of immigration detention and deportation.\n\nUS Immigration and Customs Enforcement estimates that the bill would cost $83 billion over the next three years, enough to fund 118,500 additional detention beds, 40,000 more personnel, and a 25 percent increase in deportation flights. That updated estimate, reportedly circulated among Democratic leadership last week, is many times higher than ICE's previous $3.2 billion estimate .\n\nThese immigrants would be detained even if they weren't convicted and without the opportunity for a bond hearing. Currently, it's rare for anyone in the US accused of a crime to be detained without a bond hearing, even when the crime is as serious as murder. In immigrants' cases, mandatory immigration detention can actually impede their prosecution by making it logistically harder for them to show up for proceedings in their criminal cases .\n\nImmigrants, even those without documentation, have the same rights to due process as any other individual in the US, and immigrant advocates have argued this raises serious due process concerns: It increases the risk that an innocent person could be held on a prolonged basis with limited access to legal counsel that could help them win a case challenging their deportation.\n\n\"This potential provision could be unconstitutional given our Fifth Amendment right around liberty,\" Adriel Orozco, senior policy counsel at the American Immigration Council, a think tank focused on immigration policy said. \"Its ramifications are so far-reaching in the human context.\"\n\nThe other major prong of the bill would give states the automatic right to bring lawsuits challenging federal immigration policy on detention and visas, or decisions in individual immigration cases, if they can demonstrate they have experienced financial harm exceeding $100.\n\nThis is a mechanism that Republicans say is necessary to ensure the federal government is complying with its mandate to detain immigrants under the act. But in practice, it means courts would have to rule on the merits of states' claims rather than being able to dismiss them outright, and could potentially be inundated with such lawsuits.\n\n\"You could see any number of really hostile state officials filing lawsuits to change decisions that they don't like,\" Sarah Mehta, ACLU senior border policy counsel, said.\n\nThat could include, for example, challenging the issuance of visas to citizens of certain countries against which Republicans have taken a hardline stance, such as China, she said. That would have worrying implications not just for US immigration policy, but also lead to states dictating US foreign policy and having a major impact on the US relationship with both adversaries and allies. It could also make for open season on the decisions made by thousands of immigration line officers in the course of their day-to-day work.\n\nIt's possible that Democratic states could also try to use the bill to challenge federal immigration policy, perhaps to stem the tide of arrivals to blue cities - a phenomenon some state and local Democratic leaders have complained about - though it's not clear exactly on what basis they would do so.\n\nMehta said that the provision allowing for lawsuits is \"clearly constitutional overreach\" and courts might recognize it as such if the bill were to become law. She noted that the US Supreme Court already ruled in a 2023 case brought by Texas challenging the Biden administration's immigration enforcement priorities that such policies are under the exclusive purview of the federal government based on the Constitution, recognizing the need for a unified US response to immigration.\n\n\"States shouldn't be intervening in foreign policy or any of these immigration decisions because they don't have the expertise,\" Mehta said.\n\nIf the bill becomes law and survives legal scrutiny, the \"result is that courts would become the final arbiters of immigration policy,\" Yale-Loehr said.\n\nNow that the legislation has passed without amendments, it could sow chaos, inviting lawsuits challenging every new regulation or policy memo without addressing broader issues in the US's broken immigration system , which hasn't been meaningfully reformed since 1986.\n\nThose issues include an underresourced asylum system that isn't equipped to handle diverse populations; processing people at the border in a humane and orderly way, and expeditiously returning them to their home countries if they do not qualify for protections in the US; a lack of legal pathways to the US designed for current economic and humanitarian needs; millions of undocumented immigrants who have laid roots in the US yet have no way of achieving legal status; and factors pushing people out of their home countries that will continue to drive people to migrate.\n\nThe Laken Riley Act would leave all of that unresolved.\n\nUpdate, January 20, 7:50 pm ET: This story, originally published January 16, has been updated in light of the bill passing the Senate.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe nominee is pivoting hard to the right on immigration, so why do progressives say they can live with it?\n\nby Christian Paz\n\nSince Vice President Kamala Harris's ascension to the top of the Democratic ticket, a careful truce has settled in place between centrist, liberal, and progressive Democrats.\n\nNo loud or public spats among elected Democrats or Democratic voters over Harris's candidacy or campaign have made headlines, save for some premature skepticism by online progressives over Harris's vice presidential selection; Harris has nearly universal favorability among her fellow partisans. The Democratic National Convention (DNC) did not succumb to the kind of chaos and division that was anxiously predicted when Biden was the presumptive nominee; in fact, Democrats are showing heretofore unseen levels of being in array .\n\nPerhaps no issue is more emblematic of this party unity than the thorny topic Democrats have long hoped to avoid: the politics of immigration and the southern border. At the DNC last week, Harris and the speakers who addressed the nation made clear that the Democratic Party of 2024 is moving right , toward the political center, when it comes to how they talk about immigrants, migration, and security at the southern border. While humanitarianism, openness to migrants, and rolling back restrictive Trump-era policies used to be the Democratic focus, Democrats are locked in on stopping the flow of migrants, limiting asylum, and funding more Border Patrol operations.\n\nThat's partially out of a need to appeal to moderate, swing, and independent voters in the various battleground states that will decide the 2024 election. But it's also a recognition of the very different national environment Democrats are operating in. American adults of all stripes have turned much more negative in their thinking about immigration and border security. The days of talking up a humanitarian approach to immigration, of expanding opportunities for asylum seekers, and racing to outflank other Democrats from the left, are gone.\n\nPresidential candidates pivoting to the middle on key issues ahead of a general election is unsurprising. What is surprising is that, on immigration, the Harris campaign is doing so without facing much opposition from liberal politicians, progressive activists, or even longtime pro-immigrant advocacy groups. Progressive activists and advocates say that truce will likely hold - at least until after Trump is defeated and a more receptive President Kamala Harris is elected.\n\n\"Yes, there is a palpable and deep worry about how much Democrats are willing to compromise on immigration,\" Vanessa Cárdenas, the executive director of the pro-immigration reform group America's Voice, told me. \"We're in a very different political moment than years past. We're going to have to make hard choices. But ultimately as advocates, we need to keep our eye on the ball and make sure we win as much as possible.\"\n\nHarris previewed her new vision, and the Democratic Party's new direction, during her acceptance speech last Thursday when she promised to \"bring back the bipartisan border security bill that [Donald Trump] killed.\"\n\nThat bill, negotiated earlier this year by Biden and a bipartisan group of senators, would have put $20 billion toward new security measures at the southern border and imposed new, more restrictionist policies toward asylum seekers and other migrants. The bill failed once Trump began to voice his opposition, on the grounds that it could defuse an issue that, left unaddressed, could benefit him in the election, but its mere existence was remarkable for the absence of a pathway to citizenship or other pro-immigrant priorities Democrats have traditionally advocated for.\n\nHarris's embrace of the bill is a major signal for how her administration would deal with immigration: She's just fine with border policy that is tough on migrants and strengthens border security without offering much to pro-immigrant groups.\n\nBut her support for the measure has received scrutiny from Trump's campaign and some in the press, who note that the bill included hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for southern border wall construction , something Harris previously criticized and called \"un-American.\" The VP's campaign argues that the money was just a continuation of spending authorized during the Trump presidency, updated with new guidelines on where it can be spent.\n\nAnd she's not making a full break with Democratic tradition.\n\n\"I know we can live up to our proud heritage as a nation of immigrants and reform our broken immigration system,\" she also said to thunderous applause in her DNC speech. \"We can create an earned pathway to citizenship - and secure our border.\"\n\nPro-immigrant activists described the position Harris articulated in her DNC speech to me as a \"both/and\" approach to immigration: reforming a broken system for processing asylum claims, providing a pathway to citizenship for those undocumented immigrants living in the US for a substantial period of time, and restoring order at the southern border without demonizing immigrants.\n\nIt's a palatable balance for now but one that may not be sustainable in the longer term given some of the harder-line stances, including embracing the bipartisan border bill, that Harris, Biden, and the rest of the party have taken. The 2024 DNC platform, for example, acknowledges that part of the reason immigration reform is critical is to speed up the deportation of economic migrants and those deemed not to have a legal reason for immigrating. It also calls for Congress to \"strengthen requirements for valid asylum claims\" and boosts Biden's executive actions to limit asylum when border crossings reach an untenable level.\n\nFor some progressives, the party's embrace of the border bill is worrying because the negotiation process that produced it in early 2024 marked a significant departure from the way Democrats have traditionally dealt with immigration and border politics.\n\nFor most of the last decade and a half, Democratic politicians would generally only consider enforcement and border security funding when paired with pro-immigrant reforms or policies. Biden's deal with Senate Republicans didn't address the human side of the immigration debate and instead dealt only with border security.\n\n\"Some of the lessons learned in the past are that sometimes Democrats give in so much to enforcement, and it's not congruent with what is obtained on the legalization side,\" Cárdenas said. \"We are concerned about the often-cited Senate bill - we're concerned that that might be the starting point of any legislation.\"\n\nBut elections are binary choices, Cárdenas and other advocates point out. Right now, Harris is triangulating a position that responds to real-world factors: the images of people crossing the border, the overwhelmed border communities dealing with constant flux, Republicans politicizing the issue and demonizing migrants, and public opinion turning away from the pro-immigrant movement.\n\nThe RNC and DNC offered \"a very clear difference on how both parties and candidates are speaking about immigration,\" Yadira Sanchez, the executive director of the progressive organizing group Poder Latinx, told me. One convention was a rally in favor of mass deportations and used \"the border and immigrants themselves as scapegoats to spread hate and xenophobia around the border crisis,\" Sanchez said. The other convention presented their candidate as the daughter of immigrants, who honors the country's immigrant past while wanting to crack down on transnational gangs.\n\nSanchez also pointed out the Democrats' pivot to the center in speeches and the party platform, but she noted that the alternative to Democratic governance would be untenable for immigration advocates and immigrants alike.\n\n\"Yes, we didn't get everything that we wanted as an immigrant rights organization. We want to have fair, equitable, dignified, humane asylum processes for folks that are seeking that refuge, that are experiencing that turmoil in their countries, that are looking for safety. The border talk was something where we saw the shift, but I wouldn't say it completely complicates our advocacy work because our advocacy work goes beyond any candidate, in the sense that we will hold them accountable,\" Sanchez said.\n\nThe overriding sense I picked up from these activists is that they and their constituencies understand the trade-off in front of them: To accomplish their policy goals, they need a Democratic president and Democratic congressional majorities, so they'll remain part of the big-tent coalition that Harris and the party are trying to build in order to win in November. It mirrors what moderate candidates like New York Rep. Tom Suozzi did to respond to suburban concerns about immigration, and what even some progressive candidates, like Michelle Vallejo in the Rio Grande Valley, are doing now : recognizing that electoral victories are the top priority and pivoting to tougher talk on the border in the hope of winning congressional majorities.\n\nThat doesn't mean progressives don't have some strong disagreements with the approach Harris and the Democratic Party are currently taking, but they'll likely avoid direct confrontation.\n\n\"Right now, the assignment is very clear,\" Cárdenas said. \"We have to make sure that Trump is defeated, and in February 2025, we can have a conversation about what kind of reforms we need to make.\"\n\nThe lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat - and a closer look at where they should go next. From senior correspondent Eric Levitz.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nBiden knew the border situation meant political disaster. But he struggled for years to address it. Why?\n\nby Andrew Prokop\n\nOne of the main reasons Vice President Kamala Harris lost the election is the Biden administration's record on immigration and the border - polls show it ranks up close with inflation among the top issues that drove swing voters to Trump.\n\nAnd the recriminations about how Democrats got so out of step with the public on this issue are well underway. Part of the story, as The Atlantic's Rogé Karma and others have written, involves a badly wrong electoral theory that held that support of unauthorized immigrants was key to winning over Latino voters. And part of it is the increased influence of progressive advocacy groups who pushed the party left .\n\nBut the true heart of Democrats' political disaster on immigration is a policy failure from top Biden officials.\n\nThese officials - including the president - understood perfectly well that a border surge was politically perilous. They sought to drive down arrivals, starting early in Biden's first year in office: All the way back in March 2021, the New York Times reported , Biden was furious about the border crisis, demanding to know whom he needed to fire to fix it.\n\nThe problem was that, for three full years, Biden's team proved unable to fix it.\n\nUntil, in 2024, they suddenly did.\n\nDuring Biden's first three years in office, the number of arriving migrants skyrocketed , leading to a backlash as even blue states and cities complained they were overwhelmed. The peak came in December 2023, a month when officials reported about 250,000 encounters with migrants at the border, a record.\n\nThen, starting early in 2024, and continuing throughout the year, border arrivals plummeted. In August, border encounters had dropped to about 58,000 - 77 percent lower than the previous December's level. By the end of the year, they'd dropped even further .\n\nSome Democrats touted this as a policy success for Biden - he himself bragged about it at his debate with Trump. But the timeline raises some questions.\n\nFor instance: If it was possible all along to get the border much more under control, why didn't Biden do it years ago? If this was what Biden hoped to achieve all along, what went wrong in the administration's decision-making that it only materialized after years of political pain?\n\nThe answers are central to reckoning with Biden's border record, and with how Democrats should handle the issue in the future.\n\nTypically, retrospectives like these begin chronologically, at the start of the administration. But in this case, it's more helpful to start near the end - with the question of why border arrivals actually did plummet in 2024.\n\nProgressives have often tended to argue that surges in unauthorized immigration are fundamentally outside the president's control - that, overall, migration trends are driven by broader structural factors , like poor governance and economic conditions in the migrants' home country, and the relative strength of the US economy.\n\nYet the Latin American countries from which people have been fleeing did not suddenly grow far more stable in 2024, and economic conditions in the US were pretty similar to 2023. So this doesn't satisfactorily explain the dramatic change in the past year.\n\nRather, there were two important policy changes that occurred that year: one south of the border, and one north of it.\n\nFirst, the Biden administration got the Mexican government to launch an extensive crackdown .\n\nIn the months after December 2023, when Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas traveled to Mexico for talks with government officials, Mexican enforcement officials suddenly started doing far more to stop people from getting to the US border in the first place - apprehending more migrants and sending them to the south of Mexico.\n\nBorder arrests then plummeted in the first few months of 2024.\n\nSecond, in June, Biden announced an executive action that, as my colleague Nicole Narea wrote , was \"arguably the most restrictive measure Biden has taken yet on the US-Mexico border.\" He decreed that new unauthorized migrants would be ineligible for asylum if too many people were coming to the border, which critics said amounted to shutting down the asylum process.\n\nBoth of these brought criticism from progressive advocates for being cruel policies reminiscent of Trump. Skeptics have also questioned whether they will work in the long term if demand to enter the US remains so high. Yet for the time being, at least, they appear to have succeeded in Biden's long-held goal of cutting down on chaos at the border. The problem is that this only happened long after the political damage to Democrats had been done.\n\nThe Biden administration only ended up arriving at this policy mix after a long and winding road on which they tried many other approaches - approaches that, one after another, failed.\n\nAll this time, Biden's own instincts counseled political peril, and he frequently berated his staff for failing to solve the border problem. But he was also cautious about policies that could be tagged as too Trumpian. This caution was in part due to fear of alienating progressives. Biden's 2021 border policies - which were far less restrictionist than those he eventually embraced - were already enough to spur progressive backlash.\n\nMeanwhile, the administration was riven by internal tensions, which constantly spilled out in the press. One aide close to the progressive advocacy world stepped down in late 2021 and went public with her critiques in a New Yorker article headlined \"The disillusionment of a young Biden official.\" When Domestic Policy Council chair Susan Rice pushed tougher policies, more left-leaning appointees complained to sympathetic reporters that she was cruel and heartless .\n\nSo each climb up one more rung of this restrictionist ladder was only taken after prolonged contemplation and with great reluctance. Each time, the political pain the administration was feeling from the right and the center-left - including blue state Democrats dealing with migrant surges - became intense enough to spur them to disregard a bit more of the left's concerns.\n\nStill, the administration kept hoping there was some sweet spot that would solve the border problem while also delivering pro-immigration groups a win - and they never found it.\n\nBut crackdowns at home weren't the only reason border arrivals plummeted in 2024 - indeed, there's a good case they weren't even the main reason. That main reason, many analysts believe , was the aforementioned stepped-up enforcement from Mexico that Biden officials had secured in a late 2023 understanding. That is: it was diplomacy that did the trick.\n\nWhich makes sense - if the policy goal is to reduce border arrivals, preventing people from getting to the border is an obvious way to do that. But progressive advocates had long condemned this reasoning as immoral and cruel to migrants who were leaving awful conditions in their countries of origin to seek a better life in the US. This would only be a band-aid on the problem, they claimed; only solving the root causes of emigration would fix the problem.\n\nThe problem is that the root causes are extremely hard to solve - making troubled countries more politically stable, economically prosperous, and safe is easier said than done. The main countries at issue didn't even stay the same - an initial focus on El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras was soon swamped by increased migration from Venezuela, Cuba , Nicaragua , and Haiti . There was, arguably, simply no way to solve any of those countries' issues anytime soon.\n\nThat left the option of Mexico, through which all those migrants heading to the US's southern border pass. Trump's greatest successes at reducing border numbers had seemed to come through getting the Mexican government to do the enforcement for him. To achieve that, Trump had come to an understanding with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) that, so long as border arrivals dropped, he wouldn't interfere in Mexico's domestic affairs - a status quo AMLO seemed to like .\n\nYet Biden's team came into power with other priorities for the relationship as well - such as criticizing AMLO or his allies for offenses against Mexico's democratic system and journalists , as well as defending the interests of US energy companies. Relations started off hostile and remained rocky for some time . Eventually, the administration concluded - correctly - that there was much more the Mexican government could be doing to deter arrivals and wasn't, which led to the December 2023 talks that preceded Mexico's enforcement crackdown .\n\nBut why not earlier? The exact reasons this took so long to produce - how much was due to a reluctance to follow in Trump's footsteps, a lack of prioritization, poor negotiation, AMLO's truculence, or other matters - remain unclear. But it certainly seems with hindsight that, if Biden's administration understood the full extent of the political danger of the border issue, they would have prioritized it more and earlier in their relations with Mexico.\n\nNow, with Trump set to take office and impose his mass deportation agenda , Democrats are running scared on immigration. Dozens of House Democrats voted to support the Laken Riley Act , a sweeping bill mandating detention of unauthorized immigrants accused of certain crimes. It is currently before the Senate, and several Democrats seem inclined to support it there too.\n\nRather than simply moving reflexively right, the party should thoughtfully recalibrate, to determine what approach can best let them stand up for moral and ethical policies while being politically sustainable.\n\nIndeed, prominent figures in the immigration advocacy world are now arguing that Democrats went too far left, and need to rebrand themselves as the party that can establish order at the border - that only then will they have the credibility to keep defending unauthorized immigrant families here now.\n\nBiden came to a similar realization eventually. \"We must face the simple truth,\" Biden said in remarks at the White House this past June, when announcing his new asylum restrictions. \"To protect America as a land that welcomes immigrants, you must first secure the border and secure it now.\"\n\nThat was a view Democrats generally shared at the start of Barack Obama's presidency. Obama initially prioritized border enforcement, believing only that could win public - and Republican - support for a deal legalizing the status of unauthorized immigrants here now. But the deal never materialized, and Democrats responded by moving to the left. They increasingly prioritized helping unauthorized immigrants, rather than cracking down on them, a cause that seemed to gain more steam when Trump was in power.\n\nBut by the time Biden took office, the party had turned away from the \"border security first\" approach. Instead, border security was just one of many immigration-related priorities. Though Biden's team genuinely hoped to send arrival numbers down, for three years they were either unable to figure out what it took, or unwilling to do what it took, to make that happen.\n\nThough Biden's team feared public backlash, they implicitly hoped that the public had evolved - that the backlash against Trump meant the country could accept far higher levels of unauthorized immigration. That many Americans really now believed that in this house, no human is illegal.\n\nThey have since been disabused of that notion.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThey include harsh new proposals, and augmented versions of past ideas, too.\n\nby Li Zhou\n\nIf you're looking for a window into just how extreme another Donald Trump term could be - even compared to his first - the immigration policies he's touted provide a clear preview.\n\nAlong with reupping his old ideas, Trump has spoken at length about how he intends to scale up his past policies, calling for the \" largest domestic deportation operation in American history .\" He's focused, too, on bringing back wide-ranging raids to round up undocumented immigrants and setting up new camps where they'd be forcibly detained . And he's interested in testing out proposals he didn't get to last term, such as severely limiting birthright citizenship .\n\nEssentially, Trump's second-term immigration policy is shaping up to be much like his first, but even harsher.\n\nTake Trump's proposal for a new travel ban , a policy imposed during his first term: \"When I return to office, [it's] coming back even bigger than before and much stronger than before,\" Trump said in a July 2023 speech .\n\nThat 2016 ban temporarily barred travelers from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the US before it was struck down by the courts (only to return in updated form ). On his first day in office, President Joe Biden rescinded the ban . This time around, Trump is weighing expanding this ban to encompass people from even more places, including Afghanistan and Gaza , and to bar those who express \"communist\" and \"Marxist\" views .\n\nMuch of what's driving Trump's hardline immigration policies is how they resonate with Republican base voters , including those who subscribe to xenophobic ideas of keeping migrants out and economic claims about immigrants purportedly taking jobs or abusing benefits. Additionally, a recent surge in migrant apprehensions across the southern border, as well as an influx of migrants in major cities across the country, has put the issue more prominently in the news, and provided a platform for Republicans - Trump included - to argue the current administration doesn't have immigration under control.\n\nTwo developments could make Trump's immigration policy in 2025 more viable than it was in his first term as well. Trump is reportedly planning to staff his next administration with loyalists who will find a way to execute his vision, unlike some of the staffers who've tried to restrain him in the past. And changes to the judiciary because of Trump's appointments - including the stacking of the Supreme Court with his nominees - could mean a better legal reception for his policies. Biden has also added a high number of justices to the federal judiciary, but Trump's nominees to the Supreme Court as well as powerful appeals panels like the Fifth Circuit have skewed key parts of the judiciary for the foreseeable future.\n\n\"2025 won't feel like 2017,\" Todd Schulte, the president of FWD.us, an immigration rights advocacy group that has fought Trump's policies, told Vox. \"2025 will feel radically different. And [people] should expect that when Donald Trump comes into office, families will be torn apart at the border and families will be torn apart in the United States.\"\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment about his plans. His advisers have made his ambitions clear, however. As Stephen Miller, one of Trump's chief immigration advisers, put it in an interview with the New York Times : \"Trump will unleash the vast arsenal of federal powers to implement the most spectacular migration crackdown.\"\n\nTrump and his advisers misleadingly claim that bringing back and augmenting past policies is necessary because a recent wave of immigrants is capitalizing on public services and allegedly sowing crime and disorder in different states and cities. Using rhetoric that echoes Nazis and authoritarians, Trump has made incendiary and racist statements about how immigrants are \" poisoning the blood of our country \" and coming to the US from \" mental institutions ,\" all of which are discriminatory and unfounded.\n\nDespite this, his calls for harsher policies have taken on a new tenor as places like New York City and Chicago have grappled with an influx of migrants in the last year, and as local leaders have called for more federal funding to assist them in providing resources like shelter.\n\nSummarizing the GOP's position in a statement to Vox, Lora Ries , the director of the Heritage Foundation's Border Security and Immigration Center, argued: \"The Biden Administration has erased our borders and the line between illegal and legal immigration.\"\n\nImplicit in this stance is that Trump's policies would expand immigration restrictions and take on the issue in an even more punitive way. Below are some of the proposals that Trump's team has laid out - and how they would work:\n\nMass deportations: A centerpiece of Trump's immigration proposals is heavily inspired by a 1954 policy implemented by former President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who deported hundreds of thousands of undocumented Mexican workers during his administration.\n\nAs part of a program called \"Operation Wetback,\" which referenced a racist slur used to describe Mexican migrants, border control agents identified and detained undocumented people and forced them onto planes and trains to Mexico.\n\nTrump has said he hopes to institute something similar, with the goal of completing annual deportations that number in the millions. That figure would be much higher than the number of deportations any recent administration - including Trump's - has conducted.\n\nAs part of this effort, Trump's team has said they'd like to capitalize on a policy known as \"expedited removal,\" which allows the government to rapidly remove undocumented people without a hearing.\n\nUnder most administrations (including the current one), this policy was only applied to people who had been in the US for 14 days or less, and who were within a 100-mile radius of the US border. In his first term, however, Trump expanded it - using it to deport anyone who couldn't prove that they'd been in the US for more than two years.\n\nImmigration experts have argued policies like this would amount to a nationwide \"show me your papers\" rule, and, as was the case with Eisenhower's program, could also result in citizens and legal residents being mistakenly deported.\n\nRaids: Miller tells the Times that there will be renewed attempts to conduct broad raids to detain undocumented immigrants that don't focus on any specific individual, but that include large sweeps of workplaces and other public areas. Additionally, Trump's campaign has said that he'll seek to \"deputize the National Guard and local law enforcement \" to assist with these removals in jurisdictions that are open to supporting the effort.\n\nWorkplace raids were a feature of Trump's first term, but they've since been ended by Biden .\n\nUnder Trump, the US saw the largest workplace raids in a decade, during which immigration officials targeted seven Mississippi poultry plants and apprehended 680 people. Trump's raids also differed from those under his predecessor, because Obama's immigration enforcement tended to prioritize people who were threats to national security , people with criminal convictions, and people who had been in the US for shorter amounts of time.\n\nObama was still nicknamed the \"deporter-in-chief,\" however, for how expansive his policies were. In comparison, Trump's targeting was even more indiscriminate.\n\nAny new raids are set to both build on the scope of past ones - and continue to expand their reach. Such policies have been criticized by immigration advocates, who note that these raids are traumatic and stressful, and that they often violate people's due process rights .\n\nDetention camps: Trump has expressed an interest in opening up detention camps where the US government can hold undocumented immigrants - both those apprehended at the border and inside the country - while their cases are being processed.\n\nPresently, undocumented people don't typically have to wait in a detention center while they await their trial, a period that could last months to years given how severe the immigration case backlog is. Trump would attempt to make detention a requirement while these cases are being considered.\n\nThe US doesn't currently have sufficient space and facilities, let alone funding, to house the number of people who would be detained under Trump's policy. To solve this problem, federal officials would build new camps, resembling existing ICE detention facilities , according to Miller.\n\nLittle is known about what such camps would ultimately include, but one possible example is a tent city that the Trump administration built for unaccompanied migrant children in Tornillo, Texas . That tent city - which was eventually shuttered - housed 2,000 minors and was criticized for failing to provide sufficient health care access.\n\nUCLA immigration law professor Hiroshi Motomura noted that efforts to establish these camps would probably face legal challenges as well as potential public outcry. Such camps would infringe on immigrants' civil rights and likely subject them to harsh living conditions.\n\n\"It's going to remind people of Japanese American incarceration,\" Motomura told Vox. \"I think a big part of the American public would recoil at some of these things if they're actually out there.\"\n\nSuspending refugee resettlement: Trump sharply cut the cap on refugees during his first term and he's committed to suspending refugee resettlement if he retakes office.\n\nThat would mean another sharp drop in the number of refugees that the US takes in even as the number of displaced people around the world has grown.\n\nThe US has long been known as one of the most welcoming countries to refugees in the entire world, though the number of people who were accepted in Trump's first term dropped 80 percent compared to that of his predecessor, undermining that perception.\n\nBiden has increased the refugee cap to 125,000 people per year, a major uptick from the 15,000 people per year Trump had reduced it to in 2021. The Biden administration has also admitted tens of thousands of Ukrainian and Afghan refugees outside of this cap, and it's unlikely Trump would continue these programs.\n\nSuch changes would leave tens of thousands of refugees fleeing war and poverty with limited recourse - and places to go.\n\nEnding Temporary Protected Status programs : Under a program known as Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, people fleeing hardships in their country of origin are able to live and work in the US temporarily. (TPS, unlike refugee status, does not guarantee a legal pathway to citizenship, though it can be renewed.)\n\nThe Biden administration has extended the number of people who qualify for TPS, adding 400,000 Venezuelan migrants to the program.\n\nEliminating TPS is an effort Trump would resurrect, and that would likely go to the courts again. Were the administration actually successful in doing away with TPS, hundreds of thousands of people who've lived in the US for years could be forced to leave.\n\nMaking seeking asylum harder: Trump also intends to revive the \"Remain in Mexico\" policy, which requires people seeking asylum at the southern border to wait in Mexico while their claims are being processed. After the Supreme Court ruled that the Biden administration had the right to dismantle this program, it was shut down in 2022.\n\nAdditionally, Trump hopes to use the Title 42 policy - which allows presidents to temporarily throttle migration during public health emergencies - once more to bar migrants from entering the US on the grounds that they would be bringing in contagious illnesses. (That premise has previously been deemed false and refuted by public health experts .)\n\nImmigration advocates have raised concerns that both programs increase the dangers migrants face after they've been expelled or while waiting in Mexico, including exposure to kidnapping and trafficking .\n\nEnding DACA: Trump has made clear that he will again try to impose policies that the courts once opposed, including ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which shields about 580,000 undocumented people who came to the US as children, from deportation.\n\nIn June 2020 , the Supreme Court rejected the Trump administration's attempts to sunset the program, which has faced additional court challenges since. Those challenges have led judges to bar new applicants from the program while allowing current recipients to continue receiving benefits.\n\nIf Trump were to successfully end DACA, it could be devastating for the thousands of people it covers and put them in a new state of legal limbo.\n\nReviving family separation hasn't been ruled out: Trump has declined to rule out a potential resumption of family separations, a hardline \"zero-tolerance\" policy that was extremely controversial in his first term .\n\nUnder that policy, parents seeking asylum at the southern border were separated from their children and detained in separate facilities as they awaited legal proceedings. Thousands of children and parents were separated in this way, prompting widespread backlash and Trump to end the practice in 2018.\n\nIn 2021, the Biden administration officially rescinded the \"zero-tolerance\" policy that undergirded family separations. Were Trump to revive it, the effects could be traumatic and devastating for migrant families seeking asylum in the US.\n\nAttacks on birthright citizenship: Currently, birthright citizenship is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution.\n\nTrump has said he'd announce a new executive order that bars the children of undocumented immigrants born in the US from obtaining birthright citizenship. This policy would almost certainly be immediately contested in court, and would probably be among the most difficult of Trump's proposals to implement.\n\nHe's said he wants to go after birthright citizenship because that would reduce the motivation for undocumented migrants to enter the US. According to the Migration Policy Institute, an immigration think tank that backs liberal proposals, this policy could increase the population of undocumented people by 4.7 million by 2050 given the number of children who have two unauthorized parents in the US.\n\nAdditionally, a move like this would undercut a longstanding tenet of the US immigration system, and the broader message it sends about who belongs in the US and who qualifies as a citizen.\n\nKey differences could make a second Trump administration more effective at instituting these policies, too.\n\nDuring his first administration, Trump was able to nominate three Supreme Court justices, tilting the court 6-3 in favor of conservative justices. He added a staggering number of judges to circuit courts and lower courts as well.\n\nAdditionally, the Supreme Court's 2022 Aleman Gonzalez decision determined that lower courts couldn't block certain national immigration policies from going into effect and that only the Supreme Court could do so. This means many major policy changes Trump could attempt would likely be decided by the Supreme Court - which, again, has an ideological bent in his favor.\n\nAs the Times reported , Trump is also intent on bringing on staffers and advisers who support his aims, unlike some who previously tried to curb him. There are also legal takeaways from his first term that Trump staffers would be able to apply if they try to resurrect contentious past proposals.\n\n\"Having attorneys who back his positions and who, through the course of his first term, developed the experience needed to write regulations that could withstand challenges in court - those would be important developments in terms of how effective he could be,\" says Kathleen Bush-Joseph , a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute.\n\nThese factors could mean that Trump's immigration policy might succeed where he once failed. They could suggest, too, that he's able to build on what he achieved in his first term and magnify its impact even more.\n\n\"The tools that the president would have, were he to come back, to accomplish terrible aims are much, much, much worse and larger in 2025, than they were in 2017,\" says Schulte.\n\nThe lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat - and a closer look at where they should go next.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nTrump-style immigration restrictions have gone mainstream among 2024 voters.\n\nby Nicole Narea\n\nImmigration has loomed large over the presidential election.\n\nAfter going on the offensive against former President Donald Trump's immigration policies in 2020, the Democratic Party has seen public opinion shift in recent years, with more people taking a dim view of immigration and favoring more restrictive border policies.\n\nTrump has pounced on this shift, promising to revive - and expand - the draconian immigration platform of his first administration. That includes his 2024 pledges of mass deportations and ending birthright citizenship . He has blamed Harris for the surge in migrants arriving at the border for much of her vice presidency, mislabeling her as President Joe Biden's \" border czar ,\" as many others also have .\n\nThe question of what to do about immigration animates voters across the political spectrum. It's an especially potent topic for Republicans, 48 percent of whom say it's the most important issue facing the country in a running Gallup poll.\n\nIt's less so for independents and Democrats, but notably, it's the first time in more than a decade that such a large share of independents say it's their top issue. And independents will likely decide the election: The US has seen its share of independent voters swell in recent years, particularly in Sunbelt swing states like Arizona and Nevada that have seen high levels of immigration .\n\nOverall, an overwhelming majority of registered voters said in a June Gallup poll that they will only vote for a candidate who shares their views on immigration, or that it is one of many important factors determining who they support.\n\nMore voters of all stripes now want to see immigration levels decrease than at any point since the early 2000s, after the 9/11 terrorist attacks fueled a rise in nativism . This is in part a reaction to record levels of migrant crossings over the past few years - unauthorized migrant crossings hit a record high in December - and the resulting pressures in cities and border communities that have absorbed them. (However, it is worth noting that border crossings have declined for five straight months .)\n\nIn response to record crossings, the Biden administration shifted from its previous focus on implementing a more humane US immigration system to limiting the flow of people across the US-Mexico border. Biden has pursued some policies to curb asylum that put little daylight between him and Trump, and has credited those policies for the recent decline in crossings .\n\nSimultaneously, Biden has advanced efforts to protect undocumented immigrants living in the US. Now, Democrats' 2024 platform emphasizes border security and deterring unauthorized immigration while expanding legal pathways to the US.\n\nLarger shifts in immigration have little to do with Biden's policies. Rather, migration patterns have significantly shifted in only a few years, and the US immigration system just wasn't designed to deal with it.\n\nHistorically, migrants came alone seeking work, mainly from Mexico. Now, more people are coming from South America, the Caribbean, and even China and Europe. They're increasingly bringing their families and seeking asylum. Many of them are fleeing persecution or instability in their home countries.\n\nBut regardless of what voters think is behind the surge, it's clear American public opinion on immigration has taken a sharp rightward turn in the last four years, and that a bipartisan consensus has emerged in Washington around further restricting immigration. The polling suggests that's broadly what most voters want, too - but how exactly they think the US should go about it isn't as clear-cut.\n\nSome proposals for immigration enforcement that were controversial just a few years ago now have mainstream appeal.\n\nThat includes Trump's efforts to build a border wall, a defining policy of his 2016 campaign. While in office, he erected about 500 miles of a 30-foot border fence , most of which replaced preexisting fencing or provided another layer of barrier where some already existed.\n\nAt that time, support for the project hovered around a third of Americans . But that share has since seemed to balloon. Multiple polls conducted in recent months have shown that a majority of Americans want a wall, and that support has grown substantially among independents. In a separate April Axios-Ipsos poll, 42 percent of Latinos , despite many of them having ties to the immigrant experience, supported building the wall.\n\nVoters don't even draw the line at the kind of mass deportation scheme that Trump is proposing anymore. He has promised the \" largest domestic deportation operation in American history ,\" targeting millions of undocumented immigrants in large-scale raids and then forcibly detaining them in new camps.\n\nWhereas in 2016, 66 percent of Americans opposed mass deportations in a CNN poll, an Axios Vibes survey by the Harris Poll and a CBS/YouGov poll conducted earlier this year showed that between 51 and 62 percent of Americans support such measures. That also includes large shares of Hispanics and Latinos, who support mass deportations at rates between 45 and 53 percent depending on the poll.\n\nSignificant shares of voters have also warmed to the idea of ending birthright citizenship (meaning if someone is born in the US, they are automatically a citizen), with the Axios/Harris poll showing that 30 percent of Democrats and 46 percent of Republicans support it.\n\nVoters appear less sure of Biden's efforts to limit access to asylum, which federal law guarantees to those who face credible fear of harm or persecution in their home countries no matter how they cross the border.\n\nBiden introduced a new policy earlier this year that bars asylum seekers who cross the border without permission from applying for protections in the US when migrant crossings exceed a daily average of 2,500 in a week. Less than half of Americans supported the move in a June Monmouth University poll .\n\nBut it didn't seem to inspire acute opposition among his base either: 38 percent of Democrats and 40 percent of independents approved. In another June Fox News poll, 57 percent of Americans overall supported the policy.\n\nAll of this seems to indicate that Trump's approach to immigration might be more popular than the widespread protests against his immigration policies while he was in office previously suggested.\n\nWhile voters support tougher immigration enforcement, they seem torn about what to do with undocumented immigrants who have put down roots in the US.\n\nIn apparent contradiction to the polling on mass deportations, most Americans appear to support a path to citizenship or legal status for the population of about 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the US as of 2022. An April Pew Research Center poll found that 59 percent of Americans , including 32 percent of Trump supporters, said that undocumented immigrants should be allowed to remain in the US legally.\n\nSupport for a pathway to citizenship for DREAMers - the estimated 3.6 million undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children - is even higher, according to a June National Immigration Forum/Bullfinch Group survey . Only about 530,000 DREAMers are currently shielded from deportation under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, and legislative attempts to provide them with a pathway to citizenship have repeatedly failed over the last decade.\n\nBiden's new program to legalize undocumented spouses of Americans gives these populations some relief and represents the biggest legalization push since DACA. But only about 500,000 spouses and 50,000 stepchildren could be eligible for the new program.\n\nThe polling suggests that there may be room for the next president to pair further legalization efforts with stronger immigration enforcement, as Biden attempted , but ultimately failed, to do in a deal with Congress earlier this year. The question is whether Democrats and Republicans can break from the long-entrenched sides they have staked out on the issue of immigration now that their voters are coalescing around certain policies.\n\nThe lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat - and a closer look at where they should go next.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nDemocrats' struggles to respond to Trump's immigration policies have some deeper, historical roots.\n\nby Christian Paz\n\nThe first few weeks of Donald Trump's second presidency have put Democrats in a frustrating bind.\n\nHe's thrown so much at them (and at the nation), that they're having serious trouble figuring out what to respond to - let alone how. He's signed dozens of executive orders; attempted serious power grabs and overhauls of the government; and signed controversial legislation. And in the process, he's further divided his opposition, as the Democrats undergo an identity crisis that ramped up after Kamala Harris's loss.\n\nImmigration policy is a prime example of this struggle: Long before Harris became their nominee, the party was debating just how much to adjust to both Trump's anti-immigrant campaign promises and to the American public's general shift away from openness to immigration. Now that he's in office, Democrats aren't really lined up to resist every one of the president's anti-immigrant moves - and some are even backing some of his stances.\n\nThe party is now divided into roughly three camps: those in the Senate and House willing to back Trump on certain tough-on-immigration measures, like the recently passed Laken Riley Act ; those who see their constituents supporting some of his positions but are torn over how to vote; and those progressives who are committed to resisting his every move on immigration.\n\nToday's public opinion is one main contributor for the divide: Americans are still largely in favor of more restrictionist immigration policy . Democratic losses in November are another contributor, particularly in areas with large immigrant or nonwhite populations.\n\nBut lawmakers are also confronting longer-standing historical dynamics that have divided the working class and immigrants before. Newer and undocumented immigrants can appear to pose both economic competition and threats to existing senses of identity for immigrants who have already resided in the US, or to those who have assimilated and raised new generations. Combined with a resurgent Republican Party that has capitalized on some of these feelings, these facts might be complicating the Democratic response to Trump now.\n\nOn the campaign trail last year, Trump and various other Republican politicians repeated a specific line of reasoning when making a pitch to nonwhite voters: The \"border invasion\" that Joe Biden and Harris were supposedly responsible for was \"crushing the jobs and wages\" of Black, Latino, and union workers. Trump called it \" economic warfare .\"\n\nThis line of reasoning - that immigrants are taking away economic opportunities from those already in the US - has historically been a source of tension for both native-born Americans, and older immigrants.\n\nMuch of the economics behind this has been challenged by economists , but the politics are still effective. The main claim here is that an influx in cheaper low-skilled laborers not only pushes down the cost of goods but negatively impacts preexisting American workers by lowering their wages as well. The evidence for this actually happening, however, is thin: Immigrants also create demand, by buying new items and using new services, therefore creating more jobs. Still, the idea remains popular.\n\nEven as far back as the civil rights era, this thinking created divisions among left-wing activist movements trying to secure better labor conditions and legal protections. Take the case of the most iconic figure of the Latino labor movement, César Chávez , himself of Mexican descent. As his movement to secure better conditions for farmworkers faced challenges from nonunion, immigrant workers who could help corporate bosses break or alleviate the pressures of labor strikes, his efforts on immigration took a more radical turn .\n\nChávez's United Farm Workers even launched an \"Illegals Campaign\" in the 1970s - an attempt to rally public opposition to immigration and get government officials to crack down on illegal crossings . The UFW even subsidized vigilante patrol efforts along the southern border to try to enforce immigration restrictions when they thought the government wasn't doing enough, and Chávez publicly accused the federal agency in charge of the border and immigration at the time of abdicating their duty to arrest undocumented immigrants who crossed the border.\n\nOf course, Chávez's views were nuanced - and primarily rooted in the goal of creating and strengthening a union that could represent and advocate for farmworkers and laborers left out of the labor movements earlier in the 19th and 20th centuries. But they are great examples of the deep roots that economic and identity status threats have in complicating the views of working-class and nonwhite people in the not-too-distant past.\n\nThis specific opinion has stuck around. Gallup polling since the early 1990s has found that for most of the last 30 years, Americans have tended to hold the opinion that immigration \"mostly hurts\" the economy by \"driving wages down for many Americans.\" And swings in immigration sentiment tend to align with how Americans feel about the state and health of the national economy: When economic opportunity feels scarce, as during the post-pandemic inflationary period, Americans tend to pull back from more generous feelings around both legal and illegal immigration.\n\nWhat makes this era of immigration politics perhaps a bit more complicated on top of those existing economic reasons is the added concerns over fairness and orderliness that many nonwhite Americans, and even immigrants from previous generations, feel.\n\nUS Rep. Juan Vargas, a progressive Democrat who represents San Diego and the part of California that borders Mexico, told me that there's a sense among some of his constituents that recent immigrants, both legal and not, are cutting the line. This feeling about newcomers not paying their dues is, again, a longstanding sentiment among immigrant groups across American history, but it appears updated for the post-pandemic era. While older immigrants feel they have worked hard and waited their turn, they feel newer ones have taken advantage of the asylum system, or gone through less of a struggle than they have.\n\nVargas told me about a conversation he had with a constituent in his district who told him she disagrees with his stance on immigration policy, even though she once \"came across illegally too\" and lived in the US for 15 years without documentation.\n\n\"I started talking to her, and she said, 'You know, these new immigrants, they get everything. They get here and they get everything. We didn't get anything, and so I think they should all be deported,'\" Vargas said. \"I said, 'Oh, so, because you were given a chance, you don't think other people should get that same chance?' She goes, 'Well, it's different.' ... Really, in what way? How is it different? ... And she didn't have a very good answer.\"\n\nSome immigration researchers describe this as part of a \"law-and-order\" mindset: folding border enforcement and immigration crackdowns with a renewed desire by the public for tough-on-crime policies in the post-pandemic era. Last year, the political scientist Matthew Wright described to me this segment of Americans, many of them nonwhite or descended from immigrants. They feel, he said, conflicting emotions about order at the southern border, disorder in how the government is managing it, and how their own communities could be put at risk for a breakdown in the system. They conflate feelings of insecurity and crime with the state of immigration, and come to believe that a broken system is benefitting some while allowing bad apples to slip between the cracks.\n\nThese views help explain why there's a vocal group of Democrats, including Latino Democrats, willing to work with Trump and Republicans specifically on immigration reforms that take a tough-on-crime approach, like the Laken Riley Act, which expedites deportation for undocumented immigrants charged with certain crimes.\n\nSome 46 House Democrats and 12 Senate Democrats ended up voting for the Laken Riley Act, including perhaps the most vocal pro-enforcement Latino Democrat, Sen. Ruben Gallego of Arizona. He argued that the bill represented where the Latino mainstream is now on immigration. \"People are worried about border security, but they also want some sane pathway to immigration reform. That's who I represent. I really represent the middle view of Arizona, which is largely working class and Latino,\" Gallego said after the vote.\n\nEven some Democrats in solid blue areas of the country agree, to an extent. Democratic Rep. Sylvester Turner, who represents Houston and was an outspoken supporter of immigrant rights during Trump's first presidency, told me that his constituents back tougher immigration policies, particularly when it comes to undocumented immigrants charged with violent crimes. He himself didn't vote for the Laken Riley Act because he disagreed with the bill's application to those merely charged or accused of a crime (as opposed to those convicted), but he said that he feels the public's mandate to support other kinds of proposals.\n\n\"People want the border secure,\" he told me. \"People don't want persons who have committed serious, violent crimes in this country. I'm not opposed to [Trump] securing the border, and I'm not opposed to him deporting individuals who have committed serious crimes.\"\n\nAll these divides in how Democrats are responding to Trump leave the party appearing less united than they might want to be, but it reflects where the public is. They're generally okay with bold statements about reducing both legal and illegal immigration , they want something done about the border, but they don't necessarily want Dreamers who were brought illegally to the US as children, or their undocumented neighbors deported.\n\nNone of the Democratic representatives I've spoken to since Trump's victory think the party should be abandoning the defense of immigration as value, but they understand they'll need to be strategic in what they respond to because their constituents are divided too.\n\nThey'll fight back against Trump when he tries to undue birthright citizenship, for example, but they won't necessarily criticize the continued construction of a border wall with Mexico, or increased deportations. They'll point out that deportation flights using military aircraft are mostly for show, while standard ICE-chartered planes can do the job for less. Many supported the bipartisan border bill that Biden tried to pass a little less than a year ago, for example, and would theoretically support it again.\n\nThey oppose the idea of \"mass deportations,\" but because they think the public actually wants more targeted deportations, and even poke fun at the inefficiency of some deportations under Trump's new guidelines, as Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy did recently.\n\nAnd they see room to defend DREAMers, DACA recipients, and those who have benefitted from asylum protections, like temporary protected status, because they see moral value in it, and political value as well: many of those categories of immigrants are popular with Republicans, and polling backs up these nuances.\n\n\"If you start talking about deporting the DREAMers in this country who have gone through our schools, graduated from our universities, and now can contribute back to this society, if you're talking about deporting them, that's going to be an issue,\" Turner said. \"There's going to be opposition if you talk about deporting children, or going into churches and schools and hospitals, and harassing our kids. But if you want to bring back the bill the Republicans and Democrats were prepared to sign last year, I think you will find support there.\"\n\nThese nuances over immigration policy specifically, therefore, encapsulate a bit of an overarching question Democrats are continuing to grapple with: how to resist and oppose a president who has some public support for policies they might not individually favor. So far, they're picking and choosing their battles. But public opinion won't stay static forever, and the opposition will have to evolve with it.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue. But the benefits of fighting his lawless deportations are worth the political risks.\n\nCanary Mission, the controversial organization targeting student activists, explained.\n\nA conversation with Sen. Chris Van Hollen about Kilmar Abrego Garcia's detention - and where America goes from here.\n\nAs Trump wages war against Harvard, something unprecedented is happening on Florida's college campuses.\n\n﻿In an unusual overnight order, most of the justices voted to halt several illegal deportations.\n\n﻿Biden got immigration wrong. But there's something both parties can agree on.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC. All Rights Reserved"

Asylees are foreigners in the U.S. who are granted protection by immigration judges or asylum officers. Both populations have to prove they could face persecution because of certain characteristics, such as their political views, race or religion.\n\nThe Trump administration has targeted both congressionally enacted programs, suspending the refugee process and closing the asylum system at the U.S.-Mexico border through executive orders that are currently facing federal court challenges.\n\nIn a statement, the Department of Homeland Security confirmed CBS News' reporting, saying the green card processing pause is needed to comply with two executive actions issued by President Trump, including one that questioned immigration vetting procedures under the Biden administration.\n\n\"USCIS is placing a temporary pause on finalizing certain Adjustment of Status applications pending the completion of additional screening and vetting to identify potential fraud, public safety, or national security concerns, in alignment\" with Mr. Trump's executive actions, DHS said in the statement. \"Adjustment of status\" is the official name of the green card process.\n\nIn one of the presidential proclamations cited by officials, Mr. Trump instructed federal agencies to \"vet and screen to the maximum degree possible all aliens who intend to be admitted, enter, or are already inside the United States.\"\n\nThe other executive order cited by officials paved the way for the State Department to designate Mexican cartels and gangs like Tren de Aragua as foreign terrorist organizations.\n\nThe pause on some green card applications is the latest action taken by the Trump administration to restrict, tighten and, in some cases, suspend legal immigration procedures on the basis of concerns about national security and fraud.\n\nLast month, the administration, citing vetting and fraud concerns, paused all immigration applications filed by immigrants from Latin America and Ukraine who arrived in the U.S. under two Biden-era programs that relied on an authority known as humanitarian parole. The government did not announce that move publicly, but CBS News disclosed it on Feb. 19.\n\nThe administration said last week it would give over half a million migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela who came to the U.S. under one of the programs 30 days to self-deport or face arrest and deportation. Trump officials have claimed the migrants were \"loosely vetted\" by the Biden administration and noted the program was plagued by fraud concerns.\n\nTrump administration officials have also announced plans to more heavily scrutinize and review the social media accounts of immigrants applying for legal status, including U.S. citizenship, green cards and asylum. USCIS said the vetting of social media accounts is required for \"the enhanced identity verification, vetting and national security screening.\"\n\nThe agency has long reviewed the social media information of immigrants applying for certain immigration benefits, but the new plan would require those applicants to submit their social media accounts, or handles, to the government for review.\n\nCamilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

Officials are urging migrants to use the newly repurposed CBP Home smartphone app to register for self-deportation.\n\nBut DHS said it retains the authority to target migrants who arrived under this program before the 30-day period lapses. Officials say those prioritized for arrest will include migrants who have failed to apply for another immigration benefit like asylum or a green card.\n\nIn a statement, DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said the migrants allowed into the U.S. under the CHNV process were \"loosely vetted,\" and argued the program undercut American workers.\n\n\"The termination of the CHNV parole programs, and the termination of parole for those who exploited it, is a return to common-sense policies, a return to public safety, and a return to America First,\" McLaughlin added.\n\nFriday's announcement is the latest effort by the Trump administration to discontinue humanitarian-based immigration programs that allow migrants to enter or stay in the country with the government's permission.\n\nThe CHNV program in question was hailed by the Biden administration as a successful policy that reduced illegal border crossings by migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and, to a lesser extent, Venezuela. But Republicans denounced it as an effort to circumvent the limits Congress placed on legal immigration, and noted that the program had some recorded instances of fraud .\n\nThe Biden administration last fall made a decision not to allow CHNV beneficiaries to renew their two-year work permits under the program, saying they could apply for other benefits, like asylum and Temporary Protected Status. That prospect, however, changed dramatically when Mr. Trump took office.\n\nHis administration has already announced plans to phase out the TPS programs for Haitians and Venezuelans. It also suspended all pending immigration benefit applications filed by those who arrived under CHNV, citing concerns about fraud and vetting .\n\nCamilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

      "text": "U.S. pauses immigration applications for certain migrants welcomed under Biden\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  February 19, 2025 / 3:57 PM EST / CBS News\n\nThe Trump administration has enacted a pause on all immigration applications filed by migrants from Latin America and Ukraine allowed into the U.S. under certain Biden-era programs, citing fraud and security concerns, according to two U.S. officials and an internal memo obtained by CBS News.\n\nThe application freeze will remain in place indefinitely while government officials work to identify potential cases of fraud and enhance vetting procedures to mitigate concerns related to national security and public safety, according to the directive.\n\nThe move, which had not been previously reported, threatens to cast a cloud of uncertainty over many migrants who were in the process of applying for various immigration benefits that would allow them to stay in the U.S. legally and, in some cases, permanently.\n\nWhile the exact number of affected migrants is unclear, the hold on applications applies to several Biden administration programs that allowed hundreds of thousands of foreigners to come to the U.S. legally through an immigration law known as parole. That law empowers the U.S. government to welcome foreigners quickly on humanitarian or public benefit grounds.\n\nThe Biden administration used parole at an unprecedented scale, partially to encourage migrants to sign up for legal migration channels instead of crossing the southern border unlawfully. The Trump administration moved swiftly to suspend those efforts, arguing that they abused the parole authority.\n\nThe Trump administration had previously halted new entries under Biden-era parole policies. But in a memo dated Feb. 14, Andrew Davidson, a top U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services official, ordered an agency-wide \"administrative pause\" on all \"pending benefit requests\" filed by migrants already allowed into the U.S. under three Biden administration programs.\n\nThey include a policy, called Uniting for Ukraine, set up to offer a safe haven to those fleeing the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Roughly 240,000 Ukrainians with American sponsors arrived in the U.S. under that process before President Trump took office. Another affected program, known as CHNV, allowed 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans sponsored by American citizens to enter the U.S.\n\nThe third impacted program consists of processes that permitted some Colombians, Ecuadorians, Central Americans, Haitians and Cubans with American relatives to come to the U.S. to wait for a family-based green card to become available.\n\nBecause those allowed into the U.S. under these programs were only given temporary work permits and deportation protections that typically last for two years, many of them applied for other immigration benefits, lawyers and experts said.\n\nThose benefits include a program known as Temporary Protected Status for migrants from crisis-stricken countries like Haiti, Ukraine and Venezuela; asylum, which allows those fleeing persecution to gain a permanent safe haven in the U.S.; and green cards, or permanent American residency. Because of a Cold War-era law, Cubans paroled into the U.S. are eligible to apply for green cards.\n\nBut under the internal USCIS directive, officials will no longer be able to process any applications for these programs or any other benefit if the requests were filed by migrants who arrived in the U.S. under the targeted Biden administration policies.\n\n\"This effectively freezes their ability to move into another legal status,\" said Lynden Melmed, who served as the top lawyer at USCIS during the administration of former President George W. Bush and now works as a partner at Berry Appleman & Leiden LLP. \"In the interim, they would remain susceptible to removal from the country if the government terminates their parole status.\"\n\nThe USCIS memo said the move is justified because \"[c]urrently, fraud information and public safety or national security concerns are not being properly flagged in USCIS' adjudicative systems.\" The directive cites the Biden administration's move last year to temporarily pause the parole initiative for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans due to fraud concerns.\n\nIn his memo, Davidson referenced investigations that he said found thousands of CHNV applications with \"serial sponsors,\" information of deceased individuals or identical addresses. He said some of those cases were proven to be fraud. Davidson also said some migrants allowed into the U.S. under CHNV \"were not fully vetted.\"\n\nThe pause, Davidson said in his memo, could potentially be lifted, but only once officials complete a \"comprehensive review and evaluation of the in-country population of aliens who are or were paroled into the United States under these categorical parole programs.\"\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, the Department of Homeland Security confirmed CBS News' reporting, saying the \"administrative hold\" on applications would be in effect \"pending the completion of additional vetting to identity any fraud, public safety, or national security concerns.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has targeted those who've come to the U.S. under the Biden-era immigration parole programs in other ways, too.\n\nLast month, officials authorized federal immigration agents to seek the deportation - including in an expedited fashion in some cases - of those permitted to enter the U.S. under the CHNV program and other Biden administration parole policies. The administration has also drafted plans to revoke the parole status of many of those who've come to the U.S. under CHNV.\n\nCamilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.

      "text": "What rights do green card holders have? Immigration experts answer questions around Mahmoud Khalil's case\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  March 24, 2025 / 5:01 PM EDT / CBS News\n\nThe arrest of Mahmoud Khalil , a green card holder and former Columbia University student involved in pro-Palestinian campus protests in 2024, has raised questions about the rights of permanent residents in the United States.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement agents arrested Khalil , a lawful U.S. resident married to an American citizen, in New York on March 8. He is currently being held in Louisiana.\n\nKhalil is not facing criminal charges. The Trump administration initially argued it could deport him on foreign policy grounds and later accused him of immigration fraud .\n\nHere's what to know about the rights of green card holders:\n\nA green card, or a Permanent Resident Card, allows non-citizens to live and work permanently in the United States. Individuals can be eligible for a green card through family, employment, refugee status and other reasons.\n\nMost green cards are valid for 10 years and then need to be renewed, similar to how U.S. citizens need to renew their passports, explained David Leopold, an immigration law expert and partner at UB Greensfelder.\n\n\"The card expires, but the residency doesn't expire,\" he said, adding if a card is \"not renewed, there could be ramifications because you have to maintain the registration, but the status itself never expires assuming the person complies with the law.\"\n\nThere are a number of reasons why an individual could lose their green card and be deported.\n\n\"Any green card holder can be subject to deportation depending on the situation,\" Leopold said.\n\nMost cases occur because a green card holder commits a crime, including violent crimes, marriage fraud, controlled substance abuse and other offenses. If they are convicted, typically after they serve their sentence in the U.S., they would face removal proceedings that involve going before an immigration judge, Leopold said.\n\nA person can also lose their permanent resident status because of \"substantiated charges of immigration fraud in the immigration process,\" Elora Mukherjee, a Columbia Law School professor and director of the university's Immigrants' Rights Clinic, said.\n\nMukherjee said people whose green cards are being revoked are typically given a notice to appear before an immigration judge.\n\n\"They have the opportunity to either contest why they should be allowed to keep their status or concede that their status can be taken away,\" she said. \"Lawful permanent residents can't be stripped of their status in the United States without any due process.\"\n\nThe severity of the crime may affect the judge's decision. In cases of violent crimes, \"deportation becomes nearly automatic,\" Leopold said. In some cases, an individual may be able to ask a judge to cancel their deportation. The judge would have to decide whether the person's conviction is outweighed by other considerations, such as community ties, family ties or their work in the U.S., he explained, but added, \"that doesn't apply to every case.\"\n\nThe procedure for how a green card holder's status could be revoked is set by the Immigration and Nationality Act , Mukherjee said.\n\nUnder the act, green card holders do not need to be convicted of a crime to be deported, Jaclyn Kelley-Widmer, an immigration law professor at Cornell Law School, told The Associated Press . For example, if there are reasonable grounds to believe they engaged in, or are likely to engage in, terrorist activities, they could be deported, she said.\n\nAnother reason a green card holder could lose their status is if they leave the United States for too long.\n\n\"Typically if they stay out of the United States for more than a year,\" their status will be challenged when they come back, Leopold said.\n\nA green card holder is not a citizen. To become a naturalized citizen , they would need to apply and meet various requirements.\n\nEveryone in the United States is protected by the U.S. Constitution. This includes green card holders, visa holders and undocumented immigrants.\n\nBut, unlike citizens, green card holders are susceptible to being removed if they violate their status in the U.S., Leopold said.\n\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act is a set of immigration law provisions enacted in 1952.\n\nThe act includes numerous grounds for deportation, including a provision that says a non-citizen \"whose presence or activities in the United States the Secretary of State has reasonable ground to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States is deportable.\"\n\nA government document filed on March 9 and obtained by CBS News shows the Trump administration used this provision to argue Khalil is subject to removal from the United States.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt alleged on March 11 that Khalil has distributed \"pro-Hamas\" flyers. Hamas, a U.S. designated terrorist group that has governed the Gaza Strip since 2007, is responsible for the deadly Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza .\n\nKhalil's wife, Noor Abdalla, said in an interview with \"CBS Sunday Morning\" that the allegation he circulated pro-Hamas flyers is not true, and his attorney, Amy Greer, said in a statement his detention was illegal.\n\n\"He was chosen as an example to stifle entirely lawful dissent, in violation of the First Amendment,\" Greer said.\n\nMatthew Boaz, an assistant professor at the University of Kentucky's J. David Rosenberg College of Law, wrote in a Lawfare article that \"one cannot simply be stripped of their residency, even by Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\"\n\nCases alleging grounds for deportation go before a federal immigration judge, who works for the Department of Justice, \"so it's not an independent judiciary,\" Leopold said.\n\n\"The law requires that the government make its proof by clear and convincing evidence,\" which is the highest standard in civil law, but not as high as beyond a reasonable doubt, required in criminal cases, Leopold explained.\n\nThe particular foreign policy provision referenced by the administration is rarely used, Leopold said, calling it \"a vestige of the Cold War.\"\n\nThe administration later cited other grounds to deport Khalil in a federal court filing on March 17, accusing him of immigration fraud. The government alleges that on his green card paperwork, he did not disclose his work or involvement with UNRWA, the United Nations agency for Palestine refugees; the Syria office in the British embassy in Beirut; and a group known as Columbia University Apartheid Divest.\n\nKhalil was arrested in New York by federal immigration authorities. He was first brought to a detention center in New Jersey and then flown to another site in Jena, Louisiana, his lawyers said.\n\n\"Louisiana is home to several ICE detention facilities and it's fairly common for non-citizens who are facing removal proceedings to be transferred to places like Louisiana due to available detention space in that state,\" Robin Nunn, a legal analyst and trial attorney, told CBS News 24/7 on March 11.\n\nKhalil's attorneys are trying to reverse his transfer to Louisiana, calling it \"blatantly improper.\"\n\nKatrina  Kaufman contributed to this report.\n\nNicole Brown Chau is a deputy managing editor for CBSNews.com.

      "text": "Trump is targeting illegal immigration at the U.S.-Canada border. Here's how some migrants cross there.\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nMarch 23, 2025 / 7:50 PM EDT / CBS News\n\nAn upstate New York sheriff, whose county sits along the U.S.-Canada border, credits President Trump's immigration policies for a recent lull in illegal immigration , but warned that he doesn't believe the quiet will last.\n\nSheriff David Favro oversees Clinton County, New York, which includes about 28 miles of the northern border region the U.S. Customs and Border Protection calls the Swanton Sector. Last year, there were more illegal crossings in the Swanton Sector than in the previous 17 years combined, with more than 19,000 migrants arrested. Favro, a Democrat and six-time elected sheriff, said there's been a recent lull.\n\n\"Today, our state of mind is, 'When is something gonna happen?' That's the big concern. And that's always in the back of, I think, every law enforcement member's mind,\" Favro said. \"When is something going to occur? When the numbers are down it gets eerily quiet and we kind of worry about quiet.\"\n\nWhile the southern border saw 1.5 million illegal crossings last year, there were fewer than 24,000 illegal crossings from Canada. More than 80% of migrant apprehensions at the northern border happened in the Swanton Sector last year.\n\nThe migrants arrested last year came from 97 countries, but were mostly from India and Mexico. They cross year round, even through blizzards. In the middle of winter, authorities respond weekly to 911 calls from migrants. Six Haitians, including a 9-year-old girl, became lost in the woods and some were hospitalized with serious injuries in January. Last month, a man from Spain suffered severe frostbite.\n\n\"They're up against a lot. And the worst thing that they're up against is the freezing cold , because the temperatures, you're walking through the snow and your pants are getting wet, your boots are gonna start soaking through eventually, and they don't even realize,\" Favro said. \"They're so desperate and so quick to try and get to where they want to be, that they don't realize frostbite is setting in. And that's one of the biggest dangers.\"\n\nFavro said he will never forget the death of Ana Vazquez-Flores, a pregnant woman who died while trekking across the border in the snow in 2023. Vazquez-Flores and her husband had found a Colombian man living in Quebec who advertised smuggling services on TikTok. They'd hired him to guide Vazquez-Flores across the border.\n\nSearching for \"border excursions\" on TikTok and Facebook brings up a number of ads purporting to guarantee migrants safe passage across America's 5,525 mile-long shared border with Canada. There are posts in Spanish, English and Punjabi, and reviews from clients.\n\n60 Minutes found one smuggler, who goes by the name Javi, through his online ads, which he says TikTok recently took down. Javi said he works for the Sinaloa Cartel arranging human and drug smuggling across America's northern border.\n\nWhile it's not possible to verify everything Javi said, he sent pictures of guns he says are his as proof of his cartel ties. A source in Canadian intelligence said Javi's story is consistent with the cartel's human and drug smuggling operations.\n\nJavi said the cartel provides the customers.\n\n\"They have more people who are behind all of this looking for customers, finding them, and summoning them to certain locations,\" he said in Spanish.\n\nJavi said he's part of a team of four. Some drive migrants to and from the border and plan logistics, while Javi says he guides people through the woods. Migrants pay about $3,000 each: Javi said he makes about a thousand dollars per person, while $500 goes to the cartel and the rest to the drivers. Migrants who fail to pay are held hostage until they pay, Javi said.\n\nSome smugglers offer discounts for children. Javi said he's guided families with babies as young as three months across the border.\n\nMr. Trump has instituted tariffs on Mexico and Canada, at times linking them to the drugs and migrants coming across America's borders.\n\n\"Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long simmering problem,\" he said in a November Truth Social post . \"We hereby demand that they use this power, and until such time that they do, it is time for them to pay a very big price!\"\n\nCanada's new Prime Minister Mark Carney retaliated with tariffs of his own, but the Canadian government did concede to Mr. Trump's complaints about the border and announced a nearly billion dollar plan to strengthen border security, adding more boots on the ground, helicopters and drones and a new fentanyl czar.\n\nProfessor Kelly Sundberg, who spent 15 years as an officer in the Canadian Border Services Agency and now researches border security at Mount Royal University in Calgary, said Canada does not have a border patrol like the one in the U.S. and has many fewer immigration enforcement officers.\n\n\"Clearly, if we're going to address the concerns of President Trump, let alone the concerns of many Canadians also, ...we need to increase those numbers,\" Sundberg said.\n\nHe believes that Canada needs 4,000-5,000 officers added nationally. He also doesn't see tariffs as the answer.\n\n\"The border needs to be secured, but there's better ways of doing it than threatening your largest and longest standing partner,\" he said.\n\nIt's unknown exactly how many pounds of drugs cross the border into the United States. Mr. Trump claims \"tremendous\" amounts of fentanyl pour into the country through Canada, but last year, U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the northern border, compared to more than 21,000 pounds confiscated at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nLast month Canada and the U.S., on the same day, declared the Sinaloa Cartel a terrorist organization. Javi, the smuggler, said the cartel has since had to change the way it moves drugs across the northern border, but the designation has not affected how many people they smuggle into the U.S. illegally.\n\n\"There's always going to be business. Later on, Donald Trump's time will pass, and this will continue,\" Javi said. \"This is not going to stop.\"\n\nJavi claims more border control and more checkpoints will not stop smugglers from moving people across the border.\n\n\"There's always a way. The border between Canada and the U.S. is much bigger than the one with Mexico,\" he said. \"You can always get in.\"\n\nCecilia Vega is an Emmy Award-winning journalist and \"60 Minutes\" correspondent who joined the CBS newsmagazine in 2023.\n\n© 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "text": "U.S. immigration authorities are detaining European travelers, weighing on tourism\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  March 21, 2025 / 11:25 AM EDT / CBS/AP\n\nSome Europeans are becoming leery of visiting the U.S., as reports of U.S. immigration authorities detaining them while traveling, for reasons that are not clear, swirl.\n\nA number of tourists from Europe say they have been stopped at U.S. border crossings and held at U.S. immigration detention facilities for weeks, despite holding tourist permits, work visas, or otherwise believing that they are authorized to travel to the U.S.\n\nA backpacker from Wales was detained at the Canadian border for close to three weeks, before being permitted to fly home. A Canadian woman with a work visa was detained for 12 days at the Tijuana border, before returning to Canada.\n\nAnd German tourist Lucas Sielaff, who drove to Mexico from Las Vegas, where he was visiting his American fiancé, was locked up while returning from Tijuana. Immigration authorities accused him of violating the rules of his 90-day U.S. tourist permit, the couple said, despite being just 22 days into it. Sielaff was held for 16 days before he was permitted to fly home to Germany on his own dime.\n\nSielaff and others who were detained said it was never made clear why they were taken into custody.\n\n\"What happened at the border was just blatant abuse of the Border Patrol's power,\" his fiancé, Lennon Tyler, told the Associated Press.\n\nPedro Rios, director of the American Friends Service Committee, a nonprofit that aids migrants, agreed that \"the rationale for detaining these people doesn't make sense.\"\n\n\"The only reason I see is there is a much more fervent anti-immigrant atmosphere,\" Rios told the Associated Press.\n\nU.S. authorities did not respond to a request from The Associated Press for figures on the number of tourists that have been held at detention facilities. Immigration and Customs Enforcement told the AP that Sielaff was deemed \"inadmissible\" by Customs and Border Protection, without providing more specifics. Generally speaking, they said that \"if statutes or visa terms are violated, travelers may be subject to detention and removal.\"\n\nUniversities have warned international faculty and students to consider refraining from traveling abroad, pointing to the Trump Administration's evolving federal travel policies.\n\n\"Out of an abundance of caution, we encourage international students, staff, faculty and scholars - including U.S. visa holders and permanent residents (or 'green card holders') - to consider postponing or delaying personal travel outside the United States until more information is available from the U.S. Department of State,\" Brown University executive vice president for planning and policy Russell Carey, wrote in an email to the Brown community.\n\nA recent analysis shows that President Trump's trade war could also dissuade tourists from visiting the U.S. just by alienating key allies and trade partners.\n\nData from Tourism Economics, a branch of investment advisory firm Oxford Economics, is forecasting a 15% drop in the number of visits from Canada in 2025.\n\nInternational travel from all foreign countries to the U.S. is expected to drop by just over 5%, according to the report. Factoring in diminished spending by Americans traveling domestically this year, overall travel spending in the U.S. could drop up to $64 billion in 2025, according to Tourism Economics.\n\n\"The negative effects of an expanded trade war scenario will reach U.S. hotel room demand in 2025,\" Tourism Economics said in the report. \"Domestic travel will be negatively affected by slower income growth and higher prices while international travel to the U.S. will be hit by a trifecta of slower economies, a stronger dollar and antipathy toward the U.S.\"\n\n© 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "text": "I'm a business immigration lawyer. I thought Trump's second term might have positive effects on highly skilled immigrants, but I've lost hope.\n\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a transcribed conversation in early March with 49-year-old Tahmina Watson, a business immigration lawyer in Seattle. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've enjoyed working in immigration law because I can impact people's lives and do challenging and interesting work.\n\nI opened the doors to my law firm, Watson Immigration Law, in 2009.\n\nWe help foreign-born entrepreneurs find the best visa pathways for starting their companies in the US and provide immigration assistance to companies that are trying to expand into the US.\n\nMany companies we work with are looking for top-notch talent, so they often hire people graduating from Ph.D. or master's programs on student visas who will require a visa sponsorship. We help people in various industries - including health and tech, since Seattle is a tech-savvy area - apply for various visas, including H-1Bs, O-1s, and EB-1s.\n\nSince the Trump administration has come to power, new immigration directives are creating fear and resulting in increased scrutiny for my clients.\n\nThe executive orders that have come down one after another have caused a lot of fear among the clients I work with.\n\nLet's take the birthright citizenship one as an example. We're seeing suggestions that no one except green card holders and US citizens would be able to have children who receive citizenship at birth. This leaves the potential children of a lot of the visa holders we work with out of the equation.\n\nOften, those with H-1B visas - a temporary employment visa - live in the States while they're trying to get a green card, so they continue to extend their visa.\n\nLife doesn't stop while you're waiting for a green card ; there is at least security for their kids if they had children during this period.\n\nIt's difficult to predict whether this executive order will be implemented. Judges have blocked the order. Birthright citizenship is guaranteed under the US Constitution, so there would likely have to be a constitutional amendment.\n\nI'm seeing people looking into alternative ways to get a green card, and some people are looking to leave the country. There's a lot of interest in Canada because of the time zone and also the proximity, which is useful for business operations. In 2023, Canada launched a program to attract US H-1B holders, and the application threshold was met within 48 hours. I think we'll see more interest in the coming months and weeks.\n\nBusinesses, particularly those in the hospitality industry, are nervous about raids , during which immigration officers check if businesses have undocumented workers. While they've verified employee work authorization documents, they can't be certain if these documents are authentic.\n\nRaids have already happened in multiple states, and businesses have been asking how they can prepare. We've guided our clients so they have their paperwork ready for audits.\n\nThe Trump administration made an executive order to enhance vetting at consulates, and I think this is partly why some of my clients have experienced issues at consulates. We recently had an L-1A approved for a client. When they arrived at the consulate in Brazil, the embassy initially refused it and asked for a lot of documentation before approving it.\n\nThat same day, we heard of an unexpected refusal of one of our clients in India for a visa for religious workers because the consular officer questioned the nature of their work.\n\nWhile increased scrutiny at consulates can occur, the timing and severity of these cases indicate a possible influence from recent Department of State directives . This development makes me concerned about future visa approvals across the board.\n\nWe recently received a denial for an EB-1 visa for a well-qualified startup founder. Months ago, I think filing for him wouldn't have raised any questions at all. We're trying to figure out what to do, but it's having knock-on effects on his team already.\n\nThese are things we've never heard of before. It's almost like they're throwing spaghetti on the wall at every single aspect of immigration. For the moment, everything is sticking because the litigation that has followed will take time to unfold. In the meantime, the damage is being done to people.\n\nI'm concerned about the potential impact of these changes on the American consumer. If businesses have work visas denied , their services will be strained.\n\nMany changes to immigration policies are still in process, and we're yet to see how they'll unfold fully.\n\nDuring President Donald Trump's first term, my team saw heightened scrutiny of H-1B and O-1 visas; I think more is coming.\n\nMy line of work is stressful. Livelihoods and an ecosystem of businesses are affected. If one person goes, there's a domino effect. I'm trying to make sure I take care of myself this time around.\n\nI actually felt some optimism before the inauguration. H-1Bs were receiving positive attention following statements from Elon Musk and other leaders, and during his campaign, Trump also said graduates should get green cards.\n\nI thought that maybe we'd see some positive effects for high-skilled, legal immigration.\n\nBut so far, we're not seeing that, and I've lost hope that we'll see good changes.\n\nThe White House didn't respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nHave a tip?

      "text": "Canada, China, and European nations are warning tourists about traveling to the US\n\nCanada has further tightened its advisory on travel to the US.\n\nThe country is one of several that have updated their guidance since President Donald Trump began his second term as president.\n\nAdvisories range from stricter immigration enforcement and changes to transgender rights after reports of foreign travelers being detained by immigration authorities.\n\nHere's how Canada, China, and European countries have updated their travel guidance.\n\nCanada warned travelers on April 4 to \"expect scrutiny at ports of entry, including of electronic devices.\"\n\nIt said Canadians should \"comply and be forthcoming in all interactions with border authorities.\"\n\nThis comes after more reports of travelers being turned away at the US border. France's higher education minister told Agence France-Presse that a scientist had been denied entry to the US after he was found to have sent texts criticizing Trump.\n\nThe update also said travelers should \"be prepared to show evidence of your legal presence in the US\" at any time.\n\nCanada's previous update told citizens staying in the US for more than 30 days to register with the US government, following reports of a Canadian detained by ICE for two weeks.\n\nA Department of Homeland Security rule, effective April 11, makes registration mandatory. \"Failure to comply with the registration requirement could result in penalties, fines, and misdemeanor prosecution,\" the advisory said.\n\nChina 's culture and tourism ministry issued a travel warning on April 9, citing worsening Sino-US economic and trade relations and the US domestic security situation. It advised Chinese tourists to \"fully assess the risks of traveling to the United States and travel with caution.\"\n\nA trade war has escalated between the two countries since Trump imposed 34% tariffs on imports from China as part of his sweeping tariff program. Beijing retaliated with its own tariffs on US imports of 84% .\n\nGermany 's advisory warns that a US visa or entry waiver doesn't guarantee admission. \"Criminal records, false information, or even slight visa overstays can lead to arrest, detention, and deportation,\" it says, following reports of three Germans held and interrogated for weeks.\n\nThe UK 's Foreign Ministry issued a similar warning after a British traveler was denied entry at the US-Canada border and held in a US ICE processing center for 19 days. The advisory says the US strictly enforces entry rules. \"Failure to comply may result in arrest or detention.\"\n\nDenmark, Finland, France, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, and Belgium have all issued warnings about new US policies affecting transgender travelers.\n\nIn January, President Donald Trump signed an executive order recognizing only two sexes - male and female - prompting countries to update their travel advisories.\n\nDenmark 's March 20 update advised those with an \"X\" gender marker in their passports to contact the US Embassy before travel.\n\nFinland 's advisory, updated on March 25, advises applicants to put their gender at birth. \"If the applicant's recorded gender differs from their birth sex, US authorities may deny entry.\"\n\nIt also cautions that overstaying or misrepresenting a stay's purpose could lead to arrest or deportation.\n\nFrance 's March 24 update urges travelers to ensure their visas reflect their sex assigned at birth and to check with the US Embassy and airlines for policy changes.\n\nIreland 's advisory, also updated on March 24, notes that those with an \"X\" marker or a passport gender differing from sex at birth should contact the US Embassy in Dublin.\n\nThe Netherlands ' foreign ministry, meanwhile, advises that US visa applications only accept \"M\" or \"F\" as gender markers.\n\nNorway 's March 24 update says that holding a visa doesn't guarantee entry, as immigration officers have final discretion. It also states that the US \"only recognizes an applicant's gender at birth.\"\n\nBelgium's March 26 update says LGBTQ+ legislation \"varies widely\" in the US and urges applicants to check new gender registration rules.\n\nPortugal's advisory , updated on March 25, advises that travelers who identify as nonbinary complete forms using their gender at birth.\n\nMore people are losing interest in traveling to the US, seemingly due to the Trump administration's policies and tariffs.\n\nStatistics Canada data released last month shows the number of Canadians driving to the US fell 23% in February compared with the same month last year.\n\nMeanwhile, travel data firm OAG said airline bookings between Canada and the US are down 70% compared with last year. Air Canada and WestJet said they hadn't seen such stark declines but are paring capacity.\n\nHotel bookings for Europeans visiting the US this summer have also fallen by a quarter, Accor CEO Sébastien Bazin told Bloomberg.\n\nTourism Economics originally projected a 9% increase in international visitors to the US this year but last month revised that to a 5% decrease, pointing to trade tensions.\n\nAdam Sacks, the consultancy's president, cited Trump's tariffs, \"imperialistic\" rhetoric, and reports of foreign travelers being detained by US immigration officials as \"significant hurdles for the US travel industry.\"\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Trump orders troops to seal the borders and declares a national immigration emergency\n\nPresident Donald Trump upon arriving at the White House on Monday signed executive orders declaring a national emergency at the US-Mexico border and designating cartel organizations as \"foreign terrorist organizations,\" ramping up his focus on immigration in his second term.\n\n\"I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country,\" he said during his inaugural speech earlier in the day at the Capitol.\n\nLater, at the White House, Trump signed an order instructing the Secretary of Defense to send him a plan within 10 days to task US Northern Command with securing the border. Trump's advisors have said they were not concerned about laws limiting US troops' involvement in domestic law enforcement.\n\n\"As Commander in Chief, I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions and that is exactly what I am going to do,\" he continued. \"We will do it at a level nobody has ever seen before.\n\nTrump also signed an executive order attempting to end birthright citizenship, a highly controversial move but one championed by many conservatives. Legal scholars have been clear that no president can unilaterally overrule the Constitution, meaning historic legal fights are almost guaranteed to follow.\n\nThe president also said he'd reinstate his Remain in Mexico policy and \"end the practice of catch and release.\"\n\nThe Remain in Mexico policy - which was launched in 2019 during Trump's first term - mandates that migrants seeking asylum to remain in Mexico pending their immigration court date in the US.\n\nThroughout his campaign, Trump argued that deportations could benefit the US economy. He has said that removing large numbers of people in the country illegally could open job opportunities for US-born workers and legal immigrants and could bring housing prices down.\n\nBusiness Insider has spoken to over a dozen immigration researchers and policy analysts across the political spectrum. While some conservative-leaning researchers said reducing the number of people coming into the US and living in the country illegally, along with large-scale mass deportations , is necessary to protect American safety and could have long-term economic benefits, left- and center-leaning researchers said there may be economic shocks .\n\nThe US had an estimated 11.7 million immigrants living in the US illegally as of July 2023, per the most recent numbers from the Center for Migration Studies. As many as 8.3 million people in this demographic work, per CMS estimates .\n\nMass deportations could have significant economic consequences, some researchers told BI. The American Immigration Council estimated that a \"one-time mass deportation operation\" would directly cost the federal government $315 billion, accounting for detainments, arrests, legal processing, and removals.\n\nIn interviews and speeches, Trump has stressed his belief that the US has had no choice but to carry out large-scale deportations. He also confirmed plans to use the military for deportation efforts in November, along with using a 1798 law allowing for the deportation of suspected gang and cartel members.\n\nBefore Inauguration Day, Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, told ABC News that the administration was reviewing plans for immigration raids in Chicago. Trump has threatened to crack down on illegal immigration in communities in Colorado and Ohio , whose high concentrations of immigrants have drawn national attention.\n\nWhen asked about potential raids, Trump told reporters he did not want to discuss the specific timing of such operations.\n\nHoman previously stressed that deportations would not involve sweeps of immigrant-heavy neighborhoods and would instead target immigrants with criminal records.\n\nIn private meetings, Homan told Republican lawmakers to tone down expectations for initial deportations due to limited resources. Homan told CNN he would need at least 100,000 beds to carry out detainment plans.\n\nCNN also reported that Homan and lawmakers discussed a plan to target the 1.4 million people with final immigration orders of removal as part of a tiered approach to deportation. Concerns have risen about ICE's lack of space for a heightened number of detainees, as well as various legal challenges to its plans for deportations.\n\nOther plans include working with local and state law enforcement agencies and reassigning law enforcement officials to ICE officers, The New York Times reported. The Trump team may also expand expedited removal, the process of removing noncitizens without a hearing and drafting limitations on birthright citizenship, such as ceasing to issue passports to children born in the US to immigrant parents who live in the US illegally.\n\nTrump named Stephen Miller , the chief architect of Trump's first-term travel ban, as Homeland Security advisor and White House deputy chief of staff.\n\nThe border has calmed down recently. US Border Patrol calculated 47,330 migrant encounters along the southwest border in December, among the lowest since mid-2020 - and an over 80% reduction since December 2023.\n\nDuring Trump's first term in office, the US deported about 1.5 million people. Between January 2021 and August 2024, when Biden held office, more than 1.4 million deportations were carried out.\n\nOne of Trump's arguments about immigrants is that they steal jobs from native-born workers. Recent research shows that US-born employment increases with immigration, and deportations hurt native job numbers.\n\n\"US-born workers do not simply take all the jobs left behind by immigrants after they are deported,\" Chloe East, a fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies immigration policy, told BI. \"This is because these jobs are lower-paid, more dangerous, and otherwise less desirable than the jobs more often taken by US-born workers.\"\n\nThe US has already seen examples of this in its recent history. Around 400,000 people were deported between 2008 and 2014 through a program called Secure Communities . Research published in October showed industries experienced heightened worker shortages as a result.\n\nThis also included the construction workforce, which employs among the highest numbers of workers living in the US illegally.\n\n\"The labor market is already tense and tight, and construction is one of those industries that doesn't have enough workers,\" Jennie Murray, president and CEO of the immigrant advocacy nonprofit group National Immigration Forum, told BI. She added that deportations could worsen housing shortages in the US.\n\nConsumers may feel the effects of deportations at the grocery store, as a reduced agricultural workforce could mean less locally sourced food and higher prices. A Center for American Progress analysis from 2021 found that nearly 300,000 workers living in the US illegally were in agriculture and farming - around 13% of the 2.3 million workers in the agriculture sector that year.\n\nImmigrants living in the US illegally also contribute significantly to taxes and government programs. In 2022, they paid $96.7 billion in federal, state, and local taxes, per the most recent data from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy . They paid $25.7 billion in Social Security taxes and $6.4 billion in Medicare taxes while being ineligible to receive benefits from those social insurance programs.\n\nHowever, Republicans have argued that welfare programs and taxpayer-subsidized health insurance for immigrants have cost US residents billions, potentially partly offsetting these gains.\n\nSome think tanks said the broader economy could suffer if millions of people are deported. The Peterson Institute for International Economics wrote in September that if 1.3 million people are deported, GDP could fall 1.2% below baseline by 2028.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Immigration lawyers tell tech workers on visas to get back to the US before Trump takes office. 'A storm is coming.'\n\nImmigration attorney Sophie Alcorn is sharing this advice with her high-tech clientele: Get back to the US before President-elect Donald Trump takes office.\n\nThe new year brings Trump's return to Washington, and with it, immigration lawyers like Alcorn say they're fielding nonstop calls from tech worker clients to discuss policy changes that may take place under the second Trump administration. Alcorn said she's helping clients file petitions and extensions under current policies and is telling those with valid visas to consider returning to the country from temporary travel overseas before Trump takes office out of an abundance of caution.\n\nTrump swept to victory on promises to deport millions of immigrants in the country illegally, but he's offered few hints into how he will shape a legal immigration system that pipes highly educated foreign workers into tech jobs.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump signed a series of executive orders that limited access to many work visa types, impacting an important source of technical talent , according to conversations with four immigration attorneys.\n\nThey expect Trump to run some of those plays again. \"A storm is coming,\" said Jason Finkelman of Finkelman Law, \"and this time, we know exactly what it's going to bring.\"\n\nIn the first week of his first term, Trump signed an executive order restricting travel from seven countries with large Muslim populations, virtually blocking immigration from those nations. It also prevented professionals from traveling out of the country for work or personal reasons because they feared they would be unable to return.\n\nIn a September speech prior to the election, Trump said he would reinstate his \"famous travel ban\" and expand it to prevent refugees from Gaza from entering the country.\n\nThe last travel ban sparked outcries from tech firms that rely on foreigners with special expertise to fill their ranks and help shape their technologies. Hundreds of executives and employees such as Sam Altman and Sergey Brin converged on San Francisco International Airport in protest, while Box CEO Aaron Levie and the founders of Lyft pledged their support to the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed a lawsuit seeking to stop the order.\n\nThe travel ban faced a series of challenges in the lower courts and didn't take full effect until the Supreme Court upheld the order more than a year after Trump signed it.\n\n\"I think its possible that Trump may attempt to impose travel bans from certain countries just as he did when he initially tried to implement travel restrictions,\" said Jason Finkelman, who's based in Austin. \"While I think travel bans will likely face challenges in the courts it may lead to issues of US employers being restricted from hiring and retaining the foreign talent they need for their operations.\"\n\nElizabeth Goss, who runs her own law practice in Boston, and Justin Parsons, a partner at Erickson Immigration Group's office in Arlington, Virginia, said they believed a travel ban 2.0 would affect different countries this time around, based on this administration's priorities.\n\n\"The wildcard for me,\" said Parsons, \"is what happens to China.\" The president-elect has vowed to enact higher tariffs on Chinese goods , in an effort to hobble the world's second-largest economy. Parsons has asked himself if Trump would ban travel from China to further these efforts.\n\nThe tech sector is the biggest beneficiary of the H-1B visa , which allows employers to fill specialty roles with highly educated foreign workers. Last year, more than half of these visas went to workers in computer-related roles, according to data from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nDuring Trump's first term, government data shows that denial rates for new employees and requests for further evidence of eligibility surged. In 2020, the Trump administration temporarily paused the issuance of new green cards and many work visa types, arguing that this would protect American jobs during a pandemic decline in employment.\n\nThe Biden administration has moved to reverse some of these policies and facilitate the processing of work-related visas. In December, the White House published new regulations that allow the immigration agency to process applications more quickly for most individuals who had previously been approved for an H-1B visa.\n\nJason Finkelman said the new rules \"give predictability to employers and foreign nationals on the extensions of their visa petitions when there has been no change in the job duties or the employer.\" He added that it's plausible Trump can withdraw the regulations once he takes office, however.\n\nElizabeth Goss offered a more optimistic outlook. She suggested that if Elon Musk has Trump's ear, he might be able to persuade the president to leave the program untouched or even expand the number of visas issued, though such a move hasn't been made since President Bill Clinton raised the limit at the top of the dot-com bubble.\n\nHistorically, Canadians have had access to temporary work visa types, the L-1 and the TN, which allowed them to move across the border with less friction. However, according to Justin Parsons, they could face new headwinds under Trump.\n\nTech companies like Google, Microsoft, and Apple have relied heavily on the L-1 visa to transfer an executive or manager from one of their foreign offices to one of their domestic offices. Canadians have been able to apply for this visa at an international airport or border station without having to file a petition with the US Citizenship and Immigration Services, a far more cumbersome process.\n\nIn 2017, under the Trump administration, some border agents began refusing to process or renew work visas for Canadians already working in the country, Parsons said. The border agents would challenge their eligibility over what Parsons described as arbitrary reasons, or direct them to the immigration agency. This delayed workers who were traveling home from returning.\n\nAt the time, Parsons also observed Canadian clients on the TN visa - a temporary work visa for Canadians and Mexicans created under the North American Free Trade Agreement - come under increased scrutiny at the border.\n\nParsons expressed concern for Canadians that the probing measures might be reintroduced and potentially intensified under Trump's second term.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Here's where Biden and Trump stand on immigration in the 2024 race\n\nVery few issues animate Americans more than immigration.\n\nAnd under the presidencies of both Donald Trump and Joe Biden, divisions over the issue have only sharpened further.\n\nTrump's 2016 presidential campaign was defined by his hard-line views on immigration: arguing for a wall at the US-Mexico border and insisting that Mexico pay for said barrier, pushing for the deportations of millions of undocumented immigrants, and calling for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country.\n\nOnce in office, Trump sought to execute his broad vision. His administration constructed 455 miles of fencing along the southern border, but much of the wall simply replaced anti-vehicle barriers with taller steel bars. And despite Trump's rhetoric on ramping up deportations, the number of individuals who were removed from the US declined from October 2018 to September 2019.\n\nBiden in the 2020 election strongly denounced Trump's immigration policies, voicing his opposition to a border wall, blasting the GOP administration's family separation policy, and promising a more humane approach toward migrants at the southern border.\n\nBut since Biden took office, an explosion in border apprehensions - along with scores of migrants arriving in Democratic-led cities like Chicago and New York - has became a political liability, with voters giving him low marks on the issue.\n\nHere's a look at Biden and Trump's positions on immigration, one of the defining issues of the November election:\n\nImmigration has been one of the trickiest policy areas for Biden, as he came into office seeking to reverse many Trump-era policies but has instead often found himself on the defensive on the issue.\n\nRepublicans across the country have routinely excoriated Biden over border security since taking office, pointing their fingers at him over record levels of apprehensions at the border. In February, the GOP-controlled House of Representatives impeached Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas , contending that he had not enforced the country's immigration laws. (The Democratic-led Senate subsequently squashed the impeachment charges against Mayorkas.)\n\nTexas GOP Gov. Greg Abbott over the past two years has pushed back against what he said is Biden's lack of border security by sending hundreds of thousands of migrants to Chicago and New York. And it's created a difficult situation for Democratic officials like New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who has had to tackle budgetary challenges in housing migrants.\n\nBiden this year pushed for the passage of a Senate-crafted bipartisan bill, which would have overhauled the US asylum system, among other measures intended to strengthen security at the border. The bill seemingly put the president on the offensive on the issue, as he challenged congressional Republicans to back to proposal to get a handle on immigration.\n\nBut Senate Republicans overwhelmingly voted against the bill after Trump pressed them to tank it.\n\nBiden last week signed an executive order that restricts asylum protections - to the frustration of immigration advocates - for migrants if there are more than 2,500 unauthorized daily border crossings over a seven-day average.\n\nTrump has staked much of his 2024 campaign on Biden's vulnerabilities on immigration among voters.\n\nIn a New York Times/Siena College poll conducted in April, 50% of registered voters approved of Trump's handling of the issue while he was in office. Meanwhile, only 32% of registered voters approved of Biden's handling of immigration.\n\nThe former president was instrumental in tanking this year's bipartisan immigration bill , blasting it as a \"horrible open borders betrayal\" during a January rally in Las Vegas.\n\nTrump has made it clear that he intends to crack down on illegal immigration should he retake the White House.\n\nThe former president's conservative allies have already begun drafting executive orders and memos in preparation for potential early actions to restrict migration at the US-Mexico border, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nDuring Trump's sole term in the White House, he also made it more difficult for foreign-born workers - which included many highly-skilled scientists and engineers - to come to the US on visas. A second Trump administration could very well see a return to such policies.\n\nJump to"

He moved to end birthright citizenship, a constitutional guarantee. Trump also formally declared that illegal immigration is a federal emergency, part of any effort to involve US troops in border security.

      "text": "Elon Musk is clashing with Trump's MAGA base over skilled immigration. Here's what economics gurus are saying.\n\nElon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have clashed with Donald Trump's MAGA base on the subject of legal immigration , specifically the H-1B visa program for skilled workers.\n\nThe pair argued on X that the US must import foreign talent to remain globally competitive. In a now deleted post, Musk seemed to say there weren't enough smart Americans to fill the most demanding tech jobs. In a separate post, Ramaswamy blamed the shortfall on a culture in the US that has \"venerated mediocrity over excellence.\"\n\nIn contrast, many of Trump's followers believe employers are importing cheap labor, driving down wages and robbing locals of jobs. Under the banner of \"America First,\" they want to radically reduce legal immigration so that more Americans get well-paid jobs in areas such as technology and engineering.\n\nEconomics gurus are divided on the topic. Here's a roundup of their views.\n\n\"For the most part, immigrants are complements, not substitutes, for native-born workers,\" Krugman said in a Substack post .\n\n\"So original MAGA is wrong to claim that immigration is impoverishing 'real Americans' in general. But tech-bro MAGA is wrong as well as offensive in saying that we need foreign workers because Americans are stupid or lazy. Furthermore, the availability of less expensive foreign tech workers does reduce the incentive of tech firms to train a home-grown work force and undermines the political incentive to improve our education system.\n\n\"I'd still argue that something like H-1B makes America richer and stronger , especially given the spillovers generated by a successful technology sector. But Muskaswamy and friends aren't helping their case by insulting Americans' culture and intelligence.\"\n\n\"Allowing many more skilled workers into the United States reduces any incentives on American business to invest in the American workforce,\" Reich said on Substack .\n\nHe added: \"Allowing many more skilled workers into the US also reduces the bargaining power of skilled workers already in America - and thereby reduces any incentive operating on other Americans to gain the skills for such jobs.\n\n\"And opening America to skilled workers also reduces the incentive on foreign nations to educate and nurture their own skilled workforces. Why should they, when their own skilled workers can easily migrate to America?\n\n\"The major beneficiaries in the US of opening the nation to skilled workers from abroad are CEOs and venture capitalists like Musk and [ David Sacks ], whose profits and wealth would be even higher if they could siphon off cheaper skilled workers from abroad.\"\n\n\"How dare the US not kneecap itself and attract the best and brightest talent from around the world!\" Ederer replied to an X post expressing skepticism about expanding the H-1B visa program and ending caps on green cards by country.\n\nIn response to a comment arguing that more immigration could intensify competition for jobs, Ederer said: \"I'm a former H1B and now a US citizen. I'm an economics professor, a profession with a particularly large share of foreign workers. So this is literally what happens in my job.\"\n\n\"Legal immigration has contributed to American wealth as well as to our culture,\" Eisenach said on X. \"For example, Latino families are culturally conservative , educate their kids, create new businesses -- and make us ALL richer.\"\n\n\"The H1B program enhances America's workforce by bringing in - and generally keeping - very talented people,\" he added in another post. \"And, these are not people who are competing for middle class jobs.\"\n\nIn a third post, Eisenach argued that if the H-1B program was being abused to bring in nontechnical workers, that's \"obviously a problem that needs to be addressed.\"\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Americans aren't having enough kids. That's bad news for the economy - and immigration may be the answer.\n\nSome of the world's largest economies are grappling with a new problem for the first time.\n\nChina, Japan, and Italy are all battling dwindling birth rates - and their struggles are a reminder of an issue that could eventually become a problem for the US. The issue meant China last year lost its crown as the world's most populous country to India - a record it'd held for almost 75 years, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe Census Bureau predicts the number of Americans to peak in 2080, meaning that some of today's millennials and Gen Zeds might one day find themselves part of a shrinking population.\n\nEconomists say there are only two ways to stop that becoming a reality: either convince already-reluctant young Americans to have more kids, or keep immigration high.\n\nMillennials and Gen Zers are far more skeptical about starting a family than previous generations, with some pointing to a lack of financial stability and a potential climate crisis as factors.\n\nAs a result that's led to fertility rates plummeting. The average American woman is having just 1.6 children on average, per World Bank data - well below the figure of 2.1 that demographers say is needed to keep a population stable.\n\nWhile that might be good for the environment, it's a bad omen for the economy. The labor force is likely to shrink as the birth rate falls, while it becomes more expensive for the government to support an aging population.\n\n\"You basically just haven't got enough new people coming into the workforce, and you've also got an aging demographic,\" Marc Ostwald, chief economist for ADM Investor Services International, told Business Insider. \"That's where the equation lies - how quickly is a country replenishing its labor market, and how much of a burden are retirees?\"\n\nThe idea that low birth rates could threaten the economy has also taken off among tech bros, with figures including Tesla CEO Elon Musk frequently ringing the alarm about \" population collapse. \" Musk has also repeatedly signaled his support for pronatalism , a movement that calls for people to have more kids to supposedly save civilization.\n\nTwo other countries in the G7 - a group of the world's richest economies - have already felt the impact of population declines.\n\nJapan, which unexpectedly slipped into recession last week, is suffering from a well-publicized fertility crisis. Japanese women have an average of just 1.3 children, way below the number needed to maintain the population. Economists have warned the decline could trigger future labor market shortages.\n\nMeanwhile, economists have warned for years about plunging birth rates in Italy . Forecasters expect its population to plunge from 59 million to just 48 million by 2070 , despite the ruling far-right Brothers of Italy party's attempts to address the long-running crisis by making parenthood \"cool\" again .\n\nChina has also struggled to raise its birth rate. In 2023 its population fell for the second consecutive year after decades of rapid growth. That could weaken the power of its massive workforce, fuel declines in consumer spending, and put millions of teachers out of a job .\n\nThe US population isn't contracting yet - but low birth rates in other developed countries is a reminder of what may lie down the road.\n\nOne factor the world's largest economy has in its favor is immigration. By 2040, more Americans will die than be born each year, according to Congressional Budget Office projections. However, high immigration levels are expected to keep the population growing, albeit at a slower pace.\n\n\"The US population is still growing because of immigration, even at a time when that's the subject of heated debate ,\" said ADM's Ostwald. \"Japan, in comparison, has never tolerated a migrant population - and that's exacerbated its problems.\"\n\nHe added that the 2024 presidential election could be even more crucial for the economy. Republican frontrunner Donald Trump slammed Mexican immigrants in his 2016 campaign, and has recently tried to turn the border crisis into a political football to be used against his likely Democrat opponent Joe Biden.\n\n\"Trump's objective is to actually slow migration very dramatically into the US - and those sorts of views could dramatically change the dynamics of the economy,\" Ostwald said.\n\nCongress has also played up the potential for immigration to boost the economy over the longer term.\n\nImmigrants \"help counteract the slowing growth rate of the US population, which helps drive the expansion of the labor force and contributes to overall economic growth,\" the Joint Economic Committee, chaired by Democrat senator Martin Heinrich, said in December 2022.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Silicon Valley is on edge as Trump's immigration policy sparks fears of a high-tech talent shortage\n\nMany in the tech industry are concerned that President Donald Trump will make it harder to hire immigrants, sapping an important source of technical talent for the sector.\n\n\"If the backlash against immigrants impacts the flow of really talented people into the country, that's probably not good for us overall,\" said Michael Greeley, a general partner at Flare Capital Partners, a healthcare technology investor.\n\nTrump's election win could lead to mass deportations of unauthorized immigrants. Trump's campaign has also promised to complete the southern border wall and revive the \" famous travel ban,\" which restricted people from countries that were predominantly Muslim to enter the US. This order left many tech workers stranded outside the US in 2017.\n\nWhat's less understood is how the president-elect will shape a legal immigration system that pipes high-skilled workers from outside the US into coveted tech jobs.\n\nIt's difficult to estimate the number of immigrants legally working in the tech sector because there are several types of visas available to them. The H-1B visa program is the nation's largest temporary work visa program, with over 600,000 workers across 50,000 employers. Last year, 65% of approved visas went to workers in computer-related roles, according to data from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services.\n\nThe tech industry should get more clarity in the new year on H-1Bs, Hiba Mona Anver, a Silicon Valley-based immigration attorney who works with tech startups, said. In the meantime, she and other attorneys say they're getting on the phone with clients.\n\n\"I wouldn't go as far as to say that I'm sensing anxiety per se,\" Anver said, but there is \"a sense of the need to prepare.\"\n\n\"Trump doesn't have a great track record of supporting the visas that are critical to startup founders and early employees who want to build companies in the US,\" said Jenny Fielding, a cofounder and managing partner of Everywhere Ventures, a global investment firm.\n\nIn his first term, Trump fashioned himself as the \"Buy American, Hire American\" president. He signed an executive order suspending some temporary work visas, like the H-1B for skilled workers, a move that hit tech hardest . His administration oversaw an increase in visa-application denial rates and more requests for further proof of workers' eligibility.\n\n\"From 2016 to 2020, the average denial rate for H-1B visas was over 17%, compared to just 3.2% under President Biden,\" Sophie Alcorn,  a Palo Alto-based immigration attorney, said.\n\nWith stricter immigration laws, the tech industry could face a worker shortage like the one seen during the pandemic. Experts told Business Insider the sector is already understaffed , and recruiting workers with AI skills is particularly competitive.\n\nAnna Rathbun, the chief investment officer of CBIZ, a Cleveland-based financial advisory, previously told Business Insider, \"You shouldn't ban exports on chips and then completely export the talented labor. That makes no sense.\"\n\nAaron Levie, the chief executive of Box and one of Silicon Valley's senior statesmen, offered hope that Trump's ally Elon Musk could bring a fresh approach to the issue.\n\n\"Our high skilled immigration system is frozen in time and not responsive to the market,\" Levie posted on the social-media site X. \"We have far more demand for the top talent to work for and start companies here than we let in. It's a bipartisan issue that politicians don't touch. Someone like Elon finally could do it.\"\n\nMusk, a Trump supporter who may be considered for a role in the administration, replied, \"I agree.\"\n\nThe AI skills gap is so severe that tech firms are scouring university programs , enticing students with six-figure salaries and resources far beyond what academia can offer.\n\nIn podcast interviews over the years, Trump has also discussed the importance of attracting the best and brightest. He even suggested during an appearance on the tech-favorite podcast \"All-In\" in June that non-US students who graduate from US colleges should get green cards .\n\nThere could be reasons for optimism for the tech industry given newer figures in Trump's orbit, Alcorn said. Vice President-elect JD Vance has a background in venture capital , and Musk himself is an immigrant who's said he worked in the US on an H-1B visa.\n\nChris Farmer, the founder of SignalFire, an early-stage investor, said tech elites like Vance and Musk will have Trump's ear on setting a new standard for high-skilled immigration.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nOne visa holder told Business Insider she expects H-1Bs will become more difficult to obtain under Trump.\n\nShin Yi Chong, who received her H-1B visa in 2019, was recently laid off from her tech job as a product manager. After living in the US for roughly a decade, she said she now has weeks to find a new job or face deportation.\n\n\"Just seeing historical data from what happened when Trump was in office the last time,\" she said, \"I don't foresee it changing in a positive direction.\"\n\nShubhangi Goel and Riddhi Kanetkar contributed reporting.\n\nJump to"

Matt McClain/The Washington Post via Getty Images hide caption\n\nRead this story in Spanish.\n\nIn Santa Fe County, N.M., last month, local police leaders stood before a packed auditorium and showed photos of their uniforms so residents would know what they look like - and, more pointedly, what ICE does not.\n\n\"Whatever happens around the country, whoever is president, you are our community. We are your officers,\" Santa Fe Police Chief Paul Joye said with the help of a Spanish interpreter. \"It is a fundamental human right that you feel safe in your home regardless of where you're from.\"\n\nMeetings like this have been playing out nationwide in recent weeks. Police departments are holding town halls , releasing videos and statements , and adding FAQ sections to their websites. They're trying to communicate the same message: They are not immigration officers and residents should not be afraid to call them.\n\nIt's not uncommon for many people living in the U.S. without legal status to be wary of police. But as the Trump administration's immigration enforcement efforts have intensified, local police leaders say the fear many immigrants experience has also ramped up, and it's making their jobs harder.\n\n\"The one issue, honestly, that's keeping police chiefs up at night is dealing with immigration,\" says Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum. \"Dealing with their communities, dealing with federal law enforcement, they really find themselves caught in the middle and trying to navigate that ground as best they can.\"\n\nAt the Santa Fe meeting, Chief Joye, who dressed in plainclothes for fear his uniform might make people nervous, acknowledged his department's policy does allow them to work with federal immigration authorities in some instances.\n\n\"There are certain crimes for which we could work with ICE: concealing identity, identity theft, violent crime against another person, human trafficking, narcotics trafficking, gang-organized activity,\" he told the group, stressing that residents should still call the police when they are victims of crimes.\n\nIn a later call with NPR, Joye said he felt the meeting was productive.\n\n\"What I really wanted to let them know is, from our perspective, this is when we would or could get ICE involved. We don't participate in the sweeps. We aren't in a position to be adversarial to ICE or cause trouble for them either. We aren't working to aid them, but we aren't going to actively work against them either,\" Joye says.\n\nIt's a delicate message - and one that differs widely nationwide. There are around 18,000 law enforcement agencies across the country, and they vary in how they work with ICE, if they do at all.\n\nMany police want federal immigration authorities to detain people without legal status who have committed violent crimes or other felonies, but they don't want to scare away immigrants who are following the law - which they are more likely to do than citizens - from calling the police.\n\nBut the Trump administration is not targeting only people accused of committing crimes. It is also arresting students who protested Israel's assault on Gaza and people, lawyers say, who simply have tattoos of their favorite soccer team. That, along with the patchwork of local police policies, has helped sow fear.\n\nIn Tennessee, the Greeneville Police Department postponed a Hispanic community meeting this month after commenters on Facebook discouraged people from attending, claiming it was an ICE roundup in disguise.\n\nMany police chiefs have opted to risk the ire of the federal government in an attempt to preserve trust with immigrant communities - a bond that can be tenuous even in the best of times.\n\nIn Boston, when police commissioner Michael Cox pointed out last month that his agency doesn't have the authority to enforce immigration law, Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, said he'd \"bring hell\" to the city . On March 24, ICE arrested more than 300 people in Massachusetts.\n\nPolice leaders NPR spoke with say they're worried immigrants are already reporting fewer crimes. Studies show immigration status can be a barrier to calling the police.\n\nMinneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara says that jeopardizes public safety.\n\n\"If people are not willing to call us and tell us what's going on, tell us they've been victimized, cooperate as witnesses, all of that leads to a situation that makes the potential for everyone in this city to be victimized that much worse,\" he says. \"The effect of the climate over the last month has been that a lot of folks in different communities don't know the difference between my badge and an ICE badge.\"\n\nRepublican Sheriff Chad Bianco in Riverside County, Calif. says he is in favor of deporting \"criminals who are also here illegally,\" though he says he is largely prevented by California law from participating in those federal efforts.\n\nBut he regularly speaks with county farm owners. He says many of them employ people who are living in the country without legal status. Those workers, he says, are telling their bosses about crimes that they're victims of, including robberies and assaults.\n\n\"The owners are telling me, but they're telling me that they can't convince their workers to be a victim and to notify law enforcement because they're afraid they're going to be deported,\" he says.\n\nKieran Donahue, the sheriff in Canyon County, Idaho, says when someone is arrested and then found to be undocumented, he will hold them for immigration authorities.\n\n\"I have an obligation under the rule of law to notify federal authorities because they have broken federal law. And they wouldn't be in my jail if they haven't violated state law,\" Donahue says. \"We cannot, unless deputized, enforce federal law, but we enforce the rule of law. So it does put us in this position between these two factions, between the rock and the hard spot.\"\n\nDonahue, also president of the National Sheriffs' Association, acknowledged that holding ICE detainees could damage public trust in law enforcement, though he says he hasn't seen that in his own county. Elsewhere, though, \"There's been this spike of apprehension, nervousness, fear,\" he says. \"That is a steep hurdle that law enforcement is facing.\"\n\nHarold Medina, police chief in Albuquerque, N.M. and president of the Major Cities Chiefs Association, says trust between a community and law enforcement is what makes the difference in convincing people that local police are there to help them.\n\n\"It comes down to, you should never try to create a relationship with a segment of the community the day after something has occurred,\" he says. \"Every day we deposit in the bank of trust.\"\n\nHe says if law enforcement is only trying to build trust now, it's too little, too late.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

A lawyer explains\n\nBy\n\nObed Manuel\n\n,\n\nA Martínez\n\nThe director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Baltimore Field Office, Matt Elliston, listens during a briefing on Jan. 27 in Silver Spring, Maryland. Alex Brandon/AP hide caption\n\nA sense of anxiety is gripping many noncitizen residents of the United States.\n\nThe second Trump administration kicked off with a shock-and-awe effort aimed at arresting and deporting many immigrants without legal status . But across the country, stories are now emerging of both longtime legal permanent residents and visa holders being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and other immigration officers.\n\nThis week, Rumeysa Öztürk, a 30-year-old Turkish graduate student at Tufts University, was surrounded on the street by plainclothes immigration agents with covered faces and then detained. A nearby resident whose security camera captured the arrest said, \"It looked like a kidnapping,\" The Associated Press reports .\n\nÖztürk was lawfully in the U.S. under a student visa. She was then sent to a detention center in Louisiana. Last year, Öztürk co-authored an op-ed in the Tufts University student newspaper criticizing the school's response to the war in Gaza.\n\nAt a Thursday news conference, Secretary of State Marco Rubio - the son of Cuban immigrants - said his State Department is revoking student visas as part of its response to pro-Palestinian activism on college campuses.\n\n\"We gave you a visa to come and study and get a degree, not to become a social activist that tears up our university campuses,\" Rubio said, estimating that more than 300 visas had been revoked.\n\nRaha Wala, a lawyer and vice president of strategy and partnerships with the National Immigration Law Center (NILC), an advocacy organization, says that despite what feels like the Trump administration suppressing free speech, immigrants should know they have constitutionally guaranteed rights to due process in the United States.\n\nWala explained on Morning Edition some of the fundamental rights people have if detained by federal agents:\n\nWala says to remember the basics.\n\nIf someone is stopped by ICE or other law enforcement agents working on immigration enforcement, Wala says that everyone has the right to remain silent and advises remaining calm.\n\n\"You don't have to share anything about yourself, including your immigration status,\" Wala said. \"And they have an obligation to treat you with respect and due process under the law.\"\n\n\"Am I being detained?\"\n\nIn the case of Öztürk, Wala says that she could have walked away in the situation and sought shelter in a place clearly marked as private, something the NILC recommends in one of its know-your-rights fact sheets . But there are limits.\n\n\"Ultimately, at the end of the day, if they have a valid judicial arrest warrant, they do have the right to detain you,\" Wala said. \"But one question you can always ask is, 'Am I being detained?'\"\n\nWala says agents do have to answer whether they are lawfully detaining and bringing someone into custody.\n\nRules vary by immigration or legal status.\n\nDifferent rules do apply, Wala says, depending on whether someone is a U.S. citizen, a green-card holder, a visa holder or a person who doesn't have legal status.\n\n\"One thing the Supreme Court has been really clear about is that green-card holders, lawful permanent residents, have something akin to the rights of American citizens,\" Wala said. \"And we have seen this administration violating even those norms.\"\n\nBut Wala added that the \"most important thing to remember is that, no matter who you are or where you're born, what your immigration status is, you do have constitutional rights here in the United States.\"\n\nAre people at risk of detainment when reentering the U.S.?\n\nWala says that oftentimes at ports of entry, you do see diminished rights, adding that it's always important to be careful in those situations. Law enforcement officials can ask people about their immigration status at the border or at airports.\n\n\"But again, when you are in the United States, on U.S. soil, you still have fundamental rights to due process and the constitutional protections that are afforded to you for free speech,\" Wala said. \"And this administration seems to be throwing that entire idea of constitutional protection out the window.\"\n\nThis digital article was edited by Treye Green.

Joseph Prezioso/AFP/Getty Images hide caption\n\nTraveling or returning to the U.S. from abroad has become increasingly risky for some - even for people with valid visas and green cards.\n\nIn recent weeks, international tourists, visa holders and lawful permanent residents - also known as green-card holders - have been facing tougher scrutiny at airports and border crossings. The change comes amid a broader crackdown by the Trump administration to reduce both legal and illegal immigration to the country.\n\nAnd as spring break trips and summer vacations draw near, stories of green-card and visa holders being detained have sparked new concerns about traveling.\n\nEarlier this month, for example, Brown University urged its international staff and students to postpone any plans to travel outside the U.S. \"out of an abundance of caution.\" Canada, along with several countries in Europe, including Denmark, Ireland and Germany, have also updated their travel guidance for the U.S., urging their citizens to strictly adhere to U.S. entry rules or risk detention.\n\nIn a statement to NPR,  Hilton Beckham, assistant commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), said, \"Green card holders who have not broken any U.S. laws, committed application fraud, or failed to apply for a re-entry permit after a long period of travel have nothing to fear about entering and exiting the country.\"\n\nImmigration attorneys told NPR the riskiness of traveling abroad will be different for individual travelers, making it important for them to understand their rights and privileges before making travel plans.\n\nHere's what to know.\n\nThere are generally three kinds of travelers who enter the U.S., according to Stephanie Gee, senior director of U.S. legal services at the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP).\n\nU.S. citizens have guaranteed access to the country, Gee said. Green-card holders have procedural rights, meaning only an immigration judge can revoke their green card status. That means U.S. citizens and green-card holders can choose to not answer CBP officers' questions or let them search their electronic devices, though refusing to do so can result in a delay in entry.\n\nOn the other hand, travelers with a temporary visa, which is common among students and tourists, have the \"fewest rights,\" Gee said. CBP officers have the final say on whether these travelers can enter the country, and can simply deny entry if a visa holder refuses to answer officers' questions.\n\nStephen Yale-Loehr, a retired immigration law professor from Cornell Law School, recommends that green-card and visa holders double check their immigration documents before they fly.\n\n\"Make sure everything is in order, their visa hasn't expired or they don't have a renewal application pending,\" he said.\n\nThere are additional factors that could raise a traveler's risk level. Yale-Loehr pointed to a draft list of 43 countries that could be hit with a new travel ban, as reported by The New York Times earlier this month. (NPR has not independently confirmed the reporting.)\n\nThough there's not a list that's currently in effect, Yale-Loehr advised that travelers from the 11 countries in the proposed \"red\" category - places where travel to the U.S. would be banned outright - should think twice before flying here. These countries include Afghanistan, Bhutan, Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen.\n\nYale-Loehr added that typically, visa holders who are denied entry are simply put on the next plane back to their home country. But some people have recently been taken into custody and detained for days and weeks on end . \" It's a seemingly a growing problem,\" he said.\n\nFor green-card holders, factors like a long trip abroad can raise suspicion at the airport. Lately, some immigration attorneys have also been warning that green-card holders with a criminal record, no matter how minor, should avoid leaving the country.\n\nIn a recent case earlier this month, 34-year-old electrical engineer Fabian Schmidt, a green-card holder originally from Germany, was taken to immigration detention from Logan International Airport in Boston over a decade-old misdemeanor charge for marijuana possession.\n\nGee from IRAP said the best practice is for green-card and visa holders to consult an immigration attorney and get tailored advice on their personal situation.\n\n\"Even if this is not something you would've considered doing and you've traveled routinely before,\" she said. \"Just because its clear that immigration enforcement at airports is picking up in a way that it has not in the past.\"\n\nCBP officers can ask travelers to unlock their cell phones, give laptop passwords or hand over digital cameras. U.S. citizens and green-card holders can't be turned away simply because they refuse, but visa holders can, according to Yale-Loehr.\n\nHe said during an electronic search, CBP officers often look for material that would suggest non-citizens are ineligible to enter the U.S. That includes criminal convictions, domestic violence and support of terrorism.\n\n\" There's wide discretion at the border in terms of who to admit to the United States, even if you have a valid visa,\" Yale-Loehr said.\n\nIf a traveler's electronic device gets confiscated, the American Civil Liberties Union suggests asking for the officers' names, badge numbers and which agency they work for. It also advises that travelers should call the agency to request a receipt documenting that a personal item was taken away.\n\nAccording to the ACLU , travelers who are asked to undergo further inspection at the airport are not entitled to an attorney.\n\nYale-Loehr said it's still useful to have an immigration attorney's contact information on hand. He also suggests travelers to have a friend who can be quickly reached if there's trouble entering the U.S.\n\n\"So if it looks like you're going to be questioned by the border people, you can text a friend saying, 'I'm being pulled into secondary inspection, contact my immigration lawyer,' \" he said.\n\nGee from IRAP added that travelers can also ask for an interpreter if they need language assistance during inspections.\n\n\"That's really important actually because the questions you're being asked and your answers to them are really going to determine - a lot of times - the outcome of that situation,\" she said. \"So you should not be shy about saying, 'I don't understand. I need an interpreter.' If that's your situation.\"\n\nEven if authorities do not provide an interpreter, Gee said it's helpful to have the request on the record.\n\n\"There's generally going to be a transcript of the questions and answers in these types of interviews and inspections, and that is the kind of official record of what actually happens during this time,\" she said.\n\nNPR's Joel Rose contributed to this story.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Charly Triballeau/AFP via Getty Images hide caption\n\nThe Trump administration is taking the novel step of turning to other agencies to quickly bolster its immigration enforcement workforce as it prioritizes arrests and deportation.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is tapping other agencies and federal groups - from the U.S. Marshals Service to the IRS - to support Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to memos published by DHS and emails obtained by NPR.\n\nSarah Saldaña, former director for ICE under President Barack Obama, said it's common for law enforcement agencies to assist one another. For example, IRS or Drug Enforcement Administration agents might help with collecting evidence related to fraud or human and drug trafficking, she said.\n\nBut the new directives seem different, she said.\n\n\"What is unusual is to tap them as a general rule, to be available to presumably expand the reach of either the removal officers or the investigative agents,\" Saldaña said. \"That's unusual because they have their own missions and their own lanes.\"\n\nThe ICE workforce, some 20,800 people, is smaller than that of Customs and Border Protection and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and hasn't grown for decades, according to a 2024 year-end report .\n\nOfficials have long warned that staffing levels within the agencies that oversee immigration enforcement at DHS have been below what is needed, no matter which party is in the White House. ICE oversees domestic and international investigations through its Homeland Security Investigations department and deportations through its Enforcement and Removal Operations branch.\n\nNow, officers are facing more pressure. White House leadership has quickly grown frustrated with the pace of arrests . White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller told CNN that the agency has a daily goal of arresting at least 75 people per each of its 20 field offices - but would like to surpass that target.\n\n\"U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement recognizes the importance of its relationships with its law enforcement partners to carry out its mission in a way that best serves national security, public safety and border security,\" an ICE spokesperson said. \"ICE has always coordinated with federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies as part of its mission.\"\n\nBut employees across government are concerned that they might not be fully equipped to assist in the new mission, even as ICE officers face the pressure of steep arrest quotas.\n\nIn the first week of his second term, Trump officials issued a directive they considered \"essential to fulfilling President Trump's promise to carry out mass deportations.\"\n\nThe memo gave law enforcement officials in the U.S. Marshals Service, the DEA, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the Federal Bureau of Prisons authority to investigate and apprehend people suspected of being in the country without authorization. Most of those officials did not previously have duties that overlapped with ICE's removal mission.\n\n\"For decades, efforts to find and apprehend illegal aliens have not been given proper resources. This is a major step in fixing that problem,\" said then-acting DHS Secretary Benjamine Huffman said in a statement. The department has since highlighted the collaborations on social media .\n\nThe move came after U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem wrote to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent last month, requesting that \"qualified officials\" from the Internal Revenue Service's criminal investigations unit help with immigration enforcement tasks. That included assisting with investigating human smuggling, overseeing contracts, managing detention dockets, and physically escorting or supporting the transportation and removals of people in the U.S. without legal status.\n\nThe administration is also relying on immigration detention and support from the military, including at military bases around the country.\n\nSaldaña, the Obama-era official, said she can foresee pitfalls in bringing in others to assist with deporting those without legal status, for example, because other agencies don't know ICE's mission, and procedures.\n\nEddie Walker, president of the National Treasury Employees Union Chapter 247, agreed that it was a new policy for agents to help across the board with ICE efforts.\n\n\"It's certainly unorthodox,\" Walker said. \"I'm not sure how many people would leap to that job. It seems like a very different type of job.\"\n\nNoem later in February also signed memorandums deputizing up to 600 special agents within the State Department's Diplomatic Security Service across the country to help with arrests and deportations.\n\nICE appears to be trying to source workers from other agencies within DHS, too.\n\nAn email obtained by NPR shows that in early February, the USCIS Fraud Detection and National Security Directorate emailed some of their employees working remotely. Those workers, who are trained to investigate immigration-related fraud, were notified that their names had been \"put forward\" for consideration to serve on short-term ICE details and ICE task forces.\n\n\"We are reaching out to let you know that you may be contacted and that you are expected to confirm availability upon request of that communication,\" the USCIS email states.\n\nIt is not clear how many employees in total have been deputized to work for ICE from other agencies, and how effective their support has been.\n\nBut federal employees and Democratic lawmakers have protested some of the reassignments.\n\nFour Bureau of Prison facilities are currently holding about 700 immigration detainees, according to Kathleen Toomey, associate deputy director of the BOP. The use of federal prisons to house detainees was what Trump also relied on in his first term in office.\n\nA letter Democrats sent to Attorney General Pam Bondi raised alarm that the facilities may not be able to handle the shift in the prison population. A separate letter from Democrats sent to Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, included a statement from an anonymous BOP employee.\n\n\"We have not been trained or employed for this purpose, and we don't know what these individuals are being detained for,\" the employee wrote . \"BOP employees did not sign up for this. We have not been trained for this. We are not being paid for this. And it is not in our contracts.\"\n\nCongress is permitted to expand ICE's capacity and abilities by enlarging its budget, which could curtail the need for ICE to source workers from other agencies.\n\n\"Tom Homan said, 'I am begging you for money,'\" Senate Budget Committee Chair Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told reporters on Capitol Hill , also quoting the director of the Office of Management and Budget as saying that \"We can't rob other accounts any longer.'\"\n\nGraham said the request from the administration for an extra $175 billion would cover four years of immigration-related security enforcement.\n\nThe Senate passed a budget resolution last week with that figure, an early step in the reconciliation process , which would allow Republicans to pass much of Trump's legislative agenda with only GOP votes.\n\nBut first, congressional Republicans have to get on the same page. House Republicans passed a competing budget resolution on Tuesday. Reconciliation is only possible if both chambers ultimately get on board with the same resolution.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Joseph Prezioso/AFP via Getty Images hide caption\n\nTrump administration immigration officials are defending their move last week sending a doctor who was legally working in the U.S. back to Lebanon.\n\nAttorneys for the Department of Justice say Dr. Rasha Alawieh, a specialist in kidney transplants working on a H-1B visa, laid out their reasons in a brief viewed by a few reporters before the judge restricted access to the documents.\n\nIn a written statement, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for public affairs Tricia Mclaughlin pointed to what she characterized as Alawieh's support for the leader of Hezbollah, which is a U.S. designated terrorist group.\n\n\"Last month, Rasha Alawieh traveled to Beirut, Lebanon, to attend the funeral of Hassan Nasrallah- a brutal terrorist who led Hezbollah, responsible for killing hundreds of Americans over a four-decade terror spree,\" McLaughlin said. \"Alawieh openly admitted to this to CBP officers, as well as her support of Nasrallah. A visa is a privilege not a right-glorifying and supporting terrorists who kill Americans is grounds for visa issuance to be denied. This is commonsense security.\"\n\nThe judge was supposed to hold a hearing Monday morning on what he called \"serious\" allegations that immigration officials disobeyed his order that Alawieh not be moved without 48 hours prior notice.\n\nBut late Sunday night, Alawieh's lawyer - who had asked the judge to block officials from sending her back to Lebanon - asked to withdraw from the case, saying that \"as a result of further diligence, they no longer represent [Alawieh].\" Because the new lawyers need more time to get up to speed, and because Alawieh was already sent back to Lebanon, the judge cancelled the hearing.\n\nThe case, which coincides with news of a German-born green card-holder being detained, is raising concerns of an immigration crackdown in Boston.\n\nAlawieh was working at the Division of Kidney Disease & Hypertension at Brown Medicine, an affiliate of Brown University, on an H-1B visa, meant for highly specialized workers. She went to visit family in Lebanon in February. Upon returning to Boston's Logan International Airport, she was detained for 36 hours and had her phone taken from her, according to court documents filed by her cousin, who obtained the court order temporarily barring officials from sending Alawieh back.\n\nColleagues say Alawieh's lawyers made a frantic call to the airport control tower trying to stop her plane from taking off.\n\n\"We got the phone number for the control tower [...] on the internet,\" says George Bayliss, medical director of the transplant program. A lawyer called air traffic controllers imploring them to stop the plane, Bayliss says, but they were told they couldn't. Alawieh's lawyers accuse U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials of \"willfully\" disobeying the court order by sending her back to Lebanon.\n\n\"It was pretty dramatic and frustrating,\" says Bayliss.\n\nBut government lawyers explained in court papers filed Monday morning, that CBP officers at Logan did not receive notice of the court's order until after Alawieh \"had already departed the United States.\"\n\nIn the separate case of the German national, family members say 34-year-old electrical engineer Fabian Schmidt was detained for days when he tried to return to Logan Airport from a trip to Europe. They allege he was \"violently interrogated.\"\n\n\"He had to go and be stripped naked and was showered by two officers with ice cold water, and was interrogated again,\" his mother, Astrid Senior, told GBH reporter Sarah Betancourt. \"He hardly got anything to drink. And then he wasn't feeling very well and he collapsed.\"\n\nSchmidt was transported to a Boston hospital and later found out that he had influenza, according to his family.\n\n\"These claims are blatantly false with respect to CBP,\" Beckham said in a statement, without specifying which claims.\n\nBeckham went on to suggest the reason for his detention.\n\n\"When an individual is found with drug-related charges and tries to reenter the country, officers will take proper action,\" she said.\n\nSchmidt's family says he faced misdemeanor drug and DUI charges about a decade ago, and more recently, he didn't show up for a court hearing. Relatives say he never received the notice.\n\nThe cases are the latest instances of hard-line enforcement by immigration officials in the Trump administration. Trump's \"border czar,\" Tom Homan, has specifically called out Boston officials for vowing not to help federal immigration enforcement efforts.\n\n\"I'm coming to Boston, I'm bringing hell with me,\" he said to rousing applause at CPAC, the Conservative Political Action Conference, last month.\n\nAt the same time, opponents of the Trump administration's crackdown are mobilizing in protest. A rally is planned for Monday evening at the Rhode Island State House to support Alawieh, the doctor who was sent back to Lebanon.\n\nThat follows protests in multiple cities in support of Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student and pro-Palestinian protest leader who was arrested by federal immigration officers and faces possible deportation. They say his campus protest activities at Columbia amount to a national security threat, because they \"align with Hamas,\" a U.S.-designated terrorist group. Khalil has a green card and is a lawful permanent resident of the U.S.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "Catching up on the Trump administration's recent immigration developments\n\nBy\n\nXimena Bustillo\n\n,\n\nScott Detrow\n\nSCOTT DETROW, HOST: This past week, President Trump's administration took unprecedented actions in its effort to ramp up deportations. It sent more than 100 Venezuelan immigrants to a third country, El Salvador, where they were imprisoned - all of this without due process. And then the administration seemingly ignored a federal judge's order to stop those deportations, even if that meant turning the planes around midflight. This has all opened back up the major question of whether the Trump White House will follow the law and defer to courts - all of this, of course, on an issue that Trump campaigned on more than anything else. NPR's Ximena Bustillo has been tracking all of this and joins us now. Hey, Ximena. XIMENA BUSTILLO, BYLINE: Hey, Scott. DETROW: Look, Trump made so many promises on this front on the campaign trail. How is he seeing those through? BUSTILLO: He really focused on having a plan for a, quote, \"mass deportation effort.\" In his first two months in office, he has taken steps to see this through. Immigration and Customs Enforcement regional offices have daily arrest quotas to meet. Detention centers are maxed out, and this is according to DHS themselves. On the trail, he also promised to use things like the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to be able to deport people quickly. We saw this come through last weekend when he invoked the act and, as you mentioned, sent over 130 Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador. DETROW: And this act, the Alien Enemies Act, has become really important lately. Remind us what it is, why Trump says he's using it. BUSTILLO: It's a wartime power only used three other times. It allows the government to detain and deport those it suspects of being part of an enemy nation. And he's targeting those accused by the administration of being Tren de Aragua gang members. But recent legal filings from the government also acknowledged that many did not have criminal records in the U.S. DETROW: And this was the focus of those court hearings and rulings that got a lot of attention this past week and really raised these serious questions that the administration is ignoring the federal courts. What comes next on that front? BUSTILLO: Well, the government has until Tuesday to decide if it's invoking a special power that would allow them to not give the judge information on deportation flights used under the act. The judge wants this information to know if his orders to turn those planes around were ignored. DETROW: OK, so that's the stuff that got the most attention over the past week. What else is Trump trying to do to reach this big goal when it comes to these mass deportations he's promised? BUSTILLO: We're also seeing a push to remove protections from those who were given permission to be in the United States by the Biden administration. Most recently, the Department of Homeland Security said that it will revoke what's considered a parole program for half a million people who are Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans. This means that people who are currently eligible to work, go to school and be in the U.S. are set up for potential deportations in about a month. DETROW: So, Ximena, you were covering all of the stuff that Trump was promising as he ran for president. You're covering all the stuff that Trump is doing now that he is president. Have those goals changed at all? BUSTILLO: You know, so much of the president's rhetoric on the campaign trail focused on tackling crime in relation to immigration generally, and Trump officials have changed their messaging a bit on this front. Ahead of inauguration, the message was really focused on going after people who had committed violent crimes in the U.S. And since, they have pulled back to also say that they will arrest anyone without legal status. Earlier this month, immigration officers told reporters that they had made just over 32,000 arrests so far. But of those, more than half did not have criminal records in the U.S. There have been high-profile arrests of people being detained who are lawful permanent residents and on student visas and also reports of people who are married to U.S. citizens without criminal records having encounters with immigration officials, and even U.S. citizens have been questioned and arrested by immigration officials. But immigration advocates warn that the administration could be skirting due process throughout all this. Even in immigration court, you have the right to argue your case, to withhold or even cancel a final deportation order, and some people might be eligible for asylum or simply proving that they're not a member of a gang, according to immigrant rights groups. DETROW: What's been happening at the Department of Homeland Security as it tries to do all of these things it wants? BUSTILLO: Several members of law enforcement across other agencies, like the Justice Department or Treasury, have been tapped in to do immigration law enforcement work, and they're also taking part in a broader effort to reduce the size of the department by cutting people and positions they say are in the way of enforcement. Yesterday, staff at DHS, particularly within watchdog agencies, that do oversight on immigration detention and benefits processes were laid off. DETROW: OK, so what other challenges do they still face then? BUSTILLO: Well, border czar Tom Homan has said that they need more money, which can only come from Congress, to sustainably scale up. There just aren't enough people or space and not enough resources to do the big operation that Trump wants, even though we have seen these efforts scale up. Plus the administration is fighting several lawsuits, like those from immigrants rights groups pushing back against the use of the Alien Enemies Act and other arrests. DETROW: That is NPR's Ximena Bustillo covering all of this for us. Thanks so much. BUSTILLO: Thank you. Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement regional offices have daily arrest quotas to meet. Detention centers are maxed out, and this is according to DHS themselves. On the trail, he also promised to use things like the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to be able to deport people quickly. We saw this come through last weekend when he invoked the act and, as you mentioned, sent over 130 Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador. DETROW: And this act, the Alien Enemies Act, has become really important lately. Remind us what it is, why Trump says he's using it. BUSTILLO: It's a wartime power only used three other times. It allows the government to detain and deport those it suspects of being part of an enemy nation. And he's targeting those accused by the administration of being Tren de Aragua gang members. But recent legal filings from the government also acknowledged that many did not have criminal records in the U.S. DETROW: And this was the focus of those court hearings and rulings that got a lot of attention this past week and really raised these serious questions that the administration is ignoring the federal courts. What comes next on that front? BUSTILLO: Well, the government has until Tuesday to decide if it's invoking a special power that would allow them to not give the judge information on deportation flights used under the act. The judge wants this information to know if his orders to turn those planes around were ignored. DETROW: OK, so that's the stuff that got the most attention over the past week. What else is Trump trying to do to reach this big goal when it comes to these mass deportations he's promised? BUSTILLO: We're also seeing a push to remove protections from those who were given permission to be in the United States by the Biden administration. Most recently, the Department of Homeland Security said that it will revoke what's considered a parole program for half a million people who are Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans. This means that people who are currently eligible to work, go to school and be in the U.S. are set up for potential deportations in about a month. DETROW: So, Ximena, you were covering all of the stuff that Trump was promising as he ran for president. You're covering all the stuff that Trump is doing now that he is president. Have those goals changed at all? BUSTILLO: You know, so much of the president's rhetoric on the campaign trail focused on tackling crime in relation to immigration generally, and Trump officials have changed their messaging a bit on this front. Ahead of inauguration, the message was really focused on going after people who had committed violent crimes in the U.S. And since, they have pulled back to also say that they will arrest anyone without legal status. Earlier this month, immigration officers told reporters that they had made just over 32,000 arrests so far. But of those, more than half did not have criminal records in the U.S. There have been high-profile arrests of people being detained who are lawful permanent residents and on student visas and also reports of people who are married to U.S. citizens without criminal records having encounters with immigration officials, and even U.S. citizens have been questioned and arrested by immigration officials. But immigration advocates warn that the administration could be skirting due process throughout all this. Even in immigration court, you have the right to argue your case, to withhold or even cancel a final deportation order, and some people might be eligible for asylum or simply proving that they're not a member of a gang, according to immigrant rights groups. DETROW: What's been happening at the Department of Homeland Security as it tries to do all of these things it wants? BUSTILLO: Several members of law enforcement across other agencies, like the Justice Department or Treasury, have been tapped in to do immigration law enforcement work, and they're also taking part in a broader effort to reduce the size of the department by cutting people and positions they say are in the way of enforcement. Yesterday, staff at DHS, particularly within watchdog agencies, that do oversight on immigration detention and benefits processes were laid off. DETROW: OK, so what other challenges do they still face then? BUSTILLO: Well, border czar Tom Homan has said that they need more money, which can only come from Congress, to sustainably scale up. There just aren't enough people or space and not enough resources to do the big operation that Trump wants, even though we have seen these efforts scale up. Plus the administration is fighting several lawsuits, like those from immigrants rights groups pushing back against the use of the Alien Enemies Act and other arrests. DETROW: That is NPR's Ximena Bustillo covering all of this for us. Thanks so much. BUSTILLO: Thank you. Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Even in immigration court, you have the right to argue your case, to withhold or even cancel a final deportation order, and some people might be eligible for asylum or simply proving that they're not a member of a gang, according to immigrant rights groups. DETROW: What's been happening at the Department of Homeland Security as it tries to do all of these things it wants? BUSTILLO: Several members of law enforcement across other agencies, like the Justice Department or Treasury, have been tapped in to do immigration law enforcement work, and they're also taking part in a broader effort to reduce the size of the department by cutting people and positions they say are in the way of enforcement. Yesterday, staff at DHS, particularly within watchdog agencies, that do oversight on immigration detention and benefits processes were laid off. DETROW: OK, so what other challenges do they still face then? BUSTILLO: Well, border czar Tom Homan has said that they need more money, which can only come from Congress, to sustainably scale up. There just aren't enough people or space and not enough resources to do the big operation that Trump wants, even though we have seen these efforts scale up. Plus the administration is fighting several lawsuits, like those from immigrants rights groups pushing back against the use of the Alien Enemies Act and other arrests. DETROW: That is NPR's Ximena Bustillo covering all of this for us. Thanks so much. BUSTILLO: Thank you. Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nDETROW: And this act, the Alien Enemies Act, has become really important lately. Remind us what it is, why Trump says he's using it. BUSTILLO: It's a wartime power only used three other times. It allows the government to detain and deport those it suspects of being part of an enemy nation. And he's targeting those accused by the administration of being Tren de Aragua gang members. But recent legal filings from the government also acknowledged that many did not have criminal records in the U.S. DETROW: And this was the focus of those court hearings and rulings that got a lot of attention this past week and really raised these serious questions that the administration is ignoring the federal courts. What comes next on that front? BUSTILLO: Well, the government has until Tuesday to decide if it's invoking a special power that would allow them to not give the judge information on deportation flights used under the act. The judge wants this information to know if his orders to turn those planes around were ignored. DETROW: OK, so that's the stuff that got the most attention over the past week. What else is Trump trying to do to reach this big goal when it comes to these mass deportations he's promised? BUSTILLO: We're also seeing a push to remove protections from those who were given permission to be in the United States by the Biden administration. Most recently, the Department of Homeland Security said that it will revoke what's considered a parole program for half a million people who are Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans. This means that people who are currently eligible to work, go to school and be in the U.S. are set up for potential deportations in about a month. DETROW: So, Ximena, you were covering all of the stuff that Trump was promising as he ran for president. You're covering all the stuff that Trump is doing now that he is president. Have those goals changed at all? BUSTILLO: You know, so much of the president's rhetoric on the campaign trail focused on tackling crime in relation to immigration generally, and Trump officials have changed their messaging a bit on this front. Ahead of inauguration, the message was really focused on going after people who had committed violent crimes in the U.S. And since, they have pulled back to also say that they will arrest anyone without legal status. Earlier this month, immigration officers told reporters that they had made just over 32,000 arrests so far. But of those, more than half did not have criminal records in the U.S. There have been high-profile arrests of people being detained who are lawful permanent residents and on student visas and also reports of people who are married to U.S. citizens without criminal records having encounters with immigration officials, and even U.S. citizens have been questioned and arrested by immigration officials. But immigration advocates warn that the administration could be skirting due process throughout all this.

DETROW: OK, so what other challenges do they still face then? BUSTILLO: Well, border czar Tom Homan has said that they need more money, which can only come from Congress, to sustainably scale up. There just aren't enough people or space and not enough resources to do the big operation that Trump wants, even though we have seen these efforts scale up. Plus the administration is fighting several lawsuits, like those from immigrants rights groups pushing back against the use of the Alien Enemies Act and other arrests. DETROW: That is NPR's Ximena Bustillo covering all of this for us. Thanks so much. BUSTILLO: Thank you. Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nDETROW: OK, so that's the stuff that got the most attention over the past week. What else is Trump trying to do to reach this big goal when it comes to these mass deportations he's promised? BUSTILLO: We're also seeing a push to remove protections from those who were given permission to be in the United States by the Biden administration. Most recently, the Department of Homeland Security said that it will revoke what's considered a parole program for half a million people who are Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans. This means that people who are currently eligible to work, go to school and be in the U.S. are set up for potential deportations in about a month. DETROW: So, Ximena, you were covering all of the stuff that Trump was promising as he ran for president. You're covering all the stuff that Trump is doing now that he is president. Have those goals changed at all? BUSTILLO: You know, so much of the president's rhetoric on the campaign trail focused on tackling crime in relation to immigration generally, and Trump officials have changed their messaging a bit on this front. Ahead of inauguration, the message was really focused on going after people who had committed violent crimes in the U.S. And since, they have pulled back to also say that they will arrest anyone without legal status. Earlier this month, immigration officers told reporters that they had made just over 32,000 arrests so far. But of those, more than half did not have criminal records in the U.S. There have been high-profile arrests of people being detained who are lawful permanent residents and on student visas and also reports of people who are married to U.S. citizens without criminal records having encounters with immigration officials, and even U.S. citizens have been questioned and arrested by immigration officials. But immigration advocates warn that the administration could be skirting due process throughout all this. Even in immigration court, you have the right to argue your case, to withhold or even cancel a final deportation order, and some people might be eligible for asylum or simply proving that they're not a member of a gang, according to immigrant rights groups. DETROW: What's been happening at the Department of Homeland Security as it tries to do all of these things it wants?

BUSTILLO: Several members of law enforcement across other agencies, like the Justice Department or Treasury, have been tapped in to do immigration law enforcement work, and they're also taking part in a broader effort to reduce the size of the department by cutting people and positions they say are in the way of enforcement. Yesterday, staff at DHS, particularly within watchdog agencies, that do oversight on immigration detention and benefits processes were laid off. DETROW: OK, so what other challenges do they still face then? BUSTILLO: Well, border czar Tom Homan has said that they need more money, which can only come from Congress, to sustainably scale up. There just aren't enough people or space and not enough resources to do the big operation that Trump wants, even though we have seen these efforts scale up. Plus the administration is fighting several lawsuits, like those from immigrants rights groups pushing back against the use of the Alien Enemies Act and other arrests. DETROW: That is NPR's Ximena Bustillo covering all of this for us. Thanks so much. BUSTILLO: Thank you. Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Border officials might ask the purpose of your visit and how long you intend to stay before waving you through. But lately, officers have stepped up their questioning of travelers. Visitors with apparently minor visa violations have been shackled and chained and sent to U.S. detention centers. Michelle Hackman, who covers immigration for The Wall Street Journal, has been following these cases. She joins me now in the studio. Welcome. MICHELLE HACKMAN: Thanks for having me. RASCOE: So in your latest article, you mentioned border officials are using aggressive questioning tactics with visa holders and tourists. What are you seeing? HACKMAN: Yeah. So we're seeing a lot of cases, and it's tough, Ayesha, because the government, in many cases, is unwilling or unable to give us all the facts in the case, but what we're seeing is people with relatively minor visa issues. So, let's say they're on a tourist visa and they're house-sitting for someone. Another example - someone who is a fiancé of a U.S. citizen coming in on a tourist visa and border officials saying, wait a second, that's illegal. You should be on a fiancé visa. You know, in the past, border officials would say, OK, there's a problem with your visa. You need to fix it and come back to us. Now, people are being sent to detention centers. They're being deported over these really minor violations, and it's scary for people. RASCOE: Obviously, I'm not a lawyer and not privy to everything that ICE knows, but why not just deport someone who has problems with their visas immediately or just turn them around at the airport? Why shackle and chain them and keep them in ICE detention? HACKMAN: I think some of the issues around shackling and really aggressive questioning that we've seen is, in some sense, just rogue officers that have fewer checks higher up in the chain. The reasons that people are being detained for much longer - not entirely clear to me. But often, if you are going to be deported, it's something as simple as you need to buy a plane ticket, and the government doesn't just let you buy any plane ticket. You have to buy an open plane ticket, which means they can put you on any flight, and those can run, you know, six, seven, $8,000. People don't often have that money, and so they're being detained longer so they can collect the money just to buy their plane ticket home. RASCOE: You've reached out to U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials. What are they telling you? HACKMAN: Yeah, so they are pointing to President Trump's executive order that orders extreme vetting, and they're proud of this. They're saying, you know, we're enforcing the laws on the books, and we're catching attempted terrorists coming into the country. We're catching people who are breaking our laws. You know, this is something that they are proud of. RASCOE: One concern that people have had is border officials going through people's phones and looking for, you know, social media, stuff like that. Is that legal? Is it legal for border officials to go through people's phones? HACKMAN: In our laws and in our precedent, we, even as U.S. citizens, have very few rights at the border. You and I, coming back into the country, could have our phones searched, and that's even more the case for people who are not U.S. citizens. It's totally legal for agents to search people's phones, to search people's social media accounts. They're using AI tools to find things on people. So it's a much deeper level of searching than people are aware of. And I think people are being even more scrutinized than they were just a few years ago because of these really recent advances in AI technology. RASCOE: Can people be deported just based on their beliefs or, say, if they just don't like the current administration? Is that enough to get deported just based on that? HACKMAN: That's a really live question, and I think that's the one that we're going to be answering in the courts over the next few years. Obviously, there was a really famous case that's ongoing with this Columbia grad student Mahmoud Khalil, who participated in pro-Palestine protests and the government is alleging maybe did more than that, spread Hamas propaganda. And the government's rationale is that it is a foreign policy priority for them to remove him from the country, and on the face of the law, that's legal. You know, whether that law is legal, I think, is going to be the big question that we have to answer. There have been several other cases since where they're trying to apply that same law to other people. RASCOE: Travelers from Asia, Africa and South America have a much more difficult time entering the U.S. compared to Europeans. In India, the current wait time, just for an appointment for a tourist visa is more than a year. Most Europeans don't even need a visa to come to the U.S. for short stays. Is the focus on these European tourists being blown out of proportion, or... HACKMAN: I think you hear about it, again, because these are wealthier people who have more savvy about going to the media. You're right that people from - generally from poorer countries have a much harder time even getting tourist visas. The denial rate is really high. And so I think a lot of cases, people don't have access to the U.S. at all are being stopped sort of at that level, and so we don't even hear about it. RASCOE: People abroad may think twice before coming to the U.S. if they're hearing these sorts of news stories. What kind of impact could this crackdown have on the U.S. economy? HACKMAN: It could end up being significant. You know, right now, the industry that I've seen that has been the most alarmed, I would say, are universities, research institutions. The type of places that rely a lot on international exchange. They have foreign professors, foreign students, but it could have a much broader impact. You know, tourism is one of our main industries here in the U.S., but if people feel like they could face danger or long detention, it could deter some people from coming here. RASCOE: That's Michelle Hackman. She covers immigration for The Wall Street Journal. Thank you so much for coming in today. HACKMAN: Thank you. RASCOE: We contacted the U.S. Customs Border and Protection Agency to ask them about charges of aggressive vetting tactics. A CBP assistant commissioner told NPR in an email that the agency has always performed screenings and inspections. Lawful travelers have nothing to fear from these measures, he said, adding a visa is a privilege, not a right. (SOUNDBITE OF SAMBA TOURE'S \"ALBALA\") Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Border officials might ask the purpose of your visit and how long you intend to stay before waving you through. But lately, officers have stepped up their questioning of travelers. Visitors with apparently minor visa violations have been shackled and chained and sent to U.S. detention centers. Michelle Hackman, who covers immigration for The Wall Street Journal, has been following these cases. She joins me now in the studio. Welcome. MICHELLE HACKMAN: Thanks for having me. RASCOE: So in your latest article, you mentioned border officials are using aggressive questioning tactics with visa holders and tourists. What are you seeing? HACKMAN: Yeah. So we're seeing a lot of cases, and it's tough, Ayesha, because the government, in many cases, is unwilling or unable to give us all the facts in the case, but what we're seeing is people with relatively minor visa issues. So, let's say they're on a tourist visa and they're house-sitting for someone. Another example - someone who is a fiancé of a U.S. citizen coming in on a tourist visa and border officials saying, wait a second, that's illegal. You should be on a fiancé visa. You know, in the past, border officials would say, OK, there's a problem with your visa. You need to fix it and come back to us. Now, people are being sent to detention centers. They're being deported over these really minor violations, and it's scary for people. RASCOE: Obviously, I'm not a lawyer and not privy to everything that ICE knows, but why not just deport someone who has problems with their visas immediately or just turn them around at the airport? Why shackle and chain them and keep them in ICE detention? HACKMAN: I think some of the issues around shackling and really aggressive questioning that we've seen is, in some sense, just rogue officers that have fewer checks higher up in the chain. The reasons that people are being detained for much longer - not entirely clear to me. But often, if you are going to be deported, it's something as simple as you need to buy a plane ticket, and the government doesn't just let you buy any plane ticket. You have to buy an open plane ticket, which means they can put you on any flight, and those can run, you know, six, seven, $8,000. People don't often have that money, and so they're being detained longer so they can collect the money just to buy their plane ticket home. RASCOE: You've reached out to U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials. What are they telling you? HACKMAN: Yeah, so they are pointing to President Trump's executive order that orders extreme vetting, and they're proud of this. They're saying, you know, we're enforcing the laws on the books, and we're catching attempted terrorists coming into the country. We're catching people who are breaking our laws. You know, this is something that they are proud of. RASCOE: One concern that people have had is border officials going through people's phones and looking for, you know, social media, stuff like that. Is that legal? Is it legal for border officials to go through people's phones? HACKMAN: In our laws and in our precedent, we, even as U.S. citizens, have very few rights at the border. You and I, coming back into the country, could have our phones searched, and that's even more the case for people who are not U.S. citizens. It's totally legal for agents to search people's phones, to search people's social media accounts. They're using AI tools to find things on people. So it's a much deeper level of searching than people are aware of. And I think people are being even more scrutinized than they were just a few years ago because of these really recent advances in AI technology. RASCOE: Can people be deported just based on their beliefs or, say, if they just don't like the current administration? Is that enough to get deported just based on that? HACKMAN: That's a really live question, and I think that's the one that we're going to be answering in the courts over the next few years. Obviously, there was a really famous case that's ongoing with this Columbia grad student Mahmoud Khalil, who participated in pro-Palestine protests and the government is alleging maybe did more than that, spread Hamas propaganda. And the government's rationale is that it is a foreign policy priority for them to remove him from the country, and on the face of the law, that's legal. You know, whether that law is legal, I think, is going to be the big question that we have to answer. There have been several other cases since where they're trying to apply that same law to other people. RASCOE: Travelers from Asia, Africa and South America have a much more difficult time entering the U.S. compared to Europeans. In India, the current wait time, just for an appointment for a tourist visa is more than a year. Most Europeans don't even need a visa to come to the U.S. for short stays. Is the focus on these European tourists being blown out of proportion, or... HACKMAN: I think you hear about it, again, because these are wealthier people who have more savvy about going to the media. You're right that people from - generally from poorer countries have a much harder time even getting tourist visas. The denial rate is really high. And so I think a lot of cases, people don't have access to the U.S. at all are being stopped sort of at that level, and so we don't even hear about it. RASCOE: People abroad may think twice before coming to the U.S. if they're hearing these sorts of news stories. What kind of impact could this crackdown have on the U.S. economy? HACKMAN: It could end up being significant. You know, right now, the industry that I've seen that has been the most alarmed, I would say, are universities, research institutions. The type of places that rely a lot on international exchange. They have foreign professors, foreign students, but it could have a much broader impact. You know, tourism is one of our main industries here in the U.S., but if people feel like they could face danger or long detention, it could deter some people from coming here. RASCOE: That's Michelle Hackman. She covers immigration for The Wall Street Journal. Thank you so much for coming in today. HACKMAN: Thank you. RASCOE: We contacted the U.S. Customs Border and Protection Agency to ask them about charges of aggressive vetting tactics. A CBP assistant commissioner told NPR in an email that the agency has always performed screenings and inspections.

So we're seeing a lot of cases, and it's tough, Ayesha, because the government, in many cases, is unwilling or unable to give us all the facts in the case, but what we're seeing is people with relatively minor visa issues. So, let's say they're on a tourist visa and they're house-sitting for someone. Another example - someone who is a fiancé of a U.S. citizen coming in on a tourist visa and border officials saying, wait a second, that's illegal. You should be on a fiancé visa. You know, in the past, border officials would say, OK, there's a problem with your visa. You need to fix it and come back to us. Now, people are being sent to detention centers. They're being deported over these really minor violations, and it's scary for people. RASCOE: Obviously, I'm not a lawyer and not privy to everything that ICE knows, but why not just deport someone who has problems with their visas immediately or just turn them around at the airport? Why shackle and chain them and keep them in ICE detention? HACKMAN: I think some of the issues around shackling and really aggressive questioning that we've seen is, in some sense, just rogue officers that have fewer checks higher up in the chain. The reasons that people are being detained for much longer - not entirely clear to me. But often, if you are going to be deported, it's something as simple as you need to buy a plane ticket, and the government doesn't just let you buy any plane ticket. You have to buy an open plane ticket, which means they can put you on any flight, and those can run, you know, six, seven, $8,000. People don't often have that money, and so they're being detained longer so they can collect the money just to buy their plane ticket home. RASCOE: You've reached out to U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials. What are they telling you? HACKMAN: Yeah, so they are pointing to President Trump's executive order that orders extreme vetting, and they're proud of this. They're saying, you know, we're enforcing the laws on the books, and we're catching attempted terrorists coming into the country. We're catching people who are breaking our laws. You know, this is something that they are proud of. RASCOE: One concern that people have had is border officials going through people's phones and looking for, you know, social media, stuff like that. Is that legal? Is it legal for border officials to go through people's phones? HACKMAN: In our laws and in our precedent, we, even as U.S. citizens, have very few rights at the border. You and I, coming back into the country, could have our phones searched, and that's even more the case for people who are not U.S. citizens. It's totally legal for agents to search people's phones, to search people's social media accounts. They're using AI tools to find things on people. So it's a much deeper level of searching than people are aware of. And I think people are being even more scrutinized than they were just a few years ago because of these really recent advances in AI technology. RASCOE: Can people be deported just based on their beliefs or, say, if they just don't like the current administration? Is that enough to get deported just based on that? HACKMAN: That's a really live question, and I think that's the one that we're going to be answering in the courts over the next few years. Obviously, there was a really famous case that's ongoing with this Columbia grad student Mahmoud Khalil, who participated in pro-Palestine protests and the government is alleging maybe did more than that, spread Hamas propaganda. And the government's rationale is that it is a foreign policy priority for them to remove him from the country, and on the face of the law, that's legal. You know, whether that law is legal, I think, is going to be the big question that we have to answer. There have been several other cases since where they're trying to apply that same law to other people. RASCOE: Travelers from Asia, Africa and South America have a much more difficult time entering the U.S. compared to Europeans. In India, the current wait time, just for an appointment for a tourist visa is more than a year. Most Europeans don't even need a visa to come to the U.S. for short stays. Is the focus on these European tourists being blown out of proportion, or... HACKMAN: I think you hear about it, again, because these are wealthier people who have more savvy about going to the media. You're right that people from - generally from poorer countries have a much harder time even getting tourist visas. The denial rate is really high. And so I think a lot of cases, people don't have access to the U.S. at all are being stopped sort of at that level, and so we don't even hear about it. RASCOE: People abroad may think twice before coming to the U.S. if they're hearing these sorts of news stories. What kind of impact could this crackdown have on the U.S. economy? HACKMAN: It could end up being significant. You know, right now, the industry that I've seen that has been the most alarmed, I would say, are universities, research institutions. The type of places that rely a lot on international exchange. They have foreign professors, foreign students, but it could have a much broader impact. You know, tourism is one of our main industries here in the U.S., but if people feel like they could face danger or long detention, it could deter some people from coming here. RASCOE: That's Michelle Hackman. She covers immigration for The Wall Street Journal. Thank you so much for coming in today. HACKMAN: Thank you. RASCOE: We contacted the U.S. Customs Border and Protection Agency to ask them about charges of aggressive vetting tactics. A CBP assistant commissioner told NPR in an email that the agency has always performed screenings and inspections. Lawful travelers have nothing to fear from these measures, he said, adding a visa is a privilege, not a right. (SOUNDBITE OF SAMBA TOURE'S \"ALBALA\") Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

RASCOE: That's Michelle Hackman. She covers immigration for The Wall Street Journal. Thank you so much for coming in today. HACKMAN: Thank you. RASCOE: We contacted the U.S. Customs Border and Protection Agency to ask them about charges of aggressive vetting tactics. A CBP assistant commissioner told NPR in an email that the agency has always performed screenings and inspections. Lawful travelers have nothing to fear from these measures, he said, adding a visa is a privilege, not a right. (SOUNDBITE OF SAMBA TOURE'S \"ALBALA\") Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

The authoritative record of NPR's programming is the audio record.\n\nRASCOE: You've reached out to U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials. What are they telling you? HACKMAN: Yeah, so they are pointing to President Trump's executive order that orders extreme vetting, and they're proud of this. They're saying, you know, we're enforcing the laws on the books, and we're catching attempted terrorists coming into the country. We're catching people who are breaking our laws. You know, this is something that they are proud of. RASCOE: One concern that people have had is border officials going through people's phones and looking for, you know, social media, stuff like that. Is that legal? Is it legal for border officials to go through people's phones? HACKMAN: In our laws and in our precedent, we, even as U.S. citizens, have very few rights at the border. You and I, coming back into the country, could have our phones searched, and that's even more the case for people who are not U.S. citizens. It's totally legal for agents to search people's phones, to search people's social media accounts. They're using AI tools to find things on people. So it's a much deeper level of searching than people are aware of. And I think people are being even more scrutinized than they were just a few years ago because of these really recent advances in AI technology. RASCOE: Can people be deported just based on their beliefs or, say, if they just don't like the current administration? Is that enough to get deported just based on that? HACKMAN: That's a really live question, and I think that's the one that we're going to be answering in the courts over the next few years. Obviously, there was a really famous case that's ongoing with this Columbia grad student Mahmoud Khalil, who participated in pro-Palestine protests and the government is alleging maybe did more than that, spread Hamas propaganda. And the government's rationale is that it is a foreign policy priority for them to remove him from the country, and on the face of the law, that's legal. You know, whether that law is legal, I think, is going to be the big question that we have to answer. There have been several other cases since where they're trying to apply that same law to other people. RASCOE: Travelers from Asia, Africa and South America have a much more difficult time entering the U.S. compared to Europeans. In India, the current wait time, just for an appointment for a tourist visa is more than a year. Most Europeans don't even need a visa to come to the U.S. for short stays. Is the focus on these European tourists being blown out of proportion, or... HACKMAN: I think you hear about it, again, because these are wealthier people who have more savvy about going to the media. You're right that people from - generally from poorer countries have a much harder time even getting tourist visas. The denial rate is really high. And so I think a lot of cases, people don't have access to the U.S. at all are being stopped sort of at that level, and so we don't even hear about it. RASCOE: People abroad may think twice before coming to the U.S. if they're hearing these sorts of news stories. What kind of impact could this crackdown have on the U.S. economy? HACKMAN: It could end up being significant. You know, right now, the industry that I've seen that has been the most alarmed, I would say, are universities, research institutions. The type of places that rely a lot on international exchange. They have foreign professors, foreign students, but it could have a much broader impact. You know, tourism is one of our main industries here in the U.S., but if people feel like they could face danger or long detention, it could deter some people from coming here.

RASCOE: People abroad may think twice before coming to the U.S. if they're hearing these sorts of news stories. What kind of impact could this crackdown have on the U.S. economy? HACKMAN: It could end up being significant. You know, right now, the industry that I've seen that has been the most alarmed, I would say, are universities, research institutions. The type of places that rely a lot on international exchange. They have foreign professors, foreign students, but it could have a much broader impact. You know, tourism is one of our main industries here in the U.S., but if people feel like they could face danger or long detention, it could deter some people from coming here. RASCOE: That's Michelle Hackman. She covers immigration for The Wall Street Journal. Thank you so much for coming in today. HACKMAN: Thank you. RASCOE: We contacted the U.S. Customs Border and Protection Agency to ask them about charges of aggressive vetting tactics. A CBP assistant commissioner told NPR in an email that the agency has always performed screenings and inspections. Lawful travelers have nothing to fear from these measures, he said, adding a visa is a privilege, not a right. (SOUNDBITE OF SAMBA TOURE'S \"ALBALA\") Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Is that enough to get deported just based on that? HACKMAN: That's a really live question, and I think that's the one that we're going to be answering in the courts over the next few years. Obviously, there was a really famous case that's ongoing with this Columbia grad student Mahmoud Khalil, who participated in pro-Palestine protests and the government is alleging maybe did more than that, spread Hamas propaganda. And the government's rationale is that it is a foreign policy priority for them to remove him from the country, and on the face of the law, that's legal. You know, whether that law is legal, I think, is going to be the big question that we have to answer. There have been several other cases since where they're trying to apply that same law to other people. RASCOE: Travelers from Asia, Africa and South America have a much more difficult time entering the U.S. compared to Europeans. In India, the current wait time, just for an appointment for a tourist visa is more than a year. Most Europeans don't even need a visa to come to the U.S. for short stays. Is the focus on these European tourists being blown out of proportion, or... HACKMAN: I think you hear about it, again, because these are wealthier people who have more savvy about going to the media.

Lawful travelers have nothing to fear from these measures, he said, adding a visa is a privilege, not a right. (SOUNDBITE OF SAMBA TOURE'S \"ALBALA\") Copyright © 2025 NPR.  All rights reserved.

Tony Cavin, NPR's Managing Editor of Standards and Practices, talks us through some of this guidance.\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Immigration is always in the news. Late last week, President Biden extended temporary protected status for folks from Venezuela, El Salvador and Ukraine. And incoming President Trump has vowed to implement mass deportations, among other things. Just as the stories are ever-evolving, so, too, is the language we use to talk about them. NPR recently changed its guidance on how we reporters talk about this issue on our air and in pieces for our website. Tony Cavin is NPR's managing editor of standards and practices, and he is here now to walk us through some of the new guidance. Hi, Tony. TONY CAVIN, BYLINE: Hi, Mary Louise. KELLY: So I want to share with everybody the lead of the email that you sent to all staff - landed in my inbox this morning. It begins, quote, \"when referring to people who are in the United States without the government's permission, going forward, we should use the term people who are in the United States without legal status,\" end quote. Tony Cavin, what's the thinking here? CAVIN: Well, two things. I noticed that our own guidance was contradictory about the use of the term undocumented, both approving it and not approving it. I just think something didn't get updated, so I knew it was time to do something. And I also noticed that the Associated Press had stopped using undocumented as a description for people who are here without the government's permission. Many of the people do have documents. They don't just - they don't have the right documents. The trick here is finding language that is both clear, that doesn't dehumanize the people we're talking about and makes the point in as exact a way as possible, and we're not somehow coloring the debate by the language that we use. KELLY: I want to talk about one other term that has been used in our coverage. Plenty of news organizations have used in past illegal immigrants. And for people listening who may be scratching their heads and thinking, OK, but there are folks who come to the U.S. illegally, your note says, NPR journalists, we can use the term - can use the term illegal immigration, not illegal immigrants. The distinction being what? CAVIN: That people are not illegal. Someone can do something that's illegal, but they are not, in and of themselves, illegal. KELLY: OK. CAVIN: So we don't want to do that. KELLY: This is trying to center just basic humanity in our coverage of the people that... CAVIN: Exactly. KELLY: ...We're writing about? CAVIN: You know, I also mentioned in the same note that - but we try not to use terminology that talks about national phenomena - when we're in a flood of immigrants or waves of immigrants - just because you lose the humanity. Each one of these people who comes to this country, no matter whether they entered legally or illegal, there's a story behind it. There's an individual story. Our job is to try and get as close to those stories as possible. KELLY: That gets to a kind of golden rule of thumb in journalism, which is generally better to use a description than a label. Give us an example or two that come to mind here. CAVIN: Well, for example, we should say someone had crossed the border without permission or he stayed in the U.S. after his tourist visa expired. It really varies on the individual, but to the extent we can describe a situation, it's always better than labeling that situation, and as you note, that's not exclusive to immigration.

And for people listening who may be scratching their heads and thinking, OK, but there are folks who come to the U.S. illegally, your note says, NPR journalists, we can use the term - can use the term illegal immigration, not illegal immigrants. The distinction being what? CAVIN: That people are not illegal. Someone can do something that's illegal, but they are not, in and of themselves, illegal. KELLY: OK. CAVIN: So we don't want to do that. KELLY: This is trying to center just basic humanity in our coverage of the people that... CAVIN: Exactly. KELLY: ...We're writing about? CAVIN: You know, I also mentioned in the same note that - but we try not to use terminology that talks about national phenomena - when we're in a flood of immigrants or waves of immigrants - just because you lose the humanity. Each one of these people who comes to this country, no matter whether they entered legally or illegal, there's a story behind it. There's an individual story. Our job is to try and get as close to those stories as possible. KELLY: That gets to a kind of golden rule of thumb in journalism, which is generally better to use a description than a label. Give us an example or two that come to mind here. CAVIN: Well, for example, we should say someone had crossed the border without permission or he stayed in the U.S. after his tourist visa expired. It really varies on the individual, but to the extent we can describe a situation, it's always better than labeling that situation, and as you note, that's not exclusive to immigration.

      "text": "New poll details America's views on Trump's immigration plans: deportation, citizenship, border wall\n\nJoel Rose\n\nMembers of the U.S. Marine Corps patrol the U.S.-Mexico border area as seen from San Diego on Feb. 7. Carlos Moreno/NurPhoto via Getty Images hide caption\n\nAmericans are deeply divided when it comes to the details of President Trump's sweeping crackdown on immigration, according to a new NPR/Ipsos poll .\n\nThe poll shows growing approval for restrictions on immigration, like expanding the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. And a plurality of respondents say they support Trump's call for mass deportation of all immigrants living in the U.S. without legal status.\n\nBut at the same time, the White House's most dramatic moves - detaining migrants at Guantánamo Bay , Cuba, pushing to end birthright citizenship for all children born in the U.S. and allowing immigration authorities to make arrests in schools and churches - are broadly unpopular with Democrats and independents, even as they've been welcomed by most Republicans.\n\n\"Americans on the whole may be more supportive of immigration restrictions in theory,\" said Mallory Newall, a vice president at Ipsos, which conducted the poll for NPR. But in practice, she says, \"there's still not a lot of agreement about what that looks like.\"\n\nImmigration often ranks as a bigger concern for Republican voters than for others, and this poll is no exception: 47% of Republicans describe immigration as a top issue, compared with 19% of independents and only 9% of Democrats.\n\nOverall, 23% of poll respondents ranked immigration as a top-tier issue - a larger share than in previous polls but still lagging far behind the top concern, \"inflation and increasing costs,\" at 47%.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe president's supporters have largely welcomed his first steps to restrict illegal and legal immigration. In the Trump administration's first weeks, it has ramped up arrests of immigrants without legal status, suspended admissions of refugees and asylum-seekers at the southern border and rolled back legal protections for more than a million recent migrants from South and Central America.\n\nNearly 1 in 3 poll respondents said that recent restrictions on immigration \"go too far,\" while a similar proportion (29%) said the restrictions \"do not go far enough.\"\n\nFor the most part, Republicans stand united behind the White House's immigration agenda. Three out of 4 support denying federal funds to sanctuary cities that limit their cooperation with immigration authorities; nearly as many back using the U.S. military to arrest and detain immigrants without legal status.\n\nFour out of 5 Republicans support deporting all immigrants without legal status and characterize the record numbers of recent migrant encounters at the southern border as an invasion.\n\n\"So as far as I'm concerned, that was an invasion. It was not an armed invasion, certainly, but it was an invasion,\" said poll respondent Thomas Dunkelberger, a longtime Republican voter from western Michigan, in a follow-up interview. \"And that's got to stop. We can't afford it as a people.\"\n\nBut the poll shows that some Trump voters have doubts about his immigration policies.\n\n\"I think he's done a good job because we definitely do need to close the borders,\" said poll respondent Maria Rose Pawlyk in a follow-up interview.\n\nStill, Pawlyk worries that the White House is cutting off legal pathways for refugees and other immigrants who deserve humanitarian protections. And she does not support deporting all of the estimated 12 million immigrants living in the U.S. without legal status.\n\n\"There's no easy answer to it,\" said Pawlyk, who considers herself a political independent and says she voted for Trump. \"You can't just give a blanket statement of saying deport everyone, 'cause you can't.\"\n\nPerhaps none of Trump's executive actions has met with more opposition than his push to end birthright citizenship for the children of immigrants who don't have permanent legal status in the United States.\n\nAccording to this poll, less than a third of Americans support that proposal, which has been blocked for the moment by several federal judges.\n\n\"It just seems like a fundamental right,\" said poll respondent Morgan McGee, a Democratic voter from southwest Louisiana. \"If you are born here, regardless of where you came from, you should be a U.S. citizen. Like, that is just the end of it, you know?\"\n\nThe White House's push to detain immigrants without legal status at the U.S. naval station in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, is also unpopular. Only 36% of poll respondents approved, although the idea is much more popular with Republicans.\n\nLoading...\n\nThe poll also reveals some broader shifts in public opinion about immigration over time.\n\nWhen NPR and Ipsos began asking about building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border in 2018, only 38% of Americans supported the idea. That figure has gradually grown over time, to nearly half in our latest poll.\n\nAt the same time, support for DREAMers - immigrants who were brought to the U.S. illegally as children - has steadily declined. Seven years ago, nearly two-thirds of Americans favored giving them legal status. Now, that figure has declined to less than half for the first time.\n\n\"That, to me, is telling of the overall mood that the country is in right now,\" said Newall, of Ipsos.\n\n\"But many of these newer proposals being pushed by the administration are a bridge too far. Yes, they are supported by the Republican base. But they are not supported by the American public,\" she said.\n\nThe NPR/Ipsos poll was conducted from Feb. 7 to 10, 2025, with a sample of 1,013 adults online. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points for all respondents.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "Some Americans Have Already Been Caught in Trump's Immigration Dragnet. More Will Be.\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nAbout a week after President Donald Trump took office, Jonathan Guerrero was sitting at the Philadelphia car wash where he works when immigration agents burst in.\n\nThe agents didn't say why they were there and didn't show their badges, Guerrero recalled. So the 21-year-old didn't get a chance to explain that although his parents were from Mexico, he had been born right there in Philadelphia.\n\n\"They looked at me and made me put my hands up without letting me explain that I'm from here,\" Guerrero said.\n\nAn agent pointed his gun at Guerrero and handcuffed him. Then they brought in other car wash workers, including Guerrero's father, who is undocumented. When agents began checking IDs, they finally noticed that Guerrero was a citizen and quickly let him go.\n\n\"I said, 'Look, man, I don't know who these guys are and what they're doing,\" said Guerrero. \"With anything law-related, I just stay quiet.\"\n\nLess than two months into the new Trump administration, there has been a small but steady beat of reported cases like Guerrero's.\n\nIn Utah, agents pulled over and detained a 20-year-old American after he honked at them. In New Mexico, a member of the Mescalero Apache nation more than two hours from the border was questioned by agents who demanded to see their passport. Earlier this month, a Trump voter in Virginia was pulled over and handcuffed by gun-wielding immigration agents.\n\nIn Texas, a 10-year-old citizen recovering from brain cancer was detained at a Border Patrol checkpoint and eventually deported to Mexico with her undocumented parents and other citizen siblings in February. The family said it was rushing her to an emergency checkup in Houston when Border Patrol agents ignored a hospital letter that the family had used to go through checkpoints before. An agency spokesperson said the family's account was inaccurate but declined to provide specifics.\n\nIt's unclear exactly how many citizens have faced the Trump administration's dragnet so far. And while previous administrations have mistakenly held Americans too, there's no firm count of those incidents either.\n\nThe government does not release figures on citizens who have been held by immigration authorities. Neither Customs and Border Protection nor Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which handles interior immigration enforcement, would provide numbers to ProPublica on how many Americans have been mistakenly detained.\n\nExperts and advocates say that what is clear to them is that Trump's aggressive immigration policies - such as arrest quotas for enforcement agents - make it likely that more citizens will get caught up in immigration sweeps.\n\n\"It's really everyone - not just noncitizens or undocumented people - who are in danger of having their liberty violated in this kind of mass deportation machinery,\" said Cody Wofsy, the deputy director of the Immigrants' Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nAsked about reports of Americans getting caught up in administration's enforcement policies, an ICE spokesperson told ProPublica in a written statement that agents are allowed to ask for citizens' identification: \"Any US immigration officer has authority to question, without warrant, any alien or person believed to be an alien concerning his or her right to be, or to remain, in the United States.\" The agency did not respond to questions about specific cases.\n\nThe U.S. has gone through spasms of detaining and even deporting large numbers of citizens. In the 1930s and 1940s, federal and local authorities forcibly exiled an estimated 1 million Mexican Americans, including hundreds of thousands of American-born children.\n\nSpanning both Obama administrations, an NPR investigation found, immigration authorities asked local authorities to detain about 700 Americans . Meanwhile, a U.S. Government Accountability Office report found that immigration authorities asked to hold roughly 600 likely citizens during Trump's first term. The GAO also found that Trump actually deported about 70 likely citizens .\n\nThe GAO report did not get into any individual cases. But lawsuits brought against federal immigration agencies detail dozens of cases where plaintiffs received a settlement.\n\nWhen local deputies in Pierce County, Washington, arrested Carlos Rios on suspicion of drunken driving in 2019, not even the fact that he had his U.S. passport could convince the deputies - or the ICE agents who took him into federal custody - that he was a citizen.\n\nRios, who immigrated from Mexico in the 1980s and became a citizen in 2000, often carried his passport with him in case he picked up a welding job on a Coast Guard ship or a commercial fishing job that took him into international waters. But no one listened to him when Rios insisted repeatedly that he was a citizen and begged Pierce County jail officials and ICE officers to check his bag. Rios ended up being held for a week. ICE did not comment on the case.\n\nRios received a $125,000 settlement but is still haunted by his time in detention.\n\n\"I don't even have to close my eyes,\" Rios said. \"I remember every single second.\"\n\nThere are other, more recent instances too. This January, in the last days of President Joseph Biden's time in office, Border Patrol conducted raids in Kern County, California, more than four hours from the border.\n\nAmong those detained was Ernesto Campos, a U.S. citizen and owner of a Bakersfield landscaping company. Agents stopped Campos' truck and slashed his tires when he refused to hand over his keys.\n\nAt that point, Campos began recording on his phone and protested that he is a U.S. citizen.\n\nIn the video, agents said they were arresting Campos for \"alien smuggling.\" (His undocumented employee was in the truck with Campos.) Border Patrol told a local TV station that agents were also concerned about human trafficking.\n\nCampos has still not been charged. His lawyer said he was held for four hours.\n\nCampos' case is mentioned in a recent lawsuit by the ACLU of Southern California and the United Farm Workers contending that agents in the same operation detained and handcuffed a 56-year-old grandmother who is a legal permanent resident. The suit argues that Border Patrol agents \"went on a fishing expedition\" that profiled Latinos and farmworkers.\n\nAsked about Campos' case and the lawsuit, Customs and Border Protection said it does not comment on ongoing litigation.\n\nWhile there are a number of fixes the government could make to limit the wrongful detention of citizens, immigration authorities have often failed to follow through.\n\nAfter a series of lawsuits against the Obama administration, ICE began requiring officers to consult with supervisors before detaining someone who claims to be a citizen, and to not arrest someone if the evidence of citizenship \"outweighs evidence to the contrary.\" But the GAO report on mistaken detention of citizens noted that ICE wasn't actually training officers to follow the policy. (In response to the GAO report, ICE said it revised its training materials. It told ProPublica that agents are still following those policies for determining citizenship)\n\nCustoms and Border Protection and ICE are not even required to track how often they hold citizens on immigration charges, the GAO found. While ICE agents could note in their database if someone they've investigated turns out to be a citizen, the GAO found that they are not required to do so. As a result, records are often wrong and left uncorrected even after agents have been told of a mistake. Someone flagged incorrectly in an ICE database once may be forced to deal with questions about their citizenship for years.\n\nRead More\n\nPeter Sean Brown, another U.S. citizen born in Philadelphia, was mistaken more than 20 years ago for a Jamaican national living in the U.S. illegally. When he was later arrested in 2018 for a probation violation, immigration officials requested he be held, despite their own records documenting the case of mistaken identity, his lawyer said.\n\nBrown repeatedly insisted he was a citizen, a claim agents are supposed to immediately review.\n\n\"I'M TRYING TO OBTAIN INFORMATION CONCERNING A UNVALID ICE HOLD,\" Brown wrote to guards on April 19, 2018, while still detained at the Monroe County jail in Florida. \"IM A US CITIZEN...HOW IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE?\"\n\nICE eventually released him - after three weeks in detention.\n\nMarch 19, 2025: This story originally incorrectly referred to an agency that provided statements to ProPublica.

Sign up for The Brief Weekly to get up to speed on their essential coverage of Texas issues.\n\nPresident Donald Trump promised a radical reset on immigration, and he didn't waste any time getting started. Just hours after being sworn in on Jan. 20, he was seated in the Oval Office with a black permanent marker and a stack of leather-bound executive orders. By the end of Day 1, he'd revived many of the same programs and policies he'd previously carried out over four years during his first administration.\n\nThere were 10 orders related to immigration in all. And within them lay dozens of policy changes that, if implemented, would upend the immigration system and the lives of millions.\n\nThe blitz of executive order signing has continued, so fast and sweeping that it's been hard to keep up, much less gauge its potential future impact. Trump has paused the resettlement of tens of thousands of refugees who'd already been vetted and approved to relocate to the United States, including as many as 15,000 Afghans. He ended humanitarian parole for immigrants from Cuba, Haiti, Venezuela and Nicaragua leaving more than 500,000 already living here in legal limbo. He launched his promised effort to round up and remove millions of unauthorized immigrants starting with those accused of violent crimes, though less than half of the approximately 8,200 people arrested from Jan. 20 through Feb. 2 so far have criminal convictions, according to government data obtained by ProPublica and The Texas Tribune.\n\nTaken individually, many of the measures could be considered controversial, said Andrew Selee, president of the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute, but by the time experts get their mind around one new initiative, they learn there's been another. \"It's really hard for outside organizations, politicians or the public in general to focus on any one of them,\" he said.\n\nIn the meantime, some pushback has begun. Two federal judges swiftly blocked an order seeking to end birthright citizenship, calling it  unconstitutional, while about a dozen other lawsuits have been filed by civil rights groups, religious organizations and states. Advocates sued this week to reverse an order that declared migrants were invading the country and that authorized the president to use extraordinary powers to stop them. The White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn order to provide a glimpse of the enormity of the changes that are underway, ProPublica and the Tribune identified nearly three dozen of the most impactful policy changes set in motion by the orders signed on the first day. Most were pulled from the playbook of Trump's previous presidency. Others are unprecedented.\n\nSome of the measures in the executive orders revived policies from Trump's first administration, including\n            several blocked in court or rescinded following national outcry. Others are expansions of practices that\n            have been carried out by various administrations, both Republican and Democratic.\n\nInvokes special presidential powers that allow Trump, among other things,\n                            to circumvent Congress to unlock federal funding to build additional border\n                            barriers, as well as the deployment of the military as needed.\n\nTrump was the first president to declare a national emergency in relation to the border in 2019 to tap into funding to build border barriers after Congress stymied his efforts. The\n                            order was legally challenged, and President Joe Biden rescinded it upon taking office.\n\nSource\n\nTemporarily suspends refugee admissions into the United States.\n\nTrump initially paused the refugee resettlement program when he first took office in 2017. He then capped the number of refugees allowed into the\n                            country at 18,000,\n                            the lowest number in the more than 40-year history of the program.\n\nThousands of refugees who already had their travel booked saw their plans canceled. Trump\n                            also suspended federal funding to all groups who assist refugees already in the United\n                            States, including helping them with housing, finding work and other needs.\n\nSource\n\nSeeks to end the practice of releasing some immigrants from detention while they await\n                            immigration court proceedings.\n\nFor years, federal officials under Republicans and Democrats have released certain\n                            immigrants they can't detain,\n                            either because of capacity or health or humanitarian concerns. During his first term, Trump\n                            ordered an end to \"catch and release\" practices. But, as did his predecessors, the president had to release tens of thousands of family members and unaccompanied minors because of judges' rulings and laws that ban\n                            prolonged detentions for minors,\n                            as well as a lack of family detention space.\n\nA U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesperson said the agency is detaining everyone who\n                            crosses the border and holding them until they can be processed or transferred to\n                            Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nSource\n\nOrders most non-Mexican immigrants and asylum seekers to wait in Mexico as their cases go\n                            through the U.S. immigration court system.\n\nTrump first launched the policy known as the Migration\n                                Protection Protocols in 2019 to deter\n                            unauthorized crossings. Under the program, the administration returned about 70,000 people\n                            to Mexico. Biden sought to end the policy when he first took office, saying it was dangerous\n                            and inhumane. A federal judge ordered\n                                the Biden administration to restart it, resulting in\n                            around 15,000 more immigrants to be placed in the program until the judge's order was\n                            eventually overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security announced on Jan. 21 that it was immediately\n                                restarting\n                                the practice , but it's unclear how it would be applied since other Trump orders have\n                            suspended asylum at the border.\n\nSource\n\nAllows the U.S. government to reach agreements with other governments to send back\n                            immigrants to places other than their home countries where they can seek asylum.\n\nWhile Trump reached what they called Asylum Cooperative Agreements with El Salvador,\n                            Honduras and Guatemala during his first term, only the Guatemalan policy went into effect, with\n                                945 asylum seekers being transferred to the Central American country over a year.\n\nTrump's secretary\n                                of state, Marco Rubio , reached an agreement with El Salvador that would\n                            allow the U.S. to send deported immigrants from other countries to the Central American\n                            nation.\n\nSource\n\nRequires the DNA testing of some unauthorized immigrants and asylum seekers, in particular\n                            families.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump required that the Department of Homeland Security collect\n                                DNA\n                                samples from immigrant families, which was later expanded to include others in its\n                            custody.\n                            The Biden administration revoked the DNA testing contract in 2023.\n\nSource\n\nExpands the focus of arrests of immigrants beyond those who pose a security threat to\n                            include anyone who is in the country illegally.\n\nICE during the Biden administration was instructed to focus the\n                                arrests of immigrants on\n                            those in the country illegally who posed threats to the country, border security or public\n                            safety. Due to limited resources, agents could decline to take action when there were\n                            mitigating factors like age, health, military status, length of time in the country or\n                            pending humanitarian applications. Those priorities were challenged and ultimately\n                                upheld by\n                                the Supreme Court.\n\nOn Jan. 21, Acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Benjamine Huffman issued\n                                a\n                                directive rescinding ICE guidelines, in place since 2011, that required officers to\n                            get\n                            prior approval to conduct arrests at certain \"sensitive locations\" such as schools,\n                            hospitals and churches. Media reports have already detailed some ICE arrests near churches.\n                            A group of Quakers sued over the policy, saying it violates the First Amendment.\n\nSource\n\nCalls for the \"primary mission\" of the investigative arm of the Homeland Security Department\n                            to be enforcing laws related to illegal immigration, rather than its broad mandate to tackle\n                            human trafficking, drug smuggling, child sexual abuse and a host of other complex crimes.\n\nA\n                                2019 ProPublica investigation found that the Department of Homeland Security had\n                            shifted\n                            money away from more complex investigations to support Trump's push to arrest and deport\n                            unauthorized immigrants during his first term, including reassigning hundreds of agents\n                            to\n                            low-level enforcement tasks.\n\nSource\n\nExpands fast-track deportation proceedings for people who cannot prove they have been in the\n                            country for more than two years.\n\nIn 2019, Trump implemented a similar policy to expand\n                                the fast-track deportation\n                                proceedings , known as \"expedited removal.\" Before, the practice only applied to\n                            people\n                            apprehended within 100 miles of a land border who couldn't prove they had been in the United\n                            States for 14 days, as opposed to the broader time frame of two years. Immigrant advocates\n                            sued the previous Trump administration over the rule, but the case became moot after Biden\n                            reversed the policy.\n\nA Jan. 24 Federal\n                                Register notice put the policy into effect. The American Civil Liberties\n                            Union and other advocacy groups have already filed a lawsuit challenging the policy.\n\nSource\n\nPushes foreign governments to accept the deportation of their own nationals.\n\nFor years, the U.S. has kept track of \"recalcitrant countries,\" such as Venezuela and Cuba,\n                            whose governments have refused to take back their own nationals, hampering deportation\n                            efforts. Trump's first administration issued\n                                visa sanctions against Cambodia, Eritrea,\n                            Guinea and Sierra Leone for failing to accept deportees.\n\nIn a brief\n                                diplomatic blow-up , the president of Colombia refused to accept two U.S. military\n                            planes carrying deportees, citing concerns about the migrants' treatment. Trump responded by\n                            threatening to impose retaliatory tariffs and visa restrictions on officials and members of\n                            the president's family, and the U.S. Embassy in Bogota cancelled visa appointments. Colombia\n                            in turn promised to levy its own tariffs on U.S. imports but then backed down and agreed to\n                            accept the flights.\n\nSource\n\nEstablishes a hotline for people to inform the government about immigrants involved in\n                            crimes.\n\nThe order reestablished the Victims\n                                of Immigration Crime Engagement Office , which Trump\n                            created in his first administration.

Previous administrations have also pledged to hire\n                            more customs officers and border agents, but the agencies have struggled\n                                to find and retain qualified personnel.\n\nSource\n\nPledges to ensure that all migrants seeking entry into the United States \"are vetted and\n                            screened to the maximum degree possible.\"\n\nDuring Trump's first term, he also promised\n                                \"extreme vetting\" and early on began collecting\n                            social media handles from visa applicants and refugees, even though refugees have long been\n                            one of the most thoroughly vetted categories of people entering the country.

      "text": "Immigrants' Resentment Over New Arrivals Helped Boost Trump's Popularity With Latino Voters\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nAt first, she didn't think much about the Nicaraguan asylum-seekers who began moving into town a few years ago. Rosa was an immigrant too, one of the many undocumented Mexican immigrants who'd settled nearly 30 years ago in Whitewater, a small university town in southeast Wisconsin.\n\nSome of the Nicaraguans had found housing in Rosa's neighborhood, a trailer park at the edge of town. They sent their children to the same public schools. And they got jobs in the same factories and food-processing facilities that employed many of Rosa's friends and relatives.\n\nThen Rosa realized that many of the newcomers with ongoing asylum cases could apply for work permits and driver's licenses - state and federal privileges that are unavailable to undocumented immigrants. Rosa's feelings of indifference turned to frustration and resentment.\n\n\"It's not fair,\" said Rosa, who works as a janitor. \"Those of us who have been here for years get nothing.\"\n\nHer anger is largely directed at President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party for failing to produce meaningful reforms to the immigration system that could benefit people like her. In our reporting on the new effects of immigration , ProPublica interviewed dozens of long-established Latino immigrants and their U.S.-born relatives in cities like Denver and Chicago and in small towns along the Texas border. Over and over, they spoke of feeling resentment as they watched the government ease the transition of large numbers of asylum-seekers into the U.S. by giving them access to work permits and IDs, and in some cities spending millions of dollars to provide them with food and shelter.\n\nIt's one of the reasons so many Latino voters chose Donald Trump this election, giving him what appears to be Republicans' biggest win in a presidential race since exit polls began tracking this data. Latinos' increased support for Trump - who says he could use the military to execute his plans for mass deportations - defied conventional wisdom, disrupting long-held assumptions about loyalties to the Democratic Party. The shift could give Republicans reason to cater to Latinos to keep them in the party's fold.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump singled out Whitewater after the police chief wrote a letter to Biden asking for help responding to the needs of the new Nicaraguan arrivals. While some residents were put off by Trump's rhetoric about the city being destroyed by immigrants, it resonated with many of the longtime Mexican-immigrant residents we interviewed. They said they think the newcomers have unfairly received benefits that they never got when they arrived illegally decades ago - and that many still don't have today.\n\nAmong those residents is one of Rosa's friends and neighbors who asked to be identified by one of her surnames, Valadez, because she is undocumented and fears deportation. A single mother who cleans houses and buildings for a living, Valadez makes extra money on the side by driving immigrants who don't have cars to and from work and to run errands. It's a risky side hustle, though, because she's frequently been pulled over and ticketed by police for driving without a license, costing her thousands of dollars in fines.\n\nOne day two summers ago, one of her sons found a small purse at a carnival in town. Inside they found a Wisconsin driver's license, a work permit issued to a Nicaraguan woman and $300 in cash. Seeing the contents filled Valadez with bitterness. She asked her son to turn in the purse to the police but kept the $300. \"I have been here for 21 years,\" she said. \"I have five children who are U.S. citizens. And I can't get a work permit or a driver's license.\"\n\nWhen she told that story to Rosa one afternoon this spring, her friend nodded emphatically in approval. Rosa, like Valadez, couldn't vote. But two of Rosa's U.S.-born children could, and they cast ballots for Trump. One of Rosa's sons even drives a car with a bumper sticker that says \"Let's Go Brandon\" - a popular anti-Biden slogan.\n\nRosa said she is glad her children voted for Trump. She's not too worried about deportation, although she asked to be identified solely by her first name to reduce the risk. She believes Trump wants to deport criminals, not people like her who crossed the border undetected in the 1990s but haven't gotten in trouble with the law. \"They know who has been behaving well and who hasn't been,\" she said.\n\nIn the months leading up to the presidential election, numerous polls picked up on the kinds of frustrations felt by Rosa and her family. Those polls indicated that many voters considered immigration one of the most pressing challenges facing the country and that they were disappointed in the Biden administration's record.\n\nBiden had come into office in 2021 promising a more humane approach to immigration after four years of more restrictive policies during the first Trump administration. But record numbers of immigrants who were apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border began to overwhelm the system. While the Biden administration avoided talking about the border situation like a crisis, the way Trump and the GOP had, outspoken critics like Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott amplified the message that things at the border were out of control while he arranged to bus thousands of immigrants to Democrat-controlled big cities around the country. In Whitewater, hundreds of Nicaraguans arrived on their own to fill jobs in local factories, and many of them drove to work without licenses, putting a strain on the small local police department with only one Spanish-speaking officer.\n\nWhile the Biden administration kept a Trump expulsion policy in place for three years, it also created temporary parole programs and an app to allow asylum-seekers to make appointments to cross the border. The result was that hundreds of thousands more immigrants were allowed to come into the country and apply for work permits, but the efforts didn't assuage the administration's critics on the right or left. Meanwhile, moves to benefit undocumented workers who were already in the country were less publicized, said Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute.\n\nThe White House did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nConchita Cruz, a co-founder and co-executive director of the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, which serves a network of around 1 million asylum-seekers across the country, said that because of either court challenges or processing backlogs, Biden wasn't able to deliver on many of his promises to make it easier for immigrants who've lived in this country for years to regularize their status.\n\n\"Policies meant to help immigrants have not always materialized,\" she said.\n\nCruz said that while the administration extended the duration of work permits for some employment categories, backlogs have hampered the quick processing of those extensions. As of September, there were about 1.2 million pending work permit applications, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services data, with many pending for six months or more. USCIS said the agency has taken steps to reduce backlogs while processing a record number of applications.\n\nBiden's attempts to push for broad immigration reform in Congress, including a proposal his administration sent on his first day in office, went nowhere. Earlier this year, in an effort to prevent a political win for Biden before the election, Trump pressured Republicans to kill bipartisan legislation that would have increased border security.\n\nCamila Chávez, the executive director of the Dolores Huerta Foundation in Bakersfield, California, said Democrats failed to combat misinformation and turn out Latino voters. She recalled meeting one young Latina Trump supporter while she knocked on voters' doors with the foundation's sister political action organization. The woman told her she was concerned that the new immigrant arrivals were bringing crime and cartel activity - and potentially were a threat to her own family's safety.\n\n\"That's our charge as organizations, to make sure that we are in the community and educating folks on how government works and to not vote against our own self-interests. Which is what's happening now,\" said Chávez, who is the daughter of famed farmworker advocate Dolores Huerta and a niece of Cesar Chávez.\n\nTrump has made clear he intends to deliver on his deportation promises, though the details of how he'll do it and who will be most affected remain unclear. The last time Trump was elected, he moved quickly to issue an executive order that said no \" classes or categories \" of people who were in the country illegally could be exempt from enforcement. Tom Homan, who Trump has picked to serve as his \"border czar,\" said during a recent interview with Fox & Friends that immigrants who were deemed to be a threat to public safety or national security would be a priority under a new administration. But he said immigrants with outstanding deportation orders will also be possible targets and that there will be raids at workplaces with large numbers of undocumented workers.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMike Madrid, a Republican strategist, said it's wishful thinking to believe Trump will give any special treatment to undocumented immigrants who have been living and working in the U.S. for a long time. But he's heard that sentiment among Latino voters in focus groups.\n\n\"They believe that they are playing by the rules and that they will be rewarded for it,\" Madrid said. \"Republicans have never been serious about legal migration, let alone illegal migration. They're allowing themselves to believe that for no good reason.\"\n\nThe Republican Party's growing appeal to Latino voters was especially noticeable in places like Del Rio, a Texas border town. As ProPublica previously reported, Trump flipped the county where Del Rio sits from blue to red in 2020 and won it this year with 63% of the vote .\n\nSergio Garza Castillo, a Mexican immigrant who owns a gas station and convenience store in Del Rio, illustrates that political shift. Garza Castillo said he came to the U.S. legally as a teenager in the 1980s after his father, a U.S. citizen, petitioned and waited for more than a decade to bring his family across the border.\n\nEver since Garza Castillo became a U.S. citizen in 2000, he has tended to vote for Democrats, believing in their promise of immigration reform that could lead to more pathways to citizenship for long-established undocumented immigrants, including many of his friends and acquaintances.\n\nBut the Democrats \"promised and they never delivered,\" Garza Castillo said. \"They didn't normalize the status of the people who were already here, but instead they let in many migrants who didn't come in the correct way.\" He believes asylum-seekers should have to wait outside the country like he did.\n\nRead More\n\nHe said he began to turn away from the Democrats in September 2021, when nearly 20,000 mostly Haitian immigrants seeking asylum waded across the Rio Grande from Mexico and camped out under the city's international bridge near Garza Castillo's gas station. Federal authorities had instructed the immigrants to wait there to be processed; some remained there for weeks, sleeping under tarps and blankets with little access to water and food. Garza Castillo said he and other business owners lost money when the federal government shut down the international bridge, an economic engine for Del Rio.\n\nSome of the Haitian migrants were eventually deported; others were allowed into the U.S. to pursue asylum claims and given notices to appear in court in a backlogged immigration system that can take years to resolve a case. \"That to me is offensive for those who have been living here for more than 10 years and haven't been able to adjust their status,\" Garza Castillo said.\n\nHe hopes Trump seizes on the opportunity to expand support from Latino voters by creating a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who've been here for years. \"If he does that,\" he said, \"I think the Republican Party will be strong here for a long time.\"\n\nAnjeanette Damon , Nicole Foy , Perla Trevizo and Gerardo del Valle contributed reporting.\n\nFiled under -\n\nI report on immigration and labor, and I am based in Chicago.\n\nMica Rosenberg is an investigative reporter on ProPublica's national desk focusing on immigration.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

Sign up for Dispatches , a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive our stories in your inbox every week.\n\nA blender, still in its box, won at a grocery store raffle. Framed photos from a child's birthday party. A rabbit-hair felt sombrero and a pair of brown leather boots that cost more than half a week's pay.\n\nBox by box, the Nicaraguans who milk the cows and clean the pens on Wisconsin's dairy farms, who wash dishes at its restaurants and fill lines on its factory floors, are sending home their most prized possessions, bracing for the impact of President Donald Trump's mass deportations.\n\nIn the contents of the boxes is a portrait of a community under pressure. The Nicaraguans are as consumed as everyone else by the unfolding of Trump 2.0, wondering whether the bluster about deporting millions of people, most of whom live quiet lives far from the southern border, is going to mean anything in the Wisconsin towns where they've settled. For now, many are staying in their homes, behind drawn curtains, trying to be as inconspicuous as possible as they travel to and from work or pick up their kids from school. Few have given up on their lives in America, but they're realistic about what may be coming. Methodically, they have begun packing their most cherished belongings into boxes and barrels and shipping them to relatives back in Nicaragua, ahead of their own anticipated deportations.\n\n\"We don't have much, but what we do have is important,\" said Joaquín, the man with the love of western boots and sombreros. He's 35 years old and has worked over the last three years as a cook at the restaurant below his apartment. \"We have worked so hard and sacrificed so much in order to acquire these things,\" he added.\n\nThe packing is happening all across Wisconsin, a state that in recent years has become a top destination for Nicaraguans who say they are fleeing poverty and government repression. And it is happening among immigrants of varying legal statuses. There are the undocumented dairy workers who came more than a decade ago and were the first from their rural communities to settle in Wisconsin. And there are the more recent arrivals, including asylum-seekers who have permission to live and work in the U.S. as they await their day in immigration court.\n\nNobody feels safe from Trump and his promises; in just his first week back in office, the president moved to end birthright citizenship, sent hundreds of military troops to the southern border and launched a flashy, multi-agency operation to find and detain immigrants in Chicago, only a few hundred miles away.\n\nYesenia Meza, a community health worker in central Wisconsin, began hearing from families soon after Trump's election; they wanted help obtaining the documents they might need if they have to suddenly leave the country with their U.S.-born children, or have those children sent to them if they are deported. When she visited their apartments, Meza said, she was stunned to discover they had spent hundreds of dollars on refrigerator-sized boxes and blue plastic barrels that they'd stuffed with nearly  \"everything that they own, their most precious belongings\" and were shipping to their home country.\n\nAt one home, she watched an immigrant mother climb into a half-packed box and announce, \"I'm going to mail myself.\" Meza knew she was joking. But some of the immigrants she knew had already left. And if more people go, she wonders what impact their departures - whether voluntary or forced - will have on the local economy. Immigrants in the area work on farms, in cheese-processing factories and in a chicken plant - the kind of jobs, she said, that nobody else wants. She's talked to some of the employers before and knows \"they're always short-staffed,\" Meza said. \"They're going to be more short-staffed now when people start going back home.\"\n\nLast week, on the eve of Trump's inauguration, I traveled to Wisconsin along with photographer Benjamin Rasmussen to capture what sounded like the beginning of a community coming undone. We talked to Nicaraguans in their kitchens and bedrooms, and in restaurants and grocery stores that have sprung up to cater to them. Many of the people we met either were packing themselves or knew someone else who was, or both.\n\nSome were almost embarrassed to show us what they were packing - items that might have been considered frivolous or extravagant back home. Nicaragua was already one of the poorest countries in the hemisphere before its government took a turn toward authoritarianism and repression, further sinking the economy. But thanks to their working-class jobs at American factories and restaurants, they could afford these things, and they were determined to hold on to them. Some of their belongings carried memories of loved ones or of special occasions. Other items were more practical, tools that might help them get started again in Nicaragua.\n\nFrom the stories these immigrants told about their belongings emerged others, stories about what had brought them to this country and what they have been able to achieve here. They spoke about the panic that now traps them in their homes and keeps them up at night. And they shared their hopes and fears about what it might mean to start over in a country they fled.\n\nYaceth's guilty pleasure is shoes. The 38-year-old left Nicaragua nearly three years ago and works in the same restaurant kitchen as Joaquín. Her wages allowed her to buy a pair or so a month on Amazon, mostly Keds lace-up sneakers, though she also owns glittery stilettos and knee-high red boots. The boxes fill the top half of her closet. Some pairs have never been worn.\n\nWe stood along the edge of her bed, admiring her collection. \"I'm a bit of an aficionado,\" she said sheepishly. Like the other immigrants we spoke with, Yaceth asked not to be identified by her full name to lessen the risk of deportation.\n\nYaceth said she stopped buying shoes after Trump's election, uncertain how her life, not to mention her finances, might change once he took office. By the time we met, she had already packed one box of belongings and sent it to her mother in Estelí, a city in northwestern Nicaragua. In the corner of her already crowded bedroom, she kept a blue plastic barrel, which is where she'd planned to put the shoes, hoping it would keep them dry and undamaged during the shipping. If she goes, they're going, too.\n\nShe rents a room in the apartment of another family. They, too, are thinking about what it might look like to return to Nicaragua. Hugo, 33, is setting aside items that might help him make a living back in his hometown of Somoto, about an hour and a half north of Estelí. This includes a Cuisinart digital air fryer he bought with his wages from a sheet-metal factory. Hugo used to sell hot dogs and hamburgers at a fast food stand in Somoto. If he has to return, he envisions starting another food business. The air fryer would help.\n\n\"Everything that Trump says is against us. It makes you feel terrible.\"\n\nWe visited a new Nicaraguan restaurant in Waunakee, a village in Dane County that's seen significant numbers of Nicaraguan arrivals in recent years. One diner, a 49-year-old undocumented dairy worker, told me he plans to send barber trimmers and other supplies for the barbershop he'd like to open up if he's deported. As we spoke, his dinner companion called a friend who lives a few towns away and handed me the phone; that man, also a dairy worker, told me he is sending back power tools he bought on Facebook Marketplace that are expensive and difficult to find in Nicaragua.\n\nOther immigrants expressed deep uncertainty about whether they might face jail time or worse if they are deported, due to their previous involvement in political activities against the Nicaraguan government. If you don't toe the party line, said Uriel, a former high school teacher, \"they turn you into an enemy of the state.\"\n\nUriel, 36, said he never participated in any anti-government marches. But he worried that local party leaders had been watching him, that they knew how he spoke about democracy and free speech in the classroom.\n\nHe said he left Nicaragua almost four years ago both because of the political situation and because he knew he could make more money in the U.S. He has an ongoing asylum case, a work permit and a job at a bread factory. His wages have allowed him to buy a plot of land for his wife and two children, still in Nicaragua, and begin construction on a house there.\n\nHe'd hoped to stay in Wisconsin long enough to pay to finish it. But bracing for the inevitable, he's got a barrel too. Soon, he plans to pack and send a used Yamaha guitar he was given as a gift a few years earlier. Uriel learned to play the instrument by watching YouTube videos and now plays Christian hymns that he said make him feel good inside.\n\nThis summer, he plans to return as well. His children have been growing up without him. He has been told his 6-year-old daughter points to planes in the sky and wonders whether her father is inside. He worries that his son, 11, will grow up believing he has been abandoned.\n\nIt has been hard to be separated from his children, he said. But he left in order to provide them a life he didn't believe he could have if he had stayed - a reality he thought was missing from so much of the new president's rhetoric on immigration. \"We are not anybody's enemy,\" Uriel said. \"We simply are looking for a way to make a living, to help our families.\"\n\n\"What we're afraid of is getting picked up on the street and then not having a chance to send home all of the things that cost us so much.\"\n\nIt used to be that on Sundays, his day off, Joaquín would pull on his favorite boots and sombrero to drive somewhere - to a restaurant or to visit family and friends who had settled in south-central Wisconsin. But ever since Trump's election, he doesn't leave his apartment unless he has to. Some days, he says, he feels like a mouse, scurrying downstairs to work and upstairs to sleep and back downstairs again to work, always alert and full of dread.\n\nThe gray 2016 Toyota 4Runner that he bought last year, his pride and joy, sits mostly unused behind his apartment building. He's too afraid of driving and getting pulled over by police officers who, by randomly checking his vehicle's plates, could discover he doesn't have a driver's license. Joaquín doesn't have the documents he needs to qualify for one. He worries that drawing the attention of police, even for the smallest of infractions, could get him swept into the immigration detention system and deported. \"What's happening now is a persecution,\" he said.\n\nOn a recent Sunday, his apartment was filled with the sweet, warm smell of home-baked goods. Joaquín said he spent two hours making traditional Nicaraguan cookies called rosquillas and hojaldras, one savory and the other sweet. We talked over coffee and the cornmeal cookies. Half of his living room floor was covered with piles of clothes and shoes, and one tall, empty box. There were shirts, pants and sneakers for each of his three children, who remain in Nicaragua. Most of the clothes belonged to Joaquín: a crisp pair of tan Lee jeans, rarely worn; several pairs of boots; a box of sombreros.\n\nJoaquín said he plans to send all of it to relatives in Nicaragua in February. It pains him to imagine being trotted onto a deportation flight and leaving everything he owns here to get tossed in a landfill somewhere.\n\nAnother day, I spoke by phone with an immigrant named Luz, 26. Like Joaquín, she said she rarely leaves her apartment anymore. The week Trump was inaugurated, she stopped going to her job at a nearby cheese factory, afraid of workplace raids. She now stays home with their 1-year-old son. A woman she knows picks up the family's groceries so they don't have to risk being out on the street.\n\nLike many of her friends and relatives, Luz came to the U.S. as an asylum-seeker almost three years ago. She missed an immigration court hearing while pregnant with her son and now worries she has \"no legal status here.\"\n\n\"Those of us who work milking cows, we can't afford to hire a lawyer,\" she said. \"We don't even know what's happening with our cases.\"\n\nAfter Trump's election, she began packing some of the things she'd accumulated in her time in Wisconsin, including some used children's clothes she'd received from Meza, the community health worker. She packed most everything in her kitchen: most of her pots and pans, some plates and cups, knives, an iron and \"even chocolates,\" she said, almost laughing. \"It is a big box.\"\n\nLuz said she wants all of her household items to be in Nicaragua when she returns with her family. They hope to leave in March. \"I don't want to live in hiding like this,\" she said.\n\n\"My biggest fear is that they deport me and take my son away.\"\n\nIsabel's son cried as she filled her box. In went the shiny red car, big enough for the 14-month-old to sit in and drive. It had been a gift from his godfather on his first birthday. She added other, smaller cars and planes and stuffed animals. A stroller. A framed photo from the birthday party, the chubby-cheeked boy surrounded by balloons.\n\nThe 26-year-old mother knew her son was too young to understand. But she hoped he would if the dreaded time came when they had to return to Nicaragua.\n\nAnd to make sure she wouldn't be separated from him, she applied for his passport early last fall, when she became convinced that Trump would win the election. She could see his lawn signs all around her in the rural community in the middle of the state where she lives. Her husband, who works on a dairy farm, told her he'd begun feeling uncomfortable with the way people glared at him at Walmart. Sometimes, they shouted things he didn't understand, but in a tone that was unmistakably hostile.\n\nTheir son was born in the U.S. to noncitizen parents - exactly the kind of child Trump says does not deserve citizenship here. Isabel got his passport both to secure his rights as an American citizen and to secure her rights to him. She wants to make sure there is no mistaking who the boy belongs to if she gets sent away.\n\nRead More\n\nWe met Isabel about a week after she'd shipped off the box with her son's red toy car to her mother's home in southern Nicaragua. It was the morning of Trump's inauguration, and Isabel welcomed us into her apartment, her eyes still red and bleary from an overnight shift at a nearby cheese-processing factory.\n\nShe said they were ready to go \"if things get ugly\" and the people around her start getting picked up and sent back. But there was another box, still flat and unpacked, propped up against a wall in the living room. That one, she explained, belonged to a neighbor with the same game plan.\n\nI ask her what happens if they don't get deported, but their most precious belongings are gone. Won't they miss those things? \"Yes,\" she said. But it would be even worse to go back to Nicaragua and have nothing.\n\nAdditional design and development by Zisiga Mukulu\n\nFiled under -\n\nI report on immigration and labor, and I am based in Chicago.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "The U.S. Business Community Used to Be a Force for Immigration Reform. What Happened?\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nThese highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.\n\nIn 1996, a familiar Republican candidate ran for president calling himself an \"America-first\" populist, riling up his supporters by claiming that immigrants were \"invading\" our country.\n\n\"I'll build that security fence, and we'll close it, and we'll say, 'Listen, José, you're not coming in this time!'\" shouted the candidate, Pat Buchanan, to raucous applause at an Iowa rally early that year.\n\nAnti-immigrant sentiment was simmering across the nation, and it was about to translate into federal policy. Leading congressional Republicans, channeling Buchanan's ideas, were drafting the most restrictionist immigration legislation in nearly a century. The bill included not just a crackdown on undocumented migrants but also provisions that would cut legal immigration almost in half. It looked likely to pass.\n\nBut then the business community, so reliant on immigrant workers, showed up.\n\nA motley crew of corporate types, including lobbyists for ascendant Silicon Valley and Seattle tech companies like Microsoft, Intel and Hewlett-Packard, swarmed the nation's capital, navigating House and Senate hallways as well as the legislative process. Alongside the National Association of Manufacturers and other business groups, they spent months in crowded conference rooms finding common ground with Hispanic and civil rights organizations. They circulated policy briefs to persuadable lawmakers. They counted votes.\n\nThey poured resources into the effort, commissioning studies and getting op-eds published defending immigrants.\n\nThat spring, their coalition defeated the proposed bill and its attack on legal immigration, forcing Republicans to pursue a scaled-back, though still very tough , illegal immigration enforcement measure.\n\nAnd Buchanan, after several early victories in the primaries, dropped his bid for the presidency.\n\nThis was, for decades, the classic role of the business community in immigration politics. They rarely won total victories, and their motivation, typically, wasn't much more complicated than economic self-interest.\n\nFrom the U.S. Chamber of Commerce (the largest lobbying organization in the nation, representing business interests) to the \"Growers\" (agricultural businesses employing migrant farmworkers) to hotel, restaurant and construction industry associations, they spent time and money on Capitol Hill largely to fend off threats to their existing supply of immigrant labor. They also advocated for guest worker programs and a range of types of visas and work permits for new foreign-born workers.\n\nBut they were always there , on the Hill and in the public conversation. They built coalitions, leveraging their considerable influence over Republicans and finding the compromises with Democrats that were available to make.\n\nAnd in the process, they fundamentally moderated the nation's immigration debate.\n\nThese business groups - alongside immigration and labor advocacy groups on the left, including the National Council of La Raza (now called UnidosUS) and the United Farm Workers - helped achieve multiple overhauls of the U.S. immigration system this way. They were deeply involved in the negotiations that led to President Ronald Reagan's sweeping legalization of the status of undocumented immigrants in 1986 . Then, they successfully fought for the creation of several new and expanded visa categories, as well as the Temporary Protected Status program, in 1990.\n\nEven when they failed to get subsequent immigration reform bills passed, their continued active presence in the debate provided a crucial counterweight to the nativist wing of the Republican Party - which was always close to power, long before Donald Trump came on the political scene.\n\nAs Virginia Lamp, who during that period was an immigration and labor-relations lobbyist for the Chamber of Commerce, once put it to a panel of immigration experts, the business community had to challenge the \"faulty assumption\" that immigration negatively affects the economy (and that the border is \"out of control\"). These ideas, she said, are \"based on a type of selfish nationalism.\"\n\nVirginia Lamp is now Ginni Thomas, the hyperconservative wife of Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas . She is better known these days as an \"America First\" election denier.\n\nIndeed, things have changed.\n\nAccording to ProPublica interviews with more than 20 longtime business lobbyists across a range of industries, as well as congressional staffers and federal officials, the U.S. business community has increasingly retreated from immigration politics over the past decade and especially this year. They have largely relinquished their previous role as a lobbying force and moderating presence on this issue, despite their need for immigrant workers arguably being greater than ever . And they've been noticeably absent even as the current Republican presidential candidate promises to deploy the military to mass-deport 15 million to 20 million immigrants , and even as he continues to hack away at the political popularity of immigration itself - the effects of which might be felt for decades to come.\n\nSome erstwhile pro-immigration business leaders in Silicon Valley in particular have not only declined to speak out against Trump's rhetoric and policy plans, they have gone all in on him . Elon Musk, an immigrant , has immersed himself in nativism . Mark Zuckerberg says that he's done with politics , despite once making immigration reform a priority.\n\nMany business leaders have backed away from this policy area out of a calculation that they can still get corporate tax cuts and slashed labor and environmental regulations from Trump's version of the Republican Party, several prominent business lobbyists told me.\n\nIn a hyperpolarized political climate in which getting something practical done on immigration would be difficult - and costly, in terms of both political capital and lobbying dollars - they've had to mostly set it aside for now, many said.\n\nRandy Johnson, a previous senior vice president at the Chamber of Commerce, spent decades in Washington, D.C., lobbying for comprehensive immigration reform among other employment issues. In recent interviews and emails with ProPublica, though, he said that \"immigration, while an important issue for the business community, has never been a tier-one issue.\" He said that it's typically easier to raise a \"war chest\" of lobbying dollars from chamber members when the subject is Occupational Safety and Health Administration regulations, worker unionization or tax reform (including reducing taxes on inherited wealth). Those are all bigger immediate concerns for CEOs, Johnson said, because \"the impact on the bottom line is more direct and obvious,\" whereas \"the benefits of immigration reform tend to be more uncertain and diffuse.\"\n\n\"Business has kind of abdicated the field at the grassroots level,\" said C. Stewart Verdery Jr., founder of Monument Advocacy, a lobbying and consulting firm that counts Microsoft, Amazon, J.P. Morgan, Netflix, Starbucks and PepsiCo as clients, among others. Verdery was previously assistant secretary for policy at the Department of Homeland Security, in a role overseeing both Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection. \"When I've seen business get really engaged, when they really want something - whether it's tax reform, permitting reform, trade deals - there's a lot that they can do.\"\n\nVerdery said that businesses and business associations could, for example, spend $100 million on ambitious media campaigns to counteract the anti-immigrant rhetoric that Fox News churns out every night. They could run ads, fund rallies, get involved in local political races.\n\nBut they have not done these things lately, at least not on any large scale. Meanwhile, right-wing groups continue to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on increasingly extreme anti-immigrant advertising .\n\nEven when the most consequential bipartisan immigration legislation in years came before Congress earlier this year , business groups and lobbyists didn't flock to congressional offices and hearing rooms the way that they had in 1986 and 1990 and 1996 (and 2001, and 2005, 2006 and 2007, and 2013). They weren't there in force to supply their industry expertise and fight for the best possible bill, as was once their MO - nor did they push back aggressively when Trump started attacking the bill for political reasons .\n\n\"They know how to play power games,\" said Rick Swartz, an immigration lobbyist who since the 1980s has helped forge coalitions of business groups, liberal advocates and policymakers in Washington. He founded the National Immigration Forum, an umbrella organization of immigration advocacy groups. \"There have been real battles happening, that are consequential, that business has a lot at stake in,\" Swartz said. \"Where are they?\"\n\nMany ostensibly pro-immigration business interests, like the Koch network, have been pouring money into the campaigns of business-friendly conservative candidates even if they attack immigrants, Swartz said. \"Money is fungible,\" he said, so supporting such candidates \"fuels nativism even if derivatively and hidden by the occasional op-ed or roundtable study.\"\n\n\"This, to me,\" he concluded, \"is declining to rise to the moment.\"\n\nViewed through a purely economic lens, the business sector would have every reason to keep fighting for more immigrants. The U.S.-born working population is in relative decline , due to both our postpandemic labor shortage and the aging and retirement of tens of millions of baby boomers. Around 8 million jobs nationally are sitting unfilled right now - untapped capacity that companies could unleash more of with more workers from abroad, who are younger on average .\n\nOf course, many manufacturing jobs have actually been shipped overseas, many service jobs automated. Some bad-actor businesses, too, rely on migrant workers continuing to be undocumented; it makes those workers easier to exploit .\n\nStill, without immigrants, businesses around the country that rely on in-person work would struggle to find enough people to hire. In construction, homes would go unbuilt, causing housing prices, already painfully high , to soar. Nursing homes and the home health care sector, dangerously understaffed as they are , would face a crisis-level labor shortage. Ditto with child care and the dairy industry . And Big Tech would lose some of its best and brightest.\n\nMoreover, our current immigration system is chaotic, choked with visa and asylum backlogs. Every day, migrant workers face tremendous uncertainty about whether they can even legally go to work.\n\nBusiness generally prizes stability and predictability among its employees. Reform would seem to be a priority.\n\nBut the elephant in the room is Trump. Under his thrall, the anti-immigrant wing of the GOP has mushroomed, its rhetoric increasingly frightening to Chamber of Commerce types, many told me in interviews. They've become wary of even seeming like traditional Republicans anymore, some said, let alone advocating publicly on this issue.\n\n\"Businesses are inherently risk-averse,\" said Jennie Murray, president and CEO of the National Immigration Forum. In an earlier role, she ran the forum's Corporate Roundtable for the New American Workforce, an immigrant worker-integration program co-founded by Walmart and Chobani.\n\nMurray pointed to recent episodes in which Trump and other Republicans have directly attacked private companies as reasons why the business community doesn't want to do as much public-facing advocacy on this issue right now. (Trump has gone after Twitter , the NFL , Amazon , Apple and General Motors , among others; for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, it's Disney .)\n\nMurray said that some businesses and business groups are still working with the federal government in a more behind-the-scenes way, on issues like processing visa backlogs, advancing immigrant worker training and developing services for refugee employees.\n\nBob Worsley, a real estate and energy business owner who was also an Arizona state senator and is now co-chair of the board of the American Business Immigration Coalition , said that the recent relative inactivity of the business community on immigration can partly be attributed to a type of \"cancel culture.\" In an atmosphere in which your political party (he's a Republican) and even your church expect you to be in favor of things like deporting migrants, Worsley said, business owners have developed a \"fear of coming out\" about their support of immigration. Doing so, he said, can actively be bad for business.\n\nSeveral business owners highlighted last year's right-wing boycott of Bud Light as a worst-case scenario - losing customers en masse for taking even a mild stand on a hot-button political topic.\n\n\"It's become almost an impossible juxtaposition,\" Worsley said. Many of his fellow businesspeople support Trump, \"and yet their business relies on these workers, or they would not be in business.\"\n\nDenyse Sabagh, a past president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association and a longtime immigration advocate representing businesses and others, said that she hears from businesspeople \"every day\" who want help obtaining visas or legal status for their current or future employees. She said she often recommends that they contact their representatives in Congress, \"because the more that [lawmakers] hear from business, the more likely it's going to be effective.\" But her clients haven't been taking her up on that, she said.\n\n\"It's surprising to me that they're not more involved,\" Sabagh said. \"They're all clamoring for workers.\"\n\nEven if individual businesses are afraid of speaking up, it would ostensibly be the job of the business associations and coalitions to publicize and advocate for what their members' long-term labor needs are. But they too have been shying away from doing so of late.\n\nThe executive director of the Critical Labor Coalition, which includes the American Hotel and Lodging Association, the National Restaurant Association, Chipotle and other business groups and businesses, has even said that it's best to avoid saying the word \"immigration\" on Capitol Hill altogether and, instead, to use \"workforce solutions.\"\n\nThis all creates a feedback loop, business lobbyists and congressional staffers said. Business looks at the state of things on the Hill and in presidential politics and sees more land mines than viable immigration reforms to rally around. As a result, Republicans no longer get as much input from business on this topic - which they have historically been responsive to. Then, the political conversation focuses ever more narrowly on the border, crime and asylum backlogs, none of which are as interesting to business as legal immigration and visas.\n\nThat's too bad, said J. Michael Treviño, a Texas businessman, civil rights advocate and proponent of immigration reform; he has spent much of his career in the oil and gas industry. Treviño said that when the business community isn't at the table, policymakers \"lose the facts\" about how immigrants generate economic growth and benefit society.\n\nBusiness leaders and advocates providing those facts, he said, is \"the only way that you can actually refute the misinformation, of which there is so much.\"\n\nThis didn't all start with Trump, of course.\n\nIn the mid-2000s, congressional staffers along with business and other pro-immigration groups were busy hashing out the details of a bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform compromise shepherded by Sens. Ted Kennedy and John McCain.\n\nBut something had been happening politically in the years since 9/11, a nation-changing event that ushered in a newly intense fear of foreigners stoked by increasingly powerful media personalities at Fox News and on talk radio. Businesspeople and their allies in Congress didn't fully grasp this phenomenon until lawmakers faced an onslaught of grassroots right-wing opposition to the legislation, in 2006 and 2007 and heading into the 2008 election. Even McCain turned against it, amid his race for president that year. ( He still lost. )\n\nMany of those dynamics have persisted, leading several business leaders and lobbyists supportive of immigration reform to tell me that it's not them who have changed. It's the very nature of Congress, which was thrust into growing levels of dysfunction from 2008 onward, a period that also included xenophobia surrounding the first Black president; President Barack Obama's own rightward turns on immigration ; the rise of social media and the misinformation it spreads about this issue in particular; and increased partisan gerrymandering and polarization generally.\n\nYet all of that notwithstanding, much bipartisan federal legislation has still been passed in recent years. And the food , drug , gun and oil industries still push for less-popular policies by throwing their considerable money and muscle at lobbying.\n\nCharles Kamasaki, a longtime immigration reform expert and advocate who wrote the definitive book on 1986's successful reform effort and the other legislative battles that followed, put it this way: \"Business still gets what they think of as a fair hearing on Capitol Hill, but only on issues that are 'existential' to them.\" These days, he said, that mainly means tax cuts and deregulation.\n\nImmigration is \"being trumped, pun intended, by other considerations,\" Kamasaki said.\n\nWhen businesses do still engage on immigration, he added, it's usually to try to shape a specific piece of policy affecting their specific industry's often narrow interests. It's not as coalitional and big-picture anymore, which diminishes the old strength in numbers. They're much less likely than they once were to stand up for comprehensive immigration reform on the grounds that immigration, writ large, is good.\n\nSome corporate-backed lobbying groups, such as fwd.us and the American Business Immigration Coalition, have stayed involved in immigration politics in a forward-looking, idealistic way, although they aren't as powerful of a presence on Capitol Hill. Businesses will still speak up , meanwhile, against efforts to make them responsible for checking the immigration status of their workers, including through E-Verify . They'll also get behind relatively popular causes like a pathway to citizenship for \"Dreamers.\" And Chamber of Commerce officials have highlighted recent reforms to the EB-5 visa program for immigrant investors as well as incremental increases to the cap on H-2B visas (for temporary or seasonal workers in the hotel, landscaping and other industries) as advocacy successes.\n\nSome in the agricultural sector, perhaps more reliant on undocumented migrant workers than any other, have even recently begun to sound the alarm on Trump's mass-deportation proposals.\n\nSwartz, the pro-immigration lobbyist, acknowledged that there are exceptions to the idea that the business community has disengaged from the politics of immigration entirely. \"But it's the big picture, about power and the exercise of power,\" he said. He added that businesses have a special responsibility to do much more than they're currently doing because in a possible Trump mass-deportation situation, \"the easiest undocumented people to target will be in the workplace.\"\n\nAll the while, without the reliable participation of business, center-left immigration advocacy groups have been feeling as though they \"don't have a partner in this anymore,\" said Lanae Erickson, a senior vice president at Third Way, a center-left public policy think tank.\n\nAnd the left, still fighting for a path to citizenship for undocumented people, family immigration policies and protections for refugees, is out in the cold.\n\nRead More\n\nCraig Regelbrugge, a business lobbyist who in the late '90s and aughts represented agriculture interests including in his role as chair of the Agriculture Coalition for Immigration Reform, remembers the \"sense of purpose\" of being fully absorbed in immigration politics back then. That included negotiating with his ostensible opponent, the leadership of the United Farm Workers , to jointly pressure policymakers to make effective immigration policy.\n\n\"I just don't think there's as much of that happening anymore,\" Regelbrugge said. He pointed to how the organized anti-immigrant movement of the Trump era wears its ideology as a badge of honor, fundraises and spends off of that, and shows up for the fight. Business, Regelbrugge said, could stand to relearn those arts.\n\nHelp ProPublica Reporters Investigate the Immigration System\n\nWe need your help to find productive ways to examine the country's immigration system - what's working and what isn't.

      "text": "What's Next for U.S. Immigration Policy on the Southern Border?\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nLast week, President Joe Biden signed an executive order to curb immigration, effectively blocking most asylum claims when border crossings spike to a certain level. The move comes amid mounting concerns from across the political spectrum over immigration, which has emerged as a major voter issue this election year.\n\nSome Democrats and human rights advocates have warned the Biden administration that the executive order could exacerbate the humanitarian crisis at the border, putting immigrants at greater risk as they wait on the Mexican side of the border. A recent analysis by ProPublica and The Texas Tribune found lawmakers, advocates and government officials previously issued similar warnings that went unheeded before a fire in a Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, detention center killed 40 men in March 2023.\n\nTwo weeks before the fire, which was one of the deadliest incidents involving immigrants in Mexico's history, the Congressional Research Service published a report saying that the Mexican government did not have adequate resources to handle the influx of U.S.-bound migrants. \"As a result, migrants remain vulnerable to crime and other abuses,\" the report concluded.\n\nThe ProPublica and Tribune examination, which was accompanied by an 18-minute documentary titled \" The Right Way ,\" unpacks the deadly consequences of policies such as Title 42, an emergency health code used by former President Donald Trump to slow immigration and continued under Biden. Even though the pandemic-era policy, which enabled the quick expulsion of 2.8 million immigrants, ended in May 2023, migrants continued to be stranded in Mexican cities because of other U.S. policies.\n\nThe week before Biden's executive order, ProPublica and the Tribune hosted a virtual panel with experts to discuss U.S. policies that contributed to the fire, changes to the U.S. asylum system and why immigration has become a leading concern among voters as they prepare for this year's presidential election. Speakers included:\n\nBelow are excerpts from the panel's discussion, which have been edited for clarity and concision.\n\nAndrew Selee: The American public overwhelmingly thinks it's a crisis. At least four polls that came out recently tell the same story, which is that Americans are quite pro-immigration , but they're also really worried about the border . This cuts across party lines now. Yes, Republicans are more concerned about the border than Democrats, but Democrats have moved on this issue as have independents.\n\nWhen you have a system that can't make decisions about who should come into the country, that undermines the credibility of your immigration system. It makes people more worried about immigration in general and less willing to support things like legal pathways that would actually help.\n\nWe don't have a crisis in terms of our well-being as a society, but we do have a crisis in terms of being able to make decisions about who comes in and keep some sort of control over immigration policy. I'm worried if we don't figure this part out, we're going to see a backlash against immigration that will hurt all of us.\n\nMaureen Meyer: As the administration looks to reduce numbers at the border so that it doesn't seem like a crisis, what you end up having is a humanitarian crisis on the Mexican side of the border. As numbers have dropped here, especially since last December, Mexico is encountering over 120,000 migrants a month. So what you have is a crisis that you're exporting farther south.\n\nVictor Manjarrez: Normally, I would say that that's pretty significant, but that 50% drop is compared to December, when we had historically large numbers in terms of arrests along the southwest border.\n\nEven with that drop, it's estimated that there is going to be between 1.6 to 1.7 million arrests. The high-water mark was 1.6 million in 2000 for the longest time. When the numbers went up in 2022 and 2023 to 2.2 million, it was crushing because it does a number of things. You have to collapse your operations, and you have to vacate areas to handle the flows that come in.\n\nThe dynamic used to be that most people try to evade early detection. Now, people surrender to claim asylum. That doesn't take away from the fact that it takes a large number of resources, from transportation to the logistics of processing.\n\nWatch the Panel Discussion\n\nSelee: I think you want three elements. You want people to be able to come on legal pathways to take available jobs. Right now, we have 8 to 10 million jobs a month that are open, and it's a very tight labor market. You want a way of connecting employers with willing workers. We don't have that right now. We have a system built in 1990 that has numbers set in stone by Congress 34 years ago in a different economy. That's one element you have to update.\n\nSecondly, you need a refugee system where people who are fleeing things that would put their lives in danger can get into the United States through asylum, either by applying at the border or ideally earlier. Ideally, we want a humanitarian protection system that starts in the region, particularly since we know most people are coming from somewhere in Latin America and the Caribbean, but then has a fail-safe at the border.\n\nYou have to be able to return people who don't meet those two characteristics: who aren't coming on a legal pathway and aren't granted asylum. You have to make decisions on protection fairly quickly, by the way. If it takes four or five years, which is what it takes right now to get a decision, you're not giving protection to people who need it. But you're also creating a pull factor for people who might not have otherwise applied for protection. We don't tend to remove a lot of people who've been in the country that long. People know that if they make it to the U.S. border, they are likely to get in.\n\nThat's a system that doesn't make sense for people who need protection, but it also doesn't make sense from a migration protection standpoint. We then turn to Mexico and other countries along the way and say, let's make it harder for people to get here. We would be much better off with a system that gave protection that had legal pathways but also returned people who don't come through those ways. But we've ended up with a system that simply tries to slow people down.\n\nSelee: They've really stretched the limits of what they can do with the executive branch to create legal pathways. They've tried to increase employer interest. They created quite a large pathway for Cubans, Haitians, Venezuelans and Nicaraguans, groups of people where there are displacement crises. It made sense to stretch what they call humanitarian parole powers to allow people to enter the country and have a work permit for two years. They've tried to speed up asylum and create incentives for people to go to ports of entry to apply for asylum rather than going between ports of entry. But without resources, without authorities, without Congress, it's hard to create legal pathways. Unless Congress gets involved, appropriates money and provides some authorities, particularly on the legal pathway side, it becomes very hard to get done.\n\nWe saw an attempt by Republicans and Democrats, but that fell apart so we're back to where we were\n\nSelee: It would have codified some of the things they did to restrict asylum. For decisions on asylum, it would've put more money into the Border Patrol and into ICE, for processing people and for returns. It's a Band-Aid, but sometimes Band-Aids are important too. It would have at least created a more virtuous cycle for people who have strong asylum claims to present themselves at the border and a disincentive for people who know they don't have strong claims.\n\nOn the flip side, Mexico came out for the first time ever with a national strategy on migration. How does Mexico relate to its own diaspora, i.e., the 12 million Mexicans that live in the U.S.? How does Mexico deal with asylum-seekers? Like with the U.S., it's a question of resources and authorities and how you actually do it.\n\nMeyer: In terms of the Biden administration, we will continue to see a harder-line policy. President Biden and Mexico President Andrés Manuel López Obrador spoke a few weeks ago and talked about how they're going to increase enforcement to reduce the number of migrants reaching the borders.\n\nIf it is a Biden second term, we will hopefully see a shift back to expanding legal pathways, improving the system, adding more resources and a continuation of these programs, especially the regional programs.\n\nWith Trump's first term, we saw canceling refugee resettlement numbers or dramatically lowering them, canceling programs that Biden restarted like the Central America's Minors Program, building more wall and, as you said, increased mass deportation. It's a very contrasting view of the situation at the border that will have stark differences come January 2025.\n\nRead More\n\nFiled under -\n\nConnor Goodwin was a Communications Manager with ProPublica.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nThe text came from inside a Panamanian government outpost, set hours away from the country's capital, on the edge of the Darien jungle.\n\nIt had been written by a migrant who'd managed to smuggle a cellphone into the facility by hiding it in his shorts. He said authorities had detained him without providing him access to a lawyer or any means to communicate with relatives. He was hungry because all he was being fed were small portions of bread and rice. His cellphone was all he had to try to get help.\n\nI am Hayatullah Omagh, from Afghanistan, 29 years old.\n\nI arrived in February, 07 in USA.\n\nThey took me to the San Diego detention center and on Feb, 12 they deported to Panama.\n\nNow we are like prisoners.\n\nHe was one of the lucky ones. Most of the hundred or so other migrants who were being detained with him had no way to communicate with the outside world. They'd been sent to Panama as part of President Donald Trump's high-profile campaign to ramp up deportations . In addition to Afghanistan, the migrants had traveled to the U.S. from Iran, Uzbekistan, Nepal, Vietnam, India and China, among other countries. Some told reporters that they had only recently crossed the U.S.-Mexico border when they were detained, and that they were hoping to seek asylum. But, they said, American authorities refused to hear their pleas and then treated them like criminals, putting them in shackles, loading them onto military airplanes and flying them from California to Panama.\n\nThree flights, carrying a total of 299 migrants, including children as young as 5, landed in Panama in mid-February. For the following three weeks, amid an international outcry over what critics described as a stunning breach of U.S. and international law, the migrants who had not committed any crimes were held against their will. As public pressure on Panama mounted and immigrant advocates filed suit against that country, authorities there released the migrants over the weekend, on the condition that they agree to make their own arrangements to leave within 90 days.\n\nTheir release has hardly settled matters, however, among those groups that consider themselves part of the international safety net charged with providing migrants humanitarian support. Among them is the International Organization for Migration , which helped Panama return migrants who chose to go home rather than remain in detention. The IOM said it participated in the effort because it believes that without its presence the situation for migrants would be \"far worse.\" Critics charge that the group's role shows how much the safety net relies on the United States and as a result can easily come undone.\n\n\"I appreciate that some individuals hold the view that providing a more humane detention and deportation or voluntary return is better than a less humane version of those unequivocal rights violations,\" said Hannah Flamm, an attorney with the International Refugee Assistance Project, a legal advocacy group in New York. \"But in the context of egregious unlawful conduct by the Trump administration, this is a moment that calls for deep introspection on where the line of complicity lies.\"\n\nShe added, \"If everybody abided by their legal and ethical obligations not to violate the rights of people seeking protection in the U.S., these third-country removals could not happen.\"\n\nSince taking office, Trump has signed several executive orders that eliminated options for seeking asylum at the border and deemed all crossings illegal, broadly authorizing the removal of migrants encountered there. The American Civil Liberties Union and other advocacy groups sued over the orders. The United States has not responded to the lawsuit in court. The proceedings against Panama, in the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, are not conducted in public. But at a press conference on the day after the first planeload of migrants landed last month, the country's president dodged, reassuring the public that the migrants were only passing through Panama on their way elsewhere. Their stay would be brief and cost nothing, he said, and added that it had all been \"organized and paid for by the International Organization for Migration.\"\n\nThe IOM, founded in the aftermath of World War II and now part of the United Nations, typically plays a critical, but low-profile, role helping migrants including those who, when faced with deportation, seek instead to voluntarily return to their homes. It provides everything from advice to governments managing sudden mass refugee movements to travel documents, food and lodging for individual migrants. And its mission statement charges it with upholding the rights of people on the move.\n\nHowever, its role in support of sending home asylum-seekers who'd been expelled from the United States without the opportunity to make a case for protection from persecution has exposed just how easily the safety net can come undone.\n\nIn response to the Trump administration's litany of threats against Mexico and Central America - including imposing tariffs, cutting off aid and, in Panama's case, seizing its canal - those governments have taken extraordinary steps that upend international and diplomatic norms by agreeing to allow the Trump administration to turn their countries into extensions of the U.S. immigration enforcement system. President Rodrigo Chaves Robles of Costa Rica, whose government has historically gone to great lengths to uphold itself as neutral in regional conflicts and strife, also allowed U.S. migrant flights to land in his country. In a public event last month, he made the stakes plain.\n\n\"We're helping our powerful economic brother in the north,\" he said, \"because if they impose a tax on our export zones, we're screwed.\"\n\nRead More\n\nMeanwhile, groups like the IOM are just as vulnerable to U.S. pressure. Some 40% of the donations that have funded its work come from the United States. And in recent weeks, the organization was forced to lay off thousands of workers after Trump froze billions of dollars in foreign aid. What that means, according to a former Biden administration official who worked on migration issues, is that when the United States makes a request, even ones that risk going against the IOM's mission, \"there is not a lot of space to say no.\"\n\nSpeaking of the IOM, the official added that it \"almost can't exist without the U.S.\"\n\nWithout the legal protections established under international law, asylum-seekers like those that the United States transported to Panama have been left to fend for themselves. By the time many of them had made it to the United States, they had little more than the clothes on their backs and the money in their pockets. And U.S. authorities expelled them exactly as they'd come. Upon landing in Panama, authorities confiscated any cellphones they found in the migrants' possession. Omagh was one of the few who'd managed to keep his phone from being discovered.\n\nThe situation in the Darien Forest is extremely difficult. There are security guards everywhere and they are very vigilant. They even watch us when we go to the bathroom.\n\nDistressed texts like those provided the only information about what the migrants were going through while they were in detention. Before being sent to the Darien camp, Panamanian authorities kept the migrants under 24-hour watch by armed guards at a hotel in downtown Panama City. But when scenes of them standing in the hotel windows with handwritten pleas for help, some scrawled in toothpaste on the glass, triggered an international outcry, IOM officials quickly moved to fly out more than half of the migrants who agreed to be sent home and the Panamanian government shuttled the rest to the remote Darien camp.\n\nOn at least two occasions, Panamanian officials offered to allow journalists into the camp to speak with the detainees, but they canceled both times without explanation. Since then, they have declined multiple requests for interviews. Panamanian lawyers said they were also denied access to the migrants.\n\nSecret cellphone chatter filled the void, offering glimpses of the conditions inside the camp. Migrants wrote that bathrooms and showers had no doors for privacy, and that they were held in sweltering temperatures without air conditioning. One migrant had gone on a hunger strike for seven days. Omagh wrote that when he and others complained about the quantity and quality of the food, authorities offered to buy more if the detainees paid for it.\n\nWe immigrants, each of us, have no more than $100, and some don't even have a single dollar. How long can we buy ourselves?\n\nOn Friday, the Panamanian government announced it would release the 112 migrants left. The authorities said that those migrants who stayed beyond the three-month time limit risked being deported. Migrants said they were also told they would only be allowed to leave the camp if they agreed to sign a document saying they had not been mistreated - potentially making it hard for them to file legal claims later.\n\nThe following day, IOM and Panamanian officials entered the camp again and told the migrants that they would be asked to vacate the premises in a matter of hours, setting off a new wave of pandemonium and anxiety among the detainees, most of whom speak no Spanish and have no contacts or places to stay in Panama. Omagh, who understood what was happening because he'd picked up some Spanish when he migrated to the United States through Mexico, texted about the upheaval.\n\nI asked, if we go to Panama City, what will happen there? We are refugees. We don't have money. We do not have nothing. The IOM told me 'it is your responsibility.'\n\nI don't know what will happen there, but I'm sure that IOM, they will not help us.\n\nWhen asked about these comments, the IOM said that because its staff helped Panamanian officials with interpretation, migrants in the camp often confuse who is who. Jorge Gallo, a regional spokesperson for the IOM in Latin America and the Caribbean, defended his group's involvement in Panama. He said the agency's work \"empowering migrants to make informed decisions, even in the face of constrained options, is preferable to no choice at all.\"\n\nHe and other IOM officials said the organization helps migrants find \"safe alternatives,\" including helping them go to other countries where they can obtain a legal status if they don't choose to go home.\n\nThe State Department and Department of Homeland Security did not respond to detailed questions about the expulsions. However, a State Department spokesperson expressed gratitude to those countries that had agreed to cooperate, saying they showed that they are \"committed to ending the crisis of illegal immigration to the United States.\"\n\nWithin the human rights community, advocates are at odds with one another about what to do. As the Panamanian government prepared to move migrants out of the Darien camp, IOM officials reached out to faith-based shelter managers seeking places for the migrants to stay. Elías Cornejo, migrant services coordinator for the Jesuit ministry Fe y Alegría in Panama City, said some of the managers hesitated because they worried that anything that gave the appearance that they were advancing policies that run contrary to the law could taint their reputation.\n\n\"It's Like They Want to Delete Us\"\n\nThe IOM, Cornejo said, might be trying to do the right thing, but its actions can have unintended consequences that would be hard to undo. He said the agency was \"whitewashing\" Panama's collusion and \"dirtying its own hands\" by participating in an improvised effort \"without control and without the possibility of doing something good for the people.\"\n\nAs the migrants at the Darien camp scrambled to figure out what they'd do after leaving, they felt free to openly use their phones and to share them with one another.\n\nTatiana Nikitina got a message from her 28-year-old brother, who'd migrated to the United States from Russia. He had been detained after crossing the border near San Diego, but her family hadn't heard from him for days and was panicked that he might be forced to return home. Not knowing where to turn for answers about his whereabouts, his sister sought information in public chat groups and then began communicating with ProPublica about her desperate search for him.\n\nHer brother, Nikita Gaponov, using Omagh's phone, also communicated with ProPublica and explained why he fled home.\n\nI am LGBT. My country harass these people.\n\nI cannot live a normal life in my country. It's impossible for me.\n\nHe said he spoke with IOM representatives about his fears.\n\nThey said, We are sorry we cannot help you.\n\nI also do not know my USA status like it was deportation or not\n\nIn USA they show me zero documents. No protocols or nothing.\n\nOmagh, too, said he was terrified about the prospect of returning to Afghanistan. He said he is from an ethnic minority group that is systematically persecuted by the ruling Taliban and that he'd been briefly jailed.\n\nThey will execute me without hesitation.\n\nI want to apply for asylum, but I don't know where I can apply for asylum, in which country, and how.\n\nI cannot go back to my country, never, never, never.\n\nLexi Churchill contributed research.\n\nFiled under -\n\nLomi Kriel is an investigative reporter for the ProPublica-Texas Tribune Investigative Initiative.\n\nI'm a reporter with the ProPublica-Texas Tribune investigative unit and focus on border and immigration issues.\n\nContact me, by email or securely on Signal, with tips about the role Texas is currently playing in immigration enforcement and the impact of policies on both sides of the border.\n\nMica Rosenberg is an investigative reporter on ProPublica's national desk focusing on immigration.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "What Donald Trump's Win Means For Immigration\n\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has promised a sweeping overhaul of U.S. immigration policy, one that aims to build upon and escalate the already strident measures of his first term.\n\nPer the plans he shared throughout his campaign, Trump intends to commence mass deportations of millions of people, a project that could be marked by widespread workplace raids and the involvement of the U.S. military, all while putting federal resources into expanding the border wall at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nShould Trump move forward with his proposed agenda, it would represent a dramatic shift in American immigration policy, targeting millions of undocumented immigrants and redefining the nation's approach to newcomers.\n\nTrump's dark view of immigration has helped define his political career since he launched his first presidential campaign in 2015. His rhetoric around the issue has raised concerns that his immigration agenda is rooted in an idealized fantasy of racial purity. He said in a speech in December that migrants coming into the U.S. are \"poisoning the blood of our country.\" Last month, he said undocumented immigrants who commit murder have \" bad genes .\"\n\nTrump's proposals have reignited debates around legality, ethics, and the potential societal impacts of such an expansive crackdown. Critics argue that his strategies could pose fundamental challenges to civil rights and humanitarian obligations. But Trump's campaign  capitalized on rising public discontent regarding immigration and border security, framing their plans as a necessary response to what Trump describes as a national crisis.\n\nHere's what to know about Trump's immigration plan now that he has won the presidential election.\n\nTrump made plans for mass deportations of undocumented immigrants a central feature of his immigration discussions ahead of securing his second term. He signaled an ambition to carry out what he calls the \"largest domestic deportation operation in American history.\" That could mean a years-long effort to remove an estimated 11 million people who are in the country without authorization. The Trump Administration aims to leverage expedited removal processes, which allow for rapid deportations without the usual legal hearings.\n\nHis campaign emphasized that such measures are within existing legal frameworks and would not require new legislation. They argued that mass deportations would benefit American workers by raising wages and improving job conditions. However, experts have warned that the abrupt removal of millions of immigrants would likely lead to economic instability, particularly in industries heavily reliant on undocumented labor, such as agriculture and hospitality.\n\nCritics of Trump's deportation strategy contend that it is inhumane, citing potential violations of due process and the trauma that mass removals could inflict on families and communities. Many of the people targeted have lived in the U.S. for years and have children who are U.S. citizens. The implications of such a drastic policy shift could also extend far beyond immigration, fundamentally reshaping the demographic and economic landscape of the nation.\n\nRead More : How Trump Won\n\nTrump's proposal to use the military for immigration enforcement marks a significant escalation in the federal government's approach to undocumented immigrants. By invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 and the Insurrection Act, he plans to deploy federal troops to assist in apprehending migrants at the southern border, a move that raises serious legal and ethical concerns regarding the role of the military in domestic law enforcement.\n\nTrump has said he will move thousands of troops currently stationed overseas to the southern border of the U.S. He has also said he will deploy the U.S. Navy to impose a blockade of fentanyl and fentanyl precursor chemicals from entering the country.\n\nThe militarization of immigration policy reflects Trump's broader strategy of framing immigration as a security threat, portraying all undocumented immigrants as dangers to public safety. The intention is to create an unprecedented formidable presence at the border, bolstered by the National Guard and local police from Republican-led states. Advocates argue that this approach is essential for national security, while critics view it as a dangerous precedent that undermines civil liberties and could lead to excessive force against vulnerable populations.\n\nTrump also wants to build new detention camps to hold undocumented immigrants awaiting deportation, which the campaign says will enable faster processing and removal of immigrants. This effort will also likely include the military. Opponents fear that this approach could mirror past abuses in immigration enforcement, where the rights of individuals are overlooked in favor of rapid, large-scale removals.\n\nA second Trump Administration plans to expand workplace raids as a method of identifying and apprehending undocumented immigrants. The strategy, which he also ramped up in his first term, aims to increase the visibility and enforcement of immigration laws in everyday settings, targeting industries that frequently employ unauthorized workers.\n\nTrump has suggested that these raids will not only deter unauthorized employment but also lead to significant labor market shifts, benefiting American workers. However, the practical implications of such raids could be far-reaching, disrupting local economies and instilling fear within immigrant communities. Critics argue that workplace raids often result in chaos, separating families and exacerbating vulnerabilities among immigrant populations. The resulting atmosphere of mistrust can leave immigrants afraid to report crimes or seek help in dangerous situations for fear of deportation.\n\nExpanding and reinforcing the border wall is another cornerstone of Trump's immigration agenda, a promise that resonates deeply with his base.\n\nThe U.S.-Mexico border is nearly 2,000 miles long. During Trump's first term, the U.S. government built less than 500 miles of border wall, and much of it replaced smaller, dilapidated barriers.\n\nTrump's GOP party platform released during the Republican National Convention in July promised, \"We will complete the Border Wall.\" Trump has indicated plans to redirect military funding to construct new sections of the wall, defying congressional appropriations-an approach that mirrors tactics from his first term, when he prioritized border security over other federal funding priorities.\n\nAdvocates for the wall argue that it is necessary for national security and controlling illegal immigration. Yet, critics contend that the wall represents a misguided allocation of resources, with many experts arguing that immigration challenges require comprehensive reforms rather than punitive measures.\n\nThe prospect of renewed construction raises environmental and logistical concerns, particularly in regions where natural landscapes may be disrupted. Additionally, whether a border wall even works as a deterrent remains debated, with studies suggesting that a comprehensive approach addressing root causes of migration would be more effective in the long term.\n\nTrump has promised to reinstate the \"remain in Mexico\" policy he put in place during his first\n\nterm. This policy, formally called the Migrant Protection Protocols, forced migrants who entered the U.S. over the southern border and requested asylum to return to Mexico while their cases were heard. During the Trump administration, this led to more than 65,000 migrants not from Mexico struggling to find temporary shelter in northern Mexico.\n\nTrump plans to hire 10,000 new Border Patrol agents. This could be a difficult task, as the U.S. Border Patrol has struggled to fill existing positions due to low morale and funding issues. Trump has promised to offer pay raises and bonuses to enhance recruitment and retention within the agency.\n\nTrump's plan would enlarge the Border Patrol by 50% and require congressional approval. However, the campaign has not clarified how it would secure the necessary funding. In February, Republicans and Democrats in Congress had agreed on a border security deal that would have added 1,500 more Border Patrol agents and immigration personnel and expanded the roster of immigration judges and asylum officers. President Joe Biden promised to sign the measure. But the bill died after Trump told Republicans to wait to take action until after the election.\n\nOn his first day back in office, Trump has promised to issue an executive order ending the long-standing Constitutional principle that children born in the U.S. are granted citizenship. Trump said he will instruct federal agencies to require that any child born in the U.S. have at least one parent who is a lawful permanent resident or citizen, before they can be issued a passport or Social Security number.\n\nThe 14th Amendment of the Constitution guarantees that all people born in the U.S. have the rights of citizens, regardless of their race. Ratified in 1868, that amendment sought to remedy the harm caused by the Supreme Court's Dred Scott decision of 1857, which ruled that Black people were not citizens. Any executive action Trump takes to deny birthright citizenship to people born in the U.S. is sure to be challenged in court and would likely be fought all the way to the Supreme Court.\n\nTrump has promised to bring back the travel ban from Muslim-majority countries he implemented in his first term. His campaign wrote on X in October 2023 that he will \"reinstate and expand\" the ban on travel from \"terror-plagued countries\" and \"implement strong ideological screening for all immigrants.\"\n\nIn that post, the Trump campaign listed plans to send immigration agents to protests in the U.S. to remove \"pro-Jihadist\" demonstrators from the country and to revoke student visas of \"radical anti-American and anti-semitic foreigners\" at universities. \"Sympathy for jihadists, Hamas, or Hamas ideology will be automatically disqualifying\" for immigrants applying to enter the U.S, the campaign wrote.\n\nThose ideas were expanded in the GOP platform adopted during the Republican National Convention in July. \"Republicans will use existing Federal Law to keep foreign Christian-hating Communists, Marxists, and Socialists out of America,\" the party platform stated.\n\nWrite to Nik Popli at nik.popli@time.com"

      "text": "Trump Launches New Immigration Measures, Prompting Abrupt Shift in U.S. Border Policy\n\nM inutes after being sworn into office, President Donald Trump laid out a series of tough actions he's taking to stop border crossings between ports of entry and begin deporting some of millions of people in the U.S. without authorization. Those policy changes were expected to start rolling in fast in the first hours and days of his second term after a campaign in which Trump vowed to launch the largest deportation operation in the country's history.\n\nAmong his first actions back in office, Trump declared a national emergency at the border, which will free up military funding to build more sections of a border wall, support operations to stop border crossings, and send troops to the southern border to, as he said in his Inaugural Address , \"repel the disastrous invasion of our country.\"\n\nIn a sweeping proclamation that \"the current situation at the southern border qualifies as an invasion under Article IV, Section 4 of the Constitution of the United States,\" Trump proclaimed the suspension of physical entry of \"aliens engaged in the invasion\" across the southern border and directed his Cabinet members to \"take all appropriate action to repel, repatriate, or remove any alien engaged in the invasion,\" including expressly revoking the right for migrants to invoke an asylum claim.\n\nIn separate executive actions, Trump has attempted to redefine birthright citizenship , which is currently protected by the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, and he suspended the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program.\n\nTrump also ordered the Secretary of Defense-for which his nominee, Pete Hegseth, is not yet confirmed-to assign the U.S. Northern Command, a joint military command set up after 9/11 to combat terrorism and attacks on the U.S., \"the mission to seal the borders.\" And he designated cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.\n\nIn his Inaugural Address, Trump also said he would reinstate the \"Remain in Mexico\" policy that demands people seeking asylum wait outside the U.S. while their cases are considered-a move that will require cooperation from the Mexican government. Trump also pledged to use the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to pressure state and local police to arrest and help deport foreign-born people in the U.S. illegally.\n\nThe impact on the border of Trump's Inauguration was immediate. Moments after Trump was formally sworn in, people waiting at border crossings in Mexico reportedly had their asylum appointments canceled by Customs and Border Protection, and received messages that the federal program that used a phone app called CBP One to set up appointments for asylum seekers was now canceled. The Biden Administration started that program to create a more orderly system for people to seek asylum and deter migrants from crossing between points of entry and surrendering themselves to Border Patrol agents in order to have their claim heard.\n\nMany of Trump's actions will likely be challenged in court, as they were during his first term. When Trump declared a similar national emergency on the border in 2019 in order to justify using military funds for building a border wall, courts blocked the move, saying a military construction project needed to be in support of a military deployment.\n\nElizabeth Goitein, senior director of the Brennan Center's Liberty and National Security Program, says that Trump is overreaching with his use of emergency powers, especially since the number of people crossing the border unlawfully has been declining in recent months. \"This is an abuse of emergency powers for the same reason it was before,\" Goitein says, \"Emergency powers are not meant to address long-standing problems that Congress has the power to solve.\"\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

In a statement shortly after her arrest, ICE said the mother of four has a final deportation order and \"has received legal due process in U.S. immigration court.\"\n\nBut her lawyers say the order is not valid. They have filed a legal challenge asking U.S. District Judge Nina Wang to order federal authorities to release her.\n\nWang issued an order halting Vizguerra's deportation while the legal challenge plays out.\n\nICE began trying to deport Vizguerra in 2009 during the Obama administration after she was pulled over in suburban Denver and found to have a fraudulent Social Security card with her own name and birth date but someone else's number, according to a 2019 lawsuit she brought against ICE. Vizguerra did not know the number belonged to someone else at the time, the lawsuit said.\n\nWhile a judge issued an order of removal against her, she also was given the option to leave the country voluntarily, which she ultimately did to try to see her mother before she died in 2012, her lawyers said in the current petition before Wang.\n\nSince Vizguerra left on her own before later re-entering the U.S., there is no removal order for ICE to reinstate, the petition says.\n\nIt is not clear how soon Wang could rule. But she has noted the case raises \"complex issues\" about immigration law and she could not find a similar case.\n\n© 2025 TIME USA, LLC. All Rights Reserved.

      "text": "The Conservative Case for Immigration\n\nO ne of the most basic facts of American political life today is Republican opposition to immigration. According to Gallup, 73 percent of Republicans would prefer to see immigration levels decreased. All the current contenders for the GOP presidential nomination have sharply criticized the Biden Administration on border security, vowing if elected to crack down on illegal immigration, and Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis have proposed policies that would reduce legal immigration as well. Republicans in Congress are so concerned about the flow of migrants across the Southern border that they won't move forward with President Joe Biden's emergency aid request for Ukraine unless Democrats agree to a deal that would make it harder for people to seek asylum.\n\nBut if you think about it, there are good reasons for Republicans to favor more immigration.\n\nConsider religion. In general, the more modern a society becomes-the greater its advances in science, technology and education, the better developed its capitalist economy, the more urban its population-the less sway that religious institutions have over public life, and the less significance that religious beliefs and practices hold for its members. The US has been slower to secularize than Canada or Western Europe , which shows that the process isn't always straightforward . But as sociologists Isabella Kasselstrand, Phil Zuckerman, and Ryan Cragun have demonstrated , the situation is now changing, with every new birth cohort \"less religious than the one before.\"\n\nData from the General Social Survey indicate that in the early 1990s, about 60 percent of Americans aged 18-34 said they believed in God and had no doubts. Today that number stands at 36 percent. Over that same period, the proportion who could be described as atheist or agnostic more than doubled, to 22 percent. In recent years of the survey, about four out of ten younger adults have said that they never attend religious services.\n\nThe decline of American religiosity worries many on the right. Sixty-one percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents tell pollsters that religion is \"very important\" to them and more than half of Republicans believe that the US should be a Christian nation. Vivek Ramaswamy has made the restoration of faith central to his campaign, as did Mike Pence before he dropped out of the race.\n\nImmigration, however, is a major bulwark-perhaps the major bulwark-against secularization.\n\nImmigrants per se aren't any more religious than Americans born here, even though many hail from deeply religious nations. This could be because the U.S. remains unusually religious for a country with its level of economic development, because people with strong attachments to a religious community are less likely to migrate , or because moving from one country to another can disrupt religious habits .\n\nBut religion plays an outsized role in the lives of certain immigrant groups and their families. For example, while the religiosity of Latino Americans ( two thirds of whom were born in the U.S.) may be ebbing somewhat, Latinos are still more religious on average than others, which means that as the Latino population swells through new waves of immigration or higher fertility rates, it will offset religious losses elsewhere.\n\nChurches, temples, and mosques serving immigrant communities are among the most vibrant centers of worship in the nation, offering new Americans powerful religious experiences alongside essential social support . Were it not for migration from Latin America, U.S. Catholicism would be far weaker than it is: the Church, reeling from membership declines stemming from sexual abuse cases, has found new life in the South and West by ministering to large Latino populations. Immigrants are also reviving evangelical faith traditions like Pentecostalism .\n\nMr. Ramaswamy exemplifies the religiosity that can be found in many immigrant households: his Indian parents raised their American-born son a devout Hindu. As a group, Indian Americans lean strongly Democratic , making Mr. Ramaswamy's politics an outlier, but an added bonus of migration for the right is that at least on social and moral issues, recent immigrants tend to have more traditional view s (although this varies by country of origin, age, and education level.) The tension between such views and a surging progressive movement may help account for gains the GOP was able to eke out in many immigrant neighborhoods in 2020.\n\nEconomic prosperity is another conservative priority. (It's a priority for liberals as well.) The evidence on this score is that immigration helps American workers more than it hurts them.\n\nIn a seminal 1990 study , the economist David Card looked at what happened to the labor market in Miami after the Mariel Boatlift of 1980, when Fidel Castro allowed 125,000 Cubans, many of them political dissidents, to leave the country. Thousands wound up in Miami, and one might expect that by competing with other workers, they would have lowered wages and raised unemployment. But Card found that neither of these things had occurred. The reason was that industry in Miami was already set up to make use of Cuban workers' skills. Employers could therefore accommodate the surge, bringing new immigrants on board as previous employees \"moved to more desirable jobs.\"\n\nAlthough research on migration surges elsewhere has provided additional nuance to Card's findings, the general economic consensus now is that the Miami study spoke to a broader insight. In the short term, large increases in immigration may lower wages or employment in the occupations where those immigrants seek work. Over the longer term , however, immigration provides employers with an opportunity to expand their businesses, adding jobs to their payroll and ramping up production. Immigration thus \" grows the pie ,\" canceling out most if not all of the negative wage or employment effects.\n\nIn societies like ours with declining fertility rates, stalled population growth, and chronic labor shortages, immigration's role in boosting productivity is all the more important. This is why, in states like Texas, the business faction of the GOP tends to take a softer stance on immigration than other conservative groups. On top of that, immigration seems to promote innovation .\n\nWhat about inflation, a more specific economic issue that will be on the minds of many Republican voters next November? More immigrants means more consumers, and higher demand inevitably raises prices, right?\n\nNot necessarily. The economist Saul Lach studied how prices for consumer goods in Israel changed after hundreds of thousands of migrants from the former USSR moved there at the beginning of the 1990s. He found that the higher the ratio of such immigrants in a city's population, the lower prices tended to be-perhaps, as Dr. Lach speculated, because the immigrants were very poor and had no \"brand loyalties,\" forcing retailers to discount their products. In a similar vein, economist Filipa Sá discovered that increases in migration to communities in the U.K. reduced housing prices in those areas. Xenophobic residents with more money didn't want to live among the immigrants and moved, so the areas became more affordable.\n\nImmigrants are often willing to take jobs that others would not, which can also lower prices. The economist Patricia Cortes found that sizable increases in the number of unskilled immigrants in U.S. cities between 1980 and 2000 did reduce wages, but primarily for people already working in immigrant-intensive jobs like housekeeping and landscaping. Partly because of those decreased wages, however, the cost of the related services went down-by about 10 percent, in Dr. Cortes's estimate-increasing the purchasing power of other Americans.\n\nDo immigrants drag down the economy by relying on welfare benefits and other forms of public assistance? The suggestion that they do is politically powerful: the native-born overestimate immigrant reliance on welfare so much that mere mention of immigration reduces support for redistributive economic policies.\n\nThe fact is that nearly half of new immigrants nowadays have college degrees . Many of these individuals are high-skill professionals here to work in critical fields: 20 percent of physicians in the U.S. were born abroad. They're not using much public assistance.\n\nIt is true that poverty rates for immigrants are higher than for U.S.-born Americans-16 versus 7 percent in 2021, according to one recent analysis . Whether immigrants living under the poverty line are eligible for public assistance depends on their immigration status and the kind of safety net program you're talking about, but total government outlays (including welfare spending) to support first generation immigrants are not insubstantial, amounting to about $11,360 per person in 2018, according to the Cato Institute.\n\nYet the same Cato study found that the average immigrant made a \"fiscal contribution\" of about $16,200, between taxes they paid themselves and taxes paid by their employers on increased productivity. In other words, immigrants put more into government coffers than they took out.\n\nFinally, there's crime, which law-and-order conservatives almost inevitably link to immigration, as in Donald Trump's claim that \"when Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best... They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists.\"\n\nThat dangerous drugs, including fentanyl, are being smuggled across our nation's borders is unquestionable and cause for legitimate concern. But as for the rest of Mr. Trump's assertion, the research shows that immigrants, both documented and undocumented, commit serious crimes at lower rates than people born in the U.S. While some studies find no connection between the concentration of immigrants in an area and crime rates, others find that as this concentration rises, the area tends to become safer for everyone. One reason for this bound to appeal to conservatives is that immigrant neighborhoods have a higher proportion of two-parent families , which are better able to monitor the behavior of teenagers. All told, the growth of the foreign-born population in recent decades likely contributed to the significant reduction in violent and property crime seen in the U.S. between the early 1990s and the start of the pandemic.\n\nSome would argue that what really motivates conservative opposition to immigration is xenophobia and racism. This hypothesis might help explain why white evangelical Christians tend to be hostile to immigration, despite how important it's been for filling the pews: perhaps they prefer a version of Christianity with white pastors and congregants. Racism could also account for anti-immigrant sentiment in rural parts of the country that are desperate for more workers, and where it would manifestly be in people's economic interests to welcome newcomers with open arms.\n\nWhatever the motivation, conservative antipathy to immigration has long stood in the way of comprehensive immigration reform. The best hope for such reform (once the Ukraine aid stalemate is resolved) may be the Dignity Act , a thoughtful piece of legislation introduced earlier this year by Representative María Salazar, a moderate Republican from Florida, and Representative Veronica Escobar, a Democrat from Texas. The Dignity Act strengthens border security-with attention to humanitarian considerations-while expanding opportunities for legal immigration and offering pathways to legal residence for undocumented migrants. The bill has some bipartisan support and the backing of the US Chamber of Commerce but is effectively dead in the water because of opposition from the hard-right in the House.\n\nThat is a shame. If Republicans were to take another look at the facts, they might see that making America more immigrant-friendly isn't a capitulation to the left; it's the right thing to do.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Welcome to the Immigration Election\n\nThis article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME's politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox.\n\nThis could well be known among future historians as the Immigration Election.\n\nThe issue has overtaken all others as the top concern among voters, both in national polls and among those in the handful of states that are truly competitive battlegrounds. And among the up-for-grabs voters, President Joe Biden is at a pronounced disadvantage, according to new surveys released this week. As fears of migrant crime and overwhelmed communities dominate the zeitgeist in parts of this very divided country, former President Donald Trump finds himself better positioned.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal on Wednesday released a massive set of surveys from seven swing states and found very few reasons for Team Biden to feel upbeat. The Democratic coalition is visibly fraying, with substantial bleeding among Black and Latino voters, and younger voters. The gender gap, too, is showing a more suspicious audience among men in those swing states.\n\nBiden's biggest drag ? The border . As the number of people detained by U.S. border patrol has soared-most of them voluntarily surrendering rather than being apprehended-surveys now show immigration and border security as the most important topic that will decide the outcome of Election Day, topping the improving post-pandemic economy.\n\nRead more : Operation Save Biden\n\nThis, of course, didn't just happen overnight. Trump has steadily banged the drum on immigration dating to his first days as a candidate in 2015, seeking to sow fear by linking migration and crime, desipte native-born Americans actually having higher statistical rates of crime. Hardly a day goes by when Trump isn't lashing out at migrants who come into the United States illegally. In February, about 140,000 did so, according to officials, and Trump has been all too happy to cite those newcomers, often in dehumanizing terms, as an explanation for all that ails America.\n\n\"They're not humans. They're animals,\" Trump said this week in Michigan.\n\nBiden's boosters rightly argue that while Trump may have advantages in six of the seven states' polls, the former President is statistically leading in just two given the surveys' margin of error. In fact, North Carolina and Arizona are the only places where Trump's numbers are outside of the gray area, while Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin remain plausible toss-ups.\n\nWhile immigrations has influenced the outcome of past elections, it could be uniquely determinative in 2024. And the fact remains that a majority of voters simply do not trust Biden's approach to immigration and the border and, at least in those states, are looking at Trump's tough-guy image as a viable alternative. By a margin of roughly 20 points, voters in those swing states give Trump the advantage on the issue. And it's not just limited to immigration, either; Trump is notably ahead when voters are asked about inflation, the economy, mental and physical fitness to hold office, and to lesser degrees foreign policy. Only when voters are asked about abortion and broader threats to democracy does Biden rebound.\n\nStill, immigration remains a top issue-if not the most important topic-in this campaign. And when voters are asked to grade Biden's handling, it's a big red F; at least 72% of those polled in the swing states are saying immigration and border policies are going the wrong way. Put another way: Biden is flunking on the topic that is, at least in this moment, defining this election year.\n\nMake sense of what matters in Washington. Sign up for the D.C.

      "text": "7 Things That Would Fix Immigration in the U.S.\n\nW ith the Republican Party in such a chaotic state as evidenced by the recent battle over who will be Speaker, and the surreal saga surrounding George Santos , it is hard to predict how a Republican Congress will behave, and who will end up as their nominee for President. But as evidenced by the first \"investigation\" and hearings convened by the now Republican-controlled House Judiciary Committee-chaired by bomb-thrower Rep. Jim Jordan-around President Biden's handling of the Southern border, it is a sure thing that immigration will remain one of their favored wedge issues.\n\nWhether the President addresses it or not at his State of the Union message, you can bet the Republican responder will. Republican leaders trip over themselves in their eagerness to \"own the libs\" and excite resentment at the \"woke\" left.\n\nEfforts like those by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott to fly Venezuelan migrants (many of them asylum-seekers) to the progressive Democratic island of Martha's Vineyard, Mass., as well as busing migrants to Democratic cities of Chicago, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. (including to the residence of Vice-President Harris) are likely to continue so long as the actions breed continuous rewards on the right and the outrageousness of these actions is obscured by the fog of bitter partisan divides. In fact, Gov. DeSantis recently renewed his $12 million request for state budget funds for such purposes.\n\nUnderneath the cynical gamesmanship that treat migrants as mere props in the immigration debate-instead of as human beings and families desperately seeking freedom and opportunity, fleeing oppression, and pursuing the same American Dream as prior generations-is a false belief that immigration is an intractable problem that will plague the U.S. until draconian anti-immigrant policies (building a wall and shutting the border down, among other motions) are enacted.\n\nTrump's defeat and stronger than projected midterm performances by Democrats suggest that anti-immigrant cynicism is misplaced and a fundamental misread of American sentiments on immigration. Rather than feeling stymied by immigration as a political bogeyman, politicians can actually flip the script and make immigration a winning issue by pursuing real, common sense solutions to our immigration woes that are supported by large majorities of the voting public.\n\nThere are a number of solutions to immigration policy problems that have historically attracted bipartisan support-ranging from support for the so-called \"Dreamers,\" immigrants who arrived in the U.S. as children, expanding pathways high-skill immigrants and startup founders that our businesses and economy desperately need, and providing clearer pathways for our allies fleeing war and persecution in Afghanistan and Ukraine. Developing a clear and concrete position on immigration that actually solves problems and that draws significant public majority support is the surest way of winning the issue in the medium-term and long run, including in the context of the upcoming presidential campaign. which likely will feature competing Republicans eager to play to and stoke Americans' fear of immigrants.\n\nThe callous political stunts involved in every act of shipping migrants to other areas of the country pinpoint everything that's wrong with the politics of immigration . They only confirm the fact that Governors Abbott and DeSantis don't really want to solve the problems of a long-broken immigration system, but rather hope to keep drawing attention to the issue and hang the \"migrant invasion\" albatross around Democratic politician's necks. These actions certainly don't belie a legitimate effort to discuss whether current immigration policy needs fixing, and, if so, how to go about it.\n\nThe reality is that far from being divided, a solid American majority supports all the core elements of common-sense comprehensive immigration reform and has for some time. An October 2022 poll by fwd.us documents massive support for legislation that would create an earned path to citizenship for Dreamers and secure our southern border by a 50-point margin (71% support/21% oppose). This includes 58% support among Republican voters. Such polling results are affirmed by numerous other polls including a November 2022 CBS poll focusing on voters in key swing states of Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. It is time for leaders on both sides to stop being outraged-Democrats over the latest stunts of bussing migrants to northern cities and Republicans over any increase in border traffic-and start promoting the solutions that most Americans support.\n\nAdvocates for more robust immigration policy also have to get serious about the politics of immigration, learning how to talk about immigrants and immigration in a manner that doesn't enhance political opposition to policy reform, but that builds support for it. Rather than expressing outrage, those serious about immigration solutions need to diminish the demagoguery that is the current immigration debate. The debate needs to be framed to reveal and reflect the strong consensus majority view on the issue which can help it to politically carry and keep the day.\n\nThe immigration debate could unfold similarly to the contentious debate over health care in this country over recent decades. Understanding the broad dissatisfaction with a health care system in the 2000s plagued by double-digit inflationary costs and tens of millions of uninsured, President Obama and the Democrat Congress moved forward with historic health care reforms (dubbed Obamacare) based on core principles of reform. While Republicans misrepresented and demagogued the issue to massive midterm victories, good policy won out. Republicans could never muster the votes to repeal policies which seemingly stemmed rapidly rising costs and that covered tens of millions. The lesson of health care is that good policy can win in the end. It's not inconceivable that action on comprehensive immigration reform that is balanced sensible-similar to the actions to address the health care crisis through the Affordable Care Act-could make immigration a winning issue for politicians that move forward on the issue.\n\nIn fact, many Americans are concerned about immigration problems-most notably the seemingly endless flow of migrants at the southern border-and they want something done about it. By insisting on enforcing immigration laws and fair treatment for all and stepping up to actually fix the problem, immigration advocates can put the anti-immigrant, xenophobic crowd on the defensive.\n\nAdvocates must develop messaging that avoids putting immigrants on a pedestal, and that builds support for immigration reform for the promise it provides to our nation's and local community's economic prosperity. Comprehensive immigration reform and advocacy must be rooted in values of fairness, security, freedom, and opportunity. Messages rooted in outrage at anti-immigrant gamesmanship or that calls for open borders or \"sanctuary cities,\" which (as noble and moral as the policy is designed to be) is heard by many Americans as granting special treatment for undocumented entrants, and as fostering a spirit that rewards rule breakers.\n\nThe current system is broken and doesn't work. It doesn't work for border communities that feel the chaos and that have to deal with the newcomers. It doesn't work for those seeking refuge and fleeing persecution, natural disasters ,and war. Nor does the system work for those looking for freedom and opportunity in America. And it certainly doesn't work to help America be more economically competitive.\n\nPro-immigration advocates should lead with comprehensive immigration reform as a way to restore order to our immigration system. In fact, bipartisan majorities exist for key elements of immigration reform that include:\n\nWe must provide a means for immigrant adults who have labored in the U.S., paid taxes, and otherwise contributed to our nation to emerge from the shadows and join the formal economy. Particularly, strong support is seen for those that are doing essential jobs, as well as jobs others don't want to do: nurses, elder care, farm workers, and meatpackers to name a few. If we did allow immigrants to help fill these jobs, it would actually help diminish one of today's top concerns: inflation. Employing immigrant communities reduces inflationary pressures as critical workers in short supply drive up wages in key sectors, and further tie up supply chains.\n\nMillions of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients, or \"Dreamers,\" are already making contributions to our society as workers, taxpayers, and solid citizens. Beyond DACA-eligible residents, immigration reform should provide a pathway to citizenship for \"documented dreamers.\" These are children of the foreign workers that have legally admitted to the U.S. on temporary work visas, such as the H-1B visa used by skilled technology workers. Documented Dreamers lose their legal status upon turning 21 despite being welcomed at the time of their entrance to the country. Nearly a quarter million children who grew up while legally residing in the U.S. now face deportation upon turning 21, despite being educated here In the U.S. and having little, if any, knowledge of or connection to their countries of birth. Because they entered the U.S. legally, these promising bright minds do not qualify for DACA and need new statutory provisions in the law to resolve their immigration issues.\n\nSkilled immigrants have powered America's innovation economy , create new businesses and put more Americans to work . Additional smart policies would expand the number of H-1B visas-a program that routinely receives more than three or four times the number of applications than slots allowed annually. Further developing the program would enable immigration officials to punish companies that abuse the program and provide more resources for the federal government to more efficiently and effectively manage the program.\n\nA version of the startup visa recently passed in the U.S. House as part of the CHIPs Act, which is designed to reboot American economic competitiveness, and enable founders of high-growth companies from around the world to launch their business in America. These visas are similar to the startup visa that Canada, Australia, Chile, and other nations have created, as they're eager to host the next Google, Intel, Uber, and PayPal startups of tomorrow. (In fact, already all of those companies- and 55% of the 582 U.S. startup companies that are now valued at over $1 billion -have immigrant founders or co-founders.)\n\nWe also need to create further pathways for international students to receive degrees from U.S. universities, enter the U.S. workforce, and remain in it for longer periods of time. Recent research by the Economic Innovations Group documents solid majorities among Republicans (66%), Democrats (83%), and Independents (70%) supporting policies that expand the number of skilled immigrants.\n\nImmigrants to the U.S. overwhelmingly want to live out American ideals and come to the U.S. for opportunity and freedom. Immigrants make communities more sustainable and more vibrant. But too often the costs and process for immigration borne locally are uncompensated. Federal support and direction to facilitate integration can indeed help aid communities, refugee resettlement hubs, and other communities experiencing rapid immigration growth. In addition to providing federal financial support and guidance, a White House Office for New Americans would go a long way to setting and implementing comprehensive integration policies to help local communities welcome newcomers.\n\nWithout adequate money for federal immigration judges, asylum cases are backlogged. Without appropriate funding for immigration officials at USCIS, international students can waste valuable months waiting for the administrative processing of practical training opportunities. Appropriate funding of our immigration system would provide resources for border security, but more impactfully, it would enable the system to work more efficiently and effectively, ending the practice of having to house immigrants waiting on immigration courts.\n\nFinally, we need to accompany comprehensive immigration reform with much more aggressive anti-corruption efforts abroad and international economic development aid and infrastructure building to address root causes of immigration. The U.S. must proactively work to curtail the violence, corruption, poverty, and lack of good job opportunities abroad that drive migrants to make the incredibly arduous and dangerous journeys to the U.S. as better alternatives to staying in their home countries.\n\nWith asylum-seekers massing at the border and the future of the Trump-era Title 42 border policy keeping them out in limbo, the moment screams for comprehensive immigration reform. Without a clear platform, solution and plan of action on the immigration issue on the part of Democrats, Republicans who don't really want to fix immigration problems, but demagogue the issue, will continue to get a pass.\n\nIf immigration advocates can start sending the right message on immigration reform, along with concrete package of proposals to fix the real problems, they might turn the table on the game-players and their stunts and get something done.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "'It's Going to Take Everyone': How Immigrant Advocates Are Preparing for Trump's Return\n\nF or immigrant advocates, legal services, and rights groups, the threat of anti-immigrant rhetoric and legislation is not new. Earlier this year, the Biden Administration was sued by several groups, including the National Immigrant Justice Center and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) over an executive order which severely restricted asylum claims at the U.S.-Mexico border.  President-elect Donald Trump's first term was defined by harsh immigration tactics, including family separation and a travel ban that barred people from some predominantly Muslim countries from entering the U.S.\n\n\"It's been a long four years. It's been a really long eight years,\" says Keren Zwick, litigation director at the National Immigrant Justice Center.\n\nBut 2025 will bring a marked escalation for these groups and the people they serve. With Trump's return to office looms the promise of a sweeping overhaul of the country's immigration policies, which could include mass deportation, workplace raids, expanding the border wall, bringing back the \"Remain in Mexico\" policy (which requires migrants who crossed into the U.S. through the southern border to remain in Mexico while their asylum cases were heard), and ending birthright citizenship, or the longstanding principle that children born in the U.S. are granted citizenship.\n\n\"What we're expecting are drastic changes announced immediately,\" says Jennifer Babaie, director of advocacy and legal services at Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center, which provides free and low-cost legal services to migrants and refugees.\n\nHere are some ways that Babaie, Zwick, and immigrant advocates across the country are preparing for Trump's return to power.\n\nBoth in the U.S. and in shelters in Tijuana, immigration advocates have been already providing groups \"Know Your Rights'\" presentations that help migrants understand what is expected of them by border officials, including what will happen in credible fear interviews.\n\nWhen asylum-seekers enter the United States, they are referred to U.S. border officials who conduct a credible fear interview (CFI), in which the official determines whether the migrant seeking asylum has a \"credible fear\" of returning to their home country.\n\nBabaie says Las Americas is working to expand these presentations to broader groups, and to include more information to not just those on the border looking to enter the country, but those already in the interior who are at risk of deportation.\n\n\"What we're incorporating into these presentations is safety planning,\" she said. \"Your family should know their status. Everyone should know where their documents are. You need to know if a person gets picked up, who is your emergency contact, and how do your kids know who to update.\"\n\nFor Melissa Shepard, directing attorney at Immigrant Defenders Law Center (ImmDef), her team has similar priorities. Sheperd oversees ImmDef's Welcoming Project in San Diego, and says that one thing her team is doing is transferring their rights presentations to their website, and translating them into multiple languages-including more indigenous languages-in order to reach wider immigrant communities.\n\nBabaie says this is the time communities need to come together, not in spite of the fear of a second Trump Administration but because of it.\n\n\"[Community] is our only way to survive,\" she says. \"Or else, we're writing a million reports. If no one's reading them, no one cares. And then, that's how we get used to losing our rights.\"\n\nAccording to Norma Chávez-Peterson, the executive director of ACLU of San Diego & Imperial Counties, this means going beyond just informing immigrants and their families of their rights.\n\n\"It's going to really require everyone, immigrant rights organizations, local government, state government, anybody, everybody and their mother that cares and values and wants to protect immigrants,\" Chávez-Peterson said. She and her ACLU affiliate have been meeting with different local and state officials, including California's attorney general and governor's offices. California Governor Gavin Newsom has already announced a special session on Nov. 7, which in part will be to bolster resources for immigrant families. Chávez-Peterson sees San Diego as a model for other cities on the border to look towards for that kind of multilevel cooperation.\n\nChávez-Peterson also emphasized that, as an immigrant herself, she sees how immigrants in the country feel that they \"have a huge target on their back\" and are operating with fear. If threatened, immigrants might not immediately go to the ACLU for help, but rather to their trusted places, including their faith community, their social workers, their teachers, their schools. So, Chávez-Peterson says it's up to groups like hers to bring information there.\"If ICE goes to look for somebody at a school, how do we make sure that those schools have a policy that they can't share parent information?\" she says.\n\nThat also means groups across the country have already begun sharing information with one another.  Both Babaie and Chávez-Peterson have attended panels, trainings and conferences recently with other advocacy and legal groups, and say these are important for communication on what policies are actually being implemented so they can be utilized immediately.\n\n\"[During the first Trump Administration], policies were being implemented without any announcement whatsoever,\" Babaie said. \"And so then the only way attorneys were figuring out what exactly was happening was through word of mouth, not through FOIAs or announcements from the administration.\"\n\nThough Trump has made some of his potential policy initiatives clear, immigrant advocates are also preparing to expect the unexpected.\n\nPart of that preparation for Chávez-Peterson includes revitalizing the San Diego Rapid Response Network , which includes a hotline, free legal deportation defense, and other nonprofits, all pulled together in collaboration to help families that are caught up in deportation crises.\n\n\"When the family's in crisis, the last thing that you want to do is give them a list with numbers to call yes and get bounced around from organization to organization,\" she says.\n\nBabaie also emphasizes that this means preparing teams-teams already exhausted from the legal battles of the past eight years-for the battles ahead.\n\n\"We're all going to have to move to a more procedural and detail-oriented way of working, because in the last time we had the Trump presidency, we were getting denials because of something like a space was left blank on a form,\" she said.\n\nThe most important message though, she says, is to let both immigrant communities and the government know that groups like Las Americas are there, and they are ready: \"Part of our obligation is to maintain that we're going to keep doing what we do. And no matter what you throw at us, we're just going to turn around and find a way to still use our legal practice to defend these people.\"\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

There's a Better Way\n\nF rom the sands of the Sahel to the waters of the Mediterranean, from the wilderness of the Darien in Central America to the Bay of Bengal, millions of refugees and migrants journey along routes that are synonymous with desperation, exploitation and lost lives. As the heads of the two U.N. agencies that protect and support people on the move, we believe this is one of the great global challenges of our time.\n\nThe loudest political response has been to claim that only tougher action can resolve it. Most recently, a number European states have announced  plans to \"offshore\" or simply deport asylum seekers and/or make conditions around immigration and asylum more hostile.\n\nSuch plans are increasingly in vogue. They are also wrong. They overly concentrate on deterrence, control and law enforcement, and disregard the fundamental right to seek asylum. This approach is ineffective and irresponsible, leaving people stranded or compelling them to take even greater risks.\n\nWe do not want to understate the scale of the challenge created by today's population movements. But to meet it, bigger thinking and bolder leadership are needed. The right strategy would tackle every stage of the journey, through a comprehensive and route-based approach of engagement. So, what should such a strategy look like?\n\nFirst, we need to address the issues that compel people to leave home in the first place. Resolving conflicts, improving security, reinforcing human rights, providing sustained and reliable financial support to boost growth and resilience-all address the root causes of displacement and migration by investing in people's futures. Failing to make these investments and cutting development aid are false economies.\n\nNonetheless, millions of people have no choice but to leave home-protracted conflicts, widescale rights abuses, intolerable poverty, and the devastating effects of climate change are just some of the causes. Yet the same point applies: offer hope and opportunity and people will take it.\n\nWhen it comes to receiving refugees and migrants, it is the world's lowest-income states that are often the most generous, but they are hard-pressed to include yet more people in their national systems. In turn, this generates onward movement-without work, education, healthcare and housing, who would not want to keep looking for better things?\n\nTo counter this, wealthy states and international financial institutions should provide countries along these routes with the resources they need, thus also benefiting host communities. Schools, universities, businesses, markets, trade, environmental projects ... these are opportunities for everyone, but only if enough of them exist.\n\nWealthy states can also do more at home. The number of resettlement places and alternative paths to third countries for refugees and migrants is comparatively tiny. Visas for family reunification, education or work, seasonal employment opportunities, and access to private sponsorship programmes all provide safe, orderly ways to channel mixed movements and provide alternatives to irregular travel. Scaled up, they can have a real impact.\n\nBetter management of migration would have multiple advantages. First, it would help to meet employment gaps in wealthy countries, who need this more than many people realise. Labour shortages cost businesses $1.3 trillion a year, and will only get bigger as populations age across the Global North, while 90% of people aged 10-24 live in developing countries.\n\nSecond, creating some order in this sector would reduce pressure on asylum systems, with fewer migrants seeing them as the only option for entering a country legally. A comprehensive route-based approach would have one other huge plus: restricting opportunities for criminal traffickers by reducing the pool of people whose desperation they feed on.\n\nBut this is not just about policies and strategies. It means engaging more closely with the people in mixed movements, such as offering practical and legal advice on accessing protection, to guidance on applying for third-country options. Such a chain of engagement might require new, bespoke models of collaboration but, if done strategically, would address a range of situations.\n\nIt would also include fair, efficient, and modern asylum and protection systems at the journey's end, as well as in transit countries. Receiving states can only gain from this: it would let them clear backlogs, deal humanely and legally with refugees and vulnerable migrants, and enable the swift return in safety and dignity of those found not to be in need of protection or who do not have another basis to remain.\n\nTo be clear, all those who arrive at borders in search of safety must be granted territorial access to seek asylum. Denial of this right, or \"offshoring\" asylum seekers to third countries or other territories, are violations of international law and acts of cruelty.\n\nTwo ingredients are essential for our proposals to succeed: cooperation and real responsibility-sharing between governments, even in these divisive times; and attention to every part of the journey. An approach focused mainly on deterrence will fail-indeed, it is already failing.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "A Massive Immigration Courts Backlog Could Slow Trump's Deportation Plans\n\nO n the campaign trail, Donald Trump promised to launch the \"largest deportation\" in American history. But actually getting that done will require billions of dollars to hire thousands of new federal workers and pay for new spaces to hold those waiting to be deported. But perhaps most daunting will be another obstacle: moving through a massive backlog in immigration court cases.\n\nBefore a person in the U.S. can be deported, U.S. law requires they have a final order of removal issued by an immigration court. Those courts have been underfunded and understaffed for years, leading to wait times for a decision that stretch for years.\n\nCurrently there are 3.6 million cases pending before immigration judges, the largest number of such cases in the history of the American immigration system. That is a 44% increase from the 2.5 million cases pending the year before. And the problem is only getting bigger, as more people continue to be put into deportation proceedings.\n\nGroups that support Trump's effort to reduce immigration levels also want more immigration judges on the bench. Eric Ruark, the director of research for NumbersUSA, an organization that advocates for slashing legal immigration levels, says Congress needs to fund an expansion of the immigration courts to clear the backlog and speed up the issuance of removal orders. Congress has to \"step up\" and ensure that Immigration and Customs Enforcement \"has the resources, that we have detention space, that we have immigration judges who can deal with these cases,\" says Ruark.\n\nThe immigration courts aren't part of the judicial branch. They're housed within the Department of Justice and run from an obscure corner of the bureaucracy called the Executive Office for Immigration Review in the Justice. That office oversees about 700 immigration judges who decide who gets deported. Given its mandate, that office has been anemically funded for decades as Congress after Congress have deadlocked on reforming the country's inefficient and sclerotic immigration system.\n\nRead more : Trump Is Banned From Separating Families at the Border Again. Will He Fight It?\n\nJohn Sandweg, who was the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during the Obama administration, says more immigration judges and support staff would be needed if Trump wants to speed up deportations. It can take years to order someone deported and in the meantime, the person waiting for the decision gets to continue living in the U.S. \"The problem is also because in the 3, 4, 5, 6 years that they're going through the system, they're just more deeply integrated into U.S. society and everything then becomes politically much harder for ICE to deport.\"\n\nAdding judges to address the backlog was part of the bipartisan immigration deal that President Biden and Congress were preparing to pass earlier this year before Trump came out against it. The first item listed in the Senate version of the $8 billion bill was $440 million to hire more immigration judges.\n\nWhen Trump comes into office next month, he'll be inheriting an agency that is already deporting people at the highest rate in a decade. Immigration officers deported 271,484 immigrants during the final fiscal year of the Biden administration, which ended on Sept. 30. That is the highest level of deportations since 2014 during the Obama administration, according to data released this month.\n\nTrump's team is preparing actions to further boost deportations within his first weeks in office. Republicans will control both the House and the Senate, and incoming Trump officials want Congress to act immediately to add more border agents and immigration officers.\n\nStephen Miller, Trump's incoming White House deputy chief of staff, told Fox News's Maria Bartiromo on Dec. 8 that the bill would include funding to hire more ICE officers and border agents, and pay them both better. There would also be funding to increase the number of people who can be held in detention centers, Miller said. Trump has also not ruled out deploying the military to help with his deportation surge, an expansion of the military's role on U.S. soil that would test the limits of presidential power.\n\nThe deportation system moves faster for people held in custody. The cases of those held in detention are placed on the \"detained docket\" and those cases are heard more quickly. That is one motivation for Trump's advisors to increase the number of people in the U.S. who are arrested and held by immigration officers.\n\nCurrently ICE has funding to hold a maximum of 40,000 people in detention centers. Trump's choice for border czar, Tom Homan, told CNN on Dec. 18 that he would need Congress to approve funding for at least 100,000 detention beds, as well as more ICE agents, to increase deportations. \"We want to arrest as many people as we can that are in the country illegally,\" Homan told CNN.\n\nThe Biden administration instructed immigration officers to focus deportation efforts on people who pose national security or public safety risks. Of those deported in the previous year, about 32% had criminal histories, according to ICE data. Homan says deporting those people will be his priority too, but he intends to cast a wider net, putting people into removal proceedings who ICE finds but who don't pose an immediate threat.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Six big immigration changes under Trump - and their impact so far\n\nSince taking office on 20 January, President Donald Trump has announced a flurry of immigration-related executive orders, paving way for a widespread effort to crack down on undocumented migrants in the US.\n\nIn more than 21 actions, Trump has moved to overhaul parts of the US immigration system, including how migrants are processed and deported from the US.\n\nThe White House has since publicised some of these efforts. On Friday, the new White House Press Secretary shared images of deportation flights being carried out by military cargo planes.\n\nWhile Trump has promised \"mass deportations\" and arrests, it remains unclear how much of his plan is already being implemented.\n\nHere is a breakdown of some of the significant actions taken by Trump on immigration in his first week, and how they compare to past policies.\n\nA cornerstone of Trump's immigration policy is removing unlawful migrants out of the US and the promise of \"mass deportations\".\n\nTo that effect, the defence department has said that it will provide military aircraft to deport more than 5,000 people that have been detained by Border Patrol in San Diego and El Paso, Texas.\n\nICE statistics show that over 1,000 people were removed or repatriated on Thursday, the fourth day of the Trump administration.\n\nBorder czar Tom Homan has vowed that the deportations would increase steadily going forward.\n\nOver the weekend, Trump's deportation flights caused a brief diplomatic spat after Colombia's government barred two military planes carrying Colombians deported from the US from landing.\n\nThe country's president, Gustavo Petro, said that \"the US can't treat Colombian migrants like criminals\" and that they need to be \"treated with dignity\".\n\nHis government, however, appears to have agreed to accept the flights after the Trump administration threatened Colombia with punitive tariffs.\n\nTrump has also moved to expand the scope of expedited deportations of undocumented migrants, reviving a policy under his first term that Biden had discontinued.\n\nExpedited removals were previously limited to areas within 100 miles (160km) of US international borders, and applied to those who did not request asylum or failed to show a legitimate case for asylum.\n\nWith Trump's changes, these removals can now occur anywhere in the US, and will apply to undocumented migrants who can't prove that they have been in the country for more than two years.\n\nDeportations are not unique to the Trump administration.\n\nBiden carried out deportations as well, with 271,000 immigrants deported to 192 countries in fiscal year 2024.\n\nIn total, Biden carried out 1.5 million deportations in his four years, according to figures by the Migration Policy Institute. That is around the same that was carried out under Trump's first term.\n\nThat number is lower than deportations carried out under Barack Obama's first term, which added up to a total of 2.9 million.\n\nThe Pentagon announced on Wednesday the deployment of 1,500 active duty troops to the southern US border. This is in addition to 2,500 active-duty personnel already there, officials said - marking a 60% increase in Army troops in the area.\n\nThe troops will fly helicopters to help Border Patrol agents with monitoring, said acting Defense Secretary Robert Salesses. They will also help in the construction of barriers to stop migrants from coming in.\n\nSalesses signalled that \"this is just the beginning\" and more troops may be sent soon.\n\nOfficials added that a number of additional \"border enforcement missions\" are in development, without providing specifics.\n\nBiden also deployed active-duty troops to the border, which were used to assist Border Patrol with primarily administrative tasks ahead of the expiration of Title 42, a public health order that was used to expel migrants quickly during Covid-19.\n\nBorder crossings significantly dropped in Biden's final year as president. In December 2024 - the last full month of the Biden administration - about 47,330 migrant apprehensions were recorded, down from a high of nearly 250,000 in December 2023.\n\nThe figures are lower than the monthly averages in Trump's first term, before the Covid-19 pandemic.  In May 2019, for example, border patrol agents recorded 132,800 migrant encounters.\n\nIn an executive order, Trump suspended the entry of all undocumented migrants to the US, and border patrol agents have been instructed to turn people away without granting them asylum hearings.\n\nBefore the order, migrants were able to arrive at the US border and had the legal right to seek asylum.\n\nIn June 2024, however, the Biden administration issued its own executive order that temporarily suspended the right to seek asylum for those who did not arrive at an official point of entry, or without an appointment using CBP One, a mobile application. In September, asylum restrictions were tightened further.\n\nTrump has also halted the US refugee resettlement programme. Under Biden in 2024, the US accepted more than 100,000 refugees - its highest since 1995.\n\nHe also ended a major Biden-era programme that allowed up to 30,000 migrants per month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela to fly into the US on humanitarian grounds.\n\nThe \"Remain in Mexico\" policy from Trump's first-term will be reinstated as well. This forced non-Mexican asylum seekers to wait in Mexico until their asylum claims in the US were resolved. It impacted around 71,000 people under Trump's first term.\n\nThe controversial policy was regularly criticised by immigration advocates, who said that the migrants were often left in Mexico for months and sometimes were preyed upon by criminal gangs.\n\nThere is an estimated backlog of 3.6m cases in US immigration courts, and migrants often have to wait years. Many have been left wondering whether those cases will still be heard.\n\nTrump has fired several top immigration court officials since taking office, however, which may impact the processing of those cases.\n\nA big change that was felt almost immediately after Trump took office is the scrapping of the CBP One smartphone app, which migrants were able to use to schedule appointments with US border patrol agents.\n\nThe CBP One app was launched by the Biden administration as a way to organise and streamline the entry of migrants who are fleeing prosecution.\n\nSome 30,000 people were said to be stranded inside Mexico since the app was taken down - all of them with scheduled appointments that are now cancelled.\n\nAbout 270,000 migrants were estimated to be on the Mexican side of the border waiting to get appointments through the app, according to government figures obtained by CBS, the BBC's US partner.\n\nThe move was met with anguish by migrants who had travelled long journeys to the border, and who had waited months to secure those appointments.\n\nAdvocates say that, with its removal, there is now no practical pathway to protection for arriving migrants.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union has since filed a legal challenge against the app's closure.\n\nMexico is anticipating an influx of migrants from Trump's deportation orders, and has started building giant tent shelters in nine border cities to temporarily house them.\n\nMunicipal official Enrique Licon of Ciudad Juárez - a city that borders El Paso, Texas - told Reuters that these shelters will be able to house thousands of people and should be ready in a few days, calling the effort \"unprecedented\".\n\nThe shelters will provide people food, medical care and assistance in getting identification documents. A fleet of buses will also be at the ready to help transport Mexicans back to their hometowns.\n\nIt is part of a larger effort called \"Mexico Embraces You\", a government-wide campaign to welcome citizens who may be deported from the US and help them reintegrate in their home country.\n\nOther nearby nations - like Guatemala - are launching similar efforts to absorb their  deportees.\n\nBut some have raised concerns about whether Mexico and others will be ready to handle the number of people that may be coming their way.\n\nMany of the migrants are also fleeing political turmoil or criminal violence in their home countries, raising questions about whether they'll be safe if they return.\n\nSome of Trump's executive orders were signed with the aim of expanding Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) ability to arrest and detain unlawful migrants on US soil.\n\nOne of them reverses a longstanding guideline that prohibited immigration raids in areas deemed \"sensitive\", such as schools, hospitals and churches.\n\nAnother calls for an expansion of a programme that allows ICE to delegate its immigration enforcement duties to state and local police.\n\nIt remains unclear how many raids have taken place since Inauguration Day, but on 26 January alone 956 people were arrested by ICE and other agencies in locations including Chicago, Newark, New Jersey and Miami.\n\nFor comparison, ICE detained more than 149,700 in the 2024 fiscal year under the Biden administration, which equals an average of 409 a day.\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nThe US president says he fears the Russian leader is \"tapping me along\" given Moscow's strikes on Kyiv earlier this week.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Trump revoking protections for Cubans, Haitians and other migrants\n\nUS President Donald Trump's administration has said it will revoke the temporary legal status of more than half a million migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.\n\nThose migrants have been warned to leave the country before their permits and deportation shield are cancelled on 24 April, according to a notice posted by the federal government.\n\nThe 530,000 migrants were brought into the US under a Biden-era sponsorship process known as CHNV that was designed to open legal migration pathways. Trump suspended the programme once he took office.\n\nIt is unclear how many of these migrants have been able to secure another status in the interim that would allow them to stay in the US legally.\n\nThe programme was launched under Democratic President Joe Biden in 2022, first covering Venezuelans before it was expanded to other countries.\n\nIt allowed the migrants and their immediate family members to fly into the US if they had American sponsors and remain for two years under a temporary immigration status known as parole.\n\nThe Biden administration had argued that CHNV would help curb illegal crossings at the southern US border and allow for better vetting of those entering the country.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security on Friday rebuked the prior administration and said the programme had failed in its goals.\n\nThe agency's statement said Biden officials had \"granted them [migrants] opportunities to compete for American jobs and undercut American workers; forced career civil servants to promote the programs even when fraud was identified; and then blamed Republicans in Congress for the chaos that ensued and the crime that followed\".\n\nHowever, the 35-page notice in the Federal Register said some of those in the US under CHNV might be allowed to remain on a \"case-by-case basis\".\n\nKaren Tumlin, founder of the Justice Action Center in California, said her organisation is set to challenge the move in court.\n\nShe told the BBC the decision hurt people \"who did everything right that the US Government asked of them\", adding that \"their sponsors in the United States paid the fees, filled out the government paperwork, waited in line\".\n\n\"To say 'oh, we're so sorry, even if you had 18 months left on your grant of permission to be here we're going to pull the rug out from under you in the next 30 days,' it's really quite surprising.\"\n\nTrump is also considering whether to cancel the temporary legal status of some 240,000 Ukrainians who fled to the US during the conflict with Russia.\n\nCHNV helped a reported 213,000 Haitians enter the US amid deteriorating conditions in the Caribbean country.\n\nMore than 120,700 Venezuelans, 110,900 Cubans and over 93,000 Nicaraguans were also allowed into the US under the programme before Trump shut it down.\n\nLast month, DHS announced it would in August end another immigration designation, temporary protected status (TPS), for 500,000 Haitians living in the US.\n\nTPS was granted to nationals of designated countries facing unsafe conditions, such as armed conflict or environmental disasters.\n\nDHS also halted TPS for Venezuelans in the US, although this is facing a legal challenge.\n\nSince taking office in January, Trump's immigration policies have encountered a number of legal hurdles.\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nThe US president says he fears the Russian leader is \"tapping me along\" given Moscow's strikes on Kyiv earlier this week.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

The newly revised total for that period was 906,000 , far higher than the previous estimate of 740,000.\n\nThe ONS estimates that 1.2 million people expecting to stay at least a year came to the UK in the year to June 2024. It estimates that 479,000 left the UK.\n\nThe ONS figures show that of the 1.2 million people who came to live in the UK in the 12 months to June 2024:\n\nOf the 1.0 million non-EU+ nationals who came:\n\nAmong non-EU+ migrants, the most common nationality coming to the UK for both work-related (116,000) and study-related (127,000) reasons was Indian.\n\nAccording to separate Home Office figures, 393,125 student visas were issued to foreign students in the year ending December 2024.\n\nThat is 14% fewer than in the previous 12-month period, but still almost 50% higher (46%) than in 2019.\n\nIn the year to December 2024, 21,978 visas were issued to student dependants, an 85% fall from the number issued in 2023.\n\nSince January 2024, international postgraduate students have not been able bring dependants unless their course is a research programme.\n\nStudents who have already completed their degree can stay in the UK for two years - three years for those with a doctoral degree - to work under a graduate visa.\n\nMost people wanting to work in the UK still have to apply for a visa through the points-based system (PBS).\n\nBut since 11 April 2024, they have needed a job offer with a higher salary.\n\nApplicants have to earn at least £38,700 - an increase of nearly 50% from the previous £26,200 minimum.\n\nThe threshold does not apply to some jobs - such as in health and social care, and teachers on national pay scales.\n\nAnnouncing the new rules, the-then Conservative Home Secretary James Cleverly claimed that 300,000 people who were eligible to come to the UK in 2022 would no longer qualify .\n\nAt the time, groups including the CBI and the Royal College of Nursing criticised the changes for failing to address the UK's labour shortages.\n\nYou need a family visa if you want to live with a relative who is a British citizen, or someone who has the right to be in the UK for more than six months.\n\nThe latest Home Office figures showed that 86,000 family-related visas were granted in the year ending December 2024, 7% more than in 2023.\n\nYou can apply to live with your:\n\nYou have to demonstrate a good knowledge of English. The relative that you will live with in the UK has to meet the minimum income threshold.\n\nThis was initially also due to rise to £38,700 - a sharp increase from the previous £18,600 figure.\n\nBut after warnings the new rules risked separating families, the previous government dropped the new minimum to £29,000 .\n\nAnyone renewing an existing family visa does not have to meet the new earnings threshold.\n\nThe Home Office statistics showed that 27,000 visas were issued to people coming to the UK to work in health and social care in the 12 months to December 2024.\n\nThis is a fall of 81% compared with the previous 12 months. The number coming to work in the sector had increased significantly after temporary changes to the health and care visa rules .\n\nIn the year ending December 2024, there were approximately three dependants for each person coming to do a job in health and social care.\n\nHowever, the number of dependants fell sharply in the last 10 months of the period, after the previous Conservative government changed the rules to stop international social care workers bringing their children or partners with them.\n\nApplicants need 70 points to qualify for a skilled worker visa. This can last for up to five years before it needs to be extended.\n\nYou get 50 points from having a job offer above a minimum skill level, and speaking English.\n\nThe remaining 20 points can come from a higher salary, working in a sector with job shortages, or having a relevant PhD.\n\nThe standard fee for a skilled visa is usually between £719 and £1,639, depending on your circumstances.\n\nVisa applicants also have to pay a healthcare surcharge for each year of their stay.\n\nThe amount can vary - but since April 2024, the standard fee has been £1,035 per year, up from £624.\n\nThe immigration salary list replaced what was previously called the shortage occupation list.\n\nIt helps employers fill vacancies in key sectors.\n\nThese jobs have a lower salary threshold making it easier for applicants to gain enough points to get a visa.\n\nThe list includes:\n\nEmployers used to be able to pay foreign workers 80% of the usual \"going rate\" to fill these positions.\n\nBut this lower rate was abolished for people applying after 4 April 2024.\n\nTemporary workers such as fruit pickers and poultry workers are covered by seasonal worker visas , subject to an annual quota.\n\nThere were 35,561 seasonal worker visas issued in the year to December 2024.\n\nMore than three-quarters of these (78%) were from Central Asian countries, such as Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan .\n\nFor 2025, the quota is 47,000 :\n\nSeasonal workers can stay in the UK for up to six months for horticultural work, and from 2 October to 31 December each year for poultry work.\n\nThey cannot accept a permanent job or bring family members with them.\n\nAn application costs £298.\n\nWorkers must be paid the relevant national minimum wage.\n\nBefore Brexit, EU and UK citizens had the freedom to live, work or study in any EU country without needing a visa.\n\nHowever, this freedom of movement ended on 1 January 2021 when the UK left the EU.\n\nIn the 12 months to June 2024, the ONS figures showed that net migration for non-EU nationals - the difference between those arriving and those leaving - was 845,000.\n\nIn the same period, net EU migration was -95,000, meaning 95,000 more EU nationals left the UK than arrived.\n\nNet migration of British nationals was -21,000, meaning more British people left the UK than came back.\n\nThe reversal comes as US immigration officials work out a new system for reviewing and revoking students visas.\n\nAn agreement has emerged as a key European demand in ongoing negotiations for a post-Brexit \"reset\".\n\nThe move is part of the government's plan to curb undocumented migration from neighbouring Haiti.\n\nA team of Democratic lawmakers have met with two students who are currently in immigration detention in Louisiana.\n\nThe accused gang members are being sent to a notorious jail in El Salvador under a 19th-Century law.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Trump declares border emergency and seeks to end US birthright citizenship\n\nFrom behind his desk in the Oval Office, President Donald Trump signed a flurry of executive orders and decrees aimed at cracking down on immigration.\n\nFrom one order tackling the definition of birthright citizenship, to another declaring illegal immigration at the border a national emergency, Trump swiftly made moves on his promises to tighten the US-Mexico border.\n\nBut some of his plans - particularly around changing the definition of birthright citizenship - are likely to face significant hurdles.\n\nHe is already facing legal challenges from immigration advocacy groups, which have reacted furiously to his announcements.\n\nOne organisation said his plans \"do not uphold American values\", and another said Trump's administration was \"actively trying to destroy our lives\".\n\nIn his inaugural address earlier in the day, Trump vowed that \"all illegal entry will be halted\" and that millions of \"criminal aliens\" would be deported.\n\nHe also signed an order declaring Mexican drug cartels terrorist organisations. \"I have no higher responsibility than to defend our country from threats and invasions,\" he explained.\n\nAt another event at Washington's Capital One Arena, Trump formally revoked nearly 80 executive actions of his predecessor Joe Biden. He had previously vowed to scrap Biden's policies \"within five minutes\".\n\nFollowing his inauguration, he also signed a proclamation that gave officials the authority to \"repel, repatriate, or remove\" migrants until he was satisfied that \"the invasion at the southern border has ceased\".\n\nAlthough the details of the order are not yet known, officials have said that Trump plans to end birthright citizenship.\n\nThat refers to an approach of the US government whereby anyone born on American soil is considered a citizen at birth, regardless of their parents' immigration status.\n\nTrump appears to be seeking to change the rules so that that the children of undocumented migrants living in the US will no longer automatically be considered US citizens. It would not apply retrospectively.\n\nExactly how he intends to achieve this is unclear, however, because birthright citizenship is enshrined in the constitution and would require a two-thirds vote in both chambers of Congress to change.\n\nTrump has instructed federal agencies to stop issuing documentation to children born in the US to parents who are in the country illegally or on temporary visas, which could effectively deny them access to public services.\n\nAdvocacy group the American Civil Liberties Union (ALCU) immediately said it was suing the Trump administration over the order. \"Denying citizenship to US-born children is not only unconstitutional - it's also a reckless and ruthless repudiation of American values,\" it said in a statement.\n\nThe new administration has also moved to swiftly scrap CBP One, a mobile application used by migrants to book appointments to appear at a port of entry.\n\nBiden administration officials had credited the app with helping reduce the number of detentions at the border since it was first introduced in January 2023. It was the only legal pathway to request asylum at the US-Mexico border.\n\nNow, the Customs and Border Protection website notes that the app is \"no longer available\".\n\nApp users also now are shown a message noting that \"existing appointments scheduled through CBP One are no longer valid\".\n\nAccording to CBS, the BBC's US partner, the Biden administration had scheduled roughly 30,000 appointments via CBP One for migrants to enter the US in the next three weeks.\n\nOther estimates had suggested that as many as 270,000 migrants were in Mexico waiting for an opportunity to enter the US using CBP One.\n\nIn the Mexican border city of Tijuana, some migrants reported feeling defeated and deflated after learning of CBP One's demise.\n\n\"I hope God touches his [Trump's] heart,\" said Oralia, a Mexican woman who fled cartel violence in her home state along with her epileptic son. \"We really do need the help.\"\n\nShe had been waiting for an appointment through CBP One for seven months.\n\nAmong his other day-one moves, Trump ordered a shutdown of another Biden-era initiative, which allowed up to 30,000 migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela to fly to the US per month. Like the CBP One app, it was designed to lower the number of illegal crossings.\n\nImmigration advocacy groups have reacted furiously to Trump's various orders.\n\nAs well as the criticism from the ACLU, the president and CEO of the National Immigration Forum said the orders were \"disappointing but not surprising\".\n\n\"The expected orders would separate families and weaken our economy,\" Jennie Murray's statement continued. \"They do not uphold American values.\"\n\nGreisa Martinez Rosas, the executive director of United We Dream - a national immigrant youth organisation - said that the orders show that the administration \"will spend the next four years actively trying to destroy our lives\".\n\n\"Trump's pledges to carry out mass raids and deportations will have devastating consequences on communities nationwide, leaving millions of families and individuals in disarray if immediate action is not taken by our elected officials to publicly fight back,\" she added.\n\n(With additional reporting from Will Grant in Mexico)\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nThe US president says he fears the Russian leader is \"tapping me along\" given Moscow's strikes on Kyiv earlier this week.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Trump says $5m 'gold card' immigration visas will 'sell like crazy'\n\nPresident Donald Trump has unveiled plans for selling a \"gold card\" visa for $5m (£3.9m) that will offer wealthy buyers permanent residency in the US and a path to citizenship.\n\nAt the first cabinet meeting of his current term, Trump told reporters that the visas would function similarly to green cards, which allow immigrants of varying incomes to live and work permanently in the US, but would go to  \"high-level people\".\n\n\"The people that can pay $5m, they're going to create jobs,\" Trump said. \"It's going to sell like crazy. It's a bargain.\"\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, also at the meeting, said the gold visas would replace the current visa programme for foreign investors, but offered few details.\n\nDozens of countries around the world offer some sort of citizenship by investment programme, including several in Europe, like Portugal, which gives \"golden visas\", or permanent residency for foreigners who invest €500,000 ($524,000) into a qualifying fund.\n\nTrump said companies would use the golden visa programme to hire non-citizens to work for them in the US.\n\n\"We have to be able to get people in the country, and we want people that are productive people,\" Trump said.\n\nTypically, green card holders in the US can apply for citizenship after five years.\n\nTrump suggested revenue from the high-priced visas could be used to pay off US debt.\n\nLutnick said that the initiative will replace the EB-5 visa, which gives permanent residency to some foreigners who invest around $1m and create at least 10 full-time jobs in the US.\n\nSaying the EB-5 programme was \"poorly overseen and poorly executed\",  Lutnick said the golden visas would be an improvement.\n\n\"We're going to make sure they're wonderful world-class global citizens,\" Lutnick said of future gold card applicants.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how the government would select recipients, if there were exclusions, or if there would be any cap on how many are issued.\n\nDuring the fiscal year of 2024, the State Department issued over 12,000 EB-5 visas, a record high for the programme.\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nThe prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein and the Duke of York has died at the age of 41.\n\nGiuffre alleged she was trafficked to the Duke of York when she was 17, which he has strenuously denied.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Irish immigrants in US: 'There is more of a fear element now'\n\nAbout 20 minutes from the White House, Chris Devenny and Michael McMahon are overseeing a steady trade on a Tuesday afternoon at the Celtic House, an Irish bar and restaurant in the suburbs of Washington DC.\n\nA dozen or so punters are being served pints of stout and lager by young women from Ireland who, like general manager Chris and managing director Michael, are living the American dream.\n\nBut the pair fear the route to permanent residency - and eventually citizenship - will not always be open to young people like it was to them.\n\nChris and Michael are both United States citizens. But for at least a while, they both lived there illegally.\n\nThey say the policies and rhetoric of President Donald Trump since his second term began in January are hanging over many Irish-Americans and not just those who are in the US illegally.\n\nTrump has pledged \"mass deportations\" of people who are in the US illegally and his term began with immigration raids, a halt on the processing of asylum seekers and undocumented migrants and executive orders aimed at expanding Immigration and Customs Enforcement's (ICE) ability to arrest and detain unlawful migrants.\n\n\"It used to be if you had a green card [permanent residency] you felt safe and you felt secure,\" says Chris, who is originally from Londonderry and first came to the US on a J-1 exchange visitor visa during the Obama years.\n\n\"Obviously within limits, you had to abide with the law, but I became a citizen in December because that safety net is going to be taken away.\n\n\"You could do something small or something stupid and it would all be taken away from you.\n\n\"There is more of a fear element now.\n\n\"If you come to America are you going to be able to make it and stay or are you going to be shipped back home?\"\n\nGreen cards allow people to live and work permanently in the US and, in most cases, their holders can apply for citizenship after five years.\n\nPresident Trump's policies have focused on undocumented migrants rather than green card holders.\n\nBut views from the Trump administration regarding illegal and undocumented migrants means many feel less secure in the US with a green card than in previous years.\n\nMichael first came to the US in 1987 on a holiday visa and was then in the country illegally before managing to gain permanent residency within 18 months.\n\n\"The mood then was totally different,\" he says.\n\n\"There is a big element of fear with people - going back a few years ago you'd have students coming over here working.\n\n\"The process is getting very difficult to do that now and then you say 'is it worth it?'\n\n\"Trying to get people over here on a visa and then trying to keep them here is difficult.\"\n\nLike Chris, Michael says there is a feeling that simply having permanent residency status is no longer the security it once was.\n\nWhen asked what he would say to those who disagree with people being in the US illegally, Chris says: \"It's a tough one, if you're coming here and you're going to be illegal - or anywhere in the world - there's going to be a risk.\"\n\nImmigration raids have stepped up since President Trump returned to office, while the US government has repurposed a mobile application - originally created to facilitate asylum appointments - into a way for undocumented migrants already in the US to \"self-deport\".\n\nDuring his election campaign, Trump said he wanted to make US borders \"strong and powerful\" and in 2024 he told Time magazine illegal migration was \"not a sustainable problem for our country\".\n\nDemocratic Party politicians have criticised the policies.\n\nOne representative, Adriana Espaillat, described raids in January as \"unwarranted\" and said they had \"not only targeted hardworking individuals but, alarmingly, have also wrongfully targeted U.S. citizens and veterans\".\n\nChicago-based immigration lawyer Fiona McEntee says she has seen a noticeable change in the atmosphere among immigrants, including Irish-Americans since before Trump's inauguration.\n\n\"You could just feel the anxiety in the immigrant community bubbling up and starting to rise,\" she says.\n\n\"It definitely has resulted in a huge amount of fear in the community.\"\n\nShe says there has been an impact on the broader Irish-American community beyond first-generation immigrants.\n\n\"Some people have empathy for what other people might be going through, those who for example might end up in ICE custody,\" Ms McEntee said.\n\n\"But it actually permeates down through different types of immigrants.\n\n\"For example, naturalised US citizens have expressed concerns and I know that we've received some calls from people who were concerned.\"\n\nThe number of undocumented Irish citizens in the US is difficult to establish, for obvious reasons.\n\nIn recent years, a figure of about 10,000 has often been quoted.\n\nThat is a tiny proportion of the estimated 11 million undocumented residents who were believed to be living in the US in 2022.\n\nMs McEntee says the majority of undocumented people are \"working, contributing to society and paying taxes\" and \"are not criminals\".\n\nSupporters of the Trump administration's policies, on the other hand, say illegal immigrants and the undocumented have broken the rules.\n\nThe president has described the passage of migrants across the southern border with Mexico as an \"invasion\".\n\nThe White House points to his comments in 2018 during his first term in office when he said illegal immigration \"affects the lives of all Americans\".\n\n\"Illegal immigration hurts American workers; burdens American taxpayers; and undermines public safety; and places enormous strain on local schools, hospitals, and communities in general, taking precious resources away from the poorest Americans who need them most,\" Trump has said.\n\nThe Irish-American community is large - with more than 31 million people claiming Irish descent.\n\nMany voted for Trump in November - in fact the president recently declared March Irish-American Heritage Month, saying the Irish were \"great people\" who voted for him \"in heavy numbers\".\n\nSusan Davis, president of Irish American Republicans, says while many people have strong views on illegal immigration, the issue of undocumented Irish immigrants simply did not matter to many Irish-American voters.\n\n\"There are parts of the US where it is more of an issue because there are many more undocumented Irish who have come over and so the Irish-American community there would be way more supportive of them.\n\n\"To be quite honest in the midwest or in the south for example it is less of an issue.\n\n\"People don't think about undocumented Irish, they think about other cultures, other nationalities.\n\n\"It is not on the radar, except in certain areas where people are getting caught.\"\n\nVideo has emerged of a gig in 2023 appearing to show one band member saying: \"The only good Tory is a dead Tory.\"\n\nThis was the second security alert in County Antrim on Saturday, with another device found in Newtownabbey.\n\nBy the middle of the week, temperatures could rise close to the April record of 24.5C.\n\nA small rural community in County Tyrone open a box hidden away for a quarter century.\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "1,500 active-duty troops headed to US-Mexico border\n\nUS President Donald Trump told US government agencies to prepare to \"immediately repel, repatriate, and remove\" undocumented immigrants as part of a wider effort to fight what he's termed an \"invasion\" across the southern border.\n\nTrump's order comes as US officials announce the deployment of additional active duty troops to the border, and as processes that allow swift deportations are expanded.\n\nThe US also moved to cancel all refugee travel and processing, leaving thousands stranded as they wait to come to the US.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump is \"sending a very strong message\" to people around the world with the actions.\n\nAn executive action, posted to the White House's website, argues that the measures are necessary to prevent undocumented immigrants from entering the US, \"invading\" US communities and \"imposing billions of dollars of costs\" on state and local governments.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after Trump signed the order, Ms Leavitt said that the border was a \"number one priority\" for the president.\n\n\"If you are thinking about breaking the laws of the United States of America, you will be returned home,\" Leavitt said of Trump's message. \"You will be arrested. You will be prosecuted.\"\n\nMs Leavitt also confirmed that 1,500 additional troops would be sent to the US-Mexico border.\n\nThe newly inaugurated president has signed a flurry of immigration and border-related actions and decrees this week aimed at cracking down on immigration.\n\nThe orders include tackling the definition of birthright citizenship and declaring illegal immigration at the border a national emergency.\n\nA notice posted on the website of the Federal Register says the expedited removal policy took effect on the evening of 21 January.\n\nThe policy, which has traditionally been limited to undocumented migrants detained within 100 miles (160km) of the country's international borders, now allows officers to use it anywhere in the US.\n\n\"The effect of this change will be to enhance national security and public safety - while reducing government costs - by facilitating prompting immigration determinations,\" the notice reads.\n\nIt adds that the change will allow the Department of Homeland Security to address \"the large volume of aliens\" in the US illegally and ensure the \"prompt removal...of those not entitled to enter, remain, or be provided relief or protection\".\n\nThe expanded policy could be challenged in court.\n\nUntil now, \"unauthorised\" immigrants detained in the US were given a notice to appear in immigration court, where they could present their case for asylum.\n\nDeportation proceedings typically couldn't begin until a judge issued a decision.\n\nBut earlier this week, Trump cited an immigration law - 212(f) - that allows the president to suspend the entry of foreign nationals deemed \"detrimental\" to the US.\n\nCiting internal documents and US officials, CBS has reported that the policy also applies to the US border with Canada and to Customs and Border Protection's maritime sectors, such as Florida.\n\nThe separate order to stop refugee travel and processing comes just days after Trump signed an executive order suspending the US's Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP), saying America \"lacks the ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans\".\n\nIt halts USRAP until \"further entry into the United States of refugees aligns with the interests of the United States\", the order says.\n\nMore than 1,600 Afghans who had already been approved to come to the US have had their travel plans cancelled, prompting an advocacy group, Afghan USRAP Refugees, to pen an open letter to President Trump.\n\nMore than 3,000 other Afghan nationals are waiting in Albania to be resettled in the US.\n\nIn another significant departure from the Biden administration's immigration policies announced on Tuesday, the Department of Homeland Security has rescinded existing guidelines that prevent immigration officers from entering \"sensitive\" areas such as schools.\n\nIn a statement, DHS said that the guidelines \"thwart\" law enforcement.\n\n\"This action empowers the brave men and women in CBP [Customs and Border Protection] and ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] to enforce our immigration laws and catch criminal aliens - including murderers and rapists - who have illegally come into our country,\" a DHS spokesman said.\n\nThe spokesman added that \"the Trump administration will not tie the hands\" of law enforcement, and expects them to \"use common sense.\"\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nThe US president says he fears the Russian leader is \"tapping me along\" given Moscow's strikes on Kyiv earlier this week.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Trump border czar warns New York Mayor Eric Adams not to violate 'agreement' as DOJ orders dismissal of case against him\n\nPresident Donald Trump 's border czar implicitly warned New York Mayor Eric Adams during a joint televised interview Friday to follow through on his promise to allow federal immigration authorities into the city's massive jail complex on Rikers Island.\n\n\"If he doesn't come through, I'll be back in New York City, and we won't be sitting on a couch,\" Trump immigration chief Thomas Homan said Friday in a joint interview with Adams on \"Fox and Friends.\"\n\n\"I'll be in his office, up his butt, saying, 'Where the hell is the agreement we came to?'\" Homan said.\n\nAdams chuckled nervously during Homan's comment, saying only, \"We're going to deliver for the safety of the people of this city.\"\n\nAdams' promise Thursday to sign an executive order that would permit federal authorities to enter Rikers came just hours after the stunning resignations of six top Department of Justice prosecutors. The prosecutors said they quit rather than carry out a DOJ official's orders that they dismiss criminal corruption charges filed against the mayor.\n\nHoman and Adams met Thursday in advance of the mayor's announcement of the order.\n\n\"I came to New York City and I wasn't going to leave with nothing,\" Homan said on Fox News on Friday.\n\nShortly after Homan and Adams' joint interview, news broke that assistant Manhattan U.S. Attorney Hagan Scotten - who had been the lead prosecutor in the case against Adams - resigned.\n\n\"I expect you will eventually find someone who is enough of a fool, or enough of a coward, to file your motion\" to dismiss the Adams case, Scotten wrote to high-ranking DOJ official Emil Bove in an email Friday.\n\nScotten's former boss, acting Manhattan U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon, resigned Thursday after telling Attorney General Pam Bondi that Adams' lawyers recently urged DOJ officials to agree to what amounted to a \"quid pro quo\" with the mayor.\n\nIn exchange for Adams' bribery case being dropped by federal prosecutors, the mayor would allow the Trump administration to carry out immigration enforcement actions in New York City, Sassoon wrote in a letter to Bondi.\n\nAdams and his lawyer, Alex Spiro, deny there is a quid pro quo deal with the DOJ.\n\nTrump on Thursday denied telling the DOJ to dismiss the charges against Adams.\n\nAdams was indicted in September on charges including campaign contribution conspiracy, wire fraud and bribery, which include allegations he accepted $100,000 worth of plane tickets and luxury hotel stays from wealthy Turkish nationals.\n\nThe order to dismiss the Adams case came from Bove, a former criminal defense lawyer for Trump who now holds a top job at the DOJ.\n\nBove issued the directive first to Sassoon, who refused to do it and resigned. Bove then ordered several senior DOJ officials in Washington to carry out his demand.\n\nLike Sassoon, they too refused to comply with Bove's order.\n\nAs of Friday morning, the case against Adams technically remained pending in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.\n\nBove was appointed to his DOJ post by Trump after representing the president last year at his criminal hush money trial in New York, which ended in Trump's conviction.\n\nIn her letter Wednesday to the attorney general, Sassoon said that Bove had proposed \"dismissing the charges against Adams in return for his assistance in enforcing the federal immigration laws.\"\n\nCritics of Bove's order have warned that by seeking to dismiss the criminal case against Adams without prejudice, meaning that the criminal charges can be refiled at any time, the DOJ is effectively putting the mayor under its thumb.\n\nIf the prospect of a revived criminal case against Adams is constantly hanging over the mayor's head, his ability to act independently, or refuse to do the president's bidding, would be severely compromised, they say.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Immigration is 'taking pressure off' the job market and U.S. economy, expert says\n\nThe share of immigrants in the U.S. labor force has steadily increased for more than a decade, and that growth is poised to continue - a trend economists say benefits the American workforce and economy.\n\nIn 2006, 15.3% of the civilian labor force was made up of \"foreign-born\" workers, or those born outside the U.S., according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That share hit a record 18.6% in 2023.\n\nMark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, said the increase in foreign-born workers is \"taking pressure off the economy.\"\n\n\"In fact, it's probably one reason why the economy grew so strongly last year,\" he said.\n\nU.S. gross domestic product, a measure of economic output, grew by 2.5% in 2023, beating expectations and increasing from 1.9% in 2022.\n\nThe growth in foreign-born workers comes amid a contentious immigration policy debate in the U.S.\n\nIn mid-February, House Republicans impeached U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, whom they blame for perceived shortcomings in border security. He now faces the prospect of a Senate trial.\n\nMeanwhile, cities are trying to absorb an influx of people arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border. In December, the U.S. Border Patrol reported almost 250,000 encounters with migrants crossing into the U.S. from Mexico. That marked a monthly record, though that number fell by half in January, according to federal data .\n\n\"The present migrant crisis is quite unprecedented, both in scale, in the diversity of the nationalities that are coming to the border, and the impact it's having not only on the border states but in the states and cities inside the country,\" Muzaffar Chishti, senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan immigration policy think tank, recently told CNBC.\n\nIn 2023, about 31.1 million workers out of the 167.1 million in the U.S. labor force were foreign-born, on average. The remainder were \"native-born\" workers, those born in the U.S. Immigrants' share of the labor force has increased since 1996, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics began collecting such data.\n\nMost are here legally: In 2021, 4.6% of U.S. workers were unauthorized, a share that's stayed in a \"narrow range\" since 2005, according to the Pew Research Center.\n\nMore than 3.7 million immigrants joined the U.S. labor force between 2020 and 2023, on average - a 13.7% increase. Meanwhile, 2.6 million native-born workers joined the labor force over the same period, a 2% increase.\n\nThe labor force is the sum of people ages 16 and older who have jobs or are unemployed and actively looking for work.\n\nA growing population and labor force are key components of a healthy economy and the nation's ability to pay its bills, economists said.\n\nIn simple terms, more workers generate more goods and services. A larger number of people earning paychecks means more consumer spending, the lifeblood of the U.S. economy. More people paying income tax on earnings boosts tax revenues at a time of growing U.S. budget deficits , and helps prop up social programs such as Social Security and Medicare, which are funded by payroll taxes and facing a shortfall .\n\nThe problem is that native-born U.S. households are having fewer children and the baby boom generation is aging out of the job market , economists said. Absent immigration, such dynamics would cause a long-term shrinking of the U.S. population and labor force, while social programs would require greater tax revenue to support more retiring seniors.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, a nonpartisan federal agency, predicts U.S. deaths will exceed births starting in 2040, at which point immigration will account for all population growth.\n\n\"When you just consider the native-born population, we're seeing very little labor force growth because of the aging population and low birth rates,\" said Jack Malde, senior policy analyst at the Bipartisan Policy Center.\n\nImmigrant workers tend to be younger , too, helping counterbalance the U.S.' aging workforce.\n\nAbout 91% of immigrants age 16 or older who arrive in the U.S. from 2022 to 2034 will be under age 55, according to recent projections by the CBO. By comparison, that would be true for just 62% of the overall U.S. adult population.\n\nGiven the needs of the U.S. workforce, immigration has been \"a net benefit for the economy,\" said Malde, who specializes in immigration and workforce policy.\n\nMore from Personal Finance: Pessimism about job market may not be warranted Why millennials' retirement outlook isn't rosy This popular paycheck service is 'payday lending on steroids,' says expert\n\nThe CBO estimates the U.S. labor force will grow by 5.2 million people from 2023 to 2034, largely due to \"a surge in immigration\" that began in 2022 and will continue through 2026. As a result, gross domestic product will be about $7 trillion higher and revenues $1 trillion larger than they would have been otherwise, it said.\n\n\"More workers means more output, more income, and that in turn leads to the higher revenue,\" Phillip Swagel, CBO director, said of those projections during a House hearing in February.\n\nImmigrant workers have also helped put downward pressure on pandemic-era inflation by easing a shortage of workers, economists said.\n\nJob openings surged to record highs in 2021 and 2022 as the U.S. economy reopened. The ready availability of jobs led businesses to compete for talent by raising wages at their fastest pace in decades ; higher labor costs pressured businesses to raise prices, stoking inflation.\n\nIn economic parlance, the labor market was \"tight.\"\n\n\"Reopening of borders in 2022 and easing of immigration policies brought a sizable immigration rebound, which in turn helped alleviate the shortage of workers relative to job vacancies,\" Evgeniya Duzhak, regional policy economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, wrote in a 2023 paper .\n\nWhile a larger immigrant workforce raises overall GDP and tax revenue, those measures may not be the best barometers of economic impact, said Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, a group advocating for tighter immigration controls.\n\n\"If that's your goal, immigration is good policy,\" Camarota said. \"If your goal is to increase per capita GDP, that's a very different question.\"\n\nA Center for Immigration Studies analysis of Census Bureau data found that labor force participation among 25- to 54-year-old U.S.-born men without a high school diploma declined 5 percentage points, to 70%, from 2000 to 2023.\n\nIt fell 6 percentage points, to 84%, for those with a high-school diploma over that time, but fell only 2 points, to 94%, for college-educated men, the analysis found.\n\nCamarota said immigration - along with factors such as globalization, weaker unions and a stagnant federal minimum wage - suppressed wages and made it harder for native-born men without college degrees to find jobs, keeping them on the sidelines and causing their labor force participation to decline. Foreign-born workers provide businesses with an easy labor supply, leading policymakers not to care as much about the U.S.-born groups being left behind, he said.\n\n\"For society, [immigration] is not such a good deal,\" Camarota said.\n\nThe extent to which immigration may be keeping U.S.-born men without college degrees on the sidelines is unclear, Malde said. There are other reasons why their labor force participation may have declined long-term, he said: automation and technology reducing the demand for low-skilled labor; economic shifts away from manufacturing and toward service-oriented jobs, which often require higher educational attainment; and changing social norms.\n\nThe prime-age labor force participation rate of U.S.-born men without a college degree \"grew at a record pace in each of the last two years and is above its pre-COVID trend,\" according to the Economic Policy Institute, or EPI, a left-leaning think tank.\n\nIn other words, the economy is both absorbing immigrants and generating job opportunities for U.S.-born workers, the institute said. The idea that immigrants are \"taking all our jobs\" is \"deeply misguided,\" EPI researchers wrote in a recent analysis .\n\nThe U.S. unemployment rate has been below 4% for two years, hovering near record lows. It was an average 3.6% for U.S.-born workers in 2023, the lowest rate on record, EPI said.\n\n\"The labor market is tight as a drum,\" especially for the types of lower-paid jobs many immigrants take, Zandi said.\n\n\"There's just no evidence at this point in time that immigrants are taking American jobs,\" Zandi added. \"They're jobs that are simply going unfilled.\"\n\nA 2017 meta analysis of economic research on immigration conducted by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine suggests the impact of immigration on the overall U.S.-born wage \"may be small and close to zero,\" particularly when measured over a period of 10 years or more.\n\nHowever, evidence for certain \"subgroups\" of the workforce, especially those most likely to compete with immigrants, is somewhat mixed, the analysis found. For example, some studies suggest \"sizable negative wage effects on native high school dropouts,\" though there are \"still a number of studies that suggest small to zero effects,\" it said.\n\nThere's also a \"sizable\" concentration of immigrants in jobs that require high education and skill levels, such as computer software developers, accountants and physicians, the paper noted. In these jobs, \"the evidence is stronger, though still inconclusive\" that immigrants are pushing up wages \"modestly,\" it said.\n\nImmigrants also launch new businesses at far higher rates than the overall U.S. population, according to research published in 2020.\n\nThe study - authored by researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, University of Pennsylvania, Northwestern University and the U.S. Census Bureau - found immigrants in the U.S. workforce to be \"substantial job creators\" with an 80% higher \"entrance rate into entrepreneurship\" compared with native-born individuals. It examined data on more than 1 million firms founded between 2005 and 2010 that survived for at least five years.\n\n\"Overall, the findings suggest that immigrants appear to 'create jobs' (expand labor demand) more than they 'take jobs' (expand labor supply) in the U.S. economy,\" the study said.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Trump vows to deport millions. Builders say it would drain their crews and drive up home costs\n\nBoth presidential candidates promise to build more homes . One promises to deport hundreds of thousands of people who build them.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump's pledge to \"launch the largest deportation operation in the history of our country\" would hamstring construction firms already facing labor shortages and push record home prices higher, say industry leaders, contractors and economists.\n\n\"It would be detrimental to the construction industry and our labor supply and exacerbate our housing affordability problems,\" said Jim Tobin, CEO of the National Association of Home Builders. The trade group considers foreign-born workers, regardless of legal status, \"a vital and flexible source of labor\" to builders, estimating they fill 30% of trade jobs like carpentry, plastering, masonry and electrical roles.\n\nNearly 11 million undocumented immigrants were living in the U.S. as of 2022, the latest federal data shows, down from an 11.8 million peak in 2007. The construction sector employs an estimated 1.5 million undocumented workers, or 13% of its total workforce - a larger share than any other, according to data the Pew Research Center provided to NBC News. Industry experts say their rates are higher in Sun Belt states like Florida and Texas, and more pronounced in residential than in commercial construction.\n\nFor Brent Taylor, home building has been \"a very, very difficult industry the past few years, and it seems to only be getting worse.\" His five-person, Tampa-based business hires subcontractors to perform all the labor, and if those firms' employees \"show up on my jobsite because they work for that company, I don't know if they're legal or not,\" he said.\n\nThe labor pool is tight already, with the U.S. construction industry still looking to fill 370,000 open positions , according to federal data. If work crews dwindle further, \"now I can only do 10 jobs a year instead of 20,\" Taylor said. \"Either I make half as much money or I up my prices. And who ultimately pays for that? The homeowner.\"\n\nTrump hasn't detailed how his proposed \"whole of government\" effort to remove up to 20 million people - far more than the undocumented population - would work, but he has made it central to his housing pitch. The Republican nominee claims mass deportations would free up homes for U.S. citizens and lower prices, though few economists agree . The idea has also drawn skepticism on logistical grounds, with some analysts saying its costs would be \"astronomical.\"\n\nRead more from NBC News:\n\nDoubts also run high among homebuilders that Trump would deliver on his promise.\n\n\"They don't think it's going to happen,\" Stan Marek, CEO of the Marek Family of Companies, a Texas-based specialty subcontracting firm, said of industry colleagues. \"You'd lose so many people that you couldn't put a crew together to frame a house.\"\n\nBryan Dunn, an-Arizona based senior vice president at Big-D Construction, a major Southwest firm, called \"the idea that they could actually move that many people\" out of the country \"almost laughable.\" The proposal has left those in the industry \"trying to figure out how much is political fearmongering,\" he said.\n\nBut while Trump has a history of floating outlandish ideas without seriously pursuing them - like buying Greenland - he has embraced other once-radical policies that reset the terms of political debate despite fierce criticism and litigation. That is especially true with immigration, where his administration diverted Pentagon money to build a border wall, banned travel from several Muslim-majority countries and separated migrant children from their parents.\n\nTrump has emphasized his deportation pitch on the stump, at times deploying racist rhetoric like claiming thousands of immigrants are committing murders because \"it's in their genes.\" This month he accused immigrant gangs of having \"invaded and conquered\" cities like Aurora, Colorado, which local authorities deny , saying they need federal assistance but want no part in mass deportations. Still, recent polling has found broad support for removing people who came to the U.S. illegally.\n\n\"President Trump's mass deportation of illegal immigrants will not only make our communities safer but will save Americans from footing the bill for years to come,\" Taylor Rogers, a Republican National Committee spokesperson for the campaign, said in a statement, referring to undocumented people's use of taxpayer-funded social services and other federal programs.\n\nTrump campaign press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement that the former president's remarks about genetics were \"clearly referring to murderers, not migrants.\"\n\nTobin said the NAHB has real concerns about the deportation proposal but is engaging with both campaigns. It has called on policymakers to \"let builders build\" by easing zoning and other regulatory hurdles and improving developers' access to financing.\n\n\"The rhetoric on immigration, it's at 11,\" Tobin said. \"We have to have a serious conversation in this country about immigration policy and reform, and we can no longer delay it.\"\n\nMarek, who has long advocated for more ways for undocumented people to work legally in construction, said reforms are decades overdue. As an employer, \"I do everything I can to make sure everybody's legal,\" he said, even as the industry's hunger for low-cost labor has created a shadow economy that he says often exploits the undocumented workers it depends upon.\n\n\"We need them. They're building our houses - have been for 30 years,\" he said. \"Losing the workers would devastate our companies, our industry and our economy.\"\n\nThere is evidence that foreign-born construction workers help keep the housing market in check. An analysis released in December 2022 by the George W. Bush Institute and Southern Methodist University found U.S. metro areas with the fastest-growing immigrant populations had the lowest building costs.\n\n\"Immigrant construction workers in Sun Belt metros like Raleigh, Nashville, Houston, and San Antonio have helped these cities sustain their housing cost advantage over coastal cities despite rapid growth in housing demand,\" the authors wrote.\n\nBut builders need many more workers as it is. \"The math is just not there\" to sustain a blow from mass deportations, said Ron Hetrick, a senior labor economist at the workforce analytics firm Lightcast. \"That would be incredibly disruptive\" and cause \"a very, very significant hit on home construction,\" he said.\n\nPrivate employers in the field have been adding jobs for the past decade, with employment levels now topping 8 million , over 1 million more since the pandemic, according to payroll processor ADP. But as Hetrick noted, \"the average high school student is not aspiring to do this work,\" and the existing workforce is aging - the average homebuilder is 57 years old .\n\nUndocumented workers would likely flee ahead of any national deportation effort, Hetrick said, even though many have been in the U.S. for well over a decade. He expects such a policy would trigger an exodus of people with legal authorization, too.\n\n\"That's exactly what happened in Florida,\" he said.\n\nLast year, the state's Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, enacted a series of restrictions and penalties to deter the employment of undocumented workers. Many immigrant workers hastily left the state even before the policies took effect, with social media videos showing some construction sites sitting empty .\n\n\"These laws show that they have no idea what we do,\" said Luciano, a carpenter who is originally from Mexico and has worked on residential builds across South Florida for the past decade.\n\n\"No one else would work in the conditions in which we work,\" the 40-year-old said in Spanish, asking to be identified by his first name because he lacks legal immigration status, despite living in the U.S. for over 20 years. Workers on jobsites \"have an entry time but no exit time,\" often logging 70-hour weeks in rain and extreme heat, he said.\n\nTaylor recalled fellow Florida builders' panic at the time of the statewide crackdown but said he reassured them, \"Look, just give it six months. We don't have enough people to enforce it, so they're coming back.\"\n\nRepublican state Rep. Rick Roth, who voted for the measure, later conceded that Florida was unprepared for the destabilization it would cause and urged immigrant residents not to flee, saying the law \"is not as bad as you heard.\"\n\nSome workers returned after realizing the policies weren't being rigorously enforced, Taylor said: \"Sure enough, now things are more normal.\"\n\nDeSantis' office didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhen Arizona in 2010 enacted what were then some of the toughest immigration restrictions in the country, Dunn was working in Tempe as an executive at a construction management firm. As the legislation rolled out, he said, \"a lot of people moved away, and they just never came back.\"\n\nBy the time much of the law was overturned in 2012, he said, \"Arizona had a bad rap\" relative to other states that \"were a lot more open and just less of a hassle to go work in.\"\n\nDunn, a Democrat, said he's \"definitely\" backing Vice President Kamala Harris, but other construction executives sounded more divided. Marek, a \"lifelong Republican,\" declined to share how he's voting but noted that \"a lot of Republicans aren't voting for Trump.\"\n\nTaylor also wouldn't say which candidate he's supporting but praised Trump's ability to \"get things done.\"\n\n\"There are many other issues with the economy that we are fighting daily that have nothing to do with immigration reform,\" he said. \"I am not a one-policy voter.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "What economists say about JD Vance's claim that immigrants drive up housing costs\n\nAmerica's two vice presidential candidates agreed Tuesday night that America is in the midst of a housing crisis in which too few homes and steady demand have led to soaring costs.\n\nBut Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz presented radically different views of how the country got there - and how to fix the problem.\n\nHousing is one of many issues Vance, the Republican nominee, believes are rooted in the arrival of undocumented migrants in America.\n\n\"Look, in Springfield, Ohio, and in communities all across this country, you've got schools that are overwhelmed, you've got hospitals that are overwhelmed, you have got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes,\" Vance said, according to a CBS News transcript. Along with zoning reform, Vance and Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump have premised much of their policy on an unprecedented mass-deportation plan that they argue would reduce competition for housing.\n\nRead more from NBC News:\n\nWalz, the Democratic nominee, said the reasons for America's housing crisis are more nuanced.\n\n\"We can't blame immigrants for the only reason,\" he said. \"The fact of the matter is that we don't have enough naturally affordable housing, but we can make sure that the government's there to help kick-start it, create that, create that base.\" Walz and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, hope to use tax incentives and spending to spur housing construction and ease the financial burden of buying a home.\n\nHousing is expensive in the U.S.: The NBC News Home Buyer Difficulty Index remains extremely high , and shelter costs continue to account for the majority of consumer inflation, having climbed more than 24% since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Rents have climbed even faster.\n\nBut many economists caution that connecting rising numbers of immigrants to housing costs is no simple thing. Some have said there is no way to examine existing data and surveys in real time to determine the extent of immigrants' impact on individual housing markets - though a chart drawn up by Ernie Tedeschi, a former White House chief economist for President Joe Biden, showed no clear connection between foreign-born population growth and native-born home prices on a national scale.\n\nOther economists have noted links between immigrants and increased housing costs. After the debate, Vance's X account shared a link to remarks by Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman, who said that \"the inflow of new immigrants to some geographic areas could result in upward pressure on rents, as additional housing supply may take time to materialize\" - though in the same speech, she said immigrants had also helped ease labor shortages.\n\nVance later shared two studies on housing and immigration that showed a link between increased immigration and rising housing costs - though each offered various caveats, including noting that the impact changes over time.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Cato Institute, a conservative think tank, published a blog post titled \"JD Vance Is Correct: Immigration Increases Housing Prices, and That's Okay,\" arguing that while rising immigrant populations do lead to increased housing costs, \"most of the increase in housing wealth caused by immigration accrues to native-born Americans\" and that immigrants also increase the overall housing supply thanks to their outsized ranks in the construction industry.\n\nBut in general, economists are skeptical that immigrants are the main driver of the current predicament. Chris Herbert, managing director of Harvard University's Joint Center for Housing Studies, said that while immigrants do add to overall housing demand, \"they cannot be blamed for the recent surge in home prices and rents that took off in 2020 and 2021.\" That was when immigration reached its lowest levels in decades because of the pandemic, he said in a statement emailed to news outlets.\n\nWhen immigration started to surge in 2022 and peaked in 2023, Herbert said, \"growth in home prices and rents slowed dramatically.\"\n\n\"Trends in interest rates and the pandemic-induced demand for housing were mostly responsible for the recent trends in housing costs,\" he added.\n\nHistorically, immigrants have tended to coalesce in depopulated or underused towns or neighborhoods without directly competing with native-born residents, said Sharon Cornelissen, director of housing for the Consumer Federation of America, which advocates for equitable housing policies. She cited immigrant inflows that helped revitalize New York City and Los Angeles in the 1970s and the 1980s cities as they were dealing with the aftermath of white flight.\n\nMiddle Eastern populations have also been responsible for helping turn around the cities of Dearborn and Hamtramck outside Detroit, she said.\n\nThere is evidence that more recent immigrant influxes have proven difficult to handle for the communities where they have arrived.\n\nIn Brockton, Massachusetts, immigrants from a variety of countries, including Haiti, Cape Verde and countries in Central and South America, have strained local resources - though mostly in the form of emergency shelter capacity. NBC Boston reported this summer that immigrant-focused nonprofit groups have been helping place newly arrived families in motels and that they also tapped partnerships with private landlords to set up others in apartments.\n\nHousing problems predate the immigration surge in Springfield, Ohio, which has become a flashpoint in the national immigration debate, City Manager Bryan Heck said in a letter to Vance and Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown this summer.\n\nBut Heck acknowledged the migrants had played a part in complicating the situation.\n\n\"Most recently, Springfield has seen a surge in population through immigration that has significantly impacted our ability as a community to produce enough housing opportunities for all,\" Heck wrote, estimating the city's Haitian population had increased to 15,000 to 20,000 over the last four years in a community of just under 60,000 residents.\n\nThe growth, he said, put a \"significant\" strain on the city's ability to provide housing for all residents. Indeed, Zillow data shows a clear upward trend in Springfield rents this year compared with 2023.\n\n\"Despite 2,000 additional housing units set to come online over the next three to five years, this is still not enough,\" Heck said.\n\nHis demand? More aid from Washington.\n\n\"Without further support at the Federal level, communities like Springfield are set up to fail in being able to meet the housing needs of its residents,\" he wrote.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "ICE faces budget shortage that could delay Trump's mass deportation plans\n\nThe incoming Trump administration is already making plans to harness the power of Immigration and Customs Enforcement to vastly increase the number of undocumented immigrants deported from the United States. But it faces an obstacle: ICE is already dealing with a $230 million budget shortfall, even before the costs that will be associated with mass deportations, according to two U.S. officials familiar with the figure.\n\nEven with the continuing resolution spending bill introduced this week in Congress, ICE will continue to face a funding shortfall the officials said, because its operations -including detaining and deporting migrants at the current levels - are outpacing the $8.7 billion annual budget currently allocated to it by Congress. The continuing resolution, which is expected to pass this week, will extend current funding levels, including funding for ICE, until March 14.\n\n\"We are running hot,\" said the two officials, who spoke separately. They attributed the shortfall to the agency being historically underfunded and the increased need for ICE to remove migrants who are deemed ineligible for asylum, a number which has increased since June, when the Biden administration changed asylum policy.\n\nICE's budget shortfall may mean Donald Trump would have to delay his plans to boost the agency and ramp up deportations on the first day of his presidency.\n\nThe American Immigration Council, a pro-immigration research and advocacy group, estimates Trump's plan for mass deportations will cost more than $88 billion. Trump himself told NBC News' Kristen Welker earlier this month that there is \"no price tag\" when it comes to carrying out his mass deportation plan.\n\nCongress has only two avenues to appropriate more funding to ICE in the near term without an emergency supplemental request from the White House. In January, when Republicans have control of the White House and the Senate and narrow control of the House, negotiations on next year's spending levels will begin in earnest.\n\nRepublicans could appropriate additional funding to ICE as part of the next government spending package, but it would require compromising with Democrats who will almost certainly need to provide votes to pass any bill through regular order.\n\nRepublicans have also discussed beefing up funds to ICE using budget reconciliation, a wonky procedural tool that enables the majority to bypass the mandatory 60-vote threshold to pass legislation related to funding. But the effort is already being met with resistance from some in the party who want to save their political capital to extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts later in the year.\n\nBoth strategies will take some time to muscle through both chambers of Congress, especially with House Speaker Mike Johnson facing an even slimmer majority in the new year. And the internal strife will make Trump's plan to begin carrying out mass deportations on the very first day of his presidency an even heavier lift.\n\nThe two officials also said they believe ICE has been historically underfunded for its wide mission. There are nearly 8 million immigrants on ICE's docket, one ICE officer for every 7,000 cases, ICE Director P.J. Lechleitner told NBC News in June. He said the ratio was \"not good,\" and others inside ICE have said it is impossible for agents to keep tabs on all of the migrants' whereabouts inside the country.\n\n\"We are chronically underresourced and need more funding,\" Lechleitner said at the time.\n\nIn February, the agency said it might have to consider releasing migrants if it did not get more funding for detention beds coming off of 2023's record high number of border crossings. The border bill negotiated by a bipartisan group of senators earlier this year asked for $9.5 billion and the Biden administration's fiscal year 2025 budget request asked for $9.3 billion for the agency, but those levels have yet to be passed through Congress despite Republicans calling on the administration to increase immigration enforcement.\n\nRead more from NBC News:\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "How Trump's mass deportation plan can use AI to extend immigration crackdown\n\nTo join the CNBC Technology Executive Council, go to cnbccouncils.com/tec\n\nA signature campaign promise of President-elect Donald Trump is to initiate mass deportations of undocumented residents of the United States. At a Sept. 12 campaign stop in Tucson, Arizona, Trump promised to \"begin the largest mass deportation mission in the history of our country.\"\n\nTrump's selection of Thomas Homan as \"border czar\" and Stephen Miller as deputy chief of staff for policy , two officials seen as hard-liners on immigration, suggest that the administration's approach to a crackdown will attempt to make good on that promise and be aggressive, though details have not been provided by the Trump transition team.\n\nTrump has said he will start mass deportation efforts with criminals, but he has also vowed to repeal Temporary Protected Status for individuals. He said in a brief post-election interview with NBC News that he has \"no choice\" but to pursue mass deportation after the election results, and that there is \"no price tag.\"\n\nHoman, former acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said earlier this year that \"No one's off the table. If you're here illegally, you better be looking over your shoulder,\" and he vowed to \"run the biggest deportation force this country has ever seen.\"\n\nCarrying out these pledges, though, is logistically daunting . Artificial intelligence may help.\n\nWhile AI wasn't widely used during the first Trump administration's immigration crackdown, the technology has become more accessible and widely deployed across many systems and government agencies, and President Biden's administration began devoting DHS budget and organizational focus to it.\n\nIn April, the Department of Homeland Security created the Artificial Intelligence Safety and Security Board to help establish perimeters and protocols for the technology's use. The 2025 DHS budget includes $5 million to open an AI Office in the DHS Office of the Chief Information Officer. According to the DHS budget memo, the office is responsible for advancing and accelerating the \"responsible use\" of AI by establishing standards, policies, and oversight to support the growing adoption of AI across DHS.\n\n\"AI is a transformative technology that can unprecedentedly advance our national interests. At the same time, it presents real risks we can mitigate by adopting best practices and taking other studied concrete actions,\" DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said when inaugurating the new board.\n\nNow there is concern among experts that DHS's mission will pivot towards deportation and use untested AI to help. Security experts close to DHS worry about how an emboldened and reoriented DHS might wield AI.\n\nA Department of Homeland Security spokesman wouldn't speculate on how AI might be used in Trump's administration.\n\nThe Trump transition and Homan did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nPetra Molnar, a lawyer and anthropologist specializing in the impacts of migration technologies on people crossing borders and the author of \"The Walls Have Eyes: Surviving Migration in the Age of Artificial Intelligence,\" has studied the use of technology along the border, which includes drones and robodogs, as faculty associate at Harvard University's Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society. She has been critical of AI's use at the border under Democratic Party administrations, but does think that the weaponization of AI will grow under Trump's administration.\n\n\"Knowing the Trump administration has signaled they want to conduct the largest mass deportation in U.S. history and the fact that they have these tools at their disposal, it creates a surveillance dragnet not just at the border but inland that could capture communities all over the U.S.,\" Molnar said, adding that an entire ecosystem of industry has been created to police borders and immigration.\n\n\"There's been a huge influence of the private sector in the growth of the border-industrial problem,\" Molnar said, adding that private companies have led the way in introducing robodogs (with benign names like Snoopy and Sniffer), drones, and AI-infused towers.\n\n\"Much of the surveillance technology has been expanded under Democratic administrations, but there has been a signaling of the incoming administration that tech will be a tool to assist them in accomplishing their goals,\" Molnar said.\n\nRemaya Campbell, acting commissioner for Homeland Security for the District of Columbia, said that AI could automate immigration-related decision-making, bypassing traditional processes.\n\n\"AI could be used to identify individuals for deportation broadly. With little regard for privacy or due process,\" Campbell said, adding that AI decision-making systems operate with the values their users impart. \"And in the Trump administration, that could certainly mean reinforcing intersectional biases to align with political priorities,\" she said. \"At a minimum, we could expect AI to be leveraged not as a tool for efficiency, fairness, and safety in immigration-related decision-making, but as an instrument of systemic bias and authoritarian rule,\" Campbell added.\n\nNeil Sahota, an AI advisor to the United Nations AI for Good Initiative, said he shares those concerns given that AI already has a muscular presence in managing the vast, challenging-to-monitor U.S. borders, and that usage will expand under Trump.\n\nDHS's Customs and Border Protection already has employed AI-powered drones with machine-learning capabilities to identify unusual patterns that could signal illegal crossings, drones that can distinguish between people, animals, and vehicles, and help to minimize false alarms, Sahota said. Sensor towers equipped with AI provide 24/7 monitoring, allowing faster response times and freeing up human resources.\n\n\"Expectations are that a Trump administration would push for even more AI surveillance, potentially introducing autonomous patrols and expanding biometric screening,\" Sahota said.\n\nWhile this could improve border security, it could also spark concerns around privacy, particularly for those living near borders. And Sahota added that the Trump administration's use of AI could expand beyond security and aid in deportation. \"AI surveillance systems would be a cornerstone of Trump's deportation strategy,\" Sahotra said. \"Enhanced AI could fast-track deportations,\" Sahota added, which would come with the potential for rights violations and racial profiling.\n\nThese systems use facial recognition and behavior analysis capabilities to identify people suspected of being in the country illegally, but he cautioned that these systems don't always get it right . \"How do we handle situations where AI makes errors in identifying people's immigration status? What if the system mistakenly flags a legal resident or citizen for deportation? The consequences are devastating for families and our community,\" Sahota said.\n\nLaura MacCleery, senior policy director of Unidos U.S., the nation's largest Hispanic advocacy group, said AI accuracy problems are well known, with systems making inaccurate conclusions, and data on people of color tending to be less accurate.\n\nDMV records, utility bills, and facial recognition technology at the border and the airports will all be tools that could be enhanced with AI to pursue deportation.\n\n\"These technologies could be changed and altered and have different guardrails in a different administration. The concern about mass deportations is the enhanced use of AI by immigration enforcement and to superpower the ability to monitor public data, MacCleery said.\n\nIt is inevitable, she said, that AI will sweep up U.S. citizens.\n\n\"Because there are U.S. citizens that live with people of different immigration status and those people will get swept up and the due process rights of people who are here legally could be violated and that is super problematic and an inevitable consequence of the overuse of these kinds of technologies,\" MacCleery said.\n\nBut Marina Shepelsky, CEO, co-founder, and immigration attorney at New York-based Shepelsky Law Group, said she is not thinking about AI policy in the Trump administration as a dystopian technology to fear. \"He is a businessman, he will see value in allowing AI to progress and grow to make the lives of lawyers like myself, doctors, scientists, etc., easier,\" Shepelsky said.\n\nShe thinks AI will blossom and be deregulated in a Trump administration. \"Hopefully, with Elon Musk at his side, President Trump would push for more foreign tech AI experts to come to the U.S. quicker and with less red tape to improve AI and reduce its current awkwardness,\" Shepelsky said. \"I am not an alarmist and not tearing out my hair about Trump being our next president. I may not like all his policies, but with AI - I do think he will push for its growth, and for laws and regulations to be more flexible to allow AI to grow.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

We want people to come in.\"\n\nAs a candidate, Trump had repeatedly vowed to carry out the \"largest deportation effort in American history.\" Asked about the cost of his plan, he said, \"It's not a question of a price tag. It's not - really, we have no choice. When people have killed and murdered, when drug lords have destroyed countries and now they're going to go back to those countries because they're not staying here. There is no price tag.\"\n\nIt's unclear how many undocumented immigrants there are in the U.S., but acting ICE Director Patrick J. Lechleitner told NBC News in July that a mass deportation effort would be a huge logistical and financial challenge. Two former Trump administration officials involved in immigration during his first term told NBC News that the effort would require cooperation between a number of federal agencies, including the Justice Department and the Pentagon.\n\nTrump's win included record gains among Latino voters, who Democrats had tried to capture by pointing to Trump's rhetoric on immigrants and a pro-Trump comedian's racist joke about Puerto Rico.\n\nIn Thursday's phone interview, he partially credited his message on immigration as a reason why he won the race, saying, \"They want to have borders, and they like people coming in, but they have to come in with love for the country. They have to come in legally.\"\n\nTrump also noted the diverse coalition of voters he attracted, pointing to gains he made among Latino voters, young voters , women and Asian American voters from 2020.\n\n\"I started to see realignment could happen because the Democrats are not in line with the thinking of the country,\" the president-elect said. \"You can't have defund the police, these kind of things. They don't want to give up and they don't work, and the people understand that.\"\n\nTrump also spoke about his phone calls with Harris and President Joe Biden since the election.\n\n\"Very nice calls, very respectful both ways,\" Trump said, describing the conversations, adding that Harris \"talked about transition, and she said she'd like it to be smooth as can be, which I agree with, of course.\"\n\nIn her concession speech at Howard University on Wednesday , Harris said she told Trump, \"We will help him and his team with their transition and that we will engage in a peaceful transfer of power.\"\n\nBiden, addressing the nation in remarks from the White House on Thursday morning, urged voters to \"accept the choice the country made\" in re-electing Trump.\n\nTrump also said that he and Biden on the phone agreed to get lunch together \"very shortly.\"\n\nHe also said he's spoken to \"probably\" 70 world leaders since Wednesday morning, including a conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which the president-elect described as \"a very good talk.\"\n\nTrump also said that he spoke with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but didn't divulge additional details about that conversation.\n\nHe added that he had not yet spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but \"I think we'll speak.\"\n\nOver the course of the campaign, Trump promised to end Russia's war with Ukraine if elected, saying in September that he would negotiate a deal \" that's good for both sides. \"\n\nRead more from NBC News:\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

It is also unclear how many applicants have been impacted.\n\nOne of the orders issued by Trump directs agencies to \"vet and screen to the maximum degree possible all aliens who intend to be admitted, enter, or are already inside the United States, particularly those aliens coming from regions or nations with identified security risks.\"\n\nThey are also required to \"determine the information needed from any country to adjudicate any visa, admission, or other benefit under the [Immigration and Nationality Act] for one of its nationals, and to ascertain whether the individual seeking the benefit is who the individual claims to be and that the individual is not a security or public-safety threat,\" the order stipulates.\n\nA U.S. appeals court ruled on Tuesday that the Trump administration can stop approving new refugees for entry into the United States but has to allow in people who were conditionally accepted before the president suspended the nation's refugee admissions system.\n\nThe three-judge panel of the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the president has the power to restrict people from entering the country, pointing to a 2018 Supreme Court ruling upholding Trump's ban on travel from several countries during his first term."

Thus, ORR must update the Foundational Rule ... effective immediately.\"\n\nThe change means that ORR can share information about the immigration status of potential unaccompanied minor sponsors with law enforcement and immigration enforcement officials.\n\n\"In addition to revising existing rules, FAIR believes that Congress must reform [Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act] and the Flores Settlement to stop the illegal migration and exploitation of minors,\" Mehlman told The Epoch Times in an email, referring to a settlement that set rules around the caring for and release of unaccompanied minors.\n\nSeveral groups that have been critical of the Trump administration's actions on immigration, including the American Immigration Council, did not respond to requests for comment on the rule change."

Without it, she warned, border crossings are likely to surge again before DHS can regain operational control.\n\nSince Trump returned to office in January, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has arrested 32,809 illegal immigrants and deported 29,033, according to data cited in the DHS notice.\n\nOf those arrested, 14,111 had prior criminal convictions, 9,980 had pending criminal charges, 1,155 were confirmed gang members, and 39 were known or suspected terrorists.\n\nThe surge in enforcement has strained detention capacity. As of March 13, ICE held 47,372 detainees, or nearly 87 percent of its maximum 54,500-bed capacity.\n\n\"ICE's priority for detention space is removing aliens with criminal records, public safety risks, and national security risks,\" the DHS notice states. \"Should this finding not be extended, ICE would be hampered in this critical effort.\"\n\nHowever, following a legal challenge, a federal court issued a preliminary injunction at the end of February and a protective order in March, significantly restricting ICE activity in or near places of worship.\n\nIn addition, the Department of Justice (DOJ) issued a directive in January allowing ICE officers to make arrests inside immigration court facilities, reversing a Biden-era restriction.\n\nTren de Aragua has become a focal point of Trump's immigration and national security strategy. On March 15, the president invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798-a rarely used wartime law-and designated members of the gang as \"alien enemies\" working in coordination with the Venezuelan regime. The proclamation allows for immediate arrest and deportation without standard due process, a move that has drawn legal challenges."

Another more than 43,000 unaccompanied minors who were provided with notices to appear failed to appear for scheduled hearings, which can trigger a deportation order from a judge.\n\nThe issues stemmed from ICE not always receiving information about the location of sponsors for the unaccompanied children from HHS and other federal agencies, as well as limited staffing to monitor the cases and no policy requiring officers to monitor the cases, the report stated.\n\n\"Without an ability to monitor the location and status of [the children], ICE is unable to facilitate court appearances and has no assurance [the children] are safe from trafficking, exploitation, forced labor, or involvement in criminal activities that may pose a risk to local communities,\" the inspector general said.\n\nInvestigators with Cuffari's office interviewed more than 140 officials, primarily from ICE and other agencies, and reviewed data for the report.\n\nThe inspector general issued four recommendations, including advising ICE to develop and implement a plan to get through the backlog of unaccompanied children needing notices to appear in court.\n\nICE concurred with all four recommendations and said that it is estimated the agency will complete the recommended work by Sept. 30, or the end of the fiscal year.\n\nJennifer Cleary, a senior ICE official, said in a letter to Cuffari that ICE is committed to working with partners to ensure unaccompanied minors are safely transferred from the Department of Homeland Security to HHS.\n\nHHS, ICE, and the Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment."

      "text": "How Trump Admin Widens Scope of Federal Agency Involvement in Immigration Enforcement\n\nThe Trump administration's focus on immigration enforcement has led multiple government agencies, including the IRS and the departments of State, Defense, and Justice, as well as the military, to expand their immigration-related activities beyond the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\n\nTraditional measures were prioritized by DHS and Customs and Border Protection after President Donald Trump's emergency declaration relating to the southern border.\n\nSince implementing the new policy, ICE arrests of criminal illegal immigrants have doubled, and the agency's arrests of fugitives at large have tripled, according to the DHS.\n\nUnder the last Bush administration, active-duty military and National Guard members were sent to the southern border of the United States to assist Border Patrol agents.\n\nICE has received significant assistance from the United States Air Force in deporting illegal immigrants by air. So far, at least 26 military flights have been used for deportation.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio's first professional international trip was to Central America to broker deals with Guatemala, Panama, and El Salvador regarding illegal immigrants in the United States.\n\nOne aspect of the deals he made involves those nations accepting not only their citizens but also deportees from other nations that have been less cooperative with the United States's request.\n\nSome of the higher-ranking officials at the State Department are familiar with the turmoil surrounding the issue of immigration, including Christopher Landau, Trump's choice for Rubio's deputy. Landau was the U.S. ambassador to Mexico from 2019 to 2021 and assisted with the first Trump administration's Remain in Mexico policy.\n\nBondi has made it clear that cities and states unwilling to work with federal agents on immigration enforcement, including assistance with identification and enforcement of deportation, would be targeted by the DOJ.\n\n\"This is a new DOJ, we are taking steps to protect Americans,\" Bondi said while announcing a lawsuit against New York state, the New York attorney general, and the governor over a state law that allows people who may not be in the United States legally to obtain driver's licenses.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services has also suspended a program that was providing legal services to children who entered the country illegally.\n\nThe Treasury Department's Internal Revenue Service has helped identify employers who have hired illegal immigrants.\n\nIn his Jan. 20 executive order \"Protecting the American People Against Invasion,\" the president stated: \"Enforcing our Nation's immigration laws is critically important to the national security and public safety of the United States. The American people deserve a Federal Government that puts their interests first and a Government that understands its sacred obligation to prioritize the safety, security, and financial and economic well-being of Americans.\""

      "text": "In 2018, I published Melting Pot or Civil War? , a short book on immigration. Despite its provocative title, the book offered a cautious, careful, almost hilariously mild case for immigration restriction. Having closely followed how countries around the world had handled, and more often mis handled, immigration, I laid out a road map for Making Immigration Great Again. Among other things, I called for rebalancing immigrant admissions toward the young and skilled; rejecting identitarian ideologies that undermined immigrant assimilation and sowed racial resentment; embracing labor-saving automation as an imperfect substitute for low-wage migrant labor; and investing in low-income youth.\n\nIf this sounds like a boringly centrist Davos Man manifesto, I don't disagree.\n\nKeep in mind, though, that I wrote the book in the thick of the Donald Trump-era immigration wars, when the rhetorical temperature was high and public opinion was as pro-immigration as it had ever been. Against a backdrop of family separations, attempted Muslim bans, and anxious Dreamers, it felt taboo to even suggest that Steve Bannon and friends might be half-right about the wisdom of opening our borders, especially in my small, hyper-educated, blue state-parody world.\n\nNo posts"

      "text": "It's Monday, February 24. This is The Front Page , your daily window into the world of The Free Press -and our take on the world at large. Coming up: The cost of abandoning Ukraine. The Gulf of. . . Florida? Elon asks government workers what they did last week. Podcaster named as deputy head of the FBI. And more.\n\nBut first: It's not a guten morgen for Germany's center-left.\n\nThe polls predicted an electoral earthquake in Germany's elections-and that is exactly what voters in Europe's largest economy delivered on Sunday .\n\nTurnout was at its highest since reunification . The right-wing populist party, Alternative for Germany (AfD), doubled its vote share and finished second. Chancellor Olaf Scholz's center-left Social Democratic Party (SDP) slumped to an all-time low. And the center-right CDU/CSU bloc came top, with their leader, Friedrich Merz, poised to take over as chancellor.\n\nNever before in Germany's postwar history has a party other than the CDU and the SDP finished in the top two in the Bundestag election. The message from the result is stark, writes Christopher Caldwell in The Free Press today: \"German voters have decided that stopping mass immigration, legal and illegal, is a national emergency.\"\n\nGermany is far from the only Western democracy in which voters' anger at high rates of immigration-and an elite refusal to grapple with the issue-has driven its politics. But, for obvious historical reasons, the rise of a right-wing, populist party brings with it added apprehension in Germany.\n\nThat's part of the reason why the German electorate isn't quite ready to give up on its establishment parties. The math in the Bundestag means Merz will likely end up in a grand coalition with the SDP-the same governing arrangement that kept Angela Merkel in power for so long. The question, though, is whether the next chancellor can use that power to fix the issue that has voters so angry.\n\nAs Caldwell puts it in his piece for us: \"A majority of Germans want him to carry out the AfD's policies-but without the AfD.\" That will not be straightforward, he argues.\n\nTo find out why, read on: \" The German Establishment's Last Chance .\"\n\nICYMI: The German election has garnered plenty of American attention-some of it from better-informed sources than others. A particularly dumb take on German democracy-and history-came from Face the Nation 's Margaret Brennan, who recently described the rise of the Nazis as an example of \"where free speech was weaponized to conduct a genocide.\" That is-obviously-not exactly what happened. But for the avoidance of doubt, we asked historian and Winston Churchill biographer Andrew Roberts to set the record straight.\n\nRead Roberts: \" The Nazis Did Not 'Weaponize' Free Speech. They Crushed It .\"\n\nThe Cost of Abandoning Ukraine\n\nOver the past month, the Trump administration has rapidly overturned U.S. policy toward Ukraine. Trump has called the Ukrainian president a dictator , demanded Ukraine pay back U.S. aid by handing over the country's vast rare earth mineral resources, and left the country's leaders out of direct negotiations with Russia. Just yesterday, Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff said that Russia should not necessarily be blamed for starting the war , a position in sync with the president's online tirade against Volodymyr Zelensky last week.\n\nFree Press senior editor Peter Savodnik knows a little something about Ukraine. His ancestors fled the country, and he's spent two decades covering America's impact on the country, from the Orange Revolution in 2004 to the government's campaign to rehabilitate alcoholic bears (like real ones, not the big, hairy, gay guys you might catch stumbling around Provincetown ).\n\nToday, on the third anniversary of the war, Peter writes that Trump's approach to Ukraine isn't just a shift-it's a betrayal, and not just of Ukraine, but of America, too.\n\nRead \" My Ancestors Fled Ukraine. It Was America That Allowed Me to Return .\"\n\nNew Yorkers Hold Memorial for Terrorist Leader They Can't Name\n\nOn September 27, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli air strike. Yesterday afternoon, as tens of thousands gathered in Beirut for his funeral, a few dozen New Yorkers gathered to commemorate the terrorist in Manhattan. Free Press ers Maya Sulkin and Josh Code were there to report on it.\n\n\"The strangest thing about this vigil was not its lack of ceremony or prayer, but that very few of the 100 or so in attendance knew who Nasrallah was.\"\n\nRead their report: \" New York's Vigil for That Terrorist-What's His Name? \"\n\n\"Maybe They Should Call It the Gulf of Florida\"\n\nOn Inauguration Day, Trump signed an executive order changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. Many people aren't happy. But what do people living on the Gulf Coast actually think about the change? Last weekend, I drove down to Pensacola Beach to ask. Do Floridians prefer Gulf of Mexico or Gulf of America? And is there a secret third option we haven't yet considered?\n\nWatch the video below.\n\nAn email with the subject line \"What did you do last week?\" was sent to all federal employees on Saturday. It was DOGE's latest move-with Musk posting to X that all government workers had to respond to the email listing five things they accomplished the week prior. Musk noted, \"Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation.\" Three agencies-the State Department, the FBI, and the Department of Defense-told workers to ignore the email, sowing greater tension between Musk and federal employees and raising questions over DOGE's power to follow through on its demands.\n\nTrump ousted his top military officer , General Charles Q. Brown Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and five other senior Pentagon officials in a long-anticipated Friday night purge. His firings were especially controversial given the nonpartisan role the top military brass has traditionally played. Trump replaced General Brown with Lieutenant General Dan \"Razin\" Caine, a retired, lower-ranking officer who Trump views as a loyalist who will fight against DEI within the department. Hegseth said , \"Under President Trump, we are putting in place new leadership that will focus our military on its core mission of deterring, fighting, and winning wars.\"\n\nBritish prime minister Keir Starmer and French president Emmanuel Macron plan to visit Trump this week to discuss the Ukraine war and to try and repair a bruised transatlantic alliance. The two face an uphill battle in aligning with Trump on the war, as he recently said the two \"haven't done anything\" about Ukraine. Macron plans to tell Trump that \"You can't be weak against President Putin. It's not you, it's not your trademark, it's not in your interest.\" Zelensky, for his part, announced that he would resign as president if it brought peace to his country in what is a clear response to Trump .\n\nTrump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff announced plans to travel to Israel as the country halted its planned release of 600 Palestinian prisoners. Israel cited the way the hostages have been released by Hamas for the delayed release, calling them a \"cynical exploitation. . . for propaganda purposes.\" Witkoff will make stops in Egypt, Israel, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE as he tries to salvage last month's ceasefire deal that led to a weekly exchange of prisoners for hostages. Meanwhile, Netanyahu announced that he was seeking a \"complete demilitarization\" of southern Syria, signaling that the IDF has formalized a plan to remain there indefinitely.\n\nRFK Jr., newly sworn in as secretary of Health and Human Services, was given a mandate to investigate the use of antidepressants and weight-loss drugs over the weekend. Trump moved to form a \"Make America Healthy Again\" commission, empowering RFK to study SSRIs, chronic disease, and lifestyle alternatives to drugs like Ozempic in treating obesity, which he has said can be cured with \"good food.\" Fair enough, just don't let him get his paws on the Diet Coke, please.\n\nPope Francis remains in critical condition as of Sunday evening. The pontiff was hospitalized for a severe respiratory illness, which now is compounded by mild kidney failure. The Vatican said Francis was \"alert and well oriented\" as the pope told his doctors that he was aware of his own fragility. Catholics around the world prayed for his health, with Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York saying in a Sunday sermon that \"As our Holy Father, Pope Francis is in very, very fragile health and probably close to death.\"\n\nTrump has nominated conservative podcaster Dan Bongino as deputy director of the FBI. A one-time Secret Service agent, Bongino once quipped \" My life is all about owning the libs ,\" and is currently engaged in a long-running feud with horror author Stephen King on X. Never a dull day in this crazy country.\n\nIt's so interesting to me that federal employees think they can't be let go or fired from their jobs.  Where do they get that idea? How many people work for the federal government?   Around 3 million. Think about that.   43% of people in Washington D.C. work for the federal government.Average federal employee salaries exceed 80,000 in all states.  The pay raise for civilian federal employees increased by an average of 4.6% in 2023.  Civilian federal employees saw their pay increase by 5.2% in 2024.   Are all these folks necessary for our government to do what it's  tasked with doing? Between 2005 and 2023 the lowest number of layoffs per year in any sector was the Federal government at 183K  All these figures can be found in USA FACTS at usafats.org .\n\nNo Coke.

      "text": "It's Wednesday, November 20. This is The Front Page , your daily window into the world of The Free Press -and our take on the world at large. Coming up: Why Yale students envy their conservative peers, Andrew Doyle on The Guardian's misinformation hypocrisy, Olivia Reingold presents gripping evidence from Daniel Penny's trial, and much more.\n\nBut first: Reihan Salam on how to fix our immigration system.\n\nIt's easy to think of immigration-one of the top issues this election-as an unsolvable problem, with chaos at the border, millions of illegal immigrants now settled in America, and toxic political debate on the issue. But that's too pessimistic, says Reihan Salam , president of the Manhattan Institute and author of our lead story today.\n\nReihan knows the issue can inspire strong feelings. The son of Bangladeshi immigrants, he wrote a book on immigration published during Trump's first term that was labeled \"completely off the rails\" by progressive critics. But, in fact, he's one of the most level-headed experts on the issue.\n\nAs Reihan writes, \"I have spent much of my adult life thinking about how to balance the economic and cultural dynamism that comes from immigration against the need to control ethnic tensions, protect American workers, assimilate newcomers, and maintain an orderly process that commands legitimacy and respect.\"\n\nHe lists ten priorities for the incoming Trump administration in his essay, \" Immigration Is a Mess. Here's How to Fix It. \"\n\nBluesky's the Limit\n\nLast week, I wrote about a sudden outbreak of Trump Derangement Syndrome: sex strikes, women shaving their heads, Harris voters calling ICE on the family members of Trump-supporting Latinos, and more. But what happens once the postelection freakout subsides? What do TDS sufferers plan to do for the next four years? Will they lock themselves in a padded cell, convincing each other that they are just too good for this rotten world? Or will they take the shock of this election as a wake-up call about the bubble they're living in?\n\nMorning Joe hosts and longtime Trump critics Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski appear to be taking the latter route. On Monday, they revealed they had visited Mar-a-Lago last week to \" restart communications \" with the president-elect. Behind the Nixon-to-China tone, it was hard to tell whether it was a genuine olive branch, a ploy to avoid retribution , or even a desperate bid for access to the Trump White House. Whatever their motive, many of their viewers and guests aren't happy about it. Washington Post columnist and MSNBC contributor Jennifer Rubin is promoting a boycott . And one anonymous MSNBC staffer told Fox News that the \"rank and file\" are now \"largely disdainful\" of the network's morning stars. In other words: Stay in your liberal bubble, folx!\n\nMore signs of staying in the bubble: Many anti-Trump X users have left the platform and joined Bluesky in the days since the election. Bluesky, which was created by Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, is positioning itself as a digital sanctuary for people horrified by Trump and his new best friend, X CEO Elon Musk. About 115,000 X accounts were deleted the day after the November 5 election alone. At the same time, Bluesky has seen a surge of at least four million new accounts, according to the site's CEO Jay Graber . Celebrities such as Stephen King, Barbra Streisand, and even Flavor Flav have flocked to the platform.\n\nAnd so has one of the biggest liberal papers in the English language: The Guardian . In a statement explaining the reasons behind the move, the British paper cited \"the often disturbing content promoted or found on the platform, including far-right conspiracy theories and racism.\"\n\nBut, as Andrew Doyle points out in our second story today, The Guardian has produced plenty of nonsense on its own: from claiming that a flashing incident by a sex offender at an L.A. spa was a transphobic lie to misinformation about Doyle himself. Nonetheless, Doyle thinks the paper leaving X will only make things worse. \"Online echo chambers are, of course, largely to blame for the escalation of political tribalism that we have seen in recent years,\" he writes. \"And also for the sense of shock that many experience when elections don't go their way.\"\n\nRead Andrew Doyle on \" The Guardian's Retreat from the Battlefield of Ideas .\"\n\nYale Students: We're Jealous of Conservatives\n\nBut not everyone has their heads in the sand. In a piece we're publishing today, a group of students at Yale admit they feel intellectually stifled by the homogeneous ideas on their campus. They even go as far as to say they are jealous of their conservative peers.\n\nWhy? Because conservative students are \"forced to square their opinions with the progressive supermajority.\" That may be challenging, \"but it cultivates resilience, critical reflection, and the capacity to find community amid disagreement,\" they argue. Ivy League campuses are supposed to be the most out of touch liberal bubbles of all, so this missive from the future leaders of the liberal elite is a reminder that all is not lost.\n\nRead the full op-ed from a group of Yale students who say \" We're Jealous of Our Conservative Peers. \"\n\nDaniel Penny's First Interrogation: \"I'm Not Trying to Kill the Guy\"\n\nOn May 1, 2023, Daniel Penny became a national lightning rod when he placed Jordan Neely, a homeless black man widely described as \"threatening\" by witnesses, into a chokehold on the New York City subway. Neely died within hours, and the case quickly became a political Rorschach test , with Penny seen by some as a hero and by others as a racially motivated murderer. Eighteen months later, Penny is on trial for manslaughter and Olivia Reingold has been covering the courtroom drama for The Free Press. Today, she brings us a piece of video evidence that gets to the heart of why this case has captivated America. Here's Olivia:\n\nA few hours after the incident on the F train, Daniel Penny accompanied police back to their Chinatown headquarters. In footage of his interrogation, shown as part of the prosecution's case in his ongoing manslaughter trial and obtained by The Free Press , Penny seems to think he's at the police precinct to tell them about the \"lunatic\" who \"started threatening people\" on the train. The conversation starts out in a friendly tone. But as the questioning continues, Penny appears to realize that these aren't just any police officers. And they don't consider him a Good Samaritan, but a criminal suspect.\n\n\"Some guy came on, and he, like, whipped his jacket off, and he's like, 'I'm going to kill everybody,' \" Penny tells the officers in a tiny, windowless room. \"He was acting like a lunatic, like a crazy person.\"\n\nPenny, then 24 years old and a former Marine, even waives his rights to an attorney and to remain silent, ostensibly because he thinks he has nothing to hide. But then the questions begin-and they're not about Neely, a schizophrenic with a long arrest record. They're about him.\n\nWe have distilled the interrogation, which spanned nearly thirty minutes, into an eight-minute compilation that shows the central tension of the case Penny now faces: Is he a hero who stepped in to rescue a train full of mothers, teenagers, and children-or a dangerous vigilante who attacked a black homeless man \"because he felt like he could,\" as a woman who's been watching the trial every day recently told me? Penny doesn't know yet that Neely, who paramedics transported to a nearby hospital, has died. But one senses that he understands his life has changed forever. Watch for yourself:\n\nVladimir Putin lowered the threshold for Russia's use of nuclear weapons Tuesday, two days after the Biden administration approved Ukraine's use of American-supplied long-range missiles. The new doctrine allows for a nuclear response by Russia to a conventional attack by an adversary, if that adversary is supported by a nuclear power. \"If the long-range missiles are used from the territory of Ukraine against the Russian territory, it will mean that they are controlled by American military experts and we will view that as a qualitatively new phase of the Western war against Russia and respond accordingly,\" said Russian foreign minister Segei Lavrov. Moscow also said yesterday it had shot down four America-supplied missiles in Russia. An anonymous U.S. National Security Council official told the AP that the White House was not surprised by Putin's decision and that the U.S. sees no change to Russia's nuclear posture.\n\nTrump has picked Howard Lutnick as his nominee for commerce secretary. The CEO of financial services firm Cantor Fitzgerald and co-chair of the president-elect's transition team had been talked about as a treasury secretary contender, with Musk backing him for that job last week. Commerce will be an especially big job in the next administration, with tariffs at the top of Trump's economic agenda. And Lutnick has been a loyal defender of Trump's plans-both on Wall Street and in the media.\n\nWhen progressives use \"woke\" language, most Americans have no idea what they're talking about. It's a point some moderate Democrats have made since their electoral shellacking, and it's backed up by a new poll by YouGov . A majority of adults say they have never even heard the term BIPOC , and just 5 percent of people say they use the term Latinx . The survey also finds that just 15 percent of black Americans use the term anti-racism , while only 47 percent have heard the term at all.\n\nThe Berlin chief of police warned Jews and gay people to hide their identities in Arab neighborhoods. \"There are certain neighborhoods where the majority of people of Arab origin live, who also have sympathies for terrorist groups,\" she said. Almost 90 years after the terror of Kristallnacht, physical threats toward Jews and gay couples have surged again in Germany.\n\nVenezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado has called on Donald Trump to increase pressure on her country and reinstate sanctions undone by the Biden administration, in hopes of ousting President Nicolás Maduro. Machado, known as the Iron Lady, is currently in hiding somewhere in Venezuela, but has said that if Trump were to help oust the leftist authoritarian, it would be \"an enormous foreign policy victory in the very, very short term.\"\n\nPro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong have been sentenced and jailed -some up to ten years-for the role they played in holding an unofficial primary election in 2020. The 47 people arrested-two of whom have since been acquitted-are among the most prominent figures standing up to Beijing's crackdown on political dissent. Hours before their sentencing, one protester published a statement that she had been punished for taking part in \"the last free and fair election in Hong Kong.\" Read Bari Weiss's 2021 essay on Jimmy Lai, the imprisoned newspaper owner and a hero of Hong Kong democracy: \" When a Free Society Becomes a Police State. \"\n\nAn \" unknown and unauthorized third party \" has gained access to two dozen depositions related to various investigations into former Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, Trump's nominee for attorney general. The hacked materials include the sworn deposition of a minor who allegedly had sex with Gaetz. Earlier this year, the House Ethics Committee investigated allegations that the former congressman engaged in sexual misconduct and illicit drug use, among other accusations. Their findings have not yet been released, but the Justice Department declined to bring charges against him last year.\n\nJust months after failing to stop a mysterious weirdo from shooting Donald Trump in the ear, the Secret Service has deployed a creepy robot dog to patrol Mar-a-Lago. Created by Boston Dynamics, \"Spot\" is unarmed but can be used to surveil the property either remotely or automatically so long as the route is preprogrammed. Still unclear: How is this canine Roomba better than an actual dog?\n\nRiver Page is a reporter at The Free Press. Read his recent piece \" The Smearing of Gay Republicans ,\" and follow him on X @river_is_nice .\n\nDaniel Penny is a HERO and anyone who thinks differently should imagine how it felt to be in that subway car, closed in w/a remorseless maniac out for blood or worse.\n\nRegarding the Daniel Penny story.  Besides the police conning this sincere young man to incriminate himself, I wonder about the 'story'.  We get a cursory introduction, then a video, and that's it.  I go, huh?  That's it?  How about finishing it?  No, the is not an example of the  journalism the FP brags about in self-congratulatory writings.\n\nNo posts"

It's an issue that has vexed politicians for decades, and it's not hard to understand why.\n\nUnder the Biden administration, an average of two million undocumented migrants crossed the border annually until this year, recalling levels not seen since the '90s . Illegal immigration, and Trump's promise to \"Build the Wall,\" were centerpieces of his first, second, and now third presidential campaigns.\n\nI arrived in Phoenix expecting a fiery conversation. And yes, in this debate, among eight participants gathered in a Methodist church, all with different views on immigration, there was plenty of intense disagreement. But there was also a surprising amount of common ground.\n\nFor all the divisive rhetoric around immigration, my sense is that most Americans are searching for a middle ground-somewhere between an effectively open border and a system that, long before Donald Trump came along, enacted needlessly cruel policies on some of the world's most vulnerable people.\n\nThe ideologically diverse group on this week's episode of Swing State Debates includes two DACA recipients, a former border patrol agent, an immigration attorney, and a Trump-supporting advocate for immigrant families. We talked about everything from the moral argument for a \"closed border\" and the role of drug cartels, to what policies a Trump or a Harris administration might enact vis-à-vis the border.\n\nFor all the differences of opinion on these questions there was, at the very least, some mutual understanding. And that, surely, is the point of conversations like this.\n\nYou can certainly debate what we should do as kind people to help others.  However, letting millions of unvetted people into our country is not going to look terribly kind when the terrorism starts.\n\nWe don't owe the people of other countries a living ... go back and change the country you came from\n\nNo posts"

As before, I went to the San Ysidro immigration office in San Diego, where previously my visa was easily obtained in just 30 minutes.

      "text": "The United States is home to more immigrants than any other country in the world. And debates about who (and how many people) to let in have roiled the nation since our founding. But last year, unlawful attempts to cross the southern border hit a record high of about 2.5 million.\n\nWe've all seen the videos of mothers and babies shimmying under barbed wire; of young men charging border patrol agents; and of migrant caravans marching toward Texas. The surge of migration has made even progressive cities like New York and Chicago , which previously declared themselves immigrant sanctuaries, sound the alarm.\n\nPoll after poll indicates that immigration is the top issue for voters in the 2024 election-more important than inflation or the economy. Americans left and right agree that our system is broken. But how do we fix it?\n\nThat is the subject of the first installment of our America Debates series. We convened Ann Coulter, Nick Gillespie, Sohrab Ahmari, and Cenk Uygur in Dallas for a deeper discussion about immigration.\n\nIt was spicy. Indeed, some of what the debaters said on stage may offend you. But at The Free Press, we believe the issues that matter most to Americans are worth talking about out loud, without fear. That is why we partnered with FIRE , the nation's leading defender of free speech, to bring you this debate.\n\nWe loved getting a chance to meet the more than 700 of you who showed up. For those who couldn't make it to Texas, we're thrilled to provide this film of the event:\n\nAnn Colter and Sohrab Ahmadi showed more authentic compassion with their support of firm boundaries at the border that would protect low income Americans as well as all the trafficked  migrants and vulnerable children that end up in sweat shops and worse  in American cities. And no one can deny the cartels and the poison drugs that they can easily smuggle into the country with this open border.  This is not a racist stand but one based on common sense and reality.\n\nI liked very much hearing their arguments.\n\nMy opinion: close the border firmly for now until a healthy workable doable plan is in place for vetting and then admitting the migrants who will not need welfare and can be given an actual path towards having jobs and becoming citizens.\n\nIt is obvious to any actual american that the answer to the contrived \"matter of debate\" is no.\n\nNo, we are not going to \"shut our borders\", whatever that fatuous clickbait-ready construction is supposed to mean.\n\nIt is a stupid notion. It is stupid to believe it. It is stupid to \"argue\" about it. We are not doing that. Ever.\n\nthe audience vote's \"leftward\" move by \"debate's\" end did not hint at some increased sentiment \"in favor of open borders\".\n\nit was a grudging, marginal recognition, and rejection, of rank stupidity.\n\nNo posts"

      "text": "In 2022, there were over 2.76 million illegal migrant crossings at the Southwest border. That's roughly the population of Chicago, America's third largest city. To address this unprecedented surge, President Biden recently announced tougher restrictions and made a show of visiting the border himself.\n\nBut unlike a decade or two ago, when the immigration debate was mostly about economics, today it's an issue that's subsumed by the culture wars and our polarized discourse. Republican governors bus migrants to sanctuary cities and they're called \" xenophobic \" and \" cruel \" by the left. But what happens when a Democratic governor does much the same thing, bussing migrants from Colorado to New York City and Chicago? Is it still a heartless political stunt? Or is all of this just an inevitable consequence of our broken immigration system?\n\nSo this week: a debate moderated by guest host Kmele Foster between Alex Nowrasteh and Jessica Vaughan . Are current levels of immigration helping or hurting America? How do we balance humanitarian concerns with America's economic and security needs? Should we be trying to enforce more or less restrictions at the border? And what exactly should we do to fix our immigration policies?\n\nAlex is the director of Economic and Social Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. Jessica is the director of Policy Studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that describes themselves as \"pro-immigrant but low immigration.\"\n\nWhile Alex and Jessica couldn't be more opposite in their approach-Alex favors free immigration, while Jessica argues for restrictionist policies-in this episode of Honestly we look for common ground, debate the facts, and search for solutions.\n\nDoes someone who enters the United States without clearing customs and receiving permission to enter, does such a person commit a crime?  Should people who commit crimes have consequences?  If the crime involves entering a sovereign country without permission, wouldn't the logical consequence be to be removed from that country?  Whether enforcing laws is difficult or not, shouldn't we all agree about what constitutes a crime and what doesn't?  Shouldn't we seek to enforce laws that are \"on the books?\"\n\nWhat kind of thinking makes it more complicated than this?\n\nIt has been unfortunate to see the immigration issue become such a pervasive problem to which so very few want to approach with common sense and the desire to fix a very real problem in a credible way. The back and forth between the Right and Left, with one side engaging in histrionic and the other refusing to acknowledge there's even a problem, is allowing the problem to compound itself.\n\nNo posts"

      "text": "The mass intake of foreigners has decisively failed. Can we decolonize America?\n\nRemarks delivered to NatCon 4 in Washington, DC.\n\nYou are living in an experiment.\n\nIn March of this year, the foreign-born or immigrant population in the U.S.-both legal and illegal-hit record highs.\n\nAn experiment is a test to discover if something works.\n\nThe numbers I've just described are a national experiment. And the American people are the guinea pigs.\n\nWe know this is an experiment-a test, for which we don't know the outcome-because this level of immigration is new and different in at least three ways.\n\nFirst , the scale. The amount of immigration we are experiencing is unlike anything our country has experienced before. The U.S. is home to more international migrants than any other country in the world, and more than the next four countries on the list combined . And in fact, no country in modern history has experienced numbers like these.\n\nSecond , the speed. Nine million aliens entered the country in all of the 1990s; now 10 million have entered during just the first three years of the Biden administration, with 58 percent of that increase coming as illegal immigration. This growth is far greater than even our government predictions would expect. The federal census data from 2020 predicted that the foreign-born population of the U.S. would not hit 15 percent until 2033 . Yet it is 2024 and we have already surpassed that prediction.\n\nThird , this wave of immigration is unprecedented in its diversity. Previous waves of immigration tended to come from particular parts of the world, that made absorption easier. But now, immigrants come from every corner of the globe, speak every language and dialect, worship every kind of god, and reflect every culture that exists on the planet.\n\nAnd all of this matters because immigration can only be sustained when it can be assimilated . This is not a new idea-our Founders discussed and agreed on this point. As Jefferson put it: immigrants \"should distribute themselves sparsely among the natives for quicker amalgamation.\"\n\nConsider the practical implications of immigration. Immigrants are more likely to be low-skilled compared to native-born Americans. According to one study, nearly a third of adult immigrants to the United States lack even a high school diploma . And about half of immigrants to the U.S. have limited-if any-English proficiency.\n\nSo imagine a newly-arrived immigrant to this country, who is low-skilled, has fewer than 12 years of education, speaks little (if any) English, and generally knows little about American culture, government, our Constitution, or their legal rights .\n\nOf course, that person can succeed here, and there are inspiring stories of those who have. But that person cannot succeed without a lot of help . Education, language remediation, instruction about citizenship and history, a supportive and high-trust community that is capable of conveying and reinforcing this information; plus job training; public assistance; housing assistance; healthcare assistance...the list goes on.\n\nNow multiply that one person by tens of millions .\n\nWe do not have a system for providing the help that millions of immigrants need to succeed in this country. And of course, a government confused about basic biology and incapable of fulfilling basic functions, like holding free and fair elections, is not well-equipped to assimilate tens of millions of foreign nationals.\n\nThis is different than previous generations. We are told that immigration is part of our country's heritage, so we have to accept it-but during the height of the Progressive era in the United States, American businesses who imported immigrant labor also voluntarily promoted \"Americanization.\" Henry Ford created and compelled his immigrant employees to attend 8-month English language courses and other Americanization activities, believing that it was his responsibility to teach them-and this is a quote-\"American ways, the English language, and the right way to live.\" This was not unique among American corporations, and it spread to many prominent non-profits. Eventually, 30 states enacted legislative Americanization programs.\n\nI don't have to tell you that there are no widespread \"Americanization\" efforts trying to assimilate immigrants to this country today. In fact, in the name of diversity, equity, and inclusion, \"Americanization\" efforts are actively discouraged.\n\nSo today, our country is experimenting with the massive importation of immigrants to this country, a majority of them illegal. It is an experiment because it has never been done before, and no one can assure us that it can work or that it will work .\n\nWho is running this experiment-and why?\n\nThere are two groups running this experiment.\n\nFirst, the elites in this country-the ruling class-are the ones in the position to decide whether our border is open or closed, and to what degree. And elites benefit from open borders, so that is what they choose.\n\nElites can afford home help-from private tutors to gardeners-and other services, and those things are cheaper if there is a plentiful labor class of low-skilled workers.\n\nThat's because low-skilled immigrant workers compete primarily with low-income native-born workers, who then suffer disproportionately from the effects of mass immigration. Low-income native-born workers suffer almost a 1 percent drop in income for every 1 percent increase in the immigrant composition of their industry.\n\nAnd although mass immigration has cascading negative effects throughout the economy, the elite are largely blind to them.\n\nUnsurprisingly, housing more than 51 million immigrants causes pressures on the domestic housing supply. Home prices in this country have skyrocketed, making homes now unaffordable in 80 percent of the United States. And in more than half of the U.S., home prices are accelerating faster than wages.\n\nImmigrants are straining healthcare availability throughout the country. One safety net hospital in Denver treated 20,000 illegal immigrants in 2023 alone , resulting in $10 million of uncompensated care provided.\n\nAnd immigrants are also straining schools. Again, in Denver public schools in a typical year enroll 500 illegal immigrant children, they have averaged 250 per week this year. Enormous, unplanned-for costs caused by this surge have required emergency appropriations, paying for remedial English language education and sourcing healthcare, food, and other services for immigrant minors.\n\nImmigration also stresses state and federal penal systems. According to the Department of Justice, one in five federal prisoners is an alien, and although many of them have committed immigration offenses, many more are incarcerated for other reasons. Forty-six percent of these aliens have committed drug-trafficking or other drug-related offenses and another 25 percent have committed a variety of other violent criminal offenses, like rape. I don't need to remind you of the ever-increasing number of cases of young America women raped and murdered by illegal aliens in this country. And every crime committed by someone present illegally is a preventable crime.\n\nIllegal aliens impose enormous social welfare costs on the country, receiving between $84 and $94 billion more in government benefits and services than they pay in taxes.\n\nAll of these things disadvantage low- and middle-income Americans disproportionately.\n\nAnd to add insult to injury, our current DEI regime ensures that a leg-up will be given to foreign-born candidates when they come into direct competition with native-born Americans, and most especially (though not exclusively) native-born whites.\n\nElites, however, can weather these consequences by buying their way into private healthcare, private schools, and gated neighborhoods. So for elites, open borders are all upside, and that's part of why we have them.\n\nThe other group behind our mass immigration crisis are the multiculturalists, who supply the ideological underpinnings. Multiculturalism gained ascendancy in the 1990s and has only strengthened its grip since then.\n\nMulticulturalism is an anti-Western ideology. It holds that America is composed of many distinct cultures; that the dominant Protestant Anglo culture has systemically subjugated these cultures; and that these cultures must be liberated.\n\nWhy? Because America should not have a single culture . Disunion is the express goal.\n\nMulticulturalism has completely pervaded our educational system for decades and is adopted at the highest levels of the Democrat party and the U.S. administrative state - it is even unthinkingly espoused by some Republicans.\n\nThe result is that the U.S. uniquely among all nations encourages immigrants to hold on to their language, culture, and birth country identity.\n\nAnd ever-greater numbers of immigrants only makes this easier. With greater numbers, it is easier to replicate one's home country on American soil and so avoid assimilation altogether.\n\nU.S. immigrants' countries of origin want this effect, too , and deliberately cultivate it. Wealthy nations can advocate their strategic foreign policy interests through their wealth, power, and influence. But poor countries do so by exporting people.\n\nThe net effect of elite policy preferences combined with the pathology of multiculturalism is nothing short of the colonization of America .\n\nIf you doubt, look no further than the Minnesotan Representative Ilhan Omar's now-famous rally in Minnesota just last month. She spoke Somali, to a crowd of Somali immigrants, and when the former prime minister of Somalia took the podium in support of Omar, he said her \"interests aren't those of Minnesota or the American people but those of Somalia .\"\n\nHow will a future Trump administration decolonize America?\n\nLet me be honest: I will be light on specifics here, and that's intentional. This is a time for discretion. We've seen too many of our policy ideas be announced in advance, only to be reverse-engineered by blue state attorneys general and leftist interest groups into legal challenges.\n\nBut there are two basic things to be done:\n\nIf you encounter the federal government directly and you are present here illegally, you will be sent home. Period. No got-aways-not at the border, but also not in the interior of the country. No orders of removal that are not executed.\n\nMany say that we should prioritize only the removal of criminal aliens-or violent criminal aliens-those who have raped or murdered American citizens. But such a policy essentially endorses indefinite lawlessness at our borders and makes explicit that anyone and everyone can come to the U.S. and remain in perpetuity, until they harm one of you.\n\nNo, removal is not reserved for violent criminals but is the consequence of having immigrated here illegally.\n\nAnd second, we will start making it a little \"less good\" for those present in this country illegally, by making things a little more fair for native-born Americans.\n\nRight now, illegal immigrants in many American cities are receiving two years of free housing, free healthcare, food assistance, and other benefits-benefits that have never been extended to native-born Americans, including Americans who have fought and bled for this nation in foreign conflicts.\n\nAnd illegal aliens are also competing with Americans in so many other parts of life-banking, healthcare, housing. In all of these areas, every effort must be made to serve those who are lawfully present first , in fairness.\n\nTo give you an example of what I mean: In July 2023, Florida required emergency rooms to ask patients their immigration status. And in the year that followed, Florida has experienced a 54 percent reduction in spending on emergency care through its federally-mandated Medicaid program for illegal aliens. In the words of one pro-immigration activist, Florida has experienced an \"exodus of migrants.\"\n\nWe are not the only ones discussing how to undo mass immigration and its consequences. Many Western European states, long lauded by the left for their meek acceptance of mass immigration, are now attempting to rouse the energy and the will to confront millions of unassimilated and under-employed immigrant men. Austria, Denmark, Norway, even Spain and Sweden, are moving to restore some sense of balance to their immigrant flows and some modicum of safety to their streets.\n\nIn many instances, however, these efforts are proving to be too little, too late.\n\nI know what too late looks like, and that is why I am willing to say these hard truths. I grew up in a small-scale experiment of the kind now being attempted at the national level.\n\nStockton, California, the city of my birth, was the first city in the U.S. in which more than 50 percent of the city's residents were minorities, a number that included native-born blacks and Hispanics who were already disproportionately confronted with the challenges of economic hardship, but who were now forced to compete with an enormous influx of low-skilled foreign-born migrants.\n\nThere are those who will say that it is just coincidence that today Stockton is one of the most violent jurisdictions in modern America, with consistently one of the highest per-capita homicide rates; it's just coincidence that the city is replete with long-forgotten diseases, like a 55 percent spike in tuberculosis just this year; it's simply a coincidence that, despite its high crime-rate and persistent joblessness, Stockton has some of the most unaffordable housing in America.\n\nBut it's not a coincidence.\n\nStockton is a precursor of a kind of community springing up all around our nation: a community where ordinary American citizens-black, white, brown-are made to feel unwelcome in their own neighborhoods, alienated from their own country.\n\nThe immigrants who survive a place like Stockton are those who work hard, privilege education, speak English, and love this country.\n\nAnd while I appreciate the knowledge I gained about the architecture of Angkor Wat, the food of the Mayas, and the Zodiac tradition of Lunar New Year, my classmates and I would have been better served to learn the story of this nation's founding, to be Americanized.\n\nThe Stockton \"experiment,\" which has been an unmitigated disaster, proves why the only solution is to decolonize America .\n\nThere is no sustainable way to absorb the immigration this country has experienced and remain a cohesive polity.\n\nAlready, though, the corporate media are suggesting that the very thought of deporting anyone is racist and genocidal.\n\nBut I've explained the experiment to you. And I think we are far enough along for the facts to give us a good idea of how it will come out.\n\nPat Buchanan once asked whether in an age of mass immigration we can truly say we are still one nation and one unified people.\n\nIt is a question we should still be asking today.\n\nWe cannot live solely on the memory of our republic.\n\nMass immigration, left unchecked and without consequence, will only continue. And it will remain incompatible with America as we once knew it and hope to know it again. It is profoundly unfair to millions of Americans in this country, who have been pushed aside for the arrival of millions of aliens, all in the service of elite policy preferences and the ideology of multiculturalism.\n\nIt is time not just to end mass immigration, but to reverse it . To rediscover American culture, not multi-culture.\n\nTo decolonize and then re-Americanize this country.\n\nTheo Wold serves as the director of the Administrative State Project at the Claremont Institute.\n\nThis is not a paywall!\n\nYour support helps us continue our mission of providing thoughtful, independent journalism.

      "text": "While there are sympathetic points to the tech billionaires' H-1B stance, it would be a mistake to miss the restrictionist moment.\n\nMost people have nuanced views on immigration. That includes President-elect Donald Trump, whose political resilience is in no small part a product of the American electorate's rejection of open borders. Yet the man who led chants of \"build the wall\" and has spoken hyperbolically at times about Muslim immigration has been noticeably slow to rein in his tech bro pals on H-1B visas, though they have done some backtracking of their own .\n\nThe Trump phenomenon is at its best an attempt to push back against the excesses of proposition-nation talk, treating America as a real place that is the home of real people and not just an abstraction . You can, of course, push too far in the opposite direction, and some Trump allies do-particularism has excesses that are as ugly as universalism can be divorced from reality-but most Trump voters take the words inscribed on the Statue of Liberty seriously, not literally .\n\nIn other words, you can simultaneously believe the immigration has enriched the American experience and been an important part of this country's story without rejecting the need for an orderly border and strong mutual bonds of citizenship. As the founders of this magazine once put it , \"We believe that America has gained and still does from new immigrants. But we also, after two decades of intense immigration, believe that the nation needs a slowdown to assimilate those already here.\"\n\nExcept you can now revise that to more than four decades of intense immigration, much of it illegal, with the biggest surge in U.S. history taking place under President Joe Biden. The Biden border crisis was sparked in part by the view that wealthy, historically Western countries do not have the right to keep out migrants who outscore (some of) the native-born on various intersectionality tests. Similar cultural self-doubt has plagued our allies in Europe and elsewhere, often leading to political upheaval.\n\nMost Americans, including vast numbers of citizens and lawful permanent residents of recent immigrant stock, reject this idea in theory. Even more reject it in practice, as it leads to chaos and strained social services, often most acutely felt in homegrown communities of color. That's how Trump broke George W. Bush's record (for a Republican presidential nominee) Hispanic vote share despite speaking rather differently about immigration, bilingualism, and multiculturalism.\n\nThe broken border has prompted the American people to contemplate deportation programs that might have triggered blowback as recently as Trump's first term. The Biden administration itself has quietly had to step up deportations , even as the outgoing president once said that Barack Obama's deporter-in-chief posture -adopted to build credibility for a congressionally enacted amnesty-was a \" big mistake .\"\n\nThe big mistake was really allowing the transfer of wealth and power from the working class to a globalized elite under the guise of woke language. If liberals are vulnerable to defending the importation of a cheap, perpetually marginalized servant class on these grounds, conservatives and libertarians easily fall victim to descriptions of programs like H-1B as some kind of pure free-market solution to American labor problems.\n\nElon Musk is a centrist Democrat who became a relatively recent convert to libertarianism. Vivek Ramaswamy is younger, but he is a more entrenched representative of America First's more libertarian wing. Saved By the Bell references aside, in another context much of his recent cultural commentary would have been at home in conservative (and neoconservative) publications since at least the 1980s. And while vastly oversimplified, it isn't wrong in every particular.\n\nRamaswamy and especially Musk played important roles in getting Trump reelected. Their Department of Government Efficiency could play a crucial role in his administration. Trump himself, as I've written before, mixed populist and nationalist instincts about foreign cheating with the sensibilities of a pre-Reagan moderate business Republican. It's no wonder he's less of a systematic thinker on immigration policy than Stephen Miller.\n\nBut it will be a variation of the same error Biden made, and given the multiracial working-class coalition that elected Trump in 2024 potentially a far graver one, to accept the bizarre argument that solidarity with one's fellow citizens when evaluating foreign-worker programs is somehow closer to DEI than conservatism. It would at least represent the latest triumph of sloganeering over thinking on immigration policy.\n\nW.

      "text": "Self-proclaimed America Firsters can subscribe to elite theory or wish to open the floodgates on skilled immigration, but not both.\n\nThere are clarifying moments in the history of a movement. Donald Trump's electoral victory has left the \"New Right\" coalition-an unhappy moniker in a number of ways, not least in that it used to be applied to the movement it allegedly replaces-in possession of the field, which means its constituents can turn their attention to the important business of bickering over the spoils.\n\nThe current stars of the movement are Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, both recent converts from being center-left Democrats, who, having considered the problems of the nation and the world, have settled on the novel solution of checking government waste, fraud, and abuse. ( Why has no one ever thought of this before? ) The dyad, along with the incoming administration's AI czar, David Sacks, has backed the incoming AI advisor Sriram Krishnan's suggestion that caps on H1B visa numbers for Indian engineers be done away with. The argument is that hoovering up foreign talent will cement the American tech industry's supremacy, and that this is an \"America First\" outcome. The camisas viejas , on the other hand, have noted that this is (gently put) in tension with the immigration restrictionist rhetoric traditionally associated with the phrase.\n\nRamaswamy, to his credit, got out ahead of the clash this summer , identifying within the America First coalition a tension or dispute between \"National Libertarianism\"-which is free-trade, pro-immigration, anti-state power, and basically looks an awful lot like fusionism with an injection of foreign-policy realism-and \"National Conservatism,\" which is protectionist, anti-immigration, pro-state power, and basically looks an awful lot like paleoconservatism without its traditional moral streak (or its skepticism of Israel, let alone of every former Warsaw Pact country that comes hat-in-hand to American political conferences). Ramaswamy weighed in Thursday about visa workers on X with a long post, almost a screed, about why companies prefer foreign skilled labor to American. The upshot: Americans are lazy and aspire to mediocrity. Well, then.\n\nThe New Right (including Ramaswamy ) has spent a lot of time and ink jabbering about elite theory-elite overproduction, counterelites, meritocracy, and so on. This isn't a knock; we're not above it ourselves . You have to do some pretty footwork to shoehorn this into what everyone insists is the \"populist moment,\" but columnists need to eat. On the H1B question, we'd put a little catechism to the pro side: Does a nation have a culture-a set of shared public norms of behavior, language, belief? Does a nation have an interest in preserving the continuity of its culture? Does America in particular have an interest in preserving its own culture? Are there greater or lesser differences between one culture and various others? Do large groups of people from outside a place tend to be more resistant to assimilation than smaller such groups? Do elites have disproportionate influence over a culture?\n\nIt is not \" racist \" to suggest that people in places like India have significant cultural differences from Americans, perhaps greater than the cultural differences of people from Norway or Chile. India never underwent the formative experiences of modern Western countries: the secularization of Christian principles, the wars of religion, the liberal revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries, the rise of nationalism. Instead, it has its own distinct set of formative historical moments; much of the modern nation's history has been dominated by efforts to digest Western theoretical constructs like economic planning and the nation-state, not to mention its own wars of religion and the postcolonial hangover. It would be strange if different historical matrices didn't result in tangible differences of culture, not all of them easily reconcilable or particularly welcome. The left's own felt need to legislate against caste discrimination is one instructive example.\n\nWorking-class immigrants have more incentive to assimilate than elites-that is, they tend to have less choice. This is borne out by historical experience. The second-wave immigrant groups were predominantly working-class. By the third generation, their descendants had mostly become monolingual English-speakers, were integrated into mainstream American civil society structures, and so on. (This is not to say that there weren't persistent difficulties in their assimilation, like Italian organized crime and the Irish penchant for public disorder, still on full display every March 17 on Boston's T.) Elite immigrants, particularly if they are in groups large enough to maintain their native cultures internally, are in a position to change culture to fit their own predilections rather than to assimilate. If, as Ramaswamy suggests, an innate poverty of spirit lies at the heart of American culture-that is, if his answer answer to question 3 above (\"Does America in particular have an interest in preserving its own culture?\") is \"no,\" as it seems to be-maybe that's a good thing. I would suggest, though, that such an argument is not an especially America First cut.\n\nThere are few absolute evils in statesmanship. Skilled immigrants may provide a stopgap for acute labor shortages in strategic industries-the ongoing drama of the TSMC fab in Arizona comes to mind. Yet it seems feckless to pretend that large, monied, prestigious immigrant groups will not exert strong and unexpected influences over American culture, some perhaps good, some perhaps ill. America Firsters, particularly while they have a mandate to step back from the revolutionary immigration policies of the left, should be skeptical of calls for a fresh round of uncontrolled population composition experiments.\n\nJude Russo is the managing editor of The American Conservative and a contributing editor of The New York Sun .

There's little more Biden can do about number 1, and little he seems to want to do about number 3, but on immigration still-President Joe will leave quite a record for Vice President Kamala Harris to drag into November.\n\nThe problem is that Biden has been obsessed with immigration. He is obsessed with finding new ways to bring more migrants to the U.S.-some of his tricks resulted in tens of thousands of people entering, others just a few hundred. The numbers seemed to matter less than the process. Such is obsession. Harris seems not to share his zeal, but inherits it as a legacy (and an electoral problem) just the same.\n\nHarris's problem began on the southern border, where practically concurrent with taking office, Joe threw open the doors. The Trump campaign is already releasing ads tying Harris to these Biden policies. \"If you ever wondered how Joe Biden could get the border so screwed up. Remember, he had help,\" a narrator reads in one ad. \"Here's Biden appointing Kamala Harris to be his border czar to deal with illegal immigration. And here are a record number of illegal immigrants.\"\n\nUnder the Obama administration the standard was about 1,000 attempted crossings a day. By the time the Trump administration ended, the U.S. was deporting more people than were illegally coming into the country. In less than a month under Biden, the number of people illegally coming into the country shot up to more than 6,000 per day. Even with Biden's most recent executive order cutting back on immigration, up to 2,500 crossings are still allowed each day. For the past three years, Biden policy allowed nearly 6,000 asylum seekers to illegally cross the border daily, seven days a week. That number meant the southern border alone produced an average 1 million immigrants every 200-odd days, a significant number given otherwise only about 1 million legal green card-type immigrants are allowed into the U.S. each year.\n\nSome 2.5 million joined the illegal population under Obama, actually slightly less than under George W. Bush. Biden broke those records in about his first 18 months in office with the wide-open southern border. More than 8 million migrants have entered the U.S. along the southern border since Biden took office in January 2021, according to Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data. That Harris was ostensibly in charge of border affairs does not help her at all; it gives her some sort of ownership and limits any behind-the-scenes denials. She seems at minimum sympathetic; in 2021, she visited the southern border for the first and only time to say , \"This issue cannot be reduced to a political issue. We're talking about children, we're talking about families, we are talking about suffering.\"\n\nIn mid-June, Biden-Harris announced a new amnesty policy lifting the threat of deportation for tens of thousands of illegal aliens married to U.S. citizens. Biden (to be fair, it was in all likelihood almost 100 percent his idea) promoted the new program at a White House event to celebrate the Obama-era \"dreamers\" directive, which offered deportation protections for young illegal immigrants. The new policy allows roughly 490,000 spouses of U.S. citizens an opportunity to apply for a \"parole in place\" program, which would shield them from deportations and offer work permits if they have lived in the country illegally for at least 10 years.\n\nThe new policy also removes a legal barrier to allow qualifying immigrants to apply for permanent residency and eventually, U.S. citizenship. It's a privilege previously reserved solely for spouses of U.S. service members. Those newly-eligible will have three years to apply for citizenship, in time for the 2028 elections if Harris were to get that far.\n\nTo invoke some Obama-love, Biden announced another policy on the 12th anniversary of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA, whose beneficiaries are the famous \"Dreamers\") making recipients of the program eligible for visas, rather than the temporary work authorization they currently receive under the Obama executive order. Getting a visa potentially legalizes the DACAs and sets them up for a shot at permanent residence and then U.S. citizenship. This move could affect as many as 530,110 active DACA holders. This number does not include the pending applications that cannot be processed due to ongoing litigation. As of December 2023, estimates are that the eligible DACA population is 1,161,000 were the program to resume in full under Harris.\n\nOne way to cut back on deportations is to hamstring the parts of the U.S. government involved in uncovering information that could lead to deportation, in this case with unaccompanied minors. The Department of Health and Human Services is no longer inquiring about the criminal histories of migrant teens in its care. A senior HHS official overseeing the program for solo child migrants told the House Judiciary Committee that even though agency officials contact the embassy of whichever country unaccompanied children hail from, they do not request any criminal records.\n\nThey do verify date of birth, the child's birth certificate, and whether the \"child\" is suspected of being an adult. The result is more than 400,000 have been released into the U.S. in the last few years, with 70 percent of that group aged 15 or older and male. This all raises grave concerns about Central and South American gang members taking up residence in the U.S. via this loophole. The gangs once established won't be going away, something a President Harris would have to answer for.\n\nThere's also some small scale-stuff that helps illustrate the whole. One U.S. Customs and Border Protection office in an unnamed airport did not have an effective process for detaining and removing inadmissible travelers. In a two year period, CBP released at least 383 inadmissible travelers from custody; 44 percent of the travelers did not return for their removal flights and disappeared into the United States. Overnight detention requests for inadmissible travelers before removal flights are denied because of staffing and bed space limitations. In addition, CBP does not have enough overtime funds to pay officers to detain inadmissible travelers at the airport after operating hours. CBP also cited difficulties transferring inadmissible travelers to another airport because they must receive permission from the airline involved.\n\nThere's also the so-called \" Dark Brandon \" scenario, where lame-duck Biden, freed from election-related restraints, makes more immigration changes by executive order for Kamala to take responsibility for. Either way, Biden was a terrible president on immigration issues and some Democrat is going to have to pay for it.\n\nBiden (and by extension, Harris) is appealing to a very small part of the base. Over two-thirds of Americans disapprove of his handling of the border. Even Hispanic voters are not swayed by Biden. A recent poll showed a large number of Hispanic people favor the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. illegally. The CBS News/YouGov poll found 53 percent of registered Hispanic voters favor the government starting \"a new national program to deport all undocumented immigrants currently living in the U.S. illegally,\" something already proposed by Donald Trump.\n\nCandidate Harris faces the worst of two worlds. As the sitting vice president, she is expected to support Biden's (unpopular) policies. As a candidate, she must drag those policies forward, and must limit ideas of her own or face calls of disloyalty from the party base. Indeed, a POLITICO article on policy differences between Biden and Harris failed to even mention immigration. Immigration is probably the most significant of those double-edged issues, but other divisive topics, from Ukraine to Gaza, suggest hers will not be an easy road.\n\nPeter Van Buren is the author of We Meant Well: How I Helped Lose the Battle for the Hearts and Minds of the Iraqi People , Hooper's War: A Novel of WWII Japan , and Ghosts of Tom Joad: A Story of the 99 Percent .\n\nThis is not a paywall!\n\nYour support helps us continue our mission of providing thoughtful, independent journalism.

      "text": "Now is time to internationalize the campaign against illegal immigration.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's tremendous start in sealing the U.S. border and deporting illegal migrants can be a springboard for a global initiative to mobilize like-minded world leaders to do the same. Now is the time for the State Department to convoke a worldwide summit of national leaders, officials, organizations, and citizens who are aligned with Trump to coordinate the international fight against illegal immigration.\n\nOn an international stage, Trump could shine a bright light on the funding sources and tactics of an axis of globalist NGOs, international organizations, and left-wing, open-border politicians. For years, this migration \"industry\" has built out networks and support mechanisms that encourage and assist millions of people, confronted with economic privation and corrupt overlords in their homelands, to pick up and flee to the developed world.\n\nThe journeys are mostly clandestine and unauthorized, often dangerous. The migration industry's lawyers, activists, and politicians have cleverly manipulated outdated international legal obligations to pressure First-World countries into accepting this never-ending stream of economic migrants under the guise that they are authentic political refugees and asylum-seekers. Blindly funded by donor governments, the migration industry continues to collect billions perpetuating this endless cycle.\n\nAn international summit, convoked and led by Trump, could be the start of overturning this self-interested and, yes, corrupt migration complex. A Trump summit against illegal migration would assemble like-minded world leaders and send a clarion call that global stability, rule of law, and human safety require countries to maintain strong borders and enforce sensible national security priorities when dealing with dubious refugees, asylum-seekers, and unauthorized migrants.\n\nFor years, the \"international community\" has been the playground of far-left globalists whose leitmotif has been to advocate ever more open-borderism. They have orchestrated countless world-leader powwows and conferences from Brussels to New York, from Washington to Mexico City, all helping to lay the groundwork for today's global migratory chaos. President Trump's summit would dramatically reverse these practices and represent an historic watershed change by demanding new international norms and repudiating open-border orthodoxy.\n\nTrump and other world leaders could start by renouncing the wrongly named \"Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration,\" of 2018, and the United Nations \"New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants,\" all designed to strongarm national governments to open their borders to unauthorized migration. Trump could also use the summit to loudly denounce the so-called \"Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection,\" proclaimed in 2022 by the Biden administration to help unleash migration chaos all across the Americas. Trump's summiteers should denounce politicians in Latin America and elsewhere who have proclaimed the \" right to migrate \" and remind governments around the world of their obligation to take back their deported nationals.\n\nWhile presidential rhetoric is always a valuable tool in shaping world opinion, the Trump global summit should be much more than a symbolic repudiation of far-left globalist declarations and pronouncements. There is also a dire need for concrete action to start specific new processes to reform and replace the legal norms that the migration industry has manipulated so that, in practice, illegal migrants can always claim a \"right\" to stay.\n\nThese practices and legal norms are rooted in the antiquated and flawed 1951 UN Refugee Convention, and its 1967 protocol, along with a host of other international legal instruments. Most governments, particularly those in Europe and the United States, acceded to these international commitments during an era of almost no significant economic migration. The 1951 convention was designed to address dislocated population groups in the aftermath of the Second World War and to help individuals fleeing communist tyranny during the Cold War.\n\nThe world is today dramatically different from the time of the 1951 convention. Because the underlying world facts have changed, the international legal framework must change: clausula rebus sic stantibus , as the long-standing legal doctrine acknowledges. The summit can be the much-needed international political push that launches this long-overdue legal reform.\n\nTo replace the 1951 convention and its related legal instruments, the summit should gather independent subject-matter experts, such as the distinguished migration law scholars in the International Network of Immigration Research ( INIR ), to redesign the entire legal framework, particularly the obligations of countries in dealing with millions of border-jumpers, refugees and asylum-seekers. These independent scholars should be given a mandate and the necessary resources to carry out the will of the summit. If necessary, the selected scholars can continue their deliberations after the summiteers have returned home, and they can report their findings and recommendations in a follow-on world conference.\n\nIt is certain that attempting to reform today's globalist migration industry by working inside the United Nations system is a fool's errand. The UN bureaucratic processes at Turtle Bay would smother any Trump State Department initiative to remake the \"rights of migrants\" legal machinery. A better approach for reform is to bypass the UN system altogether and win over the world of public opinion. The Trump summit strategy would do just that by mobilizing and educating a worldwide movement of leaders, governments, friendly media, and citizens to demand change.\n\nThe summit must also demand that donor states cut off funding to groups like UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the International Organization of Migration (IOM), and powerful NGOs in cahoots with complicit leftwing governments who are dug in to defend the status quo. The amounts of funding that donor governments provide these agents of the global migration industry are much more than most realize. UNHCR alone has over $10 billion in annual funding, and IOM receives over $3.5 billion.\n\nUnder Biden, the State Department's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration (known as PRM ) paid out billions of dollars each year to groups like UNHCR and IOM, which then passed money to illegal migrants for their travel. Immediately after coming to office, Trump's officials at State put a stop to PRM's financing of such unauthorized migration. U.S. taxpayer funds are no longer being funneled to illegal migrants, but other donor nations still pay for clandestine journeys through dangerous regions like the Darien Gap or to cross the Mediterranean Sea. The Trump summit needs to shine a bright light on all of these funding practices around the world. Donor governments must insist their financial contributions, if they are not entirely cut off, be dedicated to deportations or keeping people in their homelands.\n\nOn a global stage, the U.S. president can create a new international dynamic regarding illegal migration. He would not only reinforce policies of like-minded heads of government such as Italy's Giorgia Meloni and Hungary's Viktor Orbán, but he could offer valuable support to other European national leaders, such as Britain's Nigel Farage, France's Marine Le Pen, and Germany's Alice Weidel. Trump's summit strategy would outflank the open-border extremists who dominate the Europe Union in Brussels by reaching out directly to EU member countries such as Austria, Poland, Greece and many other national actors.\n\nFrom other parts of the world, other national governments, not always Washington's allies, but in step with the United States on illegal migration, would certainly attend the summit. This long list would likely include Israel, Turkey, Tunisia, Thailand, Canada, Australia, Chile , Peru, and Ecuador. Many more countries would doubtless respond to Washington's summons for a global summit.\n\nThe moment is both opportune and historic. The next step is for the White House to task the State Department with organizing this unprecedented global gathering, to trumpet Trump's call to friendly world leaders to come together to break the illegal migration industry.\n\nPhillip Linderman is chairman of the Ben Franklin Fellowship and a board member at the Center for Immigration Studies.\n\nThis is not a paywall!\n\nYour support helps us continue our mission of providing thoughtful, independent journalism.

      "text": "Conventional wisdom is turning away from unrestricted immigration. The question is how to put that into policy.\n\nThe American Conservative 's motto, \"Right From the Start,\" betrays a certain polite frustration. The principles and policies that generally cause the nation to flourish-coincidentally the policies that have come to be identified as conservative or right-wing-have been largely unchanged since the McKinley administration.\n\nTake the trade issue. The commonsense approach of Theodore Roosevelt, Warren Harding, and Calvin Coolidge-trade should be facilitated, but strategic industries and the American worker should be protected by moderate tariff regimes-disappeared from the political scene in the latter decades of the last century, with catastrophic strategic and social consequences. Donald Trump brought it back ; now an aggressive trade policy is again the consensus position. Biden's trade representative, Katherine Tai, is holding the Europeans' toes to the fire over steel and aluminum imports. Right from the start indeed.\n\nSimilarly, until quite recently- 1998 is really the year of inflection-fiscal discipline and a balanced budget were considered broadly good things. Then came the disco era of deficit spending: the Global War on Terror, the Bush administration's ambitions to rival Great Society spending on social programs, the easy money Federal Reserve regime, the bailouts and stimulus packages following the 2008 economic crisis, multiple years of quantitative easing, Covid-19 relief. All of a sudden, with a little help from inflation and increasing interest rates, mainstream opinion has rediscovered the virtues of fiscal discipline and a balanced budget. Right from the start again.\n\nThe list goes on. A foreign policy based on restraint and the prioritization of American interests in the Western hemisphere and the two great oceans? Right from the start. A social policy targeted at family formation and the strengthening of local communities? Right from the start. The prevention of cartels and trusts dominating and distorting markets? Right from the start. You get the idea.\n\nIt looks as if we're set for another vindication. A memo must have gone out over the mainstream journalist group chats this week, telling our brave fourth estate that it turns out immigration is a problem. David Leonhardt at the Atlantic :\n\nImmigration tends to impose costs on lower-wage workers and to alter the political atmosphere in ways that make government policy less generous to those same workers. The past century suggests that there are trade-offs between immigration levels and progressive policy goals. Reducing immigration would probably make reducing economic inequality in the United States easier. Lower levels could make Americans more amenable to policies that would benefit immigrants who are already here, such as a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented.\n\nEspecially noteworthy is Leonhardt's observation of the distortions introduced by immigrants abusing chain migration-a topic that Phillip Linderman of the Center for Immigration Studies addressed for TAC at length not a full month ago . Right from-well, do I need to say it again?\n\nA variety of bien-pensants pundits on Twitter also appeared to experiment with immigration skepticism. (One must wonder whether the viral images of Arab immigrants protesting in the U.S. and elsewhere in support of Hamas's ugly war are behind the wavering on this particular liberal piety.) As our own Helen Andrews pointed out, the arguments fielded are ameliorationist and mealy-mouthed . Yet there is a change; this is a far cry from the rhetoric comparing border enforcement to genocide that became so familiar during the last administration. It is worth observing that the pointy-heads are merely catching up with the views held by a majority of Americans, who tend to favor some immigration but regard the current system as a disaster.\n\nThese are not new ideas, but, on the whole, late is probably better than never-although it is very late indeed. The question, of course, is what anyone can do with this fresh gnosis. It appears unlikely that the Republicans, the proper standard-bearers on immigration reform, will be able to get any kind of legislation over the line on their own initiative in the near future; notwithstanding their current episode of internecine warfare, there are reasons to harbor pessimism about the GOP's prospects for 2024, some inherent or structural , some not . That means any movement on immigration will have to happen on a mostly Democratic line-unlikely, given the radicalism of the existing House Democratic caucus-or on a truly bipartisan basis.\n\nThe consensus that has quietly emerged on trade, antitrust regulation, and to some degree on foreign policy is a cause for hope. (Deficit spending and the debt remain elusive.) Set against this is the fact that the House Republicans, as soon as they settle on a leader they can tolerate, are saddled with a politically confounding impeachment , which is liable to sink any cross-aisle overtures. In other words, don't hold your breath.\n\nWe are in a rare moment of clarity, where there is broad sectional agreement on a variety of classic right-wing policies. The trick is enacting those policies. Barring a more favorable political reconfiguration, it looks as if incrementalism and, hateful as it is, bipartisanship will have to carry the day.\n\nJude Russo is the managing editor of The American Conservative and a contributing editor of The New York Sun .

      "text": "American immigration history offers lessons for those tasked with implementing Trump's ambitious crackdown.\n\nFor much of America's history, the idea of deporting people, never mind mass deportations, was unheard of. Prior to the end of the 19th century or so, America barely had any immigration laws at all; people just sort of showed up to help fill a young, hungry, and scrappy nation in desperate need of workers and farmers. Prohibitive immigration laws did not appear until around the time of the First World War, when a growing population coupled with growing elements of racism combined to shut the door a bit.\n\nThe arrival of the Great Depression in 1929 led to the first \"mass deportations.\" The 1931 La Placita sweep in Los Angeles was the first major public immigration raid, and one of the largest in a wave of \"repatriation drives\" that rolled across the country during the Great Depression. La Placita Square was a prominent public space which had become a hub for the Mexican community, where many migrants gathered.\n\nSome 400 Mexican farm workers found there one day, legal or not, were deemed \"illegal aliens,\" and became scapegoats for job shortages and shrinking public benefits. President Herbert Hoover's slogan, \"American Jobs for Real Americans,\" kicked off local legislation banning employment of anyone of Mexican descent. Police descended on workplaces, parks, and social clubs, dumping people willy-nilly across the border via trains and buses. Some two million \"Mexicans,\" including an estimated half of whom were actually U.S. citizens, were deported without due process.\n\nUnder President Dwight Eisenhower, mass immigration deportations were carried out through a campaign known formally as Operation Wetback, which aimed to address illegal immigration, particularly from Mexico. This initiative took place between 1954 and 1955, followed by the end of the Bracero Program ten years later, and was one of the most significant efforts to date in U.S. history to deport undocumented immigrants, with a focus on those who had entered the country without permission or overstayed their visas.\n\nAs in the country's earliest days, it was labor shortages that drove immigration, in this case the absence of so many young American men from the economy as they went off to fight the Second World War. As the war gave way to post-war prosperity and the baby boom, the continued influx of Mexicans seeking better economic opportunities in the U.S. shifted from a welcome thing to unfair competition with returning soldiers for jobs.\n\nThe demand for cheap labor remained high, but by the early 1950s there were increasing concerns about the number of undocumented workers in the U.S. The Eisenhower administration, in the context of the broader Cold War climate, saw the issue as both an economic and national security concern, i.e., control of the border. A secondary issue was the Bracero Program (1942-1964), which allowed temporary guest workers from Mexico to work legally in the U.S.. While the program, too, was meant to fill labor gaps during wartime, it became a point of contention as many workers, once they had completed their contract, stayed in the U.S. illegally.\n\nOperation Wetback launched in June 1954 and was a collaborative effort between the Immigration and Naturalization Service (today, ICE), the U.S. Border Patrol, and local law enforcement. The goal was to round up and deport undocumented Mexican immigrants. The operation was initially focused on regions like Texas and California, which had high concentrations of undocumented workers. However, it quickly expanded to other parts of the U.S. with significant Mexican populations. Approximately one million people were deported or voluntarily returned to Mexico during the operation. Many of those deported had been in the U.S. for years. Civil rights organizations protested the operation for its heavy-handed approach, its racial profiling, and its violation of due process for those detained and deported.\n\nFor Trump's plans to deport some subset of the estimated 13 million illegals in the U.S. to have any success at all, his program will need to pick out the elements of the earlier efforts which worked, and stay away from their missteps-that \"learn from history\" stuff.\n\nOn the plus side, the use of local law enforcement, or at least their passive cooperation, is essential. As in the past, the proposed scale of deportations and complexity of the process (the term \"mass deportations\" is a misnomer, as each deportee in 2025 is entitled to a judicial process before removal) very quickly outruns the resources of ICE.\n\nInstead, ICE will need to work with local law enforcement to ID potential deportees, house them until their court dates, and then transfer them to ICE custody as applicable. Some 65 percent of current deportations take place through this sort of cooperation, moving out of the country persons already in local custody for some crime. It'll work well in states like Oklahoma and Texas who have already promised robust joint efforts, and work poorly in New York and California where efforts will be somewhere between a complete lack of cooperation to outright hostility to the idea. Mass raids or sweeps as in the past are a non-starter in 2025, both for public relations purposes and because it is wholly inefficient (though don't discount a few \"show\" raids, especially at first-political theater is not dead).\n\nThe other key take-aways from earlier large-scale deportations are to avoid detaining American citizens, and in the same vein, decide what to do with the American citizens who are children of illegals.\n\nA quick test on the former point-using only what is in your wallet or purse, prove you are an American citizen. For the average American, a driver's license is not proof of American citizenship. A driver's license is primarily issued as a state-level identification to allow individuals to operate a motor vehicle legally and buy alcohol and tobacco. It is not a document that directly verifies a person's citizenship status.\n\nTo prove U.S. citizenship, you typically need to present one of the following documents rarely carried: a U.S. passport (or a passport card), a state-issued U.S. birth certificate, a certificate of naturalization (for naturalized citizens), or a certificate of citizenship (rare.) While a driver's license may indicate an individual is legally residing in the U.S., it does not provide definitive proof of citizenship. Also some states, like California, issue driver's licenses to undocumented immigrants. Absent the rare individual who carries one of the aforementioned documents around casually, most detainees will need to be run through various ICE and State Department databases to prove or disprove citizenship. That alone argues against the value/efficiency of raids and sweeps and in favor of focusing deportation efforts on already-arrested individuals whose incarceration has provided time to run the necessary checks. Trump's deportation process must be meticulous in avoiding American citizen adults.\n\nLastly there is the problem of those American citizen children, kids almost always being citizens simply by virtue of their birth in America (\"birthright citizenship\"). Tom Homan, Trump's incoming border czar, plans on offering only two options to illegal parents with American citizen kids: take the kids with you back to the parents' home country, or leave them with someone in the U.S. to grow up here as is their legal right. The former demands Trump's deportation work be carried out quickly, to avoid another rough round of \"Kids in Cages\" and all the negative publicity. Trump has suggested some sort of carve-out from deportation for DACA kids.\n\nThere's little evidence to suggest the mass deportation efforts of the 1930s and 1950s were successful at curbing illegal immigration. The number of undocumented immigrants has in fact tripled just since the 1990s. But like claiming the death penalty has no value because murders continue to occur, overlooking the value of large-scale deportations is foolish. In the aftermath of the Biden administration's open border policy, something must be done to restore balance in the immigration system. And getting rid of illegal immigrant criminals is a good thing. Trump's broader plan, even if it never reaches anywhere near 13 million deported (J.D. Vance suggests one million a year is a more realistic number), is the needed beginning of a more comprehensive solution.\n\nPeter Van Buren is the author of We Meant Well: How I Helped Lose the Battle for the Hearts and Minds of the Iraqi People , Hooper's War: A Novel of WWII Japan , and Ghosts of Tom Joad: A Story of the 99 Percent .\n\nThis is not a paywall!\n\nYour support helps us continue our mission of providing thoughtful, independent journalism.

      "text": "What seems impossible today will be routine tomorrow.\n\nThe American foreign policy establishment, a.k.a. the Blob, is like the drunk who is looking under a streetlight for his car keys. He knows he did not drop them there, but it is where he can see. In identifying threats to America and its vital interests, the Blob can only see those that arise on an east-west axis, i.e., China and Russia. But the mortal danger to the U.S., Europe and most of the rest of the northern hemisphere flows from the Global South. To that danger the Blob is blind.\n\nWhat is that danger? Mass immigration from places with dysfunctional cultures. Despite the \"multicultural\" baloney, only two cultures have proven successful over time, Western and Chinese. That is why Chinese immigrants quickly become successful middle-class citizens in Western countries. People pouring over Europe's and America's southern borders come from places where nothing works. The cause of their failure is, at root, cultural. Climate change, shifts in world trade patterns, socialist governments that destroy the local economy, etc., are all factors. But functional cultures can deal with these problems. South American, African, and Islamic cultures cannot.\n\nSo their people flee, seeking a place where things do work. But they take the culture they are fleeing with them, because it is all they know. Wherever they settle in large numbers, crime, dishonest dealing, disregard for civic duties, and general decline follow. What was our country slowly becomes theirs.\n\nThe Blob cannot perceive any of this, partly because of their cultural Marxism, partly because they only recognize threats from other states, and mostly because an east-west orientation on threats from Russia and China keeps the money flowing. Defending borders does not demand trillion-dollar fighter planes (like the flying piano that is the F-35). It does not offer cushy jobs to foreign service bureaucrats. It does not generate useless conferences where think tank \"experts\" can justify their existence to their donors. So the political establishments here and in Europe leave the pet door open and millions of skunks invade our living rooms.\n\nThe Blob's east-west fixation represents the highest level of foreign policy error, a false orientation at the grand strategic level. We have seen the consequences of such error before, in 1914. The three Christian, conservative monarchies of Russia, Germany, and Austria-Hungary all focused on each other as the prime threat. The real threat was secular democracy. Had they united against it, they might still be with us today. Instead, they destroyed each other, and the victors were America's worst ever president, Woodrow Wilson, and a guy named Lenin sitting in a cafe in Zurich. That is the scale of catastrophe a false orientation at the grand strategic level can bring.\n\nAs Lenin asked, what is to be done? An answer is rising in Europe: re-immigration. While both Europe and the U.S. face massive invasions by immigrants, their problems are not identical. Most of those swimming the Rio Grande are Christian. Those from Venezuela were in many cases members of the middle class until socialism destroyed their country's economy. They are coming faster than we can acculturate them, but with time and sharp restriction of the flow rate most can become Americans.\n\nThe Moslems pouring across the Mediterranean into Europe are a wholly different matter. They will never acculturate. Their religion forbids it. When in Britain parading Moslems carry banners saying \"Islam: Our Religion Today, Your Religion Tomorrow,\" they are not suggesting Britons will have a choice in the matter.\n\nEuropean conservatives are proposing the only answer that can preserve European civilization: re-immigration. Re-immigration means sending them back.\n\nHere is how it might work. As soon as an illegal alien lands on a European shore, he or she is put aboard a ship. Containerships with bare-bones living accommodations made from shipping containers can hold many people. When the ship or ships are full, they carry the would-be invaders back to a non-European shore. Ideally, it would be the shore from which they sailed for Europe, and the country there would willingly receive them. If it won't, European navies suddenly have a mission. They make an amphibious landing, dump the illegals ashore, and leave. The message would soon become clear; if you make it to Europe, your stay will be measured in hours. In the face of that reality, the flow across the Mediterranean would dry up.\n\nIs Europe capable of this? Physically, yes. Politically, not yet. But Europe's real right is rising, and invasion from the global south is putting wind in their sails. What seems impossible today will be routine tomorrow.\n\nThis article appears in the November/December 2023 issue\n\nWilliam S.

      "text": "Trump's proposal has obvious flaws, but can be a first draft for a better system.\n\nIn a move that is self-defeating and exposes the fundamental problem with America's immigration system, Donald Trump proposed \"automatically\" giving green cards to foreign nationals who graduate from a U.S. college.\n\nA Trump spokesperson clarified the offer to include both two-year and junior colleges, and to include every foreign student except those who are \"communists, radical Islamists, Hamas supporters, America haters, and public charges.\" Trump said this was another \"Day One\" plan for him. The goal is \"to keep the most skilled graduates who can make significant contributions to America.\" Currently foreign national college grads have to either leave the U.S. after graduation, work for two years as \" practical trainees \" and then depart, or apply for a hard-to-get work visa or change of status.\n\nThe plan, of course, is self-defeating on its face. Trump, like most people who read it, thinks his plan will scoop up the Red Chinese MIT PhD with the 4.0 GPA who wants to work on AI for Nvidia-forgetting America's college system includes pay-for-play schools and visa mills, aimed directly at foreigners who just want a student visa to allow them to work in the U.S. at whatever job. Trump also forgets perhaps his own college days, which must have included a kid who just barely got by and graduated with a C- average in Medieval Music Theory. Not much demand for that. Once again, in order to get the baby, America is drinking the bathwater, too.\n\nThe concept of a merit-based system in the U.S. is not new. As president, Trump flirted with the idea but never moved to implement it. Even Hillary Clinton proposed a plan to link college grads to green cards. Since 1965, the American immigration system has been tied to the concept of family unification, with little interest paid to anything merit-based. The core problem with the family reunification system is the primary qualification to immigrate legally is simply that family tie. So America gets the drunk brother alongside the nuclear physicist sister. It's a crapshoot. There is no connection to America's economic needs. Things work similarly at the border, where America gets whoever survives the Darwinian slog through Mexico.\n\nThe American family unification system, with its small number of merit-based visas tagging along (mostly in the H-1B category) is near unique in the industrialized world. Britain, Canada, Australia , and New Zealand primarily use a merit system based on \"points.\" Based on national needs, an applicant with no relatives in Canada will accrue points based on education (Canada awards 135 points for a master's and only 30 for a high school diploma), language ability (extra points if you are fluent in English and French), and job skills. But you may not need a masters in computer technology for Canada; they'll also take you if you are a tar sands miner willing to live five years in the unsettled west. The key is tying merit-based points to the nation's economic needs.\n\nThe U.S. is stingy with the merit-based visas it does offer. Out of a total legal immigrant pool of about one million, the annual cap for the 2023 fiscal year was 65,000 skilled worker visas, plus only an additional 20,000 visas for foreign professionals with a master's degree or doctorate from a U.S. institution. Not all H-1B visas, however, are subject to this cap. For example, up to 6,800 visas are set aside each year for the H-1B program under U.S.-Chile and U.S.-Singapore free trade agreements. Something special about skilled people in Chile compared to, say, Columbia?\n\nThrough the 19th century, America had virtually no restrictions on immigration. The country was huge and unsettled, and the need for unskilled workers was vast. Waves of Germans, Irish, Jews, and Italians came from every dump across Europe and beyond for work. New York City, the largest port of entry, was a center of light manufacturing and the source of more than half of the nation's ready-made clothing; the vast Midwest was full of farms and steel plants.\n\nThe first real restrictions targeted the Chinese after they were no longer needed to build the western railways. Following the First World War, Italians and eastern European Jews, \"inferior\" groups, were banned. Racism dovetailed with an economy that was shrinking (ultimately drastically, in the Great Depression) and demanding higher-skill workers.\n\nThe years following the Second World War saw a massive change in immigration law. It was believed there was room for everyone again amid the postwar boom; old racial wrongs were righted by removing national quotas and emphasizing family unification. In a change from earlier immigration waves, most post-war immigrants were the relatives of earlier immigrants. The education and skills they had and how they met the needs of the American economy were not seriously considered. This system persists.\n\nBut what if we can do better, a lot better, for the needs of the 21st century?\n\nThe monetary reasons are there-what Trump is aiming for. Immigrants and their children founded nearly half of the Fortune 500 companies. These include five of the top 12: Nvidia, founded by a Taiwan national with a master's from Stanford; Apple; founded by the son of a Syrian, no degree; Google, co-founded by a Russian immigrant, also with an MA from Stanford; Amazon, founded by the son of a Cuban immigrant with a degree from Princeton; and Costco, founded by the son of Canadian immigrants (San Diego City College) whose family emigrated from Romania. These companies alone posted a combined revenue of $1.4 trillion in fiscal year 2023, more than the gross domestic product of many nations. And immigrants are about 80 percent more likely to start a company than U.S.-born citizens.\n\nAnd that's not to say someone else, in this instance the UK, hasn't already tried the idea and fouled it up by being too generous. Britain has a scheme which allows most college grads to stay on for two years and work toward residency.\n\nThe UK Graduate Route allows graduates to stay and work in the UK for up to two years after finalizing their studies. The government estimates this visa attracted many migrants to the UK, with them often misusing their benefits. More than 40 percent of people coming to the country for employment purposes in 2023 came from India or Nigeria. Talks for new rules follow plans to ban British universities from accepting certain postgraduates, in an effort to reduce net migration in the UK, which is highly driven by international students.\n\nSo there are lessons learned out there. Meanwhile, let's not make the same mistake with college grads we made with relatives of earlier immigrants; this time let us separate the baby from the bathwater and get rid of the less valuable part. Instead of handing out green cards willy-nilly with each diploma, subject grads to a merit-based system with points awarded to skills/majors in demand, accredited schools that rank well nationally, high GPAs, as well as English ability and proven entrepreneurial skills. Trump is close to right in singling out foreign-born college grads. We need only to tweak the system he proposes to pick out the very best America deserves.\n\nPeter Van Buren is the author of We Meant Well: How I Helped Lose the Battle for the Hearts and Minds of the Iraqi People , Hooper's War: A Novel of WWII Japan , and Ghosts of Tom Joad: A Story of the 99 Percent .\n\nThis is not a paywall!\n\nYour support helps us continue our mission of providing thoughtful, independent journalism.

      "text": "GOP lawmakers back bill to lock illegal aliens out of path to citizenship\n\nThe measure aims to deter unlawful entries.\n\nHouse Republicans are backing a bill that would prevent illegal aliens from seeking a pathway to citizenship.\n\nRep. Cory Mills (R-Fla.) introduced the No Citizenship for Alien Invaders Act on Thursday, which would \"prohibit immigrants, of any nationality, who have illegally entered the United States from ever obtaining legal citizenship.\"\n\n'There can be NO citizenship for the nearly 20 MILLION people who live here illegally.'\n\nIf passed, Mills' bill would amend the existing Immigration and Nationality Act to state , \"No alien who enters the United States unlawfully shall be eligible for naturalization, notwithstanding any other provision of the immigration laws.\"\n\nMills said, \"Under the Biden administration, we saw more than 10 million encounters at our borders, a crisis exacerbated by reckless catch-and-release policies that allowed criminals who broke our laws to remain in the United States.\"\n\n\"President Trump has made it clear that anyone that tries to unlawfully undermine, exploit, or bypass our immigration system is a criminal,\" he continued. \"The No Citizenship for Alien Invaders Act will ensure these criminals will never be granted U.S. citizenship; that privilege will be reserved for those who respect our laws.\"\n\nThe proposed legislation already has several co-sponsors, including Republican Reps. Josh Brecheen (Okla.), Andy Harris (Md.), and Anna Paulina Luna (Fla.).\n\nBrecheen explained that the bill would prevent illegal immigrants from \"being rewarded with citizenship after breaking our laws.\"\n\n\"America is a nation of laws, and if we allow those laws to be subverted by illegal aliens who have no constitutional right to be here in the first place, then we will cease to be a nation,\" he said. \"It's time we get back to common-sense policies that restore law and order to America.\"\n\nLuna stated , \"Time and time again, Congress refuses to enforce our immigration laws, complains about it being broken, promises to 'fix it for good' in exchange for amnesty programs, and then never actually enforces the law like they promised.\"\n\n\"We need to draw a line in the sand for the sake of the American people: There can be NO citizenship for the nearly 20 MILLION people who live here illegally,\" she added.\n\nEarlier this week, Mills also introduced the Prohibiting Automatic Rights to Enter National Territory Act, which would close birthright citizenship loopholes.\n\nThis bill would also amend the INA, adding language that would ensure that only those born to at least one parent who is a U.S. citizen or lawful permanent resident would receive birthright citizenship.\n\nMills noted that the proposed legislation adds to President Donald Trump's executive order that similarly sought to close birthright citizenship loopholes.\n\n\"For decades, criminal migrants have exploited loopholes in our immigration system, undermining our nation's sovereignty, straining taxpayer resources, and ignoring the rule of law,\" Mills said. \"By amending the Immigration and Nationality Act, the PARENT Act seeks to end the abuse and reaffirm the principles of American citizenship and our constitutional republic.\"\n\n\"Building on President Trump's efforts to protect American sovereignty, this bill ensures birthright citizenship is reserved for those with a legal right to be here. It's past time to restore integrity to our laws and put American citizens first,\" he added.\n\nHarris also co-sponsored Mills' PARENT Act.\n\nLike Blaze News?

      "text": "Trump just empowered states to fight back against illegal immigration\n\nCritics have labeled the president's 'invasion' rhetoric as xenophobic, overlooking its policy basis.\n\nDonald Trump has wasted no time making his mark in his return to the White House.\n\nIn less than a week, the president has signed dozens of new executive orders and repealed nearly 80 orders and memorandums from the Biden era.\n\nIf the federal government declares an invasion has occurred, then states have the right and arguably the duty to respond accordingly.\n\nOne of the most notable orders, titled \" Guaranteeing the States Protection Against Invasion ,\" introduced immediate changes to immigration law.\n\nThe order suspends temporarily a contentious policy that allows immigrants to enter the United States by claiming asylum.\n\nAdditionally, it directs federal agents to block entry for immigrants who fail to provide sufficient medical information or reliable criminal and background records.\n\nPerhaps the most important change, however, is one that has received little attention from the media - the classification of the ongoing border crisis as an \"invasion.\"\n\nMany of Trump's critics have classified the \"invasion\" rhetoric as xenophobic or racist, but in doing so, they have completely missed an important policy justification for using the term. By calling what's occurring at the southern border an \"invasion,\" Trump has effectively given states the right to take drastic action against illegal immigration.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that the Constitution prioritizes federal authority over state authority in immigration matters.\n\nThe court has determined that Article II grants the president the power to regulate many aspects of foreign affairs, including issues connected to immigration.\n\nArticle I empowers Congress to \"establish a uniform Rule of Naturalization,\" governing the process of becoming a citizen.\n\nThe Constitution provides little mention of states' rights regarding immigration, a lack often interpreted as justification for federal control of the issue.\n\nHowever, in Article I, Section 10 , the Constitution declares, \"No State shall, without the Consent of Congress, ... engage in War, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.\"\n\nIn other words, although states cannot determine citizenship or set a foreign affairs agenda that's out of step with the president, they can defend themselves from an invasion.\n\nDuring the Biden administration, officials reported more than 8 million illegal border \"encounters,\" a figure that captures the number of people caught by officials while trying to illegally enter the United States. Importantly, data on \"encounters\" do not reflect the potentially millions of other immigrants who have come to America illegally over the same period but weren't caught.\n\nSome states have argued that this wave of illegal immigration constitutes an \"invasion\" and that because the Constitution allows states to combat an invasion, state officials should have the right to take action.\n\nFor example, in 2023, Texas lawmakers claimed the state had been invaded and then passed Senate Bill 4 , which, among other things, gave Texas police the power to arrest illegal immigrants.\n\nThe law has been tied up in court since it was passed, largely because of courts' reluctance to give states power over immigration and because claims of an \"invasion\" depend on the Constitution's meaning of the term, which has been in dispute for years among legal scholars.\n\nNow that the Trump administration has officially declared that the recent immigration crisis is an \"invasion,\" there should be no doubt that states have the legal authority to defend themselves. This would be a significant enhancement of states' rights, assuming the designation and subsequent actions on the part of states survive legal challenges.\n\nRegardless of your position on immigration, we should all be able to agree that states ought to have the power to defend themselves in the event of an invasion. And if the federal government declares an invasion has occurred, then states have the right and arguably the duty to respond accordingly.\n\nIf you disagree, then who, exactly, should have the right to decide when an \"invasion\" has occurred?\n\nAlthough opponents of the new order won't want to hear it, elections do, indeed, have consequences.\n\nJustin Haskins"

      "text": "Clock ticks for Trump's immigration crackdown\n\nThe new president's immigration promises face renewed urgency as America grapples with domestic terror risks and growing cultural subversion.\n\nOn December 7, 2015, during the Iowa caucus campaign, Donald Trump announced his plan for \"a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.\" Nearly a decade later, the argument for such a shutdown has intensified. Pro-Hamas demonstrations among Islamic immigrants highlight concerns, and Trump's presidency could represent the final opportunity to fulfill his pledge and prevent what some view as an impending European-style influence by Sharia-adherent invaders. The question remains: Is Trump up to the task?\n\nSeven months before Trump's statement, I wrote a column warning that Islamic immigration had doubled since 9/11 and was the fastest-growing subset of America's already substantial annual intake. Between 2001 and 2013, the U.S. issued 1,628,854 green cards to immigrants from 43 predominantly Muslim countries.\n\nWith greater political capital and clearer legal precedent, Trump has an opportunity to expand his ban.\n\nNow, nearly a decade later and nine years into Trump's leadership of the Republican Party, the numbers tell a sobering story. From 2014 to 2023, the U.S. granted 1,453,940 green cards to the same 43 countries, averaging 145,395 per year - higher than the 125,000 annual average of the previous decade. This increase would be even greater if not for COVID-19, which slowed immigration for over two years. In 2023 alone, about 170,000 immigrants arrived from these countries, excluding at least 100,000 foreign students from the same regions.\n\nSince 9/11, the United States has issued roughly three million green cards to nationals of predominantly Islamic countries, along with several million non-immigrant visas. This figure does not account for the significant number of illegal immigrants from these countries, particularly since Joe Biden took office.\n\nIn comparison, England's total Muslim population stands at about 3.8 million, yet the country has experienced widespread challenges from incorrigible Islamic subversion. While the United States' larger size makes assimilation challenges relatively less troublesome, the sheer numbers remain critical when assessing the potential for radicalization and domestic terrorism threats.\n\nShouldn't we prioritize assimilating those already here and addressing the growing problem of homegrown radicalization before expanding immigration from nations plagued by Islamic supremacism?\n\nWith a history of Islamic terror attacks on American soil and increasing cultural subversion marked by anti-Jewish hatred and pro-Hamas sentiment, why hasn't the Trump administration acted with greater urgency to halt immigration? The Trump v. Hawaii decision affirms Trump's clear authority under Section 212(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act to restrict immigration categories in the national interest. The lack of decisive action is difficult to reconcile with these pressing concerns.\n\nDuring Trump's first term, an October 2017 order banned visas from countries including Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mali, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen, as well as North Korea and South Sudan. The ban on Iraq was later lifted, and restrictions on other countries were limited to specific visa categories or shorter durations. Combined with lower court injunctions and Biden's subsequent election, these policies had little impact on the overall flow of radical Islamists into the United States.\n\nNow, with greater political capital and clearer legal precedent, Trump has an opportunity to expand this ban. The focus should extend beyond countries lacking \"vetting\" tools or diplomatic cooperation to include any nation with a significant presence of Islamic terrorism and anti-American sentiment. The growing size of pro-terrorist rallies in the U.S. underscores this urgency - these demonstrations grow because the number of immigrants admitted from such countries increases each year.\n\nTrump's use of Section 212(f) immigration authority will serve as an early indicator of his presidency's direction. Cutting spending and addressing complex domestic issues may lack immediate momentum, and deportations require significant resources to reverse Biden's immigration surge. However, restricting further immigration from these countries, allowing time to assimilate record numbers already here, is a step Trump can take swiftly and with settled legal precedent.\n\nIf not now, when? The clock is ticking.\n\nDaniel Horowitz\n\nBlaze Podcast Host"

      "text": "Trump backs TRUE immigration reform with RAISE Act\n\nFor far too long, much as with health care reform, the Washington Cartel has hijacked the meaning of immigration reform. Until now, it has meant mass amnesty for illegal immigration, endless expansion of the current failed legal immigration system, and ignoring the needs of the American citizen.\n\nSens. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and David Perdue, R-Ga., with the re-introduction of the RAISE (Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy) Act , have flipped the paradigm on its head. Most importantly, the White House is actually taking an active role in promoting this legislation - an imperative in promoting any conservative idea.\n\nThere is broad consensus among the public that immigration should a) be limited to those who have unique skills; b) cultivate the assimilation of American values and the English language; and c) that it should be a net positive for all Americans, not just the corporate-D.C. cartel.\n\nThis is the message Trump ran on, and it is the message that Cotton and Purdue have restored with this legislation (after a several-month detour by the White House ). If the president continues to use the bully pulpit to sell this plan, he could go a long way toward staving off a looming disaster in the midterms and actually making the party stand for something important again.\n\nThe problem: The 1965 immigration bill\n\nAs I chronicle in detail of Chapter 7 of my book, \" Stolen Sovereignty ,\" the 1965 immigration bill killed our immigration system long before illegal immigration and the 1986 amnesty became the dominant issues.\n\nThe Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 was sold by its proponents as the exact opposite of what it has actually done. It was sold as in line with our history and tradition of only bringing in those who will patriotically assimilate and not become a drain on the public purse.\n\nSen. Ted Kennedy, the lead sponsor of the bill, famously declared , \"The bill will not flood our cities with immigrants. It will not upset the ethnic mix of our society. It will not relax the standards of admission. It will not cause American workers to lose their jobs.\" He thundered at a Senate hearing how \"the bill will not permit the entry of subversive persons, criminals, illiterates, or those with contagious disease or serious mental illness\" or \"to a person who is likely to become a public charge.\"\n\nSensing what the public wanted from immigration, the LBJ administration echoed a similar sentiment. Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach predicted that the '65 bill would induce a net increase of only about 60,000 immigrants per year.\n\nA complete lie. The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 wound up being the most extreme policy implemented during the latter part of the 20 th century, as measured against the criteria laid down by the bill's own supporters. Here are some points from my book:\n\nAs leading immigration historian Aristide Zolberg has observed, \"Whether hailed or deplored, there is no gainsaying that this development was contrary to the tacit agreement to maintain immigration as a minor feature of American existence that underlay the 1965 reform.\"\n\nThe new RAISE Act: What would it do?\n\nThe main problem of the 1965 bill, which was exacerbated by a 1990 immigration bill, is that it forced immigration officials to prioritize family ties over skills.\n\nThus, once the initial burst of immigrants was predominantly low-skilled and from third-world countries, it set off a phenomenon of \"chain migration,\" whereby the majority of future immigrants were from similar socio-economic backgrounds.\n\nThe result is that just 15 percent of our green cards (1.6 million of the 10.8 million legal permanent residents over the past decade) are allocated based on any skill, and most of those green cards are not awarded for broad-based skills and ability to assimilate - but rather in crony visa programs.\n\nWhich brings us back to the RAISE Act. This bill fulfills the blueprint I laid out in \"Stolen Sovereignty\" for cutting immigration by 40-50 percent by merely getting rid of the non-skilled, extended-family categories. By getting rid of the diversity visa lottery and extended-family visa preferences, this bill charts a path toward re-empowering Americans to determine who gets to join the civil society.\n\nDeeply rooted in the preamble of the Declaration and in consent-based governance is that the citizenry must decide every important policy issue. And the most important decision is the future orientation of the society. Converting our system to a skills-based criterion rather than a family-based one will place the keys of our immigration system back in the hands of the citizenry rather than special interests and the immigrants themselves. It will end the stolen sovereignty.\n\nOn the employment side of the ledger, rather than submit the future of our society to individual corporations that lobby the most for visas, this bill would revamp the current visa system and replace it with 130,000 visas to be allocated based on a points system that prioritizes education, English-language proficiency, high-paying job offers, merit, and entrepreneurial initiative. Those with the most points will get first preference.\n\nThis system would completely cut out the cronyism and is the sort of holistic reform of immigration that many of us want for health care . When you appeal to broad common-sense principles and cut out the crony middlemen, the American people are empowered and much of the politics goes by the wayside.\n\nOn paper, even Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio , and an array of Democrats have said they want a system that is based on merit rather than family ties. Now is their time to back up their words. Do they really care about the immigration issue beyond the obsession with amnesty?\n\nThankfully, President Trump is leading on this issue and actually endorsing a good piece of legislation. He should deliver a special address before Congress laying out the vision and unite the party behind it. A united GOP (one could only dream!) behind this issue would open up an entirely new front in the 2018 midterms.\n\nIt's time we stop ceding the ground of common-sense reform to those who seek to perpetuate the failed status quo.\n\nEditor's note: This article has been updated to correct a typographical error.\n\nFind out what the mainstream media won't tell you about President Trump and his administration.\n\nSign up to get CRTV's free White House Brief delivered right to your inbox once a day.\n\nDaniel Horowitz\n\nBlaze Podcast Host"

      "text": "Immigration: 'Where Tenderness Leads to the Gas Chamber\n\nMy title here is a famous quote from Flannery O'Connor. What exactly did she mean by saying \"Tenderness leads to the gas chamber\"?\n\nWas she citing the Nazis' kindness to animals (Adolf Hitler was an anti-hunting vegetarian)? Or was she thinking of Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger, whose stories of overburdened poor mothers made the case for sterilizing them ?\n\nJust like Sanger, too many Americans in 2014 want to feel like really good, compassionate, people - without paying the price. We want cheap grace, easy miracles, and automatic progress.\n\nAnd that explains why we don't secure our country's borders.\n\nWe want people to like us. To think that we're \"nice.\" We want to feel nice, and to experience nice things - like comfort, safety, leisure, and that warm fuzzy feeling that comes from taking easy moral stances that get us applauded by our peers. We don't want to brush up against real poverty or injustice, even if that is the price of fixing them.\n\n[sharequote align=\"center\"]We don't want to brush up against poverty or injustice, even if that is the price of fixing them[/sharequote]\n\nThis lust for the nice explains why so many otherwise sensible Christians have gotten drunk with their own sheer goodness and \"openness\" on the subject of immigration.\n\nHere are the facts: Americans have voted for certain immigration laws, which have been widely disregarded for many years. The Americans who benefited most were employers who use cheap labor, whose workers get hurt building houses, then get dropped off at the public emergency ward.\n\nThe citizens who suffered were embattled blue collar workers, honest business owners who pay fair wages to legal workers, and ordinary law-abiding taxpayers.\n\nThe amnesty granted in 1986 to a few million immigrants was supposed to march in lockstep with strict enforcement of workplace verification - but the cheap labor lobby protested, and President Ronald Reagan backed down. The result was a law that offered amnesty, but did nothing to prevent the ongoing exploitation of workers in the shadow economy, or create order on our borders.\n\nBoys await medical appointments in a holding area where hundreds of mostly Central American immigrant children are being processed and held at the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Nogales Placement Center on Wednesday, June 18, 2014, in Nogales, Ariz. (AP/Ross D. Franklin, Pool)\n\nWhat we need today is a rational, statesmanlike compromise, which combines a hardcore seriousness about enforcing our laws with some measure of mercy toward millions of people who already live among us. But that compromise has failed.\n\nA year ago, many Americans would have been willing to support a \"path to citizenship\" - provided it was accompanied by real, honest, comprehensive efforts to make sure that another such amnesty would never be needed again. I angered many of my own conservative friends in 2012 by advocating a \"path to citizenship,\" conditioned on rock-solid enforcement of our labor laws and serious border security.\n\nBut liberal Democrats hungry for votes and cynical Republicans in hock to low-paying employers combined to kill such a compromise. Every measure for really guaranteeing our borders was stripped out or watered down, rendering the \"path to citizenship\" a lure to future migrants in the underground economy, just like the 1986 bill that so flagrantly failed - and attracted 11 million more people to join the ranks of the exploited.\n\nWhat is worse, far worse, is the ripple effect that talk of \"amnesty\" without enforcement has had throughout our poorer neighbors. As Fox News reports :\n\nNewspapers, TV shows, and social media throughout Latin America are reporting the very same thing - effectively running ads for the ruthless \"coyotes\" (human traffickers) who promise to deliver children safely to America. In England, the Daily Mail has published appalling pictures of the victims of immigrant smugglers, who are getting rich on the rumor of an impending U.S. amnesty.\n\nResidents of border states will tell you about the \" rape trees ,\" full of panties torn from trafficked women who were brutalized and dumped in the desert. Even without the cartel-connected, heavily armed coyotes, travel through the desert can be deadly - as Gilberto Ramos learned.\n\nAs the Washington Post reports, that 15-year-old boy left Guatemala to come to America in search of work that could fund his mother's treatment for epilepsy. He wore a white plastic rosary she gave him - which Gilberto was still wearing when authorities found his desiccated body.\n\nGilberto died so that Americans could feel good about themselves.\n\nWe want to be seen as the kind of people who selflessly \"welcome the stranger.\" We want to eat quesadillas and wield a few phrases in butchered Spanish, and sneer at the \"xenophobes\" who tell us about the rape trees. We want to enjoy the low, low prices made possible by cheap, unprotected labor - and we don't want to hear about the price that other people will pay.\n\nTrue grace, actual empathy, and genuine compassion are not fleeting emotions that flicker through our heads and stir our hearts, like a glimpse of porn. Instead they are firmly rooted in reality, in the truth. And the truth is that without political order, without the firm enforcement of democratic laws, what reigns instead is chaos. And chaos is the natural habitat for the human traffickers, rapists, drug smugglers and other exploiters of the helpless. Until we as a nation make the hard choices needed to impose a just order on the influx of immigrants, we are all responsible for the suffering that results.\n\nA human rights activist and filmmaker, Jason Scott Jones is co-author of the upcoming \" The Race to Save Our Century: Five Core Principles to Promote Peace, Freedom, and a Culture of Life. \"\n\n-\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.

Our government is the government of zero action with zero accountability,\" said McGregor.\n\n\"Our money is being spent on overseas issues that has nothing to do with the Irish people. The illegal immigration racket is running ravage on the country. There are rural towns in Ireland that have been overrun in one swoop, that have become a minority in one swoop.\"\n\nHe went on to say that he wanted to inform 40 million Irish-Americans about the existential threat of illegal immigration to their homeland.\n\nMcGregor has suggested that he might run for president of Ireland in 2025, though the position is largely ceremonial.\n\nHis comments and visit were condemned by the political leaders of Ireland, including Irish Prime Minister Micheal Martin.\n\n\"St. Patrick's Day around the world is a day rooted in community, humanity, friendship and fellowship. Conor McGregor's remarks are wrong, and do not reflect the spirit of St. Patrick's Day, or the views of the people of Ireland,\" wrote Martin on social media.\n\n\"I'm here in New York City where I've seen so much that is great about Irish-America. Conor McGregor is not in the US representing Ireland, he doesn't speak for Ireland, or its people,\" responded Deputy Prime Minister Simon Harris.\n\nOthers criticized the choice because McGregor had been accused of rape and lost a civil court case against his accuser. He was ordered to pay her £200,000, the equivalent of about $260,000. He denied the allegations and said the interaction was consensual.\n\nMcGregor had previously excoriated Trump for saying that his favorite UFC fighter was Khabib Nurmagomedov, a Russian fighter who had been one of McGregor's most fierce competitors.\n\n\"We couldn't think of a better guest to have with us on St. Patrick's Day,\" said Leavitt.\n\nLike Blaze News?

      "text": "Supreme Court Immigration Case Validates Nomination Fight\n\nIt was another close call at the U.S. Supreme Court. A 4-4 tie gave us the right outcome in US v. Texas , the case that challenged President Obama's executive overreach on immigration.\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - MARCH 16: US President Barack Obama (L), nominates Judge Merrick B. Garland (R), to the US Supreme Court, in the Rose Garden at the White House, March 16, 2016 in Washington, DC. Garland currently serves as the chief judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, and if confirmed by the US Senate, would replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia. (Photo: Mark Wilson/Getty Images)\n\nTwenty-six states had filed suit to block the president's executive order. District Judge Andrew Hanen issued an injunction blocking implementation of the order, concluding that the president was trying to enact through executive action something that violated existing law. The president was, once again (as he so often has been), reminded that there are constitutional boundaries to his role as president. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the injunction.\n\nNow the Supreme Court has also affirmed the lower court's opinion rebuking the president for appropriating the legislative role by bypassing Congress to enact new legislation by fiat.\n\nThat's the issue in this case. Not immigration.\n\nWe must get this right. Whatever your personal position on the immigration debate, this case has nothing to do with it. What the court rightly protected here are the structures of government that guard our liberties. They only answer who gets to decide on this issue that is so important to our nation. The answer is that the president cannot act alone, as dictators do.\n\nWe must think clearly and rightly on this. Obama continues to try to bully the country into supporting his legislative agenda. This is not the way our constitutional republic is set up to work. In America, anyone wanting to support a particular policy has every opportunity to convince his fellow Americans and bring about, through the legislative process, the policies they seek.\n\nThis is hard work, no doubt. It is meant to be that way, so that the process itself will ensure only the best policies make their way through. But the president refuses to do the hard work necessary to persuade policy makers and bring about the changes he seeks. It is not that he has tried and failed. He has not even tried. Instead, the president usually gives a speech asking for something, and if he doesn't get it, he goes ahead and does what he wants anyway, bypassing Congress (and therefore the people) hoping activist judges will uphold his unconstitutional actions.\n\nBut the courts are supposed to block the president in such instances. When one branch of government oversteps its constitutional role, it is the duty of the other branches to push back.\n\nThis is why the Republican leadership is correct in making the proper role of Supreme Court Justices an issue in the upcoming elections by withholding consent from President Obama's nominee to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia, Judge Merrick Garland.\n\nIt is fairly clear the president would have had his way if Garland would have been sitting on the Court today. That would have been catastrophic for our country. Truly.\n\nAgain, not because of immigration, but because of the breakdown in the separation of powers established by the Constitution. Our immigration policy is a legitimate issue that must be addressed by Congress hearing the voice of its constituents and coming up with the best solutions to address their concerns. But if a president can just enact and repeal legislation as he pleases, we all lose.\n\nEven proponents of immigration will lose when all of a sudden a president comes along to undo by another unconstitutional executive action, something contrary to what Obama has done.\n\nWe need judges with an unflinching commitment to the Constitution, not ones who make decisions based on their personal policy preferences.\n\nWe have seen the damage cases like Dred Scott v. Sandford , Roe v. Wade and Obergefell v. Hodges have done. It is time for us to move away from this model that is destroying our nation from within.\n\nWhen we preserve our constitutional structures, regardless of policy outcomes, we protect freedom and liberty for all.\n\nMario Diaz, Esq. is Legal Counsel at Concerned Women for America, the nation's largest public policy women's organization.

Then, only if their application is denied there would they be allowed to seek asylum here.\n\nPresident Trump made the major announcement as part of his attempt to crackdown on the crush of migrants coming to the southern border. Department of Homeland Security Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan said, \"Ultimately, today's action will reduce the overwhelming burdens on our domestic system caused by asylum-seekers failing to seek urgent protection in the first available country, economic migrants lacking a legitimate fear of persecution, and the transnational criminal organizations, traffickers, and smugglers exploiting our system for profits.\" The president's motives for moves likes this one are constantly criticized by his opponents. But he addressed concerns about his approach to immigration reform with CBN News aboard Air Force One back in October of last year.\n\nCBN's Chief Political Analyst David Brody asked him, \"Critics who say, look, you are just doing this for political reasons to gin up the base, what's the answer to that?\"\n\nTrump replied, \"Well if I am I've been doing it for a long time, I've been on this issue for a long time ever since you've known me and now we have a chance to do something about it. The problem is we need Democrat votes, we have no Democrat votes.\" Democrats pushed back on this latest move to curb immigration, with 2020 presidential candidate Beto O'Rourke calling the new policy \"inhumane\". Attorney General William Barr argues that's not true, adding that the US is a \"generous country but is being completely overwhelmed.\" Immigration courts are backlogged by more than 800,000 cases. In 2018, there were 162,060 claims filed and 13,169 were granted.\n\nThe asylum rule does apply to children who crossed the border alone. But the new policy does include exceptions - for example, victims of human trafficking.\n\nThe rule is set to take effect Tuesday, but the ACLU is vowing a legal challenge. Meanwhile, migrant communities are bracing in the US after talk of a major deportation of illegal immigrants. ICE is expected to target roughly 2,000 people in 10 cities this week.\n\nBELOW: As Trump Admin Launches New Asylum Policy, World Relief Takes a Closer Look\n\nShare This article\n\nBen Kennedy is an Emmy Award-winning White House correspondent for CBN News in Washington, D.C.

      "text": "From Border Surge to Expedited Afghan Refugees, Ex-Homeland Security Chief Warns: 'It Only Takes One'\n\nShare This article\n\nFor two consecutive months this summer, U.S. Border Patrol agents apprehended more than 200,000 people trying to enter the country illegally. Then, in September, the Biden administration's push to remove 15,000 Haitian refugees from the Texas town of Del Rio sparked a fresh crisis. Now, a new warning is emerging over another significant surge of migrants in Central and South America heading north.\n\nThousands of Haitian migrants who once gathered under the bridge in Del Rio, Texas are now in the United States . And another massive wave, as many as 400,000, may be coming to the border.\n\nAppearing on the CBN News program \"The Global Lane\", former U.S. Acting Secretary Homeland Security Chad Wolf explained why.\n\n\"They're incentivized because of the success of those Haitians in Del Rio getting across and now into American communities. So, I think it is the Biden administration's job right now to break up those caravans and they need to do that by working with Mexican officials and others, but they also need to do that by, not only the messaging but the policies that they put in place.\"\n\nAn appeals court recently ruled the Biden administration can continue deporting migrant families trying to cross the U.S-Mexico border under a COVID-19 pandemic rule. Known as Title 42, the Trump administration issued the order in March 2020 to slow the spread of the virus coming into the country.\n\nWolf says with tens of thousands more on the way, the U.S. Border Patrol will have insufficient personnel to process the migrants. That's partly because the federal vaccine mandate may cause many agents to lose their jobs if they don't get vaccinated.\n\n\"The Biden administration certainly has a double standard here that doesn't make a lot of sense to most Americans. You have law enforcement officers who are dealing with these migrants and coming into contact with these migrants every day. The migrants have a choice on whether or not to take the vaccine, but the Border Patrol and the law enforcement don't,\" Wolf said.\n\nMeanwhile, meth and fentanyl seizures at the border have increased dramatically this year. So, how concerned is he about gangs trafficking drugs and even humans?\n\n\"When you have 15,000 folks under that bridge in Del Rio, it takes an immense amount of Border Patrol time and attention to care for and to process those individuals, and that's time that you don't have Border Patrol on the line, on that international border making sure that you're not only keeping migrants out, but you're keeping illegal narcotics and other contraband out. And so when you have something like Del Rio, it just sucks up all the resources,\" he said.\n\nImmigration concerns go well beyond the southern border. Many Afghan refugees brought to the U.S. are being vetted after they arrive, rather than beforehand. And at least 700 reportedly have left their housing at U.S. military bases without completing their processing.\n\nWolf said, \"We're doing it when they are already here in the country versus doing it overseas in a safe third country so, I've got some real concerns about the manner and the speed in which they are trying to do these background checks. The system is not designed to do it in the manner in which they want it to be done.

Given the city has a population of 1.2million, however, the effects of international migration aren't as stark as they are in Middlesbrough.\n\nOnly South Holland and the Isles of Scilly saw a higher number of international emigrants than immigrants, according to MailOnline's analysis of 318 districts in England and Wales.\n\nThis figure reflects people immigrating from outside of the UK.\n\nMovement around the UK - known as internal migration - is recorded separately.\n\nThe ONS cautions there might be some overlap in the data, although it is unclear by how much because of the difficulties in examining population flow.\n\nFor example, the same person could be classed as both an international immigrant and internal emigrant. They could also die, further confusing the picture.\n\nGovernment statistics yesterday revealed 728,000 more people were added to the UK's population in the year ending June 2024.\n\nThat figure was almost as high as the previous record, set in the previous 12-month spell.\n\nBut the bar was shifted upwards because of the ONS's revision to the 740,000 estimate it originally published.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nThe ONS said it now has more complete data and has also improved how it estimates the migration behaviour of people arriving in the UK from outside the EU.\n\nIt estimated that fewer EU nationals departed the country, and more students from outside the EU stayed after finishing courses.\n\nHowever, the latest revisions will fuel criticism of the statistical body, which is already under intense fire for faulty labour force numbers.\n\nThe scale of the inflows - with the peak roughly equivalent to adding two cities the same size as Leicester in a year - is poised to spark a fresh political row.\n\nNumbers from outside the EU have exploded since 2021, after the Brexit deal took effect.\n\nOf the 1.2million people who came to live in the UK in the 12 months to June 2024, around 86 per cent - a million - hailed from outside the EU.\n\nIndian was the most common nationality for both work-related (116,000) and study-related (127,000) reasons.\n\nKemi Badenoch used a major speech last night to insist the Tories would not allow Britain to be treated like a 'hotel' for migrants.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nShe warned yesterday that immigration levels are 'a world away from where we need to be' as she promised a 'strict numerical cap' on arrivals. Only those able to make a 'substantial and clear contribution' to Britain will be allowed in, the Tory leader said.\n\nMs Badenoch will review Britain's membership of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the continuation of Labour's Human Rights Act, which have both been blamed for blocking past attempts to get tough.\n\nThe Tory leader said there would be 'zero tolerance for foreign criminals remaining in the UK'.\n\nFollowing their landslide election win, Labour immediately vowed to tackle the small boats crisis with its Border Security Command to counter trafficking gangs and people smugglers.\n\nEx-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak 's plan to send migrants to Rwanda was canned, however.\n\nMiddlesbrough has witnessed its population grow from 138,368 in 2011 to north of 150,000 in 2023.\n\nLast year the total of new foreign migrants arriving in the town was 4.44 per cent of the total population, analysis suggested.\n\nMeanwhile, 480 housing units were started in the last financial year, while 600 were completed.\n\nThe local NHS trust treats 61.6 per cent of patients within the 18-week NHS England target.\n\nHalf of all patients in the area are treated within 14 weeks, while 92/100 patients wait 43 weeks for a consultation with a consultant.\n\nSome 97 per cent of primary school children and 83 per cent of secondary students receive their first choice option.\n\nMiddlesbrough has reported the highest percentage of new arrivals to the UK over the past year compared with their population\n\nIn Leicester, data suggests 3.6 per cent of the total population are immigrants who arrived in the area over the past financial year.\n\nThe population of the city has grown by more than 13 per cent between 2011 and 2023, rising from 329,627 to 379,780.\n\nThe city has seen 110 new homes started with a further 260 properties completed over the past 12 months.\n\nThe local NHS trust manages to see 59.4 per cent of patients within the 18-week NHS England guideline.\n\nHalf of all patients referred to a consultant receive their first appointment within 15 works, while 97 per cent of primary and 81 per cent of secondary pupils receive their first choice school.\n\nLeicester has reported that more than 3.5 per cent of their population has arrived in the UK over the past year\n\nIn Coventry, the population has increased from 316,915 to 360,702 between 2011 and 2023, a rise of 12 per cent.\n\nLast year the number of new migrants to the city made up a total of 4.31 per cent of the population, MailOnline's calculations implied.\n\nOver the past financial year, 690 new homes were started while a further 730 were completed in the city.\n\nSome 54.2 per cent of patients being referred to a consultant at the local NHS trust receive their first appointment within 18 weeks.\n\nIn schools, 94.5 per cent of primary and 81.8 per cent of secondary school pupils received their first choice.\n\nLast year the number of new migrants to Coventry made up a total of 4.31 per cent of the population\n\nIn Camden, the population of the borough has only increased by 0.37 per cent since 2011.\n\nData suggests that 3.48 per cent of the population have arrived from overseas in the past year.\n\nThe borough has seen 70 new homes started and 70 completed over the past financial year, while 59 per cent of NHS patients in the area receive their initial consultant-led treatment within 18 weeks.\n\nHalf of all patients receive that consultation within 15 weeks, while 92 out of 100 were seen within 46 weeks.\n\nIn schools, only 84 per cent of primary school students and 76 per cent of secondary school pupils received their first choice.\n\nIn Camden, 3.48 per cent of the population have arrived from overseas in the past year\n\nIn Newham, the population has increased by more than 14 per cent between 2011 and 2023, jumping from 310,460 to 362,552 over that period.\n\nIn the past 12 months, 3.94 per cent of the borough's population is thought to have arrived from abroad, however, with 2,080 new houses started and 1,480 completed, they had the largest number of developments of the five areas.\n\nAlmost 55 per cent of patients referred for hospital treatment at the local trust are seen within the 18-week target.\n\nMeanwhile, 92 per cent of primary school pupils and 69.5 per cent of secondary school students receive their first choice options.\n\nIn the past 12 months, 3.94 per cent of the London Borough of Newham's population has arrived from abroad\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

      "text": "Anthony Albanese promised to slash Australia's ballooning immigration - but another 432,150 migrants have still arrived in the last year alone\n\nBy STEPHEN JOHNSON, ECONOMICS REPORTER FOR DAILY MAIL AUSTRALIA\n\nPublished: 23:44 EDT, 11 September 2024 | Updated: 03:34 EDT, 12 September 2024\n\n173\n\nView comments\n\nAnthony Albanese 's promise to slash immigration in half is looking shallow with the big overseas influx continuing.\n\nIn the year to July, 432,150 migrants on a net basis moved to Australia.\n\nThis was despite the May Budget forecasting a fall in net overseas migration to 260,000 by the end of this financial year, 2024-25, compared with 528,000 in 2022-23.\n\nInstitute of Public Affairs deputy executive director Daniel Wild said the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics data exposed how immigration was still growing at unsustainably high levels.\n\n'The federal government has repeatedly promised to cut migration levels yet, month after month, migration intake records continue to be exceeded,' he said.\n\n'It is clear the Prime Minister has no intention to rein in the unsustainable migration intake.'\n\nThe influx of international students in particular has created a rental crisis in cities, with tenants braving long queues and suffering from housing stress.\n\nInternational students make up a big share of Australia's permanent and long-term intake. Education Minister Jason Clare last month announced a 270,000 cap on foreigners coming here to study in 2025.\n\nAnthony Albanese's promise to slash immigration in half is looking shallow with the big overseas influx continuing\n\nHe argued this cap was a key to reducing overall immigration, as promised in the Budget.\n\n'What it does, in first instance, is help us to meet that net overseas migration number,' he said on Wednesday.\n\n'Our universities don't run the migration system in Australia, a government should.'\n\nAustralia's permanent intake, covering skilled migrants, is being capped at 185,000 in 2024-25 which means the government will only achieve its goal of reducing overall immigration levels if there is a big exodus of international students once they graduate.\n\nRecord-high immigration levels have failed to arrest Australia's falling productivity levels .\n\nAustralia has also been in a per capita recession since the March quarter of 2023 where economic output for every Australian has been flat or shrinking .\n\nThe massive population increase has failed to significantly boost economic activity in the face of the Reserve Bank's 13 interest rate rises in 2022 and 2023.\n\nAustralia's economy grew by just 1 per cent in 2023-24, marking the slowest annual growth since 1991 outside of a pandemic , as population pressures added to the cost-of-living crisis.\n\n'Australia's out-of-control migration intake is unsustainable and making Australians poorer,' Mr Wild said.\n\nThe rapid population increase has also been linked to the rental crisis in the capital cities, which have an ultra-tight vacancy rate of 1.3 per cent.\n\n'Australians have had a gutful of being treated like mugs by the federal government when it comes to its never-ending, unplanned mass migration program,' Mr Wild said.\n\n'This policy failure is causing immense economic and social pressure amid a housing and cost-of-living crisis.'\n\nThe big influx of international students has led to a rental crisis in the capital cities, with tenants braving long queues and suffering from housing cost stress (pictured is a Bondi open home inspection)\n\nIn the year to July, 165,443 new homes were approved.\n\nThis was well short of Labor's 240,000 annual target as part of its plan to build 1.2million homes over the five years to June 2029.\n\nWith 2.5 people on average per household, the latest building approvals tally meant Australia would still have a shortage of 18,542 homes to cater for the new migrants, once those houses and units were built.\n\nThe ABS won't have updated building activity data on completed homes, for the June quarter, until October 9.\n\nBut in the year to March, 171,667 homes were completed.\n\nBuilding approval numbers are much lower than they were in 2022, and soaring construction costs have seen a long list of construction companies go bust; making up a quarter of all insolvencies.\n\nReserve Bank Governor Michele Bullock has also ruled out any rate cut in 2024 with the headline inflation rate of 3.8 per cent still well above the RBA's 2 to 3 per cent target.\n\nInstitute of Public Affairs deputy executive director Daniel Wild said high immigration was making Australia poorer\n\n'The out-of-control migration intake is one of the largest social and economic failures in Australia's history,' Mr Wild said.\n\n'It is totally unplanned for, and has fuelled a perfect storm of high inflation, declining household incomes, and record and rising house prices and rents.'\n\nThe evidence linking high immigration with the property market is mixed.\n\nSimon Pressley, the managing director of buyer's agency group Propertyology, said local economic performance was a bigger driver of house prices than overseas migration.\n\n'Most overseas migrants don't buy a property within the first seven years of moving here - they rent,' he told Daily Mail Australia.\n\n'So, when someone rents that doesn't affect the value of the asset, it affects the price that they are paying for rent.\n\n'The existing resident population: they are the ones who have the biggest influence on housing demand because people don't stay put all the time.'\n\nSydney's median house price rose by 5.7 per cent in the year to August to $1.471million , CoreLogic data showed.\n\nBut Melbourne, another city with a high overseas migration intake, saw its mid-point house price fall by 1.1 per cent to $929,715 after Victoria's Labor government introduced a flat $975 annual investor tax .\n\nThe cities with the biggest house price surges are getting a bigger influx of interstate migration, with Brisbane's median house price rising by 14.1 per cent over the year to $966,382 as Perth values soared 24.3 per cent to $818,839.\n\nDaily Mail Australia contacted Mr Albanese's office for comment.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Her father believed that in doing so she had essentially broken the terms of her tourist visa waiver, which bans vacationers from doing work while in the US.\n\nLast week it emerged that a French space researcher - who has not yet been named - was subject to a random airport search on his way to a conference in Houston, Texas .\n\nOfficers found messages 'which conveyed a hatred toward Trump and could be considered to be terrorism', according to AFP, while another source suggested they felt the messages were 'hateful and conspiracy'.\n\nPhilippe Baptiste, France 's minister of higher education and research, condemned the US authorities for taking action over a 'personal opinion'.\n\nThe FBI later informed the academic that they had opened an investigation into the matter, but the agency later dropped charges.\n\nAfter being rejected on March 9, he was sent back to Europe the following day, with authorities confiscating his personal and professional equipment.\n\nIn a statement to Le Monde , Baptiste said: 'I learned with concern that a French researcher who was traveling to a conference near Houston was denied entry to the United States before being expelled.\n\n'This measure was apparently taken by the American authorities because the researcher's phone contained exchanges with colleagues and friends in which he expressed a personal opinion on the Trump administration's research policy.'\n\nHomeland Security Department spokeswoman Tricia Mclaughlin told the New York Times that this was not the case, claiming instead that the scientist had confidential information on his electronic device from Los Alamos National Laboratory, which he had taken without permission and tried to conceal.\n\n'The Trump administration is enforcing immigration laws - something the previous administration failed to do,' Ms McLaughlin said of the recent arrests.\n\n'Those who violate these laws will be processed, detained and removed as required.'\n\nWhile US customs officials are allowed to stop and search all people attempting to enter the country, customs agents are not allowed to search people or conduct inspections 'based on your religion, race, national origin, gender, ethnicity or political beliefs'.\n\nThe French researcher is just the latest tourist to face deportation back to their home country.\n\nGerman tattoo artist Jessica Brösche, 26, says she was left in solitary confinement with over a week after being arrested while trying to legally cross the US-Mexico border\n\nGerman tourist Jessica Brösche, 26, faced a similar ordeal she tried to walk through a checkpoint at the southern border.\n\nThe tattoo artist was arrested by border agents when she tried to cross from Tijuana into San Diego on January 25.\n\nBrösche was traveling with her American friend Nikita Lofving as a tourist under the ESTA visa waiver program. The two had met in Tijuana and were carrying tattooing equipment .\n\nImmigration officials reportedly accused Brösche of working in the US the last time she entered the country with the ESTA program, an electronic system that determines whether someone is eligible to enter the US without a visa.\n\nLofving told the outlet she asked officials if Brösche could be sent back to Mexico, but they said she would be deported to Germany in three to five days because she could not offer proof of residence in the Latin American country.\n\nBut Brösche says she spent days in a cell at the San Diego border before she was taken into ICE custody and brought to the the Otay Mesa Detention Center, where she has been held for more than a month.\n\n'I just want to get home, you know? I'm really desperate,' she told ABC 10. Her detainment included a 'horrible' eight days in solitary confinement, she added.\n\nBerlin has said it is investigating and has involved its consulate in Boston to assist one of the individuals still affected.\n\nAmerican Pie actress Jasmine Mooney was also detained by ICE for nearly two weeks\n\n'The final decision on whether a person can enter the US lies with the U.S. border authorities,' a spokesperson for Germany's Foreign Office said.\n\nGermany's travel advisory warns that false information, past criminal records, or even minor overstays on previous trips could lead to arrest, deportation, or detention - with no legal recourse.\n\nCanadian actress Jasmine Mooney was also detained by ICE, in her case for nearly two weeks .\n\nThe 35-year-old had been denied entry into the US while trying to make her way from Mexico to San Diego, California after her work visa was revoked back in November while traveling from Vancouver to Los Angeles .\n\nThe American Pie: The Book of Love star landed back on Canadian soil on Saturday as her mother, Alexis Eagles, and friends met her at Vancouver International Airport around midnight.\n\nAccording to her mother, who's been fighting for her daughter's return home, Mooney was detained at the San Ysidro border crossing before being transferred to San Luis Regional Detention Center in Arizona .\n\nShe was loaded into a prisoner van, she said, and 'put in chains' by border officials. 'That's when I realized they are onboarding me into a real prison,' she said.\n\nWhile she was there, Mooney said she endured some of the harshest treatment there that left her weak and confused.\n\nAfter being arrested and taken to the detention center, Mooney was featured in an emotional interview with ABC10, where she sobbed describing the conditions she and other women faced.\n\n'I've never seen anything like this,' she told the outlet. 'I feel like we have been kidnapped, and we are in some sort of insane social, psychological, social experiment.'\n\nWelling up, Mooney added: 'I really want to be a voice for the women in here, because what is happening is so unjust and I know that there's a better way to do this.'\n\nShe also noted how her time in custody made her severely confused.\n\n'It's been 11 days now, and I have no idea what is going on, they don't tell you anything, and I have lost so much weight. I'm truly, physically, weak.'\n\nThe rise in tourists being detained was green-lighted by President Trump as part of his 'Securing Our Borders' executive order signed in hours after the inauguration .\n\nHilton Beckham, Assistant Commissioner of Public Affairs for the US Customs and Border Protection, told MailOnline: 'If individuals violate the terms of a lawful immigration status and attempt to re-enter the country, officers will take appropriate action. Federal privacy restrictions prohibit CBP from discussing specific cases.\n\n'All persons arriving at a port of entry to the United States are subject to inspection on a case-by-case basis. As part of their critical national security mission, CBP officers routinely determine admissibility of foreign nationals using longstanding U.S. immigration law.\n\n'If an individual has material discovered on their electronic media that raises flags during an inspection, it can result in further analysis. Claims that such decisions are politically motivated are completely unfounded.'\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

LEPORE FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 22:17 EDT, 10 March 2025 | Updated: 08:29 EDT, 13 March 2025\n\n995\n\nView comments\n\nDonald Trump's border czar Tom Homan said that Mahmoud Khalil could be the first of many green cards holders to be deported amid his widespread crackdown on legal and illegal immigrants.\n\nPresident Trump boasted about the arrest of Khalil earlier Monday, warning it was 'the first of many to come' - even though Khalil is a legal resident who has not been convicted of a crime.\n\nKhalil - a Palestinian who was born and raised in Syria - helped to lead protests against Israel at Columbia University last year. He also acted as a negotiator between students and university officials.\n\nA judge has since stepped in to temporarily block the deportation of the 27-year-old pro-Palestine activist, pending a further ruling on the matter .\n\nHoman, who has led Trump's agenda on the border at full force, said that 'absolutely we can' deport green card holders such as Khalil.\n\n'Did he violate the terms of his visa? Did he violate the terms of his residency here, you know, committing crimes, attacking Israeli students, locking down buildings, destroying property? Absolutely,' he told Fox Business.\n\nHowever, Khalil has yet to be convicted of a crime , which complicates Homan's assertion that he violated his visas terms.\n\nNevertheless, Homan reiterated that Khalil could be just the first of many visa holders sent packing.\n\n'Any resident alien who commits a crime is eligible for deportation,' he said of anti-Israel protesters on American campuses . 'And that's just one out of many.'\n\nDonald Trump's border czar Tom Homan said that Mahmoud Khalil could be the first of many immigrants who may be deported despite having green cards\n\nPresident Trump boasted about the arrest of Khalil earlier Monday, warning likeminded activists it was 'the first of many to come' as he embarks on his mass deportation policy\n\nKhalil was detained by ICE officers on Saturday night - who said they'd been given an order to revoke his green card - in front of his pregnant wife.\n\nBut a federal judge Jesse Furman, from the Southern District of New York, poured cold water on Trump's plan on Monday.\n\nFurman blocked the administration from deporting Khalil until at least the next court hearing on Wednesday.\n\nThe court order, seen by DailyMail.com, states: 'To preserve the Court's jurisdiction pending a ruling on the petition, Petitioner shall not be removed from the United States unless and until the Court orders otherwise.'\n\nFurman was nominated to the Southern District court by President Obama in 2011 and was confirmed in February 2012.\n\nThe protests at Columbia were allowed to run rampant for two weeks. They were marked by violent assaults and instances of Jewish students being afraid to go to class .\n\n'On March 9, 2025, in support of President Trump's executive orders prohibiting anti-Semitism, and in coordination with the Department of State, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested Mahmoud Khalil, a former Columbia University graduate student,' the Department of Homeland Security said Sunday.\n\n'Khalil led activities aligned to Hamas, a designated terrorist organization,'\n\nTrump said the ICE agents who arrested Khalil did so with pride, describing him as 'a Radical Foreign Pro-Hamas Student on the campus of Columbia University.\n\nMahmoud Khalil, who was the lead student negotiator for the pro-Palestinian encampment, was arrested by Department of Homeland Security agents on Saturday night is currently being held\n\n'We know there are more students at Columbia and other Universities across the Country who have engaged in pro-terrorist, anti-Semitic, anti-American activity , and the Trump Administration will not tolerate it.\n\n'Many are not students, they are paid agitators. We will find, apprehend, and deport these terrorist sympathizers from our country - never to return again.\n\n'If you support terrorism, including the slaughtering of innocent men, women, and children, your presence is contrary to our national and foreign policy interests, and you are not welcome here.'\n\nIn a direct warning to universities and colleges across the nation, Trump said they are expected to 'comply' with this decision.\n\nKhalil, who graduated in December, is in custody at an immigration detention facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey , according to federal records.\n\nActivists who are lobbying for Khalil's release say he was confronted at 8:30pm in his apartment building by two plain clothes DHS agents, both of whom refused to identify themselves at first.\n\nHis wife, who is eight months pregnant and a US citizen, was allegedly there as well. The activists said she was threatened with arrest if she 'remained by his side.'\n\nIn the United States, immigration judges are the only people with the authority to revoke permanent residency.\n\nHoman, who has led Trump's agenda on the border at full force, said that 'absolutely we can' deport green card holders such as Khalil\n\nA handout picture released by Guatemalan Migration Institute shows Guatemalan migrants descending from an US military plane after being deported from America\n\nGrounds for revocation include lying on your green card application or committing certain types of felonies.\n\nAccording to a legal filing, 'ICE began efforts to transfer Mr. Khalil out of [New York] and to a Louisiana detention facility a thousand miles away, without providing him any access to his counsel.'\n\n'This seemingly retaliatory action is particularly troubling,' the filing states.\n\nKhalil's arrest comes as Trump announced he would be cutting $400 million in grants and contracts to Columbia for its failure to contain the pro-Palestinian protests.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

The decision has already been challenged in federal courts.\n\nTo more rigorously scrutinize immigrants applying for citizenship status, green cards and asylum, administration officials have also announced plans to review their social media accounts.\n\nAccording to a presidential proclamation cited by officials, Trump instructed federal agencies to 'vet and screen to the maximum degree possible all aliens who intend to be admitted, enter, or are already inside the United States'\n\nThe increased restrictions on immigration applications come as countries have begun issuing travel warnings for the US after Customs and Border Patrol have detained a number of tourists\n\nUSCIS said assessing social media accounts is required for 'the enhanced identity verification, vetting and national security screening,' CBS reported.\n\nWhile the review process of an applicant's social media is not a new procedure, under new scrutiny applicants would be required to submit their social media accounts, or handles, to the government for review.\n\nThe increased restrictions on immigration applications come as countries have begun issuing travel warnings for the US after Customs and Border Patrol have detained a number of tourists.\n\nUS border officials have been using more aggressive methods with holidaymakers and legal immigrations, with the administrations 'enhanced vetting.'\n\nBritain's foreign office issued revised advice for UK citizens travelling to the US to include a warning that anyone found breaking its rules 'may be liable to arrest or detention.'\n\nAfter a French scientist was denied entry after officials discovered 'hateful' messages criticizing the president on his phone, suspicion has led many to believe those expressing anti-Trump views may be more likely to be turned away.\n\nThe suspicions come as a British artist Becky Burke, 28, was handcuffed and detained in Washington after being classed as an 'illegal alien .'\n\nBurke had attempted to cross the border into Canada with an 'incorrect visa' on February 26, US authorities said.\n\nHomeland Security Department spokeswoman Tricia Mclaughlin told the New York Times: 'The Trump administration is enforcing immigration laws - something the previous administration failed to do. Those who violate these laws will be processed, detained and removed as required'\n\nBecky Burke, 28, was handcuffed and taken to a detention cell in Tacoma, Washington, on February 26 and is now back in the UK\n\nLast week, a French space researcher was subject to a random airport search on his way to a conference in Houston.\n\nMessages 'which conveyed a hatred toward Trump and could be considered terrorism' were found on the researcher's phone.\n\nThe French minister of higher education and research, Phillippe Baptiste, condemned US authorities for taking action over a 'personal opinion.'\n\nThe FBI later informed the academic that they had opened an investigation into the matter, but the agency later dropped charges.\n\nAfter being rejected on March 9, he was sent back to Europe the following day, with authorities confiscating his personal and professional equipment.\n\nHomeland Security Department spokeswoman Tricia Mclaughlin told the New York Times: 'The Trump administration is enforcing immigration laws - something the previous administration failed to do. Those who violate these laws will be processed, detained and removed as required.'\n\nWhile US customs officials are allowed to stop and search all people attempting to enter the country, customs agents are not allowed to search people or conduct inspections 'based on your religion, race, national origin, gender, ethnicity or political beliefs'.\n\nCanadian actress Jasmine Mooney was also detained by ICE, in her case for nearly two weeks.\n\nAmerican Pie actress Jasmine Mooney was also detained by ICE for nearly two weeks\n\nThe 35-year-old had been denied entry into the US while trying to make her way from Mexico to San Diego, California after her work visa was revoked back in November while traveling from Vancouver to Los Angeles.\n\nThe American Pie: The Book of Love star landed back on Canadian soil on Saturday as her mother, Alexis Eagles, and friends met her at Vancouver International Airport around midnight.\n\nAccording to her mother, who's been fighting for her daughter's return home, Mooney was detained at the San Ysidro border crossing before being transferred to San Luis Regional Detention Center in Arizona.\n\nShe was loaded into a prisoner van, she said, and 'put in chains' by border officials. 'That's when I realized they are onboarding me into a real prison,' she said.\n\nWhile she was there, Mooney said she endured some of the harshest treatment there that left her weak and confused.\n\nAfter being arrested and taken to the detention center, Mooney was featured in an emotional interview with ABC10, where she sobbed describing the conditions she and other women faced.\n\n'I've never seen anything like this,' she told the outlet. 'I feel like we have been kidnapped, and we are in some sort of insane social, psychological, social experiment.'\n\nTearing up, Mooney added: 'I really want to be a voice for the women in here, because what is happening is so unjust and I know that there's a better way to do this.'\n\nShe also noted how her time in custody made her severely confused.\n\n'It's been 11 days now, and I have no idea what is going on, they don't tell you anything, and I have lost so much weight. I'm truly, physically, weak.'\n\nThe rise in tourists being detained was green-lighted by Trump as part of his 'Securing Our Borders' executive order signed in hours after the inauguration.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Federal privacy restrictions prohibit CBP from discussing specific cases.\n\n'All persons arriving at a port of entry to the United States are subject to inspection on a case-by-case basis. As part of their critical national security mission, CBP officers routinely determine admissibility of foreign nationals using longstanding U.S. immigration law.\n\n'If an individual has material discovered on their electronic media that raises flags during an inspection, it can result in further analysis. Claims that such decisions are politically motivated are completely unfounded.'\n\nYesterday it emerged that another academic, Badar Khan Suri - an Indian national studying and teaching on a student visa at Georgetown University - was detained by immigration authorities.\n\nThe postdoctoral fellow was arrested outside his home in Virginia on Monday night, and was told by agents that the government had revoked his visa, according to Politico .\n\nOfficials reportedly used the same provision of immigration law as they did with Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University graduate student and green card holder who led pro-Palestinian protests on campus.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has pledged to stop the 'invasion' of illegal migrants\n\nLegal experts have warned that the Trump administration has likely exceeded its authority in invoking rarely applied laws as part of its immigration crackdown.\n\nThe 18th-century Alien Enemies Act, which gives the president the authority to detain and deport foreign citizens during times of war, has been used to deport 238 alleged gang members.\n\nImmigration lawyer David Leopold told Reuters : 'This broad immigration statute, based solely on some abstract foreign policy worry, is being used to chill speech.'\n\nA number of European nationals have also either been denied entry or detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in recent weeks.\n\nBecky Burke, 28, only returned to Wales this week after being held at a processing centre for 19 days due to a visa mix-up at the US-Canada border.\n\nThe artist was detained in Washington after initially being denied entry by Canadian authorities and then told to return to the US.\n\nHer father Paul Burke told the BBC that it 'will take some time for Becky to recover from this traumatic experience'.\n\nMeanwhile, German authorities were forced to tighten up travel advice after three German nationals were held in a detention facility for weeks.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

      "text": "Britain is 'stagnating because of its immigration', JD Vance says\n\nBy TARYN PEDLER\n\nPublished: 21:45 EDT, 18 March 2025 | Updated: 21:50 EDT, 18 March 2025\n\n2.9k\n\nView comments\n\nBritain is being stifled by soaring levels of immigration, US Vice President JD Vance has claimed.\n\nIn a blistering speech on Tuesday, Mr Vance accused Western nations of growing 'lazy' by relying on 'cheap labour' instead of driving productivity.\n\nAddressing a room of tech bosses in Washington DC , he said: 'I'd say that if you look in nearly every country, from Canada to the UK, that imported large amounts of cheap labour, you've seen productivity stagnate.\n\n'That's not a total happenstance. I think that the connection is very direct.'\n\nThe vice-president delivered his remarks at a high-profile summit hosted by venture capitalist giant Andreessen Horowitz, where he argued that the US had also been hooked on 'cheap labour' for decades due to '40 years of failed economic policy'.\n\nHe also defended President Donald Trump 's controversial use of tariffs, saying they were a 'necessary tool to protect our jobs and out industries from other countries'.\n\nMr Trump recently slapped 25 per cent tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports - with some delays until April 2 - and suggested the idea of imposing eye-watering 200 percent tariffs on European wine and spirits.\n\nBritain has already been dragged into Mr Trump's trade war after he implemented 25 per cent tariffs on iron and steel imports in a move that could further rattle the UK's already fragile economy.\n\nUS Vice President JD Vance speaks during the 2025 American Dynamism Summit on March 18, in Washington, DC. The American Dynamism Summit brings together companies, executives, and government officials and is hosted by the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz\n\nVance also defended President Donald Trump 's controversial use of tariffs, saying they were a 'necessary tool to protect our jobs and out industries from other countries'\n\nMr Vance insisted that tariffs, combined with advances in technology, would help America rebuild its manufacturing sector.\n\n'When you erect a tariff wall around a critical industry like auto manufacturing and you combine that with advanced robotics and lower energy costs and other tools that increase the productivity of US labour, you give American workers a multiplying effect,' he said.\n\n'That, in turn, allows firms to make things here at a price-competitive basis.'\n\nMr Vance's comments are likely to cause friction with Britain, as he has emerged as a sharp critic of the UK since taking office in January - despite his seemingly close ties with David Lammy, the Foreign Secretary.\n\nAt the Munich Security Conference in February, he blasted Britain and its allies for cracking down on free speech, citing the case of Adam Smith-Connor, who was arrested and convicted in 2022 for praying silently outside an abortion clinic.\n\nMr Smith-Connor told The Telegraph he was 'delighted' that Mr Vance was 'exposing the reality' of censorship in Britain.\n\nEarlier this month, Mr Vance sparked fresh outrage after downplaying Britain's military record, suggesting Britain was a 'random country' that had not 'fought a war in 30 or 40 years', which he later denied.\n\nThe US Vice President desperately attempted to clarify his comments after he sparked a furious backlash among military veterans and MPs from all parties.\n\nHe said this while he was referring to a potential peace deal to end the Ukraine war.\n\nMr Vance used a Fox News interview to pile pressure on Ukraine to sign a minerals deal with US President Donald Trump.\n\nAt the Munich Security Conference in February, Vance blasted Britain and its allies for cracking down on free speech\n\nIt comes after a number of rants Mr Vance launched on European countries, including the UK, during the Munich security conference\n\nMr Vance was accused of 'erasing from history' the sacrifice of UK personnel in those bloody conflicts, with his remarks labelled 'deeply disrespectful'\n\nHe said this was 'a way better security guarantee than 20,000 troops from some random country that hasn't fought a war in 30 or 40 years'.\n\nSeething ex-servicemen pointed out that 636 British troops died in Afghanistan and Iraq after the UK allied with the US in military action following the 9/11 terror attacks.\n\nMr Vance was accused of 'erasing from history' the sacrifice of UK personnel in those bloody conflicts, with his remarks labelled 'deeply disrespectful'.\n\nBut the Vice President later strained to claw back his remarks amid the widespread anger at his intervention.\n\nHe claimed he had not been aiming his barb at Britain or France - who are the only two countries to publicly commit to a peacekeeping force in Ukraine.\n\nYet Mr Vance failed to clarify which nations he had been referring to.\n\nHis remarks were swiftly condemned, with critics pointing out Mr Vance's own time in Iraq as a military journalist with the US Marine Corps in 2005.\n\nCritics pointed to the huge list of countries who lost troops after joining US military action in Afghanistan after 9/11.\n\nSir Keir Starmer's official spokesman said: 'The PM and this country are full of admiration for UK troops who served in recent years in Iraq and Afghanistan alongside the US and other allies.'\n\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage said Mr Vance was 'wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong'.\n\n'For 20 years in Afghanistan - pro rata our size against America's - we spent the same amount of money, we put the same number of men and women in, and we suffered the same losses,' he told GB News, as he attended a farmers' protest in Westminster.\n\n'We stood by America all through those 20 years, putting in exactly the same contribution.\n\n'And, all right, they may be six times bigger but we did our bit. So, on this one, JD is wrong.'\n\nMr Vance's latest remarks will do little to smooth tensions as Britain grapples with sluggish growth and a mounting immigration crisis.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

and led to speculation the Duke might be deported by Donald Trump .\n\nDHS had refused a Freedom of Information request from Heritage for Harry's visa files on the grounds that he may have lied about whether or not he was a drug user.\n\nIn his memoir, 'Spare', and his Netflix TV series Harry talked about using cannabis, cocaine and magic mushrooms.\n\nPrince Harry did not get special treatment when he emigrated to the United States, the Trump administration has claimed\n\nA lawyer from the Department of Homeland Security said that Harry's application followed all the 'applicable rules and regulations'\n\nThe claim was made in documents that were made public on Tuesday after a lawsuit by the Heritage Foundation, a right wing think tank, which was seeking to prove that Harry lied about his drug use on his visa papers\n\nHad he mentioned that on his immigration forms when he moved to the US in 2020, the prince could have been denied entry or faced further questioning.\n\nThe released documents include a declaration from Jarrod Panter, chief FOIA officer at DHS, who said that the agency determined it was not possible to release 'any portion' of Harry's records as anyone with a familiarity with immigration law could easily determine Harry's status.\n\nThe Duke, 40, has not publicly revealed his status in the US after immigrating in 2020 with his wife Meghan Markle, 43, with whom he has two children.\n\nPanter wrote that US immigration 'routinely protects from disclosure the nonimmigrant/immigrant status sought by third parties who do not have permission from the beneficiary to receive this information'.\n\nHe said: 'To release such information would potentially expose the individual to harm from members of the public who might have a reason to manipulate or harass individuals depending on their status in the United States'.\n\nMaking such information public could subject Harry to 'reasonably foreseeable harm in the form of harassment as well as unwanted contact by the media and others'.\n\nPanter rejected the idea that Harry had been given 'preferential treatment'.\n\nHe wrote: 'This speculation by (Heritage) does not point to any evidence of government misconduct.\n\nDespite Judge Carl Nichols vowing to release as much material as possible, Harry's actual immigration file has remained private\n\nThe six documents that were released contain heavy redactions to protect Harrys' privacy and stop him being subjected to 'harassment'\n\n'The records, as explained above, do not support such an allegation but show the regulatory process involved in reviewing and granting immigration benefits which was done in compliance with the Immigration and Nationality Act and applicable rules and regulation'.\n\nPanter's declaration contains a seven page long list of documents that were identified in the case - but all of them are redacted.\n\nFour of the other documents are declarations from records officers at DHS and they have heavy redactions too.\n\nThe sixth document is a partial transcript of an in camera hearing from April 30th 2024 in which both sides discuss the case.\n\nThere is a fleeting reference to the musician Sting and one person - it is not clear who - says: '...In whether Prince Harry or Sting or anyone else you can think of who is prominent has a particular visa status'.\n\nThe files were released after a u-turn by Judge Carl Nichols, who sits in Washington and is overseeing the case.\n\nIn September, Judge Nichols had refused the request from Heritage to release all the documents because the Duke had a right to privacy.\n\nBut after a hearing he reconsidered and said he wanted to reveal the 'maximum amount' that he could.\n\nIn September, Judge Nichols had refused the request from Heritage to release all the documents because the Duke had a right to privacy\n\nThe released documents include a declaration from Jarrod Panter, chief FOIA officer at DHS, who said that the agency determined it was not possible to release 'any portion' of Harry's records as anyone with a familiarity with immigration law could easily determine Harry's status\n\nDHS has previously argued that the records at issue are 'particularly sensitive' because they would 'reveal Harry's (immigration) status in the United States'.\n\nReleasing them would amount to a 'fishing expedition', DHS argued.\n\nThe case has led to speculation that Donald Trump might kick Harry out of the country as the President said last year he 'wouldn't protect him'.\n\nBut last month Trump changed his tune and said he wouldn't deport Harry - because his wife is 'terrible'.\n\nSpeaking to the New York Post, the President said he was giving Harry a break because 'he's got enough problems with his wife'.\n\nNile Gardiner, director of the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom at The Heritage Foundation - the Washington think tank which is behind the legal fight to get Harry's visa documents made public - spoke exclusively to DailyMail.com following the document release on Tuesday.\n\n'These documents do not in any way alter the big picture which is that Harry's visa application needs to be released to the American public in full,' he said.\n\n'The American public deserves to know how he entered the country and if he did so legally.\n\n'The documents are so heavily redacted by the Biden-era Department of Homeland Security they offer no answers at all.\n\n'I believe these documents will only reinforce calls for the release of the full Harry visa file.\n\n'The American public deserves to see Harry's records if there is nothing to hide.\n\n'These documents were written under Joe Biden's administration and offer a complete lack of transparency and accountability.\n\n'President Trump's administration has consistently promised transparency and accountability, especially on the subject of immigration.\n\n'There is a very strong possibility, in my view, that the Trump administration will release Harry's visa file in a full, unredacted and complete way.'\n\nHarry's representatives have declined to comment on the case.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

      "text": "Staggering border numbers reveal how much illegal immigration has dropped\n\nBy GERMANIA RODRIGUEZ POLEO, CHIEF U.S. REPORTER\n\nPublished: 15:45 EDT, 10 March 2025 | Updated: 16:35 EDT, 10 March 2025\n\n84\n\nView comments\n\nThe number of migrants crossing the Darien Gap on their way to the US has dropped by a staggering 99 percent.\n\nMore than 37,000 made the trek to the US through the perilous jungle that links South and Central America last year.\n\nBut in February, only 408 migrants migrants crossed through the route - the lowest number since the borders were shut down in 2020 over the Covid-19 pandemic, according to Bloomberg.\n\nMost of those making the trip last month came from Venezuela, with the rest originating from Cameroon and Bangladesh.\n\nThe jungle crossings have been dropping since September, when new Panama president Jose Raul Mulino closed multiple paths and increased security.\n\nIn the US, president Donald Trump has also clamped down on undocumented immigration, with the US-Mexico border seeing the lowest numbers of illegal crossings in decades.\n\nBorder Patrol arrested about 8,300 migrants who crossed the border unlawfully in February. That's the lowest recorded number since 2000, the earliest year of publicly-accessible monthly data.\n\nThe numbers of migrants crossing the Darien Gap to the US have dropped by 99 percent. In February, Border Patrol arrested 8,300 migrants - the lowest recorded number since 2000\n\nMigrants walk along the highway through Arriaga, Chiapas state in Mexico in January 2024. Border arrests fell sharply well before Trump took office from an all-time high of 250,000 in December 2023\n\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nCBS reporter Camilo Montoya-Galvez said he was shocked with the decrease in migration during a recent visit to the border.\n\n'Typically, when we go to the U.S./Mexico border, we at least see one group of people who are trying to cross into the U.S. illegally,' he said on CBS Mornings.\n\n'We did not see a single migrant [this time].'\n\nBorder arrests fell sharply well before Trump took office from an all-time high of 250,000 in December 2023. Mexican authorities increased enforcement within their own borders and then-President Joe Biden introduced severe asylum restrictions in June.\n\nArrests sank even further after Trump was sworn in on January 20 and issued a slew of orders on immigration, including one to suspend asylum on grounds that the United States is under 'invasion' at the southern border.\n\nLast month, Border czar Tom Homan said Monday that there were 229 border arrests in a 24-hour period, the lowest he remembered since becoming a Border Patrol agent in 1984. Homeland Security Department officials say they want to drive that to zero.\n\nHomeland Security launched a multimillion-dollar video ad campaign in the U.S. and internationally that features Secretary Kristi Noem warning people to leave or not to come.\n\n'If you are here illegally, we will find you and deport you. You will never return,' she said in the video.\n\nOver 37,000 made the trek to the US through the perilous jungle that links South and Central America last year. But in February, only 408 migrants migrants crossed through the route\n\nThe jungle crossings have been dropping since September, when new Panama president Jose Raul Mulino closed multiple paths and increased security\n\nPanama announced Friday that it will allow 112 migrants deported from the United States who have been held in a remote camp in the Darien region since last month to move about the country freely until they decide on their next course of action.\n\nThe government cited humanitarian reasons for the decision but rights lawyers promptly expressed concerns that this could be a tactic to absolve the authorities of international scrutiny for their treatment of migrants while also putting them in more danger.\n\nPresident Trump's shutting down of access to asylum and other legal routes at the U.S. southern border in January forced many migrants already in transit to reconsider their options.\n\nPanama and Costa Rica have reported seeing a reverse flow of migration as migrants begin moving south.\n\nThe two nations are now coordinating to expedite southbound migrant transit through their countries along the same route that carried hundreds of thousands north in recent years\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper .\n\nPentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder provides an update after the Oct. 7 mastermind was killed.\n\nAt rallies across the country, former President Donald Trump has pledged to enact mass deportations of illegal immigrants, something he vowed to do during his first term but never fully realized.\n\nThe latest Fox News Poll, released Thursday, finds two-thirds of voters favor such a policy - exactly where it was last December and up 15 points since the question was first asked in 2015.  Nearly one-third opposes mass deportations.\n\nSince 2015, support for deporting those living in the U.S. illegally is up across the board, but most notably among nonwhite voters (+24 points favor), Republicans (+21 points), rural voters (+20), urban voters (+19), and men (+16). Democrats are also more likely to favor this now but by a smaller 8-point margin.\n\nAt the same time, support for allowing illegal immigrants with jobs to stay in the country and apply for legal status is decreasing.  Fifty-eight percent of voters favor allowing those with jobs to stay, down 4 points from last year and 10 points since 2015.\n\nWhile support for allowing those with jobs to stay and apply for legal status is down among most demographics, Republicans are the driving force behind the dip - down 28 points from a decade ago.  Democrats are the opposite; they are more likely to favor allowing them to stay by 4 points.\n\nFOX NEWS POLL: TRUMP AHEAD OF HARRIS BY 2 POINTS NATIONALLY\n\nImmigration has been one of three top issues this election cycle, along with abortion and the economy (the top issue). The new Fox News survey is no different:  40% put the economy at number one, followed by 17% for immigration, and 15% for abortion. No other issue reaches double digits.\n\nWhen asked to name the single most important issue or factor motivating them to vote, Trump supporters cite immigration (17%) and the economy (18%) as top motivators.  For Vice President Harris supporters, it's dislike of Trump (17%), followed by abortion and protecting democracy (14% each) motivating them vote. Just 1% of Harris supporters cite immigration.\n\nBy a 15-point margin, Trump is seen as better to handle immigration, up from a 10-point advantage in September. This advantage isn't new, as the former president has been consistently beating Harris and Biden on this issue.\n\nFOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS, TRUMP IN CLOSE RACE IN NORTH CAROLINA\n\nStill, one reason the presidential race is so close is because roughly 1 in 10 voters who say immigration is their top issue (9%) back Harris, as do 1 in 10 who think Trump can better handle the immigration issue (13%).\n\nOverall, Trump has a 2-point advantage over Harris in the presidential matchup (50% to 48%) among both registered voters and likely voters, well within the margin of error.\n\nFrom the southern border to international wars...\n\n-- Voters are increasingly likely to think the U.S. should be doing less when it comes to Ukraine and its war with Russia.  Forty percent think the U.S. should be doing less, up 5 points since May and up 14 points from 2022. Roughly a quarter think we should be doing more while one third say the help is about the right amount.\n\n-- Views on U.S. support to Israel are split: 32% say too supportive, 29% not supportive enough, and 35% say it's about right. This is about where it was in May, the last time the question was asked, but since November 2023 the number saying not supportive enough has increased (21% to 29%) while those saying about right has decreased (45% to 35%).\n\n-- By 13 points, voters view Trump as better able to handle the war in the Middle East (55% Trump vs. 42% Harris).  That's up from a 7-point lead in September.\n\nConducted October 11-14, 2024 under the direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News survey includes interviews with a sample of 1,110 registered voters randomly selected from a national voter file. Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines (129) and cellphones (719) or completed the survey online after receiving a text (262). Results based on both the full registered voter sample and the subsample of 870 likely voters have a margin of sampling error of ±3 percentage points. Sampling error associated with results among subgroup is higher. In addition to sampling error, question wording and order can influence results. Weights are generally applied to age, race, education, and area variables to ensure the demographics of respondents are representative of the registered voter population. Sources for developing weight targets include the American Community Survey, Fox News Voter Analysis, and voter file data. Likely voters are based on a probabilistic statistical model that relies on past vote history, interest in the current election, age, education, race, ethnicity, church attendance, and marital status.\n\nGet all the stories you need-to-know from the most powerful name in news delivered first thing every morning to your inbox.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and\n        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

Harris currently has a 13-point lead among registered Hispanic voters, the poll showed. The Hispanic vote went to Biden by 21 points four years ago, according to a 2020 Pew Research exit poll analysis.

Of those, the U.S. filed 91 cases involving immigrants who illegally re-entered the country, and charged 103 immigrants with illegally entering the U.S.\n\n'CLOSING TIME': WHITE HOUSE, BORDER PATROL TROLL WITH DEPORTATION MEME VIDEO\n\nThe U.S. DOJ said federal prosecutors along southern border states charged over 840 illegal immigrants with immigration-related crimes during the third week of March. (U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)\n\nThe U.S. also filed 15 cases against 23 individuals accused of smuggling illegal immigrants into the U.S. through Arizona.\n\nU.S. attorneys in Central California filed charges against 17 individuals accused of illegally re-entering the U.S. after being removed, many of whom had been previously convicted of felony crimes, including assault, before being removed from the U.S.\n\nOne suspect facing additional crimes is suspected of murder, and another was arrested on suspicion of committing assault with intent to rape , the DOJ said.\n\n'SAFER WITHOUT HIM': COLUMBIA STUDENT CLAIMS CLASSMATE ARRESTED BY ICE 'HATES AMERICA'\n\nICE is conducting flights to remove illegal immigrants from the U.S. and back to their home countries. (ICE Seattle)\n\nIf an illegal immigrant returns to the U.S. after being removed, they could face up to two years in federal prison, but if they are convicted of a felony and return to the U.S., they could face between 10 and 20 years in federal prison.\n\nThe DOJ said the Southern District of California filed over 90 border-related cases, including transporting illegal aliens into the U.S., bringing immigrants into the U.S. for financial gain, re-entering the U.S. after being deported and importing controlled substances into the U.S.\n\nForty-six individuals were charged with re-entering the U.S. in New Mexico, four were charged with alien smuggling, and 27 were charged with illegal entry.\n\nPRESIDENT TRUMP COMFORTS MOTHER WHOSE SON DIED OF FENTANYL POISONING: 'UP THERE WATCHING YOU'\n\nUnder the Biden administration, Eagle Pass, Texas, had been a hot spot for illegal immigrants to enter the U.S. (Texas DPS)\n\nTexas saw the highest number of charges against illegal aliens, with 246 being filed in the Southern District of Texas , and 210 being filed in the Western District of Texas.\n\n\"We are grateful for the hard work of our border prosecutors in bringing these cases and helping to make our border safe again,\" the DOJ said.\n\nLast week, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) agents and other federal enforcement authorities arrested 81 illegal aliens as part of Operation Take Back America in Kentucky.\n\nICE and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) are close to reaching an agreement that would allow ICE to access taxpayer information to locate illegal immigrants subject to deportation.\n\nThe historic agreement would allow ICE to submit the names and addresses of illegal immigrants to cross-check against IRS tax records, which is a shift in longstanding IRS policy aimed at keeping taxpayer information strictly confidential, according to a report by the Washington Post.\n\nThe news comes as President Donald Trump has continued to ramp up the deportation effort he promised on the campaign trail, with the president attempting to use every available resource in order to aid immigration officials.\n\nFox News Digital's Michael Lee and Peter Pinedo contributed to this report.\n\nGreg Wehner is a breaking news reporter for Fox News Digital.\n\nStory tips and ideas can be sent to Greg.Wehner@Fox.com and on Twitter @GregWehner.\n\nThe hottest stories ripped from the headlines, from crime to courts, legal and scandal.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and\n        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

(Getty Images)\n\nBut some longtime IRS employees have expressed concerns about the deal, arguing that the tax agency has long assured the safeguarding of records in exchange for illegal immigrants filing tax returns, something they are required to do by law even though they are not in the country legally.\n\nThe draft agreement between the IRS and ICE would authorize verification \"subject to criminal investigation\" for violating immigration law, stretching the definition of a narrow IRS privacy exemption that allows the use of taxpayer data in the case of criminal investigations.\n\nThe deal comes as President Donald Trump has continued to increase efforts to speed up deportations, following through on one of the key promises he set on the campaign trail.\n\nAccording to Brewer, stretching the definition of criminal investigations to those who entered the country illegally would be an \"unprecedented\" step for the IRS.\n\nPresident Donald Trump promised swift deportations of illegal immigrants during the 2024 campaign. (Julia Bonavita/Fox News Digital)\n\nCOURT ORDER HALTING DEPORTATION FLIGHTS 'UNCONSTITUTIONALLY IMPEDES' EXECUTIVE BRANCH, TRUMP ALLIES ARGUE\n\n\"For the IRS to get involved in criminal investigations, that's not uncommon,\" Brewer said. \"They have done a lot of information sharing, historically, with DEA to crack down on drug proceeds, those types of things. I guess the way I'm looking at it is, if illegal immigration itself is the crime, if you look at it through that scope, then yes, it's pretty unprecedented.\"\n\n'This feels like a deviation from what we've known for years ... that if you share information with the IRS, it stops there,\" he added.\n\nBrewer believes that the agreement could also damage the credibility of the IRS, which has built trust by strictly adhering to privacy regulations.\n\n\"That would be true of any government agency if they had said, 'Hey, the DMV is going to start turning over your address to ICE.' You're going to get less people who register their vehicles or who renew their driver's license. That's just the reality,\" Brewer said.\n\nBrewer noted that a lot of illegal immigrants depend on filing their tax returns as a way to help gain their legal status, but the potential for deportation if their records are shared could dissuade them from going through the process.\n\nThe IRS has traditionally strictly kept most tax records private. (Samuel Corum/Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\n\"The IRS knows and ICE knows that these tax returns are required, and now they've really put a big disincentive in front of taxpayers from filing,\" Brewer said.\n\nBut Brewer also acknowledged that in some cases the information the IRS provides could prove to be a critical missing link for immigration authorities, pointing out that the IRS has long assisted other law enforcement agencies on other criminal matters.\n\n\"If someone just filed a tax return last month for 2024, that address information would be more recent or more likely to be accurate than some immigration document they filed last year,\" Brewer said. \"If we have the information in one department, you don't want ICE spending a ton of time and resources trying to track someone down ... just for efficiency's sake, we do want government agencies sharing information.\"\n\nMichael Lee is a writer for Fox News.

Ryan Fattman, a Republican, is sounding the alarm about the impact a ruling barring law enforcement from helping ICE has had on the state, saying it has put 'public safety in jeopardy.'\n\nMassachusetts state Sen. Ryan Fattman, a Republican, is sounding the alarm about the impact of a \"perfect storm\" of Democratic policies he says are decimating public safety while simultaneously driving up the cost of living.\n\nOne policy - instituted by the 2017 Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruling Lunn vs. Commonwealth - bars local and state law enforcement agencies from assisting with immigration enforcement.\n\nUnder the ruling, law enforcement are also not allowed to honor ICE \"detainer\" requests, often forcing police departments and sheriffs' offices to release dangerous criminal illegals onto the streets without notifying ICE.\n\nThis has led to ICE having to re-arrest several criminal illegals charged with such crimes as child rape and fentanyl trafficking after they were released by Massachusetts law enforcement agencies for bail as low as $500 or no bail at all.\n\nFattman told Fox News Digital that these cases are not isolated but rather \"are happening across the commonwealth.\"\n\nBOSTON POLICE COMMISSIONER DOUBLES DOWN ON ICE RESISTANCE: 'WE DON'T ENFORCE' DETAINERS\n\nMassachusetts state Sen. Ryan Fattman, a Republican, is sounding the alarm about the impact of a \"perfect storm\" of Democratic policies he says are decimating public safety while simultaneously driving up the cost of living. (ICE | Getty Images)\n\nHe also pointed to a Massachusetts \"Right to Shelter\" law, which has led to the creation of a vast network of migrant shelters that has cost the state upwards of $3 billion in taxpayer dollars since 2021. Whistleblowers have also called attention to \"rampant abuse\" of the shelter system by migrants, including instances of drug trafficking and a father repeatedly raping and even impregnating his teenage daughter.\n\nA public records request by the Boston Globe resulted in an over 3,000-page document detailing cases of rape, domestic violence, assault and other crimes being perpetuated by illegals living in the state-funded shelter system.\n\n\"You have a perfect storm that's happening in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,\" said Fattman. \"We have 3,000 pages of public safety incidents, 3 billion-plus dollars spent on the taxpayers' dime, and cities and towns across the commonwealth that are literally going broke.\"\n\n'RAMPANT' ABUSE IN BLUE STATE MIGRANT SHELTER SYSTEM, SAYS FORMER DIRECTOR: 'COLOSSAL MESS'\n\nMeshach Little of Northill Wilkston Security Firm walks the perimeter of the main living area at a Massachusetts emergency overflow shelter for migrants at the Melnea A. Cass Recreational Complex. (Craig F. Walker/The Boston Globe via Getty Images)\n\nHe placed the onus for the state of the crisis on Massachusetts Democratic Gov. Maura Healey, as well as the Democratic majority legislature.\n\n\"Ninety-nine percent of political asylum cases in our immigration courts get rejected,\" he said. \"So, the premise that these individuals will come to the commonwealth, and many of whom are good people, and that they might be able to work here, make lives here, it's not true. So, we have spent $3 billion on 99% of people who are never going to be legal residents of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. We have lit the money on fire, and that is wrong.\"\n\n\"This is insanity, and it must change,\" he continued. \"People are tired of this. They want safety for their children and their families. They want to be able to walk down the street and know that there's nothing bad that's going to happen to them, that they can work hard and get ahead. And that is not happening in the commonwealth.\"\n\nIn efforts to curb the insanity, Fattman introduced a bill called the \"Shield Act\" that would essentially overturn the Lunn decision by authorizing local and state law enforcement agencies to work with ICE to ensure criminal illegal immigrants are kept off the streets.\n\nDEMOCRAT MAYOR BLASTED FOR VOWING TO MAKE MAJOR CITY 'SAFE HAVEN' FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS\n\nICE, along with law enforcement partners, arrested 370 immigrant offenders during an enhanced operation in Massachusetts. (ICE)\n\nThough Massachusetts is a solid blue state, Fattman is optimistic that citizens are going to demand change from their leaders one way or another.\n\n\"This is, I think, a situation that has become untenable politically for many people,\" he said, adding that the Lunn decision specifically says that the \"legislature needs to create a law in order for this law to exist, that no law exists so, therefore, the ICE detainers don't have to be honored and the remedy is the legislature acting.\"\n\n\"Massachusetts is viewed as a blue state, but there are large, large swaths of purple and red parts of the state and those places are just fed up,\" he went on. \"They're fed up as individuals watching the headlines, seeing that their neighbors being assaulted, pregnant women are being injured at the hands of people who are not lawfully present in our state or country.\"\n\n\"To add insult to injury, we have said, come here, we'll pay for you, for your food, for your education, for your healthcare, and for your shelter, and it's cost billions of dollars,\" Fattman added. \"We're getting to a critical mass where the pressure points are about at explosion.\"\n\nPeter Pinedo is a politics writer for Fox News Digital.\n\nGet the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more Fox News politics content.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and\n        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

Circuit Court of Appeals presided over Monday's oral arguments, which they agreed to hear last week on an expedited basis.\n\nThe back-and-forth Monday was dominated primarily by Millett, an Obama appointee, who seemed to be clearly on the plaintiffs' side. She sparred with Justice Department lawyer Drew Ensign over the Trump administration's implementation of the law in question, and whether the administration violated constitutional due process protections in possibly failing to allow individuals targeted for deportation enough time to seek habeas protections.\n\nIn a concurring opinion of the ruling, Henderson, a Bush appointee, said: \"At this early stage, the government has yet to show a likelihood of success on the merits. The equities favor the plaintiffs. And the district court entered the TROs for a quintessentially valid purpose: to protect its remedial authority long enough to consider the parties' arguments.\n\n'WOEFULLY INSUFFICIENT': US JUDGE REAMS TRUMP ADMIN FOR DAYS-LATE DEPORTATION INFO\n\nThe Trump administration had attempted to invoke a 1798 wartime authority to deport Venezuelan nationals, including alleged members of the gang Tren de Aragua (TdA), for a period of 14 days. (Getty Images)\n\n\"Accordingly, and for the foregoing reasons, the request to stay the district court's TROs should be denied.\"\n\nTheir decision could ultimately be kicked to the Supreme Court for further review.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi sharply criticized lower court judges for involving themselves in immigration issues, vowing in an interview on Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures\" to appeal the case to the Supreme Court for review if necessary.\n\n\"This is an out-of-control judge, a federal judge, trying to control our entire foreign policy, and he cannot do it,\" Bondi said of the lower court decisions.\n\nAt issue was the Trump administration's authority to invoke the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 wartime law, to immediately deport Venezuelan nationals , including alleged members of the Tren de Aragua (TdA) gang, from U.S. soil.\n\nU.S. District Judge James Boasberg issued a temporary restraining order last weekend blocking the Trump administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan nationals, citing the need to better consider the merits of the case - and prompting the administration to file an emergency request for the U.S. appeals court to intervene.\n\nJUSTICE DEPARTMENT TELLS FEDERAL JUDGE IT MIGHT INVOKE STATE SECRETS ACT ON HIGH-PROFILE DEPORTATION CASE\n\n\"The government isn't being forthcoming... but I will get to the bottom of if they complied with my order and who violated the order, and what the consequences are,\" Boasberg said during a hearing. (Getty)\n\nBoasberg also issued a bench ruling ordering the Trump administration to return any planes to the U.S. that were carrying Venezuelan nationals or any other migrants subject to deportations under the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nDespite his order, planes carrying hundreds of U.S. migrants, including Venezuelan nationals removed under the law, arrived in El Salvador hours later.\n\nThe Trump administration had filed an emergency appeal of Boasberg's order that same day, describing his restraining order as a \"massive, unauthorized imposition on the Executive's authority to remove dangerous aliens who pose threats to the American people \" in its initial filing.\n\nDuring Monday's hearing, Justice Department lawyers were pressed by the appellate judges over the timing of the deportations, and whether the individuals deported under the law had any time to seek relief or challenge their status as a TdA member in the form of a habeas petition before they were sent to El Salvador.\n\nMillett told Justice Department attorney Drew Ensign that it appeared that there was not much time between Trump's signing of a proclamation that authorized the use of the Alien Enemies Act to immediately deport Venezuelan nationals believed to be members of TdA and its first wave of deportation flights to El Salvador.\n\nTRUMP DOJ HAMMERS JUDGE'S 'DIGRESSIVE MICROMANAGEMENT,' SEEKS MORE TIME TO ANSWER 5 QUESTIONS\n\nJudges Karen Henderson, Patricia Millett and Justin Walker of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals presided over oral arguments on March 24 after the Trump administration appealed Boasberg's March 15 order. (David Ake/Getty Images)\n\nIf the Trump administration's argument is that the restraining order handed down by a lower court judge last week is \"an intrusion on the president's war powers, and [that] the courts are paralyzed to do anything, then that's a misreading of precedent,\" Millett said.\n\n\"And it's a misreading of the text of the Alien Enemies Act. The president has to comply with the Constitution and laws like everybody else,\" she added.\n\nBoasberg had ordered the Trump administration last week to submit more information to the court about its deportation flights as part of a fact-finding hearing to determine whether they knowingly defied his court order that blocked the deportations.\n\nThe Justice Department repeatedly declined to do so, even after he offered the opportunity for them to do so under seal, prompting a scathing response from Boasberg last week.\n\nThe video depicts suspected members of Tren de Aragua and MS-13. (@nayibbukele via X)\n\nIn a reply brief filed to the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, lawyers for the Trump administration argued that the district court is \"continuing to attempt to pry sensitive information from the Government,\" describing the requests from Boasberg as \"intrusive inquiries\" and ones they said \"could hamper negotiations in the future.\"\n\nBoasberg wrote that the government had submitted a six-paragraph declaration from a regional ICE office director in Harlingen, Texas , which notified the court that Cabinet secretaries are \"actively considering whether to invoke the state secrets [act] privileges over the other facts requested by the Court's order.\"\n\nIn a separate district court hearing, Boasberg pressed the government's attorneys, at one point questioning them on their credibility.\n\n\"So, your clients had you come argue this but kept you in the dark about it,\" Boasberg said. \"I often tell my clerks before they go out to practice law, that the most valuable thing they have is their reputation and their credibility. I would ask that your team retain that lesson.\"\n\n\"The government isn't being forthcoming... but I will get to the bottom of if they complied with my order and who violated the order, and what the consequences are,\" Boasberg said during the hearing.\n\nHaley Chi-Sing is a politics writer for Fox News Digital.

      "text": "'Ignoring The Law Altogether': Tom Homan Swats Down Worries About 'Due Process' For Deported Gang Members\n\nBorder czar Tom Homan clashed with \"This Week\" guest host Jonathan Karl over the Trump administration's efforts to deport members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua (TdA).\n\nUnited States District Judge James Boasberg of the District of Columbia issued an injunction March 15 ordering the Trump administration to turn around two planes carrying members of the Venezuelan gang to El Salvador. Homan erupted when Karl raised the issue of \"due process\" with the deportations.\n\n\"Due process - where is Laken Riley's due process? Where are all these young women killed and raped by members of the TdA? Where was their due process? The young woman on the subway, where is her due process?\" Homan asked Karl.\n\nWATCH:\n\n\"The bottom line is, that plane was full of people designated as terrorists, number one. Number two, every Venezuelan migrant on that flight was a TdA member based on numerous criminal investigations, on intelligence reports, and a lot of work by ICE officers,\" Homan added. \"As a matter of fact, two days after that flight took off, I even had a discussion with the acting director of ICE, and he reiterated that every person, every Venezuelan on that plane was a known member of the TdA. So, a lot of officers, criminal investigators, special agents who have done this for decades, looked at the intelligence information, the criminal investigation information, all the various social media and surveillance and government records and public records and they are confident they're all members of the TdA.\"\n\nUpon taking office on Jan. 20, President Donald Trump issued several executive orders to address illegal immigration, including designating Mexican drug cartels, TdA and MS-13, an El Salvadoran prison gang, as foreign terrorist organizations. TdA is a violent gang whose members have allegedly been involved in the takeover of apartment complexes in Aurora, Colorado , kidnapping and murder .\n\n\"They were given due process according to the laws on the books. See, that's the difference between the Trump Administration and the Biden Administration,\" Homan said. \"We're actually using the laws on the books to enforce immigration laws and secure the border at the highest level it's ever been.\"\n\n\"The Biden Administration not only ignored the law, they violated the law like the district court and in district five said that not only were they violating the law, they were actually ignoring the law altogether,\" Homan continued. \"We are using the laws on the books to enforce our border immigration laws and enforcement. If you look, the border numbers are down 96%. We already got 40,000 criminals removed by I.C.E. In the interior which more was done in six weeks than the Biden administration did in a year. We're using the laws on the books. We're not making this up.\"\n\nThe Border Patrol encountered millions of illegal immigrants since the start of fiscal year 2021, according to figures released by U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP). Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced Feb. 25 that only 200 illegal immigrants were apprehended at the U.S.-Mexico border, the lowest single-day total in 15 years.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Josh Breechen (R-Okla.) said illegal immigrants have no constitutional rights to be in the U.S. in the first place, and noted that the U.S. is a nation of laws.\n\n\"America is a nation of laws, and if we allow those laws to be subverted by illegal aliens who have no constitutional right to be here in the first place, then we will cease to be a nation,\" Breechen said.\n\nRep. Brian Babin (R-Texas) has proposed his own legislation that would end birthright citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants and noted that it aims to end \"birth tourism.\" The bill came after President Donald Trump had signed an executive order also seeking to end birthright citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants.\n\n\"It's going to have a huge impact on our immigration system because it's going to close loopholes that exploit birthright citizenship and discourage illegal immigration and end the misuse of this really, this completely misinterpreted privilege,\" Babin said.\n\nThe Daily Wire further reported that since Trump took office, illegal crossings on the southern border have dropped by 98%.\n\nIJR, Contributor Writer\n\nJoin Over 6M Subscribers\n\nWe're organizing an online community to elevate trusted voices on all sides so that you can be fully informed.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR\n\nLogin to your account below\n\nRemember Me\n\nPlease enter your username or email address to reset your password.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR"

      "text": "Illegal Migrants Hit Exit As Trump Rolls Up Biden's Welcome Mat\n\nFaced with a new administration laser focused on mass deportation and the real possibility of being sent to a mega-prison in Central America, many illegal migrants are choosing to hit the exit button voluntarily.\n\nA number of foreign nationals in Denver, the city that absorbed the most illegal migrants per capita than any other major U.S. city, are becoming far more receptive to the idea of self-deportation, according to a report from the New York Times. The current sentiment is a sea change from the Biden-era, when immigration officials allowed millions of foreign nationals to apply for asylum and remain.\n\nChristian, a 29-year-old Venezuelan national who arrived in Denver in 2023, obtained a work permit and requested asylum, according to the NYT. However, he told the outlet that his feelings have changed \"360 degrees\" since Trump returned to the White House, and he has since made an appointment with a judge to request voluntary departure from the U.S.\n\n\"I just hope to manage to leave before they deport me,\" Jesus, a 29-year-old Venezuelan, said to the NYT. He arrived in the U.S. in 2024 and was detained for some time before being released. He now says he'd rather return voluntarily to his home country rather than be detained again.\n\nThe current crackdown is a major deviation from the asylum policies implemented in the past four years. The Biden administration expanded the CBP One app, constructed Safe Mobility Offices across Latin America and established the CHNV program - all of which streamlined migrants' ability to apply for asylum and enter the U.S. en masse before the Trump administration scrapped or defunded them all.\n\nMore than 18 million illegal migrants are estimated to be living in the U.S., according to the most recent study released by the Federation for American Immigration Reform. Those new figures were released after 8.5 million migrant encounters were recorded along the U.S.-Mexico border during the four fiscal years of the Biden administration.\n\nThe Biden White House oversaw the worst humanitarian crisis at the southern border in history, with fiscal years 2023 and 2024 being the highest and second highest, respectively, of recorded migrant encounters, according to Customs and Border Protection data. Before Biden finally issued an election-year directive that began a slowdown of encounters, millions of illegal migrants had already entered the country.\n\nAfter winning election to a second term in an electoral landslide, in part on a pledge to crack down on the illegal immigration crisis, President Donald Trump got to work on enforcement reforms. The Trump administration deployed troops at the southern border, successfully coerced Canada and Mexico to put more effort into border security and designated a number of transnational gangs and cartels as foreign terrorist organizations.\n\nTrump also threw the hammer down on interior enforcement, successfully pushing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents to apprehend tens of thousands of illegal migrants in the first months of his administration. The ICE arrests, which far surpass the rate of the previous administration, included convicted criminals and gangbangers loyal to Tren de Aragua, MS-13 and other ruthless crime syndicates.\n\nIn an unprecedented agreement, the Trump administration reached a deal with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele allowing U.S. authorities to transport criminal illegal migrants to the Terrorism Confinement Center (CECOT), a mega-prison in El Salvador that has the capacity to hold up to 40,000 inmates. The maximum-security prison is not known for being a relaxing venue, where prisoners are packed tightly into cells, recreation and visitation are forbidden and cellphone signals are blocked.\n\nWhile Trump fights a court challenge on his use of wartime powers to deport Tren de Aragua gang members, media attention has surrounded the Venezuelan nationals who were already deported to the mega-prison.\n\nWhile Venezuelans see some of their countrymen be sent to one of the largest prisons in the world, the Trump administration is encouraging all illegal migrants to leave on their own accord. Earlier in March, the administration rolled out the CBP Home app - a relaunch of the Biden-era CBP One app that now includes a feature for illegal migrants to declare their intentions to self-deport.\n\n\"The Biden Administration exploited the CBP One app to allow more than 1 million aliens to illegally enter the United States,\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem previously said. \"With the launching of the CBP Home app, we are restoring integrity to our immigration system.\"\n\n\"The CBP Home app gives aliens the option to leave now and self-deport, so they may still have the opportunity to return legally in the future and live the American dream,\" Noem went on. \"If they don't, we will find them, we will deport them, and they will never return.\"\n\nRanjani Srinivasan, an Indian national student allegedly involved in anti-Israel protests at Columbia University, notably used the app to leave the U.S. after the State Department revoked her student visa. Foreign nationals in Chicago, Ohio, and elsewhere across the U.S. have also self-deported, according to the NYT.\n\nThe monumental push for self-deportation -  and the subsequent signs of success of this effort -  appear as a far cry from years past. When then-Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney touted self-deportation as a viable immigration enforcement plan during a 2012 GOP debate, he drew audible laughs from the audience. Other critics at the time blasted the idea as a strategy blunder.\n\nHowever, under Trump's unprecedented crackdown on illegal immigration, the policy appears to be all the more realistic.\n\nRather than go through the trouble of remaining on the run, one 23-year-old Venezuelan illegal migrant walked into a Detroit ICE office building in February and surrendered himself to authorities. The migrant reportedly told agents he needed to be taken into custody or else he'd go on to commit crimes.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "Trump DHS Begins Sending Notices To Migrants Biden Paroled Into US: Pack Your Bags\n\nTermination notices are being delivered to hundreds of thousands of migrants who entered the United States through a fraud-ridden parole program launched by the Biden administration.\n\nThe Trump White House earlier in March terminated the CHNV program, an initiative launched by the previous administration that flew in over half-a-million migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela over the past several years. The hundreds of thousands of foreign nationals enrolled in the program began receiving notices Thursday that their temporary status on CHNV is being terminated, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) confirmed.\n\nIn a public statement confirming the termination letters, DHS called CHNV a \"disastrous\" program and ripped the Biden White House for importing \"loosely vetted\" migrants en masse that competed with American workers.\n\n\"The previous administration lied to America,\" a senior DHS official said Thursday.\n\n\"They allowed more than half a million loosely vetted aliens from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela and their immediate family members to enter the United States through these disastrous parole programs; granted them opportunities to compete for American jobs and undercut American workers; forced career civil servants to promote the programs even when fraud was identified; and then blamed Republicans in Congress for the chaos that ensued and the crime that followed,\" the senior official continued.\n\nFirst launched by the Biden administration in October 2022 for Venezuelans, the CHNV program was later expanded in January 2023 to include Haitian, Nicaraguan and Cuban nationals. The mass parole initiative gave foreign nationals two-year authorization into the U.S. and work permits, provided they had not previously entered the country unlawfully and cleared other vetting processes.\n\nHowever, the program quickly began taking flak. Republicans accused the Biden administration of using CHNV - and other maneuvers, like the expansion of the CBP One app - to allow otherwise-inadmissible aliens into the U.S. en masse as a way to loosen pressure on the southerner border, which was experiencing a massive crisis at the time.\n\nDuring its peak, CHNV was flying roughly 30,000 migrants into the U.S. every single month, allowing them to circumvent the U.S.-Mexico border entirely.\n\nIn August 2024, Biden's DHS confirmed the program was placed on pause following an internal audit that uncovered rampant fraud. The internal report identified a long slate of red flags, such as 100,948 CHNV forms being completed by just 3,218 sponsors, 24 of the 1,000 most used Social Security numbers by sponsors belonging to a deceased person and an IP address located in Tijuana, Mexico, being used more than 1,300 times, among other discrepancies.\n\nIn October 2024, the Biden administration announced it would not be renewing parole for CHNV enrollees. The Trump administration earlier in March took this a step further by nixing the program altogether, meaning CHNV migrants will lose their deportation protections and work permits by the end of April.\n\n\"The Biden-Harris administration abused its limited authority to grant parole to inadmissible aliens en masse through programs like the Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan parole program (CHNV), which allowed inadmissible aliens entry partially on the basis that a 'sponsor' agreed to financially support them,\" said House Homeland Security Chairman Mark Green and other subcommittee chairmen in a Wednesday letter to DHS, asking for more information of the Biden White House's use of mass parole for non-citizens.\n\n\"The Biden-Harris administration went to great lengths to maintain this unconstitutional abuse of the Secretary's parole authority despite indications that prospective sponsors were financing their income through illegal activities and were engaging in fraud,\" the chairman continued.\n\nThe actions around CHNV are just a facet of President Donald Trump's hawkish immigration platform. His administration has dramatically beefed up border security, escalated immigration apprehensions and scored numerous high-profile arrests of foreign student protesters accused of Hamas sympathies.\n\nTermination notices to CHNV parolees will continue to be doled out in batches, according to DHS. Roughly 175,000 notices will be sent per day, with all 500,000 or so being delivered by Monday morning. Enrollees will need to find an alternative legal means to remain in the U.S., leave on their own accord or face deportation.\n\n\"The termination of the CHNV parole programs, and the termination of parole for those who exploited it, is a return to common-sense policies, a return to public safety, and a return to America First,\" the senior DHS official said.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "James Carville Says Dems Lost On Immigration Because Biden Listened To 'Idiotic Far-Left'\n\nDemocratic strategist James Carville said Friday that the Democratic Party lost on immigration in the 2024 election because President Joe Biden took advice from the \"idiotic far-left.\"\n\nBorder officials encountered a record-high of over 2 million illegal immigrants throughout Biden's term in office, prompting concerns about immigration and drawing attention toward heinous crimes committed by illegal migrants. During an interview on \"Piers Morgan Uncensored,\" Carville said the far-left influenced the last administration to keep the border unsecured and caused the massive immigration crisis witnessed by Americans throughout the past four years.\n\n\"In terms of the border, all of that is because Biden listened to the idiotic far-left,\" Carville told Piers Morgan. \"And by the time that he left office, the border was a very orderly place, a lot of good it did us, but it's really true if you look at the crossing statistics. Every person in history that has listened, not just to the far-left in the United States but anybody in the West, that pays attention to the far-left has lived to regret it. These people have never been right about a single thing. Nothing, and they keep running their mouths.\"\n\nWATCH:\n\nDuring the Biden administration, migrant encounters exceeded 2.4 million and 2.1 million in the 2023 and 2024 fiscal years, with a record of over 300,000 migrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border in Dec. 2023, according to Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data. Border encounters dropped once Trump won the 2024 election in November, prompting would-be illegal immigrants and migrant caravans to turn around and avoid crossing the border.\n\nThe record number of border crossings and catch-and-release policies of the Biden administration led to the murders of 22-year-old Laken Riley, 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray and 37-year-old Rachel Morin at the hands of illegal immigrants. The convicted killer of Riley traveled from New York to Athens, Georgia, on a humanitarian flight after having been arrested in New York City for allegedly acting in a manner to injure a child less than 17 years old.\n\nAn increasing number of Americans believe illegal immigration is a massive security threat and support mass deportations. One poll from August found that 50% of Americans believe large numbers of migration poses a \"critical threat\" to the U.S., and polls found that most Americans support the use of the military at the border and deportation operations.\n\nTrump put an end to the migrant crisis almost immediately once he took office on Jan. 20, with encounters and apprehensions declining to record lows. Trump announced there were only 8,326 apprehensions during his first full month in office, while Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said there were 200 migrant encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border on Feb. 22, marking the lowest single-day apprehension number in over 15 years.\n\nBorder czar Tom Homan, who started as a border agent over 40 years ago, said in a Feb. 17 statement that he does not recall ever seeing  border crossing numbers that low in a single day.\n\nBiden, along with other Democrats, claimed that they could not secure the border without an act of Congress. The Trump administration, however, has made significant changes to the border without any piece of legislation passed by Congress.\n\nSince Trump took office, ICE arrests surged by 627% in comparison to the last administration, with agents arresting over 20,000 illegal immigrants in a single month, according to Homeland Security.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

The administration also announced it would be rolling back the \"broad use\" of humanitarian parole and returning it to a case-by-case basis.\n\nThe Trump administration lauded the moves as a step away from the soft-on-enforcement approach taken by the previous White House.\n\n\"This action empowers the brave men and women in [Customs and Border Protection] and ICE to enforce our immigration laws and catch criminal aliens - including murders and rapists - who have illegally come into our country,\" a DHS spokesperson said of the revocation of sensitive locations. \"Criminals will no longer be able to hide in America's schools and churches to avoid arrest.\"\n\n\"The Trump Administration will not tie the hands of our brave law enforcement, and instead trusts them to use common sense,\" the spokesperson continued.\n\nAn ICE memo establishing \"sensitive locations\" was introduced in October 2011, which mostly prohibited ICE agents from entering schools, hospitals or churches. However, this list was expanded incredibly under the Biden administration to include broad areas of social services and public spaces, limiting the scope where ICE agents could work.\n\nThe second directive announced Tuesday includes a phaseout of parole programs that allowed migrants to enter and work in the U.S. en masse under the Biden administration. Republicans have long criticized parole initiatives such as the CHNV program for being rife with fraud and allowing hundreds of thousands of migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela into the U.S.\n\n\"The Biden-Harris Administration abused the humanitarian parole program to indiscriminately allow 1.5 million migrants to enter our country,\" the DHS spokesperson said. \"This was all stopped on day one of the Trump Administration.\"\n\n\"This action will return the humanitarian parole program to its original purpose of looking at migrants on a case-by-case basis,\" the spokesperson continued.\n\nThe two directives were issued by acting DHS Director Benjamine Huffman. If confirmed, South Dakota Republican Gov. Kristi Noem will be taking the reins at the department.\n\nOn his first day back in office, President Donald Trump issued a slate of executive orders that declared a national emergency at the border, designated cartels as terrorist organizations and sought to reinterpret the 14th Amendment as denying birthright citizenship for individuals born on U.S. soil by illegal migrant parents.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "Trump Admin Hastens End Of Biden-Era Migrant Parole Program Riddled With Fraud\n\nThe Trump administration is set to put an end to a Biden-era program on Tuesday that paroled hundreds of thousands of foreign nationals into the United States during the height of the southern border crisis.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced the determination of the CHNV program, a sponsorship process that brought in roughly 530,000 non-citizens from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, per a memo released by the agency. The Biden administration launched the CHNV program in 2022 in an attempt to help alleviate the U.S.-Mexico border crisis and continued to parole thousands into the country every month despite internal reports indicating massive fraud.\n\n\"DHS has determined that it is now appropriate and necessary to terminate the CHNV parole programs,\" Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote in the notice. \"These programs do not serve a significant public benefit, are not necessary to reduce levels of illegal immigration, did not sufficiently mitigate the domestic effects of illegal immigration, are not serving their intended purposes, and are inconsistent with the Administration's foreign policy goals.\"\n\n\"Regarding previous arguments or determinations that these programs were consistent with the requirement of 'urgent humanitarian reasons' for granting parole, DHS believes that consideration of any urgent humanitarian reasons for granting parole is best addressed on a case-by-case basis consistent with the statute, and taking into consideration each alien's specific circumstances,\" Noem continued. \"These reasons, independently and cumulatively, support termination of the CHNV parole programs.\"\n\nFirst launched for Venezuelans in October 2022, the CHNV program was later expanded in January 2023 to include Haitian, Nicaraguan and Cuban nationals. The mass parole initiative gave foreign nationals two-year authorization into the U.S. and work permits, provided they had not previously entered the U.S. illegally and passed other vetting processes.\n\nHundreds of thousands of migrants were flying into the U.S. each month under the program. However, the initiative was plagued with massive accounts of fraud, forcing the Biden administration to place it on hold in August 2024.\n\nIn August 2024, Biden's DHS confirmed that they placed the program on pause following an internal audit. That report identified a litany of red flags, such as 100,948 CHNV forms being completed by just 3,218 sponsors, 24 of the 1,000 most used Social Security numbers by sponsors belonging to a deceased person and an IP address located in Tijuana, Mexico, being used more than 1,300 times.\n\nDespite the rampant fraud, the Biden administration chose to resume the CHNV program. However, the administration in October ultimately decided that it would not extend parole for those who entered through CHNV - meaning these migrants knew their time in the U.S. was drawing to a close well before President Donald Trump re-entered office in January.\n\nRepublicans long argued that the program was a farce, flying otherwise-inadmissible aliens into the U.S. en masse in order to keep pressure off the southern border.\n\n\"The CHNV program, along with the use of the CBP One app at the Southwest border, has helped the president and his border czar play a massive shell game, encouraging otherwise-inadmissible aliens to simply cross at ports of entry instead of between them,\" House Homeland Security Chairman Mark Green said in a n August statement , in reaction to the Biden administration's decision to resume the program.\n\nAn investigation by the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington, D.C.,-based immigration group, uncovered that many of the migrants who entered the U.S. through CHNV had already settled in incredibly stable and prosperous countries, including many wealthy nations in Western Europe - drawing into question the legitimacy of their needs for parole into the U.S.\n\nCHNV enrollees in the U.S. will lose their deportation protections and work permits by the end of April, per Noem's memo. They will need to establish other legal means of remaining in the U.S., self-deport or be forcibly repatriated by federal immigration authorities.\n\n\"One of the stated goals of the CHNV parole programs was to promote the foreign policy objectives of the prior administration,\" the DHS secretary stated. \"The foreign policy objectives underlying the CHNV parole programs, however, are not consistent with those of the current Administration.\"\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "STEVE CORTES: Americans Overwhelmingly Back Trump's Deportation Agenda\n\nAmericans overwhelmingly support the Trump-Vance administration's moves on border and immigration issues and demand a return to law-and-order over migration issues. These beliefs cut across ideological and demographic lines, consistent with the mandate victory earned by President Donald Trump last November.\n\nSpecifically, by a +19% margin, Americans back broad, mass deportations of all illegal aliens by a 56%-37% spread. In a country that is politically polarized, where most issues breakdown roughly 47%-47% along party lines, that kind of margin on a controversial topic like immigration, it points to an emerging consensus in the country.\n\nDespite years of legacy media promoting open borders, and in the face of former President Joe Biden's constant lies about his supposed helplessness to control the border, the American people clearly move decidedly to the political right on this macro issue. This polling data comes from TIPP Insight , a highly respected polling firm commissioned by my populist pro-laborer advocacy organization, the League of American Workers . The national survey questioned 1,720 registered voters, who split by +1% for Trump over Harris, exactly in line with the actual 2024 election returns.\n\nThe poll also asked specifically about migrants in America with criminal records, either in their own country, or here in America (in addition to the crime of trespassing into our country). Approval for deporting those aliens rises to a whopping +65%, with a 79%-14% margin. Among senior citizens, the public verdict is damn near unanimous, with a 93%-4% approval for deporting criminals immediately. Hispanics show 69% support for these deportations, political independents at 80% and even Kamala Harris Voters at 71% approval.\n\nSo, Trump's election victory was a mandate, winning every swing state and the national popular vote, the first Republican to do so in two decades . That groundswell was earned, largely, through a foundational focus on Biden's out-of-control migration madness. So, the electoral wave translates into an immigration mandate, as verified by this decisive polling data.\n\nSo, why have Americans moved so aggressively toward Trump and in favor of strict law enforcement regarding immigration? There are three primary reasons:\n\nThankfully, help has arrived. As the Daily Caller's Reagan Reese recently detailed on her trip to the southern border with Vice President JD Vance, this administration has made early and swift progress toward securing the border. Vance also promised to finish building the border wall by the end of this current term. It is a new day in America, and we once again control the flow of immigration to this country, in clear alignment with the expressed will of the citizens of our great republic.\n\nSteve Cortes is senior political advisor to Catholic Vote and president of the League of American Workers, a populist right pro-laborer advocacy group.

However, in February, they agreed to release redacted versions of the forms - as long as the disclosure would not violate Harry's privacy.\n\nDrug use is not a barrier to obtaining a visa, but lying about it can make the process more difficult. In theory, if Harry failed to reveal drug usage on his visa application, he could technically be removed.\n\nIn his 2023 book \"Spare,\" Harry confesses to taking part in cocaine use, among other narcotics.\n\n\"Of course I had been taking cocaine at that time.

      "text": "Trump Shuts Down Biden's Migrant CBP App, Canceling All Pending Immigration Appointments\n\nOAN Staff Blake Wolf 1:54 PM - Monday, January 20, 2025\n\nIn one of his first executive orders, President Donald Trump ordered the shutdown of the mobile app introduced by the Biden administration that migrants utilized to attain visas and gain access into the U.S., canceling all of the upcoming pending appointments.\n\nThe CBP One app previously allowed migrants to make their case for asylum by scheduling appointments with Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials.\n\nRoughly 270,000 migrants waiting for appointments in Mexico will now have to wait a longer duration to have their cases heard - as the Trump administration implements its tightened immigration reform policies.\n\nUp to 1,450 migrants were allowed to schedule immigration appointments per day, as tens of thousands of migrants have utilized the app to enter into the United States during the Biden administration.\n\nSurfacing video footage shows migrants, right outside of the Southern border, openly sobbing after learning that their appointments were canceled.\n\nMigrants in Ciudad Juárez who were waiting for their 1 pm CBP1 parole appointments learned 20 minutes ago that the app has shut down & those appointments are no longer valid. pic.twitter.com/F3pNrZyEBR\n\n\"Effective January 20, 2025 at 12:00 PM Eastern Time, the functionalities of CBP ONE that previously allowed undocumented aliens to submit advance information and schedule appointments at eight southwest border ports of entry is no longer available. All appointments have been cancelled,\" the agency announced.\n\n🚨BREAKING: The Biden administration's CBP One app, which facilitated the transportation of over 1 million illegal immigrants on domestic flights, has been officially shut down. pic.twitter.com/BwiUCt52eH\n\nRoughly 96,000 foreign nationals were encountered at the border just in December, according to the CBP, with around half attempting to attain formal admission into the United States.\n\nThe CBP app also played a key role in the Biden administration's effort to incentivize \"legal\" immigration to the U.S. while illegal immigration, prompted by Democrats' loose \"catch and release\" border policies, continued to spiral out of control.\n\nBy allowing foreigners the chance to come to the U.S. with help from the app, some analysts claim that it was a crafty way for the Biden administration to argue that they were combating illegal immigration by helping facilitate \"legal\" immigration.\n\nLast year, NYC Democrat Mayor Eric Adams received backlash from his own party after demanding that Biden send New York more federal funding in order to keep up with the influx of illegals who were committing violent crimes and taking up Americans' taxpayer-funded resources.\n\nAs migrants were made aware that Democrat officials were responsible for providing their U.S. taxpayer-funded clothing, food, housing, and more, made possible by migrant debit cards with differing amounts of money on them, depending on how many children one has and other factors - then they would most likely become Democrat voters in the future, GOP politicians argue.\n\nPresident Trump is expected to sign an additional number of executive orders aiming to undue many of Biden's disastrous border policies.\n\n\"I will declare a national emergency at our southern border. All illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came,\" Trump stated prior to being sworn-in.\n\n\"We will reinstate my remain in Mexico policy. I will end the practice of catch and release. And I will send troops to the southern border to repel the disastrous invasion of our country. Under the orders I signed today, we will also be designating the cartels as foreign terrorist organizations,\" Trump continued.\n\n\"And by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil including our cities and inner cities,\" he added.\n\nThe Remain in Mexico policy previously implemented in Trump's first administration requires migrants seeking asylum to wait in Mexico until their cases are heard, disincentivizing migration to the United States.\n\nStay informed!

Bondi described the suspect, who was \"living half an hour outside of Washington, D.C.,\" as one of the \"top leaders\" and \"top domestic terrorists\" in MS-13.\n\nThe arrest comes as the Trump administration ramps up law enforcement in response to record-high illegal crossings under the Biden administration. Immigration and Customs Enforcement deported 28,319 illegal aliens between January 20 and March 11, the agency told Newsweek . Trump in a Thursday post on Truth Social praised the arrest and called his border czar, Tom Homan, a \"superstar.\"\n\nWhile officials are not yet identifying the suspect, Bondi described him as \"one of the top members, top three in the entire country, head of the East Coast, one of the three leaders,\" who committed \"very violent crimes ... anything you can associate with MS-13.\"\n\n\"He should not have been in this country,\" Bondi said.\n\n\"This is what happens when you let good cops be cops,\" said FBI director Kash Patel, who appeared alongside Bondi and Virginia governor Glenn Youngkin (R.) at the press conference.\n\n\"Thanks to the brave leadership of this administration and the folks that you see here, we are returning our communities to safety,\" Patel said.\n\nThe MS-13 gang, formally known as Mara Salvatrucha, was formed in the 1980s by Salvadoran immigrants in Los Angeles. The group is notorious for brutal violence, including machete attacks and executions, with many members trained in guerrilla warfare.\n\n\"MS-13, they are organized. They are violent. They are committing homicides throughout our country,\" Bondi said. \"They are one of the most dangerous gangs in our country, and we are going to fight until they are completely dismantled.\"\n\nPublished under: Crime , Illegal Immigration , Kash Patel , MS-13 , Pam Bondi , Trump Administration\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "Taxpayer-Funded Immigration Group Chaired by DOJ Employee Wants To Abolish ICE, Defund Police\n\nA left-wing group battling the Trump administration to maintain lucrative taxpayer-funded immigration contracts has called to defund police departments and abolish the federal agency that deports illegal aliens.\n\nImmigrant Defenders Law Center (ImmDef), a nonprofit chaired by Department of Justice employee Marisa Arrona, has received $17 million in federal funding since last year to provide legal services to illegal aliens facing deportation, according to federal records. ImmDef is a subcontractor for a $769 million program to provide services to minors apprehended at the border without parents.\n\nImmDef and its allies are desperately fighting against the Trump administration in an attempt to maintain funding for that program and others that provide services to illegal immigrants. ImmDef has accused the Trump administration of \"playing games with children's rights and their safety\" and says the program is needed to \"protect due process\" rights for illegal immigrants facing deportation.\n\nBut ImmDef has gone far beyond merely providing legal services to illegal immigrants facing deportation. The group, founded in 2015, has called for the government to \"dismantle the systems that seek to deport our clients.\" During the height of the Black Lives Matter movement, ImmDef called for dismantling \"the police state by defunding and decreasing police budgets.\"\n\nImmDef says it is \"high time we abolish the immigration prison system and abolish ICE\" and sold \"Abolish ICE\" face masks during the height of the coronavirus pandemic. In September 2020, ImmDef circulated the since-debunked MSNBC report that a doctor at an ICE facility in Georgia performed unnecessary hysterectomies on female detainees. \"#AbolishICE,\" ImmDef wrote on a social media post at the time.\n\nAccording to former federal immigration judge Matt O'Brien, funding for groups like ImmDef highlights Democrats' efforts to \"funnel taxpayer funds into the coffers of these radical groups\" in support of an \"anti-borders agenda.\"\n\n\"It's a basic principle of American-style democracy that reasonable minds may differ on political issues. However, there is a huge difference between advocating a policy position and actively encouraging foreign nationals to break our laws,\" said O'Brien, the director of investigations at the Immigration Reform Law Institute.\n\nImmDef receives most of its federal funding through the Acacia Center for Justice, a nonprofit that oversees a $769 million federal contract to house and counsel unaccompanied children. Acacia Center paid $17 million to ImmDef last year for contracts approved by the Department of Interior and Department of Justice to provide legal representation to minors who came to the United States without their parents.\n\nLike ImmDef, Acacia Center has called for an end to the detention of illegal immigrants and a pause on nearly all deportations. Acacia Center has alleged that the immigration system is \"intentionally designed\" to exploit \"Black and brown people.\" It opposes the use of police officers for \"immigration purposes\" and says that \"no immigrant should be detained,\" the Washington Free Beacon reported .\n\nAccording to O'Brien, the Biden administration engaged in a \"deliberate attempt\" to fill federal agencies such as the Department of Justice and Department of Homeland Security with officials \"willing to ignore America's immigration laws on purely ideological grounds.\"\n\n\"Those kinds of actions undermine both the rule of law and the will of the American electorate,\" O'Brien told the Free Beacon .\n\nImmDef and the Department of Justice did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nPublished under: #DefundThePolice , Abolish ICE , Acacia Center , Biden Administration , Defund the Police , Department of Justice , ICE , Illegal Immigration , Justice Department , Trump Administration\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "'No Immigrant Should Be Detained,' Says Left-Wing Nonprofit With $769 Million Federal Immigration Contract\n\nA left-wing group that serves as the lead contractor for a massive federal immigration contract claims the immigration system is \"intentionally designed\" to exploit \"Black and brown people,\" opposes the use of police officers for \"immigration purposes,\" and says \"no immigrant should be detained.\"\n\nAcacia Center for Justice, based in Washington, D.C., is one of the largest federal immigration contractors, overseeing a $769 million program that provides lawyers for unaccompanied alien children and adults in immigration court hearings and deportation proceedings.\n\nThe group says its aim is to provide due process rights for illegal aliens. But it also calls for a radical upheaval of the immigration and deportation system-goals that are starkly at odds with the Trump administration's objectives.\n\nLaunched in 2022, Acacia Center argues that \"no immigrant should be detained\" and that electronic surveillance to track illegal aliens \"must be abolished.\" According to the center, \"the use of local law enforcement for immigration purposes ... must be dismantled.\"\n\nIt maintains that the immigration detention and deportation system is \"intentionally designed to exploit, exclude, criminalize, detain and deport\" people deemed to be \"undeserving of inclusion in our national fabric, particularly Black and brown people.\"\n\nThat puts it squarely at odds with the Trump administration, which has pledged to increase deportations of illegal aliens dramatically. The administration has threatened to pull federal funds from sanctuary cities and states that prohibit local law enforcement from cooperating with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. Trump has ordered federal agencies to shut down the kinds of diversity, equity, and inclusion policies pushed by the Acacia Center.\n\nIn a report last June, Acacia Center recommended that the Executive Office for Immigration Review, the Department of Justice subagency that handles immigration cases, implement \"gender affirming language in immigration court.\" Acacia Center demanded that immigration lawyers and judges use correct pronouns for illegal aliens and said that \"repeated conduct that fails to affirm gender identity for noncitizens\" is a violation of federal anti-discrimination laws.\n\n\"It would be absurd for the government to continue funding a soft-on-crime, open borders activist group that has openly stated its intention to work against the incoming administration,\" said Parker Thayer, a senior analyst at the Capital Research Center, a watchdog group that launched the DOGE Files, a project to identify wasteful federal spending.\n\nThe administration froze funding for some of Acacia Center's programs as part of a broad spending freeze across most federal agencies. According to Acacia Center, the freeze affected four programs, though not its larger contract that provides legal services for unaccompanied alien children.\n\n\"The Acacia Center for Justice is committed to upholding the U.S. Constitution's demand for due process for everyone in the United States, which includes immigrants and children who arrive in our nation alone. Programs that ensure due process, like the ones Acacia administers, are critical for upholding these protections and make the immigration court system more efficient,\" Mike Corradini, Acacia's deputy chief of programs, told the Washington Free Beacon .\n\n\"We are ready to work with the Department of Justice to review and rapidly restore these essential services so that Acacia and our partners in the legal field can continue to deliver on the promise of justice for all,\" said Corradini.\n\nBut its statements about federal immigration policy-and Trump-could put that funding in jeopardy.\n\n\"No election result will erase the diversity and strength of our multicultural origins,\" Acacia executive director Shaina Aber said in a statement on Nov. 6. \"Whatever comes, our partners will fight to ensure due process protections are not jettisoned in favor of politically motivated scapegoating.\"\n\nAcacia Center is a spinoff of the Vera Institute of Justice, a Brooklyn-based nonprofit that has called to defund police departments and abolish immigration enforcement agencies. Acacia took over the unaccompanied children program from Vera Institute in December 2023. Acacia hired many of the Vera Institute staff members to continue working on the unaccompanied alien children program, the group said in a 2023 press release .\n\nThough Vera Institute no longer receives federal dollars for immigration contracts, it was awarded millions of dollars in Biden administration grants last year for criminal justice issues.  Last year, the Department of Justice awarded Vera Institute $2 million to develop \"municipal safety hubs,\" an alternative to using traditional police forces to address \"disturbances\" and \"survival behaviors,\" such as \"public disturbances ... public intoxication, and trespassing.\" Vera Institute has called to \"radically dismantle\" the policing system, the Washington Free Beacon reported .\n\nPublished under: Crime , Democrats , Donald Trump , Illegal Immigration , Immigration\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

The account will be led by John Martens, a former aide to several current and former House Republicans, according to lobbying records filed with Congress.\n\nIt comes as the Acacia Center aims to fend off spending freezes to organizations that handle immigration issues. The Department of Justice has awarded contracts to the Acacia Center to provide legal services to adults and children facing deportation proceedings. The center is also the lead contractor on a $769 million Health and Human Services contract to provide services to unaccompanied alien children detained at the border.\n\nThe Department of Justice under Trump froze funding for some of Acacia's contracts last month, but the organization said Monday the funding had been restored after a federal judge issued a temporary restraining order on Trump's spending freeze.\n\nBut its funding could still be in limbo because of the Trump administration's plans to use its \"Department of Government Efficiency\" to cut government waste. The Acacia Center's criticism of U.S. immigration policy and of Trump's immigration proposals could also put it in the administration's crosshairs.\n\nThe Acacia Center, which formed in 2022, argues that \"no immigrant should be detained\" and that electronic surveillance to track illegal aliens \"must be abolished,\" the Washington Free Beacon reported . According to the center, \"the use of local law enforcement for immigration purposes\" must be \"dismantled.\"\n\nThe group says the immigration and deportation system is \"intentionally designed to exploit, exclude, criminalize, detain, and deport\" people deemed to be \"undeserving of inclusion in our national fabric, particularly Black and brown people.\"\n\nThe Acacia Center has also called for stiff penalties against attorneys and judges who \"misgender\" illegal aliens during immigration proceedings held by the EOIR.\n\nThe center, which has received around $45 million in contracts from the EOIR, asserted in a report last year that repeated failures to \"affirm gender identity for noncitizens\" constitutes a violation of federal anti-discrimination laws.\n\nThe group said immigration judges should be allowed to discipline attorneys for their \"deliberate failure to use a respondent's or counsel's correct name and pronouns\" by rejecting their court filings or referring them for investigation by the Justice Department's Attorney Discipline Program.\n\nNumerous other liberal groups have hired Republican lobbyists to help navigate the Trump administration. Harvard University hired Ballard Partners, the former lobbying firm of White House chief of staff Susie Wiles. Columbia University hired Trump-linked lobbyists at BGR Government Affairs. Trump has threatened to hike tax rates on university endowments, and congressional Republicans have aggressively investigated the Ivy League schools and other universities for allowing anti-Semitic activity to run rampant on their campuses.\n\nThe Acacia Center for Justice and Federal Science Partners did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nPublished under: Department of Justice , Government Spending , Illegal Immigration , Immigration , Justice Department , Lobbying , Lobbyists\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "Senate Immigration Deal Would Allow Nearly 2 Million Illegal Border Crossings, Documents Show\n\nSenate negotiators on Wednesday reached a preliminary agreement on a border security bill that would dramatically raise the cap on foreign visas and allow more than 1.8 million illegal crossings a year, a summary of the provisions obtained by the Washington Free Beacon shows.\n\nThe draft bill is an effort to please immigration hardliners and progressive Democrats who want to preserve the Biden administration's border policies, which have facilitated a record number of illegal crossings. The bill, the result of negotiations between Sens. James Lankford (R., Okla.), Chris Murphy (D., Conn.), and Kyrsten Sinema (I., Ariz.), would also raise the annual number of visas issued, and trigger automatic migrant deportations once the total number of illegal border crossings exceeds 2 million annually.\n\nThe latter provision is an effort to appease conservatives, who slammed the Biden administration for suspending Trump-era deportation policies. But critics of the deal who spoke with the Free Beacon say the provision is worthless, since deportations would only resume if the border saw more than 5,000 illegal crossings per day. These individuals, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, also objected to the proposed issuance of an additional 50,000 immigrant visas annually.\n\nThere is little chance the agreement reaches President Joe Biden's desk as written. House Republican leadership is unified in its opposition to the bill, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) suggested on Wednesday that there may be no path forward for the legislation, citing pushback from former president Donald Trump.\n\n\"It's been obvious for weeks that the votes for this deal simply do not exist in the House, now we're learning it's even worse than expected,\" a Republican strategist told the Free Beacon . \"House Republicans already passed a border bill, Senate negotiators should tell Democrats they can take it or leave it.\"\n\nProponents of the bill point to provisions taken from H.R. 2, the House Republican immigration reform law that passed the lower chamber last year. Those include limits to presidential parole authority, by which the White House can let otherwise ineligible illegal aliens remain in the United States. The bill would also implement new standards for migrants seeking asylum, which supporters say would enable authorities to deport 75 percent of all illegal crossers.\n\nStill, without more concessions to the right-for instance, restricting federal funding of nonprofits House Republicans say facilitate illegal immigration-the bill could die in the Senate. Such an outcome would imperil military aid to Ukraine, which both the White House and the Senate mean to pair with immigration reform.\n\nSpeaking Wednesday evening, McConnell suggested that the Senate may need to decouple the issues, as \"the politics on this has changed.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson (R., La.) has repeatedly said he will not consider a Ukraine aid bill until Congress increases border security. Johnson's conservative colleagues have threatened to oust him should he move on Ukraine before reaching a border deal.\n\n\"Before we even talk about Ukraine, I'm going to tell the president [what] I'm telling all of you, and we've told the American people: border, border, border,\" Johnson said earlier this month. \"We have to take care of our own house. We have to secure our own border before we talk about doing anything else.\"\n\nImmigration authorities have recorded more than 6.3 million illegal border crossings since Biden took office. More than two million of those have been released into the United States.\n\nPublished under: Border Crisis , Chris Coons , Deportation , Illegal Immigration , Kyrsten Sinema , Mike Johnson , Mitch McConnell\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

Acacia Center is the lead contractor on a $769 million contract to provide the services.\n\nThe agency did not provide a specific reason for the stop work order. But the Trump administration has waged a broad effort through the Department of Government Efficiency, the quasi-agency led by Elon Musk, to cut wasteful federal spending. DOGE has set its sights on spending for DEI programs and other progressive initiatives.\n\nWhile Acacia Center says its federal programs help illegal aliens navigate the complex immigration and deportation process, it also pushes activist rhetoric about the immigration system, the Washington Free Beacon reported this month.\n\nAcacia Center, launched in 2022, argues that \"no immigrant should be detained,\" that the use of ankle monitors to track illegal aliens \"must be abolished,\" and that the use of local law enforcement to carry out immigration enforcement \"must be dismantled.\"\n\nAcacia Center says the immigration detention and deportation system is \"intentionally designed to exploit, exclude, criminalize, detain, and deport\" people deemed to be \"undeserving of inclusion in our national fabric, particularly Black and brown people.\"\n\nIn a report last year, Acacia Center recommended that attorneys and judges who appear in the Executive Office for Immigration Review, the agency that handles immigration cases, should face disciplinary action if they fail to \"affirm gender identity for noncitizens\" during court proceedings.\n\nThe center relies on dozens of subcontractors for its legal programs, many of which oppose Trump's immigration and deportation policies.\n\nAcacia Center has given nearly $6 million to the Amica Center for Immigrant Rights, formerly known as the Capital Area Immigrants' Rights Coalition, to serve as a subcontractor. Amica Center, which spun off from the Acacia Center in 2023, has sued the Department of Justice over its pause to several federal grants programs to provide legal services to illegal aliens. But while Amica Center claims in the lawsuit that the funding freeze will force it to lay off staff, the group is also running Facebook ads calling to \"dismantle Trump's deportation machine,\" the Free Beacon reported .\n\nAcacia Center says it provides legal representation through the federal program to 26,000 unaccompanied alien children, including many who have been trafficked or exploited.\n\n\"The administration's decision to suspend this program undermines due process, disproportionately impacts vulnerable children, and puts children who have already experienced severe trauma at risk for further harm or exploitation,\" said Acacia Center executive director Shaina Aber.\n\nThe Department of the Interior did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nPublished under: Acacia Center , Deficit , DEI , Department of the Interior , DOGE , Donald Trump , Elon Musk\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "Faced With Record Illegal Immigration, the White House Wants To Expedite Border Crossings\n\nAs illegal border crossings reach record highs, the Biden administration is considering a novel idea: make it even easier for migrants to enter the country.\n\nA senior official familiar with the plan told the Washington Free Beacon that the Department of Homeland Security wants to dispatch Customs and Border Protection agents to areas of Mexico that have seen large influxes of migrants. There, documents obtained by the Free Beacon show, law enforcement would begin the screening process for migrants and expedite their final journey across the southern border.\n\nSuch a program is virtually unprecedented, and represents an escalation of what critics call the Biden administration's facilitation of illegal immigration.\n\n\"What the Department of Homeland Security wants to do is send customs officers to Mexico so we can pre-clear surges of migrants ostensibly in hopes they stop crossing illegally,\" the DHS official told the Free Beacon . \"They would be doing background vetting so migrants can be waved through.\"\n\nBut the plan could put further strain on Border Patrol, which already faces a staffing shortage ahead of an expected winter surge. Staff who spoke with the Free Beacon said miles of the southern border have gone unguarded because agents have been relegated to processing migrants.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has overseen the largest immigration crisis in U.S. history, with law enforcement recording more than five million illegal crossings on the southern border since he took office. Blue state governors say the record number of migrants coming to their cities is straining their welfare systems, and cities including New York and Chicago are considering budget cuts to offset the cost of housing and feeding migrants.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security declined to comment.\n\nThere is ample evidence the Biden administration is well aware of large groups of migrants heading to the United States well before they reach the southern border. Since September, the Free Beacon reported , senior Department of Homeland Security officials have been in communication with Mexican immigration authorities over large caravans traveling to the United States but have seemingly done little to prepare.\n\nBiden has implemented measures he says will create a more orderly immigration system , such as a program that would allow migrants to apply for asylum remotely. Biden claimed the program would \"make things better but will not fix the border problem completely,\" while Republicans say it is illegal.\n\nThe program has not led to a decrease in border crossings. The 2023 fiscal year, which ended in October, saw 2.47 million migrant encounters on the southern border-the most in U.S. history.\n\nThe proposal to pre-screen migrants comes as the Senate negotiates a border security plan, which Democrats have bundled with a plan to provide military aid for Ukraine and Israel. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R., La.) has insisted that any Ukraine aid bill must include the Secure the Border Act, which would cap the number of people who can claim asylum, as well as fund the construction of a border wall.\n\nAs Biden has faced bipartisan criticism over his handling of the southern border, he has attempted to place blame on Republicans. His reelection campaign called former president Donald Trump, who leads the Republican field for the 2024 presidential nomination, \"extreme\" and \"racist\" on the issue.\n\nA Biden spokesman told Politico last month that another Trump term would bring \"mass detention camps [and] attempts to deny children born here citizenship.\"\n\nThat message has not appeared to resonate with voters. An NBC News poll released earlier this month found Republicans had an 18-point lead over Democrats on the issue of immigration.\n\nPublished under: Border Crisis , Customs and Border Protection , Department of Homeland Security , Illegal Immigration , Immigration , Joe Biden\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"
