(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - With Donald Trump's return to the White House only days away, Kamala Harris ' staff packed into her ceremonial office to watch her sign the desk, a tradition performed by her predecessors for decades. Her husband, Doug Emhoff, stood behind her to take a photo as she wielded her Sharpie marker.\n\n\"It is not my nature to go quietly into the night,\" Harris said Thursday. \"So don't worry about that.\"\n\nBut what is next for her?\n\n\"I'll keep you posted,\" she said.\n\nHarris hasn't made any plans for after leaving office Monday, apart from flying home to California. It will be the first time since 2004, when she became San Francisco's district attorney, that she hasn't held elected office.\n\nThere's talk that she'll write a book and speculation that she could run for governor or maybe president again. At 60 years old, Harris is still young in a political world where the last two presidents have set records as the oldest ever elected.\n\nDonna Brazile, a longtime leader in the Democratic Party, recalled telling Harris that she needs to take a break and \"learn what it's like to oversleep\" for a while. They both laughed, and Brazile said, \"Yeah, you'll never go back to being ordinary.\"\n\nBrazile was campaign manager for Al Gore, the last sitting vice president to run for the top job.\n\n\"I've had more people call me about what's next for Kamala Harris than called me about what's next for Al Gore,\" she said.\n\nHarris' term was both ordinary and extraordinary. Like many of her predecessors, she spent her time tending to a portfolio of issues - migration , abortion rights and maternal health among them - and representing the country overseas. Sometimes she struggled to distinguish herself , a common challenge in a job that comes with little constitutional responsibility.\n\nBut Harris also made history as the first woman, Black person or person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president. And last year, Harris was thrust into an unprecedented situation when President Joe Biden ended his reelection bid and endorsed her as his successor.\n\nThere were only 107 days left in the campaign, leaving Harris in a sprint for the presidency. She instantly reset the terms of the race against Trump, who is nearly two decades older than her, but was unable to defeat him.\n\nMany Democrats blamed Biden for running in the first place and putting Harris in an impossible position. Harris faced her own criticism, too.\n\nSome said she should have sent a more populist message instead of focusing on Trump's antidemocratic threats by campaigning with Liz Cheney , a former Republican congresswoman. She also failed to separate herself from Biden , who remains deeply unpopular with voters.\n\nMinyon Moore, who chaired last year's Democratic National Convention, downplayed the criticisms by saying \"ifa, woulda, coulda, shoulda.\"\n\nWith Harris facing such an unusual campaign, Moore said, \"there was no road map for what she should have done.\"\n\nHarris hasn't answered questions about her loss, nor has she shared her own perspective on the election. Her public remarks have been limited to rallying cries for students and others who are disappointed by Trump's victory, especially after Democrats described him as an existential threat to the country.\n\n\"No one can walk away,\" Harris said in one speech. \"We must stay in the fight. Every one of us.\"\n\nHarris hoped to close out her term with an around-the-world trip to Singapore, Bahrain and Germany, a final opportunity to showcase her role on foreign policy. But she decided to stay in Washington as wildfires spread around Los Angeles. Her own house, in the Brentwood neighborhood, has been in an evacuation zone.\n\nHarris didn't travel to the area because she was concerned about diverting local resources from responding to the fire, according to an official in her office who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss her planning.\n\nDespite canceling her overseas trip, Harris has signaled her interest in remaining involved on the global stage. She's spent time in her final week in office making calls to foreign leaders including King Abdullah II of Jordan, Israeli President Isaac Herzog, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Guatemalan President Bernardo Arévalo.\n\nOn Wednesday, she was in the Oval Office to watch Biden give his farewell address. He described her as \"a great partner,\" and they embraced after the speech.\n\nBiden chose Harris as his running mate after her first presidential campaign stalled four years ago. After taking office, her schedule was limited by the coronavirus pandemic and her obligations on Capitol Hill. With the U.S. Senate evenly divided, she was often called on to cast tiebreaking votes, eventually setting a record as she helped advance judicial nominees and landmark legislation.\n\n\"She had to find her role,\" said Joel Goldstein, a historian who has studied the vice presidency. \"It took some time to figure it out.\"\n\nMoore remembered an Oval Office meeting with Harris and other senior advisers as Biden deliberated whom to nominate for the U.S. Supreme Court. Although it was unlikely that a liberal justice would have many opportunities to write majority opinions on a court dominated by conservatives, Moore said Harris focused on which candidate would harness the platform to issue dissenting opinions.\n\nHarris wanted \"somebody who could think through the nuances of writing those dissensions,\" Moore said. Biden nominated Ketanji Brown Jackson , fulfilling his promise to put a Black woman on the bench, and she's often drawn attention for her sharp dissenting opinions.\n\nOne of Harris' original tasks, reducing migration from Central America, became a political burden. Republicans described her as the \"border czar\" and blamed her for illegal crossings. However, fewer migrants came from the countries where Harris focused her efforts.\n\nShe met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Munich shortly before the Russian invasion began three years ago, and she spent a week in Africa to lay the groundwork for renewed U.S. engagement.\n\nHarris also traveled three times to Southeast Asia as the administration tried to reorient foreign policy to confront China's influence.\n\n\"She had the perception that we could use even more of an emphasis on this occasionally overlooked part of the world,\" said Phil Gordon, Harris' national security adviser.\n\nAbortion rights became a defining issue for Harris after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Biden was more hesitant on the topic, and Harris started headlining the White House's efforts.\n\nLorraine Voles, Harris' chief of staff, said the court decision was \"a turning point\" for the vice president.\n\n\"That opened up a lane for her in a way that maybe wasn't there previously,\" she said. \"People were not focused on the issue of maternal health and reproductive health until people began to see it threatened.\"\n\nNadia Brown, a Georgetown University government professor who focuses on Black women and politics, said Harris will \"certainly go down in the history books\" for breaking down racial and gender barriers in politics.\n\nShe said Harris' time as vice president helped expand the views of \"everyday Americans who might have misconceptions about what a leader could be or should be.\"\n\nThe only question left is what Harris decides to do now.\n\n\"It's not over,\" Brown said. \"But I'm not sure what that next chapter is.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Susan Walsh)\n\nFollow AP's coverage of Donald Trump's transition back to the White House.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Faced with a sweeping rejection by American voters, Kamala Harris conceded the presidential election to Donald Trump on Wednesday and encouraged supporters to continue fighting for their vision of the country.\n\nThe Democratic vice president said the battle would continue \"in the voting booth, in the courts and in the public square.\"\n\n\"Sometimes the fight takes a while,\" she said at Howard University, her alma mater, where she had hoped to make a victory speech after the election. \"That doesn't mean we won't win.\"\n\nHarris' decisive defeat shattered hopes that she could rescue Democrats' chances after President Joe Biden's reelection effort stalled and she replaced him at the top of the ticket.\n\nShe trailed in every battleground state to Trump, a Republican whom she described as an existential danger to the country's foundational institutions. And Trump appeared on track to win the popular vote for the first time in his three campaigns for the White House - even after two impeachments, felony convictions and his attempt to overturn his previous election loss.\n\nDespite her stark warnings about Trump, Harris reached for optimism on Wednesday.\n\n\"It is OK to feel sad and disappointed, but please know it's going to be OK,\" she told supporters as some of them wiped tears from their eyes.\n\nBiden released a statement praising Harris after her speech, saying: \"She will continue the fight with purpose, determination, and joy. She will continue to be a champion for all Americans. Above all, she will continue to be a leader our children will look up to for generations to come as she puts her stamp on America's future.\"\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Harris' running mate, was in the audience with his family. So were Reps. Nancy Pelosi, the former House speaker, and Barbara Lee, both from Harris' home state of California.\n\nWhat to know about the 2024 election:\n\nNews outlets globally count on the AP for accurate U.S. election results. Since 1848, the AP has been calling races up and down the ballot. Support us. Donate to the AP .\n\nBefore her speech, Harris called Trump to congratulate him on his victory. She told the crowd that \"we will engage in a peaceful transfer of power,\" an implicit reference to Trump's unwillingness to do the same four years ago.\n\nSome in the audience expressed disappointment that Harris was not able to make history as the country's first Black female president. Harris would also have been first U.S. president of South Asian descent\n\nGregory Pate, 38, said he appreciated that Harris said she was \"committed to the fight and not looking at this as a permanent defeat, but just another obstacle that we have to go through as Black people.\"\n\n\"I think it was perfect. I think that it was timely, and it was a message that I came to hear,\" said Pate, of Fairfax, Virginia.\n\nDemocratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris, left, speaks with Ike Irby, senior advisor to the vice president, and Kirsten Allen, communications director to the vice president, shortly before taking the stage for Harris' final campaign rally, Monday, Nov. 4, 2024, in Philadelphia. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nJay Evans, of Greenbelt, Maryland, said after Harris' spoke that he's wistful for what could have been.\n\n\"We're partly sad, because hearing her speak, she would have been an amazing person to bring the country together and to keep us in a better path,\" Evans said.\n\nAfter Trump lost to Biden, he directed his supporters to march on the U.S. Capitol, leading to a violent insurrection that interrupted the ceremonial certification of the election results.\n\nNow Harris is expected to oversee the same certification process to finalize Trump's victory as voters brush off concerns about the future of American democracy and return the former Republican president to the White House.\n\nBiden plans to address the election results on Thursday. The White House said he spoke with Harris and Trump on Wednesday, and he invited the president-elect to meet with him soon.\n\nDavid Plouffe, a top Harris adviser, said campaign staffers \"left it all on the field for their country.\"\n\n\"We dug out of a deep hole but not enough,\" he said. \"A devastating loss.\"\n\nHarris became the Democratic candidate after Biden, who was already struggling to convince voters that he could serve as president until he was 86 years old, stumbled badly in his June 27 debate with Trump.\n\nHe dropped out of the race on July 21 and endorsed his vice president, who swiftly unified the Democratic Party around her candidacy.\n\nIt was a remarkable twist of fate for Harris. Four years earlier, her own presidential campaign had flamed out and revealed the political limitations of someone once dubbed \"the female Barack Obama.\" Even though Biden chose Harris as his running mate, she languished in the role after taking office as the first woman, Black person or person of South Asian descent to serve as vice president.\n\nSome Democrats started writing her off when they pondered the party's future after Biden. But Harris found fresh purpose after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, and she became the White House's leading advocate for abortion rights.\n\nHarris also made a more concerted effort to network with local politicians, business leaders and cultural figures, forging connections that could serve her down the road. The moment arrived sooner than she anticipated, and she was catapulted into the presidential race with Biden's departure only a month before the Democratic National Convention.\n\nHarris instantly reset the terms of the contest with Trump. She was 18 years younger and a former courtroom prosecutor going up against the first major presidential candidate convicted of crimes. Her candidacy energized Democrats who feared they were destined for defeat with Biden at the top of the ticket.\n\nBut she also faced steep odds from the beginning. She inherited Biden's political operation with just 107 days until the end of the election, and she faced a restless electorate that was eager for change.\n\nAlthough Harris pitched \"a new way forward,\" she struggled to meaningfully differentiate herself from the unpopular sitting president. In addition, she had limited time to introduce herself to skeptical voters, who never cast a ballot for her in a presidential primary.\n\nDemocrats now face the prospect of picking up the pieces during a second Trump presidency, and it's unclear what role Harris will play in her party's future.\n\n\"The work of protecting America from the impacts of a Trump Presidency starts now,\" wrote Jen O'Malley Dillon, Harris' campaign chair, in a letter to staff. \"I know the Vice President isn't finished in this fight, and I know the very people on this email are also going to be leaders in this collective mission.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Kamala Harris on Tuesday urged anyone who is disappointed by her defeat in last month's election to \"stay in the fight\" as Donald Trump prepares to take office, hinting that she won't be stepping off the political stage anytime soon.\n\nThe vice president's remarks to students in the Maryland Corps service year program were her most extensive since her concession speech . She did not disclose her own plans for after her term ends, but she spoke about \"our shared commitment to the work ahead.\"\n\nThe speech was something of a pep talk as Trump returns to the White House and Republicans take full control of Congress, a devastating result for Democrats.\n\n\"Many people have come up to me, telling me they feel tired, maybe even resigned,\" Harris said. \"Folks have said to me that they're not sure whether they have the strength, much less the desire, to stay in the fight. But let me be very clear. No one can walk away. We must stay in the fight. Every one of us.\"\n\nAt 60 years old, Harris likely has another act or two in public life, maybe even another run for the presidency. But she could face stiff competition from other Democratic politicians and weariness from voters who want to move on after a dispiriting campaign ended with Trump's victory.\n\n\"The true test of our character is how resilient and persistent we are to pursue the future that we all can see,\" she said.\n\nHarris did not mention Trump in her speech, but the remarks could serve as a first step toward positioning herself as a leader of the political opposition. There's also speculation that she could run for governor in her home state of California, where the next election is in 2026.\n\nDemocrats are still trying to figure out the best way forward for their party. Judging by her speech, Harris envisions a path that's very similar to the message from her candidacy and vice presidency, and she echoed many of the same themes on Tuesday.\n\nWhile serving under President Joe Biden , Harris toured college campuses and focused on issues that resonate with students, like gun violence and climate change. She also made sure to meet with young people overseas in Africa and Asia as she worked on U.S. diplomatic efforts.\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, Harris often talked about her love of Generation Z and the importance of rising leaders. It was one of the ways she tried to draw a contrast with Trump, who is 78 years old.\n\nHowever, Harris did worse with young people this year than Biden did four years ago. According to AP VoteCast , a survey of the electorate, she won 51% of voters ages 18 to 29, down from 61% for Biden.\n\nHarris told her audience on Tuesday that they should enjoy the holidays. But, she said, \"I challenge you to come back ready, ready to chart our path to the future. Chin up, shoulders back, forever impatient for change.\"\n\nIn addition, she started her speech by expressing concerns about gun violence after a school shooting in Madison, Wisconsin, on Monday.\n\n\"Solutions are in hand,\" she said. \"But we need elected leaders to have the courage to step up and do the right thing.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(Thomas Slusser/The Tribune-Democrat via AP)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Kamala Harris stood before an overflowing crowd near the White House on Tuesday and promised Americans she would fight for them every day as she urged voters to reject Donald Trump's efforts to sow division and fear, declaring, \"It doesn't have to be this way.\"\n\nOne week out from Election Day , the vice president tried to drive home the contrast with Trump by delivering her closing argument from the same spot on the grassy Ellipse where the Republican former president had fomented the Capitol insurrection in 2021, pledging that she would work to improve people's lives while arguing that her Republican opponent is only in it for himself.\n\n\"I'll be honest with you: I'm not perfect,\" she said. \"I make mistakes. But here's what I promise you: I will always listen to you, even if you don't vote for me. I will always tell you the truth, even if it's hard to hear. I will work every day to build consensus and reach compromise to get things done. And if you give me the chance to fight on your behalf, there is nothing in the world that will stand in my way.\"\n\nHarris began her capstone speech by reminding voters of Trump's role in the chaos of Jan. 6, 2021 , when he spewed falsehoods about the 2020 presidential election that inspired a crowd to march to the Capitol and try unsuccessfully to halt the certification of Democrat Joe Biden's victory. She brought up his threats to use the military against his political rivals and his labeling of those who disagree with him as \"the enemy from within.\"\n\n\"Look, we know who Donald Trump is. He is the person who stood at this very spot nearly four years ago and sent an armed mob to the United States Capitol to overturn the will of the people in a free and fair election,\" she said. Trump, she added, \"has spent a decade trying to keep the American people divided and afraid of each other.\"\n\n\"This is not a candidate for president who is thinking about how to make your life better,\" she said, branding Trump a \"petty tyrant\" and \"wannabe dictator.\"\n\nHarris continued: \"But America, I am here tonight to say: That's not who we are.\" She added, \"It doesn't have to be this way.\"\n\nHarris sought to use her largest remaining stage before polls close to make a broader case for why voters should reject Trump and consider what she offers, while still introducing herself to voters clamoring for more information.\n\nThe White House gleaming behind her, Harris encouraged the crowd to visualize their divergent futures depending on who wins on Election Day.\n\n\"In less than 90 days, either Donald Trump or I will be in the Oval Office,\" she said. \"On Day One, if elected, Donald Trump would walk into that office with an enemies list. When elected, I will walk in with a to-do list.\"\n\nHarris went on to list key policy goals, including expanding Medicare coverage of home health care, boosting the supply of housing in the country and working to restore nationwide access to abortion.\n\nHer speech drew a massive crowd to Washington, with supporters spilling out toward the Washington Monument on the National Mall. More critically, her campaign hopes the setting will help catch the attention of battleground state voters who remain on the fence about whom to vote for - or whether to vote at all.\n\nAhead of Harris' remarks, her campaign showcased a line-up of ordinary Americans who spoke about their dream and priorities, rather than showcasing the star power that has been featured at some recent Harris events. They included Amanda Zurawski, a woman who nearly died from sepsis after being denied care under Texas' strict abortion ban, Craig Sicknick, the brother of Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who died in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack, and a Pennsylvania husband and wife who previously vote for Trump but now back Harris.\n\nRuth Chiari, 78, of Charlottesville, Virginia, said she attended the rally with her husband to \"support democracy.\"\n\n\"I think everybody understands what's on the ballot,\" she said as she waited in line to enter the event. \"We're either going to have an autocrat or freedom.\"\n\nKathleen Nicholas, 36, a government relations worker in Washington, remembered Jan. 6 and loved the contrast of Tuesday's crowd and atmosphere with that day. \"I like she chose this place for her closing,\" she said. \"Having something that is a direct contrast to that day is what we needed.\"\n\nWith time running out and the race tight, Harris and Trump have both sought big moments to try to shift momentum their way.\n\nAP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani reports Kamala Harris will give her campaign's closing argument tonight from the same spot where Donald Trump rallied supporters before the Capitol riot.\n\nThe address came days after Harris traveled to Texas, a reliably Republican state, to appear with megastar Beyoncé and emphasize the consequences for women after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. That, too, was a speech meant to register with voters far away in the battleground states.\n\nThe vice president's latest address has been in the works for weeks. But aides hoped her message would land with more impact after Trump's rally Sunday at Madison Square Garden in New York, where speakers hurled cruel and racist insults.\n\n\"Unlike Donald Trump, I don't believe people who disagree with me are the enemy,\" Harris said. \"He wants to put them in jail. I'll give them a seat at my table. And I pledge to be a president for all Americans. To always put country above party and above self.\"\n\nAlso central to her message: positioning herself as a \"new generation\" of leader after Trump and even her current boss, President Joe Biden.\n\n\"It is time to stop pointing fingers and start locking arms,\" she said. \"It is time to turn the page on the drama and conflict, the fear and division. It is time for a new generation of leadership in America. And I am ready to offer that leadership as the next president of the United States.\"\n\nShe acknowledged that \"many of you are still getting to know who I am\" after her surprise elevation to the top of the Democratic ticket after Biden dropped out of the race in July, and used her remarks to try to answer voters' curiosity.\n\n\"I recognize this has not been a typical campaign,\" Harris said, adding that she is \"not afraid of tough fights against bad actors and powerful interests.\"\n\nAhead of Harris' speech, Trump used remarks to reporters at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida on Tuesday morning to accuse Harris of closing with a message that doesn't address everyday Americans' day-to-day struggles and kitchen-table concerns.\n\nHe said Harris keeps \"talking about Hitler, and Nazis, because her record's horrible,\" a reference to Harris amplifying the warnings from his former chief of staff that Trump spoke admiringly of the Nazi leader while in office.\n\nTrump press secretary Karoline Leavitt said, \"His closing argument to the American people is simple: Kamala broke it; he will fix it.\"\n\nBiden told reporters Tuesday that he would not attend Harris' speech because the event is \"for her,\" but he sparked a firestorm ahead of Harris' remarks. Reacting to a comic calling Puerto Rico garbage at a Trump rally last weekend , Biden said, \"The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters.\"\n\nWith Republicans amplifying his comments seemingly denigrating Trump supporters, Biden sought to clarify them in a post on X. \"Earlier today I referred to the hateful rhetoric about Puerto Rico spewed by Trump's supporter at his Madison Square Garden rally as garbage - which is the only word I can think of to describe it. His demonization of Latinos is unconscionable. That's all I meant to say. The comments at that rally don't reflect who we are as a nation.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Michelle L.

(Photo by Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) - Former Vice President Kamala Harris stepped on the NAACP Image Awards stage Saturday night with a sobering message, calling the civil rights organization a pillar of the Black community and urging people to stay resilient and hold onto their faith during the tenure of President Donald Trump .\n\n\"While we have no illusions about what we are up against in this chapter in our American story, this chapter will be written not simply by whoever occupies the oval office nor by the wealthiest among us,\" Harris said after receiving the NAACP's Chairman's Award. \"The American story will be written by you. Written by us. By we the people.\"\n\nThe 56th annual Image Awards was held at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium in the Los Angeles area.\n\nHarris, defeated by Trump in last year's presidential election, was the first woman and the first person of color to serve as vice president. She had previously been a U.S. senator from California and the state's attorney general.\n\nIn her first major public appearance since leaving office, Harris did not reference her election loss or Trump's actions since entering the Oval Office, although Trump mocked her earlier in the day at the Conservative Political Action Conference .\n\nHarris spoke about eternal vigilance, the price of liberty, staying alert, seeking the truth and America's future.\n\n\"Some see the flames on our horizons, the rising waters in our cities, the shadows gathering over our democracy and ask 'What do we do now?'\" Harris said. \"But we know exactly what to do, because we have done it before. And we will do it again. We use our power. We organize, mobilize. We educate. We advocate. Our power has never come from having an easy path.\"\n\nOther winners of the Chairman's prize have included former President Barack Obama , the late Rep. John Lewis and the late actor Ruby Dee .\n\nHarris was honored during the ceremony along with the Wayans family . The family was inducted into the NAACP Image Awards Hall of Fame in recognition of pioneering contributions to film, TV, sketch and stand-up comedy that have shaped Hollywood for decades.\n\nKeenen Ivory Wayans, Damon Wayans Sr., Marlon Wayans, Shawn Wayans, Kim Wayans and Damon Wayans Jr. each were recognized.\n\nMarlon Wayans, whose guest appearance on Peacock's \"Bel-Air\" was up for an NAACP award, shared how Keenen Ivory Wayans sparked the family's rise.\n\n\"He raised us all like Jedis,\" he said. \"We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for our big brother.\"\n\nMarlon Wayans joked that when his brother told their mom he was leaving college for comedy, she said, \"Boy, I've known you your whole life, and you ain't never said nothing funny. That's the funniest thing you've said.\"\n\nThe crowd erupted in laughter, a fitting tribute to a family that has kept audiences laughing for more than three decades.\n\nThe family has a long list of credits. Keenen Ivory Wayans created the sketch comedy series \"In Living Color\" in 1990 and directed the 2000 slasher spoof \"Scary Movie,\" which was written by Marlon Wayans and Shawn Wayans, who also wrote and starred in \"White Chicks\" in 2004. Damon Wayan's had a starring role in the 1995 comedy \"Major Payne,\" and currently co-stars with son Damon Wayans Jr. in the CBS sitcom \"Poppa's House,\" which was nominated for an NAACP Award. The pair also were nominated for their acting on the show.\n\nDamon Wayans Jr. has acted in two of the most critically acclaimed comedies in recent years: \"Happy Endings\" and \"New Girl.\" Kim Wayans, a comedian, actor and director, also received praise for her work in the 2011 drama \"Pariah.\"\n\nKeke Palmer expressed her surprise after her name was called as winner of the coveted entertainment of the year.\n\n\"Oh my gosh. Guys, I didn't think I was going to win,\" said Palmer, who paid homage to fellow nominee Cynthia Erivo's Oscar-nominated performance in \"Wicked.\"\n\nPalmer starred in the buddy comedy \"One of Them Days,\" which debuted No. 1 at the box office last month. She also won an Emmy for her hosting efforts on NBC's \"Password.\"\n\n\"It's such an amazing category to be in with all these people,\" Palmer said. \"It's a beautiful night. It's Black History Month, y'all. It's so important we all come here together and celebrate one another with one another.\"\n\nOther nominees included Kendrick Lamar, Kevin Hart and Shannon Sharpe.\n\nImage Awards host Deon Cole honored residents of the nearby Altadena neighborhood who were affected by January's devastating Los Angeles-area wildfires .\n\nA video of the fire devastation played before actor Morris Chestnut took the stage.\n\n\"Homes were lost, stores destroyed, countless lives shattered and over two dozens souls gone forever,\" said Chestnut, a Los Angeles native who referenced impacted areas such as Altadena, the Pacific Palisades and Malibu.\n\n\"But what was not lost is the spirit of our community,\" said Chestnut, who noted 22 Altadena residents attended the show on Saturday. Many in the audience stood and applauded.\n\nCole shifted tone and brightened the mood with a comedic prayer for Kanye West's wife to find more clothes after her barely-there Grammys look and for Shannon Sharpe to finally size up his T-shirts.\n\nThe opening act was a lead-up to the evening's first award: Queen Latifah as best actress in a drama series for her role in \"The Equalizer.\"\n\nDave Chappelle was honored with the President's Award for his \"thought-provoking humor.\"\n\nAccepting the award, Chappelle talked about the NAACP's push against negative portrayals of Black people in media and the importance of representation.\n\n\"Every opportunity we get, we just keep chipping away at this monster of a machine,\" he said.\n\nPast recipients of the President's Award include Jay-Z, Lauryn Hill, Usher, Rihanna and John Legend.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - Kamala Harris wanted to help voters get to know her better with a cascade of media appearances Tuesday, but the most lasting impression might have been her unwillingness to break with Joe Biden.\n\nAsked on ABC's \"The View\" how she would be different from the president she's served under for four years, Harris said \"we're obviously two different people\" and \"I will bring those sensibilities to how I lead.\"\n\nHowever, she was not able to identify a decision where she would have gone another way. \"There is not a thing that comes to mind,\" Harris said.\n\nThe exchange encapsulated Harris' struggle to portray herself as a candidate who can deliver the change voters crave while also remaining loyal to the current administration. Some Harris aides privately winced as gleeful Republicans swiftly circulated clips of her response and Donald Trump swiped at her in a social media post, calling it \"her dumbest answer so far.\"\n\nIt wasn't until later in the show that Harris named something that she would do differently than Biden - she would put a Republican in her Cabinet.\n\nThe Democratic nominee said she would welcome contributions from the other party \"because I don't feel burdened by letting pride get in the way of a good idea.\"\n\nThe interview was a reminder that friendly media venues - the women of \"The View\" were nearly rapturous in their embrace of Harris - can be as treacherous for politicians to navigate as hardball journalistic interrogations. And it came at a delicate moment for Harris, whose motorcade whisked her from studio to studio in New York on Tuesday.\n\nShe faced a similar question during a taping of CBS' \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, who asked Harris \"what would the major changes be\" from Biden. She offered nothing other than saying \"I'm obviously not Joe Biden, so that would be one change\" - then emphasized that she's also not Trump.\n\nEven though Harris' abbreviated and unexpected bid for the presidency is more than half over, she is still racing to introduce herself to voters who haven't made up their minds about her or whether to cast ballots in this year's election. Her interviews Tuesday, which included sitting down with radio host Howard Stern, were an attempt to reach as many people as possible with only four weeks to go until the end of the campaign. She also recently spoke to CBS' \"60 Minutes,\" which aired Monday night, and Alex Cooper's podcast \"Call Her Daddy,\" which was released Sunday.\n\nIt's a kaleidoscopic media blitz intended to reach key demographics, from men who are longtime fans of Stern to young women who follow Cooper's frank conversations about sex and relationships.\n\nHarris' decision to open up is a sharp shift after largely avoiding interviews since replacing Biden at the top of the ticket, and it's an acknowledgment that she needs to do more to defeat Trump.\n\nGetting personal has never been easy for Harris, a lawyer by training whose first job in public life was making opening and closing arguments as a courtroom prosecutor.\n\n\"It feels immodest to me to talk about myself,\" Harris said to Stern. \"A friend of mine actually said, 'Look, this is not a time to worry about modesty, because obviously you gotta let people know who you are.'\"\n\nBy the time she was finished with the interview, Harris had, by her standards, bared her soul. Some examples:\n\nShe ate a family sized bag of Doritos after Trump beat Hillary Clinton. She works out on an elliptical every day. Her first job was cleaning test tubes at her mother's laboratory, and she got fired. Her favorite Formula One driver is Lewis Hamilton. She went to see U2 at the Sphere in Las Vegas, and she recommends going with a \"clear head,\" meaning not high on drugs, because \"there's a lot of visual stimulation.\"\n\nHarris also said \"I literally lose sleep\" over the election because \"the stakes are so high.\"\n\nAnna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, said Harris has to energize people who have tuned out politics because they believe \"all the politicians are the same, they all say the same thing, they don't know anything about my life, I can't relate to them at all.\"\n\n\"They want to like and trust you,\" she said.\n\nAs if to drive the point home, Colbert's show included a very literal riff on the old political adage that Americans want politicians that they could have a beer with, and he pulled out two cans of Miller High Life.\n\nHarris took a sip and said the last time she had drunk beer was at a baseball game with her husband.\n\nJennifer Harris, the former White House senior director of international economics, said Harris has a steeper hill to climb because of the way she became the Democratic nominee.\n\n\"We did not have a good long primary to meet Kamala Harris in the way most voters are accustomed to,\" she said. Harris has to find a way to demonstrate the instincts and principles that \"will be guiding any number of hundreds of specific policy questions that will come up in the course of the presidency.\"\n\nHarris used her Tuesday appearance on \"The View\" to discuss her proposal to have Medicare cover in-home care for the elderly, helping to relieve the burden faced by an increasing number of families.\n\nShe spoke about taking care of her own mother when she was dying of cancer, including cooking for her and picking out soft clothing that wouldn't irritate her. And she criticized Trump as selfish and uninterested in helping Americans. If you watch his grievance-filled rallies, she said, \"he does not talk about what your parents need, what your children need.\"\n\nInstead, Harris said, \"he talks about his needs.\"\n\nIt was a moment that Harris' campaign would much rather get noticed than her answer about Biden. They believe that a small yet pivotal numbers of undecided voters want to know more about Harris before making up their minds, and that the more those voters see Harris, the more they like her.\n\nRepublican communications strategist Kevin Madden said defining Harris in voters' eyes is the central challenge of the campaign.\n\n\"This race is actually pretty simple in the sense that the next few weeks are about who's going to fill in the blanks on who Harris is,\" he said.\n\nHarris' name recognition grew when she became vice president, but 1 out of 10 people still said they didn't know enough about her to have an opinion, according to AP-NORC polling. Recent shifts in her favorability numbers suggest that views on Harris may still be somewhat malleable.\n\nOther polls have similar results. One-quarter of likely voters said they still feel like they need to learn more about Harris, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll conducted after her debate against Trump , while about three-quarters say they pretty much already know what they need to know about her.\n\nNear the end of Harris' interview on the \"Call Her Daddy\" podcast, Cooper confronted the vice president with one of the central questions of this campaign.\n\nSo many people, Cooper said, are \"frustrated and just exhausted with politics in general,\" so \"why should we trust you?\"\n\nHarris answered by saying \"you can look at my career to know what I care about.\"\n\n\"I care about making sure that people are entitled to and receive the freedoms that they are due,\" she said. \"I care about lifting people up and making sure that you are protected from harm.\"\n\n___\n\nMegerian reported from Washington.

(Erin Schaff/The New York Times via AP, Pool)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Vice President Kamala Harris has secured the support of enough Democratic delegates to become her party's nominee against Republican Donald Trump, according to an Associated Press survey , as top Democrats rallied to her in the aftermath of President Joe Biden's decision to drop his bid for reelection.\n\nThe quick coalescing behind Harris marked an attempt by the party to put weeks of internecine drama over Biden's political future behind them and to unify behind the task of defeating Trump with just over 100 days until Election Day. Prominent Democratic elected officials, party leaders and political organizations quickly lined up behind Harris in the day after Biden's exit from the race and her campaign set a new 24-hour record for presidential donations on Monday.\n\nSeveral state delegations met late Monday to confirm their support for Harris, including Texas and her home state of California. By Monday night, Harris had the support of well more than the 1,976 delegates she'll need to win on a first ballot, according to the AP tally. No other candidate was named by a delegate contacted by the AP.\n\nCalifornia state Democratic Chairman Rusty Hicks said 75% to 80% of the state's delegation were on a call Tuesday and they unanimously supported Harris.\n\n\"I've not heard anyone mentioning or calling for any other candidate,\" Hicks said. \"Tonight's vote was a momentous one.\"\n\nStill, the AP is not calling Harris the new presumptive nominee. That's because the convention delegates are still free to vote for the candidate of their choice at the convention in August or if Democrats go through with a virtual roll call ahead of that gathering in Chicago.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris speaks from the South Lawn of the White House in Washington, Monday, July 22, 2024, during an event with NCAA college athletes. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nHarris, in a statement, responded to the AP tally, saying she is \"grateful to President Biden and everyone in the Democratic Party who has already put their faith in me, and I look forward to taking our case directly to the American people.\"\n\nWorries over Biden's fitness for office were replaced by fresh signs of unity after a seismic shift to the presidential contest that upended both major political parties' carefully honed plans for the 2024 race.\n\nSpeaking to campaign staff in Wilmington, Delaware, Harris acknowledged the \"rollercoaster\" of the last several weeks, but expressed confidence in her new campaign team.\n\n\"It is my intention to go out and earn this nomination and to win,\" she said. She promised to \"unite our Democratic Party, to unite our nation, and to win this election.\"\n\nWhat to know about the 2024 election:\n\nNews outlets globally count on the AP for accurate U.S. election results. Since 1848, the AP has been calling races up and down the ballot. Support us. Donate to the AP .\n\nShe quickly leaned into the themes that will be prominent in her campaign against Trump over the coming 100 days, contrasting her time as a prosecutor with Trump's felony convictions - \"I know Donald Trump's type,\" she said - and casting herself as a defender of economic opportunity and abortion access.\n\n\"Our fight for the future is also a fight for freedoms,\" she said. \"The baton is in our hands.\"\n\nThe president called into the meeting from his home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, where he is recovering from COVID-19, to lend his support to Harris. He planned to talk about his decision to step aside in an address to the nation later this week.\n\n\"The name has changed at the top of the ticket, but the mission hasn't changed at all,\" Biden said in his first public remarks since announcing his decision to step aside, promising he was \"not going anywhere\" and plans to campaign on Harris' behalf.\n\nBiden said of his decision, \"It was the right thing to do.\"\n\nAs he handed off the mantle of leadership to Harris, Biden added: \"I'm watching you kid. I love you.\"\n\nHarris was headed to the battleground state of Wisconsin on Tuesday as her campaign for the White House kicks into high gear. The event in Milwaukee will be her first full-fledged campaign event since announcing her candidacy.\n\nThe AP tally is based on interviews with individual delegates, public statements from state parties, many of which have announced that their delegations are supporting Harris en masse, and public statements and endorsements from individual delegates.\n\nLocking up the nomination was only the first item on the staggering political to-do list for Harris after learning of Biden's plans to leave the race Sunday morning on a call with the president. She must also pick a running mate and pivot a massive political operation that had been built to reelect Biden to boost her candidacy instead.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, Biden's campaign formally changed its name to Harris for President, reflecting that she is inheriting his political operation of more than 1,000 staffers and war chest that stood at nearly $96 million at the end of June. She added $81 million to that total in the first 24 hours after Biden's endorsement, her campaign said - a presidential fundraising record - with contributions from more than 888,000 donors.\n\nThe campaign also saw a surge of interest after Harris took over, with more than 28,000 new volunteers registered since the announcement - a rate more than 100 times an average day from the previous Biden reelection campaign, underscoring the enthusiasm behind Harris.\n\nBig-name Harris endorsements Monday, including from Govs. Wes Moore of Maryland, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, J.B. Pritzker of Illinois and Andy Beshear of Kentucky, left a vanishing list of potential rivals.\n\nHouse Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, who had been one of the notable holdouts, initially encouraging a primary to strengthen the eventual nominee, said she was lending her \"enthusiastic support\" to Harris' effort to lead the party.\n\nHarris, if elected, would be the first woman and first person of South Asian descent to be president.\n\nThe Democratic National Convention is scheduled to be held Aug. 19-22 in Chicago, but the party had announced before Biden dropped out that it would hold a virtual roll call to formally nominate Biden before in-person proceedings begin. The convention's rules committee is scheduled to meet this week to finalize its nomination process with a virtual vote as soon as Aug. 1, the party announced on Monday, with the process completed by Aug. 7.\n\n\"We can and will be both fast and fair as we execute this nomination,\" Jaime Harrison, the Democratic National Committee's chair, said on a conference call with reporters.\n\nThe party said the virtual roll call would feature multiple rounds of voting on nominees if multiple candidates meet the qualification threshold. To qualify, candidates must have the electronic signatures of 300 convention delegates.\n\n-\n\nAP writers Seung Min Kim and Will Weissert in Washington and Chris Megerian in Wilmington, Delaware, contributed.\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of the 2024 election at https://apnews.com/hub/election-2024 .\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Kamala Harris Is Well-Suited for President-but Poorly Dressed\n\nIn experience and qualifications, Kamala Harris is more than ready to become the first female president of the United States. But amid the biggest political battle of her life, Harris has failed to leverage one of the most powerful communication tools for female leaders: her sense of style. There's no underlying strategy-a fashion scaffolding, so to speak-that undergirds her clothing choices and unifies them with her core values and political messaging to reach her target audiences.\n\nCase in point: In contrast to Harris' attire, her running mate, Tim Walz , has been lauded for his pointedly all-American, everyman attire-those wildly popular Harris/Walz camo baseball caps, for example. Citing his love for outdoors outfitter L.L. Bean and construction gear company Carhartt, among other folks brands, Guardian editor Betsy Reed recently asked, \" Can Tim Walz's wardrobe win the White House? \"\n\nFor much of her career as a prosecutor, senator, vice president, and now presidential candidate, Harris has been pragmatic and risk-averse in her sartorial choices, filling her wardrobe with the requisite staid pantsuits and dated \"pussy bow\" blouses. Maybe in part because of the time spent in musty courtrooms?\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBroadly speaking, these pantsuits are often poorly tailored; in color and style, they don't do justice to her flawless skin, delicate face, and petite figure. (Furthermore, her jackets are too long and almost always buttoned at the waist-the most unflattering place a button can be for most women.) \"Pantsuits do give an impression of power and authority,\" says Catherine Jackson, founder of image consulting firm PowerStyle and creator of the popular Instagram channel @thepowerstylist. \"But I find it a bit difficult to see her shape because of the suits that she wears... I feel that they swamp her slightly.\"\n\nYes, these fashion failings are generational-a product of workplaces and professional cultures that did not center (or even allow) femininity-or women. But as a South Indian immigrant of Harris's generation, I viscerally recognize the boxy padded pieces that the vice president has long embraced. To us immigrants in the '80s, the pantsuit was one of the first symbols of assimilation into the American workforce. The subtext: \"I can be like you. I am like you.\"\n\nIn some ways, Harris' attire feels like she is still fighting that age-old fight for assimilation, though she is of course an American-born citizen herself. What she needs to do is to acknowledge-even more, to thrive in the knowledge-that in some ways, she'll always be the outsider. Immigrants and other minorities almost always are.\n\nFor us immigrants-first and second generation-these social constraints are constantly in flux. As times change, so does the way we assimilate and observe the aesthetic practices of our new home countries; the American Dream is not a dream of days gone by, after all. Harris could-and should-proudly represent America's modern-day diaspora through subtle nods to her roots in her wardrobe.\n\nShe has a rich cultural heritage-from India and Jamaica-she could tap into: gorgeous fabrics in vibrant colors, for example, or intricate jewelry. Jackson believes Harris' preponderance of subdued suits in navy and other blues, while signaling trust and dependability, reads as uninspiring writ large . Instead, Harris would benefit from clothes and accessories with hints of green (to represent growth) or energizing jewel tones, like ruby red and shades of purple.\n\nFashion brands today are revolutionizing women's pantsuits for the modern-day executive with a focus on feminine tailoring (narrower pants cut to the ankle, for example), vibrant colors, textures, and accents. To break the ultimate gender barrier, Harris has to embrace these new norms to signal modernity, effortless confidence, and a willingness to be different-a sartorial symbol of the melting pot-born generation of Americans that she embodies.\n\nChitra Ragavan is an executive leadership coach and strategic adviser to CEOs and thought leaders.

That is, until her husband, Doug Emhoff poured cold water on the rumors by posting a photo of their \"watch party prep\" at home in sweats. Deadline reported that the losing 2024 presidential candidate will probably be at the event, although there was no indication of whether she would be presenting or not. The trade publication wrote that security around the Dolby Theatre was unusually high, effectively \"shutting down\" Hollywood. \"We live in a new evolving security environment,\" a federal official told Deadline on Sunday, right before the Oscars. \"The expected attendance of the former vice president is a major factor in the added security,\" another law enforcement officer told the publication. Another source for the ceremony told Deadline, however, that the rumors were untrue. But protection for the star-studded event included drones, police pre-screenings for press, and K-9 units on the scene to sniff out trouble. \"There are no credible threats,\" however, Deadline reported. Harris was seen in the photo scooping Doritos into a bowl-a nod to her quote during last year's presidential campaign about soothing herself after the 2016 election with an entire \"family-sized bag of nacho Doritos.\"\n\nOscars watch party prep. pic.twitter.com/vOU3D1jubQ\n\nBreaking News Intern\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Harris' Interview-Dodging Is All Part of the Plan-Apparently\n\nVice President Kamala Harris ' campaign is deliberately shutting out the press knowing it vexes reporters, sources close to the campaign told Axios .\n\nJournalists and press groups have lambasted the Harris-Walz campaign in recent weeks for restricting access and rarely making its candidates available, while the Republican ticket-especially vice presidential candidate JD Vance -has been much more open and accessible to media.\n\nAxios said the Harris team \"believes limiting interactions with the press is the right strategy,\" noting the negative coverage resulting from unscripted media appearances by their GOP rivals. One key example would be the slew of unforced errors by former president Donald Trump and Vance for spreading false rumors about migrants eating people's pets in Ohio.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe news site tallied up the number of print and television media interviews each presidential ticket has given since July 21: Vance, with 59 appearances, has been far and away the most accessible, followed by Trump with 14. Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz has given just four interviews, and Harris three. In that period, Harris and Walz also held a combined zero press conferences, while Vance held 12 and Trump three.\n\nIan Sams, a spokesman for Harris, told CNN Harris is \"going where people get their news, and in every setting she's taking questions-often tough ones-about her plans and agenda.\" He also mocked some of the methods Trump has used in an effort to influence the electorate.\n\n\"Maybe we're completely wrong and a two hour live space with Elon Musk or hawking some sketchy crypto venture is the best way to reach battleground swing voters, but I doubt it,\" Sams said.\n\nIn late August, the president of the White House News Photographers Association wrote a letter to Harris' campaign slamming them for an \"unprecedented reduction in access.\"\n\n\"You always just have to do enough national stuff to keep the press off your ass,\" Chuck Rocha, a Democratic strategist, told NBC News last week. \"I think she should do as many interviews as possible in battleground states, but the rest is a waste of time.\"\n\nTrump himself pointed out the disparity in an unscripted appearance on Fox News talk show Gutfeld! on Wednesday (Axios' tally of appearances did not include sitdowns with partisan commentators like the Republican ticket's friendly interviews with Fox News personalities or Walz's with MSNBC 's Rachel Maddow ).\n\n\"The interesting thing is she doesn't do interviews,\" Trump said, of why Harris isn't subject to more questions from the media. \"You would not see her come on to the show, I can tell you right now. She doesn't like doing interviews.\"\n\nEarlier this week, The New York Times reported that the Harris campaign has promised more appearances on local and national outlets are on the way. The campaign also told Axios their candidates had been subject to \"questions, often tough ones, about important issues\" in media appearances, pointing to the vice president's appearance with National Association of Black Journalists earlier this week.\n\nSome Democrats have openly called on the ticket to better showcase its candidates. In a New York Times /Siena poll released earlier this month, 31 percent of those surveyed said they felt they need to learn more about Harris, while only 12 percent said the same about Trump.\n\n\"More. More. More,\" Van Jones, a CNN commentator and former official in the Obama administration, said Tuesday evening. \"The polls show the more you see Kamala, the more you like Kamala.\"\n\nsean.craig@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "What Should Kamala Harris Do Next?\n\nKamala Harris deserves a big glass of wine. And hopefully in the weeks since Nov. 5, she's been kicking back in the Naval Observatory, spending time with her husband and loved ones and winding down the last few weeks of her vice presidential duties.\n\nPresident Joe Biden will be retiring to Delaware when his term ends. But Harris is vibrant and seems much younger than her 60 years. She's evolved dramatically since her first presidential run in 2020, evincing keen political instincts and an ability to recalibrate as necessary. Even with her loss, and the inevitable round of post-mortem punditry currently playing out, she seems like a woman in her political prime. So what should she do next?\n\nThere can be an impulse to assume a losing political candidate (and especially a presidential one) should be put out to pasture. Harris, though, was running not just against Donald Trump , but global anti-establishment headwinds: Incumbents lost elections in some 70 countries in 2024. Between inflation, post-pandemic disorder and a global migration boom, among other issues, voters are fed up with their political leaders. Harris, whatever her political talents, seems to have paid the price for crises beyond her control.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBy most accounts, the Harris campaign was a strong one. After Biden dropped out of the race, Harris put together a rockstar team and campaigned around the clock in the final few months before Election Day. Her energy was astounding. Yes, her campaign spent big . Yes, there were some mistakes-she absolutely should have gone on Joe Rogan 's podcast. But she no doubt learned some important lessons along the way, and there's much she can still bring to the country.\n\nThis doesn't mean that we need to see Harris running for president in 2028. The Democratic Party has a wealth of young and emerging talent, and as it regroups in the wake of this loss, it should shore up fresh ideas and newer faces: Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer , Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro , Reps. Ayanna Pressley and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez , among many others. But Harris would make a great governor of California, for example- she may not be the first woman to lead the nation, she could be the first to lead her home state. She would also make a fabulous law professor, and a huge draw to whichever school could grab her up.\n\nHarris is a career public servant and, despite her loss, a hot commodity. She is no doubt fielding all sorts of offers from the private sector, and one can understand the temptation to check out of politics and cash in. But I hope she doesn't.\n\nSo then the question is: What does Harris want? What motivates her?\n\nIn this moment, she is kind of like the trust fund kid who doesn't need the money but works anyway. That's a disappointing outcome no matter what: If the rich kid goes into banking, he's just accruing more money, and for what? How nauseatingly boring. But if he does something more interesting with his financial freedom-opens an art gallery, launches a non-profit, writes a novel-well, he didn't really earn his place amid his peers.\n\nI find myself holding the most respect for those who create or those who serve others. Maybe they didn't have to hustle like the rest of us. But if you could coast and choose instead to make something or give something, you-and the world-are probably better for it.\n\nTo be clear, Harris has hustled. Her current situation was hardly handed to her. But she is in a position now where she has nearly infinite choices in front of her (except, of course, the White House, which may have been the only one she really wanted).\n\nAnd I hope she blows up everyone's expectations.\n\nFew of us are ever afforded such wide-open doors, and most who are squander the opportunity. I hope Harris is asking herself what she can give back, but also what she can learn-what she can try that's new and challenging. I hope she takes on projects that thrill and scare her. I hope she models for the rest of us that there is no singular life path, and that sometimes the biggest disappointments clear out the space needed to build something truly original.\n\nConsider: What would you do if you were newly one of the most prominent people in the country, in incredible demand and facing scores of people ready to say yes to whatever you ask? Would you really go work at BlackRock?\n\nMaybe she wants to run an advocacy organization and make her (and her mother's) motto-\"You may be the first, but make sure you're not the last\"-a reality by supporting future female leaders. Maybe she wants to host her own cooking show. I'd watch! Maybe she wants to knit blankets for cat rescue organizations or save endangered coconut trees or collaborate with Converse on a line of pantsuit-appropriate Chuck Taylors .\n\nAs the first female vice president, and as the second woman to narrowly lose the White House, Harris no doubt finds herself quite burdened by what has been. But she can also choose to lay that baggage down and realize that she is in the extraordinarily lucky position of deciding, among limitless options, what can be-and who she can be in her post-election life.\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Why Was I So Wrong About Kamala Harris Winning?\n\nI was not just wrong about Tuesday's election results. I was spectacularly wrong.\n\nI predicted that not only would Kamala Harris win but that she would exceed expectations-scoring victories both in the popular vote and the electoral college. I also forecast that the final results for the election would be unknown to us for a long time and even then, that Donald Trump would contest them, dragging out the battle much as he did in 2020.\n\nWhen, watching the results come in, it became clearer and clearer to me that what I anticipated was not going to come to pass. However, my first reaction was not embarrassment or wondering where I went wrong. Those responses, which still nag at me, came later.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNo, at first, I felt deep sadness. It has been hard to shake, to be candid. In my view, not only is Donald Trump a terrible choice to be our president, but that Kamala Harris would have been an exceptionally good leader for America. I had studied her closely, followed her career for many years, written about her performance as Vice President, even got to meet with her in small settings several times. She was more than a gifted politician, she was a compassionate, caring, dedicated, highly effective public servant.\n\nFurthermore, I have always felt passionately that women have not been given the chances to lead in our society that they deserved and that it was high time we had a woman president.\n\nI was an early champion of Harris even when it was an extremely unpopular position to take. I felt she was maligned in her early days as Vice President. I had long hoped that Biden would give her a greater role and when he finally did, entering the last year or two of his term in office, I could see she was ready to lead us in a way that the aging, albeit exceptional effective president, would not be.\n\nI had long hoped he would honor his early statements that he saw himself as a transitional figure who would prepare the way for a new generation of leaders. When he faltered in the June debate, frustrated that he had not done so already, cognizant of the fact that many in his inner most circle of advisors thought that he had already lost a step, I was among those calling for him to step aside.\n\nHer response, the way she stepped into the role of candidate, the way she executed every demanding twist and turn in her truncated campaign, had confirmed my view that I was right about her. Further, evidence was beginning to accumulate that she was succeeding. She improved on Biden's standing in the polls. She energized the party.\n\nShe made a great VP pick. She made good decisions about keeping the campaign staff she inherited from Biden relatively intact. They broke fund-raising records. They attracted record numbers of volunteers. She consistently led in the polls, albeit by varying margins.\n\nHer message was good and got better. She moved to the center and an inclusive view of her presidency that brought in disaffected Republicans who had seen Trump's failures and abuses as president up close. Voter registrations seem to be trending in her favor. Early vote numbers seemed to be doing so as well. It looked like she would win because she would build on the gender gap that had developed in the wake of the Trump-authored repeal of Roe v. Wade.\n\nShe would add to the women who supported her, young voters who were galvanized by her, voters of color, Republicans and Independents. The response to her when she held arena rallies was every bit as electric as that generated by Barack Obama, the man who was previously the most effective campaigner I had seen in my lifetime.\n\nI studied the polling carefully. I was aware of the way polling averages had been skewed by \"red wave\" pollsters that were part of what appeared to be a disinformation campaign to justify post-election claims the results were rigged by Trump. I knew there were as many as a hundred such polls and I discounted them in my mind. I also discounted the polls that seemed not to take into account the realities of the new coalition she appeared to be putting together-such as the NYT/Siena poll.\n\nThe pieces had fallen into place. She was constantly exceeding expectations. It seemed only natural to me that she would do so again on Election Day-especially since the Trump campaign had less money, less energy, a less skilled ground operation, and a candidate who seemed to be drifting in and out of consciousness and the bounds of decent public behavior at his rallies.\n\nHe was the most profoundly flawed, compromised, dangerous candidate in American history-and every voter in America had had a chance to see that. Surely, they would not make what to me was the unthinkable error of electing him to the presidency for a second time.\n\nAfter the sadness and the PTSD came anger\n\nThe sadness at Kamala Harris' apparent defeat was soon blended with other feelings. One of them was a form of post-traumatic stress disorder. I had lived through this same kind of disappointment before with the defeat of another gifted woman candidate, Hillary Clinton . She too had been defeated by Trump who, in 2016, was already apparently a deeply flawed candidate and who was one who, unlike any other candidate in U.S. political history, had zero public service experience.\n\nAfter the sadness and the PTSD came anger. I was furious that the American people would make such an error. I was angry at those who had normalized Trump when he was, after all, a convicted felon, a man who stole national secrets, twice impeached, an accused sex abuser who had been judged by a jury to have been guilty of the equivalent of rape.\n\nHe seemed more loyal to the Kremlin and more drawn to despots worldwide than he was to our own country and allies. He had been judged by historians to be the worst president in our history. His track record as president was abysmal.\n\nHe mishandled the COVID epidemic in ways that led experts to believe hundreds of thousands of Americans died unnecessarily. His only legislative achievement was a tax cut that benefited the rich and drove inequality in America to even greater extremes. Then, after all that, he led a coup against the United States government and spent the next four years arguing that the election of 2020 had been stolen from him.\n\nHe was surrounded by advisors who had advanced plans that should he be reelected could lead to a gutting of our rights and democratic institutions. Further, he would have, thanks to a Supreme Court majority he had engineered, full immunity, the ability to ride roughshod over the law without repercussions. What is more, based on his campaign statements that is precisely what he was considering doing.\n\nHow could half the American electorate make the mistake of supporting such a man, especially when pitted against a far superior candidate who hailed from an administration that had literally been the most effective over one term of any in modern history?\n\nFinally, following the sadness and the PTSD and the anger there came disorientation. I felt like I was in an episode of Black Mirror . Suddenly, somehow the country I had gone to bed in on Monday night had been transformed into a completely different one on Tuesday.\n\nAll the factors that were to have played to the favor of Harris disappeared. All of the weaknesses of the Trump campaign were wiped away. If you had told me that there had been some op by a foreign government to manipulate election returns it would have actually seemed more plausible than getting so much wrong about so many aspects of the candidates and the race.\n\nBut that was crazy talk. I sounded like a MAGA conspiracy theorist. Surely that kind of operation was impossible. Right?\n\nHow could I have misread this so completely?\n\nSo I was forced to ask: Where did I go wrong? How could I, after decades in Washington, writing about and observing elections and governments in action, have misread this so completely? Maybe I was just letting my hopes influence my analysis. After all, there were plenty of polls that said the race would be close. I had found a way to rationalize them away in my mind. That was clearly a mistake on my part.\n\nCertainly, it seemed possible that some of what seemed possible or even likely did not materialize. Maybe her edge with women would not be so big-although women had repeatedly driven election results since the overturning of Roe. Maybe young voters would not turn out. Maybe Republicans would not be comfortable crossing over to vote for her.\n\nMaybe some of the states in which she held an edge-and she was said to be competitive in every battleground state-would not go her way. But it did not occur to me that all of these factors would be overplayed in my mind and those of many Democratic Party analysts with whom I spoke. Another mistake.\n\nMaybe my East Coast liberal feminism was getting the better of me. Maybe America was still too misogynistic for a woman to be president, too racist for a woman of color to be elected to the presidency. But she had been elected to the second highest office in the land, the first woman or woman of color or person of Asian descent ever to achieve such heights in American politics.\n\nCould it really be so simple? Many of the women and people of color I know and have spoken to since believe that played a great role in the outcome. Further, in the 24 hours since the defeat, I have learned more about real flaws in the Harris campaign, gaps in their attention, failure to heed warnings of things that ultimately came true. That included paying inadequate attention to key groups like Latino voters and perhaps paying too much to Republican cross-over voters who did not materialize as expected.\n\nHad I just not wanted to or been able to get to the truth behind the campaign's flaws in time to change my prediction? Also a factor in my mistaken analysis.\n\nFurther, upon reflection, I'm afraid there is more to it than all of the above reasons for my error. It is clear to me that I simply do not understand the motivations of at least half of the American electorate. I just don't full grasp their desire for strength or their grievances or their anger at the political establishment in Washington or the world as it looks through the lens of their media sources.\n\nPerhaps that it is because their lives are alien to my own experience. Almost certainly it is because I have not made a sufficient effort to understand them, although I truly believe I have tried. The results suggest however, that I have not done so to a sufficient degree.\n\nI believe Trump and the leaders of MAGA and the GOP and the billionaires who are funding and now increasingly fronting for their movement have cynically tapped into the dissatisfactions of tens of millions of Americans. I don't believe they truly care about them. There is little evidence to suggest that they do. They certainly have not done much to made the lives of average people or those who are struggling better.\n\nTheir appeal to racism and nativism and intolerance and the other dark forces within our society is a page directly out of the authoritarian playbook. But it is also true that what they have done has been politically effective.\n\nSuch cynical populism has been a part of American politics for centuries, of course. But to see it for the toxic, corrosive role it plays in our society-as we should-also can lead us to too easily dismiss whatever fundamental human impulses lie behind them. People don't set out to be evil. They want decent lives and they live in a world in which the system is rigged against them.\n\nAs it happens, the very people who they support politically are the ones who are engineering many of the sources of the exploding inequality in our society.\n\nUncomprehending alienation\n\nBut, as I said earlier, what is important and needs to be understood is that it works. We need to understand why it works in order to then understand why it works for so many. And we need to understand that, if we are to find a path to healing the divisions that now threaten America and to build a coalition that can actually put into power governments that can be seen by them to be hearing and addressing the needs of everyone.\n\nThe Biden Administration often sought to do this but apparently not often enough and what was achieved was not communicated well. (A great thought-provoking analysis of this can be found in this thread by my friend and colleague, one of the really great experts on American politics, Norm Ornstein .)\n\nI don't think we need to MAGA-ize the Democratic Party. I don't think we need populist hucksters and exploitative con men like some of those who achieved victory on Tuesday. But if we are to finally \"turn the page\" on them as Harris promised her election would do, we do need to understand better than I did the origins of their political success.\n\nThat is not to say that Democrats should make winning over MAGA votes our prime objective. Had Kamala Harris won a fraction of the 16 million more people who voted for Joe Biden in 2020 that did not vote for her this week, she would have won this race handily. So, better understanding of the needs and aspirations of our own base is where we must begin-and I was deeply surprised at how wrong we apparently got that too.\n\nSo perhaps, in recognizing errors like those I made, there is something of value. Perhaps there are lessons to be learned that may help us mount the effective political opposition that is so necessary within our system of government and is so critical at this moment. Perhaps there are insights that can help in future avoid losses like those Democrats have suffered this week.\n\nBut for now, I will admit, my deep embarrassment at having been so wrong is still not as an acute source of pain for me as the sadness I feel for the error I believe we have made as a nation. Perhaps that will fade with time.\n\nI hope that the four years ahead are more productive and less divisive and destructive than many of us have feared. But in addition, I also will work hard to never forget this feeling and that to never stop seeking ways to avoid this sense of uncomprehending alienation from my own country from ever happening again.\n\nGot a tip?

I mean, that's the Republican playbook-it was obvious that it was coming. How could she not be ready to answer Laken Riley and Mollie Tibbetts and so forth?\"\n\nRivera then proceeded to read comments from Riley's father , Jason Riley, in which he spoke about how the exploitation of his daughter's death for political purposes made him angry. The 22-year-old nursing student's killing in Georgia in February became a flashpoint in the national debate around immigration when Jose Ibarra, a man from Venezuela who entered the U.S. illegally, was accused. He has pleaded not guilty to multiple charges.\n\n\"Why couldn't the vice president say ... as she did that these are tragic deaths and the hearts go out and punched in the gut by it, but also say that these people, these poor victims, are being used for political purposes?\" Rivera asked. \"To me that's politics 101.\"\n\nHe added that he's not a politician but he knows \"a thing or two about debates.\"\n\n\"It just seems to me that she missed an opportunity, her briefers did, and from this moment on I advise them to not be the doormat when it comes to this issue,\" Rivera said. \"It is their biggest Achilles heel, there's no doubt about it. If Donald Trump wins it will be largely because of the immigration issue and the fact that Democrats not only blew the reality on the border over the last three-plus years, but they don't know how to respond to it, I think is malpractice.\"\n\nRivera's criticisms come after he announced Monday that he would not be voting for Trump-someone he once considered a \"loyal friend\"-in the election, citing the Republicans lies that the 2020 election was stolen.\n\n\"Former President Trump is a sore loser who cannot be trusted to honor the Constitution,\" Rivera wrote in a post on X . \"That is why I am voting for Kamala Harris to be our 47th President.\"\n\nBreaking News Editor\n\ndan.hall@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

When Ronald Regan won a blowout in 1984, 47 percent of Americans thought the country was on the right track.\n\n\"So there is no historical precedent for the White House party winning another term in the White House... when just 28 percent of the country thinks that we're on the right track,\" Enten said. \"Simply put, it would be historically unprecedented.\"\n\nPolling data has told a mix of different stories for Harris and her opponent, former President Donald Trump , in recent days. She swept polls on her debate performance versus Trump in early September, seeming to earn a bump for her election chances-especially in crucial swing states Pennsylvania and Michigan.\n\nA poll released in the past several days, however, showed that Trump was doing surprisingly well with Latino voters, a group that has historically leaned solidly Democrat.\n\nDespite his history of racist comments against Latinos, 40 percent said they would vote for the GOP nominee while 54 percent said they would vote for Harris-a 12-year low for Democratic nominees.\n\nBoth candidates are feverishly campaigning in battleground states 32 days out from the Nov. 5 general election.\n\nNews Reporter\n\nliam.archacki@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

Without Harris in the race, the primary is wide open,\" Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, told Newsweek .\n\nA decision to run for governor is likely to preclude the possibility of Harris embarking on a second presidential campaign in 2028, although she is said to be keeping that option open. Her aides have already assessed that the Democratic primary contest will be highly competitive, and may include Newsom, the current California governor.\n\nHarris, a former California attorney general, has already drawn support from the current holder of that post, Rob Bonta, who had previously been touted as a potential governor's candidate.\n\n\"Her name recognition, her favorables, her ability to run a successful campaign would have the impact of clearing the field on the Democratic side,\" Bonta told Politico. \"If anyone wants to stay in, will I tell them: 'You should leave because she's clearing the field?' Absolutely not. They can run. I think they'll lose, and I will support her.\""

      "text": "Harris urges young Americans to 'stay in the fight' in post-election speech\n\nUS vice-president reminds Democrats that 'this struggle is not new' in Maryland after losing presidency to Trump\n\nKamala Harris challenged young people to \"stay in the fight\" during a speech in Maryland on Tuesday, her first major address since conceding the presidential election to Donald Trump last month.\n\nIn her remarks, Harris expressed optimism in a future led by many of the young leaders in the room, praising their \"passion\" and \"resolve\" in spite of an electoral setback that threatens many of the causes they care deeply about.\n\n\"I ask you to remember that this struggle is not new. It goes back nearly 250 years to Lexington and Concord,\" Harris told a group of students, recent graduates, volunteers and apprentices at Prince George's Community College. \"Generation after generation, it has been driven by those who love our country, cherish its ideals and refuse to sit passive while our ideals are under assault.\n\n\"This fight now, it continues with you. You are its heirs,\" the vice-president said.\n\nSince the November election, Harris has maintained a relatively low profile. Next month, the vice-president, in her ceremonial role as president of the Senate, will certify Trump's victory and participate in the transfer of power. What she has planned next is unclear - but her punchy, optimistic speech made clear she had no plans to remain on the sidelines.\n\nHarris's remarks come as Democrats grapple with their unexpectedly sweeping defeat, with Republicans winning control of the White House and both chambers of Congress. One of the party's most bitter election day disappointments was the erosion of support among young people, long viewed as a key Democratic constituency and a group that Harris worked to mobilize during her whirlwind 107-day campaign .\n\nAccording to an analysis of early data by Tufts University's center for information and research on civic learning and engagement (Circle) , youth voter turnout in 2024 fell below the historic levels reached in 2020. Though Harris ultimately won youth voters overall, Trump made major gains among the cohort compared to four years ago. The shift was especially pronounced among white young people and young men.\n\nSince Barack Obama 's 2008 election, successful Democratic presidential nominees have won at least 60% of the youth vote. According to APVoteCast, Harris won 51% of voters under 30, a precipitous decline from 2020, when Joe Biden won 61% of those voters.\n\nYet Harris's entry into the presidential race thrilled many young liberals, especially women, motivated by her robust advocacy for reproductive rights. Nodding to a viral meme that flooded social media with coconut tree emojis, Harris said: \"I ask you to remember the context in which you exist.\" The line rippled across the auditorium as the crowd laughed and cheered. With a wide smile, Harris nodded: \"Yeah I did that.\"\n\nAs vice-president, she toured college campuses and spoke to issues that resonated with students and activists, including climate change and gun violence - which she raised on Tuesday to condemn the school shooting in Madison, Wisconsin , that left three people dead, including the 15-year-old shooter.\n\n\"We as a nation must renew our commitment to end the horror of gun violence, both mass shootings and everyday gun violence that touches so many communities in our nation,\" she said.\n\nAs Harris contemplates her political future, she could emerge as a leader in the anti-Trump resistance, particularly around the protection of reproductive rights and democratic norms, which she championed during her campaign. There is speculation that she could run for governor in California, her home state where she served as the attorney general and a US senator. At 60, she could even make another run for the White House in 2028, though she would likely face several other Democratic aspirants in a primary.\n\nHarris made no mention of her own future on Tuesday, but implied that she too intended to stay civically engaged, drawing inspiration from the tens of thousands of letters she has received in recent weeks.\n\nBut she also acknowledged the \"disappointment\" that has left many people feeling \"tired, maybe even resigned\".\n\n\"Let me be very clear,\" Harris said. \"No one can walk away.\"\n\n\"The true test of our commitment is whether, in the face of an obstacle, do we throw up our hands or do we roll up our sleeves?\" the vice-president added, drawing a prolonged \"mmhmm\" from several attendees that made everyone in the auditorium, Harris included, laugh.\n\nThe speaking program on Tuesday underscored Harris's message, which she first delivered in her concession speech, that young people should continue to believe that anything is possible despite seeing her history-making candidacy extinguished by a man who has stoked racial resentment and anti-immigrant backlash.\n\nSign up to Headlines US\n\nGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nAruna Miller, the lieutenant governor of Maryland , shared her story of arriving in the US from India at the age of 7, speaking no English. Now she is the first woman of color and immigrant to hold statewide office in Maryland. \"Shine you crazy diamonds,\" she told the young volunteers.\n\nAngela Alsobrooks, whose historic election to the Senate was one of the few bright spots for Democrats on election night, said the vice-president was the \"consummate reminder of the two things that you should never be told: that you're too young or nobody's ever done it\".\n\nAlsobrooks will be the first African-American politician to represent the state in the Senate when she takes the oath of office next month.\n\nAddressing the student leaders in the audience, the Maryland governor, Wes Moore, said he saw more than just inspiring stories: \"I see people who understand the assignment.\"\n\nThen the state's first Black governor spoke to the young people of color who are entering the workforce and civic society just as the Trump administration vows to rescind efforts to expand diversity and equity championed by the current White House.\n\n\"You were never in a room because of someone's social experiment. You were never in a room because someone wanted to sprinkle diversity into the room. You were in that room because you belong there, and you were in that room because that room was incomplete until you showed up,\" he said, drawing loud applause.\n\nIn Harris's remarks, she reminded young people that progress is often the hard-won result of everyday Americans pushing their political leaders forward.\n\n\"The movements for civil rights, women's rights, workers' rights, the United States of America itself, would never have come to be if people had given up their cause after a court case, or a battle, or an election did not go their way,\" she said.\n\n\"I urge you then, after you have had some rest. In fact, I challenge you to come back ready,\" Harris continued, concluding her remarks. \"Ready to chart our path to the future, chin up, shoulders back, forever impatient for change\"."

And he left the spreadsheet with another Harris aide.\"\n\nFight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House is Allen and Parnes's third campaign book after studies of Trump's win over Hillary Clinton in 2016 and defeat by Biden in 2020. The new book is published next week. The Guardian obtained a copy.\n\nParnes and Allen describe questions about Biden's fitness that grew throughout the 2024 election cycle. Trump and Republicans seized on Biden's age while Biden and White House aides vehemently insisted he was fit for another four-year term.\n\nAlready published extracts of Fight have concerned events after Biden withdrew: Harris's frustration over being unable to distance herself from Biden, an unpopular president, and her team's failure to land an interview with Joe Rogan, the influential podcaster whose three-hour chat with Trump came to be seen as a pivotal moment.\n\nBut Parnes and Allen devote the first half of their book to Biden's long, painful, public decline, leading to his historic decision to step aside while in office and eligible for a second four-year term.\n\nPart one of Fight is called The Unmaking of the President, a nod to The Making of the President 1960, Theodore H White's seminal book on John F Kennedy's win over Richard Nixon. Part two is called What It Took, a reference to Richard Ben Cramer's classic on the 1988 election - in which Biden plays a prominent part as a young Democratic senator whose first presidential campaign crashed and burned in public.\n\nWhen he dropped out in 1987, Biden was 44. In 2020, when his third presidential run ended in victory over Trump, he was 77. In 2023, after two years as the oldest president ever inaugurated, he was past 80 - and showing it.\n\n\"A handful of Democratic National Committee officials already had considered contingency plans,\" Allen and Parnes write. \"In hush-hush talks starting in 2023, these officials gamed out Biden-withdrawal scenarios, according to two people familiar with them.\n\n\"They wanted to make sure the party was ready for every possible circumstance: if Biden launched his campaign and then stepped aside before the primaries; if he won a bunch of primaries and then could not continue. If he secured enough delegates for winning the nomination but dropped out before winning a floor vote at the convention, and if he left a vacancy at the top of the ticket after taking the nomination.\"\n\nAccording to Parnes and Allen, the \"hush-hush\" planning was focused on what party rules said would happen in any such scenario \"and how they might need to be changed, if the president no longer had the desire, or the ability, to run\".\n\n\"One official involved in secret talks put a fine point on the fear that Biden would not make it to election day as the party's nominee: 'It shows what we had to do to prepare with the unique circumstances we had, which was an 80-plus-year-old president who was running.\"\n\nBiden remained determined, egged on by family including his wife Jill Biden and legally troubled son, Hunter Biden, and by veteran aides. Parnes and Allen describe tensions between such factions but also chaotic preparations for what turned out to be the only Biden-Trump debate . That 80-minute meeting took place in Atlanta, Georgia, on 27 June. Biden's performance - stiff, confused and weak - has gone down in history as perhaps the most catastrophic of all time.\n\nStill, it took nearly a month for party pressure to build to a sufficient pitch to force Biden to relinquish his grip on power.\n\nSign up to Headlines US\n\nGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nIn a particularly striking passage, Parnes and Allen describe a donors' reception hosted by Phil Murphy, then governor of New Jersey, on 29 June 2024, two days after the debate disaster. Biden reportedly needed to have florescent tape fixed to the carpet, \"colorful bread crumbs [that] showed the leader of the free world where to walk\".\n\n\"He knows to look for that,\" one aide explained.\n\nAt the same event, Biden reportedly needed an autocue for \"unscripted\" remarks and then spoke haltingly in a Q&A with Murphy.\n\n\"He didn't look well,\" the authors write. \"He didn't sound vital.\"\n\nSuch moments only increased party pressure. Allen and Parnes report an extraordinary conversation between Biden and Barack Obama , to whom Biden was vice-president between 2009 and 2017. In doing so, they quote Obama but present Biden's thoughts in italics, indicative of close sourcing, perhaps from Biden himself.\n\n\"What is your path?\" Obama asked.\n\n\" What's my path? Biden thought as he listened to Obama. What's your fucking plan? \"\n\nSuch high drama is ultimately matched with brutal pathos. Parnes and Allen report how Obama and other party grandees eventually came to back Harris as the only alternative to Biden.\n\n\"One veteran operative summed up the sentiments of Democrats who worried they would get stuck with Harris but still wanted Biden out: 'Well, at least she has a pulse.'\""

Now the vice-president is joining the party\n\nA fter Kamala Harris announced her bid for president, she reportedly raised a record-breaking $81m donations in just a day - but her most culturally powerful endorsement may have come from a single tweet.\n\nAs nearly all Democrats rallied behind the vice-president offering support in tweets and TV interviews, a perhaps unlikely voice weighed in: the British pop singer Charli xcx , who tweeted, \"kamala IS brat.\"\n\nThat's high praise from the musician, who released her album, also titled Brat, last month. Brat is not just a name, but a lifestyle, one inspired by noughties excess and rave culture.\n\nThe archetypical brat, Charli explained on TikTok, is \"just like that girl who is a little messy and likes to party and maybe says some dumb things sometimes, who feels herself, but then also maybe has a breakdown, but kind of parties through it\".\n\nBrat summer essentials, again according to Charli , are \"a pack of cigs, a Bic lighter, a strappy white top with no bra\".\n\nPerhaps most importantly, Charli chose a neon lime backdrop for her album cover, one that's sickeningly sweet, representing both the highs of a long night out and the impending crash of a hangover.\n\nCanonical brats include the actor and model Julia Fox, who appeared in the music video for Charli's 360 alongside a cast of fellow proclaimed it girls such as Chloë Sevigny, Hari Nef, and Emma Chamberlain. Now, Harris joins their ranks.\n\nSoon after receiving Charli's apparent approval, the Harris campaign's official Twitter page ( @kamalahq ) changed its backdrop to brat green. Charli's song 365, an ode to \"bumpin' that\" - meaning beats, and club drugs - soundtracks one of the team's TikTok videos.\n\nPoliticians have long used celebrities to court the youth vote, walking a fine line between speaking their language and grasping for relevancy. Millennials considered Hillary Clinton's infamous \"Pokémon go to the polls\" line from 2016 peak cringe. Last year, Taylor Swift urged fans to vote in primaries - she didn't say who for - driving a surge in voter registrations.\n\nGevin Reynolds, a former speechwriter for Harris, said he believes it's \"extremely smart for her to lean into the meme\".\n\n\"It shows a recognition of how critical young voters are to winning in November, and a commitment to meeting them where they are.\"\n\nSo far, there's been little Brat back-lash, though pundits over the age of 35 seem confused by the topic. CNN's Jake Tapper dedicated a roundtable to the topic, concluding that he \"will aspire to be brat\". Stephen Colbert took up a Brat-themed TikTok dance during The Late Show.\n\nDavid Hogg, a survivor of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting and gun control activist, wrote on X that \"The amount [Charli's] single tweet may have just done for the youth vote is not insignificant.\" He later confirmed that \"Nancy Pelosi has been informed of the meaning of Brat\".\n\nMemes alone do not win elections, but Charli's tweet livened up a race that Harris's bid had already revived. But there is more to be done. Kelley Heyer, the TikTok creator who choreographed a popular dance to Charli's song Apple, said: \"If Kamala wants to be brat, then she needs to promise to legalize and protect abortion at a federal level. And also wear apple green.\""

Even then there was to be one more insult as Republicans in the House of Representative interrupted her with loud applause and cheering.\n\nThe vice-president stood ramrod-backed, hands folded, wearing a half-smile, half-grimace as the acclaim went on, eventually reaching for the gavel to restore order. \"Kamala D Harris of the state of California has received 226 votes,\" she then said, prompting counter-cheers from Democrats.\n\nHarris said the results were a \"sufficient declaration\" of the election of a president and vice-president starting their terms on 20 January. Senator JD Vance, the vice-president-elect, wearing Trumpian white shirt and red tie, fist-bumped Senator Bill Cassidy; Harris shook hands with the speaker, Mike Johnson, who patted her on the back; and the entire chamber - Democrats and Republicans - stood and applauded.\n\nIt was a rare moment of unity in a political era marked by disunity, ending a formal process that had been extraordinary in its ordinariness. Four years after a pro-Trump mob attacked the US Capitol in an effort to overturn his election defeat, this was a January 6 without rancour or bloodshed.\n\nThis time no defeated president urging his supporters to \"fight like hell\"; no challenges to the integrity of the vote; no Confederate flag brandished in the corridors of power; no QAnon shaman storming the Senate; no mob calling for the vice-president to be hanged.\n\nFour years later the Capitol was covered in snow with roads blocked off for miles. Police were out in force and non-scalable fencing erected for what has been designated a national special security event. Sealed electoral certificates from each state were brought into the House chamber in mahogany boxes and allowed to stay without being rushed to safety.\n\nThe public gallery was only half full and there were no disruptions as four tellers - referring to Harris as \"Madam President\" of the Senate - took turns reading the results from each state. Most were greeted with polite applause as if at a piano recital. But Trump's victory in Florida was greeted with clapping and a yelp from Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene. The Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas delegations also celebrated raucously.\n\nJohn Thune, the new Republican majority leader in the Senate, sat in the front row with chin on hand, wiggling his right leg like a tall man in economy on a long flight. Across the aisle, his Democratic counterpart Schumer sunk into his chair, staring ahead, hands folded, barely moving. Further back was Jamie Raskin, among those who fled for their lives on January 6, later a key figure on the House panel that investigated it - who knows what he was thinking.\n\nIt was all wrapped up in half an hour, after which various Republicans posed for selfies with Vance on the House floor. But this was a case of two cheers for democracy. Monday went smoothly for a simple reason: Trump won.\n\nDemocrats, who have raised symbolic objections in the past, including during the disputed 2000 election that Al Gore lost to George W Bush, had no intention of objecting. \"There are no election deniers on our side of the aisle,\" the minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, said on the first day of the new Congress.\n\nHaving laid siege to the Capitol, Trump and his allies have spent four years laying siege to the truth. There is no better example of polarisation in America - and the alternate-reality \"mirror world\" fostered by one side - than the events of 6 January 2021.\n\nThe objective truth is that a mob of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol with clubs, chemicals and other weapons. The attack led to five deaths; more than 140 police officers were injured in the carnage. \"What I saw was just a war scene,\" Capitol police officer Caroline Edwards later told the House January 6 committee. \"I was slipping in people's blood.\"\n\nIn a statement released on Monday, Frederica Wilson, a Democratic congresswoman, said she still trembled at the date January 6, recalling: \"We ran and crawled on our knees to safety with the fear of death hanging over our heads. They left the statues in statuary hall broken and smeared with excrement and blood. Police officers were bloodied, beaten, battered, and died. It was like playing a role in a horror movie and hoping that it would soon come to an end.\"\n\nBut in the Maga [Make America great again] universe, such memories are rendered illegitimate. In this telling, January 6 was a heroic attempt to \"stop the steal\" of the 2020 election. Trump has called it a \"day of love\" and vowed to pardon those convicted of crimes; Congressman Andrew Clyde of Georgia compared it to a \"normal tourist visit\"; Kash Patel, Trump's nominee for FBI director, has repeatedly promoted a conspiracy theory accusing the FBI of orchestrating the attack.\n\nMost telling has been how, over the past four years, Trump has gone from disgraced pariah to wronged victim to conquering hero. He was impeached for his role in January 6 and condemned by even staunch Republican allies. Yet one by one they came back to the fold and became complicit in rewriting history. Trump now regularly plays an eerie, tinny version of the national anthem sung over a phone by January 6 prisoners (recast as martyrs) - weaponising a day of shame into a political asset.\n\nThe exercise was surely made possible by the fracturing of media. No longer could a handful of trusted news anchors tame a lie and keep it caged. A powerful rightwing ecosystem - including Elon Musk's X - has systematically neutralised, undercut and spun the eyewitness accounts from January 6. The Public Religion Research Institute's 2024 American Values Survey found that 62% of Republicans continue to believe the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.\n\nAs in George Orwell's 1984, the past, it seems, has been abolished. \"Every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street building has been renamed, every date has been altered,\" Orwell wrote.\n\nLike Vice-Presidents Gore and Mike Pence before her, Harris did her duty on Monday. America has returned to a peaceful transfer of power. Yet the unpalatable truth was that the candidate who tried to overturn the previous election is legitimately returning to power. Democracy had prevailed to elevate a man who spits in its face."

      "text": "Former Harris aide suggests Biden resign so she can serve as president\n\nJamal Simmons says move would help Democrats seize public's attention before Trump begins term in January\n\nA former communications director for Kamala Harris has made the unlikely suggestion that Joe Biden resign so she can become the first woman to serve as US president after her defeat to Donald Trump in the 5 November election.\n\nJamal Simmons offered the thought during an appearance as a panelist on Sunday on CNN's State of the Union news show when asked what should be the top priority for the US before Trump begins his second presidency in January.\n\nThough there is no indication Biden has considered it, Simmons said he \"could resign the presidency in the next 30 days [to briefly] make Kamala Harris the president of the United States\".\n\nSimmons said the move would not only spare Harris from having to certify her own defeat to Trump in the US Senate as part of her role as vice-president - but it also \"would dominate the news at a point [when] Democrats have to learn\" to seize the public's attention.\n\n\"Joe Biden's been a phenomenal president,\" Simmons said . \"He's lived up to so many of the promises he's made.\n\n\"There's one promise left that he can fulfill: being a transitional figure.\"\n\nDana Bash, State of the Union's host, replied by alluding to how the idea had previously been discussed among social media users who were disillusioned with how voters had returned Trump to the White House at the vice-president's expense. \"This has now jumped from an internet meme to a Sunday morning talk show,\" Bash remarked.\n\nHarris ascended to the top of the Democratic party's ticket in July when Biden dropped his re-election bid in the wake of a disastrous debate performance against Trump in June. Biden endorsed Harris to face the Republican party leader in the 5 November election.\n\nBut the pair's relationship became tense as she sought to distance herself from his record, making it difficult to see Simmons' vision of Biden stepping down in the closing days of his presidency becoming reality.\n\nThings between Harris and Biden came close to rock bottom in the waning days of the race, as her team tried to capitalize on a comedian at a pro-Trump rally in New York City insulting Puerto Rico as a \"floating island of garbage\". They felt undermined in their effort when Biden soon came out and appeared to refer to Trump's supporters as \"garbage\", giving Republicans the opportunity to express offense in the press.\n\nBiden's subsequent clarification that he meant to only single out Trump's \"supporter's ... demonization of Latinos\" - meaning the comedian's - rang hollow.\n\nSign up to This Week in Trumpland\n\nA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nHarris ultimately lost every key battleground to Trump, costing her the electoral college and the popular vote, leaving her as the first Democratic presidential candidate since 2004 to lose the latter.\n\nDavid Plouffe, a senior Harris campaign adviser, soon wrote on the social media platform X that her team had \"dug out of a deep hole\" in running against Trump \"but not enough\". The post from Plouffe - who guided Barack Obama's successful 2008 run for the presidency - was widely interpreted as a dig against Biden for dropping out long after critics had first pressured him to do so.\n\nPlouffe subsequently deleted his X account. And reportedly sources from within the president's team told Fox News that Plouffe was a \"sanctimonious ass\" - and that Biden had managed to beat Trump in 2020 without his help.\n\nSimmons served as Harris's communications director for about a year beginning in January 2022. The political operative is the co-host of the TrailBlaze podcast."

      "text": "Kamala Harris had a whirlwind 107-day campaign. What's next for her?\n\nVice-president's next move could involve California politics, a re-run for 2028 or a thinktank, among others\n\nW hatever happened to Kamala Harris ? For 107 days she was everywhere, filling TV screens and campaign rallies in her whirlwind bid for the White House. Then, with election defeat by Donald Trump, it all ended as abruptly as it began. The rest is silence.\n\n\"The vice-president has taken time off to go spend time with her family,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Thursday , acknowledging that Harris is holidaying in Hawaii with husband Doug Emhoff. \"She has worked very hard for the last four years, and her taking a couple of days to be with her family, good for her.\"\n\nWith Trump's special brand of chaos already dominating the Washington agenda, Harris's vice-presidency is clearly in a winding down. When she formally leaves office on 20 January, she will face her first spell as a private citizen since she was elected San Francisco's district attorney in 2003.\n\nSpeculation has already begun as to what might come next. While Harris, 60, has not announced any specific plans, supporters suggest that options include a move into the private sector, a return to California politics - or another presidential run in 2028.\n\nBakari Sellers , a close ally of Harris and former representative from South Carolina, said: \" She can do anything she wants to do. She's more than capable. She's given this country more than enough. She can go to the private sector and make money. She can go to a law school and teach.\n\n\"She can be governor of California and pretty much clear the field. She can run for president again. Or she can just say to hell with it and go and spend time with Dougie. That decision hasn't been made yet but her options are plentiful. \"\n\nThe last incumbent vice-president to lose an election was Al Gore in 2000. He went on to make an Oscar-winning documentary, An Inconvenient Truth , and win the Nobel peace prize for his efforts to combat the climate crisis.\n\nElection losers since then have included John Kerry, later a secretary of state, and John McCain and Mitt Romney, both of whom served in the Senate. Hillary Clinton wrote a book about her 2016 defeat entitled What Happened, while the 2020 election loser, Trump, bounced back to regain the White House earlier this month.\n\nHarris might be tempted by a spell in the private sector. Law firms and lobbying groups would welcome her legal background and political connections. Alternatively she could contribute to the policy debate by joining a thinktank or launching her own advocacy organisation.\n\nShe could also write a book offering her perspective on her time in Joe Biden's White House, including its internal tensions, and her hastily improvised campaign against Trump. Its level of candour would probably depend on whether she is planning a return to the political arena.\n\nCalifornia governor Gavin Newsom is term-limited in 2026, raising the prospect of Harris seeking to make more history by becoming the state's first female governor. As a former California senator and attorney general, she enjoys high name recognition in the state and would have no problem attracting donors.\n\nHarris would be following in the footsteps of Richard Nixon, who lost the 1960 presidential election and ran for California governor two years later. But he lost that race, too. He told reporters: \"You don't have Nixon to kick around any more, because, gentlemen, this is my last news conference.\" He roared back to win the presidency in 1968.\n\nHarris would, however, face competition from fellow Democrats in 2026. Lieutenant governor Eleni Kounalakis, a longtime Harris ally, has already announced her candidacy , potentially setting up a contentious primary contest.\n\nBill Whalen , a political consultant and speechwriter who has worked for California governors Arnold Schwarzenegger and Pete Wilson, said: \"There's a gubernatorial race sitting there waiting for her if she wants it. If you look at the polls, there is no clear frontrunner. If she were to jump in, she would immediately push most Democrats out of the race and, given California's politics, if it's her versus a Republican in November, she would be a cinch to win it. \"\n\nThe governorship of California, the most populous state in the US, would offer a high-profile platform that could keep Harris in the national spotlight and potentially position her for a future presidential run. Like Newsom, Harris could style herself as a leader of the Democratic resistance to Trump.\n\nBut focusing on a gubernatorial race could detract from Harris's efforts to build national support and momentum for a potential 2028 presidential campaign. Whalen, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University in California, said: \"The question is, does she want to be a governor or does she want to be a president? If she wants to be president, then governor is not the right path because she would have to run for that office in 2026 and pivot right around and run for president in 2027 .\"\n\nIf Harris became governor, she might have to wait until 2032 for another White House bid. Whalen commented: \"That's a long time to wait in politics. If she wants to run for president again, then it's pretty simple: she and Gavin Newsom and [Illinois governor] JB Pritzker and others have to figure out who is the tip of the spear of the so-called resistance. That would be the card for her to play. \"\n\nDemocrats are still shellshocked by Harris's 312-to-226 defeat by Trump in the electoral college. But as of Thursday's count, she was trailing Trump by only 1.7% in the national popular vote. She had a total of 74.3m votes, the third-highest popular vote total in history after Biden in 2020 and Trump in 2024.\n\nThe idea of Harris making another bid for the White House in 2028 is already being floated. She retains access to the Democratic party's most extensive donor network.\n\nA Morning Consult opinion poll this week found that 43% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents said they would vote for Harris if the party's 2028 presidential primary were held today. She was well ahead of transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg at 9% and Newsom at 8%.\n\nBut precedent is against her. Democrats have historically shown little appetite for re-nominating candidates who previously lost presidential elections, as Gore could testify. Moreover, following the defeats of both Clinton and Harris, the party will undoubtedly grapple with whether they want to put forward a woman for the third time. Democrats may also be inclined to move on from the Biden-Harris era and seek fresh faces.\n\nChris Scott , who was coalitions director for Harris during the campaign, said: \"I have no idea what she plans on doing next. I have definitely heard the reports, as have a lot of folks around her, of her potentially running for governor. It would be a great thing for California if that was what she decided to do and it also keeps her in the conversation. \"\n\nScott pointed to Harris's strong advocacy for issues such as reproductive rights and economic opportunity. \"There is a chance that she could run in 2028 again. Obviously a lot of things have to look different next time around. But a loss here does not negate that she has been an outstanding public servant for her entire career. It is my hope that we have not seen the last of her in politics.\""

      "text": "Kamala Harris promises full marijuana legalization - is that a gamechanger?\n\nThe Democrat says she will end cannabis prohibition and seek to help Black men profit from the industry if elected\n\nKamala Harris announced on Monday that if elected president, she would fully legalize adult recreational cannabis on the federal level - the first time a presidential nominee has taken such an unambiguous stance on ending cannabis prohibition.\n\nAs part of her pledge, she said she would take steps to ensure that Black men, disproportionately incarcerated and disenfranchised by the war on drugs, would stand to profit from the industry.\n\nVince Sliwoski, a partner at the cannabis law firm Harris and Sliwoski, said he \"was happy to see it, because I like the messaging\", but added: \"She can't just snap her fingers and do it when she gets into office. It's not something that can be done via executive orders.\"\n\nGriffen Thorne, also an attorney specializing in cannabis, felt the promise was \"clearly political\", given the announcement came just three weeks before the election. Thorne and other experts the Guardian spoke to suspect Harris's campaign is attempting to shore up numbers with Black voters, particularly Black men, who are currently less likely to support Harris than they were Biden, according to a New York Times poll.\n\n\"Federal marijuana legalization is a sound policy and supporting it is a smart strategy - not just with Black voters, but with Americans across the board,\" said Cat Packer, director of drug markets and legal regulation with Drug Policy Action.\n\n\"As a Black woman and the first person of color to regulate marijuana for both medical and adult use, I understand the challenges in creating legal marijuana markets that work for Black men. I also recognize the profound harms caused by federal prohibition.\"\n\nPacker added that it makes sense for Harris's plan to include provisions that will remove barriers for Black men in cannabis and other domains.\n\nNotably, the pledge sets Harris apart from both her opponent and her predecessor. While Trump and Biden now support some level of cannabis legalization, Harris is the first to explicitly state that ending prohibition is a priority.\n\nDuring his administration, Biden made a number of promises on cannabis, including to expunge criminal records for possession convictions and get cannabis rescheduled so that it is eligible for FDA approval. The DEA has made progress on rescheduling, but it won't go through before the election.\n\nAnd Biden only expunged a small fraction of cannabis-related convictions during his administration.\n\n\"It was kind of embarrassing, because he kept up on his website all this stuff he was promising,\" said Sliwoski.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has changed his tune on cannabis during this election season, including by supporting an upcoming Florida ballot initiative that would legalize recreational cannabis. But the decisions he made during his presidency left a lasting sense of distrust among advocates.\n\n\"One of the first things he did was appoint war on drugs zealot Jeff Sessions as his attorney general,\" said Sliwoski, \"The industry was really on edge, at least for the first couple of years of Trump's regime,\" he explained.\n\nHarris also distinguishes herself from Trump in calling for social equity provisions that help Black men benefit from the industry. But making such provisions work is tricky. Even when Democrats controlled both houses of Congress during Biden's administration, Thorne pointed out that they were unable to successfully pass cannabis policy reform - in part because of disagreements about whether social equity provisions went far enough.\n\n\"They let the perfect be the enemy of the good,\" said Thorne.\n\nWhile some Republicans in Congress now support cannabis reform, Thorne adds, they are less likely to vote for bills with a lot of social equity stipulations.\n\nSliwoski suggests looking at the More Act to try to get a sense of what kind of provisions Harris might support if elected president.\n\nHarris co-sponsored the bill when it was introduced in Congress in 2019. The act would require the Bureau of Labor Statistics to track demographic information about cannabis business owners and employees, and create a trust fund devoted to initiatives that help communities hurt by the war on drugs.\n\nState-level laws have attempted similar initiatives, but they often fail - the state legal cannabis industry is still heavily dominated by already wealthy white men.\n\n\"Inequities in the cannabis industry are due in part to banking restrictions and the high cost of entry into the market,\" said Katharine Neill Harris, a drug policy fellow at Rice University. \"Individuals need to have money at the beginning of the process, or they need wealthy investors, and white men tend to have more of both.\"\n\nSocial equity initiatives didn't fully address barriers to entry in the industry, and sometimes gave funding to people with dubious connections to the marginalized communities they were intended to serve, according to reporting from Politico .\n\nWithin the industry, reactions to Harris's pledge are mixed.\n\n\"I'm not shocked to hear another politician make claims for federal legalization of cannabis in hopes of catching a few extra votes during an election year. It's not the first time, but I do hope it's the last,\" said Caleb Counts, CEO of Connected Cannabis . \"This industry has been strung along far too many times with far too many broken promises.\"\n\nOn the other hand, Bryan Gerber, CEO of the rolling paper company Hara Supply, found the news encouraging as Harris's support for cannabis reform predated her presidential candidacy.\n\n\"With Harris's stance clear, it seems hopeful that she would sign a full-scale legalization bill or related legislation, such as increased medical marijuana access for veterans, social justice initiatives and industry banking reforms,\" Gerber said. \"This, of course, is only possible if Congress can successfully land a bill on the president's desk.\"\n\nThis article was amended on 19 October 2024 to correct the surname of Cat Packer, which we had previously given as \"Power\".

      "text": "Harris Ran to Trump's Right on Immigration - and Gained Absolutely Nothing For It\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nHarris could have focused on how U.S. foreign policy pushes immigrants to leave their homes. Instead, she ran on border security.\n\nJust six weeks after Joe Biden's inauguration, 80 House Democrats urged the newly sworn-in president to immediately renew diplomatic engagement with Cuba and end the \"cruel\" sanctions imposed by the Trump administration.\n\nThe letter encouraged Biden to end the blockade and take executive action to reverse Trump's policies.\n\nBiden ignored the plea. Not long after the letter was sent, a White House official told Reuters that a quick Cuba policy shift was not a top priority.\n\nThe decadeslong U.S. embargo against Cuba rolled on, hitting the Cuban people first and foremost. During the pandemic, this sanctions regime led to severe food and medical shortages on the island. People left in droves.\n\nSince 2020, Cuba has seen the largest exodus in its entire history. Over 1 million people left between 2022 and 2023 alone as a result of the economic crisis.\n\nAnd they came to the U.S.\n\nCuba became one facet of an immigration debate in the U.S. that took a central role in the presidential election.\n\nDonald Trump railed against immigrants , presenting them as a threat to a supposed American way of life. Kamala Harris, for her part, embraced this same narrative , if not the rhetoric, and yet had nothing to show for it on Wednesday morning.\n\nIt was an unsupportable, immoral, and unpopular position. And Harris gained nothing.\n\nIt was a typical Democratic folly: the wrong position that is also bad politics. There was a way out of the race to the bottom in the immigration debate - and there still is. If Harris and the Democratic Party are to have any hope, they must learn on this issue, like so many others, to address it by examining its root causes.\n\nIt's a pattern seen all over Latin America: U.S. policies foist hardships on those abroad , who then migrate to the U.S. in search of better lives.\n\nTake Venezuela, which has sent record numbers of immigrants to the U.S. following the imposition of of devastating American sanctions in recent years.\n\nIn Honduras and El Salvador too, hawkish U.S. foreign policies built on everything from anti-communism to the drug war have propelled droves of immigrants to U.S. shores.\n\nAnd yet, within the 2024 presidential race, these root causes of these crises - the push factors - never came up.\n\nInstead, Trump railed against immigrants in general. And, rather than pledging to enact a humane border policy and working internationally to slow emigration, Harris chose to ignore the issue altogether - or to run to Trump's right.\n\nIt did not need to be this way. Harris could have simply listened to the American people, who understand aspects of the immigration conundrum better than politicians seems to understand.\n\nAbout 71 percent of Americans, including majorities across the political spectrum, believe economic factors are largely behind the recent influx of migrants, whether it's better opportunities in the U.S. or poor conditions in their home countries, according to a report from the Pew Research Center. Sixty-five percent pointed to violence in migrants' home countries as a major reason for driving so many people to the U.S.\n\nNotably, the report also found that a sizable majority of Americans consider the influx of migrants a crisis or at least a major problem. Though Republicans were more likely to view it as a crisis, Democrats still mostly viewed the situation as a major problem. Only 7 percent of Democrats surveyed said it's not a problem at all.\n\nHarris touted herself as a former border-state prosecutor who would be tougher on the Southern frontier than Trump. During the presidential debate , Harris bragged about supporting a border bill that would have \"put 1,500 more border agents on the border.\"\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nIt's increasingly clear that the economic warfare the U.S. unleashes on the world comes with a steep political cost. With Republicans leading the charge, Democrats have little to show for going along with it.\n\nNot every Democrat, however, has acquiesced to right-wing narratives on immigration.\n\nLast year, border state Reps. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, and Raúl Grijalva, D-Ariz., tried warning Biden again.\n\n\"Rather than re-imposing Trump-era deterrence policies,\" they wrote, \"we must demonstrate a sharp contrast with these approaches by showing compassion towards migrants and upholding our asylum obligations, while simultaneously seeking to curb the broad-based sanctions that contribute to widespread suffering and spur increased migration.\"\n\n\"You have a historic opportunity to help mitigate economic push-factors driving migration and affecting our border and many of our cities, while reorienting U.S. policy in the hemisphere towards a more holistic approach that eschews destructive sanctions policies to focus on peace, stability, and prosperity for all inhabitants of the Americas,\" the letter continued .\n\nThat opportunity was available for Harris to seize during the presidential race. She could have offered an alternative vision for how the U.S. treats the world and the people who arrive at our borders from abroad.\n\nInstead, she tried - and failed - to co-opt Trump's talking points. Despite her best efforts, Trump's immigration attacks on Harris contributed to her election loss.\n\nNow everyone, immigrants and non-immigrants alike, must suffer the consequences.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Trump Didn't Win Pennsylvania. Kamala Harris Lost It.\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe problem isn't that cities like Reading are now Trump strongholds, but that Harris's campaign gave few reasons for enthusiasm.\n\nOne day before the presidential election, Vice President Kamala Harris made her first campaign visit to Reading, Pennsylvania - a majority Latino city just an hour outside of Philadelphia. Donald Trump's campaign had been running outreach to Latino voters in the Berks County city since June, when the Republican National Committee opened a Latino Americans for Trump office as it ramped up its appeals to Latino voters across the state.\n\nWhen votes were counted in Berks County, the gap between the campaigns was stark. As in 2020, Berks again went for Trump on Tuesday - this time up 4.6 percentage points to 58 percent. Harris received 43 percent of the vote, where President Joe Biden had won 45.2 percent in 2020.\n\nThe problem was not that Berks had become a Republican stronghold, but that Democrats had ceded the territory long before Trump opened his campaign office this summer. It was a familiar story to progressive organizers across Pennsylvania, who have spent the last several campaign cycles trying to claw back voters Democrats have left on the table.\n\nDemocratic consultants in Pennsylvania had been caught on their heels in 2016, when Trump flipped the state red for the first time in three decades and won three counties that had voted twice for former President Barack Obama. When Biden won Pennsylvania back in 2020, analysts and organizers attributed the win to the work done in progressive cities like Philadelphia. But it wasn't the Biden campaign doing the legwork , it was progressives and independents working within coalitions led by groups like Pennsylvania Stands Up, Make the Road Action Pennsylvania, the Working Families Party, and unions like Unite Here and Service Employees International Union.\n\nDemocrats' reliance on progressive enclaves and local organizers to fill the gap they lost with Trump's first win was never more clear than in the midnight hours heading into Wednesday, as Trump pulled away with electoral votes and Harris's narrowing path to victory fell once again to voters in cities like Philadelphia.\n\nWhile Biden won 13 Pennsylvania counties in 2020, Harris won just eight - with Trump flipping the counties of Bucks, Northampton, Erie, Monroe, and Centre. As the results solidified for Trump, mainstream media and Democratic pundits turned their fire not at the Harris campaign and the Democratic Party but in two other directions - at minority voters who had drifted, along with white men and women, toward Trump; and at progressives who had either stayed home or voted third party over Harris's role in the Biden administration's support for Israel's war on Gaza.\n\nSuch criticism was misguided, said Working Families Party National Director Maurice Mitchell. Democrats, he said, had ceded turf to Republicans in states like Pennsylvania despite knowing they held the only key to winning the White House.\n\n\"That coalition is fraying at the margin for a number of reasons,\" Mitchell said Tuesday night at WFP's watch party at the Sheraton Hotel in downtown Philadelphia.\n\nPeople are asking basic questions of both parties, Mitchell said. \"What concretely and materially are we gaining from this relationship? And they deserve answers.\"\n\nThat the race was so close is raising a vital conversation about Democrats' continued failure to build power outside of the four-year election cycle, said Philadelphia City Council minority whip Nicolas O'Rourke. \"Voting is the last thing that we do in a functioning democracy.\"\n\nO'Rourke is one of two Working Families Party members on the city council. Local Democrats fought tooth and nail against the WFP, but the group's wins ousted Republicans from the council in the heavily blue city for the first time in history with O'Rourke's 2023 win. He said the focus on whether Black men had strayed from the Harris campaign missed the larger reason for demographic shifts.\n\n\"The issue that I found, more often than not, was not an interest in Trump, it was a lack of interest in engagement. And that has been true beyond just this election season and cycle,\" O'Rourke said. \"I continue to believe that there is an opportunity to engage Black men. They feel forgotten, not seen. They don't see the value in voting - some of them, not all. ... There's a lot to be said about engagement from the political parties actually connecting with Black men before you're expecting them to turn out.\"\n\n\"That is something that every party should be paying attention to, whether it's election season or not, because a functioning democracy would care about that.\"\n\nA few hours before Harris made her first stop in Reading, Trump held a rally with thousands of people at the city's downtown Santander Arena.\n\nWhile Trump made fewer stops in Pennsylvania than Harris - 22 to Harris's 26 - Republican groundwork targeting voters in Latino, Black, and white working-class neighborhoods allowed him to outperform Democrats, who put much of their focus into persuading affluent voters in blue strongholds.\n\nWhile Latino men and women supported Biden by 59 and 69 percent , exit polls from Tuesday show that 55 percent of Latino men voted for Trump. Latino women still overwhelmingly supported Harris, but by 6 percentage points less than they had in 2020.\n\nLatino voters in Reading are reachable - Democrats just haven't put in the work, Reading's first Latino mayor, Eddie Morán, told Politico Magazine earlier this month. Morán won his 2019 primary against a Democratic incumbent by doing one thing: talking to Latino voters in neighborhoods Democrats had forgotten.\n\nDemocratic outreach to Latinos happened largely with the help of groups like Make the Road Action PA, which focuses on engaging Black and brown voters. The group knocked on more than 560,000 doors, made contact with 50,000 voters in eight counties, and had 413,000 conversations with Latino voters across the state.\n\n\"In Pennsylvania, the minimum wage hasn't gone up in 20+ years.\"\n\nIssues like the cost of living and housing were prominent across those conversations, said Diana Robinson, co-deputy director of Make the Road Action Pennsylvania. \"The rent is too high, people are struggling to pay their bills. That is something we think is unifying to folks across the board,\" she said. \"In Pennsylvania, the minimum wage hasn't gone up in 20+plus years.\"\n\nKandice Cabeza, a Harris voter in Northeast Philadelphia, said she came out to support the right to abortion but was not thrilled about either candidate. She's originally from Baltimore but has lived in Philadelphia for 10 years.\n\n\"What are you doing for the people? What's changing with the cost of living, food, medical assistance, and things like that, medical bills? All those things matter too,\" Cabeza said. \"I really haven't heard much about that from neither one of them. They're kind of feuding over who's gonna be number one. But what about us? It's kind of like, fingers crossed that someone looks out for all of us and not just a certain group.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nIndependent groups are doing the work of courting working-class voters that the Democratic Party has stopped trying to reach, said WFP's Mitchell. \"It isn't necessarily drifting to the right in the way that some political pundits talk about it. Our approach is to take seriously meeting working-class people where they're at.\"\n\nThe working class is incredibly diverse, but a core set of issues unifies working people across ideology, Mitchell said. Three Working Families Party candidates flipped House seats in New York, where Democratic losses in the 2022 cycle cost the party the House. John Avlon and former Rep. Mondaire Jones , both Democratic candidates in New York who pivoted to the center, lost in swing districts. Rep. Pat Ryan , D-N.Y., faced an AIPAC-backed Republican challenger in the Catskills and the mid-Hudson Valley. Ryan campaigned alongside progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., in October. He won by 1 percentage point.\n\n\"Basically, it's class war, right? There's a reason why Democrats sometimes talk about taxing billionaires. Because it's hugely popular. We just think they need to say that a lot more,\" Mitchell said. \"This group of working-class voters of all races that have either dropped out of politics in general and are hugely skeptical of politics, or are looking for other politics and are finding populist politics, and sometimes that brings them to the populist right.\"\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-V.T., blamed Harris's loss on the party's neglect of working-class voters. \"It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working people would find that the working class has abandoned them. First, it was the white working class, and now it is Latino and Black workers as well,\" Sanders said. \"Will the big money interests and well-paid consultants who control the Democratic Party learn any real lessons from this disastrous campaign? Will they understand the pain and political alienation that tens of millions of Americans are experiencing? Do they have any ideas as to how we can take on the increasingly powerful Oligarchy which has so much economic and political power? Probably not.\"\n\nIt's unsurprising to see bumps in minority support for Trump, Mitchell explained. \"When Black people are showing up for Democrats, it isn't unbridled support and unquestioning support for a political party. It's a strategic move,\" he said. \"I want more Black voters asking questions and the political parties recognizing that there's a larger and larger component of the Black electorate that is persuadable.\"\n\nThe trends themselves aren't disturbing, Mitchell said. \"How you respond to those trends, I think, is critical. So if the Democratic Party doesn't take those trends seriously, then I think they would be in trouble. We're taking them seriously.\"\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "Swing-State Voters Disillusioned With Kamala Harris Can Swap for Two Non-Swing-State Votes\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nOrganizers are facilitating protest votes for people in swing states to register their dissent - without handing a victory to Donald Trump.\n\nSwing-state voters angered with the Biden administration's support for Israel's war on Gaza and hesitant to vote for Vice President Kamala Harris have a new way to register their dissent: swapping their vote with someone in a safely Democratic state.\n\nThe last-minute movement organized by Palestine solidarity protesters has attracted a shoutout from John Oliver and the support of thousands of frustrated voters including Democratic Georgia state Rep. Ruwa Romman, one of the Palestinian Americans who was denied a chance to address the Democratic National Convention in August.\n\nThe vote-swap movement comes as progressives across the country describe agonizing decisions over how to voice disapproval of the administration without inadvertently aiding Donald Trump. And, now, disaffected voters can get double their value, swapping one swing-state vote with Harris for two non-swing-state protest votes for another option, organizers said.\n\nRomman told The Intercept on Monday that, after initial skepticism, she saw the effort as an important option for \"people like me, who continue to be completely torn up about how to maneuver this election cycle as an ongoing genocide continues in Gaza.\"\n\nHere's how the practice works: Someone like Romman, in a state that is expected to have a razor-thin margin, casts their vote for Kamala Harris. Through the Swap Your Vote website , they are connected with a voter in a safely blue state, who agrees to cast a ballot for a third-party or write-in candidate as a protest against the administration's foreign policy.\n\nRomman said she cast her vote for Harris in Georgia, a decision she explained in a Rolling Stone op-ed , while pairing with voters in safe states. She left it up to them to decide who to back.\n\nRead our complete coverage\n\nThe website's organizers include Rae Abileah, a Jewish Voice for Peace member and former co-director of CODEPINK, who said the practice was inspired by efforts in past presidential elections.\n\nAbileah pointed to the 2000 presidential election, which Al Gore lost to George W. Bush by a few hundred votes in Florida. That margin was much smaller than the number of votes cast in Florida for Green Party candidate Ralph Nader.\n\n\"If more people had traded votes and voted for Nader in safe states, and voted for Gore in Florida, we would be living in a completely different reality,\" Abileah said.\n\nU.S. Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., was one of the first to propose organized vote swapping during the 2000 election, and the practice took off during the 2016 race .\n\nWhile the current vote-swapping effort is firmly directed at progressives, Abileah said some participants may be motivated by issues besides Gaza, including corporate influence over politics and the climate crisis.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThrough Monday, the effort had drawn the support of more than 8,000 voters, according to swapyourvote.org. Abileah said the site is now pairing one swing-state voter who casts their ballot for Harris with two voters in safe states who will cast ballots for someone else.\n\n\"The doubling is really to acknowledge the weight, the intensity, of having to cast this vote for Democrats at a time when our target audience is disillusioned and heartbroken,\" she said.\n\nOrganizers say the practice is legal. They point to a 2007 federal circuit court ruling that vote-swapping is protected by the First Amendment.\n\nAbileah acknowledged that there is no way for voters in swing states to ensure that their partners in safe states will follow through on their promises to vote for third-party or write-in candidates.\n\nThe Harris campaign has not endorsed the vote-swapping push, according to Abileah. She said that it has, however, drawn support from the Movement Voter PAC and other organizations.\n\nAbileah said the group of progressives backing the effort only began building a website on October 10 after it became clear that Harris would not break with Biden over the war.\n\n\"It just should never have been this hard. The majority of Democrats oppose what is happening, have done everything they could to push the party,\" Romman said. \"I really, really hope that come Tuesday, we can start planning on pushing the Harris administration on this.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Do Kamala Harris's Neocon Supporters Just Hate Trump, or Is There Something More to Her Appeal?\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nPersonally, I would not accept an endorsement from a world-historic war criminal.\n\nThe Iraq war - sold on lies and bungled in its prosecution - has become the embodiment of American hubris in the 21st century. Hundreds of thousands died, allies were alienated, and the U.S. became mired in a decadeslong boondoggle that is still unfolding. By 2007, a few years after the war was launched, all but its most diehard proponents had come to see it as the mistake it was.\n\nToday, those same diehard war hawks - the very people who planned and carried out the Iraq invasion - are proudly throwing their full support behind Vice President Kamala Harris in the November presidential election.\n\nChief among them is former Vice President Dick Cheney. Not far behind are a clutch of other Bush-era figures aligned with the neoconservative movement, like Bill Kristol; former officials like former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales ; and staffers for the late former Republican presidential nominee Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.\n\nHarris is, in turn, embracing her new right-wing fan club, touting endorsements from more than 200 Republican staffers who worked for George W. Bush, McCain, and another former Republican presidential nominee, Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah.\n\n\"Of course, we have plenty of honest, ideological disagreements with Vice President Harris,\" the GOP staffers wrote in a letter . \"That's to be expected. The alternative, however, is simply untenable.\"\n\nThese hawks say they're endorsing Harris largely to stop Donald Trump - citing his conduct and \"chaotic leadership\" - but these prominent conservatives are backing the Democratic nominee because their visions for U.S. foreign policy increasingly appear to be aligned. The Democratic and Republican parties are more unified than ever in their commitment to preserving American hegemony and preventing the multipolar world from emerging.\n\nAs vice president, Cheney was one of the principal architects not only of the Iraq War, which left hundreds of thousands of Iraqis dead, but also the U.S.'s worldwide torture regime. The aftershocks of America's eight-year occupation are still being felt in the region and in our domestic politics to this day. Former Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wy., who inherited her father's hawkish views, has also pledged to do whatever she can to elect Harris, including launching a PAC that has raised millions of dollars to boost the Democrat's campaign.\n\nThis marks a departure from the past 20 years of Democratic presidential campaigns, which were built on a repudiation of the Bush administration and its disastrous war in Iraq.\n\nJust 18 months after American troops went into Baghdad, the 2004 Democratic presidential nominee, John Kerry, said that the invasion created \"a crisis of historic proportions.\" He charged Bush with \"stubborn incompetence\" over his handling of the war. In 2008, Barack Obama's opposition to the unpopular war was a major source of his success at the ballot box.\n\nEven in 2016, the repercussions of the Iraq War were a major issue in the Democratic primary. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., made his opposition to the war a cornerstone of his platform and repeatedly referenced Hillary Clinton's vote in favor of it. \"I don't think you are qualified if you have voted for the disastrous war in Iraq,\" Sanders said of Clinton.\n\nNow, however, an endorsement from one of the biggest war criminals in recent history is seen as an asset, not a liability.\n\nThe Harris campaign isn't just courting moderates and conservatives as part of a short-term strategy to win the election. Rather, Democrats are actively supporting and spouting neoconservative ideas.\n\nDuring her keynote address at the Democratic National Convention, Harris vowed: \"As commander-in-chief, I will ensure America always has the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world\" - as her party blocked any Palestinian Americans from appearing on the convention stage to speak about Israel's genocidal war on Gaza.\n\nThe party's 2024 platform also reflects this rightward shift. A section from the 2020 platform on ending forever wars and opposing regime change was completely removed in 2024. The Democratic Party went from calling for an end to U.S. support for Saudi Arabia's brutal war in Yemen to championing the Biden administration's plan for a normalization deal between Israel and the Persian Gulf monarchy - a plan that could also put American lives on the line to protect the Saudi dictatorship for decades to come.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nSome of the most glaring neocon-coded changes in the platform have to do with Iran policy. This year's platform attempted to portray Trump as being too soft on Iran, while including no mention of the Trump administration's assassination of a top Iranian military commander. Though Harris's national security adviser, Phil Gordon, helped negotiate the 2015 Iran deal, others in her circle have predicted that a Harris administration would not seek to return to the Iran nuclear deal.\n\nIt's not like Trump offers a viable alternative. As recently as the debate this week, Harris and Trump tried to outflank each other on issues like China, immigration , and crime. Trump called Biden a \"very bad Palestinian\" who doesn't want to help Israel \"finish the job\" in Gaza. Both parties are guilty of China-bashing and casting China as an existential threat to the U.S. As president, Trump declared economic war on China, which was then escalated by Biden.\n\nThe American people don't support any of these bloodthirsty policies, but it appears that circles of power in the U.S. are increasingly disconnected from the will of the people. The vast majority of Americans who want the U.S. to pull back and focus on domestic issues are going to be left without any serious option in November. The country, and the world, will pay the price.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Israel's Invasion of Lebanon May Doom Kamala Harris's White House Chances\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nMichigan's Lebanese community is being asked to overcome its grief. That's a tall order.\n\nIn July, while playing golf with my dad in Michigan, a woman called out to me after seeing \"Deira\" printed in Arabic text on my shirt, a reference to the Al Deira Hotel, once a proud landmark in Gaza now reduced to rubble by Israeli forces.\n\nIt's worrisome to wear Arabic in public these days, but this club has members who hail from Israel's neighbors, including those of Lebanese, Palestinian, and Syrian descent.\n\n\"I'm from the West Bank!\" the woman yelled.\n\nI recognized her; her husband is Lebanese. She asked about my shirt, so I explained the story of the Al Deira Hotel. Her companion, a Syrian woman, chimed in: \"We lost 18 family members in the Orthodox Church bombing.\" I interjected that my cousin's cousin lost three children in that same bombing . She paused, then said, \"That's my cousin.\" We smiled, bittersweetly, realizing - as people of Arab heritage often do in Michigan - that we're likely distant relatives.\n\nThis wasn't in Dearborn. It was in Grand Rapids, which helped deliver the state to Joe Biden in 2020. My dad's family, like many in West Michigan, comes from Lebanon - though when my great-grandfather journeyed here, it was still Syria.\n\nOur family that remains in Lebanon dwells almost exclusively in the Bekaa Valley, a fertile oasis where vineyards and crops flourish, cradled between majestic peaks that stand sentinel near the Syrian border. This lush landscape has been their ancestral home for generations. It's also a Hezbollah stronghold, and today families like mine fear for their lives as Israeli bombs rain from the sky.\n\nUntil now, the story of Michigan's role in the election has centered on Arab Americans' profound discontent with the Democratic Party over Israel's relentless devastation of Gaza. The war has left deep emotional wounds.\n\nIsrael's recent military incursion into Lebanon feels like another twist of the knife, intensifying the sense of betrayal and alienation of one of the most critical voting constituencies in the country.\n\nKamala Harris's chances of winning the presidency will plummet if she loses Michigan, and current polling shows she and Donald Trump are neck and neck there.\n\nIn addition to about 9,000 Palestinian Americans , Michigan is home to roughly 82,000 Lebanese Americans - more than any other state. Considering that Hillary Clinton lost Michigan by fewer than 11,000 voters in 2016, Lebanese Michiganders could very well decide the 2024 election.\n\nCome November 5, I think we may look back on the weeks after Israel invaded Lebanon as the moment Harris lost significant ground in the race.\n\nAs I sat down to write this, I got a text from a family member back in Michigan, Reema Ghareeb: \"I just found out there was a strike three minutes from my cousin's house.\"\n\nShe was going to vote for Harris, but now she doesn't think she can.\n\n\"I'd never vote for Trump, he'd be worse,\" she said, \"but in light of what's happening in Lebanon I have no idea how I can vote for Harris.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nBiden's departure from the ticket in July sparked the belief among some Arab Americans that change was possible . When Israel responded to the October 7 attacks by invading Gaza last year, Harris was not the face of the Democratic Party. That distinction gave her a little wiggle room to decouple from Biden's decision to unconditionally back Israel.\n\nNow, with Harris leading the party and Israel bombing Lebanon with America's full support, that sense of distance has vanished .\n\nSince last month, Israel's assault in Lebanon has driven more than 1.2 million people from their homes and killed over 2,000. Twenty-two people were killed in a Beirut apartment building leveled by a U.S.-made bomb. Kamel Jawad, an American citizen from Michigan , who was caring for his mother, was among them.\n\nThe violence is deflating the hopes many projected on Harris, replacing them with a growing suspicion that she's just more of the same . Last week, the Arab American Political Action Committee, which is based in Michigan, announced that for the first time since its founding in 1998, it was refusing to issue a presidential endorsement because \"both candidates have endorsed genocide in Gaza and war in Lebanon.\"\n\n\"What's happening in Lebanon has made persuasion very difficult,\" said Nada Al-Hanooti, the national deputy organizing director for Emgage, a nonprofit focused on civic engagement for Arab Americans. Emgage endorsed Harris, believing that she would try to secure a ceasefire once in office, Al-Hanooti explained, but her ability to break with the president is tightly constrained right now. That nuance, Al-Hanooti conceded, wasn't resonating with Lebanese voters.\n\n\"There are some community members we've spoken to who are seeing the strategy and are voting on strategy,\" she said. \"But for many, it's very hard for them to see past their grief.\"\n\nBehind the scenes, Arab and Muslim leaders in Michigan implored Harris earlier this month to push for a ceasefire. She was reportedly sympathetic to their concerns, but the only thing voters noticed was that the administration backed away from its proposal for a ceasefire in Lebanon and instead endorsed Israel's invasion.\n\nArab Michiganders' anxieties are only further stoked by the sense of abandonment felt by Americans in Lebanon who try, and fail, to return home. After the October 7 attacks, the United States moved quickly to evacuate citizens from Israel. Navy vessels were dispatched, and flights were arranged to support their departure.\n\nBy contrast, the response to the 7,000 Americans in Lebanon who have reached out to the U.S. Embassy seeking evacuation guidance has been sluggish and disorganized. Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., shared a poignant video on Instagram , calling the situation a disgrace and expressing frustration that her staff has to \"beg\" for the administration's help to get her constituents home.\n\nWith the election so close, I have trouble grasping the Democrats' strategy. As I see it, the Biden administration isn't just neglecting the safety of these Americans but also risking the whole of Michigan, a critical battleground state, just weeks away from what it has deemed the most consequential election in modern American history.\n\nEveryone I know only wants for their families to be safe. Every Lebanese American has watched in horror this last year as Israel has bombed hospitals, apartment buildings, churches, bakeries, schools, United Nations centers, and refugee camps in Gaza , transforming a vibrant community into a graveyard of haunted rubble.\n\nThe U.S. has provided aid even as it continues to supply bombs. And now, with the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu threatening Lebanon with the same fate as Gaza - with no assurance from the Biden administration that it will try to intervene - what can the Lebanese diaspora do but heed his ominous words?\n\nIf Harris wants to secure Michigan, she must rekindle the hope that she can forge a different future for Lebanese families. That starts with offering Lebanese voters a glimmer of commitment to restrain Netanyahu. What the Harris campaign must understand is the deep-rooted connections that Michiganders have with Lebanon - lifelines that stretch through families, communities, churches, mosques, and tightly knit networks.\n\nOur grief isn't confined to war-torn enclaves but extends to suburban golf courses and family group chats. Right now, it feels like every casualty in Lebanon is costing Harris a vote. The grief breeds disillusionment and solidarity with our compatriots abroad and threatens to transform into silence at the ballot box.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Voters Overwhelmingly Chose to Protect Abortion - Even When They Didn't Choose Harris\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nIn every state it was on the ballot, reproductive care was more popular than Kamala Harris.\n\nIn every state where it was on the ballot on Tuesday, protecting abortion care received more votes than Vice President Kamala Harris. This was true regardless of whether the state ultimately went for Harris or for President-elect Donald Trump, and even in the three out of 10 states in which the abortion-related measure did not pass.\n\nVoters in seven states approved measures that would uphold or expand abortion rights: Arizona, Colorado, New York, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, and Nevada. Similar measures fell short in Florida, South Dakota, and Nebraska; the latter had two opposing abortion-related ballot measures: one to establish a right to abortion before viability, which failed, and one to ban abortion after the first-trimester, which passed.\n\nThe stark contrast between support for measures to protect bodily autonomy and support for Harris comes even as the vice president had made abortion a key part of her platform. In the final weeks of her campaign, she leaned even further into messaging around abortion, highlighting the cases of two Georgia women who died as a result of the state's abortion ban and heavily spending on ad buys on the issue.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nNina Smith, a Democratic strategist and former senior adviser to Stacey Abrams, argued that Republicans were able to effectively message to voters that the issue of abortion was being left to the states. In other words, it would be enough to vote to protect abortion rights within their own states, regardless of their vote for president, because Republicans weren't going to ban it nationally.\n\n\"I think a lot of people voted with a false sense of security,\" said Smith. \"Folks were betting that if they voted to enshrine abortion protections, Donald Trump wouldn't actually co-sign a national abortion ban. I think the GOP managed to convince a lot of women that security and economy are issues that are much more important and pertinent to them, and that they wouldn't dare pass a national ban.\"\n\nIn Montana, voters overwhelmingly moved to enshrine \"the right to make and carry out decisions about one's own pregnancy, including the right to abortion,\" into the state constitution. The amendment passed with over 57 percent of the vote. Trump won the state by similar margins, while Harris took 38 percent of the vote. Republicans also made inroads in the Senate in Montana last night, flipping Democratic Sen. Jon Tester's seat in favor of his Republican opponent, Tim Sheehy, who is staunchly anti-abortion.\n\nKeegan Nashan, a volunteer who worked with Montanans Securing Reproductive Rights, which campaigned for the amendment, said that Democrats have really struggled to connect with rural voters in the state, even if they might agree with them on issues like abortion.\n\n\"The Democrats in Montana have not done a good job engaging rural voters,\" said Nashan. \"It's not surprising to me at all that a lot of people voted for Trump because they feel entirely disenfranchised by the Democratic Party whether it's rational or not.\"\n\nNashan said she heard from voters who supported Republicans up and down the ballot and also voted in favor of the amendment that their choice came down to priorities. When it came to their presidential pick, Nashan recounted, voters ranked issues like the economy, immigration, and other social issues higher on their priority list. \"A lot of people were saying that groceries were cheaper under Trump, the economy was better under Trump,\" she said. \"And that abortion just isn't as important as some of the other issues that Trump has promised to have an answer to.\"\n\nThe state ballot measure on abortion gave those Montanans a chance to protect reproductive rights and also back the candidates they felt spoke to the other issues that matter to them.\n\nMontana is far from an anomaly. In Missouri, which became the first state to overturn a total abortion ban , nearly 52 percent of voters backed a constitutional amendment enshrining reproductive rights, while only 40 percent gave their vote to Harris.\n\nNevada , which voted to enshrine the right to an abortion in the state constitution, remains too close to call. However, the abortion measure garnered 63 percent of the vote, while Harris has 46 percent to Trump's 51 percent, with 93 percent of the vote counted by Wednesday afternoon.\n\nEven in New York , which Harris won with 55 percent of the vote, she underperformed in comparison to the abortion-related amendment, which got 62 percent support. (Harris also significantly underperformed recent Democratic presidential candidates in the state.) The New York measure added language to the state Bill of Rights prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex, including \"sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and reproductive healthcare and autonomy.\" (The right to an abortion already exists in the state constitution.)\n\nHarris also got fewer votes than the abortion rights ballot amendments in two other states she carried: Colorado and Maryland. In Colorado, she won 54 percent of the vote, while the ballot measure won 61 percent. And in Maryland, she won nearly 60 percent of the vote, while the measure passed with 74 percent support.\n\nIn Arizona, Trump was ahead with nearly 52 percent of the vote as of Wednesday afternoon, with Harris at 47 percent, with only 63 percent of the vote counted. Arizona's abortion ballot measure enshrining the \"fundamental right to abortion\" in the state's constitution, on the other hand, passed handily with 61 percent of the vote.\n\nEven in states where the abortion rights measures failed to pass, they still outperformed Harris. In Florida, a ballot measure on abortion was backed by a majority of voters (57 percent) but still didn't pass because of the state's 60-percent threshold for constitutional amendments. The measure significantly outperformed Harris, who earned 42.9 percent of the vote. In South Dakota, Harris won roughly 34 percent of the vote, while a ballot measure on abortion received 41 percent. And in Nebraska, Harris received 38 percent of the vote, while the pro-abortion rights ballot measure received nearly 49 percent.\n\nFor Nashan, the Montana volunteer, Democrats need to work harder to reach voters the party hasn't traditionally courted if it hopes to see its candidates get the same level of support as the issues they are running on. \"All I can hope is that the Democratic Party becomes a bit better at communicating and consistently communicating with rural voters,\" she said, \"meet them at their table where they're at and have some conversations because we have way more in common values-wise. We are much more aligned than we are different.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "In Dearborn, Rashida Tlaib Did Nearly Twice as Well as Kamala Harris\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nHarris refused to distance herself from the Biden administration's support of Israel's war on Gaza. Tlaib railed against it.\n\nVoters in the biggest U.S. city with an Arab-majority population shifted decisively toward Donald Trump on Tuesday, in a stinging rebuke of the Biden administration's policies in the Middle East.\n\nTrump claimed 43 percent of the vote in Dearborn, Michigan, to Kamala Harris's 36 percent. Jill Stein claimed 15 percent of the vote in the city, where the Green Party had notched less than 1 percent in 2020.\n\nTrump's margin of victory in Dearborn represents a massive reversal from the 2020 election, when Joe Biden's won 69 percent to Trump's 30.\n\nThe huge shift toward Trump will not be decisive in a race where he cruised to a Electoral College victory without the help of Michigan, the state with the highest percentage of Arab Americans. The state had yet to be called Wednesday morning. Still, it was a telling sign of how completely the administration has lost Arab Americans over the war.\n\nDown-ballot results suggest that the move was motivated in large part by anger toward the Biden administration rather than dissatisfaction with Democratic policies overall.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a progressive Palestinian American, won 62 percent of the vote in Dearborn compared to Republican candidate James Hooper's 30 percent. She was easily reelected to a fourth term.\n\nFor observers, the contrast between Tlaib's strong performance and Harris's weakness is striking.\n\n\"Working class voters across this country no longer see the Democratic Party as a Party that fights for their interests,\" said Usamah Andrabi, the communications director of Justice Democrats, \"and they saw Rashida Tlaib as someone who does for the very reason that she bucked her Party's leadership, because she refused to ignore the needs of her constituents - which in this case meant opposing a genocide.\"\n\n\"That's what putting democracy back at the center of the Democratic Party looks like,\" Andrabi said. \"Anything else is a betrayal to everyday people and they feel it.\"\n\nSome Arab and Muslim voters in Michigan had gone over to Trump because of their conservative values and culture-war alignment. A nationwide ad campaign attacked Harris for her support of trans people, often using misinformation, and the tack had been successful. The issue had helped Trump peel Arab and Muslim voters away from Democrats .\n\nTlaib, though, took progressive stands on the issue, vocally supporting trans rights.\n\nSo what made Harris perform so poorly in comparison to Tlaib? One lightning rod stands out: Tlaib, a Palestinian American, has been one of the most vocal critics in Congress of Israel's war on Gaza and, more recently, Lebanon.\n\nOne prominent Lebanese American civic leader in Dearborn, Abed Hammoud, said he saw no contradiction in Trump and Tlaib - a social progressive - both winning the city because the election was a clear referendum on Israel's assault against Gaza.\n\n\"Even though social issues were there, a huge focus was on the Middle East and the war,\" he said.\n\nThe unofficial results for Dearborn track with The Intercept's reporting on Arab and Muslim residents of Michigan during early voting. Many said they were lifelong Democrats who were turning to Trump out of a sense of dismay over the war in Gaza and the invasion of Lebanon.\n\nTrump has promised to let Israel \"finish the job\" in Gaza and supported inflammatory pro-Israel policies such as recognizing Jerusalem as its capital . Still, some voters said they wanted to give him a chance after more than a year of devastating war in Gaza - and in light of Harris's refusal to break with Biden on the issue.\n\nIn a statement, Nihad Awad, the national executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said the huge shift of votes to Trump could be attributed to Harris's failure to take a stronger position on Gaza.\n\n\"Rather than listening to the clear majority of American who support both a ceasefire and a suspension of weapons to Israel, Vice President Harris only struck a slightly more sympathetic tone toward Palestinians while sticking with the substance of President Biden's disastrous stance,\" said Awad. \"This led to an unprecedented shift of support from Muslim, Arab, and other communities who traditionally vote for Democratic presidents.\"\n\nTrump campaigned aggressively for the Arab and Muslim vote in Michigan, paying several visits in the race's final weeks to Hamtramck, which has an all-Muslim city council, and Dearborn. Trump cast himself as the peace candidate, and Awad called on him to follow through.\n\n\"The president-elect should fulfill his campaign pledge to pursue peace abroad, including by ending the war on Gaza. However, this must be a real peace based on justice, freedom, and a state for the Palestinian people,\" Awad said.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nDearborn was a center of the national \"Uncommitted\" movement , which sought to push the administration to shift its policies toward Israel. Harris rejected Uncommitted's campaign to have a Palestinian American speaker address the Democratic National Convention in August.\n\nDavid Dulio, a professor at Oakland University in Michigan, said that given such activism in the area, Trump's overperformance was not entirely surprising.\n\n\"We have known this has been a possibility for months going all the way back to the presidential primary when Uncommitted gets 100,00 votes statewide,\" Dulio said. \"We knew that this was a point of contention in these three Arab American communities. We knew that many people in those communities were not and are not happy with the current administration's policy with respect to Israel and the war in Gaza.\"\n\nSpeaking at a press conference Wednesday, Uncommitted movement co-founder Abbas Alawieh said the people voting for Trump included his own family members.\n\n\"Folks who voted for Trump are my cousins, my friends, people who were tasked with a very difficult task of carrying a lot of grief, and trying to do a politically savvy thing at the same time,\" Alawieh said. \"It's a very hard thing to do.\"\n\nRead our complete coverage\n\nAlawieh said he hoped the \"gamble\" of voting for Trump in an attempt to end the war will pay off, but he expected members of his movement to be organizing in the streets to pressure politicians of both major parties.\n\n\"It's going to be a tough road,\" he said. \"And for a lot of us, our activism, our organizing, might even be criminalized. And that's a very grim prospect, but we've got to get going.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "After Major Industry Donor Pops Up, Harris Makes Bizarre Proposal: Crypto for Black Men\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nLosing Black voters to Donald Trump, the Harris campaign has an idea for helping Black men. But what does it mean?\n\nDays after a leading crypto industry figure endorsed her, Vice President Kamala Harris gave cryptocurrencies a vague embrace this week - as part of a pitch to Black men.\n\nAlong with a pledge to legalize weed, the policy document released by Harris's campaign Monday made a bid for Black men's votes with ambiguous wording about regulating crypto. The move left industry critics wondering whether she backs strong or weak safeguards at a time when the industry is pouring money into political races.\n\nWhile the crypto industry has spread its money around - spending more than $200 million on the congressional campaigns of friendly candidates from both parties - leading crypto figures have mostly backed former President Donald Trump. The preference is largely seen as a rebuke of the Biden administration's willingness to regulate the scandal-plagued sector.\n\nCrypto skeptics were divided on how to interpret Harris's comments, with one saying that they seemed to be aimed as much at donors as voters.\n\n\"What she is doing is reflecting the will of some of her funders,\" said Jared Ball, a professor of communication and Africana/Black studies at Morgan State University, \"which is to get some policy support to give engagement in crypto trading more legitimacy, which is just going to help fleece more people.\"\n\nSince entering the race in July, Harris has courted business leaders who took a dour view of the Biden administration thanks to its enforcement of antitrust and securities laws.\n\nThat cohort includes the Silicon Valley venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, who announced their support for Trump days before Biden dropped out of the race. Their firm Andreessen Horowitz has invested billions of dollars in cryptocurrency, moves that coincided with scrutiny of crypto by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nOnce a critic, Trump has turned into a crypto booster since launching his campaign. At a crypto conference in July, Trump said the industry's regulations would be \"written by people who love your industry, not hate your industry.\" More recently, he's been shilling a cryptocurrency of his own .\n\nHarris has been far more circumspect. Behind the scenes, however, she has engaged with industry insiders.\n\nIn an October 4 post on X , Horowitz, a longtime friend of Harris's, said he had had \"several conversations\" with Harris and her advisers. Saying he was \"encouraged\" by the discussions, Horowitz announced that he was making a large donation to the Harris campaign.\n\n\"As we stated earlier, the Biden Administration has been exceptionally destructive on tech policy across the industry, but especially as it relates to Crypto/Blockchain and AI,\" Horowitz said. \"So, while I am very hopeful that the Harris Administration will be much better, they have not yet stated their intentions.\"\n\nHarris had already made some encouraging comments about cryptocurrencies before Horowitz made his tweet. Within two weeks of their meeting coming to light, however, she rolled out her most direct statement on the issue in a policy paper on helping Black men.\n\nLosing ground among Black men to Trump in the polls, Harris has ramped up her direct appeals. Her nine-page \" Opportunity Agenda for Black Men \" included conventional-sounding ideas, such as $20,000 forgivable loans for entrepreneurs and expanded apprenticeship programs.\n\nThe most attention-grabbing sections, however, called for legalizing recreational marijuana and, finally, making it easier for Black men who own crypto \"to benefit from financial innovation.\"\n\nThe paper said that Harris \"will make sure owners of and investors in digital assets benefit from a regulatory framework so that Black men and others who participate in this market are protected.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nSurveys suggest that Black Americans, wary or shut out of traditional financial institutions, have invested in cryptocurrencies at higher rates than other Americans . Critics say that has left Black people more vulnerable to fluctuations in the volatile crypto market.\n\nSince releasing the policy document, Harris has not elaborated on what sort of \"regulatory framework\" she would like to see. Rick Claypool, the research director for Public Citizen's president's office, said the statement was \"a bit of a Rorschach.\"\n\nThe industry has long said that it supports regulations, just weak ones enforced by the short-staffed Commodity Futures Trading Commission . Meanwhile, critics who liken the industry to a giant Ponzi scheme say that existing regulations enforced by the SEC are appropriate.\n\nMark Hays, a senior policy analyst with Americans for Financial Reform and Demand Progress, said his \"overarching concern\" was that the industry would secure lax oversight under the guise of regulatory clarity: \"a wolf in sheep's clothing thing.\"\n\nThe Harris campaign did not comment on whether she supports regulation under the CFTC or the SEC.\n\nLeaving aside that question, Ball, the Morgan State professor, said his larger concern was the document's suggestion that \"Black capitalism\" could close the racial wealth gap.\n\n\"The specific role that crypto has played in this discussion has just been to refurbish those old claims and give them new packaging,\" Ball said.\n\nStill, at least one industry critic said he saw signs for hope in the Harris campaign document.\n\n\"I have written that no one should be in crypto,\" said Algernon Austin, the director for race and economic justice at the Center for Economic and Policy Research. \"But given that people are, definitely more regulation, more transparency, more safeguards would be an improvement.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Kamala Harris Has Finally Promised to Tax the Rich\n\nKamala Harris delivers remarks at a campaign rally in Madison, Wisconsin. Daniel DeSlover/Zuma\n\nKamala Harris is starting to respond to calls by media outlets and voters to share a detailed economic policy plan ahead of November, including making billionaires \"pay their fair share.\"\n\nHarris delivered a speech to the Economic Club of Pittsburgh on Wednesday, along with the release of a policy book that lays out her strategy to lower costs and \"create an opportunity economy\" for the middle class.\n\nIn Pittsburgh, Harris attempted the delicate balance of reaching out to undecided voters while also appealing to those already excited by her campaign as she replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee.\n\n\"I believe we shouldn't be constrained by ideology, and instead should seek practical solutions to problems,\" Harris said. \"Part of being pragmatic means taking good ideas from wherever they come.\"\n\nThe result was a speech that didn't do much to elaborate on policy, instead seeking to avoid language or commitments that could reinforce Republicans' description of Harris as a \" Marxist .\"\n\nBut the 82-page document, \"A New Way Forward for the Middle Class,\" gets into some of those details, including \"making the wealthiest Americans play by the same rules as the middle class.\"\n\nTo do this, Harris proposes a minimum income tax for billionaires-at an amount yet to be disclosed-and \"commonsense tax reforms for corporations.\"\n\nThe policy guide cites the federal budget for fiscal year 2025-according to which Donald Trump's 2017 tax breaks brought effective corporate tax rates to less than 10 percent-and a study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nongovernmental think tank, that found that large companies didn't pass the profits from those cuts to workers or into other investments.\n\nHarris states that she will raise the corporate tax rate to 28 percent-notably still less than the 35 percent rate for the richest companies that was in place from 1993 until Trump's 2017 cuts. In the document, the vice president emphasized the difference with Trump's tax policy, which by 2020 allowed at least 55 of the largest American corporations to pay no federal income tax and to make $3.5 billion in rebates.\n\nVoters remain concerned about economic policy. According to a September poll conducted by the New York Times and Siena College among undecided voters in Arizona, Georgia, and North Carolina, about one in eight said Harris' handling of the economy was their most pressing concern. What her latest economic strategy means for such voters remains to be seen.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Harris Was Asked About Helping Undocumented People. Her Answer Was Mostly About a Border Crackdown.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris listens to a question from Ivett Castillo. Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n\nAt a town hall organized by Univision on Thursday night, Vice President Kamala Harris addressed a key constituency eluding the Democratic Party: Latino voters. Her pitch, like much of the campaign, focused on the contrast between her and Donald Trump. \"I very much believe that the American people are being presented with two very different visions for our country,\" she said.\n\nStill, Harris mostly fronted a \"tough on the border\" position during the appearance. After moments of empathy and a brief mention of fighting for DACA recipients, Harris touted a now-defunct restrictive border bill pushed by President Joe Biden that overlooked groups like the Dreamers . The vice president talked concrete on crackdown and vaguely on policies to help immigrants. She had a chance to be specific on both counts.\n\nOne of the first questions Harris fielded came from Ivett Castillo, the grieving daughter of an undocumented Mexican-born woman who had passed away six weeks prior. \"You and I have something in common,\" Castillo told Harris. \"We both lost our mother.\"\n\nCastillo, who lives in Las Vegas, went on to describe how she had been able to help her father get legal status, but not her mother. \"She was never ever able to get the type of care and service that she needed or deserved,\" Castillo said, sobbing. \"So my question for you is: What are your plans or do you have plans to support that subgroup of immigrants who have been here their whole lives, or most of them, and have to live and die in the shadows?\"\n\nHarris' choice to weave in border security in a question specifically about undocumented immigrants living in the interior of the United States-and to frame it as a problem to be fixed-shows how far to the right Democrats have come on immigration.\n\nHarris expressed sympathy for Castillo and urged her to remember her mother as she had lived. And she also mentioned a bill that the Biden administration proposed to offer a path to citizenship for some undocumented immigrants. (Harris blamed the fact that it wasn't picked up by Congress on the \"inability to put solutions in front of politics.\")\n\nBut that was the extent of Harris' answer to the question about her policies for the 11 million undocumented people living in the United States . Instead, the Democratic nominee quickly pivoted to the one piece of the immigration debate both parties seem to be laser-focused on exploiting this election cycle: the border .\n\n\"A bipartisan group of members of Congress, including one of the most conservative members of the United States Senate, came together with one of the strongest border security bills we've had in decades ,\" she said, noting how it would have boosted the border patrol force and help tackle the flow of fentanyl. (The vast majority of fentanyl is brought into the country through ports of entry by US citizens, not immigrants.) Harris then accused her opponent of deliberately killing the proposed legislation in order to keep the border a salient electoral issue. \"He would prefer to run on a problem than fixing a problem,\" she said.\n\nHarris' choice to weave in border security in a question specifically about longtime undocumented immigrants living in the interior of the United States-and to frame it as a problem to be fixed-shows how far to the right Democrats have come on immigration.\n\nIn fully embracing the perception that immigration can't be anything other than a liability for Democrats and a winning trampoline for Republicans, the party has all but ceded the \"moral leadership\" President Joe Biden so vehemently vowed to reclaim in the aftermath of Trump's devastation.\n\nBut if Harris' goal was to underscore the differences between her and Trump's views and policies on immigration, she missed an opportunity to do so. The Univision audience at the town hall and watching from home heard nothing about the Biden administration's move to make it easier for undocumented spouses of US citizens to obtain legal status. Nor did they hear about the Republican candidate's disastrous plans to arrest, detain, and mass deport millions of undocumented immigrants, tearing up families and ruining critical industries.\n\nSome polls suggest stricter border enforcement and, to a lesser extent, Trump's mass deportation proposal resonates with some Latinos. Even if experts say such plans could impact not only undocumented immigrants, but also mixed-status families and those with legal status. The message may not have caught on. In part, because it seems the campaign has done little to explain the potential catastrophe wrought by mass deportation. (As the New York Times reported , many have not heard about the details of the actual agenda.)\n\nIt's not surprising that Harris has adopted a defensive stance on immigration. From the beginning of her expedited presidential campaign, the former prosecutor has been facing attacks from Republicans falsely dubbing her the \" border czar .\"\n\nBut Harris was also once an unapologetically vocal supporter of undocumented immigrants. When vying for the Democratic nomination ahead of the 2020 election, she released a plan to use executive action to provide a pathway to citizenship to millions of Dreamers. Now, her official platform and rally speeches default to a boilerplate appearance of compromise in the form of \"strong border security and an earned pathway to citizenship.\"\n\nIt's not for a lack of emotion. Harris, like Biden, seems to thrive when relating to people and their struggles. \"It's about the dignity of people,\" she said at the town hall. \"And about the importance of doing what we can as leaders to alleviate suffering... What I think it's backward in terms of this thinking that it's a sign of strength to beat people down, part of the backward nature of those kinds of thinking is to suggest that empathy is somehow a weakness. Empathy meaning to have some level of care and concern about the suffering of other people and then do something to lift that up.\" She later added: \"There' a big contrast between me and Donald Trump.\"\n\nIf there was ever a moment to highlight what New Yorker 's Jonathan Blitzer aptly put as \"Trump's dangerous immigration obsession\" and what's at stake-beyond the more abstract warnings about a threat to democracy and the rule of law-that would have been it. If more people understood what mass deportation really means, maybe a quarter of Democrats would not support it .\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Five Men Were Executed in a Week. Why Is Kamala Harris Suddenly Silent on the Death Penalty?\n\nSt. Louis Post-Dispatch via AP\n\nFreddie \" Khalil\" Owens. Marcellus \" Khaliifah\" Williams. Emmanuel Littlejohn. Travis Mullis. Alan Eugene Miller.\n\nAll five men were executed within one week in five different states, a period political scientist Austin Sarat condemned as \"the worst execution spree in three decades.\"\n\nThe most high-profile execution took place on Tuesday when Missouri executed Marcellus Williams, who had maintained his innocence for decades. The execution was carried out despite the prosecutor's office in the 1998 murder trial acknowledging that evidence had been mishandled and therefore urged for the conviction to be vacated. The execution of Miller in Alabama also received intense media attention this week over the state's use of nitrogen gas, a method many have likened to torture .\n\nThe five executions once again thrust the issue of capital punishment, long criticized as unjust and unconstitutional , back into the public discourse, with advocates against the death penalty calling for a national reckoning. Many recalled studies that have repeatedly shown that people of color, and primarily those with intellectual disabilities, are far more likely to be given death sentences-despite little evidence that the punishment works to deter crime .\n\n\"It's the growing perception that the death penalty system in the United States is broken in its operation.\"\n\n\"The United States is in the midst of a national reconsideration of capital punishment in a way that was completely unforeseeable,\" Sarat told me during a phone call this week.\n\n\"What is driving this national reconsideration? It isn't sudden moral conversions of people who are supporters of the death penalty. It's the growing perception that the death penalty system in the United States is broken in its operation.\"\n\nBut amid the extraordinary string of executions this week, Vice President Kamala Harris has remained curiously silent on the issue of state-sanctioned violence and the death penalty. For some, the apparent silence is out of step with Harris' deep history of opposing the death penalty , which includes her promise as San Francisco's district attorney never to charge someone with the death penalty. She also campaigned on the promise to establish a federal ban when she first ran for president in 2019.\n\nYet, with the 2024 presidential election in a virtual tie-and familiar Republican attacks that she is soft on crime-Harris' platform appears to have wiped out any mention of her stance regarding capital punishment. When reached for comment by Mother Jones , Harris' press team did not respond.\n\nSarat said that any reluctance on behalf of Harris to weigh in on the issue, even with the extraordinarily high number of executions that took place this week, could reflect a change in the political climate from four years ago.\n\n\"The political landscape was different in 2020,\" says Sarat. \"That campaign unfolded in anticipation of and after the murder of George Floyd and the recognition of the need to address grave racial inequities.\"\n\nHe added: \"Abolitionists surely want Kamala Harris to speak out against the death penalty, but they want something more. They wanted her to be elected president United States so she can actually do something about the death penalty.\"\n\nCorrection, September 27: This post has been updated to reflect more precisely Austin Sarat's historical observation about execution sprees.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Kamala Harris Framed Climate Action as a Patriotic Duty. New Research Shows Why That's Effective.\n\nKyle Mazza/Anadolu/Getty Images/Grist\n\nThis story was originally published by Grist and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration .\n\n\"Freedom\" is often a Republican talking point, but Vice President Kamala Harris is trying to reclaim the concept for Democrats as part of her campaign for the presidency. In a speech at the Democratic National Convention last month, she declared that \"fundamental freedoms\" were at stake in the November election, including \"the freedom to breathe clean air and drink clean water and live free from the pollution that fuels the climate crisis.\"\n\nA new study suggests Harris might be onto something if she's trying to convince voters torn between her and former President Donald Trump. Researchers at New York University found that framing climate action as patriotic and as necessary to preserve the American \"way of life\" can increase support for climate action among people across the political spectrum in the United States.\n\n\"It's encouraging to see politicians adopting this type of language,\" said Katherine Mason, a co-author of the study and a psychology researcher at New York University. Based on the study's results, she said that this rhetoric \"may bridge political divides about climate change.\"\n\nSome 70 percent of Americans already support the government taking action to address climate change, including most younger Republicans, according to a poll from CBS News earlier this year. Experts have long suggested that appealing to Americans' sense of patriotism could activate them.\n\nThe framing has taken shape under President Joe Biden's administration, which has pushed for policies to manufacture electric vehicles and chargers domestically \" so that the great American road trip can be electrified .\" Harris underscored this approach to climate and energy in Tuesday's presidential debate with Trump, emphasizing efforts to craft \"American-made\" EVs and turning a question about fracking into a call for less reliance on \"foreign oil.\"\n\nMason's new study , published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , is the largest to date on the effects of patriotic language around climate change, with almost 60,000 participants across 63 countries. Americans read a message declaring that being pro-environment would help \"keep the United States as it should be,\" arguing that it was \"patriotic to conserve the country's natural resources.\"\n\nThe text was illustrated by photos of the American flag blowing in the wind, picturesque national parks, and climate-related impacts, such as a flooded Houston after Hurricane Harvey and a Golden Gate Bridge shrouded in an orange haze of wildfire smoke. Reading it increased people's level of belief in climate change, their willingness to share information about climate change on social media, and their support for policies to protect the environment, such as raising carbon taxes and expanding public transit.\n\nThe researchers wanted to test a psychological theory that people often defend the status quo, even if it's flawed, because they want stability, not uncertainty and conflict. \"This mindset presents a major barrier when it comes to tackling big problems like climate change, as it leads people to downplay the problem and resist necessary changes to protect the environment,\" Mason said.\n\nFor decades, environmental advocates have called on people to make sacrifices for the greater good-to bike instead of drive, eat more vegetables instead of meat, and turn down the thermostat in the winter. Asking people to give up things can lead to backlash, said Emma Frances Bloomfield, a communication professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. The framing in the study flips that on its head, she said. \"It's not asking people to sacrifice or make radical changes, but in fact, doing things for the environment will prevent the radical change of the environmental catastrophe.\"\n\n\"Patriotism or any kind of framing message, I think, can definitely backfire if it's not seen as an authentic connection on values.\"\n\nBloomfield, who has studied how to find common ground with conservatives on climate change, wasn't surprised the study found that appealing to patriotism worked in the United States. In other countries, however, the results were less clear-the patriotic language saw some positive effects in Brazil, France, and Israel, but backfired in other countries, including Germany, Belgium, and Russia.\n\nBloomfield urged caution in deploying this strategy in the real world, since it could come across as trying to manipulate conservatives by pandering to them. \"Patriotism or any kind of framing message, I think, can definitely backfire if it's not seen as an authentic connection on values,\" she said.\n\nTalking about a global environmental problem in an overly patriotic, competitive way could be another pitfall. Earlier this year, a study in the journal Environmental Communication found that a \"green nationalist\" framing-which pits countries against one another in terms of environmental progress-reduced people's support for policies to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Natalia Bogado, the author of that study and a psychology researcher in Germany, said that the new study in PNAS makes \"no reference to the key characteristics of nationalism, but only briefly mentions a patriotic duty,\" which might partly explain the different results.\n\nIf executed smartly, though, appealing to regional loyalty can lead to support for environmental causes. Take the \"Don't Mess With Texas\" campaign, started in the late 1980s to reduce litter along the state's highways. Its target was the young men casually chucking beer cans out their truck windows, believing littering was a \" God-given right .\" Instead of challenging their identity, the campaign channeled their Texas pride, with stunning results: Litter on the roads plunged 72 percent in just four years. Today, the phrase has become synonymous with Texas swagger -so much so that many have forgotten it was initially an anti-litter message.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Kamala Harris Has Great Health Vitals, Says Her Doc. We Still Don't Know About Trump.\n\nCarol Guzy/ZUMA\n\nVice President Kamala Harris had an appendectomy when she was three. She is up-to-date on preventative care screenings, like colonoscopies and mammograms. She has managed seasonal allergies and sporadic skin reactions with a nasal spray and Claritin, and she treats mild nearsightedness with contact lenses. At her most recent physical in April, Harris had a normal blood pressure reading of 128/74 mmHg; her heart rate was a healthy 78 beats per minute.\n\nThese findings are \"unremarkable,\" as her physician, Dr. Joshua Simmons put it in a memo the White House released Saturday. In another words: normal. As is the practice of a presidential candidate allowing their personal health information be made available to the public.\n\nTrump said he would \"very gladly\" share his recent medical information publicly, but has not yet done so.\n\nDonald Trump, who at 78 is nearly 20 years older than Harris, hasn't been nearly as forthcoming. In August, he told CBS News he would \"very gladly\" share his recent medical information publicly, but has not yet done so. The last time he released substantive details about his health was nearly seven years ago, at which point a memo from his physician said he had high cholesterol, a benign skin condition called rosacea, and was \"overweight,\" as measured by the standardized Body Mass Index (BMI) scale. The next year, the President released more limited health vitals that tipped the scale into the BMI category of \"obese,\" which correlates with a higher risk of heart disease and type-2 diabetes.\n\nWhen Trump's ear was injured in an assassination attempt over the summer, his campaign did not release medical records or provide a briefing. The most recent documentation of any sorts is from late 2023, at which point Trump shared a three-paragraph letter from his physician on Truth Social, stating his physical exams were \"well within the normal range and his cognitive exams were exceptional.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time he's obfuscated his physical health. In 2020, when Trump was hospitalized with Covid, his administration insisted he was on an \"upswing.\" The New York Times later reported that he was much sicker than his inner circle had let on: His blood oxygen levels had dropped to dangerous levels, the Times said, and officials worried he might have needed to be put on a ventilator.\n\nTrump's late physician, Dr. Harold N. Bornstein, said in 2015 that Trump would be \"the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.\"\n\nToday, that part is unlikely-especially without medical proof to back it up. But since Joe Biden dropped out of the race, former president Trump now claims a different superlative: oldest-ever presidential nominee.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "\"Kamala Harris for the People\": Veep Vows to Defeat \"Deeply Unserious\" Trump\n\nKamala Harris speaks at the 2024 Democratic National Convention Brandon Bell/Getty\n\nVice President Kamala Harris accepted the Democratic party's nomination for president on Thursday night in Chicago. It was a historic moment for the country and for Harris, who is now the first Black woman and first Asian-American to earn a major party nomination for president. In the most important speech of her political life, Harris didn't linger in the applause-which lasted several minutes. \"Let's get to business!\" she said, turning to her speech.\n\nIn only a month after President Joe Biden stepped down and named her as his heir apparent, Harris now leads a campaign that's been awash in energy-and cash. On the first night of the convention, Biden spoke, signaling a generational shift in Democratic party leadership. Over each passing day, while party luminaries gave Biden his political roses, it was clear that one generation was passing the torch to the next. That sentiment was also captured in a recurring chant throughout the week: \"We won't go back!\"\n\n\"I believe everyone has a right to safety, dignity, and justice,\" Harris said in her speech, noting that in her legal and political career, she has only had one client: The people.\n\nYes, there's been a momentous vibe shift, but there's a shift in policies, too. Democrats have effectively reframed the conversation about \"freedom\" that was once the mantra for the GOP. It's no longer just about the freedom to carry guns, as Trump's MAGA movement has talked about in recent years, or the \"freedom\" to take books out of libraries. Now, as my colleague Pema Levy noted, Democrats are operating from \"the idea that freedom is found in the preconditions of opportunity.\" People should be free to decide when and how to start families, access reproductive and gender-affirming health care, and find a decent job that pays a living wage. Throughout the week \"normal people\" touched by these issues spoke to the convention crowd and to millions across the country.\n\nAt the center of it all was Harris, not a newcomer to the national stage but still relatively unknown to most Americans. As a politician, since her first campaigns for District Attorney in San Francisco, Harris has been notoriously discreet about her private life. But this week we learned more about her personal and professional history than ever before. We learned from her beloved little sister about the brutal sexual assault and human trafficking cases that she prosecuted early on in her career. We learned from her husband, step-children, and brother-in-law about her blended family. We learned from her nieces, Amara and Leela, how to properly announce their auntie's name: \"comma-la!,\" they led the crowd in chanting.\n\nThis wasn't her first time in the spotlight at the DNC. In 2012, she earned a prime speaking spot as Attorney General of California. Back then she called the race between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney \"a choice between an America where opportunity is open to everyone\" and \"a philosophy that tilts the playing field to help the wealthiest few.\" That comparison now seems almost quaint in retrospect with Donald Trump vying for a second term in office, who Harris called \"a deeply unserious man.\"\n\n\"The consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White House are extremely serious , \" she said. But Harris is undaunted by the challenge. \"From the courthouse to the White House,\" she said, fighting for the people \"has been my life's work.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Harris' Embrace of Dick Cheney Was Just One Way She Courted National Security Hawks\n\nJeremy Hogan/SOPA/ZUMA\n\nWhen Vice President Kamala Harris used Tuesday night's debate to tout her bipartisan appeal, she emphasized the backing she'd received from two particularly notable GOP officials.\n\n\"I actually have the endorsement of 200 Republicans,\" she said, including \"the endorsement of former Vice President Dick Cheney and Congressmember Liz Cheney.\"\n\nOn its own, Harris welcoming the Cheneys to her tent is no big shakes. Liz's work on the January 6 committee left her popular with Democrats. Dick is 83, old enough to seem less likely to start a preemptive war, and was long ago surpassed as a top Democratic bogeyman by Trump himself.\n\nBut if the Cheneys are no longer Republican voters, they remain unrepentant hawks, advocates of aggressively using US military power to achieve American policy aims. And Harris' embrace of a top architect of the disastrous militarism of George W. Bush's administration was one of several signals she offered suggesting fans of the neoconservative foreign policy associated with the Cheneys should feel comfortable with her as president.\n\nOn Gaza, Ukraine, Afghanistan, and other national security matters, Harris appeared to deliberately strike notes aimed at appealing to the interventionist consensus in Washington's foreign policy establishment. The result was Harris' latest and perhaps clearest suggestion that she will not venture far to the left of President Joe Biden, or former President Barack Obama, on national security. That may or may not be good politics, but it is a disappointment to the substantial number of Americans hoping that Harris would pursue a more restrained, anti-war foreign policy than Biden.\n\nHarris, eager to make the election about Trump's unfitness for office, is clearly trying to play it safe on national security, as with other policy areas. What's notable, though, is what playing it safe entails.\n\nNowhere is that dynamic clearer than on Israel. While a handful of pro-Palestinian protesters clashed with Philadelphia police outside the debate, Harris responded to a question about achieving a ceasefire in Gaza by emphasizing her support for Israel's \"right to defend itself.\" To be sure, she then pivoted. \"It is also true far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed,\" she said in a by-now-familiar caveat. \"Children, mothers. What we know is that this war must end.\" She also called for a two-state solution. But Harris's formulation provides no real departure from Biden's policy, which has, so far, failed to end the war.\n\nOn Tuesday Harris even seemed to suggest that she would limit US efforts to restrain Israel from actions that could cause a broader regional war. \"The one thing I will assure you always, I will always give Israel the ability to defend itself, in particular as it relates to Iran and any threat that Iran and its proxies pose to Israel,\" Harris said.\n\nOn Ukraine, Harris focused on distinguishing herself from Trump, who has touted his cozy ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin and repeated his dubious claim he could settle that war \"before I even become president,\" presumably by letting Russia keep the Ukrainian territory it now occupies.\n\nHarris-appealing to \"the 800,000 Polish-Americans right here in Pennsylvania\"-argued that without US support, \"Putin would be sitting in Kyiv with his eyes on the rest of Europe, starting with Poland.\" What the vice president did not mention is that Poland, as a NATO member, enjoys protection Ukraine does not, a mutual defense agreement with the US and its allies. Russia has invaded former Soviet republics, but never, dating to the formation of NATO, risked nuclear war by attacking a member of the alliance.\n\nHarris also avoided offering her own prescription for ending the war in Ukraine, absent Ukraine, which is currently losing ground, achieving its increasingly far-fetched goal of regaining all the territory Russia has seized since 2014. (Nor did she or Trump opine on whether the US should allow Ukraine to launch missiles supplied by the US and other states at targets more than 60 miles inside Russian territory.)\n\nHarris \"acted as though it was still 2022 and would be forever as long as the U.S. kept funding the war,\" with \"no real explanation as to why this was in anyone's best interest, even Ukraine's, to continue on this course,\" wrote Kelley Beaucar Vlahos, a senior adviser at the Quincy Institute, a think tank advocating more dovish US policy.\n\nOn Tuesday, Harris ticked off policy goals that included \"ensuring we have the most lethal fighting force in the world.\" Asked about US soldiers who died during the withdrawal from Afghanistan, Harris said she \"agreed with President Biden's decision to pull out of Afghanistan.\" But the vice president also ripped Trump for launching the negotiations that preceded that pull-out. \"He negotiated directly with a terrorist organization called the Taliban,\" Harris said. Harris argued that the Trump gave away too much in those talks and failed to include Afghanistan's then-government. That may be true, but her answer left her supporting the end of a 20-year war while deriding the mere existence of negotiations with the group the US had been fighting in that war.\n\nHarris also mocked Trump for exchanging \"love letters with Kim Jong Un.\" The details of Trump's diplomatic efforts are very much open to debate. But in singling out negotiations with the Taliban and North Korea, Harris flirted with the argument that the US should avoid talking to bad actors at all. That kind of criticism that has more often come from the hawkish right, and evokes the attacks that Republicans like John McCain and Mitt Romney-both of whom Harris name-checked Tuesday-once hurled at Obama.\n\nIn speaking about Afghanistan, Harris also made the curious statement that \"as of today, there is not one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat zone in any war zone around the world.\" That's true if you do not consider the roughly 3,500 American solders in Syria and Iraq to be in war zones. But many of those troops are on bases repeatedly targeted by rocket attacks attributed to allies of Iran. In January, three American solders stationed in Jordan near the Syrian border were killed , and 30 injured, in a drone attack.\n\nA Harris campaign spokesperson did not respond to questions about that statement. But the vice president's comment does not suggest she sees an urgent need to end the US military presence in the Middle East.\n\nDick Cheney, who helped put US troops in Iraq 20 years ago, presumably approves.\n\nNoah Lanard contributed to this article.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Uncommitted Voters Had Hope for Harris' Gaza Policy. It's Fading.\n\nRally-goers stream past a protestor holding a sign that calls for a ceasefire outside the Kamala Harris and Tim Walz presidential campaign event near Detroit. Adam J. Dewey/Anadolu/Getty\n\nOn Wednesday, Vice President Kamala Harris briefly met with Uncommitted movement leaders Layla Elabed and Abbas Alawieh before a public rally. It was the first time a group affiliated with the diverse and varied pro-Palestine movement had interacted face-to-face with Harris since her elevation to presumptive Democratic nominee.\n\nThe Uncommitted movement co-founders-who represent Michigan voters who chose not to pick Biden as a Democratic nominee because of his policies supporting Israel during its offensive on Gaza-were introduced to the vice president by one of her aides, they said.\n\nIn that short conversation, Elabed and Alawieh told Mother Jones , Harris expressed some empathy for Palestinians. \"We were kind of holding onto each other as I was speaking, because I was so emotional,\" Elabed said. But she, and the movement, were also clear with Harris: They wanted more than words and emotion. They want a formal, official meeting with Harris to talk policy.\n\n\"I told VP Harris through the tears that Michigan voters want to vote for her,\" Elabed said, \"but we need a policy change that is going to save lives.\"\n\n\"We need Vice President Harris to embrace an affirmative message that stops the killing so that we can mobilize voters for whom Gaza is a top policy issue.\"\n\nAn arms embargo has been the central request of the Uncommitted movement, who garnered 700,000  votes and will be sending 30 delegates to the Democratic National Convention . Elabed asked the vice president if she would formally meet with her and Alawieh to discuss an embargo. \"She agreed, yes, we will meet,\" Elabed recalled. And \"she said 'it's horrific'\" of the bombing of Gaza.\n\nBut, during the brief interaction, Harris did not say whether she would make any movement towards an arms embargo or when a meeting would happen. When contacted about the conversation, the Harris campaign would not clarify whether the Uncommitted movement was formally invited to the rally.\n\n\"We were invited to join the VP in welcoming her to Michigan, and that's when both Layla and I each had our own one-on-one interactions with the Vice President and Tim Walz,\" Alawieh said.\n\nA spokesperson for the Harris campaign told Mother Jones : \"Since October 7, the Vice President has prioritized engaging with Arab, Muslim, and Palestinian community members and others regarding the war in Gaza. In this brief engagement, she reaffirmed that her campaign will continue to engage with those communities. The Vice President is focused on securing the ceasefire and hostage deal currently on the table.\"\n\nElabed had hoped for more. \"Her empathy towards me, towards Palestinians, did feel genuine,\" she said. \"But that's not enough, right? Palestinian children can't live off of prayers and sorrows.\"\n\nAt the announcement of Harris' candidacy, the Uncommitted movement hoped that Harris would take less of a hardline approach to supplying Israel with weapons. But that policy change has not been forthcoming. And this week has become a flashpoint. At a rally in Michigan, shortly after the interaction with Uncommitted, Harris publicly rebuked protesters pushing for a ceasefire.\n\nAs Harris spoke, two activists interrupted her. \"If you want Donald Trump to win,\" she told the protesters to cheers, \"then say that. Otherwise, I'm speaking.\"\n\nElabed, who had spoken with the Vice President earlier that same day, was \"disappointed.\" (As Mother Jones reports today, the two protesters are not affiliated with the Uncommitted movement-even though the students share aims with Elabed and others pushing for a ceasefire and end to arms shipments to Israel.)\n\nThis interruption was more than predictable. For months, protesters have dogged President Joe Biden, interrupting campaign events and rallies with the same simple demand, which surveys say over 80 percent of likely Democratic voters want: a permanent ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nPresident Biden has, in the past, introduced proposals for an \"enduring ceasefire \" to his allies in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government. But those proposals have not been successful. Biden has not called for an arms embargo, and-because Israel's military depends on American weapons -many progressives have been frustrated, believing that the only way to end the carnage in Gaza would be to cut off the weapons. Since the start of the war, the US has enacted legislation providing at least 12.5 billion dollars worth of military aid to Israel.\n\nAs recently as June, Joe Biden responded to protesters on the campaign trail with more sympathy: \"Look, they care. Innocent children have been lost. They make a point,\" he said.\n\nHarris' response on Wednesday was quite different.\n\n\"These are protesters that are advocating for human rights,\" Elabed said. \"These are people in our community who are grieving and who for 10 months have watched people with names and faces like those in our community-have watched their family members' homes and lives blown apart by American bombs.\"\n\nCampaign protests have in the past successfully shifted policy: protesters on former President Barack Obama's campaign trail demanded protections for the children of undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe morning after Wednesday's rally, the Uncommitted movement sent out a press release explaining their experience speaking with Harris, and requesting a formal meeting to discuss an arms embargo. Less than one hour after that email was sent, Harris' national security advisor, Phil Gordon , tweeted that the vice president was absolutely not interested in stopping the flow of weapons.\n\n. @VP has been clear: she will always ensure Israel is able to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist groups. She does not support an arms embargo on Israel. She will continue to work to protect civilians in Gaza and to uphold international humanitarian law.\n\n\"[Harris] has been clear...She does not support an arms embargo on Israel,\" Gordon, who had previously written against America's backing of Israel's bombardment of Lebanon, stated. \"She will continue to work to protect civilians in Gaza and to uphold international humanitarian law.\"\n\nUpholding international humanitarian law, as the International Court of Justice declared in July , could mean refraining from arms shipments to Israel. As such, it is not immediately clear what work Harris is \"continuing\" to do toward upholding that law and protecting civilians. The same day that Gordon reaffirmed Harris' evident disinterest in an arms embargo, Israel bombed schools in Gaza City, according to on-the-ground reports .\n\n\"We know she doesn't support an arms embargo,\" Uncommitted co-founder Alawieh said in response to Gordon's statement. \"That's why we need an update to this policy.\"\n\nThousands of Michigan Democrats voted \"uncommitted\" in the primary-and if Harris doesn't change course, the Uncommitted representatives said, she risks losing a crucial swing state.\n\n\"We know that Donald Trump's policies would be destructive,\" Alawieh said. \"That's precisely why we need Vice President Harris to embrace an affirmative message that stops the killing so that we can mobilize voters for whom Gaza is a top policy issue.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Certainly not for the one obvious mistake made by her campaign that would have been a magic bullet in the race. We will find explanations, over time. But they will probably not be the reasons that are our priors. Except for my priors. She is a Black woman-and no, I don't think it's a coincidence that Trump's two victories have come against female candidates.\n\nYes, there are other reasons, and we will find them. But watching Harris concede Wednesday at her Howard University alma mater, where the party for her expected victory had been staged last night, I just couldn't blame her for anything. On social media last night, I called her flawless, but that's silly; nobody is flawless. Yet consider how resoundingly she succeeded in her 107-day campaign: in eroding the polling gap between her and Trump once she became nominee; in wiping the floor with Trump in her one debate against him; at the convention; in raising more money, much more of it from small donors, than the Trump campaign did; in her ground game. As Glenn Thrush put it , \"Democrats have thoroughly mastered/dominated the forms and conventions of big, normal American politics.... One problem: There is no such thing as normal American politics anymore.\"\n\nShe advanced big arguments about the future of democracy at the same time as investing millions in reaching voters with ads about the cost of groceries and prescription drugs, and a truly transformative proposal to extend Medicare to cover in-home care. Should she have put more distance between herself and Joe Biden? Biden was hailed throughout his term as being the most labor-friendly president since FDR, for nominating agency heads that aggressively protected workers and consumers, and for passing legislation that would invest billions of dollars into on-shoring jobs. There are no easy answers here, and I think this week is for mourning, fury, and pulling ourselves together for the long struggle ahead. The people who elected Trump may not think of themselves as OK with fascism, but that's what's in store if we're not ready to fight back.\n\nI had to make a round trip from Harris's non-victory party Tuesday night to her concession speech Wednesday afternoon. It was pretty devastating. There were many people crying. I might have been among them. It was a large enough crowd that I couldn't find my daughter and her friend, yet there was a large empty space in the center of the courtyard that seemed to symbolize all the people who told pollsters they'd vote for Harris but in the end did not.\n\nBut Harris held her head up, so we must, too.\n\nShe gave no threat of insurrection, obviously: \"A fundamental principle of American democracy is that when we lose an election, we accept the results,\" she said. \"That principle, as much as any other, distinguishes democracy from monarchy or tyranny. And anyone who seeks the public trust must honor it.\"\n\nBut she went on: \"At the same time, in our nation, we owe loyalty not to a president or a party, but to the Constitution of the United States, and loyalty to our conscience and to our God. My allegiance to all three is why I am here to say, while I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fueled this campaign-the fight: the fight for freedom, for opportunity, for fairness, and the dignity of all people. A fight for the ideals at the heart of our nation, the ideals that reflect America at our best. That is a fight I will never give up.\"\n\nI found this next rumination stirring and yet a little sad too.\n\n\"The adage is, only when it is dark enough can you see the stars. I know many people feel like we are entering a dark time, but for the benefit of us all, I hope that is not the case. But here's the thing, America, if it is, let us fill the sky with the light of a brilliant, brilliant billion of stars.\"\n\nI don't actually know how we do that. There is no way to sugarcoat these results; no way to pick out silver linings in an environment in which the work to be done against fascism, and for rights, equality, and dignity for all, is so monumental. I could only take solace in one small moment of human connection at Howard, one that made me glad I'd done the round trip. An adorable Black toddler ran and threw herself into my arms. Her mom said her name was Joan (without knowing my name). As I stood there holding this bundle of happiness, her mom told me that her Joan is very shy and never does anything like that. Maybe this Joan will make the world a better place. We did not do that for her in this election, but we can't stop trying.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Critics like Adam Jentleson, a former aide to senators Harry Reid and John Fetterman, claim that \"woke\" advocacy groups made Democrats adopt extreme policies and drove voters away from the Democratic Party, sealing Donald Trump's victory. But the truth is simpler-and more uncomfortable for the Democratic establishment. Despite the noise, voters didn't reject Harris because of leftist rhetoric or activist slogans. They rejected her because she and her party failed to address the economic pain of working-class voters, who chose change over more of the same.\n\nThere's a generation of Black and brown organizers, often the first in their families to step into positions of power, navigating institutions historically dominated by others. Alongside them are downwardly mobile white millennials, raised with expectations of stability but battered by an economy that delivers none. These activists, working within nonprofits and campaigns, fighting for causes once central to Democratic values, have somehow become scapegoats for the party's electoral woes.\n\nWhy, after every electoral loss, is the left always the scapegoat? It's easier to blame activists for pushing a progressive agenda than confront the real issue: the Democratic Party has long been shaped by far more powerful forces-corporate interests, lobbyists, and consultants-whose influence has neglected the real crises facing everyday Americans. We see this cycle again and again.\n\nContrary to establishment narratives, the Democratic leadership has often resisted advocacy organizations pushing for bold reforms on immigration, Big Tech, climate, debt, healthcare, rent, mass incarceration, Palestinian rights, and for policies like the Build Back Better agenda. This tension isn't just about differing priorities-it reveals the actual balance of forces in the party. Corporate donors on Wall Street and Silicon Valley pour billions into campaigns, shaping agendas to suit their interests. A consultant class reaps millions from flawed strategies and failed candidates yet continues to fail upward, perpetuating a pattern of mediocrity. They, not progressives, are the roadblock preventing Democrats from becoming a populist force that could disrupt the status quo and win back voters of all stripes.\n\nIt was these elements within the party that kneecapped the Democrats' most ambitious efforts to help ordinary Americans. The Biden administration entered with huge plans, notably Build Back Better, which would have delivered immediate relief: expanded child tax credits, free community college, universal child care and pre-K, paid leave, and more. Progressives pushed mightily for Build Back Better to pass. It was centrist obstruction-namely Senators Manchin and Sinema-that blocked those policies. The result was a patchwork of long-term measures like the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal, whose benefits won't be felt until 2025 at the earliest, if at all. By failing to pass Build Back Better, Democrats lost the chance to deliver easy-to-understand, tangible economic benefits and solidify their image as the party of working people.\n\nAnd it was corporate Democrats-particularly lobbyists like Harris's brother-in-law, former Uber executive Tony West , and David Plouffe-who held the most sway over Harris's campaign. They advised her to cozy up to ultra-wealthy celebrities, Liz and Dick Cheney, and Mark Cuban, and avoid populist rhetoric that could have distanced her from the corporate elites who dominate the party. In 2024, the biggest spenders in Democratic Party politics weren't progressives-it was AIPAC, cryptocurrency PACs, and corporate giants like Uber, all of whom poured millions into Democratic campaigns without regard for public opinion or the will of the people.\n\nThe Harris campaign's messaging failed because, while populist economic appeals resonated with voters, the public face of the campaign was discouraged from embracing them. Instead, the focus was on issues like democracy and abortion, which, while important, couldn't by themselves capture the priorities of working-class voters. In her public remarks and interviews, Harris, drawing on the advice of corporate leaders, frequently adopted a Wall Street-friendly tone that resonated with business interests, even if it alienated many of her core supporters.\n\nIt's easy to forget that in 2020, Democrats saw historic turnout, driven largely by young voters who were energized by the largest left-wing and Black freedom protests since the 1960s. Biden won, and Democrats seemed to capture the nation's hunger for justice and change, even as protesters marched with polarizing slogans like \"Defund the Police.\" Despite the controversy surrounding these messages, Biden triumphed decisively, calling for racial justice. The energy in the streets reflected a moment of possibility, a vision that real change was within reach. But by 2024, that grassroots energy had dissipated, and the Biden-Harris administration did little to revive it.\n\nThe loss of energy that Biden and Harris presided over showed up in youth turnout, which dropped to 42 percent in 2024, down from 50 percent in 2020 and closer to 2016 levels. However, battleground states saw higher youth turnout, around 50 percent. Young voters favored Harris over Trump by four points (51 percent to 47 percent), a sharp decline from Biden's 25-point lead in 2020. The administration's failure to offer a compelling narrative or deliver meaningful economic reforms alienated many young voters, especially on issues like unconditional weapons transfers to Israel . Trump capitalized on this vacuum with false promises and an anti-war message. Meanwhile, young workers, hit hardest by inflation and stagnant wages, saw little relief from the administration's policies, leaving them feeling unseen and unmotivated. The simplest explanation may be the most accurate: after four years in opposition, Democrats under Biden had no plan for countering centrist obstruction from Manchin and Sinema. Nor did they have a clear strategy for transitioning to a new candidate, as Biden once suggested, or supporting a contested 2024 primary.\n\nThis disconnect was made worse by the administration's lackluster communication strategy. Biden has avoided the media more than any modern president. In contrast, Mexico's President Andrés Manuel López Obrador (AMLO) dominated the narrative with daily, three-hour, entertaining, and combative press conferences that have earned him one of the largest YouTube followings in Mexico. AMLO's approach to the attention economy helped his party to secure another presidential term , defying global anti-incumbent trends.\n\nBiden and Harris's reluctance to embrace what some Democratic elites might view as \"tasteless\" or \"uncouth\" populist appeals allowed their opponents to seize the public's attention, creating a void that ultimately drained the administration of the energy and momentum it once had. Trump's simple, emotionally charged narrative about fixing the economy, winding down foreign wars, restoring order, and protecting \"traditional\" American values may have been filled with bigotry and lies. But it commanded the public discourse, pushing the Biden-Harris administration off center stage.\n\nIt's true that some younger leftists embrace purity politics. But as Semafor 's Benjy Sarlin points out , the most polarizing moments in recent Democratic campaigns-like Beto O'Rourke's \"Hell yes\" remark on gun confiscation or Julián Castro's call to decriminalize border crossings during the 2020 primaries-were driven by the candidates themselves, not external activist pressure. Why did Kamala Harris take the positions she did in 2019? Because she was trying to distinguish herself in a crowded Democratic primary, where Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren were surging and Biden seemed to have the center locked down. Ultimately, these moves were about gaining media attention in a competitive primary, not a direct result of pressure from advocacy groups-many of which, like Sunrise Movement, Working Families Party, and Justice Democrats, with which I was affiliated, have spent years working within the system to create lasting change and deliver real policy results that resonate with voters\n\nThe backlash against \"wokeness\" often rests on vague critiques, offering little more than cultural hand-wringing without any clear solutions. And when those solutions do emerge, they're often morally indefensible. Jentleson's criticism of progressive advocacy groups rings especially hollow when you consider the track record of his own political mentors. In 2010, his former boss, Harry Reid, publicly opposed the \"Ground Zero mosque,\" a proposed Islamic cultural center near the World Trade Center. While technically acknowledging the developers' rights, Reid capitulated to Republican culture wars by suggesting Muslim Americans build the mosque elsewhere. This wasn't a principled stance-it was a political maneuver that lent legitimacy to Islamophobia, feeding into narratives from figures like Sarah Palin and Newt Gingrich, who compared the center to a Nazi building next to the Holocaust Museum. In doing so, Reid allowed bigotry to flourish, leaving a vulnerable community to bear the brunt of political scapegoating.\n\nFrom asylum seekers to transgender rights, today's debates mirror the \"Ground Zero mosque\" controversy. From 2017 to 2020, Democrats, including Harris, were eager to condemn Trump's cruel immigration policies. Now, however, they seem more focused on dodging the topic altogether. These are issues demanding a new approach, one that emphasizes year-round persuasion and agenda-setting over political convenience. Thermostatic public opinion might be a reality of politics, but voters appreciate when you stand for something with conviction and authenticity.\n\nThis is where movements and parties work best together: movements push the boundaries of what's possible, creating the political space to reframe issues like transgender rights and immigration in majoritarian terms, and politicians follow when the political weather aligns with their self-interest. These two sides will clash, but it's in that tension that progress lies.\n\nDemocrats can't be scared of that process. They must stop ceding the narrative to far-right framing and instead invest in populist campaigns that aren't afraid to antagonize villains, highlight the humanity of marginalized communities, and expose the Republican Party's divide-and-conquer tactics. Only then can they build the political power necessary to shift the conversation and secure real change.\n\nAnyone who knows me knows I'm critical of the academic jargon and misguided tactics that sometimes dominate activist circles. But to blame activists for the party's struggles is to overlook the much larger battles they're engaged in: 11 million undocumented Americans left in limbo, a prison system that incarcerates more people than any other in history, and an economy where three people hold more wealth than the bottom half of the country. These are the moral tests of our time-tests that any party claiming to stand for justice will be judged by. Scapegoating those pushing for change isn't just unfair; it's counterproductive, fracturing necessary coalitions and undermining the ability of the party to tackle the crises ahead.\n\nHarris's defeat should prompt serious introspection for Democrats-but not the narrow, one-sided critique Jentleson offers. Everyone, including progressive advocacy groups, has lessons to learn. The path forward isn't about hippie-punching-it never has been. Time and again, the center-left's response to electoral defeat has been to blame the unpopular and disruptive activists pushing for progress, whether abolitionists, suffragettes, labor unions, civil rights leaders, or environmentalists.\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nBooks & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins\n\nJeet Heer\n\nHistory reveals that oversimplified approaches often sidestep the harder questions. Success doesn't come from rejecting the complexity of a diverse coalition but from learning to navigate it. To win, Democrats must inspire the public in a fractured information age, engage meaningfully with the cultural shifts around race, gender, family, and migration, make democracy work despite obstructionists like Manchin and Sinema, and-most critically-deliver tangible results that improve people's lives. And if the corporate, status quo-loving forces within the party are standing in the way of that mission, they must be moved aside.\n\nSuccess will come not by pointing fingers but by telling a story of transformation-with clear villains, bold vision, and conviction that democracy can, indeed, make a difference.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts.

We have a different interpretation of the magazine's abolitionist legacy, one that says a publication committed to justice must refrain from endorsing a person signing off on genocide. We do not support Donald Trump, but to champion Harris at this moment is to ignore the atrocities that are being carried out with weapons supplied by the Biden-Harris administration.\n\nThe Nation 's endorsement notes that on foreign policy the \"positive case [for Harris] is harder to make,\" adding that \"she has failed so far to offer anything more substantive to the millions of Americans...desperate for an end to America's unconditional support for Israel's brutal war on Gaza.\" Yet it goes on to endorse her anyway-implying that domestic concerns are somehow more important. We disagree. On the grounds of Gaza alone, Harris should not have received The Nation 's endorsement.\n\nIn the 12 weeks since she effectively became the Democratic nominee, Harris has failed to differentiate her policies from Joe Biden's blank-check support for genocide. Instead, she repeats the same bland pronouncements about the need for a ceasefire and uses the same passive-voice support for the idea of Palestinian \"freedom and self-determination.\" Again and again, she has been asked by Palestinian, Arab, and Muslim voters, along with a broad coalition of Democrats of conscience, to offer an alternative, and again and again she has refused. She would not even allow a pre-vetted Palestinian supporter of hers to speak at the Democratic National Convention.\n\nWe have watched this abdication of moral responsibility by the Democratic nominee with a growing sense of dismay. As young journalists, we think of our colleagues in Gaza. Israel has killed more than 175 journalists in Gaza since last October-and right now, with US support and the Western media's indifference, Israel is effectively issuing hit lists of reporters in Gaza . During the last year, The Nation has published dispatches from Palestinian journalists, from 14-year-old Lujayn to the journalist Mohammed Mhawish, both of whom have survived air strikes, most likely from US-made weapons . We cannot advocate for a person who is complicit in the murders of fellow journalists and the bombing of colleagues whose pieces we have fact-checked.\n\nWe also struggle with the idea that Harris's domestic agenda can offset the suffering her policies will inflict abroad. As we map even her sunniest domestic proposals against the contours of her foreign-policy program, we remember James Baldwin, a Nation Editorial Board member, who said, \"Every bombed village is my hometown.\"\n\nHarris, for instance, promises to provide tax credits to families with newborns and to sign a law to restore the right to abortion nationwide. Yet her commitment to the welfare of children doesn't extend to the more than 17,000 kids killed in Gaza, hundreds of whom died from inadequate postnatal care like incubators . She will fight for reproductive care in the United States, but in Gaza, tens of thousands of mothers have or will give birth without access to doctors, pain relief, hospitals, or food and water.\n\nHarris also pledges to strengthen our healthcare system. But in Gaza, as many as 1,000 healthcare workers have been killed, 30 of 36 hospitals have been damaged or destroyed, and fewer than half are even partially functional . People routinely die from the blockade of basic sanitary equipment, ordinary medicines, and vaccines.\n\nHarris's plans to relieve the housing crisis in the United States ring hollow next to her support for Israel's destruction of homes in Gaza, the West Bank, and Lebanon. With the Biden-Harris administration's full knowledge and aid, 90 percent of Gazans have been forcibly displaced , and hundreds of thousands of homes have been damaged and destroyed. Nor has the administration done anything to stop the demolitions of houses and illegal expansion of settlements in the West Bank.\n\nJeet Heer\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nBooks & the Arts / Brett Christophers\n\nWhile the Harris campaign declares that \"no one is above the law,\" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu breaks international human-rights law with impunity, as does his country. The International Court of Justice has condemned Israel's illegal settlement and occupation of Palestinian territory as unlawful, while the International Court of Justice has found it \"plausible\" that Israel is committing genocide. Nor has the Biden administration itself proved to be terribly law-abiding. The president, Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin have all been accused of violating the Genocide Convention and international law. Blinken has deliberately broken the law by covering up reports by two US agencies that found that Israel was carrying out war crimes in Gaza and should be denied further military aid. Meanwhile, the State Department has failed to enforce the Leahy law , which requires sanctions against militaries committing war crimes-like Israel's notorious Netzah Yehuda battalion.\n\nWhile some express hope that Harris will break with Biden on Israel as soon as she is elected, they would do well to remember that the current administration has hardly broken from Trump: It completed Trump's plan to move the US Embassy to Jerusalem and reaffirmed his acknowledgment of the illegally occupied Golan Heights as Israeli territory. There is no evidence that Biden has constrained Netanyahu in his war, and any belief Harris would do so is wishful thinking.\n\nAt the same time as the Harris campaign has spurned Palestinian supporters, it has rebuffed the left more broadly. Harris has made it clear that she thinks she can win the White House by attracting more conservative voters. She is now posing as sufficiently right-wing that high-profile Republicans feel comfortable signing off on her candidacy. The Republicans for Harris movement's membership lists the likes of Anthony Scarramucci and Stephanie Grisham-both of whom were part of Trump's cabinet (and could vie for a spot in Harris's administration as well, since she has promised it will include at least one Republican ). In endorsing Harris, The Nation also now finds itself in the company of former vice president Dick Cheney, a principal architect of the Iraq War-a war that The Nation forcefully opposed from the outset.\n\nIn an unsigned editorial, this one published on the eve of Congress's 2002 vote to authorize the Iraq war, The Nation wrote: \"The silence of those of you in the Democratic Party is especially troubling.... For the sake of staying in power, you are told, you must not exercise the power you have in the matter of the war. What, then, is the purpose of your reelection?\"\n\nThe same question needs to be asked today.\n\nThere will be people wondering whom we would endorse, if not Harris. Our answer is that we choose not to endorse any party's candidate for president. We know that a second Trump presidency would be a disaster, but we believe that we cannot vote our way out of this genocide. And while some of us will be voting for president in November-and some of us will not-we all reject the idea that democracy will be safe under a Harris administration.\n\nThe systems of oppression in the United States and Israel are linked. It's no coincidence that FEMA is running low on funds while the federal government sends $17.9 billion to Israel or that the inspirations for Cop City and other vast police training centers are Israeli Urban Warfare Training Centers , which were built with US aid. It's no coincidence that the same technology that Israel uses to enforce apartheid the US deploys at its southern border, which Harris seems eager to further militarize.\n\nStill, we want to be clear: In opting not to support Harris, we are not naïve enough to think we can opt out of politics altogether. Instead, we believe we must challenge institutions devoted to the status quo in the US and, crucially, in Israel. There are so many ways to engage.\n\nWhen it comes to Gaza, you can protest-and keep protesting-until universities and workplaces divest from weapons manufacturers. You can support downballot candidates who support Palestinians. You can shut down highways. Interrupt speeches by war criminals. Boycott institutions and companies that profit from and perpetrate genocide. Give to mutual aid networks in Gaza and Lebanon that attempt to counteract the harm caused by US tax dollars. Don't just unsubscribe but boycott news outlets that feed the genocidal rhetoric-and tell them why you are unsubscribing. And don't stop talking about Gaza wherever you are.\n\nAs journalists, we take this last directive seriously, feeling the weight of the question Palestinian American writer Fargo Tbakhi posed in December: \"What does Palestine require of us, as writers writing in English from within the imperial core, in this moment of genocide?\" We believe that one of the most vital contributions we can make is to confront the media ecosystem that enables-and all too often promotes-the slaughter of Palestinians. Over the last year we've seen the spirit of McCarthyism overtake our industry, with journalists being fired or pushed out of newsrooms or barred from covering Palestine for speaking out. Many publications are punishing journalists who have the moral clarity to accurately describe the horrors of the genocide. As long as journalists on the ground in Gaza continue to risk their lives to tell the story of their own annihilation, then the least US outlets can do is follow their lead and not be afraid to show the truth.\n\nIt is in seeking to follow their lead that we, as journalists, refuse to promote Harris. When we think of her, we do not think of the redemption of American democracy. We think of mangled bodies. Press jackets buried with shredded remains in shoeboxes. Hospital patients, still attached to IVs, burning alive. Grieving mothers wailing until they pass out. The haunted eyes of a Palestinian prisoner. We think of pigtails and lifeless eyes, the smell of rot over mass graves, bodies without heads.\n\nWe think of ashes, dust, and blood.\n\nWritten by Thomas Birmingham, Xenia Gonikberg, Kelly Hui, Samaa Khullar, and Grayson Scott .\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

But on Election Day, she won a smaller share of them than Biden did. This is how it fell apart.\n\nIn early 2020, 20-year-old Sierra, a struggling new mom, followed her son's father from a college town in Indiana to Alabama, where he had found a job. Though she and Derek were unmarried, Sierra thought it would be best for their toddler, Kailani, to have both Mom and Dad nearby, even if they weren't living together. Things stayed tough for the family-until Covid relief began coming through.\n\n\"She could barely believe it,\" the sociologist Jessica Calarco writes in her book Holding It Together: How Women Became America's Safety Net . Sierra got her first Covid stimulus check in April 2020. (All the names in this section are pseudonyms.) A government program offered her rent and utilities relief. She got the expanded child tax credit for Kailani, and she could pay for car insurance and drive to the part-time job she'd found at a gas station. Meanwhile, despite layoffs in the region, Derek kept his job in a big-box store. Life became easier.\n\nMany of the other mothers Calarco interviewed at the time benefited from Covid-era programs. Mandy appreciated the expanded child tax credits and student debt relief. Christine loved the free school lunch program her kids enjoyed during the pandemic. Laura used the money from Covid unemployment funding and stimulus payments to build a freelance marketing business. Others Calarco spoke with benefited from the eviction moratorium and the expansion of Medicaid and SNAP.\n\nBut when those programs, especially the child tax credit, were eliminated, many of these women's lives were upended. In 2022, after the expanded child tax credit came to an end, the national child poverty rate leaped from 5.2 percent to 12.4 percent, above the pre-pandemic rate. Sierra couldn't afford her car insurance anymore and therefore couldn't get to her job. In 2022, she had to take Kailani away from Derek and move home to Chicago to live with her mother.\n\nWhen we wonder why Vice President Kamala Harris lost the election and got a smaller share of the women's vote than expected-smaller even than Joe Biden did in 2020-we seem to forget about these women. The media, and voters themselves, seem to have ignored the Biden administration's economic wins-and overlooked Harris's plans to develop a new \"care economy,\" in which Americans aren't left entirely on their own to pay for and deal with childcare, elder care, and the other all-too-human needs we all deal with at some point or another. But we're also missing this: We did have a care economy during Covid, and then it was pulled out from under the people who needed it most.\n\nIn the United States, \"women have always been our care economy,\" Calarco told me when I spoke to her after Trump's reelection. \"But for a while, during Covid, we had a real care economy. And then it went back to just being women.\"\n\nIf you wonder why Democrats struggled with the women's vote, that might be a clue.\n\nOne of the main reasons many Harris supporters believed she'd win the 2024 presidential election was the assumption that she would just crush the women's vote. After all, women routinely vote in greater numbers than men, and since the 1980s they've favored Democrats. Since Donald Trump's 2016 election, when women went for Hillary Clinton by 13 points, they've powered many successful Democratic campaigns, from Virginia statehouse races in 2017 and 2019, to the 2018 midterms, to the White House in 2020, and to unprecedented success in the 2022 midterms.\n\nThat year, a predicted \"red wave\" never reached shore: Democrats took control of the Senate and only lost the House narrowly, a surprisingly strong showing for a party in the first midterm after it had won the White House. Political analysts credited the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision in June 2022, which overturned a nearly 50-year constitutional right to abortion, with driving the unusually high midterm voter turnout, especially among women. Once Harris became the Democratic nominee in July 2024, women showed a significant shift in her favor away from Trump. A Quinnipiac poll in late August found a \"yawning\" gender gap, with Harris leading among women 58-37 percent, while Trump led among men 57-39 percent. But on Election Day, Harris's lead had dwindled to roughly eight points (exit polls vary a bit)-less than the 15-point advantage Biden enjoyed with women voters.\n\nExit polls are notoriously unreliable, and as the veteran Democratic pollster Celinda Lake attested, \"it's sobering how much variation there is this year.\" But Lake believes the various polls showing the shift of women away from Harris are valid. To understand what happened, we have to look more closely at the vast bloc of women voters. Black women have long been the Democrats' most dependable voters, and in November they were again: Exit polls consistently show that Harris won 92 percent of their vote. Support among Latinas dropped roughly 10 points-58 percent cast their votes for Harris, down from the 69 percent that exit polls say Biden received in 2020.\n\nBut the big problem was white women. This time around, there was reason to hope that even though a majority of white women voted for Trump in 2016 and 2020, they might finally break ranks with the candidate who was an adjudicated sex offender and who bragged about appointing justices who overturned Roe v. Wade , and vote for a woman who made restoring abortion rights the centerpiece of her campaign. After Harris became the nominee, a number of polls found her gaining ground among white women specifically, with a mid-October Reuters/Ipsos poll even finding her in the lead.\n\nIt didn't happen. Though exit polling is hard to compare from election to election because the methodologies and targeted states change, it appears that roughly the same share of white women voted for Trump in 2024 as in 2020. (Pew Research found that in 2016, white women only supported Trump 47-45.) But again, zooming in on this demographic yields interesting distinctions. Harris overwhelmingly won college-educated white women, doing roughly four points better than Biden, and also won young white women and unmarried white women under 55, according to Lake. Jackie Payne of Galvanize Action, a group focused on organizing moderate white women, says the 6,000 voters they tracked went 48-44 for Harris. Jewish women, most of whom identify as white, went 89 percent for her.\n\nConversely, Trump won an overwhelming 83 percent of white evangelical Protestant women voters, according to the Public Religion Research Institute. In 2020, PRRI found that if you subtracted that overwhelmingly pro-Trump subset from white women voters, more white women overall supported Biden than Trump, roughly 58-42. According to PRRI's first 2024 postelection survey, a similar share of non-evangelical Protestant white women voted for Harris in 2024: 56 percent versus 43 percent for Trump. \"In both 2020 and 2024, the presence of white evangelical women voters, eight in 10 of whom support Trump, are the critical mass pushing white women over the top into majority territory for Trump,\" Robert Jones, PRRI's director, tells me. In other words, evangelical white women broke for Trump, and various other subsets of white women voted for Harris-but not by a wide enough margin to swing the overall demographic toward her.\n\nThat might help explain why abortion appears to have been less of a motivating issue than many assumed it would be: 73 percent of all white evangelical Protestants say abortion should rarely or never be legal, after all. But what happened to the other white women voters? Why didn't Harris's appeals on abortion, the fate of democracy, and more support for caregivers win more of them over?\n\nIn more than a dozen interviews with advocates trying to motivate women of color as well as white women to vote for Democrats, two top-line reasons stand out. First, abortion played out differently than many expected. During the campaign, Trump sought to neutralize Harris's significant advantage on an issue that had been politically toxic for Republicans with his promises of moderation. Shadow president and billionaire Elon Musk brazenly invested $20 million in RBG PAC, named after the late liberal Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in order to spread the word that Trump had \"softened\" on abortion. And it worked: \"Abortion won big,\" Gretchen Borchelt, the vice president for reproductive rights and health at the National Women's Law Center, declared at a press conference the day after the election-but Harris, who made abortion rights and reproductive justice central to her campaign, did not. Seven of the state ballot initiatives to secure abortion rights passed, including in swing states like Arizona and Nevada that went for Trump-yet nationally, exit polls show that roughly a quarter of voters who said abortion was their top issue cast a ballot for Trump. In Arizona, 24 percent who voted \"yes\" on the state's initiative also voted for Trump; in Nevada, it was 28 percent. Voters in those states also elected to the Senate abortion rights supporters Jacky Rosen (in Nevada) and newcomer Ruben Gallego (in Arizona). \"In 2022, the abortion issue was nationalized, and the economy was localized,\" Celinda Lake explains. \"In 2024, it was the opposite.\"\n\nAnd it wasn't just in Arizona and Nevada. Voters in other swing states felt that they could count on other protections. \"Michigan [had] already passed an initiative [protecting abortion rights],\" Lake says. \"Wisconsin had a Supreme Court decision [that did the same]. In Pennsylvania, nobody believed [Governor] Josh Shapiro would let anything happen.\" The Atlantic 's Ron Brownstein looked closely at the exit polling of \"pro-choice, economically pessimistic voters\" and found that most went for Trump. Among white women without a college education, two-thirds supported Trump, Brownstein reported, citing CNN's exit polls.\n\nIt's especially bewildering to think about voters' downplaying the threat Trump poses to abortion access after the recent outpouring of public testimony from women about being denied lifesaving medical care by doctors afraid of running afoul of abortion bans. I met one such survivor and activist, Kaitlyn Joshua, at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. The Baton Rouge, Louisiana, resident was miscarrying at 11 weeks pregnant, just weeks after the state imposed a near-total abortion ban. In severe pain, spotting and passing what seemed to be fetal tissue, she visited two emergency rooms but could not get standard miscarriage care: removing the pregnancy tissue. \"I was in pain-bleeding so much my husband feared for my life,\" Joshua said onstage at the DNC. \"No woman should experience what I endured, but too many have.\" Suffering and still bleeding, she went home and eventually passed the rest of the tissue on her own.\n\nIn addition to speaking at the DNC, Joshua went on the Harris campaign's Reproductive Freedom Bus Tour visiting battleground states. She met voters of all ages, races, and ideologies and shared what had happened to her. \"We had beautiful conversations with them on the campaign trail, even conservative women who found themselves envisioning they could be in the same situation I was in,\" she tells me. \"And I think for whatever reason, when they got to the ballot box, it wasn't enough.\"\n\nThe longtime Planned Parenthood leader Cecile Richards believes that these heartbreaking stories of women being denied reproductive care are so new that we can't expect them to make a difference yet. She cofounded Abortion in America, which is dedicated to telling stories like Joshua's, in late 2024. \"We're just now getting maternal mortality reports, and in some states we're not gonna find out about them ever,\" Richards says. Texas, which had imposed draconian abortion restrictions and slashed spending on maternal care even before the Dobbs decision, saw a 56 percent spike in maternal mortality between 2019 and 2022, according to data from the Gender Policy Institute. This year, Texas announced it won't review maternal mortality reports from the past two years. And after ProPublica reported on the deaths of two pregnant women in Georgia, that state fired its 32-member review board, alleging that at least one of them had leaked information to ProPublica.\n\n\"I think those stories are important, but it's going to take time to get them out there,\" Richards says. \"People don't hear things the first time you tell them.\"\n\n\"That is the work of the next four years,\" Joshua says. \"Folks are gonna have to feel it to understand it.\"\n\nThere was another big disconnect with women voters. Ai-jen Poo is president of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, which colaunched Care Can't Wait Action with dozens of other groups, including unions and women's groups, to do voter outreach. She and others involved in that effort told me they kept hearing something surprising from phone-bankers and door-knockers, and some pollsters heard it too: Working-class and middle-class voters told them about the difference that Covid-era relief had made in their lives, and how they struggled when it disappeared. These voters got Covid relief checks, generous unemployment benefits, an expanded child tax credit, and an eviction moratorium. More became eligible for Medicaid and SNAP, along with childcare subsidies. Childcare centers got funding, too, for a while.\n\nBut at various points in 2021 and 2022, those programs went away. And when Democrats tried to restore some of them through the Build Back Better Act, they were thwarted by Republicans, and two of their own: Senators Joe Manchin and Kristen Sinema, both of whom opposed the \"care agenda\" elements of the bill. Thanks mainly to Manchin, Build Back Better was split into two pieces: The first invested $300 billion in climate and energy programs, including $60 billion for manufacturing renewable energy infrastructure. And Biden had earlier signed an infrastructure act that invested billions in building or rebuilding roads and bridges and railroad lines, as well as water and sewer pipes. All of it was important, but as Hillary Holley of Care In Action tells me, stimulating the construction economy was \"the 'men's agenda.'\" The rest of Build Back Better involved investments in the care economy-the \"women's agenda\"-which included universal preschool, subsidized childcare for an additional 20 million children, an extension of the refundable child tax credit, four weeks of paid parental leave, and expanded home elder care through Medicaid. Many progressives initially objected to splitting the bill, and several voted against the climate-and-energy-only bill but eventually relented and helped pass it, on the promise that the care part would come later. As we now know, it didn't.\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nJeet Heer\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nElie Mystal\n\n\"One of the reasons I was so angry that people were saying [Harris] didn't speak to the working class: Well, the working class I interact with every day are women and people of color, and boy, did she speak to them,\" Ai-jen Poo says. She notes that Harris did slightly better than Biden among voters over 65, which could be evidence that her proposals got through to that demographic.\n\n\"I do believe that the Biden-Harris administration is the most pro-labor administration in history,\" Poo says. \"But truthfully, I think that when President Biden thinks of labor, he does think of a 'working-class hero' archetype of a different era.\" Indeed, the white male working class got a lot from the Biden administration; white working-class women got a whole lot less. \"To [Harris], I think the caregiver, the woman in scrubs, is just as much part of the working class as the man in the hard hat.\"\n\nThe economy was nominally strong in the months leading up to the election-unemployment down, wages up-but many voters told pollsters they were worse off than they had been, either under Trump or early in the Biden presidency, because they were.\n\nHarris had a number of plans to rebuild that safety net, including reinstating the refundable child tax credits, a $6,000 tax credit for families with newborns, capping childcare costs at 7 percent of family income, and of course her groundbreaking Medicare at Home plan, which would have provided in-home care for seniors. Those proposals were overwhelmingly popular, says Celinda Lake-the most popular among Harris's policies- if voters heard about them. The New York Times found that of the more than 100 clips from Harris's October media blitz that were tested for increasing her support, Medicare coverage for home health aides ranked at the top. Harris seems to have made some headway reaching voters with these proposals at that point in the campaign: An October Times /Siena poll found that she had an eight-point lead over Trump on the question of which candidate \"cares about people like you\"-and she had a 22-point edge on that question among women. But on Election Day, it wasn't enough. In 2024, Trump ate into the Democrats' share of voters of color, especially men. A majority of Latino men voted for Trump, as well as roughly 20 percent of Black men-a smaller share than some had predicted, but more than Harris could afford. Equally troubling, she saw her turnout in virtually every constituency decline from Biden's large numbers in 2020. And unlike Biden, she lost voters who made under $50,000 a year. No matter what Harris's platform was, the Democrats' economic messaging did not get through, to men or to women. And on this point, it's fair to at least partly blame the Democrats themselves, and the Harris campaign, which in its closing weeks emphasized gauzy slogans like \"A New Way Forward\" and \"An Opportunity Agenda\" instead of hammering away at economic hardship and injustice.\n\nSome advocates for women of color are sympathetic to the complexities of what white working-class women face. \"They suffered financially, and they chose to bet on Trump to improve the economy,\" Hillary Holley says. Some Latinas joined them.\n\n\"We need to understand that white women are multidimensional,\" Holley continues. \"White working-class women voted for a change in the economy. Black women had the same worries, but of course racism drove us away.\"\n\nWhat about Harris's gambit to campaign with former Wyoming representative Liz Cheney to win over conservative white women? In October, the pair visited Ripon, Wisconsin, and then did a one-day tour of three swing states. \"They were trying to use [her] to elevate the risk of another Trump presidency,\" Lake notes. But it didn't work, she adds-and Harris's \"base\" might have been turned off by her palling around with Cheney.\n\nAs I wrapped up this story, I found myself asking: Is my focus on how women voters failed to deliver Harris the presidency a form of internalized misogyny? During his campaign, Trump lavished attention on the so-called \"manosphere,\" allegedly directed to appear on influential podcasts by his 18-year-old son, Barron. It's enough to make you think that the real story of the election is the way Trump capitalized on that media ecosystem. Since his election, Trump has nominated a cabinet of sexual predators and misogynists; this is a cultural backlash that we didn't entirely foresee. That's why, as I sketch out the way Democrats did worse than expected among women, I wind up frustrated at how few people are looking at how and why they did so much worse with men. Sure, it was mostly expected; we're used to it-but is that OK?\n\nWhite women regularly get told to \"come get your people.\" Why aren't progressive white men told to go out and get theirs? Why do they instead complain about the first Black female presidential nominee \"abandoning\" the working class, which renders invisible the female working class she's spent her career fighting for? \"Remember,\" Jackie Payne says, \"if only women voted, Kamala Harris would be president.\"\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Activate your online access\n\nIn her own right, and because we oppose Donald Trump's reactionary agenda.\n\nThe great strength of Kamala Harris's unlikely but existentially important campaign for the presidency is her powerful grasp of what is at stake in this election. \"In many ways, Donald Trump is an unserious man,\" Harris declared in her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention. But as she reminded the delegates, \"the consequences of putting Donald Trump back in the White House are extremely serious.\"\n\nWarning of the danger to democracy posed by a reelected \"Donald Trump with no guardrails\"-especially after the Supreme Court's recent 6-3 decision granting him \"presumptive immunity\" from criminal prosecution for his official acts-Harris urged Americans to \"consider what he intends to do if we give him power again. Consider his explicit intent to set free violent extremists who assaulted those law enforcement officers at the Capitol. His explicit intent to jail journalists, political opponents, and anyone he sees as the enemy. His explicit intent to deploy our active-duty military against our own citizens.\"\n\nWe believe those threats are real. Of course we endorse Harris over Trump. But we also endorse Harris in her own right, as an experienced and capable leader with a vision for America's future that-while not as progressive as we might prefer, particularly when it comes to foreign policy-represents a clear advance on the Democratic presidential nominees of the past half-century. In her selection of a progressive governor, Minnesota's Tim Walz, Harris also demonstrates an awareness of the need not merely to build on the many successes of the Biden-Harris administration but to go farther in the pursuit of economic, social, and racial justice-and the preservation of our planet.\n\nHarris has long been an eloquent and tireless fighter for reproductive freedom. She spent the months following the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization highlighting the connections between that assault and the other Republican efforts to roll back our rights. Now, in Walz, she has a spirited partner to assist her in combating Trump's increasingly deranged anti-abortion rhetoric and the more quietly reactionary-but equally devastating- proposals outlined in Project 2025 .\n\nHarris proposes to make the child tax credit permanent, pass the PRO Act (making it easier for labor unions to organize), build 3 million units of affordable housing, expand Social Security, and tackle price gouging and healthcare costs-all significant extensions of the Biden administration's notably progressive economic achievements. And although some of her wealthy backers haven't been shy in pressing her to fire Federal Trade Commission chair Lina Khan , Harris has, so far at least, stood firm behind Khan and the anti-monopoly agenda she has pursued at the FTC. Harris may have backed away from her 2019 embrace of Medicare for All and a ban on fracking, but Bernie Sanders, describing such shifts as \"pragmatic,\" still has no difficulty in recognizing Harris as worthy of our votes and our support. Neither do we.\n\nOn foreign policy, however, the positive case is harder to make. Harris's campaign refused to allow even one Palestinian elected official to address the Democratic convention. And she has failed so far to offer anything more substantive to the millions of Americans-including the 650,000-plus Democrats who, in order to take a stand on this issue, voted \"Uncommitted\" during the primaries -desperate for an end to America's unconditional support for Israel's brutal war on Gaza. Her change in tone, and her statements taking note of the horrendous death toll among Palestinian civilians, while welcome, might also be little more than the standard \"pro-Israeli, pro-Palestinian, but subtly more pro-Israeli...say-nothing bullshit\" lampooned so effectively on Veep . (Though at least Secretary of State Antony Blinken will be gone .)\n\nOn the war in Ukraine, Harris's position is hawkish. On relations with Russia and China, she has done nothing to indicate any departure from the Biden administration's belligerent rhetoric-or any recognition of the toll the Pentagon's bloated budgets would take on her domestic agenda. Indeed, in her acceptance speech, she promised to \"ensure America always has the strongest, most lethal fighting force in the world\"-a recipe for blank checks from now till doomsday. Still, anyone promoting Trump as a peace candidate needs to check their eyesight. Or their privilege.\n\nDonald Trump has been a cancer on our public life since his days posing as a successful casino operator. His pervasive influence not just on our politics but on our manners, conversations, imaginations, and media developed a momentum that, until Biden withdrew, seemed likely to carry this habitual liar and adjudicated rapist back to the pinnacle of power. Preventing such a calamity ought to be reason enough to turn out to vote-particularly since, unlike in 2016, there is little doubt about how Trump would use such power.\n\nLeftists contemplating voting for a third party in protest of Harris's shortcomings-or out of discontent with our two-party system-need to ask themselves why their particular cause, or their personal discomfort, is more important than making sure that Trump, JD Vance, and their claque of congressional collaborators are defeated decisively, not only in the Electoral College but in the popular vote as well. Especially since we can already see Trump preparing another attack on the legitimacy of our elections.\n\nHarris deserves credit for moving nearly $25 million from her campaign to downballot races. The vice president knows she can't afford to win narrowly in the battleground states; for her and Walz to govern effectively, to break the fever of Trumpism, they also need to lift Democrats in the races that will decide control of the House and Senate. Because a Democratic administration that lacks the means, or the will, to break the current congressional gridlock-or the death grip of a reactionary Supreme Court-risks provoking even greater cynicism and despair.\n\nThis magazine was founded by abolitionists who believed that the victories won on the battlefields of the Civil War, and paid for in blood at Antietam and Gettysburg and Appomattox, needed to be secured in Washington and in the states. Both visionary radicals and deeply practical politicians, they knew what each generation of Americans is apparently fated to learn for itself: that the ruling class of the Confederacy, and the racist ideology whose comforts-North and South-it rationalized, would not simply acknowledge defeat and allow the country to move toward justice and equality. It also had to be disarmed and beaten politically.\n\nThe insurrectionists who attacked the Capitol on January 6, 2021, may have been unsuccessful. Their aims, however, were part of a long campaign to drag this country back not to some mythical golden age but to the actual past when Black Americans had \"no rights which the white man was bound to respect\" (in the words of the Dred Scott decision), women had no control over their own bodies, corporations were free to pollute our air and water, and employers were allowed to terrorize and discard their workers.\n\nJob one for Harris, then, is to defeat Trump-and Trumpism-decisively this November. Yet the current moment, and Harris's campaign, offers more than merely a chance to wake from our long national nightmare.\n\nRalph Featherstone, an activist with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (until he was assassinated by a car bomb in 1970) used to say that a revolutionary is \"someone who knows what time it is in history, and acts accordingly.\" Kamala Harris, who was not yet born when Featherstone went down to Neshoba County, Mississippi, in the summer of 1964 and was still a little girl in pigtails when he was murdered, is no revolutionary. Rather, as the Irish writer Fintan O'Toole has noted , she is the child of revolutionaries who has chosen a different path.\n\nBut unlike the self-proclaimed radicals who argue that there is no real difference between the two parties, or the two candidates, Harris has long shown an enviable-if not always admirable-awareness of what time it is in history. Her rise from the tougher-on-crime district attorney of San Francisco, to the state attorney general who took on corporate criminals and Medicare fraudsters and created the California Homeowner Bill of Rights, to the US senator who quickly established a reputation as a feared and trenchant interrogator, to the vice president of the nation is ample evidence of that.\n\nAmericans are indeed desperate, as Harris puts it, to turn the page on the dead-end politics of the past. Not only on Trump and his corrosive campaign, and on the bankrupt neoliberalism that sent jobs and manufacturing abroad, but on the winner-take-all economy in which billionaires make the rules and the rest of us fight over the crumbs.\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJeet Heer\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nBooks & the Arts / Brett Christophers\n\nFrom Make the Road, the Working Families Party, the Debt Collective, the Sunrise Movement, and 350.org to Moral Mondays, Uncommitted, and the ranks of a resurgent labor movement, we can seize the time, together, to renew our republic, forging a new majority coalition to demand that our government deliver on the endlessly deferred promise of shared prosperity, justice, and freedom.

For anyone who followed the presidential election of 2024 and regards the victory of Donald Trump as an enormous tragedy for the United States and the world, the great foe of serenity is listening to interviews with Democratic Party strategists. This is a group that has displayed a mind-boggling unwillingness to accept any accountability for losing-for the second time in eight years-to Trump, a hoodlum and con man who is widely hated.\n\nLast Thursday, Sheila Nix, Vice President Kamala Harris's chief of staff, participated in a bipartisan conference of staffers from this year's presidential campaign, where she made a stunning claim. \"I would posit she ran a pretty flawless campaign, and she did all the steps that [were] required to be successful,\" Nix said. \"And I think-obviously, we did not win, but I do think we hit all the marks.\"\n\nChris LaCivita, Trump's campaign manager, had the obvious retort. \"Flawless campaigns don't lose,\" LaCivita told The New York Times . \"You can run a great campaign-you can run a good campaign-and still lose. But you can't run a flawless campaign and lose.\"\n\nNix is not the only Harris staffer currently patting herself on the back for doing a terrific job. The same notes of self-satisfaction and complacency dominate a remarkable episode of the Pod Save America podcast that ran in late November featuring four senior advisers for the Harris campaign: Jen O'Malley Dillion, Quentin Fulks, Stephanie Cutter, and David Plouffe.\n\nAs Washington Post columnist Perry Bacon Jr. acutely noted , these four strategists \"kept saying they weren't making excuses or blaming others-while doing both.\"\n\nBacon went on to observe:\n\nWhat the four never did is directly admit any major mistakes they made. \"We should have really pushed Harris to distance herself from President Biden\"; \"Maybe we spent too much time in Arizona\" (Harris lost there by 6 percentage points ); \"We should have had a Palestinian speaker at the Democratic National Convention.\" There were no blunt statements like that.\n\nInstead, the staffers repeatedly defended their work by noting that Harris lost by less in the seven swing states she campaigned in compared with the rest of the country.\n\nThe refrain that Harris overperformed in the swing states has often been made as a defense of the campaign. But it turns out not to be true. As Vox writer Eric Levitz, building on the observation of strategist David Shor, notes , \"Dems' swing-state over-performance mostly reflects how exceptionally badly the party did in NY, TX, FL, and CA.\" In other words, Harris's performance in the swing states was in line with her performance in the rest of the country-leaving aside the solid-blue states where there was a massive erosion of support for the Democratic candidate. This is a particularly revealing admission from Shor, since he was a senior adviser to an outside group that did much advertising in the swing states.\n\nOne could make many other critiques of the Harris campaign: her strategy of hugging Liz Cheney and other far-right Republicans; her use of wealthy surrogates such as Mark Cuban, which undercut her economic message; her closeness to Wall Street donors, who (along with Cuban) made her water down any economic populism.\n\nThe original sin of the 2024 election was Joe Biden's selfish decision to run again, which meant that when he finally gave up the ghost over the summer, Democrats had to scramble to replace him with Kamala Harris.\n\nMany Harris strategists also worked for Joe Biden-and they remain singularly reluctant to hold their former boss to account or to explain their own complicity in Biden's disastrous egoism.\n\nAs CNN notes about the Pod Save America interview, \"None of the campaign brass called out Biden by name, but they repeatedly referred to political 'headwinds' and touted how much Harris needed to claw back just to make the race competitive.\"\n\nQuentin Fulks told Pod Save America , \"We were honestly in, in crisis management mode of keeping President Biden in the race.... Trump's favorability numbers were creeping up as Plouffe said, and we had to do something about that as well. And so it was a lot of walking and chewing gum at the same time, but there really was no sort of contingency planning to turn the race over to her right after that debate or at any point until President Biden definitively said he wasn't going to continue on.\"\n\nThe fact that there was no contingency planning even after Joe Biden's horrendous debate performance against Donald Trump in June is shocking. Yet it is confirmed by Time magazine, which reports : \"Biden let his top hands know on July 21 that he'd be dropping out of the race. O'Malley Dillon said she and campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez both cried that day, and insisted there had been zero planning for that moment. 'Not one ounce,' O'Malley Dillon said.\"\n\nThese Biden loyalists took over Harris's campaign and continued to show the same lack of judgement.\n\nStephanie Cutter told Pod Save America that \"the convention demonstrated a lot of enthusiasm for Kamala Harris, a lot of freshness, future oriented, bringing a variety of coalitions together. We had independents, Republicans, Democrats, business leaders, sports figures, everybody coming together around a new way forward and finally turning the page.\" It is incredibly revealing that Cutter thinks a winning Democratic coalition consists of \"independents, Republicans, Democrats, business leaders, sports figures\" rather than being a multiracial coalition of union members, the broader working class, young people, civil rights activists, feminists environmentalists, and anti-war activists. Hers is a profoundly depoliticized view of the Democratic Party as a vehicle of the bipartisan establishment rather than a coalition fighting to change America. This depoliticized ideology permeated the Harris campaign-and doomed it to failure.\n\nCutter gives an equally revelatory answer to \"the Biden question\" (why didn't Harris distinguish herself from Joe Biden, since that was what voters told pollsters they wanted to see?). According to Cutter :\n\n[O]n the Biden question, we of course got that, everywhere we went. And we knew what the data was. We knew we had to show her as her own person and point to the future and not try to rehash the past. But she also felt that she was part of the administration. And unless we said something like, \"Well, I would have handled the border completely differently.\" We were never going to satisfy anybody. So we did talk about things like: she's a different generation, most of her career is from outside of Washington, not inside Washington. So she knows a lot of the best ideas are from across the country. Her career has been about reaching across the aisle, finding common sense ways to get things done. It's not been based in ideological politics. All of these things we were trying to tell a story and give the impression that she was different without pointing to a specific issue.\n\nJeet Heer\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nThat last sentence is telling: \"we were trying to tell a story and give the impression that she was different without pointing to a specific issue.\" In other words, the goal was a vacuous campaign that would involve no concrete commitment to real politics. Everything was about branding, not policy. But the story Cutter and her colleagues wanted to sell wasn't one that the American people fell for. The public wanted genuine politics, which Harris failed to deliver.\n\nThe Democratic Party needs a fundamental shake-up if it is to recover from the failure of 2024. The party needs to come to terms with the fact the loss to Trump was not an accident that befell the party-but the result of bad decisions made by Joe Biden and his staff, which left Harris in an almost impossible position. But Harris proceeded to make this bad situation even worse by hiring Biden's staffers and following their advice to run a no-content campaign.\n\nThe Democrats will never improve unless the leaders responsible for this catastrophe are held accountable.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts.

And time spent with Cheney prevented Harris from reaching out to the voters she needed.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during a moderated conversation with former US Representative Liz Cheney on October 21, 2024.\n\nKamala Harris made her first campaign appearance with Liz Cheney in Ripon, Wisconsin , the birthplace of the Republican Party, one month and two days before the 2024 election. The point of the visit was to signal to conservatives that they could split with Donald Trump's Republican Party over their concerns about the former president's election denialism, authoritarian rhetoric, and embrace of global strongmen. Republicans could, Cheney argued, cast a \"Country Over Party\" vote for the Democratic presidential nominee-just like the former chair of the House Republican Conference, who broke with Trump over his refusal to accept the results of the 2020 election, planned to do.\n\nThe media loved the story. Lavish attention was paid to the event. Cable channels went live. Ponderous essays were written in the great newspapers of the nation about the prospect that Harris would attract enough Republican votes to upend Trump's bid for a second term.\n\nUnfortunately, while many Democratic tacticians were enthusiastic about Cheney's jumping on board as a Harris backer, Republican voters couldn't have cared less. The Cheney strategy was an abject failure that added few if any votes to the Democratic total, alienated voters who have no taste for the former GOP representative's neocon extremism, and stole precious time from an agonizingly short campaign schedule.\n\nWhile it is certainly not the sole explanation for why Democrats fared as poorly as they did, the Cheney detour was a political fiasco.\n\nThis reality is most apparent in the election results from Ripon. The east-central Wisconsin city where abolitionists, land reformers, and utopian socialists founded the Republican Party in 1854 seemed ripe for a cross-party appeal. Ripon has been a Republican stronghold for 170 years, but the city is also a college town that in the past has shown a good measure of enthusiasm for Democrats such as Barack Obama . But that's not how things played out on Election Day.\n\nOn November 5, Trump won 53.8 percent of the vote (2,097 ballots) in the city of Ripon, while 45 percent (1,753 ballots) voted for Harris.\n\nThat was a worse finish for the Democratic ticket than in 2020 , when Joe Biden won 46.6 percent (1,820 ballots), while 51.7 percent (2,019 ballots) voted for Trump.\n\nBut, surely, Ripon was an anomaly.\n\nNo. Definitely and unequivocally no.\n\nAfter the Ripon rally, Harris returned to Wisconsin for an event with Cheney in Waukesha County in the vote-rich Milwaukee suburbs. The historically Republican county had seen some movement toward the Democrats in 2020 and 2022, and the Harris campaign imagined that a visit to the region by their candidate and Cheney-on a day when the pair also appeared together in Pennsylvania and Michigan-might yield benefits this year. It didn't.\n\nDespite the fact that much attention was paid to the prime-time visit, Trump's percentage of the vote held steady in Waukesha County, at 59 percent.\n\nIn a state where Trump lost by around 20,000 votes in 2020 and won by around 30,000 votes in 2024, his Waukesha County advantage in each year was around 54,000.\n\nSo all that time spent hanging around with Liz Cheney moved few if any votes. And it was even worse nationwide.\n\nIn 2020, according to the NBC News assessment of exit polling date, 14 percent of self-identified conservatives said they voted for Biden, while 5 percent of self-identified Republicans said they did the same.\n\nIn 2024, 9 percent of conservatives said they voted for the Democratic ticket, while just 4 percent of Republican voters said they backed Harris.\n\nThe notion that spending day after day with Liz Cheney-who publicly trumpeted an endorsement from her father, former vice president Dick Cheney, and other right-wing Republicans-would benefit Harris turned out to be a damaging distraction for Democrats.\n\nEven before Harris began making appearances with Cheney in key battleground states, conservative commentator Jonah Goldberg , an astute observer of Republican Party patterns, observed, \"The universe of undecided and persuadable voters in the relevant swing states is small. Those who have been swayed by Cheney's well-known arguments about Trump's unfitness for office have probably already been swayed. How many voters might yet be persuaded by her formal endorsement of Harris? Dozens? Hundreds? Maybe.\"\n\nGoldberg's skepticism was proven right by the exit polls. But that wasn't the worst of it for the Harris campaign.\n\nUnfortunately for the Democrats, the embrace of the Cheneys came at a cost that has been too rarely noted in the postelection analyses of the party's defeat on November 5.\n\nBecause President Biden delayed his decision to end his reelection bid until late July, at a point when Democratic poll numbers had collapsed, Harris was left with just 107 days to mount a presidential bid.\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJeet Heer\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nBooks & the Arts / Brett Christophers\n\nEvery day was precious, and every signal sent to potential voters was significant. The days spent with Cheney, and the resources expended to promote endorsements from neoconservative Republicans, cost the Democrats in significant ways. They sent a signal to potential Democratic voters, many of who recalled the Iraq War and other Cheney projects, that the focus of the campaign was on outreach to the right, They ate up time that could have been spent campaigning in union halls in working-class communities with figures such as United Auto Workers union president Shawn Fain and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. They burned up time that could have been devoted to sincere, if difficult, conversations about Gaza. They foreclosed opportunities to reach out to Latino communities in swing states. The list goes on and on.\n\nBut the bottom line is constant: Every minute that Kamala Harris spent with Liz Cheney was a colossal waste of the candidate's time.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

They burned up time that could have been devoted to sincere, if difficult, conversations with Arab Americans, students and others about Gaza. They foreclosed opportunities to reach out to Latino communities in swing states.

      "text": "Kamala Harris's Hundred-Day Campaign\n\nWhen Joe Biden called Kamala Harris on the morning of Sunday, July 21st, she was in the kitchen at the Vice-President's residence, a turreted mansion on a hill in Northwest Washington. Harris was wearing sweatpants and a hoodie from her alma mater, Howard University. Her husband, Doug Emhoff, was in Los Angeles, but the house was bustling with relatives. She had just finished making bacon and pancakes for two grandnieces before sitting down with them to work on a jigsaw puzzle.\n\nBiden was calling from isolation, both literal and political; he had spent the previous night socially distanced at his vacation house in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, recovering from COVID and absorbing the reality that he had lost the confidence of the Democratic Party. Twenty-four days earlier, Biden's addled performance in a televised debate with Donald Trump had sparked a frantic effort to replace him at the top of the ticket. On the phone, Biden told Harris that he was ending his bid for reëlection. More to the point, he said that he would be endorsing her as the Presidential nominee.\n\nHarris was grateful-though it wasn't clear that Biden's support would suffice. Last year, one poll found that she had the lowest approval rating of any Vice-President since its records began. At least half a dozen other prominent Democrats-including Cabinet members and the governors of Michigan and Pennsylvania-were seen as potentially stronger contenders. During the uncertain weeks when Biden was deliberating over whether to drop out, strategists and pundits had imagined selecting a candidate through some kind of primarylike contest-composed, perhaps, of town halls and an open convention. One typical proposal warned that handing Harris the nomination without a fight would \"set her and the Party up to fail.\" But Harris was accustomed to facing resistance. At an event in D.C. last spring, she told the audience, \"Sometimes people will open the door for you and leave it open. Sometimes they won't. And then you need to kick that fucking door down.\"\n\nBy the time Biden announced his withdrawal, that Sunday afternoon, a scramble was already under way, largely out of public view. Bakari Sellers, a former South Carolina state representative who helped Harris secure the nomination, told me that her team saw value in moving swiftly. \"We weren't going to do this bullshit that other people were asking for,\" he said. In his view, an open convention was a way to \"skip over Kamala.\"\n\nAfter Biden's call, Harris had summoned aides to her house, and a dozen or so people gathered around a table. She sat beside Tony West, her brother-in-law and unofficial consigliere, who had served as the third-ranking official in Obama's Justice Department. In the hours that followed, her team undertook an operation that was less an improvisation than a culmination of years spent cultivating allies, including some forty-seven hundred delegates to the Democratic National Convention.\n\nEver since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, in 2022, Harris's staff had been taking greater pains to plan and track her encounters around the country-photo lines, meet and greets, and other occasions of well-managed access-with an eye toward soliciting help to mount a campaign in 2028. Now, on a radically truncated schedule, they opened spreadsheets and started making calls. Harris took the biggest names: Barack Obama, Bill and Hillary Clinton, the top Democrats in the House and Senate, and the heads of the Congressional Black Caucus, the Hispanic Caucus, and the Progressive Caucus. She talked to the leaders of major unions and to advocates for abortion rights, the environment, and gun safety. She also called potential opponents-Josh Shapiro, Gretchen Whitmer, and a handful of others. Several asked her a version of the same question: \"Do you think there should be some kind of process?\" Harris said that she was open to it but added, pointedly, that she was already seeking pledges from delegates. In other words, good luck with your town halls.\n\nLink copied\n\nNot everyone signed on to her candidacy right away. Obama released a statement voicing confidence in \"a process from which an outstanding nominee emerges.\" The former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and the House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries praised Biden-while conspicuously saying nothing about a successor. But, around the country, activists who favored Harris were coördinating. Mini Timmaraju, a delegate to the Convention and the head of the abortion-rights group Reproductive Freedom for All, told me, \"My phone was ringing off the hook from people, like, 'Women of color, we've got to stand together for Vice-President Harris. If they don't consolidate around the Vice-President, we're going to create trouble.' \" Harris called Timmaraju from her table to ask her to pledge support. \"I was so excited, I was, like, 'Yes! Hell yes, ' \" Timmaraju recalled. Then, realizing that she had just shouted at the Vice-President, she added, \"I'm sorry I yelled at you, Ma'am.\"\n\nBy 10 P . M ., the table was littered with half-eaten pizza and salad, and Harris had called more than a hundred people. Several Democrats who might have challenged her, including Whitmer, Shapiro, and Mark Kelly, the senator from Arizona, had promised their support. Aides estimated that they'd have pledges from a majority of Convention delegates within forty-eight hours. Harris was on track to be the first Democratic nominee since Hubert Humphrey, back in 1968, to secure the nomination without winning a primary. As Sellers put it, \"We ended up having an open convention. It was just the shortest open convention in the history of mankind.\" Harris never had time to change out of her sweats.\n\nBy the following morning, with a hundred and six days until the election, she had endorsements from a majority of Democrats in Congress, two large unions, and a growing number of state delegations. Some worried that the choice was hasty. Mike Murphy, an anti-Trump Republican strategist, tweeted, \"Dems would be well advised to slow down and think this through.\" The Atlantic ran an essay by Graeme Wood titled \"Democrats Are Making a Huge Mistake.\" The Washington Post columnist Perry Bacon told colleagues, \"To be totally honest here, my worry is that it seems like Trump is likely to win.\" But Harris's allies in Washington believed that she was being underestimated, just as many of them had been. \"There's a whole universe of us in this town that nobody saw,\" Timmaraju told me. \"For so long, our interactions and engagements just weren't considered relevant for political prognosticators.\" She added, \"Look who organized and mobilized within twenty-four hours!\"\n\nDavid Axelrod, who was the chief strategist for both of Obama's Presidential campaigns, told me, \"There was an argument that she would be strengthened by a competition, but she showed a mastery of the internal politics, which is one test of a potential candidate. People respond to competence, and that was a very competent operation.\" He compared it to a rapid military strike. \"She didn't get handed this nomination,\" he said. \"She took it.\"\n\nIn two days, Harris signed up more than fifty thousand volunteers. On CNN, the commentator Van Jones said, \"You can do your whole career and not get fifty thousand volunteers.\" By the following Monday, the number had reached three hundred and sixty thousand. There was a cascade of fund-raising video calls, organized by demographic, starting with #WinWithBlackWomen. The one arranged for white women-\"Karens for Kamala,\" as one organizer joked-broke the record for history's biggest Zoom. In Florida, at the Villages, a retirement community known as a pro-Trump stronghold, Harris supporters staged a parade that an organizer on the scene solemnly called the \"largest golf cart caravan for a Democratic candidate in nearly a decade.\"\n\nHarris's sudden arrival at the forefront of American politics summoned the prospect that, as John F. Kennedy put it in 1961, the \"torch has been passed to a new generation.\" But it also evoked a less often cited part of Kennedy's formulation-his description of Americans as \"tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace.\" In the past eight years, Democrats, like the rest of the country, have witnessed too much tumult-Trump, Charlottesville, COVID , George Floyd, January 6th, the end of Roe-to expect easy success.\n\nAnnette Gordon-Reed, a Harvard law professor and historian, watched the surge of enthusiasm and was reminded of the power of contingency-the politically crucial alchemy of timing, biography, and context. She told me, \"The electorate was perfectly positioned to accept an individual who could be portrayed as a harbinger of the new when lots of people were feeling stuck, as if our politics would be nothing but unbridled nastiness from now on.\"\n\nYet Harris treated the moment gingerly. Unlike Obama, she did not give a big speech on race; unlike Hillary Clinton, she didn't dress in the white of Seneca Falls. Since Clinton ran in 2016, the number of female governors has doubled; some six hundred more women now sit in state legislatures. Harris, though, trod so carefully on matters of identity that at times one could lose sight of the fact that a woman descended from Jamaican and Indian immigrants, and married to a Jewish man, was being regarded as a plausible candidate for the Presidency. \"Harris doesn't emphasize it, but her appearance alone carries the message,\" Gordon-Reed said. \"Something has changed in this country when a person like her can be in this position. That is inspiring to many people. Of course, to a substantial segment of the population, it is alarming. And we see where the alarm about having had a Black President has taken us.\"\n\nBy gaining the nomination so late, Harris spared herself the obligation of courting the orthodox wing of her party in primaries. But a short run has risks; it left her little time to explain what she believes and what she would do in office. Temperamentally, she preferred to disgorge policy points than to explore her thinking with reporters. Early focus groups showed that voters had only vague impressions of her, and Republicans were racing to shape them, calling her a \"D.E.I. hire\" and \"Comrade Kamala.\"\n\nIn fact, Harris has never been a favorite of the left, and progressives in Congress, such as Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, had fought to keep Biden in the race, assuming that a Harris Administration would not give their priorities as much attention. For as long as Harris has been in politics, she has been motivated less by ideology than by a practical ambition to widen the perimeter of power, to make insiders out of outsiders-including, not incidentally, herself. Rather than try to upend the system, she has vied to run it.\n\nAs the campaign enters its final weeks, neither Harris nor Trump has a decisive advantage. She is ahead by roughly 2.5 per cent nationally, but it's not clear that the margin is wide enough to win the Electoral College. (Democrats have secured the popular vote in seven of the past eight Presidential elections, but lost the electoral vote, and the White House, in two of them.) Harris is desperately trying to hold together an anti-Trump movement that sprawls from \"Cheney to Chomsky,\" as Maurice Mitchell, the national director of the Working Families Party, told me. \"Her challenge is to make sure that none of the factions flee,\" he said, \"and, at the same time, to win over new people.\"\n\nHarris relied on friends and allies to secure the nomination, but she will need a coalition of strangers to win the election. Ron Klain, who worked alongside Harris as Biden's chief of staff, suspected that the result would come down to what he called \"the stretch of I-76 that goes from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh.\" It's full of small former steel towns, home to older white voters who helped Biden defeat Trump in 2020. There are places like that all over Michigan and Wisconsin, Klain added: \"Her ability to make those people comfortable, and hold on to those people that Biden had, is going to be critical. Familiarity is very important. It hasn't been a part of her brief until now, and it has to become one.\"\n\nUntil Harris seized the nomination, she was fighting for basic respect. During the G.O.P. primaries, Nikki Haley roused audiences by saying that the prospect of a Harris Presidency \"should send a chill up every person's spine.\" Republicans mocked Harris's laugh and the Old World aphorisms she got from her mother. (A ubiquitous clip showed her channelling a maternal scolding: \"You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?\") The left-leaning media were hardly kinder. In May, \"The Daily Show\" excerpted some of her moonier comments, such as \"It is time for us to do what we have been doing.\" To explain her oblique style, the show conjured Harris's \"Holistic Thought Advisor,\" who described her manner of speaking as \"a work of modern art that you look at and go, 'I wonder what that was all about.' \"\n\nBut, in the first two months of Harris's candidacy, her favorability rating soared. The most promising poll, by NBC, showed a gain of sixteen points-the biggest jump for any politician that the network had recorded since the country rallied around President George W. Bush after the attacks of September 11, 2001. The awkward tendencies that her opponents had mocked turned out to be a significant part of her appeal. \"She seems like a politician I could sit down and have a laugh with,\" one fan known for impersonating her on TikTok declared. Things that had seemed like political handicaps became evidence of authenticity: her fondness for dull statistics and Venn diagrams, her disregard for what she called \"lovely speeches,\" her disdain for introspective questions about her \"moment.\"\n\nAt fifty-nine, Harris is only four years younger than Barack Obama, but she has arrived at a time when voters, especially young ones, are less patient with the sheen of politics, with figures who seem just out of reach. Instead, they want a performance of approachability-what the sociologist Julia Sonnevend, in her recent book, \"Charm,\" calls \"personal magnetism that rests on proximity.\" It's a method exemplified by Jacinda Ardern, New Zealand's young Prime Minister, whose Facebook page, Sonnevend writes, \"presented vulnerability and mistakes as features rather than as bugs.\" As Harris reintroduced herself to the public, fans collected indicators of normalcy: clips of her hamming it up with kids in a marching band, cooking videos of her cracking eggs (\"one-handed!\"), stories about her supplying jasmine-scented candles as parting gifts to guests at the Vice-President's residence.\n\nLink copied\n\nFor months during Biden's campaign, focus groups and polls had suggested that voters liked the Party's ideas but not its candidate. A former White House official told me, \"Groups would do this testing-on the 'freedom agenda,' on shrinkflation-and voters would say, 'That's what Democrats should be saying!' And it was, like, 'Oh, God, that is what he's saying.' But they didn't want to hear it from him, because they thought he was too old.\"\n\nWhere Biden failed to garner support for his \"freedom agenda\"-\"the freedom of choice, the freedom to have a fair shot\"-Harris made it personal, anchored in her impassioned defense of abortion rights, in ways that Biden, the conflicted Catholic, never could. And she was able to take on other issues that bedevilled Biden, even if the details had scarcely changed; she hewed closely to his language on Israel and the Middle East, but some members of the pro-Palestinian left were more inclined to give her the benefit of the doubt. (The activist Abbas Alawieh told Politico that Harris \"conveyed more sympathy for the plight of civilians in Gaza than President Biden did at any point.\") The former White House official told me, \"She feels culturally more relevant, so it clicks. Look, that's politics.\"\n\nOn July 30th, Harris visited Atlanta for the first major rally of her campaign. Four years earlier, Georgia had given Biden a narrow win, but recently it seemed to be swinging back toward Trump; Biden's campaign had already started to turn its attention to the Midwest. Still, some ten thousand supporters crowded into the basketball arena at Georgia State University. Harris belongs, barely, to the first generation to grow up with hip-hop on the radio, and the influence showed; a d.j. played Fast Life Yungstaz' \"Swag Surfin' \" and Kendrick Lamar's \"Not Like Us.\" When the rapper Megan Thee Stallion and her backup dancers took the stage, a banner unfurled in the crowd with the words \"Hotties for Harris.\" An m.c. told the attendees to pick five people from their contacts, take a selfie, and \"show them where you are!\" I noticed a woman hobbling on a plastic boot. Her name was Kim Amis, and she had a broken ankle. She'd waited for eight hours, in line and on the arena floor, to hear Harris speak. But, she said, as a Black woman who never thought she'd see the day, \"even with the boot, I had to be here.\"\n\nHarris stepped onstage, relaxed and beaming. She stands just over five-four but looks a bit taller, thanks to heels and a habitual mode of self-presentation that she calls \"chin up, shoulders back.\" The particulars of her speech were less memorable than the mood in the arena. (She has little patience for rhetorical flourishes, which she dismisses as better saved for a \"beautiful sonnet.\") For the first time in months, Democrats were not just campaigning against Trump; they were campaigning for someone. As important, voters seemed pleased to have the focus turned back on them. Harris made her case in the first-person plural, with little in the way of \"I\" and \"me.\" She told the crowd, \"When we fight, we win,\" and they chanted, \"We're not going back!\"\n\nIn the past eight years, Democrats have spent much of their time consumed by what the late political theorist Judith Shklar called \"the liberalism of fear.\" As a child, Shklar fled Hitler and Stalin, and she became convinced that liberals' crucial task was to restrain the worst manifestations of cruelty. But constant fear is exhausting, and Harris thrilled the crowd in Atlanta by taunting Trump for threatening to back out of a debate with her. She cocked an eyebrow and deployed a line that her speechwriters had surely imagined spreading online: \"If you've got something to say, say it to my face!\"\n\nBiden had occasionally indulged in schoolyard gibes at Trump, but mostly his campaign insisted on the high seriousness of the moment; his ads hinged on a husky-voiced elderly man warning of the death of democracy. Trump, meanwhile, treated the prospect of autocracy as a big joke, and his supporters laughed along. Harris's campaign has tried to reclaim the punch lines. Before one of Trump's press conferences, at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, it released a statement titled \"Donald Trump to Ramble Incoherently and Spread Dangerous Lies in Public, but at Different Home.\" In Atlanta, as Harris reduced Trump from a figure of historic menace to the butt of wisecracks, it called to mind a line from George Orwell: \"Every joke is a tiny revolution.\"\n\nAs a candidate, Harris often asks to be seen as a \"joyful warrior.\" Longtime colleagues and observers will tell you that her rise owes more to the warrior side. At a recent rally, as she and Oprah Winfrey sat facing each other in talk-show-style armchairs, Winfrey noted with surprise that Harris had described herself as a gun owner. \"If somebody breaks into my house, they're getting shot,\" Harris replied. Laughing, she added, \"I probably should not have said that, but my staff will deal with that later.\"\n\nKamala Devi Harris was reared mostly by her mother, Shyamala Gopalan, who came alone to America when she was nineteen years old. Born in Chennai, Gopalan had applied to the University of California, Berkeley, without telling her parents. She arrived in 1958, long before the recent wave of Indian immigration, and racism was routine. As Harris wrote later, her mother was \"treated as though she were dumb because of her accent\" and \"followed around a department store with suspicion.\" But Gopalan had an unshakable sense of self-worth. \"We are Brahmins, that is the top caste,\" she told SF Weekly in 2003. \"My family, named Gopalan, goes back more than 1,000 years.\" Meenakshi Ahamed, the author of a forthcoming book on Indian Americans, notes that many prominent figures-Indra Nooyi, the former C.E.O. of PepsiCo; Vivek Ramaswamy, the conservative gadfly-have Brahman heritage. It \"inoculated them from the negativity,\" she told me. \"They held their heads high. If kids encountered discrimination, parents would tell them, 'Just get ahead.' \"\n\nGopalan had grown up during India's fight for independence, and in Berkeley she was drawn to the Black community and the freedom struggle. \"It was the foundation of her new American life,\" Harris wrote in her 2019 memoir, \"The Truths We Hold.\" Gopalan joined the Afro-American Association, an influential study group that met to discuss apartheid, liberation movements, and the history of racism in America. Its members went on to introduce the holiday of Kwanzaa and to advocate for the creation of Black-studies departments; two young participants, Bobby Seale and Huey Newton, founded the Black Panther Party.\n\nDuring a meeting in 1962, Gopalan was impressed by a charismatic speaker: a tall, dapper Jamaican doctoral student named Donald Harris. According to an essay that he wrote about his heritage, Harris was descended from enslaved people and from an Irish slaveholder, Hamilton Brown; like Gopalan, he had grown up under British colonial rule. He was an early exponent of the study of inequality, and eventually became the first Black economics professor to get tenure at Stanford. \"He was a very rigorous teacher,\" Ajay Chhibber, a former student, told me. \"A very imposing figure in the classroom.\" The Stanford Daily once wrote that he was known as \"a pied piper leading students astray from neo-classical economics.\" Gopalan, for her part, completed a Ph.D. in nutrition and endocrinology and specialized in the study of breast cancer.\n\nDonald and Shyamala married in 1963, and Kamala was born the year after that; her sister, Maya, followed in 1967. As a kid, Harris was brought to protests in a stroller-she has dim memories of a \"sea of legs moving about\"-and she developed an image of herself as a protector. Stacey Johnson-Batiste, a kindergarten friend, remembered a day when a little boy broke her art project, a piece of pottery. Harris \"jumped in between him and me, and said some words that made him so mad that he picked up a rock or piece of that hardened clay and hit her,\" she told me. Harris got a cut above her eye, which left a scar that's still visible.\n\nLink copied\n\nBy the time Harris was five, her parents had \"stopped being kind to one another,\" she later wrote. Shyamala filed for divorce in 1972, and won custody of the girls. Donald, outraged, wrote that the State of California had taken away his children on the assumption that \"fathers cannot handle parenting (especially in the case of this father, 'a neegroe from da eyelans').\" The girls saw him during summers and weekends, but Harris rarely speaks of him now. \"My father is a good guy, but we are not close,\" she once told SF Weekly . Donald has been even more reticent, making only a few public comments as his daughter gained prominence. In 2019, a radio host asked Harris if she had smoked pot, and she said she had, joking, \"Half my family's from Jamaica.\" Her father responded, in an online statement that was later deleted, that his ancestors were \"turning in their grave\" to see the \"family's name, reputation and proud Jamaican identity\" connected with a \"fraudulent stereotype of a pot-smoking joy seeker.\"\n\nAfter the divorce, Harris's mother focussed on raising \"confident, proud Black women,\" as Harris put it, with a strong strain of social justice. Harris entered a voluntary busing program that sent her to a predominantly white school, but the family stayed close to members of the Afro-American Association and sometimes attended a Baptist church. At age thirteen, after moving to Montreal for her mother's research, Harris protested with her sister in front of their apartment building because it had banned children from playing on the lawn. (The policy was changed.)\n\nWhen Harris talks of the origins of her interest in government, she lingers on a moment from her time in Montreal: a friend from Westmount High, Wanda Kagan, was being physically and sexually abused at home, and Harris's mother took her in. \"A big part of the reason I wanted to be a prosecutor was to protect people like her,\" Harris has said. In subtler ways, she was coming to see government as an arena where the powerful encounter the weak, bringing either aid or harm. She observed her mother-a small, watchful immigrant-grow nervous around people in uniform. Passing through customs, she'd snap at her daughters, \"Stand up straight. Don't laugh.\"\n\nAfter five years in Canada, Harris enrolled at Howard, where she studied political science and economics. Though she protested apartheid, she maintained some distance from the most extreme activists. She carried a briefcase on campus, interned at the Senate and the Federal Trade Commission, and joined Alpha Kappa Alpha, America's oldest Black sorority, which prides itself on grooming leaders.\n\nShe graduated in 1986, then returned to California, to attend Hastings College of the Law. When she told relatives that she planned to be a prosecutor, they were dubious. The family story centered on \"demanding justice from the outside,\" she wrote in her memoir. But she had come to see herself as something else-a figure with dual loyalties, an ally embedded in the establishment. She wrote, \"When activists came marching and banging on the doors, I wanted to be on the other side to let them in.\"\n\nSan Francisco politicians-the ones who actually get elected-tend to be more practical than the hippieish caricature of the place suggests. To win, they must manage progressive activists, old-money centrists with real-estate fortunes dating back to the gold rush, and new-money libertarians in Silicon Valley. When Biden was campaigning for the White House in 2020, Pelosi, one of the city's most powerful figures, cautioned him about moving too far left. She said, \"Let us win, O.K.?\"\n\nAs Harris rose through the political establishment, she developed a politically inclusive maxim, \"No false choices,\" which she cites so frequently that aides once got it printed on stress balls to keep around the office. Louise Renne, who served as San Francisco's city attorney for fifteen years, told me that successful leaders there had to figure out, \"between the left and the right and in between, what's going to work ?\" In 2000, she interviewed Harris for a job overseeing civil cases involving children. \"When you're talking about child abuse or neglect, you have to be tough,\" Renne said. \"But, on the other hand, I needed somebody who was kind and compassionate.\"\n\nAfter two years working for Renne, Harris decided to run for district attorney, and she asked a Democratic operative named Rebecca Prozan to manage her campaign. Prozan recalled an early meeting in which she asked Harris about her name recognition: \"I said, 'Have you done any polls?' And she said, 'Yeah, I'm at eight per cent.' \" Prozan thought, What am I supposed to do with that? But Harris believed that she could split the ideological difference between her two opponents. \"She was running up the middle, where it's always hard to define oneself,\" Prozan said. \"But she was taking the angle that the office needed a professional prosecutor-meaning no more politics.\"\n\nHarris opened her campaign headquarters in Bayview-Hunters Point, a neglected former shipyard, but cultivated donors and volunteers in wealthy Pacific Heights-a world that she had navigated since the mid-nineties, when she dated Willie Brown, the speaker of the California Assembly. Her relationship with Brown, who was thirty years her senior and separated from his wife, has been a blessing and an \"albatross,\" as she put it. He introduced her to San Francisco's political élite, but her opponents have tried to discredit her by saying that Brown launched her career. (Brown, who is now ninety, has pointed out that he aided most of San Francisco's major politicians during their ascent, including Pelosi, Dianne Feinstein, and Gavin Newsom.)\n\nHarris won the race, partly by avoiding being tagged as either too stringent or too lenient. (She later produced a book-length case for her ideas titled \"Smart on Crime.\") But at times her approach left her politically isolated. Barely three months after she took office, a police officer was killed on patrol, and she announced that she would not seek the death penalty, citing a principled objection to capital punishment. Police took to shunning her, turning their backs when she passed. At the officer's funeral, where Harris sat in the front row, Feinstein gave a speech that criticized her position. Thousands of policemen stood to applaud.\n\nEventually, though, Harris won support from law-enforcement groups for her commitment to locking up violent offenders; she described public safety for marginalized neighborhoods as a \"civil right.\" She staffed the D.A.'s office with people from the neighborhoods that were most familiar with the impact of both crime and punishment. One of her recruits, Lateefah Simon, a young community organizer, initially balked at working for a prosecutor. Simon recalled, \"She's, like, 'If you want to spend the rest of your life holding a bullhorn, begging me to do the right thing, fine-I'll listen to you. But you can also be on the other side of the table.' \" When Simon showed up on her first day dressed in a Puma sweatsuit, Harris ushered her to a wall of photos of previous district attorneys-all white, all male. \"She tapped her finger on her own photo, and she said, 'Lateefah, you see what's going on here? Folks in our community are going to want me overnight to shift this system to one that is fair. This is why you're here. We're going to chip away at what's rotten.' And then she says, 'And don't you ever come to this office dressed in sweatpants. I want you to be respected.' \" When Simon came back the next day, Harris handed her a shopping bag containing a new business suit.\n\nLink copied\n\nWhen Harris became state attorney general, in 2011-in an election so close that the San Francisco Chronicle mistakenly called it for her opponent-she showed a canny sense of political theatre. She downplayed her ties to liberal Berkeley by calling herself a \"daughter of Oakland.\" (She was born in an Oakland hospital and moved to the city in her twenties.) In 2013, when the Supreme Court ruled to recognize same-sex marriage and the first ceremonies were performed at San Francisco City Hall, Harris made a point of arriving on foot, to echo a famous picture of Thurgood Marshall beside an Alabama courthouse during a segregation case.\n\nAs attorney general, she made perhaps her deepest mark in 2012, during a national reckoning with foreclosure practices during the financial crisis. Five big banks proposed state-by-state settlements, but Harris rejected the offer for California. Valerie Jarrett, a friend and a former Obama adviser who was briefed on the negotiations, recalled, \"She just kept saying, in a very calm and deliberate voice, 'We can do better. They should be held accountable.' \" Though Harris's position irritated some officials in the Treasury Department, which was eager to resolve the issue, she resisted-and was joined by Beau Biden, her counterpart in Delaware, who introduced her to his father. The banks acquiesced; instead of four billion dollars, California got twenty billion.\n\nIn 2016, she won a seat in the U.S. Senate. That same night, Trump's surprise victory scrambled political futures across the country. Harris was no longer heading to Washington to work alongside the first woman President and start building a national reputation. Instead, she arrived in a place that was fiercely divided by Donald Trump.\n\nIn a political battleground, Harris's scrappiness was an advantage. She was lauded for prying accidental truths from Senate witnesses. During confirmation hearings for William Barr, Trump's Attorney General, she asked if the President or his aides had ever \"suggested that you open an investigation of anyone.\" Barr looked forlorn, like a basset hound with a hurt paw, and sought refuge in quibbling over what she meant by \"suggested.\"\n\nAt a time when identity had become central to the Democrats' political project, Harris was the second Black woman to serve in the Senate and the first South Asian person to do so. On the Judiciary Committee, she sat next to Cory Booker, of New Jersey, and Mazie Hirono, of Hawaii; Harris nicknamed their trio the P.O.C.s. Hirono told me that a constituent contacted her office to ask if they had been forced to sit together: \"We said, 'No, that's because we are the most recent additions to that committee.' But that gives you an idea of how long it took for P.O.C.s to be on that committee.\"\n\nHarris had barely settled in when the next Presidential race began. She launched her campaign in January, 2019, before a crowd of more than twenty thousand. But, almost immediately, she struggled to specify her positions on polarizing issues-health care, immigration, defense, the environment. She tried using her old slogan, \"No false choices,\" but it came off as vague and calculating. As Democrats called to reduce prison populations and to address racial disparities in criminal justice, she described herself as a \"progressive prosecutor,\" but her record didn't really match the mood. \"You got the sense that she ran because she could, but that her advisers told her, 'Just take a left turn everywhere and you'll get to where you want to be,' \" David Axelrod said. \"She did not sound connected to the words she was speaking, and that is deadly in a race for President.\" Bakari Sellers, a co-chair of the 2020 campaign, told me that the mistake was trying to shape the candidate to suit the discourse. \"We bubble-wrapped her and didn't give the world a chance to see who she is,\" he said. \"It was a campaign that listened to social media, really. I think the misdiagnosis was 'Twitter is real life.' \" Harris dropped out before the Iowa caucuses.\n\nBiden had promised to choose a woman as Vice-President, but there were other strong contenders: Senator Elizabeth Warren, Governor Whitmer, and Susan Rice, the former national-security adviser. Only seven of the forty-odd members of the California Democratic delegation had endorsed Harris; some of her fellow-officials considered her a ruthless operator. A number of Biden's confidants were bothered that she had attacked him during the debates, for opposing busing programs decades earlier. Ron Klain saw that as an asset, though. \"My view was, That's what debates are for, and it shows her skill as a candidate,\" he said.\n\nProspective running mates are expected not to lobby too avidly, but Harris \"worked her phone incessantly, speed-dialing officials and donors close to Biden,\" according to the book \"Lucky,\" by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, on the 2020 campaign. She had notable advantages: three statewide election victories, experience managing a department of justice with forty million people under its remit. Also, the congressman James Clyburn, of South Carolina-who had given Biden the endorsement that rescued his campaign-had taken to saying that picking a Black woman would be a \"plus.\" (Activists were blunter: they circulated a video in which Black women, recalling that Biden had promoted harsh anti-crime bills, told him, \"You owe us.\") Privately, Biden had a pollster test the top names. Harris came out best. A prominent Democrat told me, \"Biden chose her for specific political reasons at the moment. He was a nearly eighty-year-old white moderate who was trying to win over a party in the post-Floyd frenzy.\"\n\nBiden had sometimes felt slighted during his own years as Vice-President, and in the White House he took pains to involve Harris. \"Even when he might've been frustrated from time to time with a direction she wanted to go, he was always very attuned to making it understood in the building that he viewed her as a partner,\" the former official said. Biden gave her a portfolio much like the one that he'd had, which included working to expand voting rights and to address the root causes of immigration from Central America.\n\nBut both issues had become far more intractable than when Biden had first approached them. During the Trump era, Republicans had ramped up efforts to restrict voting, and worsening conditions in Central America had steadily driven more migrants toward the United States. Also, Harris had to cast tiebreaking votes in the Senate, limiting her ability to travel. When she pointed out these complications, though, she sometimes sounded defensive or evasive. In June, 2021, the NBC anchor Lester Holt asked why she hadn't visited the border. Harris threw up her hands and said, \"At some point, you know, I-we are going to the border. We've been to the border.\" Holt noted that she had not, and she replied, \"And I haven't been to Europe!\" The performance was widely criticized, and her relationship with the press has never fully recovered. During the campaign, she often swats away even obvious questions as petty or confusing.\n\nLink copied\n\nFranklin Foer writes in the 2023 book \"The Last Politician,\" on the first years of Biden's Administration, that Harris \"didn't want to work on women's issues or anything to do with race. She wanted her office to be majority female-and to have a Black woman as chief of staff.\" The office, stocked with a number of aides who were new to her, acquired a reputation for dysfunction. In the first eighteen months, Harris parted ways with her chief of staff, her communications director, her domestic-policy adviser, and her national-security adviser.\n\nFormer staffers recalled that, while she could be a warm, familial presence, she could also be withering. Admirers describe her stringency as an expression of high standards. Lateefah Simon, her employee in the D.A.'s office, told me, \"You don't ask anybody in the armed services if their boss is sweet and nice. Their boss has a charge to create excellence.\" The former White House official told me, \"It always read to me as her insecurity. 'I haven't prepared as much as I feel like I should have on this, and if I just come out swinging you'll think I'm tough and smart.' Men generally get away with that way more. Biden does it, too.\"\n\nUnder pressure, Harris had the habits of a streaky point guard: good performances led to good performances, bad ones to bad. As headline writers asked whether the Democrats had a \"Kamala problem,\" she second-guessed herself and worried that she would make mistakes. Yet Harris also showed an aptitude for building alliances within the Party. She didn't deflect critiques onto Biden or distance herself from him as his approval ratings sank. She seemed aware, as Valerie Jarrett put it, that \"the Vice-President is there to be an adviser, to be a surrogate, not to take credit for anything.\"\n\nBehind the scenes, Harris pressed the Administration to talk to people who were usually overlooked. In April, 2021, a jury was preparing to deliver a verdict on Derek Chauvin, the police officer who knelt on the neck of George Floyd, and the White House braced for civil unrest if he was found not guilty. In meetings, Harris poked holes in the plans for a response: \"Have you thought about this? Have you talked to this person?\" One attendee recalled, \"She was very thoughtful about who was going to need to feel like they had been part of how we arrived at these decisions.\" In ways that became clear later, Harris affected some of Biden's most consequential choices: persuading him to aid voting-rights legislation by backing an exception to the Senate filibuster rule; lobbying to nominate Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. Harris also sought out the counsel and friendship of Michelle Obama, one of the Party's singular stars-\"quite wisely, in my opinion,\" Jarrett said, adding, \"They clicked.\" Michelle, who largely disdains politics, would provide an unusual degree of public support.\n\nBy the summer of 2022, Harris's office had stabilized under a new chief of staff, Lorraine Voles, a former aide to Al Gore and Hillary Clinton. Harris had adopted a pragmatic openness to issues around race or gender: her identity, rather than confining her, could give her credibility to fight for the Administration's agenda in public. In May, the leak of a decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization had shown that the Supreme Court intended to end the constitutional right to an abortion. The next night, in a blistering speech, Harris said of Republicans, \"How dare they?\"\n\nHer aides saw an opportunity. Klain told her, \"I think you're uniquely qualified to travel the country and be a spokesperson on this issue.\" He recalled, \"It wasn't a hard sell. She was there already.\" In the year after the Dobbs decision, she held abortion-related events in sixteen states. In St. Paul, Minnesota, she became the first Vice-President to visit an abortion clinic. (It was during this visit that she got to know Governor Tim Walz, who later became her running mate.) She arranged the first White House meeting of abortion providers. She also started pulling together politicians, union heads, and activists from a wide range of liberal causes, sometimes at her residence, urging them to pool assets and techniques. She often used a visual aid-one of her favored Venn diagrams-to show that states seeking to narrow the right to abortion were also narrowing access to voting rights and same-sex marriage.\n\nIn April, 2023, Harris made a last-minute trip to Tennessee to meet with young Black lawmakers who had been expelled from the Republican-controlled General Assembly, for protesting in favor of gun control after a school shooting. In an impassioned speech, she linked gun violence to broader threats against freedom, saying that a democracy must insure that \"children should be able to live and be safe.\" Representative Clyburn, watching the talk, sensed a change in Harris's standing. \"In the middle of that speech,\" he later told an audience, \"I said, 'She has arrived.' \"\n\nRepublicans responded to Harris's sudden candidacy with a panicky barrage of insults. In September, Trump told a rally in Las Vegas, \"She's a Marxist, communist, fascist person.\" Senator Lindsey Graham called her policy ideas \"batshit crazy.\" Tucker Carlson compared her to the Cambodian dictator Pol Pot.\n\nBut the invective obscured a salient truth: many people were still unclear about where Harris stood on some of the central issues. As President, she would have to grapple immediately with hard problems-the economy, the border, China, Russia, the Middle East. Would her positions owe more to Biden or to Berkeley? A former Obama Administration official, now in finance, told me that his firm spends tens of thousands of dollars a month on lobbyists and consultants, and yet with \"all these fancy-pants people, former members of Congress, nobody can tell me conclusively what she believes about anything.\"\n\nAs the Harris campaign got under way, she renounced progressive goals that she had endorsed in 2019: Medicare for All, a ban on fracking, decriminalizing illegal border crossings. She now called herself a pragmatic prosecutor, rather than a progressive one. Four years after talking of \"reducing the defense budget and redirecting funding to communities in need,\" she vowed to maintain the \"most lethal fighting force in the world.\" Her allies frame her redrawn positions as evidence of an education in political realism. \"She has learned that you can explore the ideals, and you can talk about them and their merits, but at the end of the day you have to be where people are,\" Sellers told me. \"For me, that's not a flip-flop. That's fucking leadership.\" Another way of putting this is that she is trying to win an election.\n\nWhen pressed, Harris said that her \"values have not changed,\" but hinted that her constituency had. She said on CNN that after \"travelling the country extensively\" she had come to believe that \"it is important to build consensus.\" Harris had been a centrist in California, and now she was trying to be a centrist in national politics. To address immigration, she wanted to revive a bipartisan border bill that Trump had killed; on trade, she was inclined to keep existing tariffs on China, which had been initiated by Trump and continued by Biden, but she rejected Trump's new call for blanket tariffs on foreign imports.\n\nWhen I asked Janet Yellen, Biden's Treasury Secretary, about Trump's effort to portray Harris as a radical, she said, \"There's nothing fringe or out there or Marxist about her view of the economy.\" Yellen has worked with Harris to promote business development among poor and minority populations, and she recalled that Harris cited her mother's experience as a single parent in arguing to make child care less expensive. \"The entire child-care system just doesn't work,\" Yellen said. \"There are chronic costs that have weighed on families and made it almost impossible to lead a middle-class life.\"\n\nMuch of Harris's policy agenda sounded like something you might have heard from Biden, whom a White House colleague once described to me as a \"weathervane for what the center of the left is.\" Unlike Biden, though, Harris has made overtures to the business world. In California, she often took positions favorable to big constituents-Apple, Meta, Alphabet-on issues around innovation and labor practices. When her plan for a federal ban on price gouging was rejected by economists as unworkable, her advisers downplayed the idea. And she said that she would pare back Biden's plan to tax capital gains at higher rates. That move infuriated Morris Pearl, the founder of Patriotic Millionaires, which advocates for higher taxes on the rich. In a statement, he faulted Harris for \"capitulating to the petulant whining of the billionaire class.\"\n\nIt's easy to imagine that Harris welcomed the criticism; eight weeks before the election, a poll found that nearly half of voters considered her \"too liberal.\" Harris has declined to comment on some of the most divisive business issues, such as antitrust policy, leaving her full vision just vague enough to maintain her coalition. Mark Cuban, the investor and television personality, told his social-media followers that Harris was \"more supportive of entrepreneurs than any candidate in a long time.\" Goldman Sachs calculated that her plans would be better than Trump's for growth, inflation, and the budget deficit. Within six weeks of announcing her candidacy, she had matched Trump on the crucial polling question of whom voters trust more to handle the economy.\n\nIn August, Harris was greeted with the biggest rally crowd of the campaign: fifteen thousand people, jammed into an airport hangar in Detroit. She was midway through her routine-reminding the crowd that, as a prosecutor, she knows \"Donald Trump's type\"-when hecklers started shouting, \"Kamala, Kamala, you can't hide, we won't vote for genocide!\" Michigan is home to one of America's largest Muslim communities, and in the primaries Biden's support for Israel's war in Gaza had led to the worst performance there for an incumbent Democrat since Jimmy Carter.\n\nHarris gave the protesters a moment-\"I'm here because we believe in democracy,\" she said-but when the outcry continued she grew impatient. She narrowed her eyes and said, \"You know what? If you want Donald Trump to win, then say that! Otherwise, I'm speaking.\" When the clip spread, Harris was broadly criticized from the left for the first time since her campaign began. (The writer Peter Beinart called her comment \"stupid and heartless,\" adding, \"Why not acknowledge that what's happening in Gaza is horrifying, and say you want to beat Donald Trump so you can stop it.\") Harris quickly made adjustments. Two days later, when protesters interrupted her in Arizona, she said calmly, \"We're here to fight for our democracy, which includes respecting the voices that I think we're hearing from.\" Then she went for a balance: \"Now is the time to get a ceasefire deal and get the hostage deal done.\" The uproar passed.\n\nHarris had to decide if such demonstrators were vocal outliers or representatives of a voting bloc that could swing the election. She was relying especially on overwhelming support from young people, to counteract Trump's lead with older Americans. Not long after the protest in Michigan, researchers at the University of Chicago released a national poll. Although forty-eight per cent of respondents under twenty-seven disapproved of Biden's handling of the war in Gaza, only eleven per cent said that it made them less likely to vote for Harris. Over all, respondents were far more concerned about inflation, housing costs, abortion, immigration, and inequality.\n\nOn the Middle East, as in other areas of foreign policy, Harris hopes to be seen as a skeptical heir to Biden and Obama-ideologically similar but hardened by their mistakes. Phil Gordon, Harris's national-security adviser, opposes attempts at regime change but has argued for the finite use of force; he faulted Obama for not bombing Syria after Bashar al-Assad crossed Obama's \"red line\" by using chemical weapons. Compared with Biden, who has known Benjamin Netanyahu for nearly half a century, Harris has treated the Israeli Prime Minister coolly. (Asked on \"60 Minutes\" if he was a \"close ally,\" Harris suggested that the more important alliance was \"between the American people and the Israeli people.\") And, unlike Biden, she does not typically see the great global challenge as democracy versus dictatorship; democracy is too wounded in Israel, Turkey, and other U.S. allies to sustain the distinction. Instead, with a lawyer's eye, she tends to criticize violations of the law, such as China's seizure of territory in the South China Sea. She also talks of forming closer ties among traditional allies in Africa, Southeast Asia, and Latin America, where China and Russia have increased their influence.\n\nHarris came to Washington with scant foreign-policy experience. One expert who briefed her while she was in the Senate described her as a \"complete blank page.\" Since then, she has spent nearly four years seated alongside Biden in the Situation Room. She has met scores of foreign leaders and developed a diplomatic style that observers describe as focussed and direct-devoid of the small talk that Biden savors. A European official who met with her was surprised at how \"inquisitive\" she seemed. \"She didn't put herself forward as 'I am the Vice-President of the most powerful country in the world.' She showed herself in a very humble and very open way,\" he said.\n\nHarris the messenger sometimes makes a deeper impression than her message. In 2021, when she visited Guatemala and bluntly discouraged potential migrants by telling them, \"Do not come,\" American immigration-rights groups were furious. But Jorge Guajardo, a former Mexican diplomat, told me that the comment caused her no real damage. \"It's not any different from what we've been hearing from Americans throughout the decades,\" he said. On the contrary, he went on, Harris has become popular among people in Latin America. \"The political leaders of the region mostly would support a President Trump because they can deal with him-they know they will never be challenged by him on democracy, on corruption, on nepotism, on anything. But I think society would largely prefer President Kamala. She represents everything that the region aspires to.\"\n\nNaming a new Presidential candidate barely a hundred days before the election sent waves of disorientation throughout the Democratic Party. At the Convention, in Chicago, the official printed platform still contained numerous mentions of a \"President Biden second term.\" Lobbyists, milling around over drinks, complained that they didn't know which of Harris's aides to schmooze.\n\nBut the Convention also showed signs of Harris's imprint on the Party's culture. Emhoff, the Second Gentleman, delivered what amounted to a wedding toast about a midlife marriage. His son, Cole, said, \"We might not look like other families in the White House, but we're ready to represent all families in America.\" Dana Nessel, Michigan's attorney general, spoke about same-sex marriage, but, instead of offering another grave warning about conservative attacks, she said, \"You can pry this wedding band from my cold, dead, gay hand. And I'm retaining a lot of water, so good luck with that.\" Democrats were gambling that they could motivate more voters with patriotism than with fear. Delegates waved \"U.S.A.\" signs, and speakers talked about the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, and the American Revolution. At an after-party, Wyclef Jean, the Haitian American musician, played \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" and said, \"You know what makes America great? We're a bunch of immigrants.\"\n\nOn the sidelines, where people pored over arcane PowerPoints of voter data, the mood was grimmer. One of the greatest worries was that Harris might ultimately fall short with workers in Midwestern factory towns, the kinds of places that Klain described as the fulcrum of the race-Flint, Manitowoc, Altoona. In a dreary hotel meeting room, a small group of Convention attendees got a briefing on the Democrats' chances in the region. Celinda Lake, a prominent pollster, asked, \"How do we bring these voters back?\" She added, \"If we don't figure out that strategy, we're not going to be winning these states anymore.\"\n\nThere were some encouraging signs. Lake's polls and focus groups in factory towns found that people could go left or right. They resent corporate greed and price gouging; they rely on Social Security and Medicare; they like Biden's reduction in the price of prescription drugs and his efforts to revive manufacturing. Harris was hoping to reach working-class voters by focussing on the cost of living. She talked of expanding tax credits-including six thousand dollars for parents of newborns and twenty-five thousand for first-time home buyers-and of extending capped drug prices to people without Medicare. (The Harvard economist Jason Furman, who served in the Obama Administration, called her program \"populism lite.\") But the residents of factory towns still see Democrats as \"obsessed with L.G.B.T. transgender issues,\" Lake said. \"People believe that we are constantly bringing it up, that we care about it more than the economy.\" I asked what those voters said about Harris. Mike Lux, a Democratic strategist, answered, \"They knew who Joe Biden was, that he was a working-class kid, that he cared about them, even if they didn't necessarily agree with him or blamed him for inflation. They don't feel like they know Kamala Harris at all.\"\n\nA day after Harris's rally in Michigan, she and Walz were due to speak at a union hall in Wayne, not far from Detroit. The United Auto Workers Local 900 sits across from a Ford plant and has a large sign in the parking lot that reads \" NO FOREIGN VEHICLES ALLOWED ON THIS PROPERTY .\" I'd arrived early (in a domestic car) and saw a hundred or so union members, many of whom work on Broncos or Rangers or electric batteries. The U.A.W. had endorsed Harris for President. David Green, who worked at a plant in Ohio before becoming a union leader, told me that Trump's allure had faded when he failed to keep a promise to save imperilled G.M. plants. \"Trump was telling people, 'Don't sell your houses. All these jobs, they're all coming back.' Two years later, the plant closed. People lost their fucking jobs. The hospital I was born in, Northside Hospital, closed. The barber shop I used to go to shut down.\" He added, \"I wrote him letters. I got nothing.\" But Mark Gibson, a union leader at a diesel plant, still saw Trump's effect on people. \"We got guys coming to our plant in their twenties, and they have their opinions,\" he said. \"They're getting on a bandwagon with something. They're reciting those sound bites. \"\n\nBefore Biden ran for President, every Democratic ticket for three decades had included a graduate of Harvard or Yale. Harris and Walz extended the turn away from the Ivy League. When they arrived at Local 900, Shawn Fain, the president of the U.A.W., introduced them by saying, \"They have working-class roots. They know struggle.\" Walz, who often speaks with the amplitude of a man dismissing a pep rally in an orderly fashion, gave Fain a bro hug and greeted the audience as \"sisters and brothers.\" As a teacher, he belonged to a union for decades. His candidacy defied the Washington wisdom; many analysts had argued that Harris should choose Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania, the swing state with the most electoral votes. But Walz provided, at least within the ambit of centrist Democratic policies, a way to avoid \"false choices.\" He is a military veteran and a hunter who wants more gun control, and a progressive who makes videos about the best way to clean a gutter or a carburetor-ordinary activities that become striking when you try to picture Bill Clinton doing them. Walz implored the autoworkers to spread the word about what Democrats have done for working people. \"This is a bit of preaching to the choir,\" he said, \"but the choir needs to sing right now.\"\n\nHarris looked less comfortable; her working-class roots are mostly among the low-paid but high-status workers of academia. She started by saying, \"Can we hear it again for Tim Walz? Isn't he spectacular?\" But, once she settled in, I heard her reach, for the first time in weeks, for a transcendent note in a speech. \"There's some perversion that's happened in our country in the last several years, where there's a suggestion that somehow strength is about making people feel small, making people feel alone,\" she said. \"But isn't that the very opposite of what we know-unions know-to be strength? It's about the collective. It's about understanding that no one should ever be made to fight alone.\"\n\nShe was trying to make the case that her politics of inclusion went beyond \"L.G.B.T. transgender issues,\" as Lake had put it. White factory workers in Wayne were part of the coalition, too. Toward the end of her speech, she said, \"I understand the concept, the noble concept, behind collective bargaining. And here it is-fairness.\" She went on, \"Isn't that what we're talking about in this election? We're saying, 'We just want fairness.' \"\n\nHarris and Walz were arguing against cynicism, against Trump's nihilism, against his poisonous projection that optimism is weakness, that cruelty is intelligent. Nearly a decade ago, when Trump entered politics, liberals took to circulating a passage by the late philosopher Richard Rorty. In 1998, Rorty reasoned that members of \"labor unions, and unorganized and unskilled workers, will sooner or later realize that their government is not even trying to prevent wages from sinking or to prevent jobs from being exported.\" He predicted that they would find \"a strongman to vote for-someone willing to assure them that, once he is elected, the smug bureaucrats, tricky lawyers, overpaid bond salesmen, and postmodernist professors will no longer be calling the shots.\" But it is only now that the Democrats are starting to heed the key prescription that came with Rorty's diagnosis: the left must reclaim patriotism from the right. He wrote, \"National pride is to countries what self-respect is to individuals, a necessary condition for self-improvement.\"\n\nTrump has had little use for national pride in the final months of the campaign. Fear has always been his primary instrument, and he has deployed it to summon ever more lurid fictions about immigrants. Recently, he told a crowd in Michigan, \"They grab young girls and slice them up right in front of their parents.\" In Wisconsin, he warned of outsiders who come to \"rape, pillage, thieve, plunder, and kill.\" Moreover, he threatened to imprison his opponents, including Democratic donors, lawmakers, and Harris herself.\n\nWhen Trump won, in 2016, Obama wondered to aides, \"What if we were wrong?\" Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national-security adviser, recently explained, \"He was basically saying, 'What if we were wrong about the inexorable progress toward multiracial democracy?' \" But if Harris wins, Rhodes said, \"it may end up that Trump, not Obama, is the weird parenthesis in history.\"\n\nOn the other hand, if Trump returns to the White House-and especially if he does so after losing the popular vote again-the voters who thrilled to Harris's sudden ascent will be profoundly demoralized. Already, according to the University of Chicago poll, fifty-eight per cent of young people say that American democracy isn't working. Rhodes told me, \"I think the Democratic Party would have an internal reckoning of a kind that we haven't had in my memory.\"\n\nIf that pressure weighs on Harris, she has seemed determined to make use of it, allowing herself to convey more gravity than joy. On the first Friday in October, she was back in Michigan, speaking to a gathering at a firehouse. \"We have thirty-two days,\" she reminded the crowd. \"And we are the underdog.\"\n\nBy late afternoon, she was in Flint, in a minor-league hockey arena. Backstage, in a makeshift photo studio with an American flag and a blue curtain, she stood in stilettos on a stained concrete floor. Locals lined up for pictures with her. Every politician has a characteristic style for such moments. Biden tends to chat so long that event organizers have to rerun the soundtrack. Harris is welcoming but efficient: a smile, a word, a subtle straightening of the spine that cues the photographer to wrap it up by saying, \"Look right this way!\"\n\nOne after another, people came with their rehearsed lines, searching her face for a connection. A woman from Pakistan, gesturing to her earrings, said, \"For you, I wore my jhumkas ,\" and Harris leaned in to demonstrate appreciation. Another woman, in a white hijab, spoke rapidly and quietly about the Middle East, while Harris nodded. Then, perhaps a beat earlier than the guests would have liked, the photographer called, \"Look right this way!\"\n\nThere is no hyperbole in the observation that any handful of those voters, or the millions like them, has the power to tip the country's fortunes. The Midwest is so evenly divided that in 2020 Biden and Harris won Wisconsin by an average of just three votes in each of the state's roughly seven thousand wards-a difference small enough to hinge on a flat tire or a flu on Election Day.\n\nI thought back to Gordon-Reed's mention of politics as contingency. Just as a confluence of circumstances had lifted Harris to the doorstep of history, any mishap seemed capable of turning her away. Hurricanes ravaged the Gulf Coast and Appalachia; Israel and Iran careered toward war. Trump used each event to insist that the country was falling into chaos. But other facts were on Harris's side: a deal that ended a dockworkers' strike, a jobs report that proved the strength of the economy. Her campaign strategy barely budged. It rested on the proposition that Harris-still unfamiliar to many voters-was more appealing than the man who has occupied so much of the national psyche for the past eight years.\n\nAfter the photos, it was time for Harris's speech. She walked through a cinder-block hallway and took her position just offstage, shadowed by Secret Service agents and a man in a headset. For a moment, she stood behind heavy curtains that separated her from the crowd. By her shoulder, a monitor depicted the people on the other side-a roomful of weary, wary voters hoping that they had found a candidate who would carry the country forward. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Kamala Harris for President\n\nAt the 1940 Republican National Convention, in Philadelphia, an uneasy affair marked by bomb scares, a British espionage scandal, and the imminence of global conflict, ten names were placed in nomination. On the sixth ballot, a corporate executive from Indiana named Wendell Willkie finally emerged as the challenger to Franklin Delano Roosevelt , who was running for a third term. Desperate to find a way to compete with F.D.R., a political colossus who had lately engineered the New Deal and ended the Great Depression, Willkie challenged him to a series of radio debates.\n\nThis was something new in American life. F.D.R. hardly feared the medium-he'd been delivering his homey yet substance-rich fireside chats to the nation since 1933-but he nonetheless dodged Willkie's invitation, citing scheduling conflicts. In November, he crushed Willkie, and by the end of 1941 he was engaged in the struggle against fascism .\n\nThe 2024 election also comes at a moment of national crisis. This time, however, the threat to the country's future-to its rule of law and its democratic institutions, its security and its character-resides not in a foreign capital but at a twenty-acre Xanadu on the Florida coast. For nine years, Donald Trump has represented an ongoing assault on the stability, the nerves, and the nature of the United States. As President, he amplified some of the ugliest currents in our political culture: nativism, racism , misogyny, indifference to the disadvantaged, amoral isolationism. His narcissism and casual cruelty, his contempt for the truth, have contaminated public life. As Commander-in-Chief, he ridiculed the valor of fallen soldiers, he threatened to unravel the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and he emboldened autocrats everywhere, including Vladimir Putin , Kim Jong Un, and Viktor Orbán . When Trump lost to Joe Biden, in 2020, he tried every means possible to deny the will of the electorate and helped incite a violent insurrection on Capitol Hill.\n\nIn contrast, the Democratic Party's nominee, Vice-President Kamala Harris , has displayed the basic values and political skills that would enable her to build on the successes of the Biden Administration and to help end, once and for all, a poisonous era defined by Trump. Few, if any, of our readers will be surprised that we endorse Harris in this election-but many would have been surprised, earlier this year, that the choice would end up being between Trump and the Vice-President. The change in the Democratic candidate is the result, of course, of a debate of the sort that F.D.R. sidestepped.\n\nDuring the past half century, these quadrennial confrontations have become a centerpiece of election season-a chance to glimpse the choice in real time, side by side. Aficionados may know the highlights of debates past: Ronald Reagan , at the age of seventy-three, joking nimbly that he would not \"exploit\" the \"youth and inexperience\" of his fifty-six-year-old opponent, Walter Mondale; George H. W. Bush glancing at his watch after Bill Clinton answered a question from the audience; Mitt Romney assuring the country that, far from being a sexist, he had, in fact, \"whole binders full of women\" he had consulted for his gubernatorial cabinet.\n\nYet no debates have been as unusual or as consequential as the two we have just witnessed. The first -on June 27th, in Atlanta, between Trump and President Biden-proved to be an unmasking. On a human level, Biden's nationally televised disintegration was a poignant spectacle. Viewed more coldly, it was a gift. Had it taken place, say, after the Conventions, it might have been too late to force a reassessment.\n\nIt was hardly a secret that Biden has aged, growing markedly less robust, particularly in the past eighteen months or so. If he got through an interview or a (rare) press conference without incident, staff and supporters exhaled and treated it as a victory. But, rather than open the gate to a younger generation of Democratic candidates, Biden, his advisers, and the Party leadership stood in the way. They made it plain that a challenger would inevitably be defeated. Meanwhile, through spin and deft scheduling, the White House staff protected the President and hoped for the best. Tens of millions of voters, fearing another Trump Presidency, had little choice but to close their eyes and think of America.\n\nBut staying the course was, as the polls were suggesting, probably a doomed strategy. In an attempt to invigorate the campaign, Biden and his team took the risk of challenging Trump to an early debate. Perhaps a forceful, coherent performance would diminish the doubts about the President's capacity to govern well into his mid-eighties. It was not to be. The debate, broadcast on CNN, was a humbling. Biden's resting expression of slack confusion was almost as unnerving as his faltering efforts to make a clear and vivid case for his reëlection. When Jake Tapper asked him about the national debt, he delivered a wobbly reply that concluded, \"Look, if-we finally beat Medicare.\" After Biden gave a similarly jumbled response to a question about immigration, Trump said only, \"I really don't know what he said at the end of that sentence. I don't think he knows what he said, either.\" By Trumpian standards, this was a kindness. It was also the end of the Biden candidacy.\n\nFor the next twenty-four days, the President travelled a hard road from denial to acceptance. All of us face the assault of time, but few must reckon with mortality before the eyes of the world. Biden loves the job and thought he was uniquely positioned to defeat Trump once more. But finally, after absorbing discouragement from Nancy Pelosi , Chuck Schumer, the Obamas, and others, Biden, in an act of grace, issued a letter concluding that it was \"in the best interest of my party and the country for me to stand down.\" In a separate message, he gave his endorsement to Kamala Harris.\n\nThe second Presidential debate, at the National Constitution Center, in Philadelphia, was an unmasking of another kind. For some time, observers have asked whether Trump, who is now seventy-eight, has himself suffered from some form of decline. On a given day, it is hard to determine if a particular insult, lie, or rant represents his usual malevolence or something else. Not long before the debate, Trump took to speculating whether it would be preferable, in the event of finding oneself on a sinking boat, to die by shark attack or by electrocution from the boat's battery. (\"I'll take electrocution every single time,\" he assured a grateful nation.) There is nothing he will not say. When a group of Proud Boys were convicted of conspiracy last year, he warned that the F.B.I. and the Justice Department were just getting started: \" get smart america, they are coming after you !!!\" Trump has defied multiple legal gag orders, attacking judges and jurors, and has even blamed the latest attempt on his life, a deeply alarming event, not on the would-be assailant or the easy availability of assault weapons but on the Democratic ticket.\n\nFor Harris, the debate presented an opportunity to expose Trump at his worst. All she had to do was to prick his vanity. Trump's rallies were boring, she suggested. Military leaders thought he was a \"disgrace.\" Foreign leaders ate his lunch, considered him weak, laughed at him. With growing rage, Trump began howling from a familiar hymnal. America is a \"failing nation.\" Migrants are pouring in from \"prisons and jails, from mental institutions and insane asylums.\" Indelibly, Trump picked up on a racist, J. D. Vance -endorsed conspiracy theory about Haitian migrants in Ohio and gave it his full voice:\n\nIn Springfield, they're eating the dogs . The people that came in. They're eating the cats . They're eating the pets of the people that live there. And this is what's happening in our country. And it's a shame.\n\nTrump went on in this vein of fact-free bluster, bringing discomfort even to some fellow-Republicans. He had been calling Harris \"dumb as a rock\" and \"unable to speak properly without a teleprompter\" or even \"put two sentences together,\" while mocking her looks, her family, her racial identity, her personal life. He refused to pronounce her name correctly. Harris decided to flick all that lint from her shoulder. She left it to the moderators to correct Trump's facts and the electorate to behold his lunacy. It was a performance that had the potential to lay bare Trump's character for those voters who might not have been paying much attention. After the debate, Trump, of course, declared a \" BIG WIN ,\" but he then issued a loser's proclamation: \" there will be no third debate. \" Some days later, he had more to say about that night, particularly about an endorsement that came his opponent's way minutes after the debate's conclusion. On his social-media platform, he wrote, \" i hate taylor swift !\"\n\nIn the fall of 2016, the editors of The New Yorker published an enthusiastic endorsement of Hillary Clinton:\n\nOn November 8th, barring some astonishment, the people of the United States will, after two hundred and forty years, send a woman to the White House. The election of Hillary Clinton is an event that we will welcome for its immense historical importance, and greet with indescribable relief. It will be especially gratifying to have a woman as commander-in-chief after such a sickeningly sexist and racist campaign, one that exposed so starkly how far our society has to go.\n\nThe lack of sufficient caution remains, well, an astonishment. We all learned a painful lesson. Trump has never won the national popular vote, and the elections of 2018 and 2020 were setbacks for the Republicans; in 2022, the anticipated \"red wave\" failed to materialize. And yet in rural towns, in struggling deindustrialized cities, in the South and the Midwest, his popularity is broad and deep. His strength among Black and Latino men has grown. He has the ardent backing of tech billionaires like Elon Musk , right-wing legal activists like Leonard Leo, and no small number of Wall Street executives whose highest priorities are to prevent regulation and changes to their tax status. Coming out of the Democratic National Convention , and then the September 10th debate, Harris made extraordinary inroads with the electorate; she's got the \"vibes,\" as this year's cliché has it. But the race remains very close. In both 2016 and 2020, Trump outperformed the polls. No responsible assessment of the contest has the luxury of focussing only on the imperatives for a Harris Administration and gliding past the ramifications of another Trump Administration.\n\nThere's every reason to think that Trump II would be far worse than Trump I. Twice impeached, found liable for sexual abuse, convicted of thirty-four felony counts, and facing many more state and federal charges, Trump would return to the White House in a spirit of vengeance. He would immediately set about betraying his oath to \"preserve, protect, and defend\" the Constitution and wage battle against the independence of the Department of Justice in order to preserve, protect, and defend himself. He has made it clear that he would also use the powers at his disposal to punish his opponents. And this time there would be no advisers who would rein him in.\n\nTrump is a menacing presence in American life, and most of his former associates know it. Of his forty-two former Cabinet secretaries, only half have endorsed him. More than two hundred staffers for four previous Republican Presidents and Presidential candidates have endorsed the Democratic ticket. High-ranking officials who once surrounded Trump-including former Vice-President Mike Pence , former Defense Secretaries Jim Mattis and Mark Esper, former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, the former chief of staff John Kelly, the former national-security advisers John Bolton and H. R. McMaster, and the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley-regard him as unfit, a threat to national security.\n\nTrump's campaign has centered on immigration. His first-term abominations included family separation, the Muslim ban, and the decimation of the refugee and asylum system. Now he and advisers like Stephen Miller want to carry out mass deportations reminiscent of the Eisenhower Administration's \"Operation Wetback,\" promising the creation of vast internment camps for undocumented immigrants. Such efforts would require the participation of the Department of Defense and the National Guard. These goals are not only unrealistic; they're undemocratic.\n\nThere are more than eleven million undocumented immigrants living in the United States; at least sixty per cent of them have lived here for more than a decade. Under Trump, federal agents would target anyone they could, without clear guidelines or priorities. This policy would tear apart families, unleash fear in immigrant communities, and lead to racial profiling and discrimination.\n\nA second Trump Administration also augurs economic disaster. His promised tax cuts would hollow out the government's finances, especially if he manages to enact the escalating measures that he has promised while campaigning, such as making Social Security benefits tax-free. Then, there's his plan to impose tariffs of up to twenty per cent on imports, plus much higher duties on anything made in China. According to credible economic models, this would bring a resurgence of inflation, raising the cost of living for those least able to afford it.\n\nTrump's effect on the judiciary would be no less alarming. In his first term, he appointed three Supreme Court Justices, who played an essential role in eliminating the constitutional right to an abortion. Twenty-two states have since either restricted the procedure or banned it outright, and states in the latter category (including Tennessee, Louisiana, and Mississippi) have some of the country's highest rates of maternal and infant mortality.\n\nNor is this the only respect in which Trump's judicial appointments have imperilled public health and safety. The judges he named to the federal bench have continued his campaign of regulatory sabotage. A series of recent Supreme Court rulings have invited polluting industries to challenge pretty much any rule, old or new, that they don't like.\n\nDespite such rulings-and despite a recklessly expansive opinion about Presidential immunity-Trump has sometimes complained that the Court remains insufficiently compliant. Three Justices are currently in their seventies; if Trump gets another round of picks, he is likely to make personal loyalty a deciding factor. Notwithstanding a constitutional duty to \"take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,\" he has indicated that, once in office, he would dismiss federal criminal cases pending against him, and, with the help of a suitably pliable Attorney General, he would almost certainly fire the special counsel Jack Smith. \"I have the absolute right to pardon myself,\" Trump has said. A subservient Justice Department and judiciary could readily be enlisted in his vendettas: Trump-who has insinuated that Mark Milley should have been executed for disloyalty-has also said that he might well prosecute political opponents, including Joe Biden.\n\nTrump's record on the environment is the worst of any President in modern history. His Administration rolled back nearly a hundred regulations aimed at protecting the nation's air, water, and wildlife. It dismantled Obama-era efforts to limit greenhouse-gas emissions and withdrew the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement. Trump's Department of the Interior rushed to lease public lands for oil and gas drilling, and his Department of Energy worked methodically to weaken efficiency standards. A 2020 analysis by the Rhodium Group estimated that the Trump Administration's actions would result in the release of an extra 1.8 billion tons of CO 2 by 2035, a planetarily disastrous outcome. And Trump has continued to scoff at climate science. Talking to Elon Musk, in August, he asserted that one impact of sea-level rise would be the creation of \"more oceanfront property.\"\n\nDiscussion about foreign policy in this election season has been, as always, limited at best. Trump's pronouncements are either flip (\"I don't give a shit about nato \") or dismaying in both their specifics and their evasions. With respect to the horrific events of the past year in the Middle East-the Hamas attack on October 7th, in which twelve hundred people were killed and more than two hundred taken hostage, and Israel's subsequent war in Gaza, which has left more than forty thousand Palestinians dead and countless people displaced-Trump's response is that it \"would have never happened\" if he had been in office. When he was in the White House, he presided over the signing of the Abraham Accords, which promised a new era in relations between Israel and more of its Arab neighbors but paid almost no attention to the rights and the future of the Palestinian people.\n\nIn the recent debate, Trump was asked simply if he wanted Ukraine to prevail against its invader, Putin's Russia. Trump, who appears to prefer aggressive Russian authoritarianism to Ukraine's evolving democracy, could not bring himself to answer in the affirmative and convey support for Ukraine's struggle to preserve its sovereignty and independence. Indeed, Trump radiates contempt for Ukraine's President, Volodymyr Zelensky, who failed to deliver on Trump's thuggish demand, in 2019, that, in exchange for weapons shipments already earmarked for Kyiv, he investigate the Biden family. Putin, who has shredded nascent democratic institutions and procedures in his own country to create a system based solely on his authority, is more Trump's style.\n\nTrump is no more assuring when it comes to China policy. Xi Jinping , whom Trump has recently praised as a \"brilliant guy\" who \"runs 1.4 billion people with an iron fist,\" believes that the world is undergoing a realignment-\"changes unseen in a century.\" Once again, Trump seems uninterested. He has suggested that he might leave Taiwan to fend for itself in the event of a Chinese attack. The island should \"pay us for defense,\" he said. Trump warns of another world war, and yet here, too, his policies seem designed to encourage aggression and destabilize the international order.\n\nIn every arena, there is little question that a Harris Presidency promises far greater sanity and far greater humanity. As recently as three months ago, the Washington cognoscenti cast aspersions on her political skills. These quickly evaporated as Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz , the shrewd and appealing governor of Minnesota, have rapidly proved to be effective campaigners. Their swift transformation of the Democratic Party's prospects for November has been astonishing. Harris deserves enormous credit for stepping fearlessly into the role that fate has dealt her. In the face of a malign opponent, she has behaved with poise, conviction, and intelligence. Of course, her ability to carry out her policy ambitions would improve immeasurably with the election of Democratic majorities in the House and the Senate. But, whatever the circumstances, her positions on the critical issues are rational, undergirded by a basic sense of decency, and often compelling.\n\nWhere Trump promises mass deportations, she has expressed support both for boosting border enforcement and for opening avenues that would lead to legal immigration. The refugee program, which is both a moral imperative and a pragmatic tool of U.S. foreign policy, has grown substantially during the Biden-Harris Administration. The government has also tempered interior enforcement, allowing the large undocumented population, particularly those with families and deep ties to local communities, to live without constant fear of arrest and deportation.\n\nThe Biden-Harris record on asylum at the border is mixed, partly because the policy solutions are far more complex. Harris has said that she would support a bipartisan Senate bill that drastically curtails asylum, and, in the current climate, support for that bill is politically expedient. But there is good reason to believe that, if elected, Harris could be pushed to combine increasing vigilance at the border with more policies that would provide relief to those in desperate need. She has been clear that she would protect undocumented families and find ways to bring a sense of compassion to the immigration system. Congress, to be sure, has been a barrier to any meaningful efforts at immigration reform; conservative courts, together with Republican state attorneys general, would try to limit what Harris could do by executive order. But the alternative is unimaginably bad.\n\nOn the subject of economics, Harris's proposals have sometimes lacked detail, but they thoughtfully address concerns of working-class and middle-class Americans, with a particular focus on the cost of housing. President Biden, for his part, has made a concerted effort to reëstablish the Democratic Party's bond with blue-collar voters. He has been unusually pro-union and pro-manufacturing. There's a reason that, after the disastrous first debate, some of the most diehard Biden loyalists were on the Party's left. The inflation that rose earlier in his term-and that his political adversaries have used to define his economic record-has now abated, while Biden can be credited with passing programs that directed federal spending toward badly needed infrastructure projects and green-energy projects. The U.S. is currently leading its peers in the rate of economic growth.\n\nOwing to Senate opposition, Biden has struggled to follow through on his ambition to bolster the \"care economy,\" through paid family leave, child tax credits, and other measures. Although Harris has pulled back from Biden's positions in certain areas-she favors, for example, a more modest corporate tax increase-these family-relief programs are the part of Biden's agenda that she is most enthusiastic about. She will push hard for them, alongside her initiatives aimed at easing the housing crisis.\n\nFor the Harris campaign, the most emotionally galvanizing issue has been abortion. This will be the first Presidential election since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Close to ninety million women have registered to vote this November, and historical data show that women have favored Democrats over Republicans in every general election since 1992. As Vice-President, Harris has emerged as a leading voice on abortion, framing it powerfully as a matter of bodily autonomy and a right to health care. She has called for concrete policy changes, such as reinstating federal protections for abortion, and has never shied away from making forceful statements on the issue. In March, Harris toured a Planned Parenthood clinic in Minnesota, becoming the first Vice-President to make a public appearance at an abortion provider.\n\nLeaders in the field of women's health have praised her directness and see it as a welcome change from Biden's wavering stance. (In this year's State of the Union address, he failed to say the word \"abortion\" once, even though it was included in his prepared remarks.) As a senator, she sponsored bills designed to improve maternal health and guarantee access to contraception. In 2018, during Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court confirmation hearings, she memorably asked him, \"Can you think of any laws that give government the power to make decisions about the male body?\" She also sought to limit a state's ability to ban abortion unilaterally. \"If there are those who dare to take the freedom to make such a fundamental decision for an individual, which is about one's own body,\" Harris said of abortion rights at a campaign fund-raiser in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, \"what other freedoms could be on the table for the taking?\"\n\nHarris has a reasonably strong environmental record, even if in recent months she has chosen to give it only modest attention. As California's attorney general, she pursued several high-profile cases against polluters, including one against ConocoPhillips for endangering water supplies. In 2016, she sued the Obama Administration over a plan to allow offshore fracking in the Santa Barbara Channel. (A federal judge sided with Harris, and an injunction remains in place.) In the Senate, she promoted electric school buses and was an early co-sponsor of a resolution calling for a Green New Deal. Running for President in 2019, Harris, who has called climate change an \"existential threat,\" said that she would ban fracking for oil and gas. She has since reversed that position, but, as Vice-President, she cast the tie-breaking vote for the Inflation Reduction Act, which contains hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of new spending and tax breaks for clean-energy projects.\n\nOn foreign policy, Harris, who has spent many hours in national-security briefings, speaks the language of liberal internationalism, echoing Biden's policies, from Ukraine to the Middle East. But she is of a different generation than Biden. We can reasonably hope that, as she maintains his commitment to traditional allies and alliances, she will also employ American leverage when those allies are acting heedlessly. With respect to Gaza, she has voiced support for two states for two peoples; she has reasserted Israel's right to security while at the same time evoking the \"heartbreaking\" suffering of the Palestinian people, and calling for an immediate end to the war, with a resolution that would enable Palestinians to \"realize their right to dignity, security, freedom, and self-determination.\" But she also will need to act decisively in the United States' interest when dealing with someone like Benjamin Netanyahu, who has frequently given American Presidents the back of his hand while benefitting immensely from American support.\n\nWith regard to China, Harris is likely to extend Biden's posture of watchful, skeptical competitiveness. A former prosecutor, she often views foreign policy through the lens of international law, and she has rebuked China for expanding its territorial footprint. In 2022, shortly after her first meeting with Xi, when some leaders might have attempted to send reassuring signals, Harris did the opposite: during a visit to the Philippines, she vowed America's support \"in the face of intimidation and coercion in the South China Sea.\"\n\nFour years ago, in our endorsement of Joe Biden, we said that, while he was leading in the polls, we hoped he would displace Trump \"by a margin that prevents prolonged dispute or the kind of civil unrest that Trump appears to relish.\" We know what happened: the margins, in four decisive states, were extremely narrow, and Trump refused to concede. Instead, he levelled wild accusations and filed dozens of lawsuits. When those failed, he called on his MAGA believers to march on the Capitol. This time around, the Trump campaign and various right-wing groups have already deployed deny-the-vote efforts around the country, particularly in swing states like Georgia, Pennsylvania, Nevada, and Arizona. There is every likelihood that, if Trump loses, the drama could go on for weeks or months after Election Day. He has made no secret of the fact that he is willing to use every lever, deploy every dirty trick, political and rhetorical, to bring the country to the brink once more.\n\nAnd so the choice is stark. The United States simply cannot endure another four years of Donald Trump. He is an agent of chaos, an enemy of liberal democracy, and a threat to America's moral standing in the world. Kamala Harris-who has shown herself to be sensible, humane, and liberal-minded-is our choice for the Presidency. At the National Constitution Center, in Philadelphia, a few weeks ago, the American people were able to see both the stakes of this election and the vast differences between the candidates. The right choice-the necessary choice-is beyond debate. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "The End of Kamala Harris's Campaign\n\nKamala Harris's bid for the 2024 Presidential election ended late Wednesday afternoon in the Yard of Howard University, her alma mater, in Washington, D.C., where the Election Night party had disbanded inconclusively hours before. It was eighty degrees and beautiful outside, T-shirt weather in November. In front of Frederick Douglass Hall, a sizable crowd gathered again on a grass lawn. Many were Howard University students, but there were also a number of locals who wanted to \"be a part of the little bit of hope that we have left,\" as an attendee named Joanna Blotner, who lived in the neighborhood, told me.\n\n\"I just wanted to see her,\" a Howard computer-science major named Jacob Robertson said. \"I just wanted to see what she has to say.\"\n\nFew of the people I spoke with blamed Harris for the loss. \"I do wish Biden had stepped down sooner,\" Christine Frye told me. \"I do wish the Harris campaign had some more concrete policy proposals, especially when it comes to child care and maternity leave in the country, family paid leave.\" Like other attendees, she came to witness some history and see the end. \"I can't imagine how difficult this is for her,\" a D.C. resident named Bryan Hum told me. \"I just wanted to show our continued support that she's not alone, even in these moments.\"\n\nNow that Donald Trump has won , it seems worth remembering that, until July 20th, when Joe Biden ended his reëlection bid, the former President's return to office had seemed inevitable. Kamala Harris's hundred-and-seven-day campaign might be seen, in the long term, as a glitch in a race that had perhaps been decided for many voters months earlier. The energy, especially among committed Democrats, that followed Harris's nomination-and the tens of thousands of volunteers and hundreds of millions of dollars in donations it generated-now appears to have been a mirage of uplift for the Party's base that failed to win over sufficient numbers of voters who were on the fence.\n\nHarris had held her first campaign rally in a high-school gym in a suburb of Milwaukee on July 23rd. The utterly giddy mood of the rally was enhanced by its improbability. Less than a week had passed since Trump's victorious nomination at the Republican National Convention in the same metro area; the Vice-President's candidacy had been so abrupt that a pop-up tent outside the venue still had Biden's name on it. That visit to Wisconsin marked the first time that voters saw Harris walk out to the triumphant strains of Beyoncé's \"Freedom\"; the first time that they heard the slogan \"We're not going back.\" I observed, in an article I wrote about the event , that the tide of good will would be hers to squander, but this was a campaign event that had been hastily thrown together. One might have expected her rallies to have evolved. Instead, they calcified.\n\nOver the three and a half months that followed, as Harris crisscrossed the swing states, she gave speeches that tended to be highly scripted, consistent, and formulaic. Many of the phrases from the suburban-Milwaukee speech, when she'd had only a few days to prepare, still formed the core of her remarks. At events where one might have anticipated that she'd expand her message, especially the series of huge, star-studded get-out-the-vote rallies toward the end of the campaign, she remained committed to her talking points: \"When we fight, we win\"; \"Hard work is good work.\" Her policy proposals to address price gouging and support first-time home buyers, entrepreneurs, and people caring for elderly family members were enticing but piecemeal. Her promise of an \"opportunity economy\" did not seem to acknowledge the depth of the systemic economic challenges facing the middle and working classes.\n\nYet Harris almost always held the attention of the room. She had good comedic timing and natural charisma. It was not a problem with her delivery. It was a problem with content-there was rarely a moment of rhetorical specificity or material detail. Her refusal to run on her identity as a Black and South Asian woman meant that there was a certain withholding of her own experience. She also avoided specific references to ordinary people and their problems. I often thought of \"A More Perfect Union,\" Barack Obama's speech about race in March, 2008. In her campaign, Harris never attempted to give a speech of such ambition. In late October, in Kalamazoo, Michigan, Michelle Obama delivered an indelible speech about reproductive rights at a Harris rally. Harris's own remarks about reproductive rights, given at a rally in Houston in which Beyoncé appeared the night before, were rote and unmemorable. I thought that maybe I just cared about the writing because I'm a writer. But the vacuity and mass-produced quality of Harris's speeches seemed intentional, a lowest-common-denominator strategy designed to avoid alienating any particular demographic.\n\nWhen you travel a lot, as a reporter who follows a campaign does, you become acutely aware of the consumer value of consistency, the idea that your coffee will taste the same and that your airline won't change its boarding routine. The Harris campaign, in the scripted nature of its speeches, and Harris's avoidance of off-the-cuff interviews for the first several weeks, seemed to follow the same logic: there would be no wild surprises. But this carefully managed formula gave a sense of fragility to the entire enterprise, a feeling that if the wrong thread were pulled the whole thing might start to unravel. Rallies were energized and crowded and fun, with great music, but Harris rarely said anything unexpected at them, so they failed to generate much of an echo beyond the arenas in which they took place. Other speakers at Harris rallies, whether local business owners or students or Samuel L. Jackson, often followed the same script, with only a few personal flourishes to give their words some local flavor. The same was true of Harris's running mate. The Vice-Presidential campaign trail canned Tim Walz's personality and turned him into a caricature of a dad who speaks only in sports metaphors.\n\nAt nearly every Harris rally I attended, whether at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago or at an arena in Savannah, Georgia, a lone protester would stand up in the middle of Harris's speech and call for an end to American support of Israel's bombardment of Gaza. The unease of the crowd every time this happened was palpable. (In Kalamazoo, the audience started booing over a protester. Two men in suits, evidently security, rushed up the steps from the floor of the arena where the protester was standing, held campaign signs up over him as if he could be camouflaged, and led him out.) Harris would typically respond by saying something along the lines of \"We need to end this war and bring the hostages home,\" which only served as a reminder that the Biden-Harris Administration had not managed to do so. Regardless of the extent to which this mattered electorally, it mattered in the rooms in which Harris spoke, where her supporters were asked to ignore the dissonance between the ideals of freedom and democracy in her speeches and the reality on the ground in Gaza.\n\nAs Harris made a bid to appeal to the center, there were many moments in the campaign that rang hollow: when she said, while representing the Party that has aimed to present itself as a leader on climate change and gun safety, that she would not ban fracking, or asserted that she kept a Glock, telling Oprah that \"if somebody breaks in my house, they're getting shot.\" Then there were her appearances with the anti-Trump Republican and former congresswoman Liz Cheney and the pride with which Harris received the endorsement of her father, the Republican former Vice-President Dick Cheney, one of the architects of the Iraq War.\n\nAs the campaign came to a close, celebrities such as Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, Jennifer Lopez, and Tyler Perry lined up to endorse Harris. But in an election that was probably decided on the sense of precarity experienced by many Americans-that a stable career, a secure home, and affordable child care are increasingly elusive; that financial ruin is an accident or illness away-these famous figures did not help the Party reassure a wide swath of voters that it understood what they cared about and needed to hear.\n\nAt Howard, as we waited to hear Harris's concession speech, I asked a few people what they thought the campaign should have done differently. \"I've been door-knocking since I was seventeen,\" Joanna Blotner told me. \"Since 2010, there is a consistent message of just not feeling like votes matter, like anything that happens in Congress or in D.C. has an impact.... So when you talk about democracy being on the line, there's no resonance. They don't see democracy working.\"\n\nBut, for some of the young people there, Harris's efforts would not be forgotten. \"I honestly feel like she did as much as she could do,\" a Howard freshman named Maya Blackston said. \"I think that, in a way, we kind of failed her as a country.\"\n\n\"If she was given more time, I think it could have been way different,\" her friend Nya Young chimed in. Blackston said that she would miss seeing Harris on television. \"She has such a bright, vibrant energy,\" she said. \"It's really sad that we're not gonna get that, we're actually going to get the complete opposite.\"\n\nHarris took to a lectern flanked by American flags twenty-five minutes after 4 P.M. , almost on schedule and without a booster to introduce her. The phones went up in the Howard Yard to record the moment. For the last time, Harris reiterated her message of enthusiasm and joy, her stump-speech line that \"we all have so much more in common than what separates us.\" The campaign slogans were modified to the new reality, I almost couldn't believe I was hearing them once again. She said, \"When we fight, we win,\" adding, \"But here's the thing, here's the thing: sometimes the fight takes a while.\" She ended with a new image, the adage that \"only when it is dark enough can you see the stars.\" The campaign of platitudes concluded with greeting-card sentiment: \"Let us fill the sky with the light of a brilliant, brilliant billion of stars,\" she said. \"The light of optimism, of faith, of truth and service.\" With that, the crowd dispersed, the American flags were lowered and folded, and, as I walked out through the many security barriers surrounding Howard, a campaign bus with its \"New Way Forward\" signage was being driven away. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Madame President: The Cover That Never Was\n\nThe portrait above, \"Kamala,\" painted by Kadir Nelson, would have been the cover of the November 18, 2024, issue of The New Yorker -that is, if Kamala Harris had won the election on November 5th. Instead, late that evening, when it became clear that the vote was going the other way, it was swapped out for a silhouette of soon-to-be President Donald Trump, drawn quickly by Barry Blitt (who is also the artist behind the January 20, 2025, cover about the Inauguration).\n\nThis is not the first would-be Madame President cover in the magazine's history; the first was, of course, in 2016, when a cover of Hillary Clinton was replaced by a cover of a wall . Though this image of Vice-President Harris never made it onto newsstands, the original painting will be on view at an exhibition of New Yorker covers at L'Alliance New York , which opens on January 21st and runs through March 30th.\n\nIn the video below, the artist elaborates on his creative process:\n\nFind covers, cartoons, and more at the Condé Nast Store .\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "A Kamala Harris Canvasser's Education\n\nIn October, as a novice volunteer knocking on doors in Pennsylvania for the Kamala Harris campaign, my task was to make sure that committed Democrats voted, and to persuade undecided voters that Harris was the better choice. I was told not to spend time talking with voters who were clearly supporters of Donald Trump. But there was something about the way one man snarled at me, \"She's evil,\" as he was tending his front lawn on a quiet, tree-shaded street in a suburb of Allentown, that made me stop.\n\nWhen I approached, he seemed to shrink back, but he recovered and told me that Harris was a moral and physical danger to children because she supported public middle schools allowing students to undergo transgender surgery without the consent of their parents. By this time, after two months of canvassing, I had heard from several Trump voters some version of this noxious innuendo. I shrugged, told him his concern was not based on any reality I was aware of, and moved on to the next door on my list.\n\nA few minutes later, another voter on the same street opened his door to declare that he would vote enthusiastically for Harris. He was a pastor in a local Protestant church, and he expressed disbelief that Trump, after his attempt to overthrow the results of the 2020 election, his felony convictions, the court case that found him liable for sexual abuse, and his increasingly erratic and crude behavior, was even close to Harris in the polls. \"How is this possible?\" was the refrain I heard time and again from Democrats.\n\nAllentown is the most populous city in the Lehigh Valley, a forty-mile stretch on the eastern edge of Pennsylvania that follows the path of the Lehigh River. The city's suburbs have a peaceful veneer that belies the tensions on the ground. On a winding rural road, I met an older woman, a registered Democrat, who had volunteered as a poll worker in recent elections. She said that her whole family was under online siege by MAGA militants who were accusing her of preparing to subvert the upcoming count. Another volunteer I met, who had come from Brooklyn with his two pre-teen kids, had been confronted by an armed Trump supporter. The man had claimed to be in charge of security for his neighborhood and said they were barred from entering.\n\nMy own presence in Allentown, where I walked the streets with a green-and-pink shoulder bag carefully selected to convey joyfulness and filled with Harris campaign literature, had followed an abrupt life change. I've been a journalist for four decades, reporting on immigration and other subjects for the Washington Post , The New York Times , and, most recently, The Marshall Project. But, on June 27th, as I watched the debate between President Joe Biden and Trump, I was overcome with dismay. That night, Trump unleashed a barrage of lies about immigrants and asylum seekers. Biden failed to respond with any corrective truths or positive portrayals of immigrant families. A few days later, I resigned from The Marshall Project, as I felt I could no longer comply with its rules proscribing partisan activity. I joined a voter uprising against Biden, writing letters and making calls. My sense of relief when the President stepped aside, on July 21st, became exhilaration when Harris sprinted out of the gate the following day and assumed the Democratic mantle. Just as I was being initiated into the world of political activism, I was presented with a historic chance to help elect America's first woman President. I started canvassing on August 11th.\n\nMy induction took place in Bensalem, a township northeast of Philadelphia, in a spare campaign office still announced by a Biden-Harris yard sign. I received training on a mobile app that would guide my steps, generating for each of my canvassing forays a street map with dots showing the households of registered voters, who were identified by name, age, gender, and party affiliation. The app meant that, when people opened their doors, I could ask to speak with them by their first names. I recorded their responses, indicating whether they were \"strong\" for Harris--definitely voting for her-- \"strong\" for Trump, or were still in some murky terrain of indecision, in which case I was on: I had a minute or two to launch my pitch to sway them. I also received my first training in campaign messaging--a short course on Project 2025 and the catastrophic perils it posed for American democracy.\n\nEven on that first day, walking around in sultry heat, I began to sense a dissonance between the celebrity-inflected exuberance of the Harris campaign and the bleak mood and raw divisions I encountered in the streets. I canvassed a gritty apartment complex, with brown grass in the green spaces, that surrounded a small pool, where several mothers languished as their children splashed. They all scoffed when I asked if they were Harris supporters. By the end of that afternoon, the warnings about Project 2025's plans for an \"authoritarian, Christian nationalist movement with broad control over American life\"-in the words of a flyer I received as part of my \"lit pack\"-felt too academic for a voter with gray and missing teeth who told me she could not afford dental care. By contrast, just blocks away was a curving street lined with colonial-style homes, with Volvos and S.U.V.s in the driveways, where one smiling Democrat after another opened the doors. Here was the class polarization that would later get so much attention.\n\nAs for the Trump voters who turned up on my lists, I quickly understood that we were not operating on a plane of shared facts. A retired police officer shouted me down when I asked him to explain his support for Trump, given that the assault on the Capitol on January 6, 2021, had injured a hundred and forty law enforcement officers. \"That's a lie!\" he said, even though I had, at the ready, the latest Justice Department report on the prosecutions of the rioters. Another voter insisted that all Trump had asked for after the 2020 election was \"a recount\" of the national vote, as if that were a remotely feasible, or legal, proposition. Others echoed Trump's dark visions of millions of criminal migrants rampaging across the land, though there was little sign of them in northeast Pennsylvania. This is what I was up against: Trump was broadcasting on some direct wavelength with his followers, and he had drawn them into his alternate universe of looming economic disaster, menacing migrants, and outrages perpetrated by Democrats against their children, which only he was visionary enough to see and strong enough to combat.\n\nBy late August, I decided to focus my canvassing on Allentown. The city, the third most populous in Pennsylvania, was once an emblem of American steel, but deindustrialization led to its decline, several decades ago. (\"Well, we're living here in Allentown / and they're closing all the factories down,\" Billy Joel sang in 1982.) In recent years, Allentown has undergone an uneven revival spurred by the arrival of tens of thousands of Latinos, many of them exiles from New York, who now make up a majority of the city's population. About half are Puerto Ricans, American citizens who can vote in federal elections if they are registered in the mainland U.S. Another large group are Dominicans, including longtime U.S. citizens and first-generation immigrants. Most of these voters were likely to be registered Democrats or Independents. I speak Spanish, and I concluded that my most effective contribution would be to help run up the vote in Latino neighborhoods in Allentown.\n\nIn a campaign office on Hamilton Street, in the center of the city, I found a corps of young staffers who were smart and vigorous, but perhaps not deeply experienced in the engineering of campaigns, backed up by volunteers who were union members and other stalwart Democrats. In the early days, after Harris's choice of Governor Tim Walz as her running mate and her spectacular performance at the Democratic National Convention , the buzz was like a defibrillator bringing the campaign back from the dead. We were thrilled to think we might be witnessing something akin to the history-making excitement of Barack Obama's first Presidential run, in 2008.\n\nBut what I encountered at the doors in Latino neighborhoods were disaffected people under severe economic stress-workers with little time to watch television and no consistent or reliable channels for political news, who received scattershot information about both Harris and Trump on their mobile phones, and were disgusted by what they perceived as the nasty and pointless name-calling they saw there. I recall the harried look of a Puerto Rican grandmother, one of three registered Democrats in a walk-up apartment crammed with boxes and randomly placed furniture. She was home with her grandchildren, a wailing toddler and a teen-ager, while their parents were juggling day and night shifts at their jobs on a Saturday. She wanted to vote for Harris, she said, if she could get to the polls on Election Day. Often, my conversations started with voters telling me they did not plan to vote because they did not see any point in it.\n\nOn September 7th, I attended a rally, organized by Latinos con Harris and headlined by her husband, Doug Emhoff, in the gym of a local high school. A d.j. from La Mega, the local Spanish-language contemporary radio station, played thumping dance tunes. The crowd cheered boisterously. Even so, the underlying distress was startling: two voters I chatted with ended up in tears. A woman named Julie, who had a disability caused by a car accident and who was living on a fixed income, said she hoped Harris would do something to increase the value of food stamps, because she was not getting enough to eat. A young Dominican mother, Melvis, carrying her infant daughter, said she saw Harris as both an example and protector for the little girl's future. She said she deeply feared that Trump, a court-confirmed sexual predator, would only encourage the rampant, unseen sexual abuse and violence against women in her community.\n\nMeanwhile, I sensed that Harris was struggling to break through. She had an immense hurdle to overcome: the void of communication from the White House about what, if anything, the Biden Administration had done for Allentown and the larger Lehigh Valley. Voters associated Biden with higher prices for basic needs and virtually nothing else. They seemed to think that Trump's term had ended with the stable economy of 2019, rather than with the pandemic and the steep economic downturn that followed. With six weeks to go, Harris's identity as the daughter of a working immigrant mother and her proposals for an \"opportunity economy\" were barely beginning to resonate. In all my weeks of canvassing, only one voter, a Black Latina I met by chance in the parking lot of a Supremo grocery store, raised the issue of women's reproductive rights, a centerpiece of Harris's campaign.\n\nI set aside the campaign's talking points and improvised my own. I talked about what I remembered from 2020, when friends were dying of COVID -19, millions of Americans lost their jobs, and Trump suggested we inject bleach into our bodies. (I found the bleach anecdote invariably sparked vivid memories for voters.) I made a point of saying that Joe Biden was not on the ballot. I created cards with bullet points on Harris's child tax credit and other family-friendly proposals, which even I had a hard time understanding and explaining. I shared a video by the salsa star Marc Anthony, who said with grim intensity that he had not forgotten when Trump blocked funds for Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. I described the terrible harms of family separation that immigrants would face from Trump's mass deportations. I connected with more than one Latina mother when I asked whether Trump, with his lying and philandering, was the example she wanted for her children.\n\nAt times, our tools seemed excessively intrusive. In addition to the door-knocking, voters were bombarded with phone-bank calls and text messages. On my turf lists, most of the voters were not home, and I would leave flyers for the Democratic candidates tucked in their doors. I wondered if they felt uncomfortable that a stranger, presuming to know their political inclinations, had been lurking at their front steps. There were times, too, when I questioned the campaign's tactics. At one point, I was told that paid canvassers had been hired to fan out across Allentown's Latino neighborhoods. Fired-up volunteers (including me) were prohibited from door-knocking there. A major issue seemed to be the information flow, which moved entirely in one direction: from the candidate to the voters. With such an abbreviated campaign, there was little time to collect and respond to the concerns that people were raising at their doors.\n\nNevertheless, by mid-October I noticed a distinct shift. On the weekend of October 19th, thousands of volunteers flocked to the Lehigh Valley, coming from all over the East Coast in convoys of buses and cars, armed with no specific battle plan but determined to answer Michelle Obama's call to \" do something .\" Campaign staffers, pale from exhaustion, deployed these volunteers across the region. Harris and Walz kept up a blitz of rallies. Harris seemed to be growing into her campaign, articulating more specifics on her \"to-do list\" for everyday Americans.\n\nThen came Trump's closing rally, at Madison Square Garden , on October 27th, where the comedian Tony Hinchcliffe committed the epic unforced error of calling Puerto Rico a \"floating island of garbage.\" When I returned to Allentown the following Wednesday, Puerto Rican flags were flying on porches. Residents suddenly realized that Trump's demeaning rhetoric about Haitian and Venezuelan immigrants could extend to them. At one household, where my mobile app told me the family included four registered Democrats, the eldest member saw my Harris-Walz button and shouted to the street, \"Fuck Trump!\" The four had agreed they would go together to cast their votes for Harris on Election Day. On Monday, the last day before the election, Harris finally came to Allentown for a whistle-stop rally. Thousands of people stood in four-hour lines to attend, a more diverse crowd than I had seen at any previous event. The Puerto Rican rapper Fat Joe opened for the Vice-President, exhorting his gente : \"Where's the orgullo ? Where's the pride?\"\n\nAs the vote totals rolled in during the early morning of November 6th, Lehigh County remained a patch of blue in a plain of red that spread across the state of Pennsylvania. We won a fair share of suburban voters and alienated Republicans, and we held off the flight of Latinos to Trump, revealing the fallacy of commentators who had attributed an over-all trend to voters as different as Puerto Ricans and Dominicans in Pennsylvania and Mexican Americans along the border in Texas.\n\nBut for Harris, I now see, it was never really an even fight. Trump commands a movement that he has been fuelling with dark delusions and unapologetic bigotry since he first entered politics, in 2015. Harris was a talented candidate running a modern professional campaign that was just reaching full speed by Election Day. In the middle were millions of voters who merely wanted some relief from the demoralizing strain of life on the economic edge. In all my time in Allentown, I never saw any sign of a Trump ground game like the one the Harris campaign organized. It turned out Trump did not need it.\n\nWhat Democrats needed to win was a movement of their own. Harris seemed to recognize this at the end, when she gave a closing speech at her alma mater, Howard University, saying, \"While I concede this election, I do not concede the fight that fuelled this campaign: the fight for freedom, for opportunity, for fairness, and the dignity of all people.\" In the wake of a sweeping defeat, instead of vivisecting Harris's performance as a candidate or concluding that electing a Black woman to the White House was unrealistic, Democrats should be thinking about how to channel the energies of the supporters who turned out for her, to wage the fight from the ground up.\n\nFrom walking my Allentown turf, I learned that not even the most disciplined campaign could bridge, in one hundred days, the enormous disconnect between Harris and the voters who might benefit from her proposals. Door by door, with the blunt methods of a traditional campaign, canvassers were reëstablishing, very belatedly, a dialogue that had lapsed. After years of reporting on immigrants and the essential optimism of their hope to prosper in the United States, I reject the idea that, to mobilize working people, the Democrats need to imitate Trump's demonization and demagoguery. But building a movement will require better systems for communicating with potential voters and listening, anew, to what they need to make their lives easier.\n\nI have been thinking of the last voter I spoke to in Allentown on Election Day. Charles is a Black man and a Democrat who worked for most of his life as a tile layer. I had met him a few weeks earlier, while canvassing. He suffers from debilitating arthritis and, when I knocked, he had limped to the door with a cane and a pillow under a sore arm. He told me he needed home health care, affordable medications, and confidence that his social-security benefits would sustain him. I followed up with him, because he had told me he needed a ride to the polls. I picked him up in my car. At one point, while waiting in line, he bent over and began to weep in pain, but he was determined to cast a vote for Harris as the first woman President. I'm sorry he did not see her win, but I'll be keeping his tenacity in mind. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "The Tight-Knit World of Kamala Harris's Sorority\n\nThe advice flying around the last night of the Democratic National Convention this past August, at Chicago's United Center, was to not leave your seat after 9 P.M. All day, social media and the convention hall had been abuzz with rumors that the night would end with a performance by Beyoncé. Or maybe Taylor Swift. Or maybe, in a show of interracial solidarity the world had never seen before, they would perform together. Although the superstars never materialized, the crowd was still electric as it waited for the true headliner of the night: Vice-President Kamala Harris, who would be accepting the Democratic Presidential nomination. An hour before Harris appeared, the comedian D. L. Hughley took the stage and addressed what was perhaps the most enthusiastic demographic in the arena: members of Harris's sorority, Alpha Kappa Alpha. \"Where those A.K.A.s at?\" he said, and nodded as the room filled with cheers. \"In three months, ain't gon' be no living with y'all.\"\n\nIf Harris wins the election, she will not only be the first female President; she'll also be the first member of A.K.A. to reach the Oval Office. Since its inception, in 1908, A.K.A., a historically Black sorority, has never endorsed a political party or a candidate-as a nonprofit organization, it isn't allowed to. The sorority's leadership had strongly discouraged the display of A.K.A. insignia at the D.N.C. There would be no pearl-encrusted ivy-leaf pins, no pavé brooches spelling out the organization's founding year.\n\nAnd yet floating among the Convention's fifty thousand attendees, like lily pads across a pond, were hundreds of Black women dressed in the sorority's colors: vibrant greens and various shades of pink-hot, rose, pastel. (The organization's official hue is \"salmon pink,\" but it doesn't specify the temperature of the fish.) I spotted someone in a pink-and-green patterned dress descending the grand staircase of the United Center, as if for a prom picture. Several women wearing fuchsia flats and dyed-green denim stood in line for chicken tenders. One woman toted a pink bag with green letters that spelled out \" Thank You for Shopping Here .\"\n\nThirty of the Jewels of Iridescent Splendor-as the A.K.A.s who were initiated with Harris at Howard University are called-had travelled to Chicago from places like California, Texas, and Tennessee, taking time off from their jobs as lawyers, nurses, accountants, and teachers. They wore white, in honor of the suffragettes, with nods to their group: a magenta blouse, a string of pearls. The corporate securities lawyer Jill Louis watched her line sister's speech-\"On behalf of everyone whose story could only be written in the greatest nation on earth, I accept your nomination to be the President of the United States of America,\" Harris beamed to the crowd from the Convention stage-and told me later that she recognized Harris's discipline, fortitude, and resilience from their time in Alpha Kappa Alpha. \"That strength doesn't have to be iron,\" Louis said. \"It is an elegant strength.\" She pointed to the symbols of the sorority: the hardy ivy plant that can survive in many climates, the beautiful pearl that is wrought through agitation. \"Being able to move forward through adversity is built into the fabric of Alpha Kappa Alpha,\" she told me.\n\nThat training has been remarkably effective. A.K.A. members are a Who's Who of political, cultural, and business luminaries. Minnijean Brown-Trickey, one of the Little Rock Nine, and Bernice King, a daughter of Martin Luther King, Jr., both pledged A.K.A. Toni Morrison was an A.K.A., as is the poet Sonia Sanchez. Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, before she became the first female President elected in Africa, joined A.K.A. It is the most represented sorority in Congress today. The first Black woman to go to space, the first W.N.B.A. player to score more than a thousand points, the first Black female mayor of a major American city, the first Black women to lead the Treasury and Energy Departments, the first Black woman to win a Grand Slam-and now the first Black woman to become a major party's Presidential candidate-are all A.K.A.s. \"The first Black woman to fill-in-the-blank is almost always a sorority woman,\" Dana A. Williams, an A.K.A. and a dean at Howard, told me. \"It's incredibly hard to achieve the first without the sorority backing, because of the networking and bravado.\"\n\nAt the D.N.C., I met Jolanda Jones, an A.K.A. who is a Texas state representative, a former \"Survivor\" contestant, and a onetime star of \"Sisters in Law,\" a reality show about Black female lawyers. She was holding court near a concession stand, hugging people and saving their numbers in her phone. When I asked her why she had joined A.K.A., she looked at me as if I had asked her whether to season meat before cooking it. \"Because it's the best,\" she said. \"I mean, is there even a question?\" She'd already booked her flight and hotel for the Inauguration. (\"I'm wearing pink and green. I'm having custom shit made. I ain't gonna be dressed like nobody else.\") Jones told me that she was at the Convention to witness a Black woman on the path to achieving what white women before her never had. \"Black women have been saving America forever,\" she said. \"There was no way I was going to miss the opportunity to be a part of history for a sorority sister.\"\n\nAlpha Kappa Alpha originated at Howard, the nation's premier historically Black university, and was the first Black Greek-letter organization (B.G.L.O.) for women. (Alpha Phi Alpha, the first B.G.L.O. for men, was founded two years before, in 1906.) Today, A.K.A. has about three hundred and sixty thousand members, who belong to more than a thousand chapters across the world. This summer, the nonprofit organization formed a PAC for the first time to allow political donations and later issued a challenge for members to raise $1,908,000 for Harris. (When asked in late September if they'd met that goal, Danette Anthony Reed, the C.E.O. and international president of A.K.A., told me, \"We haven't given out any of those numbers at this particular time.\")\n\nA.K.A. is part of the Divine Nine, an informal name for the council of the largest Black fraternities and sororities. These organizations, which are all full of movers and machers, have become a formidable bloc of support for the Harris-Walz campaign. As the former Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, a member of Delta Sigma Theta, said, \"This is a very powerful coalition, and it's a lane that the Vice-President uniquely owns.\"\n\nAs I wandered around the Convention, I spotted Christina Henderson, an A.K.A. and a Washington, D.C., council member, near a step-and-repeat, where reporters and TikTok influencers were trying to get a sound bite from Stacey Abrams, the former Georgia gubernatorial candidate. Henderson told me that on July 21st she had been at Target buying school supplies when news broke that Joe Biden had withdrawn from the race and endorsed Harris: \"A girlfriend of mine FaceTimed me and she was, like, ' Girl .' And I said, 'Girl?' And that was all.\" Henderson rushed home to attend a Zoom meeting organized by the group Win with Black Women, during which forty-four thousand people-among them politicians, church leaders, celebrities, and civilians-gathered to strategize about the campaign. Henderson had started attending the group's weekly meetings just before the 2020 election, when the Biden-Harris ticket won ninety per cent of Black female voters.\n\n\"Our organization has already had voter-engagement, civic-engagement efforts, so there's no need to build infrastructure or anything different,\" Henderson said. Even before Biden left the race, the sorority had launched Take 4 or More, a campaign to encourage each member to get at least four additional people to vote. The Divine Nine have a history of voter mobilization; Henderson called them \"the original phone tree.\" Like many of the women I spoke to, she was both proud of and protective of Harris, steeling herself for the inevitable vitriol that would greet a Black female candidate. Kyandra Darling, another A.K.A. and a first-time delegate from Florida, told me that the entire campaign felt personal. \"Her being a Black woman and understanding that of course she was expected to face some challenges that we didn't see when Hillary ran,\" she said. \"She's been the first in many of these spaces.\"\n\nIn the following weeks, Donald Trump was dismissive of Harris's sororal affiliations. He complained in September that Harris had missed Benjamin Netanyahu's congressional address for a \"sorority party.\" In fact, she had spoken at the biennial conference of Zeta Phi Beta, another historically Black sorority. More than six thousand people attended the conference, in Indianapolis, and Harris was reportedly interrupted by applause thirty-two times in less than twenty minutes.\n\nHarris was born to an Indian mother and a Jamaican father. After her parents separated, she and her sister, Maya, were raised by their mother, a biomedical researcher. \"She knew her adopted homeland would see Maya and me as black girls, and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud black women,\" Harris writes in her memoir, \"The Truths We Hold.\"\n\nYet this racial pride has rarely found its way into Harris's campaign. In her Convention speech, Harris instead emphasized her upbringing as a middle-class American. It has been her opponent who has been much more likely to discuss her race. Right before the D.N.C., Trump, in an interview at the annual convention of the National Association of Black Journalists, insinuated that Harris had changed her racial identification for political gain, saying that she \"happened to turn Black.\" (In her first major television interview as a candidate, on CNN, Harris batted away a question about his comment: \"Same old tired playbook. Next question, please.\")\n\nAfterward, many of her supporters held up her time at Howard and her long and active affiliation with Alpha Kappa Alpha as proof that she'd always identified as Black. Many people see in her A.K.A. membership not just a signal of Black identity but a familiar kind of Blackness: a down-home, American-grown world of spades, stepping, homecoming games, and cookouts. As the literary historian Deborah Elizabeth Whaley told me, Harris has a \"commitment to Black cultural experience that the larger populace doesn't get. They don't know what it looks like.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nBut her sorority sisters do. \"I love President Obama, and I love Michelle, but neither of them were Greek,\" Jolanda Jones said during our conversation. (Michelle Obama was invited to become an honorary A.K.A., in 2008, and she accepted, on a nonexclusive basis.) \"Black folks about to do more for Kamala than we did for President Obama.\"\n\nAmong other edicts issued by A.K.A. headquarters in recent weeks was one urging members to be cautious when speaking to the press. The day after Harris became the nominee, sorors received an e-mail that read, \"This message serves as a gentle reminder to be vigilant, careful and mindful of how you are involved in the political process.\" Many A.K.A.s at the D.N.C. declined to say anything political beyond emphasizing the importance of voting, or referred me to their press office. Similarly, A.K.A.'s customs and rituals are fiercely guarded by its members. When I called my auntie, who pledged A.K.A. in 1994, to tell her that I was working on a story about her sorority, she told me how proud she was of me. \"But you know I can't tell you anything!\" she said.\n\nHarris, too, has upheld the secrecy surrounding the organization. She declined to be interviewed for this story, and she mentions the sorority only once in her memoir: \"I pledged a sorority, my beloved Alpha Kappa Alpha, founded by nine women at Howard over a century ago.\" In a 2020 interview, she refused to do the sorority greeting, known as \"skee wee,\" for a Black female journalist who was not an A.K.A. \"When you go through the process of becoming one, we can have that conversation,\" Harris said. Skee wee is a high-pitched sound-imagine Mariah Carey after sucking down some helium-and a literal trademark of the sorority: registration No. 5116853 in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.\n\nA few weeks after the D.N.C., two professors at Howard, Jennifer Thomas and Sheryl Johnson, who both attended the university at the same time as Harris, gave me a tour of the campus, in Washington, D.C. (Johnson is a member of Delta Sigma Theta; Thomas pledged A.K.A. the year after Harris and thus felt compelled to refer to her famous soror as \"Most Gracious Lady Kamala Harris,\" as per sorority code.) Before we began, Johnson pulled up an e-mail on her phone and rattled off a disclaimer worthy of a commercial for blood-pressure medication: \"We're speaking in an individual capacity, not as Howard employees.\" Johnson wasn't \"speaking for Delta Sigma Theta, and I'm not speaking for Alpha Kappa Alpha,\" Thomas said. \"And H.U. is nonpartisan, thus no stance on the election.\" Then we set off for the science buildings.\n\nHarris matriculated at Howard in 1982. As a high schooler, she already knew that she wanted to be a lawyer, like her hero Thurgood Marshall, a Howard Law alum. Since then, she has essentially said that every positive character trait of hers that was not shaped by her mother was formed at Howard. In the nineteen-eighties, D.C. was peak Chocolate City: Black people made up sixty to seventy per cent of the population. It was also a golden era for historically Black colleges and universities across the country. Children of the civil-rights movement were entering higher education with strong racial pride and expectations of solidarity. In 1987, Bill Cosby created the \"Cosby Show\" spinoff \"A Different World,\" which followed a Huxtable daughter at a fictional historically Black college. It quickly became one of the top-rated shows on TV, and H.B.C.U. enrollment rates notably increased during its six-year run. In 1988, Spike Lee released \"School Daze,\" a film partly based on his experiences at Morehouse College, another H.B.C.U. But Howard has long been referred to as the Mecca, a place where Black achievement, community, and culture converge. The historian Natalie Hopkinson told me that attending Howard was tantamount to four years of living as a white man: \"Everything is in your image. Your history, your perspective, your lens on the world is all centered.\"\n\nHarris pledged A.K.A. as a senior, in 1986. About three hundred women applied that year, from a student body of roughly ten thousand. Thirty-eight were accepted. Members of Black Greek-letter organizations were particularly well regarded on campus. \"It was almost like being a celebrity,\" Lorri Saddler, a line sister of Harris's and a vice-president at Clark Atlanta University, told me. Saddler's mother was an A.K.A., as are two of her daughters; when her children were younger, Saddler dressed them in shirts that read \" My Mom is an AKA \" across the front and \" My Grandmother Is Too \" on the back.\n\nThomas and Johnson still keep in touch with some of Harris's line sisters, and we compared notes as we walked by the president's house and through the Punchout, a campus café where Harris reportedly liked to hang out with the fraternity brothers of Kappa Alpha Psi. (Sorority women who did so were called Kappa Sweethearts.) Harris has written that the campus felt like \"heaven\" as soon as freshman orientation, and it was easy to see why: Black students of all complexions and nationalities and hair styles milled around us. We stopped in the Yard, the university's main quad, where nine trees painted with Greek letters lined the perimeter. It was early in the semester, and students sat in candy-red lawn chairs; above them, a Pan-African flag and a Pride flag fluttered amid the branches. On Fridays at noon, Thomas and Johnson told me, A.K.A.s and other sorority members would congregate in the Yard. The flagpole was the meeting point for protests; the trees were the party jump-off. Traditionally, B.G.L.O.s don't have their own housing. In recent years, a few of the organizations have installed commemorative statues on campus, but the trees, Thomas told me, were their unofficial \"national monuments.\"\n\nAlpha Kappa Alpha has a mission of \"service to all mankind,\" which must have appealed to the college-age Harris. One can almost hear echoes of her own 2020 Presidential-campaign slogan, \"Kamala Harris for the People.\" Historically, the organization always maintained a civic focus, with bylaws mandating that each chapter member perform \"at least one piece of Christian, social or civic service\" in the community annually. Harris has spoken of Christine Simmons, a longtime family friend, who was initiated into A.K.A. in 1950, also at Howard, and later became president of an alumni chapter. In 1981, Simmons hosted Norma E. Boyd, one of the sorority's founders, who signed a copy of her memoir for Harris. \"That cherished book now sits in my West Wing office at the White House, as a testament to our enduring legacy,\" Harris told a crowd of A.K.A.s at a convention in Dallas this summer. \"A legacy that began a hundred sixteen years ago, when Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated, was founded to create desperately needed social and legal change and to build networks of support for Black college women.\"\n\nBy the early nineteen-hundreds, only about a thousand Black people had graduated from American colleges and universities. Many no doubt had elders who could give them firsthand accounts of slavery. In 1896, Plessy v. Ferguson had codified Jim Crow laws. The N.A.A.C.P. had yet to exist. Unsurprisingly, Black students were barred from joining existing Greek-letter organizations. In 1908, A.K.A.'s founding year, eighty-nine Black people were recorded as lynched. Alpha Kappa Alpha, like Alpha Phi Alpha before it, was forged as an act of self-reliance: inspired by stories of sorority life on other college campuses, Ethel Hedgemon Lyle, a Howard student from St. Louis, recruited classmates to create a group of their own, in the spring of 1907. Using the Greek lettering system was a rejoinder to former Vice-President John C. Calhoun's pronouncement that \"a Negro would never learn to parse a Greek verb or solve a problem in Euclid.\"\n\nFrom the beginning, A.K.A. aimed to prepare its members for success. In \"Disciplining Women: Alpha Kappa Alpha, Black Counterpublics and the Cultural Politics of Black Sororities,\" Whaley details some of the expectations that the organization set forth in \"The Ivy Primer,\" a sorority manual:\n\nThe ideal soror should control excessive and public display of emotion; conceal weakness; multitask; never use excuses for failure to perform in life . . . be law-abiding, resourceful, tactful; exercise sound judgment . . . remain neatly dressed and poised; and be wide-ranging in conversational ability.\n\nIn its first few decades, A.K.A. advocated for anti-lynching legislation, full voting rights, and education for Black children. During the Great Depression, it provided social services through programs such as the Mississippi Health Project, which brought mobile medical clinics to African Americans in rural parts of the state. In 1948, the B.G.L.O.s formed the American Council on Human Rights, which advised the U.S. government on civil-rights legislation. In 1965, A.K.A. was the first organization chosen to establish a federal job-training program for women.\n\nIn 1983, A.K.A. ran a letter-writing campaign to recognize Martin Luther King, Jr.,'s birthday as a federal holiday. The sorority, along with several other civil-rights organizations, sent half a million letters to Congress and collected more than four million petition signatures. Multiple efforts to pass the bill had stalled. But later that year President Ronald Reagan signed the legislation into law, after the bill was reintroduced by Representative Katie Hall, of Indiana-also a member of A.K.A.\n\nGreek organizations have a long history of using hazing rituals to weed out recruits. The process can range from forcing pledges to undergo mild humiliation to requiring more dangerous stunts. B.G.L.O.s also adopted this practice. In 1925, the Hilltop , Howard's student newspaper, reported that prospective B.G.L.O. inductees went around campus singing songs and wearing \"odd attire\" during their initiation. The next year, Thurgood Marshall, a member of Alpha Phi Alpha, was suspended from his H.B.C.U. for hazing recruits, which, as one biographer noted, he recounted with \"glee\" later in his life. One of his favorite pranks was to have pledges compete in a pantless race, with pickles clenched between their buttocks.\n\nIn the fifties and sixties, hazing practices, which by then could include referring to pledges as \"worms\" or forcing them to roll pencils across a floor with their noses, became inconsistent with the ideals of the civil-rights movement. As hazing was outlawed by schools, many organizations moved their pledging activities underground, and incidents of violent or otherwise unsanctioned hazing activities increased. In 1989, an Alpha Phi Alpha pledge at Morehouse College died following a hazing session. (The university temporarily banned the organization.) As reports of these incidents continued to rise, A.K.A. officially changed its process to focus more on knowledge of sorority history. But this didn't stop the problem. In 2002, two women drowned in California during an A.K.A. pledging process. And, in 2017, a woman who had recently been initiated into A.K.A. at Northwestern University died by suicide, after communicating to her big sisters that the hazing process was causing suicidal thoughts. (In 2020, a lawsuit against the national organization related to the suicide was dismissed.)\n\nFor decades, pledges have submitted to the indignities of hazing because the practice was seen as legitimatizing, even beneficial. A 2013 study in the Howard Law Journal , called \"Belief, Truth, and Positive Organizational Deviance,\" found that, although too much hazing has negative outcomes, a moderate amount leads people to feel more positively about their organization, and to become more active participants. \"There's a kind of human need when going into organizations to have some sort of ritualistic symbolism that allows the person who is outside the group to go into the group and feel accepted,\" Lawrence Ross, a member of Alpha Phi Alpha and the author of \"The Divine Nine: The History of African American Fraternities and Sororities,\" told me. \"But it's a fallacy to believe that hazing creates loyalty.\"\n\nChassidy Mayo, a Christian life coach who was initiated in 2014 at Lamar University, officially renounced her A.K.A. membership last year, in part because of the façade of friendship that she says she was expected to maintain: \"You're being forced to have a relationship with the people who are bringing you into the organization after they've mentally or emotionally abused you, and then you're expected to just be B.F.F.s.\" Mayo said that her initiation felt like a \"cult experience.\"\n\nNone of the thirty-odd A.K.A.s I interviewed would discuss hazing or provide details, on or off the record, about what Harris's process might have been like. \"She's been through it,\" Whaley hypothesized. \"They will be difficult on you. They will put you in circumstances in which you have to think quickly on your feet.\" This treatment, Whaley argued, may have helped Harris get through law school, become a district attorney, and run for Senate.\n\nOn February 12, 1986, Harris and thirty-seven other women received letters inviting them to the sorority's pledge ceremony. No one wanted to talk to me about the rituals involved. I finally found what seemed to be an A.K.A. ritual manual, from 1977, on WikiLeaks. It outlined instructions for an elaborate initiation ceremony, during which pledges dressed in black and wore wreaths of ivy. At least according to the manual, they prayed, sang, and took vows to be \"submissive and in every way to subjugate [themselves] to the highest authority\" and to be \"free and clean of heart, and strong to beat the glory to its goal.\" One source familiar with the organization said, \"It looks like someone took aspects and produced an inaccurate document.\" I asked several A.K.A.s, individually, if the document was authentic. In response, I received a group e-mail from five of them declining to verify it, and stating that they no longer wished to participate in this story.\n\nOnce inducted into A.K.A., Harris became known as C 3 : calm, cool, and collected. Much has been written about her time at Howard: her tendency to carry a briefcase around campus and her participation in student protests against apartheid. Many of her line sisters told me that she was unflappable and precise, with a big, hearty laugh. During her freshman year, Harris was recruited for the debate team-the only place her affability didn't follow her. A classmate from that time has said, \"The one thing I can always remember about Kamala is that she was always friendly and the nicest person. But in a debate it was almost like a switch was turned.\" In her first year, her line volunteered at local hospitals and day-care centers, performed at a gospel show for seniors, and fasted to raise money for hunger.\n\nBefore our tour concluded, Thomas and Johnson wanted to show me the campus chapel, which has stained-glass windows that honor the Divine Nine. In the past century, Martin Luther King, Jr., Desmond Tutu, Frederick Douglass, W. E. B. Du Bois, and Mary McLeod Bethune have all spoken there. Every Sunday, Thomas and Johnson told me of their time at Howard, the members of the B.G.L.O.s would attend church together, dressed in black coats and patent-leather shoes. Afterward, they'd \"line up like dominoes,\" Thomas said, and start their greetings. Some forty years later, she still remembered how to greet older members. She straightened her back, stiffened her arms by her sides, and flared her hands, whipping her head back on every \"Alpha\": \"Hello, most gracious ladies of the upper, uppermost house of Alpha chapter, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated, Howard University, Washington, D.C., 20059!\"\n\nAlpha Kappa Alpha was formed in part to cultivate friendship and community among like-minded Black women in college, but nearly everyone I spoke with emphasized the feeling that joining was a lifetime commitment, and that mentorship was key. \"For white folks, Greek life is a club,\" the sociologist Matthew Hughey, an author of the Howard Law Journal article, told me. \"For Black folks, Greek life is a calling.\"\n\nAfter graduating, Harris, too, carried forward A.K.A.'s mission of uplifting other Black women. Venus Johnson, the chief deputy attorney general of California, worked for Harris more than a decade ago, when Harris was the state's attorney general. Johnson told me that a promotion by Harris, who counselled her on professional and personal matters, changed the trajectory of her career. In 2004, Lateefah Simon, now a Bay Area congressional candidate, was hired in her early twenties by Harris, who at the time was the district attorney of San Francisco. Simon said that Harris has mentored her ever since: \"When I see an unknown caller on my phone, I'm, like, 'It's either student loans or Kamala Harris.' \"\n\nSimon's tenure in the D.A.'s office was part employment, part finishing school. She called Harris the toughest boss she's ever had, and told me that she went to college only because Harris \"made\" her enroll. Once she did, Harris kept track of her grades. \"And, let me tell you, I was a grown-ass woman with a child,\" Simon said. (She had also already won a MacArthur Fellowship.) \"But no one was asking of me what Kamala had asked of me, and I found that I needed it and wanted it.\"\n\nBut there is also, Simon insisted, a warmth to Harris. She's the type of boss who calls you on your birthday. When Harris's employees didn't have child care, she encouraged them to bring their kids to work, the way her mother had done with her and her sister. One day, Simon asked Harris a style-related question: Why did she wear pearls all the time? Harris told her that pearls were a reclamation of the way the world disparaged Black women, or saw them as rough. \"I went to Howard University,\" Harris told Simon. \"I'm a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha.\"\n\nIf she wins, Harris would not be the first Greek to occupy the Oval Office. Nineteen former Presidents were fraternity men. Several, including Rutherford B. Hayes, George H. W. Bush, and George W. Bush, were Dekes, or members of Delta Kappa Epsilon, which was founded at Yale in 1844. These days, a quarter of the House and sixty-four per cent of the Senate are members of a Greek-letter organization. Professional success and fraternal affiliation have always had a chicken-and-egg relationship: Do Greek organizations produce leaders, or just attract them? What comes first, the drive or the pledge?\n\nA career in politics no doubt appeals to members of fraternities and sororities, which in many ways are governments unto themselves: for everything in politics, there is a fraternal or sororal equivalent. Greek organizations have regular elections and distinct emblems. A national or international body, governed by alumni, sets the rules. Parsing a bill on the Senate floor or fund-raising for a campaign may come more easily to those who participated in similar activities in college. Caya Lewis Atkins, who pledged A.K.A. at Spelman College in 1992, is now the chief adviser for policy and strategy for the Office of Global Affairs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. She told me that she learned Robert's Rules of Order as an A.K.A., as well as two skills she still uses today: how to make a vegetable plate and how to run a meeting.\n\nEarly fraternities expected their pledges-white, male, Christian, and preferably wealthy-to be among the \"most handsome, athletic, social, and confident\" members of their class, according to a 2010 study on the history of white college fraternities. Though emerging out of segregation, Black Greek-letter organizations, too, had supercilious standards for their members and rules about who could join. Sojourner Jackson, a former president of Zeta Phi Beta, once observed that when she was an undergraduate, in the nineteen-thirties, fraternity and sorority membership demanded that recruits belong to a certain class. \"At that time, if you didn't have the money-if your parents didn't give it to you-you couldn't get into the organization,\" she said. Some recent undergraduate A.K.A.s told me that their initiation fee was between $1,500 and $2,000, an eye-popping amount for which some inductees have to fund-raise.\n\nLink copied\n\nHughey, the sociologist, described B.G.L.O.s as having a \"schizophrenic\" relationship with class. \"These organizations, make no mistake about it, are élitist,\" he said. (Hughey, who is white, is a member of Phi Beta Sigma, a B.G.L.O. \"I grew up in a majority-Black neighborhood in the South, and a lot of my mentors were fraternity men,\" he said.) Yet he pointed out that their social contributions cannot be ignored. He sees them as \"vibrant contributors to Black life, and to the betterment of white America, too.\"\n\nB.G.L.O. members were never expected to assimilate into white culture; rather, it was hoped that they would anticipate and upend negative stereotypes by comporting themselves excellently: maintaining good grades, being active in their communities, advocating for equal rights, and so on. But the organizations' image control could be oppressive to their pledges, and was in some ways reminiscent of the élitist, exclusionary ways of white G.L.O.s. I couldn't help broaching the concept of \"respectability\" in many of my conversations with scholars, the sense that these organizations were training their members this way for the approval of white people. Ross, the author of \"The Divine Nine,\" said that the battle wasn't for acceptance: \"It's about a fight for dignity in terms of the notion of fighting an ideology that says, 'You are, by being Black, completely inferior.' \"\n\nEven though B.G.L.O.s emerged from an effort to engender racial solidarity, they also have a history of reinforcing colorism. Until the nineteen-twenties, according to Whaley's book, eighty per cent of the student population at five H.B.C.U.s reportedly was of a lighter complexion. Even when that began to change, the B.G.L.O.s' preference for fair-skinned members was obvious. As one student wrote in the Hilltop in 1929, \"We find these fraternities and sororities seeking the brotherhood or womanhood of those persons who are of light complexion or who are light brown skinned. Very few are chosen from the third group or darker set.\"\n\nAlpha Kappa Alpha, in particular, has long had a reputation for colorism. In a 2011 study of stereotypes among members of historically Black sororities, published in the Journal of Sorority and Fraternity Life Research and Practice , participants described A.K.A.s as \"classy, rich . . . delicate, pretty, dainty, snobby . . . and light skinned with long hair.\" Many sorors I spoke with over the phone told me their skin color, unprompted, as if to dispel A.K.A.'s reputation. \"Oh, I didn't know Kamala was an A.K.A.,\" my sister said, after I told her about this story. \"But I'm not surprised. She looks like one.\"\n\n\"I call all that urban legend,\" Danette Anthony Reed, the organization's C.E.O., said. \"A.K.A. right now is all shades.\"\n\nBrea Baker, who was initiated into A.K.A.'s New Haven chapter as a Yale student in 2016, acknowledged that, as a fair-skinned Black woman, she perpetuates the stereotype. Measures like insuring that a soror's skin color is no darker than a paper bag may have fallen out of fashion, but more insidious forms of prejudice persist. Baker recounted that long, flowing hair has been integral to an A.K.A.'s presentation. \"Alpha Kappa Alpha has stepped up and done some really amazing things, sociopolitically, for the Black community,\" she said. \"But if we only make space in those rooms for Black people who look just like us, then that's not as liberatory as we might think.\"\n\nOne way that A.K.A. encourages a lifelong commitment is by increasing the likelihood that its members are accepted into the Links, an invitation-only service organization centered on prominent Black women, and Jack and Jill, a cultural and social club for African American children. (Harris is an honorary member of the Links.) These organizations all put a high value on professional success, and view community service as both a form of outreach and a sign of conformity to a middle-class ideal. When Glenda Glover, a former president of A.K.A., told me that the Harris campaign and the organization shared a mission, I was not expecting her to talk about the effort to increase Black female representation on corporate boards and in the C-suite. \"We're putting people in positions of power so you can influence others,\" she said. She saw this mission in terms of destiny. \"That's the ultimate, to become President of the United States,\" she said. \"That shows how far God has brought us as a people, and how far Black women have come.\"\n\nEven before I grew up to be a dreadlocked, braless lesbian with tattoos and hairy armpits, I was always suspicious of sororities. Secrets and group activities make me uneasy. I am the eldest of five daughters, and I never want to wear a matching outfit again. The A.K.A.s I interviewed for this story frustrated me-in part because, aside from their Fort Knox levels of secrecy, so many of them were encouraging to an almost absurd degree. They were so happy to hear that I was writing for a magazine. They were so happy to see that I was Black. Four women told me that they were praying for me and my article. After my afternoon at Howard, Johnson sent me a thank-you card for the tour that she gave me .\n\nI could see how Harris might continue to derive fortitude from her relationships with these women. Throughout the years, her line sisters have stayed close, and they look out for one another. Jill Louis, the lawyer, told me that, when she and a line sister were undergoing cancer treatment at the same time, the other women came to care for them. \"I have a lovely, stable home and family, but there was something about having that line sister who came to make sure that I was well and that my husband was well that first week,\" Louis said. The bonds and the level of organization go back to their college days. When the women were on campus, they were \"a well-oiled machine,\" Lorri Saddler told me. \"We all fell into our roles and contributed based on who we are.\"\n\nThey've taken that model to their campaign work. Debbie-Anne Reese, who was elected as the president of Harris's line more than forty years ago, organized everyone into various committees. Kuae Noel Kelch reviews all media requests for the line. Saddler is comfortable being more public-facing, so she handles many of the interviews. Nine women on the line are lawyers, so they weigh in on protocol and legalities. I asked Louis-who has a background in nonprofit governance-how they managed to do all of this without running up against partisanship. \"That's not a problem for us,\" she said. \"That's what we learn in the sorority, how to be disciplined.\"\n\nAll of A.K.A.'s fund-raising efforts are directed by the PAC . A source shared an official e-mail, sent to members in mid-October, that reported that the PAC had raised $460,000 for Harris and $450,000 for congressional races. On the ground, A.K.A. is focussed on getting out the vote. An unofficial A.K.A. group chat called Pearls for Kamala, which more than eight thousand sorors have joined, allows members to sign up for action items like designing merchandise and registering voters. On social media, various chapters have posted Election Day checklists (I.D., water, \"good attitude\") and state-specific rules on absentee voting. A.K.A.'s initiatives have changed since the civil-rights movement, but in some ways the national landscape hasn't. As Whaley put it, \"They're not at diners trying to desegregate things, but there's a resurgence of a kind of Jim Crow, trying to disenfranchise people.\" Recent voter-registration drives have been held in areas with sizable Black populations: New Haven, Chattanooga, Cleveland, Chicago, Savannah. As one eightysomething A.K.A. told me, \"Anytime we're doing anything, we're going to be registering voters.\"\n\nWill efforts like this by A.K.A. and the rest of the Divine Nine make a difference in the election? Aisha Mills, a public-affairs strategist and social-impact adviser, thinks they could. \"It's the marshalling of bodies that makes it such a powerful organizing and mobilizing bloc,\" she said. \"If you contrast that with the Republicans, they have evangelicals, they've got AIPAC , but they're not on college campuses.\" She noted, \"Democratic victory is predicated on Black communities.\"\n\nOn a balmy Sunday afternoon in September, I went to a voter-registration drive in Manhattan, held by Fordham University and the Pi Kappa Omega chapter of A.K.A. The attendees, who were mostly women in their fifties and sixties, stood around a cookie-and-coffee station in their church clothes. The turnout was only decent at first, despite a scheduled appearance by the actor Courtney B. Vance. Someone whispered that the Abyssinian Baptist Church, the influential church in Harlem, was having a community-outreach event at the same time.\n\nUndaunted, three sorors-accessorized in pink and green, naturally-sat behind a long wooden table. They asked anyone who came within listening distance if they were registered to vote. Fun-size candy bars littered the table. One soror tallied how many people the women had spoken to (twenty-five) versus how many voter-registration forms they'd handed out (four). Lisa White-Tingling and Jasmine McFarlane-White, a mother-and-daughter pair, introduced me to everyone there. White-Tingling, the chair of the chapter's social-action committee, had registration forms in English, Spanish, and Korean. She told me that her chapter had been getting all kinds of people to vote: high-school students, senior citizens, people in transitional housing. Like everyone else I interviewed, mother and daughter emphasized their nonpartisan status, going so far as to point out that they were each wearing something blue and something red. (They also both wore pearls and Converse tennis shoes, just as Harris did on the February, 2021, cover of Vogue .)\n\nDuring the next hour, the sorors high-fived registered voters and tried to avoid the temptation of the cookies. A few people came by to thank them for their service; one woman bragged that she'd been voting \"since Jimmy Carter.\" When Courtney B. Vance arrived, everyone jumped up for an impromptu photo shoot. One woman, Yunice Emir, handed me her phone and asked if I could take pictures. We began talking, and eventually traded numbers. Later, I received a text from her: \"So incredible meeting you brilliant queen!\" She thought we should go to lunch. ♦\n\nAn earlier version of this story failed to include Caya Lewis Atkins's full name.\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

The Vice-President has never been entirely comfortable with the interview format. \"She doesn't ruminate and reflect,\" the staff writer Evan Osnos says. \"I think it's the self-protection that comes with being aware of people who are always going to doubt her capacity to make history.\" Osnos's deeply reported profile of Vice-President Kamala Harris, \" Kamala Harris's Hundred-Day Campaign ,\" has just been published.

      "text": "Will Kamala Harris Win the Kamala Harris Vote?\n\nResidents of New Hampshire, where Presidential hopefuls often court diners at greasy spoons, have come to expect high-level politico drop-ins. Not long ago, a doctor's office in Portsmouth prepared itself for a visit from the Vice-President. A half-dozen staffers stood at attention in the waiting room, ready for duties both Hippocratic and patriotic. A white woman with blond hair who was several months pregnant entered and checked in with the receptionist: she, Kamala Harris, was there for her scheduled appointment. The letdown was palpable. The patient rolled her eyes. \"I was, like, 'Why would the Vice-President go to a doctor in Portsmouth ?' \" Harris, a thirty-two-year-old resident of nearby Seabrook, said recently. Generally, she goes by Kamii.\n\nSome Presidents have plenty of name duplicates. There are more than a hundred George Bushes in New York alone; IMDb has listings for almost a hundred James, Jimmy, or Jim Carters. A few even achieve a prominence of their own. In the early sixties, the Washington Senators had a third baseman named John Kennedy, who also shared a birthday with the then President. The Virginia oncologist Donald L. Trump has inspired a rare bit of humility from the forty-fifth President, who once said that the doctor is \"probably more important than Donald J. Trump, which is me.\"\n\nIf measuring Presidential-name popularity on a scale of Barack Obama to Andrew Johnson, Kamala Harris would fall somewhere around Martin Van Buren: others exist, but they're rare. Public-records searches suggest that you could count them on your fingers. Some, like their political namesake, seem to be reticent with the press. Others might reply to an inquiring text with \"I am not the vice president.\" Their name is one part common (Harris is the twenty-fifth most popular surname in the U.S.), one part less so (Kamala is five thousand one hundred and thirtieth among given names, according to MyNameStats.com). The forty-nine-year-old Kamala Harris of San Bernardino, California, made it four decades without encountering anyone with even her first name, let alone her first and last. Recently, she, too, visited a new doctor and was met with disbelief. \"I showed my driver's license,\" she said. She was named Kamala, in the seventies, after a similar-sounding form of funk dancing that her father liked. This past summer, people would jokingly ask who she was going to pick as her running mate.\n\n\"It gets annoying quick,\" Kamii said. She has become accustomed to the routine when she presents I.D. at her local dispensary: \"It's, like, a whole five-minute thing of 'That's so crazy, what are the odds?' You have to just be polite and entertain it, you know?\" Growing up was worse. Kids twisted her first name into vulgarities.\n\nThe Vice-President, as her grandnieces memorably demonstrated at the D.N.C., pronounces her first name like \"comma-la,\" with emphasis on the first syllable: KAH-muh-luh. Trump and his partisans have continually deployed it as \"Kuh-MAH-la.\" Perhaps they just can't shake the preferred pronunciations of Kamala Khan, a Marvel superheroine who débuted in 2013, and Kamala the Ugandan Giant, a late pro wrestler who occasionally took on Trump's pal Hulk Hogan. (That Kamala's real name: James Harris.) More likely, it's a disrespectful dig, with a subtext of othering. \"I don't think that's right,\" the San Bernardino Kamala Harris said, of such willful mispronunciations. But, if you called her KAH-muh-luh, that wouldn't be quite right, either: she pronounces it like Pamela. So does Kamii in New Hampshire.\n\nKamala Plaisted, of Weston, Connecticut, does, too. She's part of another select club: the former Kamala Harrises. Like Kamala DeLuz, of Sacramento (who goes by Denise, her middle name), Plaisted dropped Harris, her maiden name, when she got married, twenty years ago. Plaisted, who is of mixed European stock, was named in honor of the Indian-born actress Kamala Devi, whose husband, Chuck Connors, Plaisted's mother adored. (Devi is also the Vice-President's middle name.) She is pretty sure that she was once confused with the Veep, in the mid-nineties, when she gave her name to a clerk at Saks Fifth Avenue, who then called up an account with a San Francisco address. \"The lovely girl was, like, 'Oh, my gosh, there's two of you!' \" Plaisted recalled. Her name change has failed to insulate her from being bothered by impassioned non-constituents on the phone. \"Some have been threatening,\" she said. \"And a couple have been, like, 'Oh, please, you're the only one that can help us! I know who you are!' And I'm, like, 'I'm not.' \"\n\nMixups can have their benefits. Every once in a while, the New Hampshire Kamala Harris reported, she receives an unsolicited PayPal deposit from a mistaken would-be donor. It's typically five or ten bucks, which has been a help to her as a single mother of three. \"That side of it has been pretty cool,\" she said. She doesn't correct them. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?
