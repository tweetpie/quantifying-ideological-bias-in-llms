      "text": "'Gotta be kidding': Jim Jordan scrambles as he's confronted over Musk 'double standard'\n\nU.S. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) listens to House Oversight Committee Ranking Member Rep. James Comer (R-KY) during a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing on \"The Urgent Need to Address the Gun Violence Epidemic,\" on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., June 8, 2022.\n\nWASHINGTON - What emails?\n\nThat's the mood from congressional Republicans these days as allegations of private servers and accessing sensitive, private data swirl about this White House.\n\nIn 2016 alone, House Republicans issued more than 70 subpoenas or investigative inquiries into Hillary Clinton and her private server.\n\nMany of those same Republicans are now shrugging off fears that Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency - a.k.a. DOGE - are flouting government protocols while scouring government databases in their effort to purge federal workers.\n\nBut Republicans are about to have a reckoning. Last summer the Supreme Court gave this Congress homework - work policymakers on Capitol Hill haven't had to do in the past 40 or so years: Write precise rules and regulations instead of leaning on experts in federal agencies to flesh out the policy specifics after Congress passes a bill.\n\nIt's unclear if the contemporary Congress is up to the serious task of policymaking, especially the 119th Congress, which is brimming with technophiles focused on clicks, viral videos and digital dunking.\n\nIn the month since Trump took his oath of office, critics say, instead of standing up for Congress and flexing the new powers the Supreme Court bestowed on the institution, congressional Republicans have all but surrendered their oversight responsibilities as they've ceded unprecedented power to President Donald Trump and his billionaire sidekick, Elon Musk.\n\nAll this talk of a 'constitutional crisis' may be a tad premature. What's certain is America's in the midst of a congressional crisis - one the current Congress may not be able to withstand.\n\nIn more than a dozen exclusive interviews, Republicans on Capitol Hill tell Raw Story not to rule Congress out yet, even as critics fear there's not going to be much power left for legislators to reclaim with the GOP ceding so much legislative turf to Trump and DOGE at the start of this new administration.\n\n\"I'm delighted\"\n\nSeveral Republicans who spoke to Raw Story are cheering for Musk and Trump to dismantle the very federal government set up by Congress in recent years and decades.\n\n\"Do you worry that you guys are ceding a little too much power?\" Raw Story asked Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) while walking through the Capitol.\n\n\"Well, I hate to say this, but the only way it's going to happen, in my opinion, is if we let them do it the way they're doing it. Otherwise, it won't get done. So I'm delighted,\" Lummis - who was a member of the far-right, Constitution-wagging Freedom Caucus when she served in the House - told Raw Story. \"I mean, really, really delighted with the way that Trump is allowing the DOGE people to audit.\"\n\nTeam Trump is set on upending, dismantling, overhauling or outright deleting government websites, grants, programs, agencies, protocols and even federal employees themselves.\n\nThe courts are now dealing with an onslaught of legal challenges to this new MAGA administration. All those cases will take time to wind through the judiciary, but the Supreme Court's already spoken.\n\nLast June, the Supreme Court issued new, norm-upending marching orders to Congress when, in a 6-3 ruling, the majority of justices overturned a pivotal, if wonky, 1984 decision when the Roberts Court obliterated the so-called Chevron doctrine, which enabled experts in federal agencies to write rules and regulations never explicitly spelled out by Congress.\n\nThat means, Congress' crutch is gone. It remains unclear if lawmakers will be able to stand on their own and master the jot and tittle of measures they send to the president's desk.\n\nBut for now, at least, Republican majorities on Capitol Hill seem fine outsourcing the legislative branch's powers to Trump and his White House.\n\n\"We're witnessing the collapse of a lot of constitutional boundaries\"\n\nIn spite of claiming otherwise, DOGE and its unelected leader, Elon Musk, are so opaque, it's unclear just how their tech is set up. But IT experts say they seem to be operating their own, non-governmental server.\n\nWhile a case winds through federal courts, Republicans on Capitol Hill are fine with giving Musk, basically, whatever he wants.\n\n\"Like, with Musk, I was playing back the tape, you guys were really hard on Hillary for her server,\" Raw Story recently pressed House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan (R-OH). \"Is there a double standard here?\"\n\n\"No, not a double standard. I mean, Hillary Clinton as secretary of state, after the policy decisions that administration made led to - and security decisions that the administration made - led to the deaths of Americans in Benghazi, Libya,\" Jordan - the second most senior Republican on the Oversight Committee - told Raw Story. \"And then we find out 60,000 emails, and she destroyed, like, 30,000 of them. You gotta be kidding me.\"\n\n\"So just having the server isn't the problem?\" Raw Story pressed.\n\n\"Right. Musk isn't destroying anything,\" Jordan said. \"He just wants to know where your money's being spent.\"\n\nDemocrats agree on one point. They say there's literally no comparing 'her emails' to the work Musk's conducting in secret.\n\n\"No, the two are not comparable, in that Elon is in a class by himself. It's not just the server, but the unfettered power that Trump's given him,\" Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-TX) told Raw Story. \"But I think it's important in talking about him to remember, everything he does is empowered by Trump. Good cop, bad cop.\"\n\nTo congressional Republicans, Trump and Musk are both playing good cop.\n\n\"I'm amazed,\" Jordan said. \"The Trump administration is up to the most intense and focused start of any administration, certainly in my lifetime. I think the American people appreciate the focused, intense, on-offense type of start to this administration.\"\n\n\"Are you afraid that Congress could be ceding a little bit of its authority - too much of its authority - to the White House and an unelected official?\" Raw Story asked.\n\n\"No. I think you have this focused effort by DOGE to identify stupid things that the federal government's spending money on,\" Jordan said. \"And I think when the American people see that, they're like, 'Well, that's ridiculous. Of course, we need to change that.'\"\n\nDemocrats aren't surprised by much these days. Still, many are astounded watching GOP leaders on Capitol Hill outsource their legislative responsibilities to officials across the Trump administration set on canceling decade's worth of congressional work - from bipartisan foreign aid programs to nonpartisan domestic food assistance programs.\n\n\"There's a shameful abdication of legislative power and responsibility by the GOP majority to the executive branch and the executive branch's lawless delegate,\" Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) - a constitutional scholar by trade - told Raw Story. \"We're seeing tremendous erosion of our constitutional edifice.\"\n\nRaskin finds the blurred lines between Musk's work at DOGE and the billions of dollars in federal contracts his companies, like SpaceX, receive beyond troubling.\n\n\"We're witnessing the collapse of a lot of constitutional boundaries,\" Raskin - the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee - said. \"You know, we have this extraordinary convergence of governmental power with corporate power to the extent that a major federal contractor collecting billions from the taxpayers is now also a federal government employee purporting to oversee federal spending.\"\n\nUnlike Trump's first administration, today's Trump-centric GOP is unified at the Capitol, at least when it comes to oversight, which Raskin says isn't taking place in spite of Republican rhetoric claiming otherwise.\n\n\"They keep talking about, you know, what a great job Elon Musk is doing on oversight when we have an Oversight Committee. The Judiciary Committee has an oversight subcommittee. All of Congress is supposed to be doing oversight as a central part of our responsibility,\" Raskin said. \"And so instead, they want one, you know, unvetted government contractor to be doing oversight over federal contracts. It's ridiculous.\"\n\nIt's not just the lack of oversight. Republicans on Capitol Hill are now Musk's biggest cheerleaders.\n\n\"Everybody sorta ran on the same stuff\"\n\nRepublicans refute claims they're laying down on the job. Instead, they argue today's GOP is in lockstep with the Trump White House.\n\n\"What do you view as your guy's role in this Congress?\" Raw Story asked Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ). \"Is it oversight of the executive, or is it working in tandem because you all are so aligned?\"\n\n\"I don't know of anybody here who ran away from the president in their campaign. You know what I mean?\" the former Freedom Caucus chair told Raw Story. \"So everybody sorta ran on the same stuff that included reducing spending, continuing tax cuts, planning for security, that inflation would be dealt with by reducing spending - you know, the whole thing.\"\n\nSo, instead of passing new measures to bolster the Trump administration's prerogatives, Republicans are sitting back and enjoying the rowdy show just down Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\n\"We're going to do those mandates. We view it as a voter mandate, which gives us a mandate,\" Biggs said. \"So we move, we work together.\"\n\nBesides made-for-TV flurries of executive action from Trump and Musk, there's not that much working together going on. As each day passes, the threat of a government shutdown increases ahead of the current funding deadline, March 14.\n\nInstead of conducting formal oversight on the administration - like the GOP conducted at the end of the Obama administration and throughout the Biden administration - many Republicans now say their job is to oversee taxpayer dollars. Thus, Republicans say they're in lockstep with Trump, Musk and DOGE.\n\n\"The oversight role still continues, though,\" Biggs said. \"It's not a new idea to have an independent third party, you know, looking into something like this, so our oversight is to make sure that we know where the dollars are going, just like we've been trying to do for the last - ever since I got here.\"\n\n\"Now Democrats, they say you guys are just puppets for Musk and Trump,\" Raw Story pressed. \"You all see it differently?\"\n\n\"No, that's not true,\" Biggs said. \"That's kind of a talking point narrative that they're trying to build on, because they don't have jack squat on policy.\"\n\nRepublicans remain light on policy themselves. That's despite the new Supreme Court mandate - when it struck down the ' Chevron doctrine' last summer - that Congress get serious about writing legislation instead of leaning on federal agencies to think for Congress.\n\nDon't tell DOGE...\n\nThe day's quickly approaching when Trump will run out of executive orders to sign, and he'll need Congress to send him actual bills to sign into law.\n\nLawmakers are braced. Their jobs - or, at the very least, those of their staff - have already gotten noticeably harder since Chief Justice Roberts and the court's conservatives upended the precedent set in the 1984 Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council decision.\n\n\"I haven't thought of it that way. I do think it's put an extra burden on us,\" Sen. Lummis - the Wyoming Republican who used to be on the Freedom Caucus - said. \"It ramps up our drafting. We're more detailed about our drafting because Chevron .\"\n\nIt's not just making drafting legislation more meticulous: it seems to be melding lawmakers from the president's own party with the very federal agencies lawmakers are supposed to oversee.\n\n\"Just more hard work. And it is all specifically geared towards Chevron , but I can't really say that it has affected the relationship between the legislative and executive branch, yet,\" Lummis said. \"It might, but more the agency level than the White House level. You know, the agencies we work with.\"\n\nBut soon, the agencies won't be much assistance as this Congress will be required to stand on its own.\n\n\"The Supreme Court said, 'Hey, you guys gotta do your job,'\" Raw Story reminded Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX).\n\n\"I think we're early in trying to figure out how to mechanically put all that in place,\" Roy told Raw Story at the Capitol. \"Like, I think, honestly, a lot of what DOGE is doing and what Elon's doing, we've got to embrace and put in our own orbit in Congress.\"\n\nWhile Musk, Trump and many rank-and-file Republicans are promising some $2 trillion in federal budget cuts, Roy and a handful of other Republicans argue increased funding is needed now to save money in the long run.\n\nRoy argues efforts to cut Congress' own budget - legislative branch appropriations, to be precise - are misguided, because expertise is needed to upend the administrative state legislatively.\n\n\"Guys that are always wanting to slash and burn [legislative] branch approps, I'm like, 'You got to have your own,'\" Roy said. \"You've got to understand in a post- Chevron world, we got to be able to do our jobs. We need to have, certainly, in some organized fashion - I'm not sure every office has to be beefed up - but our ability to be able to have overview and constraint.\"\n\nRoy says that's where Republicans are rooting for Musk most.\n\nInstead of the time it takes to investigate and then issue a formal report or to \"have somebody come testify,\" Roy believes the technology-driven Silicon Valley approach will leave a lasting imprint on on not just the executive branch but Congress itself.\n\n\"Look, with technology now, I mean, what Elon's showing - whether you love him or you don't - the ability to use algorithms and computers and AI to go pore over the government and expose all of the horse crap that we've all been seeing, that we have observed,\" Roy said.\n\n\"Democrats say you guys are puppets of Musk and Trump,\" Raw Story pressed. \"But you guys don't see it that way?\"\n\n\"No - at all, actually,\" Roy said. \"So far, what I've seen is the president empowering an individual to root through the crap and expose it...and I think this will now empower Congress in the future - both sides of the aisle - to be able to go forward and pore over all of this crap.\"\n\n\"Because, essentially, when you do spending bills, you'll fill in some of the things that they're currently doing?\" Raw Story asked.\n\n\"Correct,\" Roy said. \"But we're going to need to be able to use those same tools and have input and/or build out our own.\"\n\nThe steady stream of complaints flowing from the left is mere white noise to congressional Republicans these days.\n\n\"I think the hyperbole coming from the Democrats is simply because they lost and all of their little pet programs that they've loved for years are going away,\" Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) told Raw Story. \"That is fear-mongering. The same fear-mongering that had them ignore the reality of the southern border, and it is why they lost, not just the Senate, That's why they lost the White House.\"\n\nRepublicans may have won in November, but Democrats say they're already squandering their newfound populist appeal at the feet of unelected billionaires, like when Musk backed a government shutdown during Congress' last funding fight in December.\n\n\"They have a chance to succeed on, like, big issues that they ran on, but if they're gonna do this nonsense, it'll all fall down on them,\" Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) told Raw Story earlier this winter after Democrats came to Republicans' rescue and funded the government.\n\nPOT HED: MAGA Effect: \"It's a different party, in so many ways\"\n\nThe MAGA-mandate may be nebulous, but to card-carrying club members, part of their job is to dismantle American conservatism - or what became of it in recent neocon saturated decades - itself.\n\n\"Is part of the mandate also to upend the Republican Party of old?\" Raw Story asked the House Judiciary chair.\n\n\"It just happens. It's a different party in so many ways,\" Jordan told Raw Story. \"Someone said this a few years ago, you know, 'We're no longer the wine and cheese party. We're a beer and blue jeans party.' And so we're much more, I think, a working-class, middle-class-focused party.\"\n\n\"I always say, we make the job too complicated. Job's pretty simple. We just tell the voters what you were gonna do when you ran for it. If you get elected, go do what you said. President Trump does that better than anyone,\" Jordan said. \"But when you have someone whose, like, singular purpose and focus is to identify that and say, 'We need to stop this' - that's a good thing.\"\n\nDemocrats are still regrouping after their party's stunning defeat in November, but they see one sliver of an opening - one many predict will only grow in the coming months - as they watch this, supposedly, populist president pal around with billionaires.\n\n\"He's good at taking care of people who can afford to join Mar-a-Lago, so that's, like, his crowd, whether it be a tax bill or whether it be for who he's bringing in the administration,\" Rep. Mark Pocan (D-WI) told Raw Story. \"It's just very different than what we've been used to, where you bring in experts in areas. Instead, he just brings in fellow rich people.\"\n\nNOW READ: Be horror-stricken Trump used the same Bonaparte quote as a right-wing mass muderer"

In his letter to the company, Jordan wrote that Bragg 'hired the third highest-ranking Department of Justice official to assist in his partisan prosecution of President Trump,' alluding to the fact that Bragg brought a prosecutor onboard to help develop the criminal case against Trump, which ended with a trial in which jurors concluded the former president committed 34 felonies.\n\nThe Beast reports Bragg's office said in a statement this week, \"The office stands by any efforts made to encourage companies to act responsibly and prevent children from accessing tutorials to manufacture dangerous guns that can be used in violent crimes.\"\n\nThe Daily Beast's full report is available here (subscription required)."

      "text": "The disaster that is Jim Jordan\n\nToday, House Republicans nominated Jim Jordan to be the next speaker. But Jordan doesn't yet have the 217 votes he needs to win - and may not be able to assemble them.\n\nIf elected speaker, Jordan would effectively give the House to Donald Trump. That would be a disaster on many levels.\n\nHouse Democrats might be able to avoid this outcome. They could do it by throwing their weight behind a moderate House Republican (and there are a few left - among the 18 in districts that Biden won in 2020 and whose political futures are imperiled by the Trump Republican extremists now taking over the House). Dems need peel off only five House Republicans to pull this off.\n\nPOLL: Should Trump be allowed to hold office again?\n\nBut first, let me give you a bit more background on Jordan.\n\nLast week, Trump endorsed Jordan for speaker. \"Congressman Jim Jordan has been a STAR long before making his very successful journey to Washington, D.C.,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social message . \"He will be a GREAT Speaker of the House, & has my Complete & Total Endorsement!\"\n\nOf course Trump endorsed Jordan. Jordan was an early and prominent supporter of Trump's big lie about the 2020 election being \"stolen\" from him. Just two days after Election Day, Jordan spoke at a \"Stop the Steal\" rally in Pennsylvania. In the following weeks, he frequently appeared on Fox News to buttress Trump's lie.\n\nJordan even attended White House meetings to develop strategies for reversing the election outcome. He sent a text message to then-White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows arguing that then-Vice President Mike Pence had the authority to stand in the way of the certification of the 2020 election.\n\nWhite House records show that Trump spoke on the phone with Jordan for 10 minutes on the morning of January 6, before Trump left the White House to give a speech to thousands of his supporters gathered at the Ellipse.\n\nThat afternoon, after pro-Trump supporters attacked the U.S. Capitol, then-Representative Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) told Jordan to get away from her because \"You f*ck*ng did this!\"\n\nJordan subsequently took to the House floor to object to the certification of President Joe Biden's Electoral College win.\n\nOn January 11, 2021 - five days after the attack and the attempt of some Republican lawmakers to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 presidential election - Trump awarded Jordan the Medal of Freedom, without any explanation of why Jordan deserved it. We can only surmise it was to reward Jordan for his loyalty to Trump.\n\nJordan later refused to cooperate with the House January 6 committee, despite being served with a subpoena.\n\nLike Trump, Jordan opposes continued U.S. support for Ukraine. He has consistently voted against measures that would increase security assistance to Ukraine.\n\nAnd don't expect Jordan to avoid a government shutdown. To the contrary, Jordan fomented the 2013 shutdown (which led then-Speaker John Boehner to call him a \"legislative terrorist\") and cheered on Trump's record-breaking 35-day shutdown over the border wall.\n\nLast week, in a speech at the University of Minnesota, Liz Cheney stated :\n\n***\n\nThere is a way out of this Trumpish hell hole. Democrats need only five Republican votes to cobble together their own governing coalition.\n\nThey can do this by reaching out to the Republicans who won their seats in districts that Biden won in 2020 - and who are politically imperiled by House Republican extremists.\n\nEither bring five of them across the aisle to make House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries the next Speaker. Or make one of them Speaker by promising them all House Democrats' votes if they can gather support from just five otherwise imperiled Republicans.\n\nWho might this be? Someone like Pennsylvania's Brian Fitzpatrick.\n\nFitzpatrick isn't perfect. He declined to vote to impeach Trump and voted against establishing the January 6 committee (even though he described the attack on the Capitol as an \"attempted coup\").\n\nBut Fitzpatrick would make a decent speaker. He has been ranked for three straight years as the most bipartisan member of the House by the The Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University. (Their annual bipartisan index measures how often a member of Congress introduces bills that attract co-sponsors from the opposition party, and how often they in turn co-sponsor bills introduced from across the aisle.)\n\nFitzpatrick co-chairs the House's Problem Solvers Caucus, which consists of 56 members - half Democrats, half Republicans - who are committed to finding \"common sense solutions to many of the country's toughest challenges.\" And it has found such common ground on issues ranging from gun violence to infrastructure to criminal justice reform.\n\nCommon sense. Common ground. My friends, it's possible. It has to be. The fate of the nation, and much of the world, depends on it."

We remain steadfast in our mission and are deeply grateful for the unwavering support of our friends and family during this time.\"\n\nJordan's subpoena is connected to his belief that New York Supreme Court Judge Juan Merchan - who presided over Donald Trump's hush money case - faced a conflict of interest due to his daughter's past work with Nellis' firm, Authentic Campaigns Inc.\n\nThe Associated Press reported earlier this month, that Loren Merchan \"met Harris occasionally in 2019 but never 'developed an individual relationship' with her,\" according to Nellis.\n\nThe news outlet noted that Authentic Campaigns Inc. has not worked for Harris' campaign during the 2024 election cycle.\n\nMSNBC's Katie Phang replied to Nellis' post, writing : \"Jim Jordan IGNORED a Congressional subpoena issued by the January 6th House Select Committee. But Jordan insists that others comply when it's nothing but a baseless harassment campaign? In Jim Jordan's world, it's 'Rules for thee, but not for me.'\""

Jim Jordan's demand for documents but calls his 'investigation' of her office 'politically motivated.'\"\n\nOn February 2, Jordan issued a subpoena to the district attorney \"over claims that her office misused federal grant funds and fired a whistleblower.\"\n\nThe subpoena, however, has no connection to Willis' criminal case against ex-President Donald Trump and 18 others over their attempt to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nNewsweek reports earlier this month, the Judiciary Committee chair \" sent another letter to Willis threatening to hold her in contempt of Congress if she did not provide further documents by March 28.\"\n\nIn her letter addressed to Jordan on Wednesday, March 26, Willis writes :\n\nI am in receipt of your letter dated March 14, 2024. I categorically reject the assertion that this office is deficient in responding to the Committee's subpoena dated February 2, 2024. As you note in your letter, we have already provided you with substantial information about our programs that are funded via federal grants.\n\nFurther, as I expressed to you in my letter dated February 23, 2024, this office is in the process of producing relevant documents to you on a rolling basis and is undertaking a good faith effort to provide you with responsive information about our federal grant funding. As part of that ongoing process, we are again today making a document production.\n\nYour primary complaint appears to be that we did not complete the production of your extensive document demands (including five categories of documents over a four-year period) in less than two months. That demand is unreasonable and uncustomary and would require this government office to divert resources from our primary purpose of prosecuting crime.\n\nLet me be clear, while we are abiding by your subpoena in good faith and with due diligence, we will not divert resources that undermine our duty to the people of Fulton County to prosecute felonies committed in this jurisdiction. We will not shut down this office's efforts to prosecute crime - including gang activity, acts of violence and public corruption - to meet unreasonable deadlines in your politically motivated 'investigation' of this office.\n\nWillis concludes, \"My family, my staff and I have been threatened repeatedly by people making violent, often racist, attacks. Neither those threats, nor anything your colleagues and you say or do, will deter us from fulfilling our duty to bring this case to trial.\""

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Rep. Jim Jordan has such a reputation as a political brawler that former House Speaker John Boehner once said he'd never met someone \"who spent more time tearing things apart.\"\n\nNow, nearly a decade after Boehner stepped down in the face of a conservative revolt, it is Jordan, of Ohio, who is trying to bring the Republican Party together to win the speaker's gavel.\n\nA favorite of former President Donald Trump and darling of the party's rabble-rousing base, Jordan's path to the U.S. government's third-highest office is by no means certain in a House Republican conference riven by conflict following the ouster two weeks ago of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy. To win, Jordan will need support from nearly every House Republican, having few votes to spare in a chamber they only narrowly control.\n\nShould Jordan succeed, it would help cement the far right's takeover of the Republican Party and trigger fresh conflict with Democrats over the size and scope of government. But a Jordan speakership would also come with baggage that could present a challenge to Republicans as they labor to hold their House majority in next year's election, an effort that will likely hinge on drawing support from moderate voters in swing districts.\n\nSome members of Congress - including those in his own party - label Jordan an extremist unworthy of the speakership, pointing to his active role in Trump's bid to stop the certification of the 2020 presidential election, as well as his refusal to honor a congressional subpoena about the Jan. 6 attack at the Capitol . Further in his past, Jordan continues to be questioned over his alleged knowledge of sexual abuse in the wrestling program at Ohio State University - an accusation he adamantly denies.\n\nFormer Rep. Liz Cheney, who helped lead the Jan. 6 investigation and was ousted from GOP leadership by conservatives, has warned that giving Jordan the gavel could even pose a threat to democracy itself.\n\n\"If the Republicans decide that Jim Jordan should be the speaker of the House,\" Cheney, of Wyoming, said during a recent speech, \"there would no longer be any possible way to argue that a group of elected Republicans could be counted on to defend the Constitution.\"\n\nJordan has defended his bare-knuckled approach as rooted in principle, a message that resonates with conservatives who have long accused GOP leaders of capitulation.\n\n\"One person says disruption,\" Jordan told The Associated Press in 2017. \"We like to say we're doing what we told the voters we were going to do.\"\n\nJordan, a 59-year-old father of four, was born near Dayton in western Ohio. He was a four-time state wrestling champion in high school and a two-time NCAA champion at the University of Wisconsin in the 1980s. That helped him land a coaching job at Ohio State University before his election to the Ohio legislature in the mid 1990s.\n\nHis conservatism and zeal for a political fight were evident in early clashes with GOP legislative leaders, as well as with Republican Gov. Bob Taft.\n\nWhen he decided to pursue a state Senate seat in 1999, he faced opposition from the GOP establishment and from Boehner, then a four-term congressman, who supported a rival. Jordan easily won, ousting a veteran state representative with nearly 60% of the vote. Jordan was elected to Congress several years later, in 2006.\n\nAfter the tea party wave swept Republicans to power in 2011, the roles reversed, and Jordan was among the conservatives who were frequently Boehner's tormentors.\n\nJordan was the founding chairman in 2015 of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of conservative hardliners who eventually pressured Boehner to step aside. More than eight years later, members of the group were instrumental in McCarthy's removal, a stunning outcome and testament to the group's outsized power.\n\nBut it is Jordan's past as a wrestling coach - a sport he described as \"good for a society\" - that has posed one of his biggest political liabilities.\n\nIn 2018, several former athletes he coached at Ohio State came forward to describe a lurid atmosphere surrounding the school's wrestling program when Jordan was an assistant coach. The allegations centered around sexual misconduct by Richard Strauss, a doctor who was on the faculty and medical staff.\n\nJordan would \"even make comments: 'This guy better not touch me,'\" Dunyasha Yetts, one of the wrestlers, told AP in 2018.\n\nA subsequent investigation found Strauss, who died by suicide in 2005, groped or sexually assaulted nearly 200 students, many of them wrestlers seeking medical care. Since then, even more former wrestlers Jordan coached have come forward to say that Jordan was aware of the doctor's conduct but did nothing to stop it, which Jordan denies.\n\n\"It's false. I never saw, never, heard of, never was told about any kind of abuse,\" Jordan told Fox News in 2018, suggesting that the allegations against him were politically motivated. \"What bothers me the most is the guys that are saying these things, I know they know the truth.\"\n\nAdam DiSabato, a former Ohio State wrestling captain and brother to one of the early whistleblowers, offered an unsparing assessment during a 2020 legislative hearing in Columbus. DiSabato testified that he repeatedly urged Jordan and others on the coaching staff to intervene.\n\n\"Jim Jordan called me crying ... begging me to go against my brother,\" DiSabato said, referring to a call he said he received after the abuse allegations first became public. \"He's throwing us under the bus - all of us. He's a coward.\"\n\nOhio State has since doled out tens of millions of dollars in settlements. Jordan's political committee paid $84,000 to a conservative public relations firm in 2018 to help manage the fallout, campaign finance disclosures show.\n\nUnlike many in Congress, Jordan has not adopted some of the flashier trappings of office, appearing regularly in a blue button-up and gold tie, sans jacket and with his shirt sleeves rolled up. Nor, unlike many of his peers, does Jordan appear to have experienced a dramatic improvement in his personal finances while serving in Congress, public financial disclosures show.\n\nWhen Jordan first entered Congress, his wife, Polly, earned a modest salary from a western Ohio school district while he relied on a mid-five-figure income from a deferred compensation plan. His most recent disclosure, filed last year, show Jordan's net worth has improved only slightly, thanks to his $174,000 salary as a congressman and royalties from a political memoir.\n\n\"It's true, retail legislative activity for him, so there's no like, 'I'm gonna buy a house in Washington and live there,'\" said Ohio Senate President Matt Huffman, a longtime ally. \"He's doesn't have any interest in that.\"\n\nJordan's skill set proved particularly useful in the politically charged years after Trump won the White House.\n\nHis allegiance was on full display during the Justice Department's investigation into potential coordination between Russia and Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, when he used his platform on the House Judiciary Committee to rail against the probe as politically motivated and to attack the law enforcement officials who supervised it.\n\nIn recognition of Jordan's growing influence, Republicans moved him to the House Intelligence committee during the first impeachment proceedings against Trump in 2019. And when Republicans won the House in last year's election, Jordan secured the chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee, one of the most prestigious posts in Congress - and one well-suited to his combative style.\n\nIn tense hearings this year, Jordan has sparred with Cabinet secretaries, FBI officials and ambassadors alike, accusing them all of taking part in a \"weaponization\" of government against conservatives. Jordan comes to the hearings with a wrestler's mindset, trying to anticipate his opponents' moves ahead of time during preparatory sessions in his Capitol Hill office.\n\nJordan is also among the Republicans leading the impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden . Republicans say the investigation is needed to root out whether the Biden family corruptly profited from their connections in Washington.\n\nBut it was in the period after Trump lost the election to Biden in 2020 that Jordan's strongest connections to the former president were forged, with Jordan repeatedly casting doubt on the outcome of the contest while organizing the House Republican response.\n\nDocuments obtained by Congress through its investigation of the attack offer a window into his involvement in Trump's bid to stay in office.\n\nDays after the election, Jordan traveled with fellow GOP Rep. Scott Perry to Pennsylvania to meet with the Republican state House speaker, where the two congressmen \"raised some questions regarding what I'll call the legal process,\" then-Speaker Bryan Cutler told investigators.\n\nOn Dec. 21, 2020, Jordan was among those attending a White House meeting focused on pressuring then Vice President Mike Pence to use his ceremonial role presiding over the electoral college to overturn the election, according to documents from the investigation.\n\nJordan also hosted a Jan. 2, 2021 conference call with the White House to discuss logistics for Jan. 6, including Republican plans to object to the election's certification, according to call logs and testimony from Cassidy Hutchinson, an aide to Trump's chief of staff Mark Meadows.\n\nJordan also called Trump twice on Jan. 6 - both before and after the attack.\n\nDuring Trump's speech that day, which preceded the Capitol attack, he singled out Jordan for praise.\n\n\"There's so many weak Republicans. And we have great ones - Jim Jordan and some of these guys, they're out there fighting,\" Trump said. \"The House guys are fighting.\"\n\nIn the days after the Capitol was attacked, Jordan raised the possibility of getting presidential pardons for members of Congress, though he never directly asked for one for himself, Hutchinson told the congressional committee.\n\nA week later, Trump presented Jordan with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)\n\nBOARDMAN, Ohio (AP) - For years, the sign had been sitting in a corner of the Republican Party headquarters in Mahoning County, Ohio, gathering dust.\n\n\"Welcome future Speaker of House Jim Jordan ,\" it said.\n\nDonald Skowron, a retired Youngstown police officer who had stenciled the sign back in 2015, made sure it was back on display, spruced up for the occasion, as Jordan stopped by last week for a campaign visit ahead of this year's election.\n\nJordan didn't acknowledge the sign and instead focused his brief remarks on the candidates in Ohio's most competitive races that could determine control of the House and Senate.\n\nBut the Ohio Republican's leadership ambitions have been vividly apparent, if unspoken, as he engages on a multi-state tour aimed at bolstering House Republican candidates.\n\nJordan denies that he's running for any leadership job, telling The Associated Press in an interview in the lobby of a Marriott hotel that his aims are to help maintain Republican control and lead the House Judiciary Committee for another two years.\n\n\"I'm focused,\" Jordan said when asked about running for a leadership position, and then he shifted gears. \"We're going to win, and Mike Johnson is going to be speaker and President Trump is going to be in the White House,\" he said.\n\nYet the 60-year-old has spent the runup to Election Day acting less like a powerful committee chairman and more like an \"informal\" member of the House Republican leadership team, according to GOP lawmakers and aides. Many see his activities as a shadow race of sorts to become GOP leader, particularly if the party loses its majority and seeks a fresh start.\n\nJordan has appeared with incumbents and candidates in Colorado, Arkansas, Missouri and Michigan. And he's been active in his home state of Ohio, which has two of the most competitive House races in the country.\n\nRep. Michael Rulli, R-Ohio, who spent several days with Jordan as he trekked across the state from Toledo to Akron, said Jordan has been \"working around the clock.\"\n\n\"I do think he's kind of an informal member of the leadership team,\" Republican candidate Kevin Coughlin, who is running in a tight race for Ohio's 13th District, told the AP. \"There's no question about that, that he's part of decision making.\"\n\nOnce loathed by Republican leaders, Jordan has evolved from outside agitator to party asset. The change has come amid a broader transformation in the GOP, first under the Tea Party and now in the age of Trump as he seeks another term in the White House.\n\nCoughlin, who has known Jordan since the two men both served in the Ohio Statehouse, said Jordan \"has figured out how to walk the balance between principle and effectiveness.\"\n\n\"You know, if you're one of those folks that just wants to burn the place down when you don't get your way every time, you're not going to be a very effective person,\" Coughlin said. \"And I think he's figured that out.\"\n\nJordan is a beloved figure within the GOP base in part because of his pugilistic style on Capitol Hill, where he is known for sparring with Democrats in committee hearings.\n\nRepublicans facing both tough and easy races across the country have been eager to appear alongside Jordan, wanting both the enthusiasm he brings as voters line up to take a selfie with the MAGA favorite, and the fundraising boost he generates with conservative donors.\n\nIn the last month alone, Jordan handed over $1.5 million to the National Republican Congressional Committee, the campaign arm for GOP races, according to recent Federal Election Commission disclosures. That makes the total he's given this cycle $2.5 million, one of the heftier sums he's contributed since arriving in Washington in 2007.\n\nOne Republican aide said Jordan's cash flow came at an hour of need as the party had been struggling for months to compete with Democrats' fundraising numbers.\n\nTo be sure, Jordan's campaign activities are dwarfed by that of Speaker Johnson, who has been crisscrossing the country for months in his role as GOP majority maker, raising more than $26 million for the NRCC since securing the gavel a year ago. While his future in leadership is far from assured, Johnson has a powerful ally in Trump. Should Republicans win the majority, his ability to gain the gavel would be significantly strengthened.\n\nAnd despite his popularity with colleagues, Jordan's potential campaign for a leadership role faces a major obstacle: Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise , the House majority leader.\n\nScalise is also well-liked among colleagues and has over the years been a fundraising powerhouse for House Republicans, building valuable support in any leadership race. In the last few months alone, Scalise has raised $15.2 million for NRCC, according to financial disclosures, making his total raised this cycle a little more than $55 million.\n\nBut Scalise made his own failed run for speaker last year as he dealt with medical treatments for blood cancer. He assured colleagues he was up to the job despite his health challenges.\n\nFor now, Jordan is building bridges and allies in unexpected corners of the party, seeking to prove that his political skillset goes beyond being a firebrand and showing loyalty to Trump.\n\n\"I learned a long time ago that winning beats losing. So, we're trying to win. And we're trying to help everybody,\" Jordan told the AP.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

Jim Jordan failed again Wednesday on a crucial second ballot to become House speaker, but the hard-fighting ally of Donald Trump showed no signs of dropping out despite losing support from even more of his GOP colleagues.\n\nNext steps were highly uncertain as angry, frustrated Republicans looked at other options. A bipartisan group of lawmakers floated an extraordinary plan - to give the interim speaker pro tempore, Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., more power to reopen the immobilized House and temporarily conduct routine business. But that seems doubtful, for now.\n\nWhat was clear was that Jordan's path to become House speaker was almost certainly lost. He was opposed by 22 Republicans, two more than he lost in first-round voting the day before. Many view the Ohio congressman as too extreme for a central seat of U.S. power and resented the harassing hardball tactics from Jordan's allies for their votes. One lawmaker said they had received death threats.\n\n\"We'll keep talking to members, keep working on it,\" Jordan, a founding member of the hard-right Freedom Caucus, said after the vote.\n\nThe House came to another abrupt standstill, stuck now 15 days since the sudden ouster of Kevin McCarthy without a speaker - a position of power second in line to the presidency.\n\nOnce a formality in Congress, the vote for House speaker has devolved into a bitter GOP showdown for the gavel with no foreseeable end. Jordan is resisting entreaties to step aside and no other politically viable candidate is emerging to unite the ruptured Republican majority.\n\nAs Republicans upset and exhausted by the infighting retreated for private conversations, hundreds of demonstrators amassed outside the Capitol over the Israel-Hamas war , a stark reminder of the concern over having the House adrift as political challenges intensify at home and abroad.\n\n\"The way out is that Jim Jordan has got to pull his name,\" said Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., who voted twice against him. \"He's going to have to call it quits.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries of N.Y., speaks to reporters on the steps of the Capitol after Republicans failed in their first attempt to elect Rep.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)\n\nAfter Wednesday's vote , McCarthy and other party leaders appeared to tentatively rally around Jordan, giving the combative Judiciary Committee chairman the time he was demanding, though it was doubtful he could shore up votes. No further action was scheduled and the House lost another day.\n\nWith Republicans in majority control of the House, 221-212, Jordan must pick up most of his GOP foes to win. Wednesday's tally, with 199 Republicans voting for Jordan and 212 for Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York, left no candidate with a clear majority.\n\nAs the rollcall got underway, Jordan lost more than he gained, picking up three backers but adding more detractors.\n\nThe holdouts added to a surprisingly large and politically diverse group of 20 Republicans who had rejected Jordan's nomination the day before.\n\nJordan's refusal to concede only further embittered some of the Republicans, who were upset that the party's first choice, Majority Leader Steve Scalise, was essentially forced to drop his own bid 24 hours after a failed vote last week in large part because Jordan's backers team refused to give their support.\n\nBipartisan groups of lawmakers have been floating ways to operate the House by giving greater power to McHenry or another temporary speaker. The House had never ousted its speaker before McCarthy, and McHenry could tap the temporary powers that were created after the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks to ensure continuity of government.\n\nRep.

Scott Applewhite)\n\nThe novel concept of boosting the interim speaker's role was gaining favor with a pair of high-profile Republicans: former GOP speakers Newt Gingrich and John Boehner.\n\nGingrich said while he likes Jordan, he has \"no faith\" the nominee can get much beyond the 200 votes he won in the first vote.\n\nBoehner reposted Gingrich's views saying, \"I agree,\" on social media.\n\nThe two men have deep experience with the subject. Both were chased to early retirement.\n\n\"All options are on the table to end the Republican civil war,\" Jeffries said Wednesday.\n\nBut McHenry appeared to brush off the idea of taking further powers for himself, saying Jordan \"has the support of the conference to keep going, so that's what we're gonna do.\"\n\nMcHenry added that he finds himself in an unprecedented position and has constructed his role \"as narrowly as the rules say I should, and we can't transact business until we elect a speaker.\"\n\nIn nominating Jordan, veteran Republican Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma said it was time to end the upheaval that he had warned against with McCarthy's sudden ouster.\n\n\"We have a chance today to end that chaos, end that uncertainty,\" Cole said.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Pete Aguilar of California nominated Jeffries, noting the Democratic leader continues to win more votes and is the best choice to move the country forward.\n\n\"The country cannot afford more delays and more chaos,\" Aguilar said.\n\nJordan had relied on backing from Trump, the party's front-runner in the 2024 election to challenge President Joe Biden, and groups pressuring rank-and-file lawmakers for the vote, but they were not enough and in fact backfired on some.\n\n\"One thing I cannot stomach or support is a bully,\" said a statement from Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, R-Iowa, who voted against Jordan on the second ballot and said she received \"credible death threats and a barrage of threatening calls.\"\n\nFlexing their independence, the holdouts are a mix of pragmatists - ranging from seasoned legislators and committee chairs worried about governing, to newer lawmakers from districts where voters prefer Biden to Trump.\n\nInstead, the holdouts cast their ballots for McCarthy, Scalise and others, with one vote even going to the retired Boehner.\n\nJordan has been a top Trump ally, particularly during the Jan. 6 Capitol attack by the former president's backers who were trying to overturn the 2020 election he lost to Biden. Days later, Trump awarded Jordan a Medal of Freedom .\n\nThe political climb has been steep for Jordan, who is known more as a chaos agent than a skilled legislator, raising questions about how he would lead. Congress faces daunting challenges, risking a federal shutdown at home if it fails to fund the government and fielding Biden's requests for aid to help Ukraine and Israel in the wars abroad.\n\nFirst elected in 2006, Jordan has few bills to his name from his time in office. He also faces questions about his past. Some years ago, Jordan denied allegations from former wrestlers during his time as an assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University who accused him of knowing about claims they were inappropriately groped by an Ohio State doctor. Jordan has said he was never aware of any abuse.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Kevin Freking and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)\n\nURBANA, Ohio (AP) - Rep. Jim Jordan, so far, has failed to get the needed votes to become House Speaker but his fight for the coveted leadership role isn't done , and the devotion of many of his constituents back in Ohio seems unwavering.\n\nIn Washington, Jordan has made a name for himself as a conservative pugilist - in line with his avid supporter, former President Donald Trump - by being unafraid to duke it out in the political arena, especially against his Democratic colleagues. He's a founder of the Freedom Caucus, a contingent of cantankerous and often chaotic far-right House Republicans, and he's one of the loudest voices continuing to perpetuate false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.\n\nIn Ohio, Jordan is a hometown boy whose Ohio State University wrestling coach title, conservative policies and never-say-die persona on Capitol Hill have earned him more devotion than he's currently receiving in Congress.\n\n\"He says what he believes in, because he's there for the people,\" said Betty Lemmon, a 77-year-old Republican from Champaign County. Jordan, she said, would make an excellent House speaker, citing a track record of his leading the ideological charge for Trump, who she voted for in both the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections.\n\nIt was a common theme on a cloudy fall day in downtown Urbana, Ohio - an oasis of cafes and antique stores in the sprawling, rich farmland that makes up most of Jordan's district. It's a district Jordan won with nearly 70 percent of the vote in the last election, and one that the Ohio Supreme Court has ruled multiple times to be unconstitutional under gerrymandered congressional maps drawn by Jordan's fellow Republicans.\n\nConstituents interviewed by the Associated Press applauded his fighting spirit and conservative stances on federal issues like border security and abortion. Several liked that he still refuses to comply with a congressional subpoena about the Jan. 6 attack at the Capitol and is leading the impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden , touting a \"stick it to the man\" attitude.\n\nCynthia Leach, a Republican store owner in Urbana's Monument Square, called Jordan \"not easily persuaded\" and \"forceful\" - qualities she said she admires in a leader.\n\nBut for all his stances and inquiries, Jordan's achievements as a legislator are harder to spot. While Russell Dye, a spokesperson for Jordan, noted in an email that Jordan has signed his name to support over 60 bills created by other legislators that have become law, no bill Jordan has sponsored himself has had much movement in the House since he was first elected in 2006.\n\nWhen asked about what Jordan has done specifically for his district, Dye did not cite any of Jordan's legislation, but instead pointed to casework for constituents. \"Congressman Jordan has always done what he told the voters he would do - whether it's assisting seniors getting Medicare and Social Security benefits, expediting passports, helping veterans, meeting with thousands of constituents, or touring hundreds of businesses in Ohio's 4th district - and the constituents know it.\"\n\nBut there are voices critical of Jordan even in the heavily Republican district.\n\nSherry Vaught, a Democratic mayoral candidate in Mansfield, had harsh criticism for the Ohio congressman as his possible speakership looms. She said Jordan has been too busy dividing the U.S. House to get any real work done for the people he represents.\n\n\"While he's busy scoring points in political theater and pursuing partisan agendas, the people are struggling with real issues right here at home,\" Vaught said in a statement.\n\nBut what Jordan's done so far appeals to his supporters, who said they are proud to have such a vocal, well-known and brawling representative in their corner. They're happy that he's become a Trump darling, a possible federal leader and one of the most talked about politicians in the country.\n\nHow he gets people talking is part of his appeal, said Herb Asher, a political science professor at The Ohio State University. Jordan's seat is ideal for a Republican like him - a red district in a red state that's embraced more radical Republicans like Sen. J.D. Vance in recent years.\n\n\"There are many people who are happy to have a member of Congress who says what they think,\" Asher said.\n\nJD Knopp, an 18-year-old resident of Mechanicsburg, Ohio just outside Urbana, said he thinks Jordan will make a great leader for a divided Republican party.\n\n\"He doesn't take crap off of anybody. He's a country boy,\" he said.\n\nKnopp likes that Jordan puts other politicians \"in their place\" and his \"drain the swamp\" mentality. Whether Jordan becomes speaker won't affect his opinion, but it might change how he views those who keep the congressman from winning the speakership.\n\n\"I guess they're RINOs, then,\" Knopp shrugged, referring to a term used to describe \"Republicans in name only.\"\n\n___\n\nSamantha Hendrickson is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Former President Donald Trump is backing Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, the pugnacious House Judiciary Committee chairman and longtime Trump defender, to succeed Kevin McCarthy as House speaker .\n\n\"Congressman Jim Jordan has been a STAR long before making his very successful journey to Washington, D.C., representing Ohio's 4th Congressional District,\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social site early Friday. \"He will be a GREAT Speaker of the House, & has my Complete & Total Endorsement!\"\n\nThe announcement came hours after Texas Rep. Troy Nehls said Thursday night that Trump had decided to back Jordan's bid and after Trump said he would be open to serving as interim leader himself if Republicans couldn't settle on a successor following McCarthy's stunning ouster .\n\nTrump, the current GOP presidential front-runner, has used the leadership vacuum on the Hill to further demonstrate his control over the Republican Party. House Republicans are deeply fractured and some have been asking him to lead them - a seemingly fanciful suggestion that he also promoted after inflaming the divisions that forced out McCarthy as speaker.\n\nTrump had been telling people in recent days that he preferred Jordan for the post, according to two Republicans familiar with his thinking and granted anonymity to discuss it. But it was unclear whether he intended to announce it before Nehls' tweet.\n\n\"Just had a great conversation with President Trump about the Speaker's race. He is endorsing Jim Jordan, and I believe Congress should listen to the leader of our party,\" Nehls wrote late Thursday on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nIn an interview later with The Associated Press, Nehls, who had been encouraging Trump to run for the post himself, said the ex-president instead wanted Jordan.\n\n\"After him thinking about it and this and that ... he said he really is in favor of getting behind Jim Jordan,\" Nehls said. \"He believes Jim Jordan is right for the job.\"\n\nJordan is one of two leading candidates maneuvering for speaker along with Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana. Both are trying to lock in the 218 votes required to win the job and need the support of both the far-right and moderate factions of the party. It's unclear whether Trump's endorsement will force Scalise, the current GOP majority leader, out of the race, or if either can reach the threshold.\n\nIndeed, Nehls said that if no current candidate succeeds in earning the support needed to win, he would once again turn to Trump. \"Our conference is divided. Our country is broken. I don't know who can get to 218,\" he said in the interview.\n\nTrump earlier in the day had been in talks to visit Capitol Hill next week ahead of a speakership vote that could happen as soon as Wednesday, according to three people familiar with the discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of an official announcement. Trump confirmed the trip to Fox News Digital and said he would travel Tuesday to meet with Republicans.\n\nThe trip would have been Trump's first to the Capitol since leaving office and since his supporters attacked the building in a bid to halt the peaceful transition of power on Jan. 6, 2021. Trump has been indicted in both Washington and Georgia over his efforts to overturn the results of the election, which he lost to President Joe Biden.\n\nNehls, however, said it was unlikely Trump would make the trip following the endorsement.\n\nJordan is one of Trump's biggest champions on the Hill and has been leading the investigations into prosecutors who have charged the former president. He was also part of a group of Republicans who worked with Trump to overturn his defeat ahead of Jan. 6.\n\nScalise has also worked closely with Trump over the years.\n\nOne of the people familiar with the planning had cautioned earlier Thursday that, if Trump did go ahead with the visit, he would be there to talk with Republican lawmakers and not to pitch himself for the role.\n\nStill, Trump continued to stoke speculation, telling Fox News Digital Thursday that he would accept a short-term role as speaker - for anywhere from 30 to 90 days - if another candidate doesn't have the votes to win.\n\n\"I have been asked to speak as a unifier because I have so many friends in Congress,\" he told the outlet. \"If they don't get the vote, they have asked me if I would consider taking the speakership until they get somebody longer-term, because I am running for president.\"\n\nIn a social media post earlier in the day, he added that he \"will do whatever is necessary to help with the Speaker of the House selection process, short term, until the final selection of a GREAT REPUBLICAN SPEAKER is made - A Speaker who will help a new, but highly experienced President, ME, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\"\n\nThe Republican conference is filled with members generally supportive of Trump, but whether they'd back him to serve as speaker remained to be seen. The role is a demanding position - effectively running the Capitol and dealing with hundreds of lawmakers - and requires an attention to the arcane details of legislating that Trump showed little interest in even when he was president.\n\nWhile he is dominating his GOP presidential rivals, Trump is also still traveling to early primary states to campaign and has been spending much of his time focused on the four criminal indictments and several civil cases he is facing.\n\nWhile there is no requirement that a person be elected to the House to serve as speaker, every one of the 55 speakers the House has elected has been a member of the chamber. From time to time, lawmakers have thrown their votes to those outside of Congress, often as a protest against the candidates running.\n\nTrump helped McCarthy win the speakership in January after 15 rounds of voting. But he exhorted Republicans to impeach Biden and to reject deals that McCarthy negotiated. Last month, he urged the right flank to support a government shutdown if Republicans did not win deep spending cuts, declaring on social media that the GOP \"lost big on Debt Ceiling, got NOTHING, and now are worried that they will be BLAMED for the Budget Shutdown. Wrong!!! Whoever is President will be blamed, in this case, Crooked (as Hell!) Joe Biden!\"\n\nMcCarthy ultimately moved to keep the government open for 45 days without the cuts demanded by hard-right conservatives. Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican and longtime Trump ally, cited that decision as reason to move to depose the speaker.\n\nAmong those who had pushed Trump for speaker was Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a longtime Trump ally who didn't vote to remove McCarthy. She posted on X that she believed \"he would take the job.\"\n\nNehls, the Texas Republican who was among the first to promote Trump for the job, said before his Thursday evening conservation with Trump that he'd been contacted \"by multiple Members of Congress willing to support and offer nomination speeches for Donald J. Trump to be Speaker of the House.\"\n\n\"Next week,\" he wrote on X, \"is going to be HUGE.\"\n\n___ Colvin reported from New York.

Scott Applewhite)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Republicans abruptly dropped Rep. Jim Jordan on Friday as their nominee for House speaker, making the decision during a closed-door session after the hard-edged ally of Donald Trump failed badly on a third ballot for the gavel.\n\nThe outcome left Republicans dejected, frustrated and sinking deeper into turmoil, another week without a House speaker bordering on a full-blown crisis. House Republicans have no realistic or working plan to unite the fractured GOP majority, elect a new speaker and return to the work of Congress that has been languishing since hard-liners ousted Kevin McCarthy at the start of the month.\n\nAfterward, Jordan said simply of his colleagues, \"We put the question to them, they made a different decision.\"\n\nThe hard-charging Judiciary Committee chairman said House Republicans now need to come together and \"figure out who our speaker is going to be.\"\n\nTheir majority control floundering, Republicans left the private session blaming one another for the divisions they have created. Next steps were highly uncertain, as a wide range of Republican lawmakers started pitching themselves for speaker.\n\nBut it appears no one at present can win a GOP majority, leaving the House without a speaker and unable to function for the foreseeable future, an embarrassing blow to a central U.S. seat of government.\n\n\"We're in a very bad place right now,\" McCarthy said.\n\nMajority Leader Steve Scalise said they would \"start over\" Monday. New nominees are to come forward for a candidate forum and internal party votes.\n\nExasperated with no easy solutions in sight, Rep. Mark Alford, a freshman from Missouri, was far from alone in expressing his anger and disappointment.\n\n\"I gave up my career to come here to do something for America, to rebuild our military, to get spending under control, to secure our border - and here we are in this quicksand,\" he said.\n\nIn a floor vote Friday morning, Jordan's third reach for the gavel, he lost 25 Republican colleagues, worse than he had fared earlier in the week, and leaving him far from the majority needed.\n\nA founder of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, Jordan's run essentially collapsed in large part because more centrist Republicans are revolting over the nominee they view as too extreme and the hardball tactics being used to win their votes. They have been bombarded with harassing phone calls and even reported death threats .\n\nTo win over GOP colleagues, Jordan had relied on backing from Trump, the party's front-runner in the 2024 election, and groups pressuring rank-and-file lawmakers for the vote. But they were not enough and in fact backfired on some.\n\nFriday's vote was 194 for Jordan, his lowest tally yet, and 210 for Jeffries, with two absences on each side.\n\nIn fact, Jordan lost rather than gained votes despite hours spent trying to win over holdouts, no improvement from the 20 and then 22 Republicans he lost in early rounds this week.\n\nMcCarthy himself rose in the chamber to nominate Jordan, portraying him as a skilled legislator who reaches for compromise. That drew scoffs of laughter from the Democratic side of the aisle.\n\nDemocrats nominated Leader Hakeem Jeffries, with Rep. Katherine Clark calling Jordan, who refused to certify the 2020 presidential election results, \"a threat to democracy.\"\n\nAt a fundraiser Friday night, President Joe Biden offered his own commentary on Jordan's failure: \"He just got his rear end kicked.\"\n\nFor more than two weeks the stalemate has shut down the U.S. House, leaving a major part of the government severely hobbled at a time of challenges at home and abroad . While Democrats have offered to broker a bipartisan deal to reopen the House, the Republican majority appears to have no idea how to end the political turmoil and get back to work.\n\nWith Republicans in control of the House, 221-212, any candidate can lose only a few detractors. It appears there is no Republican at present who can win a clear majority, 217 votes, to become speaker.\n\nOne extraordinary idea, to give the interim speaker pro tempore, Rep. Patrick McHenry , more powers for the next several months to at least bring the House back into session and conduct crucial business, was swiftly rejected by Jordan's own ultra-conservative allies and brushed back by McHenry himself.\n\nA \"betrayal,\" said Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind.\n\nRepublicans predict the House could essentially stay closed until the mid-November deadline for Congress to approve funding or risk a federal government shutdown.\n\n\"We're trying to figure out if there's a way we can get back with a Republican-only solution,\" said veteran legislator Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla.\n\n\"That's what normal majorities do. What this majority has done is prove it's not a normal majority.\"\n\nWhat's potentially more unsettling is that it's not at all clear what the House Republicans are even fighting over any more - let alone if any GOP leader can fix it.\n\nThe Republican chaos that erupted Oct. 3, when a small band of eight hardliners led by Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida orchestrated McCarthy's historic ouster, has cascaded into angry grievances, new factions and untested alliances.\n\nGaetz and the hardliners wanted to punish McCarthy for a number of perceived wrongs, including passing legislation with Democrats to keep the government funded and prevent a federal shutdown.\n\nBut when Scalise won the nomination to replace McCarthy, Jordan's allies broke from party rules and blocked the Louisianan's rise. Scalise abruptly withdrew his nomination.\n\nAngry that Scalise didn't seem to get fair treatment, more mainstream Republicans staged their own revolt against hard-liner Jordan, saying he didn't deserve the gavel.\n\nWeeks of heated, fiery meetings later, Republicans have drifted far off track from what had been their House majority's stated priorities of cutting spending and other goals.\n\nDemocratic Leader Jeffries reiterated that his party was \"ready, willing and able\" to work with more traditional Republicans on a path to reopen the House -- particularly as Congress is being asked to consider Biden's aid package for Israel, Ukraine and other needs.\n\nJordan has been a top Trump ally, particularly during the Jan. 6 Capitol attack by the former president's backers who were trying to overturn the 2020 election he lost to Biden. Days later, Trump awarded Jordan a Medal of Freedom .\n\nFirst elected in 2006, Jordan has few bills to his name from his time in office. He also faces questions about his past.\n\nSome years ago, Jordan denied allegations from former wrestlers during his time as an assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University who accused him of knowing about claims they were inappropriately groped by an Ohio State doctor.

Scott Applewhite)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Rep. Jim Jordan faced strong opposition to his House speakership bid Tuesday as 20 Republicans voted against him on a first ballot. The chamber adjourned for the day as the Ohio Republican worked to flip some of his detractors his way.\n\nIt's the second time this Congress that the House has faced multiple rounds of voting for speaker, following the protracted struggle in January, when Kevin McCarthy won the gavel on the 15th attempt.\n\nTwenty GOP lawmakers voted for a candidate other than Jordan, as many protested the removal of McCarthy as speaker earlier this month and the process that has unfolded to replace him.\n\nConservatives have been mounting an intense pressure campaign to persuade the final holdouts to support Jordan, but some of his opponents appear even more determined to stop him from becoming speaker.\n\nJordan will need to flip at least 16 Republicans to become speaker, as Democrats are certain to continue backing their own nominee, Leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York. Republicans currently control the House 221-212.\n\nThe House is expected to come back for a second round of voting on Wednesday.\n\nJordan loses first vote for House speaker\n\nHere's what to know ahead of more voting for speaker:\n\nWHEN IS THE SPEAKER ELECTION? AND HOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nThe House gaveled into session Tuesday at noon to hold what would be the first of several votes to elect a speaker. It's a speaker's election unlike any other following the removal of McCarthy, R-Calif., who was suddenly and unexpectedly ousted from the post after just nine months on the job.\n\nThe speaker is normally elected every two years, in January, when the House organizes for a new session. A new election can only be held if the speaker dies, resigns or is removed from office.\n\nOnce the House was in a quorum - meaning a minimum number of members were present to proceed - each party nominated its candidate for speaker. Republicans nominated Jordan. Democrats once again nominated Jeffries and are expected to continue to vote for him in unison.\n\nHouse members remained present during the speakership vote. It's one of the few times - including for the State of the Union Address - that lawmakers are all seated in the chamber.\n\nRep.

Scott Applewhite)\n\nHOW MANY VOTES DOES IT TAKE TO ELECT A SPEAKER?\n\nIt takes a majority of the votes from House members who are present and voting to elect a speaker. There were 432 Democrats and Republicans in attendance during Tuesday's vote, with one GOP lawmaker absent. Two House seats are currently vacant. That means Jordan or any other Republican candidate needs 217 votes to win.\n\nOnce the second roll call for speaker begins Wednesday, members of the House will once again call out their choices. The House will vote as many times as necessary until someone wins. Jordan made clear that he was not giving up after the first ballot.\n\n\"The House needs a speaker as soon as possible,\" Russell Dye, a spokesperson for Jordan, said in a statement. \"It's time for Republicans to come together.\"\n\nIt's uncertain how many rounds it might take for Jordan to clinch the gavel, but supporters have expressed confidence that the consecutive public floor votes will force holdouts to flip their way. McCarthy narrowly won the speakership in January on the 15th round of balloting , after five excruciating days.\n\nWHO IS SUPPORTING AND OPPOSING JORDAN?\n\nJordan, a darling of the party's hardline right-wing base, still faces opposition from some members of the conference who doubt his ability to lead.\n\n\"Being speaker of the House is not being the chairman,\" Rep. Mario Diaz Balart, one of the holdouts, said Friday. \"Because you deal with foreign policy, you deal with the heads of state, you deal with domestic policy and you deal with security issues.\"\n\nHe added, \"I think there are a lot of questions about whether he can unify and lead the conference, and whether he can even lead his own people, his closest people.\"\n\nSome Republicans are upset with how the speaker's race has played out.\n\nFILE - This image from House Television shows House Republican Whip Steve Scalise walking on the House floor of the Capitol in Washington, Thursday, Sept. 28, 2017.

Steve Scalise, the majority leader, first won his colleagues' nomination for speaker last week. Jordan, who came in second, threw his support behind Scalise, stating that he would support his nomination when it came to the floor and urging the rest of the conference to do the same. But more than a dozen Republicans refused to back Scalise, leading him to withdraw a day later.\n\nThose same members who refused to back Scalise are now Jordan's strongest base of support. They spent the weekend publicly and privately lobbying each of his critics to drop their opposition and become a \"team player.\" They say the party's grass-roots base pressure could prove decisive in the vote.\n\nOther Republicans opposing Jordan's speaker bid come from swing districts and are facing tough reelection races next year.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Signaling more turmoil ahead, Republicans rejected Rep. Jim Jordan for House speaker on a first ballot Tuesday, as a surprising 20 holdouts denied the hard-charging ally of Donald Trump the GOP majority needed to seize the gavel.\n\nAdditional voting was postponed as the House hit a standstill, stuck while Jordan works to shore up support from Republican colleagues to replace the ousted Kevin McCarthy for the job. Reluctant Republicans are refusing to give Jordan their votes, viewing the Ohio congressman as too extreme for the powerful position of House speaker, second in line to the presidency. Next votes were expected Wednesday.\n\n\"We're going to keep working,\" Jordan said at the Capitol as evening fell.\n\nIt's been two weeks of angry Republican infighting since McCarthy's sudden removal by hard-liners, who are now within reach of a central seat of U.S. power. The vote for House speaker, once a formality in Congress, has devolved into another bitter showdown for the gavel .\n\nJordan said after the first vote that he was not surprised and expected to do better in the next round. But the afternoon dragged on with no further votes Tuesday. \"We feel confident,\" he said, ducking into a leadership office.\n\nThe tally, with 200 Republicans voting for Jordan and 212 for the Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York, left no candidate with a clear majority, as 20 Republicans voted for someone else. With Republicans in majority control, Jordan must pick up most of his GOP foes to win.\n\nThe holdouts are a mix of pragmatists, ranging from seasoned legislators and committee chairs worried about governing, to newer lawmakers from districts where voters back home prefer President Joe Biden to Trump.\n\nBut with public pressure bearing down on lawmakers from Trump's allies, including Fox News Channel's Sean Hannity, it's unclear how long the holdouts can last. Jordan swiftly flipped dozens of detractors in a matter of days, shoring up Republicans who have few options left, but it was not enough.\n\n\"Jim Jordan will be a great speaker,\" the former president said outside a courthouse in Manhattan, where he is facing business fraud charges . \"I think he's going to have the votes soon, if not today, over the next day or two.\"\n\nThe political climb has been steep for Jordan, the combative Judiciary Committee chairman and a founding member of the right-flank Freedom Caucus. He is known more as a chaos agent than a skilled legislator, raising questions about how he would lead. Congress faces daunting challenges, risking a federal shutdown at home if it fails to fund the government and fielding Biden's requests for aid to help Ukraine and Israel in the wars abroad.\n\nWith the House Republican majority narrowly held at 221-212, Jordan can afford to lose only a few votes to reach the 217 majority threshold, if there are no further absences.\n\nJeffries swiftly intervened, declaring was time for Republicans to partner with Democrats to reopen the House.\n\nBipartisan groups of lawmakers have been floating ways to operate the House by giving greater power to the interim speaker, Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., or another temporary speaker.\n\n\"The Republicans are unable to function right now,\" said Jeffries. He said talks \"would accelerate\" between Democrats and Republicans into the evening.\n\nAs the somber roll call was underway, each lawmaker announcing their choice, the holdouts quickly surfaced.\n\nRep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., a leader of the centrists, voted for McCarthy, the ousted former speaker. Murmurs rippled through the chamber. Others voted for Majority Leader Steve Scalise, who was the party's first nominee to replace McCarthy before he, too, was rejected by hardliners last week.\n\nMaking the official nominating speech was another top Trump ally, GOP conference chairwoman Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, who declared Jordan will be \"we the people's speaker.\"\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, Democratic caucus chairman Rep. Pete Aguilar of California nominated Jeffries and warned that handing the speaker's gavel to a \"vocal election denier\" would send \"a terrible message\" at home and abroad.\n\nAguilar recited all the times Jordan voted against various measures -- abortion access, government aid and others. Democrats chanted, \"He said no!\"\n\nUpset that a small band of hard-liners have upended the House by ousting McCarthy, Republicans have watched their majority control of the chamber descend into public infighting. All House business has ground to a halt.\n\nOne holdout, Republican Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado, said Jordan's role in the runup to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol and his refusal to admit that Biden, a Democrat, won the 2020 election remained an issue.\n\n\"Jim, at some point, if he's going to lead this conference during the presidential election cycle and particularly in a presidential election year ... is going to have to be strong and say Donald Trump didn't win the election and we need to move forward,\" Buck said.\n\nImmediately after the vote, Jordan conferred with McCarthy, who fared nearly as badly in January, having lost almost as many votes on the first of what would become a historic 15 ballots for the gavel .\n\nJordan can rely on Trump's support as well as pressure on colleagues from an army of grassroots activists who recognize him from cable news and fiery performances at committee hearings. Some Republicans said their first vote was merely a protest, and they would be with Jordan on future ballots.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who engineered McCarthy's ouster by a handful of hard-liners, which did not include Jordan, publicly praised each lawmaker who has flipped to Jordan's column - and berated those who have not.\n\nDemocrats have decried the far-right shift, calling Jordan the leader of the chaos wing of the GOP.\n\nJordan has been a top Trump ally, particularly during the Jan. 6 Capitol attack by the former president's backers who were trying to overturn the 2020 election he lost to Biden. Days later, Trump awarded Jordan a Medal of Freedom .\n\nNow the Republican Party's front-runner to challenge Biden in the 2024 election, Trump backed Jordan to replace McCarthy early on and worked against the nomination of Scalise, who withdrew after colleagues rejected their own rules and failed to coalesce around him.\n\nTensions remained high among Republicans exhausted by the internal party infighting.\n\nSome Republicans resent being pressured by Jordan's allies and say they are being threatened with primary opponents if they don't support him as speaker. Others are simply upset at the way the whole process has dragged out.\n\nFirst elected in 2006, Jordan has few bills to his name from his time in office. He also faces questions about his past. Some years ago, Jordan denied allegations from former wrestlers during his time as an assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University who accused him of knowing about claims they were inappropriately groped by an Ohio doctor. Jordan has said he was never aware of any abuse.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Kevin Freking and Mary Clare Jalonick contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Jim Jordan Could Have a Long Fight Ahead\n\nAfter losing his first speakership vote on the House floor, Jordan finds himself in the same position that Kevin McCarthy was in at the start of the year.\n\nUpdated at 3:46 p.m. ET on October 17, 2023\n\nOn Friday, immediately after nominating Representative Jim Jordan as their latest candidate for speaker, House Republicans took a second, secret-ballot vote. The question put to each lawmaker was simple: Would you support Jordan in a public vote on the House floor?\n\nThe results were not encouraging for the pugnacious Ohioan. Nearly a quarter of the House Republican conference-55 members-said they would not back Jordan. Given the GOP's threadbare majority, he could afford to lose no more than three Republicans on the vote. Jordan's bid seemed to be fizzling even faster than that of Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, whose nomination earlier in the week lasted barely a day before he bowed out in the face of opposition from within the party.\n\nYet, by this afternoon, Jordan had flipped dozens of holdouts to put himself closer to winning the speakership. The 55 Republicans who said last week that they wouldn't support him had dwindled to 20 when the House voted this afternoon. He earned a total of 200 votes on the floor; he'll need 217 to win. Jordan will now try to replicate the strategy that former Speaker Kevin McCarthy used to capture the top House post in January: wearing down his opposition, vote by painful vote. It took McCarthy 15 ballots to secure the speakership, but Jordan may not need that many. The Republicans who voted against him on the floor have not displayed the defiance that characterized the conservatives who overthrew McCarthy. Several of them have told reporters that they could be persuaded to vote for Jordan, or would not stand in the way if he neared the threshold of 217 votes needed to win.\n\nRead: Steve Scalise bows out\n\nShould he secure those final votes, Jordan's election would represent a major victory for the GOP hardliners who, led by Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida, toppled McCarthy with the hope of replacing him with a more combative, ideological conservative. The switch would also give Donald Trump, who endorsed Jordan, something he's never had in his seven years as the Republican Party's official and unofficial standard-bearer: a House speaker fully committed to his cause. Although McCarthy and the previous GOP speaker, Paul Ryan, accommodated the former president, Jordan has been his champion; as documented by the House committee on January 6, Jordan was deeply involved in Trump's effort to overturn the 2020 election and urged then-Vice President Mike Pence to throw out electoral votes from states that Trump was contesting.\n\nHis election would look a lot like Trump's, each the result of establishment Republicans falling in line with a leader many of them swore they'd never support. Throughout Trump's four years in the White House, GOP lawmakers, aides, and even members of the Cabinet sharply criticized the president in private, either to reporters or to their own colleagues, while offering unequivocal support and praise in public. That dynamic played out for Jordan this afternoon, when the floor vote revealed that dozens of the Republicans who'd opposed him in a secret ballot were unwilling to put their names against him on the record.\n\nSome of them had made awkward public reversals in the run-up to the vote. On Thursday, Representative Ann Wagner of Missouri was asked whether she would back Jordan in a floor vote. \"HELL NO,\" she told Scott Wong of NBC News. By Monday morning, she was saying that Jordan had \"allayed my concerns about keeping the government open\" and securing the southern border; she would vote for him. One by one, other senior Republicans who had initially said that they were determined to block Jordan's ascent-Representatives Mike Rogers of Alabama, Ken Calvert of California, Vern Buchanan of Florida among them-declared that they, too, had come around.\n\nBy this afternoon, however, Jordan was still well short of the votes he needed. \"I was surprised at the number. I think everyone was surprised,\" Representative Byron Donalds of Florida, a Jordan supporter, told reporters after the vote. The big question now is whether Jordan can close the gap on subsequent ballots, or whether the small cadre of Republican holdouts will grow into a more formidable bloc against his candidacy. The safer assumption seemed to be that Jordan's opposition would melt away. After all, this group of Republicans is a different breed than the recalcitrant conservatives who forced out McCarthy. The anti-Jordan contingent is, if not ideologically moderate, then far more pragmatic and committed to stable governance than the anti-McCarthy faction.\n\nThe lack of a House speaker for the past two weeks has paralyzed the chamber in the middle of ballooning domestic and international crises. The federal government will shut down a month from today if no action is taken by Congress, which has been unable to offer more assistance to either Israel or Ukraine in their respective wars with Hamas and Russia. A number of Jordan skeptics have cited the upheaval outside the Capitol as a rationale for resolving the impasse inside the dome, even if it means voting for a conservative they consider ill-suited to lead.\n\nLee Drutman: Matt Gaetz is half right\n\nDemocrats believed that the election of such a polarizing Republican could, along with the general collapse of governance by the GOP, help them recapture the chamber next year. But they were appalled that Republicans might elevate to the speakership a far-right ideologue many of them have labeled an insurrectionist. A former wrestler who brought a fighter's mentality to Congress, Jordan rose to prominence as an antagonist of former Republican Speaker John Boehner a decade ago, pushing against bipartisan cooperation. \"He is the worst possible choice,\" Representative Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, a 25-year veteran of the House, told me before the vote.\n\nJordan's record, and the possibility that he would be an electoral vulnerability for the GOP, was clearly weighing on Republicans before the vote. As he walked into the chamber shortly after noon, Representative Anthony D'Esposito, a Republican who represents a swing district on Long Island, told reporters that he still hadn't decided how to vote. He ultimately joined 19 other GOP lawmakers in backing someone other than Jordan. Other mainstream Republicans justified their vote for Jordan on the grounds that he alone had the credibility to persuade far-right Republicans to avert a government shutdown in the coming weeks and months. \"If he says it, they think it's a strategic move. If I say it, they call me a RINO,\" one Republican told me on the condition of anonymity after voting for Jordan.\n\nBy the end of the vote, as many Republicans had opposed Jordan as had initially tried to block McCarthy in January, before the former speaker embarked on a five-day period of private lobbying and dealmaking to win the gavel. It was unclear whether Jordan would be able to do the same. He appeared relaxed as he sat through the nearly hour-long roll call, showing little reaction as his defections mounted. When the vote ended, he huddled with supporters, including McCarthy, and the House, having failed once more to elect a speaker, recessed so Republicans could figure out their next move."

      "text": "Newt Gingrich's Degraded Legacy\n\nGingrich had a vision of what America ought to be about. But his successors seem dour and unimaginative in their pugnacity.\n\nKevin McCarthy lost his job as speaker of the House because eight of his fellow Republican representatives decided he was insufficiently willing to fight. They believed that he lacked the stomach to use the debt ceiling or the potential of a government shutdown to extract serious concessions from the Democratic Senate and President Joe Biden. And now, nearly two weeks after they ousted McCarthy, Republicans still can't settle on a replacement. Quite a few of the most combative members insisted they would back only Representative Jim Jordan on the floor, including Representative Lauren Boebert, who told reporters, \"I'm ready for somebody who's gonna throw down and not care who's in the way.\"\n\nBoebert's bellicosity reflects a deep strand of the modern congressional Republican self-image, stamped on the party three decades ago by then-Speaker Newt Gingrich. Gingrich brought House Republicans out of 40 years in the political wilderness and into the majority, and he did it by being a prophetic champion of confrontation. From his first congressional race in 1974 all the way through the end of his speakership in 1998, Gingrich was motivated by the belief that confrontation had the power to rescue Americans from their corrupted politics. There was an art, a choreography to this sort of redemptive combativeness, Gingrich thought: \"When you give them confrontations, you get attention; when you get attention, you can educate.\" If they could make their case to the American people, Republicans could stop taking breadcrumbs from the Democrats' table and take over the banquet hall themselves-and run it better.\n\nRead: Steve Scalise bows out\n\nThe GOP's return to the majority came after the 1994 midterms. By now, Gingrich's catechism of confrontation has become an embedded tradition among House Republicans. But as it has been passed down, it has become hollowed out and fetishized. Gingrich's clashes were in service of a party and a positive program. His descendants often seem to want confrontation for its own sake, even as it is ripping their party asunder and pushing policy away from their preferences. If House Republicans want to find their way back to being a functional party-and that is not a given-they will have to master their urge to fight.\n\nThe question of just what kinds of confrontations are worth pursuing was at the heart of the fight last week between Jordan and Representative Steve Scalise, the majority leader and logical next man up. In a secret ballot, the conference narrowly supported Scalise, 113-99, showing that the GOP is genuinely split on the point. That neither Scalise nor Jordan could hope to take a winning vote and automatically turn it into a viable speakership shows that the divide may have become unbridgeable.\n\nBriefly considering the two men's congressional careers helps illuminate what each side is about.\n\nScalise first came to the House after winning a special election in 2008. Although his policy preferences are quite conservative, he has a transactional sensibility and has been a consistent supporter of yearly spending deals. He is someone who likes to dole out trinkets to his colleagues and generally wants to be well liked. Having been nearly assassinated by a left-wing political extremist in 2017, he has sometimes been an eloquent exponent of across-the-aisle goodwill; his return to Congress after recovering from his wounds was one of the few feel-good moments in the House's past decade.\n\nJordan is the walking embodiment of conflict-mindedness. First elected to the House in 2006, just as Republicans returned to the minority, he made a name for himself as a critic of government spending and bailouts (not sparing President George W. Bush from his ire), pushing pro-life ideas and hammering several of Barack Obama's Cabinet members. Jordan's conception of a lawmaker's role has never laid much emphasis on making laws . He relishes representation for its own sake; in 2011, he explained why he planned to remain in the House rather than challenge Sherrod Brown for a spot in the Senate: \"I like that you are here to fight for things you told the voters you are going to fight for.\" For Jordan, an accomplished wrestler as a young man, that means waging a relentless rhetorical struggle against the powers that be. The negative is far more important than the positive.\n\nAfter the Republicans' midterm wave in 2010, Jordan's relentlessness helped get him elected as head of the Republican Study Committee, traditionally a bastion of conservatism in the House. Before long, however, Jordan and many of the most combative members of the GOP conference came to feel that the RSC was no longer conservative enough; specifically, it was too large to provide the cohesiveness needed to take a hard line in negotiations with Republican legislative leaders looking to compromise. To play that role, Jordan and like-minded colleagues including Mark Meadows, Mick Mulvaney, and Ron DeSantis founded the House Freedom Caucus (HFC) after the 2014 midterms. When Speaker John Boehner proved too willing to come to terms with Obama in September 2015, the HFC hounded him into retirement. (Meanwhile, following Jordan's departure from the Study Committee, its next head was Scalise, who would go on to parlay that job into a successful run for minority whip after Majority Leader Eric Cantor was unexpectedly defeated by an outsider primary challenge in 2014.)\n\nRead: 'We put sharp knives in the hands of children'\n\nThe HFC also learned to harmonize with Donald Trump, the outsider critic of the establishment then taking its party by storm. The legislators' initial relationship with Trump was tense, because many preferred Senator Ted Cruz and suspected Trump of being a squish. But as the sharp-elbowed New Yorker gained momentum, HFC members switched horses with real agility. Trump rewarded them by making Mulvaney the head of the powerful Office of Management and Budget. The peak of HFC cooperativeness came in pursuit of tax reform in the fall of 2017.\n\nAfter that, the group's pugnaciousness came back to the fore. Speaker Paul Ryan gave its members hearings but lacked their desired killer instinct in dealing with Nancy Pelosi's Democrats as they went after Trump. The president soon absorbed their sense of embattlement and took them on as confidants; Meadows would become his chief of staff. Jordan, especially, pushed Trump into open conflict with the lame-duck Republican Congress in December 2018 over the question of border funding. Faced with a veto threat from a president who would not accept a clean continuing resolution, the House and Senate never came close to getting on the same page and left the new Congress (including the first Democratic House in eight years) to deal with a partial government shutdown that would eventually last a record 35 days. Trump, who had said he would be \"proud\" to shut down the government in pursuit of border-security funds, eventually decided to accept Democrats' legislative terms while simultaneously acting to circumvent Congress by means of a dubious declaration of national emergency on the southern border, which allowed him to repurpose some funds. Jordan, unsurprisingly, said he supported the president's move \"100 percent.\" Confrontation comes first.\n\nWhen House Republicans have been in the minority, keeping their factions aligned has been a manageable task. All can turn their aggressive energies against Democrats, and those with more inclination toward cutting deals to keep government working can sign onto bipartisan agreements crafted by Democratic leaders. Activists may denounce these members as RINOs-Republicans in Name Only-but among members these tensions are manageable.\n\nWhen Republicans have held the House majority in the post-Tea Party era, however, the tension between the confrontation-minded and the establishment has been radioactive-containable for a time, but ultimately giving rise to fissures. Leading the Republican House is a truly nightmarish job. Boehner lasted nearly five years, which now seems remarkable. Paul Ryan lasted three; Kevin McCarthy, just 270 days. As someone joked , the half-life of Republican Speakers may soon be measured in hours.\n\nGingrich's own speakership gave foreshadowings of this revolution-eating-its-own-children dynamic. His conference in 1995, which included 73 mostly very enthusiastic freshmen, fed on his promises of transforming the federal government through dramatic showdowns. As they teed up an incredibly broad and ambitious slate of bills, Republican legislators sometimes talked as if the American people had elected Gingrich prime minister, with Bill Clinton's presence in the White House regarded as a sort of unfortunate hitch caused by Ross Perot's 1992 run. Republicans, and their speaker, soon learned how little Congress resembles a Westminster Parliament, though. They frequently misjudged what House Republicans were willing to vote for and were even more mystified by their Senate counterparts, who had not gotten the memo about the need for a thoroughgoing revolution. They poured much of their energy into a series of skirmishes over federal spending, expecting Congress's power of the purse to carry the day. Clinton frustrated their ambitions at every turn, vetoing bills but still blaming two successive government shutdowns on congressional Republicans. The prophet of confrontations ironically ended up playing the role of conciliator, begging his own members to accept less than half a loaf in return for reopening the government.\n\nGingrich had taken his career-long pitch against the corrupt Washington establishment and transformed it into an agenda for cutting government. He had forced that transformation onto the congressional agenda and managed to push it through the House. But he showed little ability to bring along all the factions within his own party, let alone the Democratic president. His battles with the president gave him ample opportunity to \"educate\" the American people, but he lacked realistic endgame strategies for dealing with those who remained unpersuaded. His post-shutdown speakership saw him seek out more performative kinds of fights, including a bad bet on impeaching Clinton, while simultaneously securing some important policy victories that fell well short of his promise to roll back the Great Society.\n\nFrom the November 2018 issue: The man who broke politics\n\nWould Jordan, or one of his HFC colleagues, follow Gingrich's trajectory if they ended up with the speakership? It is possible, but whereas Gingrich had an infectious vision of what America ought to be about and was bursting with ideas about how to fix up the government, his successors seem dour and unimaginative in their pugnacity. And whereas Gingrich was a committed Republican team builder, the HFC was in some sense created out of a sense that Republicans needed more internal strife. For Jordan, confrontation seems to be its own reward, and \"small government\" seems to be a slogan as much as a goal to be realized. The HFC's strategy of intransigent resistance to compromise tends to move ultimate policy outcomes to the left by forcing other Republicans to seek terms with Democrats, most analysts agree. Speaker Gingrich would not have approved-and Gingrich as elder statesman has been unsparing in his criticism of the HFC's tactics and unwillingness to rally behind McCarthy.\n\nThere remains, nevertheless, a grain of truth in the HFC's blanket criticism of the establishment. A remarkable portion of legislation that has emerged from Congress in the 21st century has been the result of deals cut by leaders of both parties, with committees and rank-and-file membership both relegated to acting as eleventh-hour ratifiers rather than real collaborators in the legislative process. Allowing more disputes to play out in the political arena, as Representative Matt Gaetz called for when he led the charge against McCarthy, would indeed be healthy for our democracy. But if that path is to ever favor conservatives, they will need to change their approach to conflict. They need to realize that, rather than just \"educating\" the public and hoping to sweep all opposition before them, to make the most of their roles as legislators they must turn their sights to their fellow representatives. Confrontation must be in service of persuasion, and win-win conciliation must be an ever-present possibility.\n\nThe deep logic of Congress and its place in our constitutional system ought to call Republican lawmakers in this direction. All the drama in 2023 could represent a first step down the path. But the road ahead is long."

      "text": "The Threat to Democracy Is Coming From Inside the U.S. House\n\nJim Jordan's advance to the brink of the speakership extends the pattern that has played out within the GOP since Donald Trump became a national candidate.\n\nRepresentative Jim Jordan may or may not break down the last few Republican holdouts who blocked his election as House speaker yesterday. But the fact that about 90 percent of the House GOP conference voted to place him in the chamber's top job marks an ominous milestone in the Republican Party's reconfiguration since Donald Trump's emergence as its central figure.\n\nThe preponderant majority of House Republicans backing Jordan is attempting to elevate someone who not only defended former President Trump's efforts to subvert the 2020 presidential election but participated in them more extensively than any other member of Congress, according to the bipartisan committee that investigated the January 6 insurrection. As former Republican Representative Liz Cheney, who was the vice chair of that committee, said earlier this month : \"Jim Jordan knew more about what Donald Trump had planned for January 6 than any other member of the House of Representatives.\"\n\nRead: Jim Jordan could have a long fight ahead\n\nJordan's rise, like Trump's own commanding lead in the 2024 GOP presidential race, provides more evidence that for the first time since the Civil War, the dominant faction in one of America's two major parties is no longer committed to the principles of democracy as the U.S. has known them. That means the nation now faces the possibility of sustained threats to the tradition of free and fair elections, with Trump's own antidemocratic tendencies not only tolerated but amplified by his allies across the party.\n\nIan Bassin, the executive director of the bipartisan group Protect Democracy, told me that the American constitutional system \"is not built to withstand\" a demagogue capturing \"an entire political party\" and installing \"his loyalists in key positions in the other branches of government.\" That dynamic, he told me, \"would likely mean our 247-year-old republic won't live to celebrate 250.\" And yet, he continued, \"those developments are precisely what we're witnessing play out before our eyes.\"\n\nSarah Longwell, the founder of the anti-Trump Republican Accountability Project, told me that whether or not Jordan steamrolls the last holdouts, his strength in the race reflects the position inside the party of the forces allied with Trump. \"Even if he doesn't make it, because the majorities are so slim, you can't argue that Jim Jordan doesn't represent the median Republican today,\" she told me.\n\nLongwell said House Republicans have sent an especially clear signal by predominantly rallying around Jordan, who actively enlisted in Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election, so soon after they exiled Cheney, who denounced them and then was soundly defeated in a GOP primary last year. \"Nominating Jim Jordan to be speaker is not them acquiescing to antidemocratic forces; it is them fully embracing antidemocratic forces,\" she said. \"The contrast between Jim Jordan potentially ascending to speaker and Liz Cheney, who is out of the Republican Party and excommunicated, could not be a starker statement of what the party stands for.\"\n\nIn one sense, Jordan's advance to the brink of the speakership only extends the pattern that has played out within the GOP since Trump became a national candidate in 2015. Each time the party has had an opportunity to distance itself from Trump, it has roared past the exit ramp and reaffirmed its commitment. At each moment of crisis for him, the handful of Republicans who condemned his behavior were swamped by his fervid supporters until resistance in the party crumbled.\n\nEven against that backdrop, the breadth of Republican support for Jordan as speaker is still a striking statement. As the January 6 committee's final report showed , Jordan participated in virtually every element of Trump's campaign to subvert the 2020 result. Jordan spoke at \"Stop the Steal\" rallies, spread baseless conspiracy theories through television appearances and social media, urged Trump not to concede, demanded congressional investigations into nonexistent election fraud, and participated in multiple White House strategy sessions on how to pressure Vice President Mike Pence to reject the results.\n\nGiven that record, \"'undermining the election' is too soft a language\" to describe Jordan's activities in 2020, Jena Griswold, Colorado's Democratic secretary of state, told me. \"He was involved in every step to try to destroy American democracy and the peaceful transfer of the presidency.\" If Jordan wins the position, she said, \"you could no longer count on the speaker of the House to defend the United States Constitution.\"\n\nJordan didn't stop his service to Trump once he left office. Since the GOP won control of the House last year, Jordan has used his role as chair of the House Judiciary Committee to launch investigations into each of the prosecutors who have indicted Trump on criminal charges (local district attorneys in Manhattan and Fulton County, Georgia, as well as federal Special Counsel Jack Smith). Fani Willis, the Fulton County district attorney, has described Jordan's demand for information as an effort \"to obstruct a Georgia criminal proceeding\" that is \"flagrantly at odds with the Constitution.\"\n\nThe willingness of most GOP House members to embrace Jordan as speaker, even as he offers such unconditional support to Trump, sends the same message about the party's balance of power as the former president's own dominant position in the 2024 Republican race. Though some Republican voters clearly remain resistant to nominating Trump again, his support in national surveys usually exceeds the total vote for all of his rivals combined.\n\nEqually telling is that rather than criticizing Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election, almost all of his rivals have echoed his claim that the indictments he's facing over his actions are unfair and politically motivated. In the same vein, hardly any of the Republican members resisting Jordan have even remotely suggested that his role in Trump's attempts to subvert the election is a legitimate reason to oppose him. That silence from Jordan's critics speaks loudly to the reluctance in all corners of the GOP to cross Trump.\n\n\"If Jordan becomes speaker, it would really mean the complete and total takeover of the party by Trump,\" former Republican Representative Charlie Dent, now the executive director of the Aspen Institute's congressional program, told me. \"Because he is the closest thing Trump has to a wingman in Congress.\"\n\nAll of this crystallizes the growing tendency at every level of the GOP, encompassing voters and activists as well as donors and elected officials, to normalize and whitewash Trump's effort to overturn the 2020 election. In an Economist /YouGov national poll earlier this year , fully three-fifths of Trump 2020 voters said those who stormed the Capitol on January 6 were participating \"in legitimate political discourse,\" and only about one-fifth said they were part of a violent insurrection. Only about one-fifth of Trump 2020 voters thought he bore a significant share of responsibility for the January 6 attack; more than seven in 10 thought he carried little or no responsibility.\n\nThat sentiment has solidified in the GOP partly because of a self-reinforcing cycle, Longwell believes. Because most Republican voters do not believe that Trump acted inappropriately after 2020, she said, candidates can't win a primary by denouncing him, but because so few elected officials criticize his actions, \"the more normal elements of the party become convinced it's not an issue or it's not worth objecting to.\"\n\nThe flip side is that for the minority of House Republicans in highly competitive districts-18 in seats that voted for President Joe Biden in 2020 and another 15 or so in districts that only narrowly preferred Trump-Jordan could be a heavy burden to carry as speaker. \"Everyone is worried about their primary opponents, but in this case ameliorating the primary pressures by endorsing Jordan could spell political death in the general election in a competitive district,\" Dent told me. Even so, 12 of the 18 House Republicans in districts that Biden carried voted for Jordan on his first ballot as a measure of their reluctance to challenge the party's MAGA forces.\n\nThe instinct for self-preservation among a handful of Republican members combined with ongoing resentment at the role of the far right in ousting Kevin McCarthy might be enough to keep Jordan just below the majority he needs for election as speaker; many Republicans expect him to fail again in a second vote scheduled for this morning. Yet even if Jordan falls short, it's his ascent that captures the shift in the party's balance of power toward Trump's MAGA movement.\n\nBassin, of Protect Democracy, points to a disturbing analogy for what is happening in the GOP as Trump surges and Jordan climbs. \"When you look at the historical case studies to determine which countries survive autocratic challenges and which succumb to them,\" Bassin told me, a key determinant is \"whether the country's mainstream parties unite with their traditional opponents to block the extremists from power.\"\n\nPhilip Wallach: Newt Gingrich's degraded legacy\n\nOver the years, he said, that kind of alliance has mobilized against autocratic movements in countries including the Czech Republic, France, Finland, and, most recently, Poland, where the center-right joined with its opponents on the left to topple the antidemocratic Law and Justice party . The chilling counterexample, Bassin noted, is that during the period between World War I and World War II, \"center-right parties in Germany and Italy chose a different course.\" Rather than directly opposing the emerging fascist movements in each country, they opted \"instead to try to ride the energy of [the] far-right extremists to power, thinking that once there, they could easily sideline [their] leaders.\"\n\nThat was, of course, a historic miscalculation that led to the destruction of democracy in each country. But, Bassin said, \"right now, terrifyingly, the American Republican Party is following the German and Italian path.\" The belligerent Jordan may face just enough personal and ideological opposition to stop him, but whether or not he becomes speaker, his rise captures the currents carrying the Trump-era GOP ever further from America's democratic traditions."

      "text": "Mike Pompeo and Jim Jordan's Astounding Hypocrisy\n\nWhen we were investigating Benghazi, we would have moved to impeach if armed with such clear evidence.\n\nFor eight years, House Republicans searched for a \"smoking gun\" that could unravel the presidency of Barack Obama. They presided over hundreds of oversight hearings , issued more than 100 subpoenas , held the attorney general in contempt of Congress, and even formed a special select committee devoted exclusively to one investigation, on Benghazi. As someone who spent five years working alongside Republicans on the Oversight Committee, I can tell you that we never found a \"smoking gun\" like the testimony that was provided yesterday from the senior U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, William B. Taylor.\n\nAmbassador Taylor delivered a 15-page opening statement that detailed the \"confusing and unusual arrangement\" involving the nongovernment employee Rudy Giuliani's \"irregular\" role in making aid to Ukraine conditioned on the promise to investigate the family of one of President Donald Trump's political rivals, Joe Biden. Taylor testified that Acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney had ordered an Office of Management and Budget staff member to \"hold security assistance to Ukraine,\" even though the Defense Department had determined that the \"assistance was effective and should be resumed.\"\n\nTaylor also testified that Ambassador Gordon Sondland told him that \"President Trump had told him that he wants President [Volodymyr] Zelensky to state publicly that Ukraine will investigate Burisma [the company on whose board Hunter Biden sat] and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 U.S. election.\" Taylor further said that following Trump's September 7 phone call with President Zelensky, a National Security Council aide told him that Trump insisted that \"President Zelensky go to a microphone and say he is opening investigations of Biden and 2016 election interference.\"\n\nAs I read through Taylor's statement, which was given under oath, I couldn't help but think to myself how my former Republican colleagues would have reacted if similar testimony had been given by a career diplomat during the Obama administration, especially during the Benghazi investigation, which produced 33 hearings in two years.\n\nIn June 2016, Representatives Jim Jordan and Mike Pompeo-yes, the same Jim Jordan who is now the ranking member of the House Oversight Committee and the same Mike Pompeo who is now the secretary of state- declared that \"it is our belief that many of [the Benghazi] failures were the result of the administration's obsession with preserving a political narrative.\"\n\nRead: What Benghazi truthers are looking for\n\nThe reality is that if Pompeo, Jordan, and House Republicans had received the kind of bombshell testimony we heard from Taylor yesterday, they would have immediately moved to impeach the president.\n\nIn a blatant display of hypocrisy, Pompeo has refused to cooperate with Congress's impeachment investigation and has blocked other State Department officials from testifying. Jordan has spent his time attacking the impeachment proceedings, bizarrely suggesting that the Democrats have something to hide .\n\nOf course, when they were investigating Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, Pompeo and Jordan made \"note of the disappointing fact that the administration did not cooperate with our committee's investigation from the very beginning. In fact, they obstructed our work from day one.\"\n\nDuring the Obama years, obstruction of Congress was a great concern among House Republicans, many of whom have become Trump's chief public defenders. Representative Doug Collins is the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee, but when he was a member of the Oversight Committee in 2014, he defended congressional investigations as being \"not about partisan politics, it's not about witch hunts, this is about the people.\"\n\nAnother one of Trump's fiercest defenders, Representative Mark Meadows, was singing a very different tune in 2014, when Republicans opened a barrage of investigations targeting the Obama administration in the run-up to the midterm elections, by saying , \"Really what most Americans want is that justice is served.\"\n\nFive years later, a top diplomat was testifying that the president saw aid to Ukraine as a mechanism to extract a promise from a foreign leader to investigate one of his top political opponents. The acting head of the Office of Management and Budget is refusing to testify about why the White House chief of staff blocked the release of the aid. And Pompeo, Jordan, Meadows, and Collins aren't saying a word about obstructing Congress. They aren't on cable news defending our constitutionally protected system of checks and balances. They aren't demanding that members of the executive branch who ignore Congress's oversight authority be held in contempt. They aren't calling for the creation of a special select committee to investigate aid to Ukraine. Instead, they are burying their heads in the sand, hoping to avoid the smoke."

      "text": "We Wouldn't Have Let Obama Get Away With This\n\nI worked for Republicans on the House Oversight Committee back when the GOP cared about keeping the president in check.\n\nPresident Donald Trump last Tuesday lamented on Twitter that \"in the 'old days' if you were President and you had a good economy, you were basically immune from criticism.\" The next day, he complained that Congress members \"only want to continue the Witch Hunt, which I have already won.\" In an interview with The Washington Post, Trump said , \"There is no reason to go any further, and especially in Congress where it's very partisan-obviously very partisan ... I don't want people testifying to a party, because that is what they're doing if they do this.\" Meanwhile, Trump has filed a lawsuit to avoid handing over his tax returns to the House.\n\nTrump's defiance of Congress is outrageous and dangerous. It also exposes Republicans' hypocrisy. There is a world of difference between how Republicans viewed oversight when Barack Obama was president and their support of Trump's obstruction. I know, because for five years I worked for Republicans on the House Oversight and Reform Committee.\n\nIn a 1957 Supreme Court ruling, Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote, \"The power of Congress to conduct investigations is inherent in the legislative process. That power is broad ... It comprehends probes into departments of the federal government to expose corruption, inefficiency, or waste.\"\n\nDavid A. Graham: Trump is now in open defiance of Congress\n\nDuring my time on Oversight, the chief justice's words were often cited as justification for our vigorous supervision of the Obama administration. Led by Representative Darrell Issa, my former boss, Republicans issued more than 100 subpoenas , held Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress , created a select committee to investigate Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's handling of the Benghazi crisis, and filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging President Obama's use of executive privilege.\n\nIn 2011, we sent a letter to Secretary Clinton that stated: \"The Committee on Oversight and Government Reform is the principal oversight committee of the House of Representatives and may at 'any time' investigate 'any matter' as set forth in House Rule X.\"\n\nAlso in 2011, when we suspected an effort to intimidate a witness called to testify at a hearing, Issa sent a letter warning the Obama administration that the \"inappropriate effort to intimidate\" and \"discourage\" someone from testifying before Congress was \"an unlawful attempt to interfere with a Congressional inquiry.\"\n\nYet when Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin last week ignored a deadline to produce Trump's tax returns, House Republicans refused to speak out against this blatant disregard for legislative authority.\n\nAnd Republicans did nothing when the White House last week instructed an administration official to ignore a subpoena and not testify at a hearing regarding White House security-clearance procedures.\n\nPaul Rosenzweig: Republicans used to care about obstruction of justice\n\nContrast that with the time an IRS official refused to answer questions from Oversight Republicans-they held that official in contempt of Congress. During the contempt proceeding, Representative Jim Jordan, now the ranking Republican on the Oversight Committee, justified his vote in favor of contempt by saying, \"The only remedy we have to get to the truth is to use every tool at our disposal\" to get that official to \"testify and answer the questions. That is the only remedy we have. The only route to the truth is through the House of Representatives.\"\n\nPresident Trump and Republicans complain about the pace of oversight; Trump declared on Twitter on Wednesday that \"there has NEVER been a President who has been more transparent.\" But the simple truth is that this White House is more obstructionist than the Obama White House, or any other White House, and Republicans are enabling this behavior.\n\nDuring the two years that Trump's presidency overlapped with the Republican majority in the House, Republicans issued a total of zero subpoenas to the Trump administration. To date, Trump has refused to cooperate with subpoenas issued by congressional Democrats.\n\nTrump's desire to shield his tax returns may provoke a constitutional standoff with Congress. He wants to slow the pace of oversight as much as possible, which means a long and tedious legal battle that will likely be decided by the Supreme Court. Trump is betting that the American people simply do not care whether or not he cooperates with congressional investigations. He's betting that they do not have the attention span to follow a long court battle about constitutional authority. Trump believes that his stranglehold on the GOP is so tight that his flagrant disregard for checks and balances won't matter to the Republican base or Republican elected officials.\n\nHe might be right.\n\nThe entire point of having separate but equal branches of government was to create protections against the kind of tyranny and absolute rule that was common in Europe. If Trump can simply ignore Congress and act unilaterally without consequence, then he is America's first dictator.\n\nThis fight is bigger than one hearing or one investigation or one subpoena. It is a struggle to preserve the foundation of our republic. Republicans won't rise to the challenge. Which means it's up to Democrats to keep Trump in check, and to support the Constitution. They have to learn to confront Trump as aggressively as we confronted Obama."

      "text": "The House Mess Is What GOP Voters Wanted\n\nThis is chaos by choice, not by accident.\n\nThis is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.\n\nThe ongoing drama over electing a speaker of the House is not about governance. It's about giving Republican voters the drama-filled reality show they voted for and want to see-even at the expense of the country.\n\nFirst, here are four new stories from The Atlantic :\n\nWhat the Voters Wanted\n\nLike many Americans, I have been both fascinated and horrified by the inability of the Republican majority to elect a new speaker of the House. I admit to watching the votes like I'm rubbernecking at a car wreck, but perhaps that's not a good analogy, because I at least feel pity for the victims of a traffic accident. What's happening in the House is more like watching a group of obnoxious (and not very bright) hot-rodders playing chicken and smashing their cars into one another over and over.\n\nAs I watch all of this Republican infighting, I wonder, as I often do, about GOP voters. What is it that they think will happen if Jim Jordan becomes speaker? Jordan has been in Congress for 16 years, and he has almost nothing to show for it . He's never originated any successful legislation, never whipped votes, never accomplished anything except for appearing on Fox and serving up rancid red meat to his Ohio constituents and MAGA allies.\n\nAnd therefore, as speaker, he would ... what? Order up more impeachments, perhaps of Biden-administration officials ? Shut down the government? Pound the gavel and prattle on for hours in his never-take-a-breath style? (Jordan's the kind of guy who probably would have interrupted the Sermon on the Mount.) Perhaps from a position of greater power, he could more effectively assist Donald Trump in undermining yet another election in 2024.\n\nMaybe that's why Trump endorsed him for speaker.\n\nIs that what Republican voters really want? Apparently so; as my friend Sarah Longwell, the founder of the anti-Trump Republican Accountability Project, told my Atlantic colleague Ronald Brownstein, \"Even if he doesn't make it, because the majorities are so slim, you can't argue that Jim Jordan doesn't represent the median Republican today.\"\n\nAnd that is the part we tend to overlook when we're focused on the drama inside the Capitol: The disorder in the GOP caucus is not some accident or glitch triggered by a handful of reprobates, but rather a direct result of choices by voters. The House is a mess because enough Republican voters want it to be a mess.\n\nThis accusation might seem unfair: Jordan is just one member from a super-red (and blatantly gerrymandered ) district, and many of his Republican colleagues are furious about this humiliating bungle. But right-wing voters have shown no inclination to punish people such as Matt Gaetz and other political vandals; indeed, Gaetz and his like-minded colleagues are rapidly becoming folk heroes in the Republican Party.\n\nIt's not much consolation to recognize that the Republicans are now the party their voters want them to be. Their antics endanger us all, especially during multiple international crises when the United States needs to be unified and effective both at home and abroad. But to treat the GOP as merely dysfunctional is worse than a distraction; it is a fundamental error that offers the false hope that a mature and governing majority is somehow within reach, if only Jordan or Gaetz would get out of the way.\n\nThe real problem is that many Republican voters have now completely internalized the cynicism of Trump and the GOP opportunists around him, and they draw no connection between national politics and the ongoing health and security of the United States. These voters rely on everyone else (including those Americans they deride as the \"deep state\") to keep the country functioning. They vote for masters of performative nonsense, such as Jordan and Gaetz, who do nothing for the \"forgotten\" working families in the places that the MAGA movement claims have been left behind by the rest of us.\n\nThe twists and turns of the Trump years, in which many elected Republicans became big spenders, critics of law enforcement, and apologists for the Kremlin, illustrated that MAGA voters have almost no interest in anything like conservatism, or even in coherent policy. Instead, they want to indulge resentments and grievances that have little to do with government and everything to do with boredom and dissatisfaction in their own lives. A few years ago, I wrote a book about how such voters project that anger and sourness onto everything around them. Their ennui spurs their desire to see chaos, so they argue that the existing order needs to be shaken up, or burned down, or defunded.\n\nThey think this way because they have never had to live under a government that has actually been shaken up, burned down, or defunded. Jordan and his colleagues (who have made entire careers out of encouraging such nihilism) are poor leaders but good politicians. They deliver what their voters really want: show trials and passion plays, and, mostly, to see other people unsettled and angry. These citizens vote not for determined legislators with complicated plans-that stuff is just so boring-but for entertaining rogues who can liven up the Fox prime-time hours.\n\nYears ago , I thought that Republican voters would demand changes from the party if the GOP lost enough elections. But even losses don't seem to matter in a party that is clearly more comfortable with performance art centered on imaginary grievances than with actual governing. The shenanigans of the past two weeks might even cost the Republicans control of the House in the next election-that's one reason Jordan's colleagues are trying to stop him-but that political collapse might not matter to right-wing voters. They'll get another episode of their favorite show-and for them, maybe that's enough.\n\nRelated:\n\nToday's News\n\nDispatches\n\nExplore all of our newsletters here.\n\nEvening Read\n\nThe Con Man Who Became a True-Crime Writer\n\nBy Rachel Monroe\n\nLast April, I received an odd email from a man named Matthew Cox. \"I am an inmate at the Coleman Federal Correctional Complex in Florida,\" he wrote. \"I'm also a true crime writer.\" He had one year left on his sentence and was \"attempting to develop a body of work that will allow me to exit prison with a new career.\" He included a story about a fellow inmate who'd been ensnared in a complicated currency-trading scam, hoping that I'd write about it for The Atlantic .\n\n\"This is fascinating,\" I replied. I didn't mean the currency-trading scam, which was too procedural for my tastes, but Cox's own trajectory. He described himself as \"an infamous con man writing his fellow inmates' true crime stories while immersed in federal prison.\" I'd never had a possible subject pitch his own tale so aptly. I wasn't entirely sure that was a good thing.\n\nRead the full article.\n\nMore From The Atlantic\n\nCulture Break\n\nRead.

He was a mainstay of my childhood television days, and when I mentioned him on social media, I realized how many folks out there remember him as fondly as I do. He was a remarkable character actor (the other night, I saw him on both Mannix and Barney Miller ), and he even brought some gravitas as the president in Escape From the Planet of the Apes . Many of us of a certain age, however, remember his starring role in My World and Welcome to It , based on the humor and cartoons of James Thurber, which ran for only one season yet is still beloved by many.\n\nBut I will always have a soft spot for Windom because of two roles. One, famous among Star Trek nerds like me, was his 1967 turn as Commodore Matt Decker, the tormented Starfleet officer who loses his ship and crew to an alien doomsday machine . He was also the star of one of Night Gallery 's best stories, a 1971 segment titled \" They're Tearing Down Tim Riley's Bar ,\" about a man facing loss and nostalgia as he enters middle age. \"Tim Riley's Bar,\" written by Rod Serling, was a different kind of episode for Night Gallery , and it was nominated for an Emmy.\n\nMovie stars are great, but give me a solid character actor like Windom any day.\n\n- Tom\n\nKatherine Hu contributed to this newsletter.\n\nWhen you buy a book using a link in this newsletter, we receive a commission.

      "text": "Brett Kavanaugh, Jim Jordan, and the Fog of the Partisan\n\nIt's a slippery slope when weighty matters get dissolved into claims of bias and fakery.\n\nThis week, shortly after Donald Trump announced his nominee for the Supreme Court seat left vacant by the retirement of Anthony Kennedy, a joking hashtag began trending on Twitter. #BrettKavanaughScandals , building on his public introduction at the White House-\"For the past seven years, I have coached my daughter's basketball teams,\" Kavanaugh said; \"the girls on the team call me 'Coach K'\"-reveled in the notion of Kavanaugh as a family man and a man of faith and an all-around nice guy. A man, in other words, for whom real scandal would be unthinkable. \"Brett Kavanaugh,\" one entry went , \"agrees with the 5th dentist who advises AGAINST chewing Trident.\" And : \"Often wore robes to work. Even on casual Fridays.\" And : \"Claimed Ben Affleck was the most authentic Batman.\" And : \"When his daughters begged for Oreos, Kavanaugh bought them Creme Betweens thinking they'd never notice the difference.\"\n\nBrett Kavanaugh, dadjoke incarnate: It's a series of punchlines that doubles as political argument-a case made, tweet by lighthearted tweet, about the constitutional goodness of the man who has been selected to interpret the Constitution on behalf of all Americans. But there is another series of punchlines lurking in the main one-these at the expense of the American press. The jokes of #BrettKavanaughScandals soon expanded to include specific jabs at CNN, at newsrooms, at journalists in general. The reporters who have been investigating the background of Brett Kavanaugh, the jokes go-reporters who have been, the jokes further go, searching for scandals that are simply not there-are revealing their own silliness, and their own silly bias. The reporters, in this vision, are not reporting on Brett Kavanaugh, a man who stands to have an outsized impact on literal lives and deaths for decades come, because it is their job to do so. They're doing it because they are determined. They're doing it because they are voracious. They're doing it because they are partisan.\n\nThere was a similar dynamic at play when, this week, Jim Jordan, the Ohio congressman currently plagued with a scandal of a much less laughable variety-the accusation that he looked away from the reported sexual abuse of athletes when he was the assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State-mocked the people attempting to investigate his past. \"Now @CNN is contacting all 100+ of our former staff and interns asking for dirt on me,\" Jordan tweeted . \"Getting desperate! How can you ever trust such #fakenews ?\"\n\nFake scandals, #fakenews: Each treatment, on its own, is silly, to the point that either would seem unworthy of much attention. And yet: Each is very much worth paying attention to, precisely because of what the silliness masks: Each one works to destabilize the main thing at play-a lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court on the one hand, allegations of complicity in sexual abuse on the other-by shifting the focus to something else entirely. Something light. Something easy. Something relatable. Kavanaugh's car-pooling; Jordan's eye-rolling: Both take the weighty matters at hand and dissolve them into the familiar fog of politics and bias and fakery. The easy permissions of partisanship.\n\nHere are some of the things that Jim Jordan, founding member of the Freedom Caucus and rising star of the GOP, is alleged to have known about when he worked at Ohio State: a team doctor, Richard Strauss, allegedly groping the wrestlers in his care to the point of making them ejaculate . Voyeurs allegedly watching the wrestlers in saunas and showers. An overall atmosphere that doubled as, according to one accuser, a \" gauntlet of sexual deviancy .\" Not only did Jordan know, one of the wrestlers, Dunyasha Yetts, has claimed ; \"for God's sake, Strauss's locker was right next to Jordan's and Jordan even said he'd kill him if he tried anything with him.\"\n\nAnd, then, here are some of the ways that Jordan has answered that mix of accusations: by, on the one hand, attempting to make a distinction between formal allegations made against Strauss and the broader culture of abuse that the doctor is alleged to have created. \"Conversations in a locker room are a lot different than allegations of abuse or reported abuse to us,\" Jordan told Fox News, seeming to acknowledge that he did, indeed, have some awareness of that culture. He added: \"No one ever reported abuse to me.\"\n\nJordan-and the many fellow members of Congress who have spoken out on behalf of the man who has been suggested as a successor to Paul Ryan as House speaker-have also turned to that extremely familiar path when it comes to the public discussion of #MeToo stories. The politicians have done their own oppo research, this time against the accusers. Jordan has recently begun arguing that Mike DiSabato, the former wrestler who was the first to formally report abuse to Ohio State, has a \"vendetta\" against both Jordan's family and the university. \"He's out to get Ohio State,\" Jordan told Fox News .\n\nOther Republican lawmakers have been making similar arguments, eagerly publicizing-eagerly politicizing-news reports that have engaged in their own form of dirt-digging: dredging up the legal histories of the wrestlers who accused Jordan of complicity in an effort to suggest those accusers' bad faith. (Jordan noted, in his discussion of DiSabato's \"vendetta,\" that DiSabato had been recently arrested.)\n\nLouie Gohmert, Jordan's congressional colleague and his fellow member of the House Freedom Caucus, pointed out that the law firm that Ohio State hired to investigate the men's allegations of sexual abuse at the university, Perkins Coie, has also done legal work for the DNC, Hillary Clinton, and Barack Obama-and for Fusion GPS, the DC firm that commissioned the Steele dossier . As Gohmert put it in a statement: \"They were recently paid by Hillary Clinton and the DNC as a pass-through entity to hire Fusion GPS to concoct the salacious and unverified Russian dossier at the heart of the Clinton team's attempted take-down of President Trump.\" The whole thing, the Texas representative summed it up, \"doesn't pass the smell test.\"\n\nThe cumulative effect of all this, statement by statement and tweet by tweet and \"yes, but\" by \"yes, but,\" is to change the terms of the discussion at hand-until, eventually but suddenly, the conversation is no longer about Jim Jordan's alleged complicity, but rather about bias and conspiracy and, in short, the predictable playing of politics. The new information settles into the familiar old grooves. The personal outweighs the structural, and the small stuff triumphs over the big. Bias-an accusation, an atmosphere-trumps all. It's so much easier to talk about Brett Kavanaugh's car-pooling and basketball coaching than it is to talk about Brett Kavanaugh's record of jurisprudence. It's so much easier to talk about the supposed politics at play in the Jim Jordan story than it is to talk about the moralities. \"Getting desperate!\" Jim Jordan tweets, of reporters who are simply reporting on the man who would be Speaker. It's easy-too easy-to believe him."

      "text": "A Speaker Without Enemies-For Now\n\nMike Johnson's win was as sudden as it was improbable.\n\nWhen Representative Mike Johnson arrived in Congress in 2017, he received an important piece of advice from a fellow Louisianan, Representative Steve Scalise. \"Be careful about your early alliances that you make,\" Scalise told Johnson, as the younger Republican recalled in a C-SPAN interview that year. Avoid getting \"marginalized or labeled in any way.\"\n\nSix years later, Johnson has followed that advice all the way to the House speakership, reaching a post that is second in line to the presidency faster than any other lawmaker in modern congressional history. Staunchly conservative and closely aligned with former President Donald Trump, the 51-year-old former talk-radio host made few headlines and fewer enemies as he climbed the ranks of his party.\n\nWith a 220-209 House vote this afternoon, Johnson was able to forge a consensus that eluded three previous aspirants-including his own mentor, Scalise-to replace Kevin McCarthy. He earned unanimous support from Republican members, who stood and applauded when he clinched a majority of the chamber. His victory ends a weeks-long power struggle that immobilized the House as a war started in the Middle East and a government shutdown loomed.\n\nJohnson's win was as sudden as it was improbable. Early yesterday afternoon, he lost a secret-ballot vote to become the House GOP's third speaker nominee in as many weeks. But the winner of that tally, Representative Tom Emmer of Minnesota, faced immediate backlash from social conservatives and Trump allies over his support for same-sex marriage and his 2021 vote to certify Joe Biden's election as president. More than two dozen Republicans told Emmer that they would not support him in a public floor vote, putting him in the same perilous position as the previous GOP speaker nominee, Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio. While Emmer was trying to win them over, Trump denounced him as \"a globalist RINO.\" Emmer's nomination was dead after just four hours.\n\nDavid A. Graham: The House Republicans's new litmus test\n\nAs the fifth-ranking House GOP leader, Johnson was next in line. Late last night, he captured the nomination in the second round of balloting. His victory was far from unanimous, but rank-and-file Republicans who had initially voted against Johnson, apparently weary after weeks of infighting, decided to support him.\n\nJohnson's ascent is a product of both the GOP's ideological conformity and its ongoing loyalty to Trump. His record in the House is no more moderate than Jordan's, whose preference for antagonism over compromise turned off an ultimately decisive faction of the party. Both Johnson and Jordan served as chairs of the Republican Study Committee-the largest conservative bloc in the House-and played key roles in Trump's effort to overturn his defeat in 2020. Johnson enlisted Republican lawmakers to sign a legal brief urging the Supreme Court to allow state legislatures to effectively nullify the votes of their citizens. Despite Johnson's involvement, he won the support of at least one Republican, Representative Ken Buck of Colorado, who had refused to vote for Jordan, because the Ohioan didn't acknowledge the legitimacy of Biden's win.\n\nFor electorally vulnerable House Republicans, Johnson's relative anonymity was an asset. They rejected Jordan in large part because they feared that his notoriety and uncompromising style would play poorly in their districts. By contrast, Johnson, who heeded Scalise's advice to avoid being \"marginalized or labeled,\" comes across as mild-mannered and polite. He could be harder for Democrats to demonize. Johnson is so little known that operatives at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which sent out a flurry of statements criticizing each successive speaker nominee, were still combing through his record and listening to old recordings of his radio show this morning. \"Mike Johnson is Jim Jordan in a sports coat,\" a spokesperson, Viet Shelton, told me. \"Electing him as speaker would represent how the Republican conference has completely given in to the most extreme fringes of their party.\"\n\nThe next few weeks will test whether the inexperienced Johnson is in over his head, and just how far to the right Johnson is willing to push his party. \"You're going to see this group work like a well-oiled machine,\" Johnson, flanked by dozens of his GOP colleagues, assured reporters after securing the nomination last night. He'll have plenty of doubters. The new speaker will be leading the same five-vote majority that routinely rebuffed McCarthy, forcing him to rely on Democrats to pass high-stakes legislation.\n\nRead: The real-world consequences of the House speaker fight\n\nCongress faces a November 17 deadline to avoid a government shutdown-the result of a five-week extension in funding that ultimately cost McCarthy his job. Johnson has circulated a plan to Republicans that suggested he would support another stopgap measure, for either two or five months, to buy time for the House and Senate to negotiate full-year spending bills.\n\nHe'll also confront immediate pressure to act on the Biden administration's request for more than $100 billion in aid to Israel and Ukraine. Like Jordan, Johnson has supported aid for Israel but has opposed additional Ukraine funding. \"We stand with our ally Israel,\" Johnson said last night; he made no mention of Ukraine.\n\nIf the GOP holds on to its majority next year, Johnson would have a say in whether the House certifies the presidential winner in 2024. When a reporter asked him last night about his role in helping Trump try to overturn the 2020 election, the Republicans around him, unified and jubilant for the first time in weeks, started to jeer. A few members booed the buzzkill in the press corps. \"Shut up!\" yelled one lawmaker, Representative Virginia Foxx of North Carolina. Johnson, the conservative without enemies, merely shook his head and smiled. \"Next question,\" he replied. \"Next question.\""

      "text": "The House Republicans' Troubling New Litmus Test\n\nOnly election deniers need apply for speaker.\n\nUpdated on October 25 at 1:59 p.m. ET\n\nOne paradox of the current House Republican majority, and a sign of the deep cleavages within it, is that having sought to overturn the 2020 presidential election can be both disqualifying and essential to becoming speaker of the House.\n\nAfter Jim Jordan of Ohio's campaign to become speaker flamed out, The Washington Post reported that one reason some colleagues refused to vote for him was his vocal role in trying to prevent the inauguration of Joe Biden. Following Jordan's exit, nine Republicans announced bids for the role, seven of whom had voted not to certify the 2020 election.\n\nThe next GOP nominee, however, was Majority Whip Tom Emmer of Minnesota, who voted in favor of certifying the election. That vote-on a matter for which there was no evidence of fraud and no evidence of theft-helped doom Emmer, who withdrew without even seeing a floor vote. Former President Donald Trump, along with some allies, mobilized to block Emmer , citing his certification vote, criticism of Trump after the January 6 riot at the Capitol, and perceived weak defense of Trump amid his 91 felony charges.\n\nRead: The threat to democracy is coming from inside the U.S. House\n\nThe next man up was Mike Johnson of Louisiana, who actually managed to win the speakership in a vote this afternoon. His victory is in part a product of fatigue: Republicans understood how bad the failure to elect a speaker was, both for governance and for public appearance. Johnson also hasn't made as many enemies as the prior nominees, in part because he's only been in Congress since 2016. But Johnson also has cachet in the MAGA fringe of the House and with Trump, because he was, as The New York Times described him last year , \"the most important architect of the Electoral College objections\" to certifying the election.\n\nA certain logic dictates that the leader of the House GOP would be an election denier, because the median GOP member is . In 2021, 139 House Republicans voted not to certify the election, and 109 of them remain in the House out of 221 current total Republicans. Of the GOP members who have been newly elected since, several are election deniers. (One, Derrick Van Orden of Wisconsin , was even present at the Stop the Steal rally before the riot.) But what is striking is how a failed vote nearly three years ago became a central issue in the weeks-long speaker fight.\n\nDavid A. Graham: The wackadoodle wave\n\nKevin McCarthy, the recently deposed speaker, fit the bill, having voted not to certify. But McCarthy is widely viewed as an institutionalist, so his vote garnered him neither much credibility with conservatives nor the condemnation it deserved among some Democratic and mainstream observers. For better or worse, McCarthy's vote was treated as cynical, insincere politicking. (It didn't help that he was publicly bullied into signing an amicus brief to the Supreme Court challenging the results in four states.)\n\nBut Johnson was not just a member going along with the election denial for political expediency. He was the intellectual force-such as it was-behind one major prong of the denial. Although Johnson is mild-mannered and little-known outside Congress, he's practically just Jim Jordan with a suit jacket , conservative glasses, and a less hectoring voice.\n\nJohnson, a constitutional lawyer by profession, concocted what he called a \"third option\" to allow Republicans to challenge the election without endorsing the wildest claims of flipped votes and Venezuelan interventions . Instead, as the Times reported in detail , he argued that the way some states had changed voting procedures in response to the coronavirus pandemic was unconstitutional. Delivered in a careful way, this seemed like a lawyerly argument, but the intended effect was radical: It aimed to have the votes of several key states that voted for Biden simply thrown out, disenfranchising millions of Americans and handing Trump reelection. (The premise was also shaky; the number of votes affected by the changes wouldn't have flipped the states.)\n\nRead: 'We put sharp knives in the hands of children'\n\nWhen Texas's attorney general made a similar argument to the U.S. Supreme Court, Johnson wrote an amicus brief in support of it and rounded up House Republicans to sign it, using an implicit threat: He said that Trump would \"be anxiously awaiting the final list\" of signers to review. According to the Times , the lawyer for House Republican leaders said that Johnson's arguments didn't hold water, but he still managed to get 125 members to sign. Nevertheless, the Supreme Court rejected the argument in December 2020, saying that Texas had no standing to sue.\n\nHaving run out of other options, many of the same Republicans decided to vote on January 6 not to certify the election. Johnson put out a phenomenally disingenuous statement explaining that vote, in which he spread claims that undermined faith in elections despite a lack of evidence or legal grounding, all in the name of building faith. \"Our extraordinary republic has endured for nearly two and a half centuries based on the consent of the governed,\" he and 36 colleagues wrote . \"That consent is grounded in the confidence of our people in the legitimacy of our institutions of government. Among our most fundamental institutions is the system of free and fair elections we rely upon, and any erosion in that foundation jeopardizes the stability of our republic.\" Johnson also told The New Yorker , apparently with a straight face, that he \"genuinely believe[d]\" that Trump was challenging the election on principle and not just to stay in power.\n\nLast night, after Johnson was designated the speaker nominee, a reporter asked him about his role in trying to overturn the election. His colleagues jeered at the reporter while Johnson smirked and then said, \"Next question.\" The dismissiveness is unwarranted, especially when three former lawyers for Trump have pleaded guilty to crimes related to election subversion just in the past week. But Republican members don't want to talk about the topic, because they know that election denial is not popular with the American people . Within the GOP caucus, however, it's not just mainstream-it might be a prerequisite for leadership."

      "text": "The House GOP's Investigation Conundrum\n\nA slim Republican majority might spite itself to own the libs.\n\nThe list of investigative priorities for the House Judiciary Committee that the incoming chairperson, Jim Jordan, sent to the Justice Department earlier this month reads like an assignment sheet for Fox News.\n\nAnd that was before Jordan, with incoming House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chair James Comer , repeatedly insisted the FBI had colluded with \"Big Tech\" to undermine former president Donald Trump by \"suppressing\" information about Hunter Biden's laptop prior to the 2020 election.\n\nIt was also before reports surfaced that Kevin McCarthy, in his bid to secure the votes as speaker, promised far-right members of his caucus that he would authorize investigations into the Justice Department's treatment of the insurrectionists who rioted in support of Trump on January 6. This was also before McCarthy threatened to launch impeachment proceedings against Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.\n\nTwo months before taking power, the new House Republican majority has signaled that its investigative agenda will channel the preoccupations of the former president and his die-hard base of supporters. But it has set this course immediately after a midterm election in which voters outside the core conservative states sent an unmistakable signal of their own by repeatedly rejecting Trump-backed candidates in high-profile Senate and gubernatorial races. That contrast captures why the GOP's plans for aggressive investigations of President Joe Biden may present as much political risk for the investigators as it does for the targets.\n\nRead: The new majority\n\nHouse Republicans and their allies are confident that the investigations will weaken Biden in advance of the 2024 presidential election. \"This is not just superficial stuff-this is damaging stuff,\" former Republican Representative Tom Davis, who chaired the National Republican Congressional Committee, told me.\n\nBut the new majority's focus on airing echo-chamber conservative obsessions risks further stamping the GOP as the party of Trump precisely as more Republican leaders and donors insist the recent election results demonstrate the need to move beyond him.\n\n\"All these folks are coming out saying, 'Turn the page; move forward' ... and I think this is really a problem if some of these [House] members are going to continue to look back and embrace Trump at a time when we saw the most Trumpian candidates get their heads handed to them,\" former Republican Representative Charlie Dent told me.\n\nThe choices confronting GOP leaders on what-and how-to investigate encapsulates the much larger challenge they will face in managing the House. This month's midterm election left the GOP with a House majority much smaller than it expected. The results also created a kind of split-personality caucus operating with very different political incentives.\n\nMost incoming House Republicans represent districts in Trump country: 168 of them hold seats that Trump won by 10 percentage points or more in 2020 . Another three dozen represent more marginal Republican-leaning seats that Trump carried by fewer than 10 points two years ago.\n\nBut the GOP majority relies on what will likely be 18 members (when all the final votes are counted) who won districts that voted for Biden in 2020. Eleven of those 18 are in New York and California alone-two states that will likely become considerably more difficult for Republicans in a presidential-election year than during a midterm contest.\n\nFor the Republicans from the hard-core Trump districts, demonstrating a commitment to confronting Biden at every turn is crucial for preempting any possible primary challenges from their right, says the Democratic consultant Meredith Kelly, a former communications director at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. But, as Dent told me, the Republicans precariously holding the Biden seats have the \"polar opposite\" incentive: \"They need to have bipartisan victories and wins.\"\n\nAmid that cross-pressure, many analysts second the prediction of outgoing Democratic Representative David Price of North Carolina, a political scientist who has written several books about Congress, that the new GOP House majority is not likely to pass much legislation. The problem, Price told me, is not only the partisan and ideological fracture in the GOP caucus, but that its members do not have \"an agenda that they campaigned on or they are committed to.\"\n\nAll members of the GOP caucus might agree on legislation to extend the Trump tax cuts, to promote more domestic energy production, or to increase funding for border security. But resistance from the Republicans in blue and purple districts may frustrate many of the right's most ambitious legislative goals, such as repealing elements of Biden's Inflation Reduction Act, passing a national ban on abortion, and forcing cuts to Social Security and Medicare.\n\nWith their legislative opportunities limited, House Republicans may see relentless investigation of Biden and his administration as a path of least resistance that can unite their caucus. And, several observers in both parties told me, all sides in the GOP are likely to support efforts to probe the White House's policy record. Such targets could include the administration's handling of border security, the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, and how it is allocating the clean-energy tax credits and loan guarantees that the Inflation Reduction Act established.\n\nBut Republicans have already indicated they are unlikely to stop at such conventional targets.\n\nJordan, in his letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland earlier this month, warned of coming investigations into the Justice Department's treatment of Project Veritas; allegations that the department has targeted conservative parents as \"domestic terrorists\" for their actions at school-board meetings; and the department's decision making in the choice to execute a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nAt the press conference last week with Jordan, Comer declared that evidence from the GOP's investigation of Hunter Biden's business activities, including information obtained from his laptop, \"raises troubling questions about whether President Biden is a national-security risk.\"\n\nJordan, asked at that press conference about the reports that McCarthy has committed to an investigation of the prosecution and treatment of the January 6 rioters, refused to deny it, instead repeating his determination to explore all examples of alleged politicization at the Justice Department. At one point, Jordan, an unwavering defender of Trump through his two impeachments, delivered an impassioned attack on federal law enforcement that reprised a long list of familiar Trump grievances. \"When is the FBI going to quit interfering with elections?\" Jordan excitedly declared.\n\nDavid Frum: Another flop from GOP Productions\n\nJordan doesn't even represent the outer edge of conservative ambition to use House investigations to settle scores for Trump. Earlier this week, Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida tweeted that when Republicans take the majority, they \"should take over the @January6thCmte and release every second of footage that will exonerate our Patriots!\"\n\nThat might be a bridge too far even for McCarthy. But as he scrambles to overcome conservative resistance to his bid for speaker, he has already shown deference to demands from the Trump-country members who constitute the dominant bloc in his caucus. One example was the report that he promised Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene that he would allow some investigation into treatment of the January 6 rioters. Another came in his appearance along the Texas border this week. McCarthy went beyond pledging oversight of the Biden administration's border record to raise the much more incendiary (but also Fox-friendly) notion of impeaching Mayorkas .\n\nDent, the former GOP representative, told me that on all these fronts, House Republicans risk pushing oversight to a confrontational peak that may damage its members from marginal seats at least as much as it hurts Biden-particularly if it involves what he described as airing Trump grievances. \"These rabbit holes are just fraught with political peril in these more moderate districts,\" Dent said.\n\nDemocrats hope that the coming GOP investigations will alienate more voters than they alarm. Several Democratic strategists told me they believe that the focus on so many conservative causes will both spotlight the most extreme Trump-aligned voices in the Republican caucus, such as Jordan and Greene, and strike swing voters as a distraction from their kitchen-table concerns.\n\nLeslie Dach, a veteran Democratic communications strategist now serving as a senior adviser to the Congressional Integrity Project, a group mobilizing to respond to the investigations, told me the GOP inquiries will inexorably identify the party with the same polarizing style of Trump-like politics that voters just repudiated in states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Arizona. \"We saw in this election that voters reject the Trump playbook and MAGA politics, but that is exactly what they will see in these hearings,\" he said.\n\nCongressional investigations always carry the risk of disclosures that could hurt or embarrass Biden and other officials. And whatever they find, investigations also promise to divert significant amounts of the administration's time and energy. The White House has already staffed up a unit in the counsel's office dedicated to responding to the inquiries. Cabinet departments are scrambling to do the same.\n\nRecognizing the potential political risk, several Republican representatives newly elected in Biden districts have already urged their party to move slowly on the probes and instead to prioritize action on economic issues. Their problem is that McCarthy already has given every indication he's likely to prioritize the demands for maximum confrontation from his caucus's pro-Trump majority.\n\n\"If past is prologue, Kevin McCarthy will fall much on the side of the ruby-red Republican base and the pro-investigation, pro-culture-war side,\" Kelly says. \"He's never proven able to stand up to the fringe.\" And that means the new members from Biden-leaning districts who have provided the GOP its narrow majority have reason to sweat almost as much as the Biden administration over the swarm of investigations that House Republicans are poised to unleash."

Jim Jordan (R-OH) to admit the 2024 election was \"free and fair\"-though questioned why the GOP could do so only after Donald Trump won while letting false claims of election fraud run rampant when he lost in 2020.\n\nBash asked the Ohio congressman on Sunday's State of the Union to answer for his party's repeated suggestions of election fraud during the 2020 election, a thread that became a party focal point due to Trump's repeated false assertion that he won the 2020 election. Trump reiterated that claim even after his electoral victory last week when he claimed his incoming chief-of-staff Susie Wiles was \"an integral part of both my 2016 and 2020 successful campaigns\"-only one of which he won.\n\n\"I haven't seen you or your colleagues claiming any election irregularities, no rampant voting fraud this time,\" Bash said. \"It seems to me that Republicans claim voting fraud and election integrity when you lose and not when you win.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJordan, who repeatedly suggested malfeasance in the 2020 election, tried to deflect, bringing up various policy positions he said helped propel Trump to his win. But Bash pressed him further on the issue, noting that Republicans have abandoned all claims of voter fraud even after Trump claimed there was rampant \"cheating\" in Pennsylvania before results came in.\n\n\"I think the Democrats got to ask, why did we go from getting 81 million to getting 70 million?\" Jordan responded. \"What happened to those 10 million people? Maybe they needed-maybe it's not smart to run an election where you have no vision, no record to run.\"\n\nBash then posed the pivotal question: \"Do you believe the 2024 election was free and fair?\"\n\n\"I do,\" Jordan said.\n\n\"And why was it different from 2020 when he lost? Is that the only difference?\" Bash shot back.\n\nJordan then tried to raise various issues, claiming there \"were all kinds of concerns with how the 2020 election was carried out,\" citing signature verification issues of mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania despite dozens of court cases and investigations affirming the 2020 election was free and fair. (The Pennsylvania Supreme Court also ruled ahead of the 2020 election that mail-in ballots could not be rejected over signature issues alone.)\n\nBash ended Jordan's fact-light statements with a fact-based assertion: \"There was no evidence of widespread fraud in 2020.\"\n\nMedia Reporter\n\ncorbin.bolies@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

Jim Jordan 's bid to become Speaker of the House (at least until January, when he might run again), Republicans appear to have dodged a massive bullet on Thursday.\n\nSure, it was a small band of Republicans ( 22 on the second ballot ) who rallied to stop Jordan-a man who was involved in Donald Trump 's attempt to overturn the 2020 election -from becoming speaker . But it was a much slimmer minority of Republicans who made Jordan's ascension plausible in the first place.\n\nAnd let's be honest: If Jordan had managed to win the speakership, we'd be rightly lamenting that \"the Trumpification of the GOP was now complete with a Big Lie promoter becoming Speaker.\" So, it's only fair to give credit to Republicans who pumped the brakes.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIt couldn't have been easy. Jordan's team tried to bully holdouts into submission . One GOP member, who voted for Jordan in the first round but against him in the second, even received \" credible death threats and a barrage of threatening calls .\" And she wasn't the only member who said they received threats this week.\n\nThe pressure campaign backfired . For once, the center held.\n\nNormie pols who are interested in governing, comity, and institutions usually lose a game of \"chicken\" against nihilists or political arsonists. But this time, the normies stood firm.\n\nThey didn't just fight hard; they fought smart.\n\nSome of Jordan's Republican adversaries, for example, told CNN's Melanie Zanona that \"they've been purposely staggering their 'no' votes over multiple ballots-a strategy designed to show Jordan's speakership opposition is only growing.\"\n\nIf true, this was a shrewd way to hinder a narrative suggesting that Jordan was inching towards victory. If anything, it demonstrated that he was losing momentum. They bled him, and it worked.\n\nThis is a long way of saying that, for the first time in a long time, the GOP \"establishment\" has earned our respect. And while this does not mean the GOP has totally redeemed itself, it does mean that they have taken a crucial step back from the abyss of an almost entirely MAGA-dominated Republican Party.\n\nI would also argue that, aside from all the potentially serious governing problems that a Jordan speakership might have entailed (a failure to keep the government open, potentially not helping to fund Ukraine's defense against Russia, etc.), Republicans have also avoided a serious political threat in 2024: The likelihood that Jordan, as speaker, would have reinforced Joe Biden's plan to run against MAGA, not just Trump .\n\nThink of it this way: If voters show up in Nov. 2024 and are thinking about inflation or which candidate is too old, Biden will likely lose. So Biden needs to ensure that there is some other, more worrying, topic to focus on, instead.\n\nAs such, Joe Biden wants the 2024 election to be a referendum on MAGA chaos, coups, and a fear of losing liberal democracy itself. In the wake of Roe v. Wade being overturned, abortion also remains a potent issue for Democrats to wield against Republicans.\n\nIf the voters' main focus is on these issues, Biden wins and Trump loses.\n\nBut what does any of this have to do with Jim Jordan?\n\nSpeaker Jordan would have symbolically reinforced the very issues that would cause House Republicans-and Donald Trump -to lose in 2024.\n\nAs noted above, Jordan was involved in advancing Trump's Big Lie, as well as in attempting to stop the certification of Biden's presidency . And during the nominating speech for Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on Tuesday, Rep. Pete Aguilar (D-CA) noted that Jordan was responsible for \"authoring the very bill that would ban abortion nationwide without exceptions and inciting violence on this chamber.\"\n\nThe ads write themselves. Perhaps this is why Democrats were so gleeful at the prospect of a Speaker Jordan. \"Democrats think Jordan will cost Republican seats in 2024, opening up a path to the majority,\" reported The Washington Post on Tuesday. \"They are likely to tie Jordan to Trump, who is leading in the presidential Republican primary by double digits, and paint the entire party as MAGA extremists, multiple Democrats say.\"\n\nBy stopping Jordan's speaker bid, 22 House Republicans have undermined this Democratic talking point.\n\nNow, if you are an accelerationist who buys into a Leninist \"worse is better\" theory of politics that says that the only way to save America is for Republicans to go completely off the rails, or that all Republicans are equally evil, then Jordan not becoming speaker is bad news.\n\nBut if you (like me) think that it's incumbent upon us to prevent election deniers from obtaining the upper echelons of power, then this development is worth celebrating.\n\nChalk one up for Team Normal . It's a rare win for them. Here's hoping it's the first of many.\n\nSenior Columnist\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "Jim Jordan, Who Defied Subpoena, Threatens Hunter With Contempt\n\nSenior Media Reporter\n\nShortly after Hunter Biden announced Wednesday that he'll defy House Republicans' demand that he appear in a closed-door deposition, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-OH) threatened to hold the president's son in contempt of Congress.\n\nThe MAGA congressman's indignation over Biden's refusal to comply with the subpoena, however is more than a little ironic considering Jordan himself openly ignored the House Jan. 6 committee's requests that he appear for a deposition.\n\nJust hours before Republicans planned a House vote to formally launch the impeachment inquiry into his father, Biden held an impromptu press conference on Capitol Hill to declare that he would only testify publicly before Congress. Additionally, he blasted the GOP's \"shameless\" probe into the Biden family business dealings, which he framed as taking \"the light of my dad's love for me\" and presenting it \"as darkness.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"My father was not financially involved in my business, not as a practicing lawyer, not as a board member of Burisma, not in my partnership with the Chinese private businessman, not in my investments at home and abroad, and certainly not as an artist,\" Biden exclaimed, adding: \"There is no evidence to support the allegations that my father was financially involved in my business because it did not happen.\"\n\nAfter accusing \"MAGA Republicans\" of belittling his \"struggle with addiction\" and trying to \"dehumanize\" him, Biden ended the presser by reiterating his offer to appear in a public hearing. \"Republicans do not want an open process where Americans can see their tactics, expose their baseless inquiry, or hear what I have to say. What are they afraid of? I am here,\" he added.\n\nSpeaking to reporters shortly after Biden's remarks, Jordan and House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) reiterated their previous stance that the presidential scion does not get to set the terms of their investigation. Meanwhile, Comer expressly stated last month that witnesses could \" choose \" to either appear in a deposition or public hearing-comments that Biden and his lawyer Abbe Lowell have repeatedly invoked to defy the GOP subpoena.\n\nRejecting Biden's call to publicly testify, Jordan argued that a congressional hearing would just end in \"filibusters\" and \"speeches\" when all he \"wants is the facts.\" He then said that since the House was about to formalize the impeachment inquiry against President Joe Biden, the president's son could soon be looking at a contempt charge.\n\n\"Mr. Biden's counsel and the White House have both argued that the reason he couldn't come for a deposition was because there wasn't a formal vote for an impeachment inquiry,\" Jordan stated. \"Well, that's going to happen in a few hours. We think it's going to pass. We think the House of Representatives will go on record with a power that solely resides in the House to say we are in an official impeachment inquiry phase of our oversight.\"\n\nThe Ohio congressman concluded: \"And when that happens, we'll see what their excuse is then. They should have been here today, but once we take that vote, we expect him to come in for his interview, for his deposition. And frankly, we'll also, I think, look at contempt proceedings as we move forward.\"\n\nDescribed by the Jan. 6 committee as being a \" significant player \" in Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election results, Jordan outright refused to cooperate with the committee about his knowledge of Trump's role in the Capitol insurrection. In the end, after defying subpoenas to appear for depositions before the committee, Jordan was referred to the House ethics committee.\n\nEarlier this year, in fact, after Republicans demanded that Attorney General Merrick Garland be held in contempt of Congress for declining comment on criminal investigations into Hunter Biden, Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA) taunted Jordan by pulling out a \"Jordan Subpoena Evasion\" clock.\n\nSenior Media Reporter\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "Alvin Bragg Claims Victory as Jim Jordan Seethes About YouTube Gun Vids\n\nPolitical Investigations Reporter\n\nJim Jordan (R-OH) has made himself the Republican gadfly attempting to sting Alvin Bragg , the Manhattan D.A. who has secured the first, and so far only, conviction of former president Donald Trump .\n\nBut now the biter appears to have been bitten-by none other than Bragg. Bragg's office is taking credit for being part of efforts to have YouTube restrict content that shows people how to build firearms or make illegal modifications that allow them to rapidly fire ammunition on a fully automatic setting, confirming an angry claim made by Jordan.\n\nLast week, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee sent the site's parent company a letter demanding to know the story behind YouTube's recent decision to block videos that provide such content.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJordan's letter is a legal request for Alphabet's communications regarding its \"interactions with the executive branch and other entities regarding changes to its firearms content policy.\" It also called out Bragg by name, given that the prominent prosecutor publicly pressured YouTube in April over his concerns about the proliferation of how-to videos of \"ghost guns,\" homemade firearms that aren't stamped with a serial number and are virtually untraceable.\n\nBut in the wake of that letter, Bragg's office is actually doing something of a victory lap.\n\n\"The office stands by any efforts made to encourage companies to act responsibly and prevent children from accessing tutorials to manufacture dangerous guns that can be used in violent crimes,\" a spokeswoman told The Daily Beast.\n\nYouTube did not respond to questions about whether Bragg's public pressure campaign was the deciding factor in its decision to finally clamp down on gun videos. However, in reality, Bragg wasn't the only one.\n\nIn 2021, the policy group Everytown for Gun Safety called on YouTube to take down videos that serve as detailed step-by-step instructional manuals on how to build unserialized pistol and rifle frames. Everytown warned the company that this trend \"allows potentially dangerous or prohibited individuals to manufacture and own untraceable weapons without serial numbers or background checks.\" There's even a danger to experienced firearms enthusiasts who otherwise pose no harm to the public, given that 3D-printed guns are sometimes made of plastic that can't withstand the explosion of a fired round inside the chamber.\n\nThe next year, five Democratic senators pleaded for YouTube to remove ghost gun videos as well, noting how \"this content is a clear and direct violation of YouTube's existing community guidelines on firearms.\"\n\nAnd in 2023, the Tech Transparency Project, which is funded by several social advocacy groups, released a study showing how YouTube's video recommendation algorithms steer preteen and teenage gamers toward content about real life shootings and weapons-despite company assurances that its engineers \"made delivering responsible recommendations\" their \"top priority.\"\n\nViewed in that light, Bragg's letter to YouTube in April requesting to meet face-to-face with YouTube representatives was merely the latest entreaty asking the company to abide by its own rules.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) speaks during a campaign rally hosted by Republican presidential candidate and former U.S. President Donald Trump at the Forum River Center in Rome, Georgia, U.S. March 9, 2024.\n\nBut to Rep. Jordan, who sees conspiracies everywhere he looks, it's all part of some underhanded leftist coercion scheme-as opposed to the desperate attempts of policymakers who are stuck between a rock and a hard place. Any politician who wants to zero-in on gun violence is essentially prohibited from trying to cut off the flow of weapons. For decades, Democrats haven't made any headway with Republicans, who won't agree to any kind of new gun restrictions whatsoever. And they can't even fully utilize the Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives (ATF) law enforcement agency, which remains critically underfunded and just had the conservative-leaning Supreme Court overturn the Trump-era ban on bump stocks-the easily configured attachable gear that uses a fired weapon's recoil to keep it jiggling in place to rapidly pull the trigger faster than anyone could naturally, essentially making it shoot like a sloppy machine gun.\n\nIn his letter, Jordan claimed that \"YouTube has censored First Amendment-protected speech as a result of government agencies' requests and demands in the past.\" He went on to write that \"these revelations raise serious concerns about whether and to what extent the executive branch is working with third parties and other intermediaries to coerce and/or collude with YouTube to censor lawful speech regarding the Second Amendment and firearms.\"\n\nHowever, Jordan couldn't resist turning the letter into yet another partisan screed that somehow connected guns on YouTube to his fervent love of MAGA. In his letter to the company, Jordan wrote that Bragg \"hired the third highest-ranking Department of Justice official to assist in his partisan prosecution of President Trump,\" alluding to the fact that Bragg brought a prosecutor onboard to help develop the criminal case against Trump, which ended with a trial in which jurors concluded the former president committed 34 felonies.\n\nHowever, it isn't clear that YouTube is going very far at all with its new restrictions. Although the company claimed it would no longer allow videos that \"provide instructions on manufacturing\" things like ammunition, many videos are still online. Popular videos still show how to assemble a kit for making ammunition at home, a popular option for budget-conscious firearms enthusiasts who'd rather avoid the high prices of professionally manufactured hunting ammo. Others run through the basics , with detailed looks at how to operate machinery in a safe and clean manner. Taking these down would arguably endanger otherwise responsible gun owners who merely want more control over their own ammunition supply; for example, competition shooters and hunters sometimes prefer \"hotter\" loads that exceed the power of most factory-made cartridges.\n\nThen again, YouTube has yet to eliminate the hundreds of videos that explain how to use milling machinery to professionally turn a hunk of metal into the functional part of a semiautomatic AR-15 rifle. An \"80 percent lower,\" as it's called, is essentially a metal piece that is four-fifths complete-an item that's easily purchased online without any government paperwork. As of Monday afternoon, typing in \"80 percent\" in YouTube's search bar immediately triggers the algorithm to recommend \"80 percent lower milling instructions.\" The list of results is virtually endless.\n\nPolitical Investigations Reporter\n\njose.pagliery@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "I Went Toe to Toe With Jim Jordan in Congress. What a Circus!\n\nShan Wu is a former federal prosecutor who served as counsel to Attorney General Janet Reno\n\nI wasn't quite sure what to expect when I was invited to testify before the Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government . While I have prepared people to testify before Congress, it was the first time I was the one in the witness chair and I expected more stress. Prepping other people allows you the luxury of reacting and word-smithing answers but answering questions as a witness gives you no time to edit or get input before you have to answer. And, as a lawyer, I'm used to being the one asking the questions.\n\nTo get ready I reminded myself of what I would tell my own witnesses, which was that they knew the subject of their own testimony better than anyone else in the room, and that no amount of combative questioning could change that fact. My advice worked well for my preparation, but nothing could have prepared me for how transparently performative were Republicans in their questioning.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe writer, former federal prosecutor Shan Wu, testifies before the Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government.\n\nThe subcommittee is part of the House Judiciary Committee and is chaired by Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, who also chairs the House Judiciary Committee. They've taken to flinging any criticism that can come to mind about the Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg 's conviction of former President Trump on 34 counts of falsifying business records to cover up his alleged sexual encounter with actor and director Stormy Daniels .\n\nParticularly notable is the fact they were holding the hearings even before the trial had concluded, in one instance taking testimony from a witness in that trial-Trump attorney Bob Costello-on a day off from the trial and even before Costello's actual testimony in the trial a few days later. They also sought testimony from Alvin Bragg, who-appropriately-declined, given that sentencing has not occurred in the case, making it an ongoing criminal case .\n\nThe three Republican witnesses (I was the only witness for the Democratic minority) were all there to justify the variety of criticisms about the Bragg case. Jonathan Fahey, a former federal prosecutor, testified about what he called the problem of \"progressive prosecutors\" like Bragg who supposedly were unwilling to prosecute serious crimes. Fahey, who also was the chief of the Immigration Customs Enforcement under Trump for about two weeks before resigning, complained about Bragg being willing to bring a case against the former president while street crime ran rampant (fact check: New York crime has been declining during Bragg's tenure ).\n\nJonathan Fahey, a former federal prosecutor, who testified about what he called the problem of \"progressive prosecutors\" like Alvin Bragg.\n\nJohn H. Wilson, a former New York State judge, was there to testify about his views that Judge Juan Merchan should have recused himself from hearing the case due to an appearance of impropriety arising from Merchan's $15 dollar donation to the Biden campaign and Merchan's daughter working for a Democratic communications firm.\n\nJohn H. Wilson, a former New York State judge who thinks that Judge Juan Merchan should have recused himself from hearing the Trump case over a $15 dollar donation to the Biden campaign.\n\nWilson conceded that Merchan had sought advice from a judicial ethics advisory board which saw no reason for Merchan to recuse but, nonetheless, Wilson believed he should recuse. Sitting next to Wilson, I was quite surprised when he testified that, as a judge, he had never presided over any felony trials. It seemed odd to me that the Republicans would have picked a witness with such limited judicial experience to criticize a judge with far more experience. The third witness was Professor Bradley Smith, a federal campaign finance expert, whom Trump's defense team had planned to call in the trial but ultimately did not.\n\nProfessor Bradley Smith, a federal campaign finance expert, who was not called to testify in the Trump trial after Judge Merchan ruled he could not give an opinion on whether Trump's actions were illegal or not.\n\nThat choice not to call Smith-which the Republican questioners spun as the Trump team being denied the chance to call him-came after Judge Merchan ruled that while Smith could testify as an expert on general legal issues about campaign finance he could not give an opinion on whether Trump's actions were illegal or not, since that was up to the jury. Merchan also ruled that Smith could not testify as a fact witness since he had no personal knowledge of the facts in the case.\n\nWitness testimony began after opening statements by Jim Jordan and the Ranking Minority Member Congresswoman Stacey Plaskett (D), the delegate from the Virgin Islands, and-to my surprise-a Pledge of Allegiance. After being sworn in, the Republican witnesses went first, starting with Professor Smith, who was finally able to give his opinion about the case against Trump. After hearing it, I certainly understood why Judge Merchan restricted his testimony.\n\nAmong his opinions was the case theory was \"laughable\"-an opinion that clearly would have run afoul of an expert witness not being allowed to opine on the ultimate issue in criminal cases. It would be like bringing on a fingerprint expert to testify that the defendant definitely was the murderer. That's not the role of experts. It's the role of the jury.\n\nWhen it was my turn the Republicans went at me first and I was struck by how leading and long-winded the questions were. I should say that the questions had long \"wind-ups\" to the actual question which the questioner used to pose their own opinions. It quickly became apparent that those were much more important than my answers-unless I were agreeing with them. For example, when I pushed back on Representative Dan Bishop's attempt to get me to agree that Congress should be able to inquire into state criminal cases by saying they needed to wait for the case to conclude he either tried to talk over me or interrupt me .\n\nBut time was actually on my side here because each member had only five minutes and as the long-windups went on I watched the digital time ticking away on their efforts to get answers out of me that might help their point of view.\n\nThe Democratic questions were refreshingly substantive, including questions about Project 2025-the Heritage Foundation blueprint for the Trump administration. The questions from Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D. Florida) about the plans for surveillance of abortion statistics were great examples of the real weaponization that Trump has planned. Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett (D. Texas) gave me the only real surprise of the day when she asked me to name the three branches of government as part of her point that Congress should not be interfering with criminal prosecutions. When she agreed with my answers, I felt a little like I'd given the right answer in class.\n\nBut the questions that stuck out at me the most were the ones from Congressman Matt Gaetz (R. Florida) to the Republican witnesses. Gaetz wanted to make the point that convicting Trump under a theory that involved covering up the payments so as not to have them treated as campaign contributions meant that he, Gaetz, could start buying ties and charging them to his campaign.\n\nChairman Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, right, and Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., confer during the House Judiciary Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government.\n\nProclaiming that he hated wearing ties but since people told him that Congressmen were expected to wear ties he might buy his at Ross Dress for Less. Gaetz's \"question\" was all about his theory that the Trump conviction actually would encourage misuse of campaign finance funds. Gaetz's pleasure with himself was blatant as he grinned and snickered throughout. Chairman Jim Jordan appeared to enjoy Gaetz's performance even more than Gaetz, continuously beaming and laughing during Gaetz's questions.\n\nIt was the interaction of Gaetz and Jordan that made the biggest impression upon me. For in their frat-boy style joking I could sense that there was no real substance to their inquiries. Sure, they and their Republican colleagues did a bunch of speechifying in their questions critical of Trump's conviction but that did not seem the real point at all. There in the splendor of the high ceilings and wood panels, the real point for them seemed to have fun and put on a show. But it's a show that masks the real dangers of using the trappings of Congress to interfere with the administration of justice.\n\nAs Ranking Minority Member Plaskett stated, the real hearings should be about the threat of the plans set forth in Project 2025. Therein lies the real weaponization of our government for political gain.\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "Jim Jordan Issues Plea After Speakership Bid Falls Flat on First Ballot\n\nDeputy Politics Editor\n\nPolitics Reporter\n\nThe House GOP's two-week leadership crisis will continue after Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) fell well short of the votes needed to win the speakership on the first ballot Tuesday.\n\nAfter the vote, Jordan posted to X, formerly known as Twitter , begging for harmony among D.C. Republicans he had previously attempted to strong-arm : \"We must stop attacking each other and come together,\" he wrote. \"There's too much at stake. Let's get back to working on the crisis at the southern border, inflation, and helping Israel.\"\n\nUltimately, 20 Republicans voted for someone other than Jordan-nearly seven times as many as he could afford to lose.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThere was no viable alternative candidate: seven voted for Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) and six voted for former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, both of whom are not currently running. Three New Yorkers voted for former Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-NY), who has not expressed interest in running. One voted for Rep. Mike Garcia (R-CA), which seemed to surprise Garcia , and Tom Emmer (R-MN), Tom Cole (R-OK), and Thomas Massie (R-KY) all got one vote as well.\n\nJordan and his allies never predicted he would win on the first ballot, but they hoped the opposition would keep to the single digits-ensuring that pressure on the holdouts could deliver a Jordan victory by the second or third round.\n\nInstead, the Jordan holdouts offered a strong show of force against the Judiciary Chairman, seeming to suggest he may never have the votes to win.\n\nThe group of detractors consisted of McCarthy and Scalise loyalists, vulnerable incumbents concerned with Jordan's far-right politics, a group of New York Republicans who may want to negotiate for their votes, and members who have simply fumed over the right wing-driven process that brought the party to the brink.\n\n\"His tactics certainly didn't work on me,\" said Rep. Carlos Gimenez (R-FL), who voted for McCarthy. \"Actually, I become more cemented in a position.\"\n\nNow, Jordan and his allies must figure out how to flip his substantial opposition-privately, or in a marathon series of floor votes like the one Kevin McCarthy survived to win the office back in January.\n\nOr Jordan may step aside and allow someone else to come forward-like McCarthy, Emmer, or the current caretaker speaker, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC).\n\nIn a promising sign for Jordan, some of the initial votes against him appeared to be one-off shows of protest.\n\n\"I was for Kevin McCarthy the whole time and I thought the process has been terrible, what has happened to him,\" said Rep. Doug LaMalfa (R-CA). \"So, I'm voting for Jim Jordan because he's a good guy, he's done good work on committee, and we need to move forward with this place today and get our work done.\"\n\nOthers were indicating they are still in play, like Rep. John James (R-MI), who said \"stand by\" when asked if he would back Jordan on the next round.\n\n\"The priority is right now and will always be my district,\" said James, who represents a competitive suburban district. \"I will always vote for people here who will prioritize the needs of my district.\"\n\nFaced with another protracted speakership floor fight, lawmakers were as in the dark as any casual observer of this messy and unprecedented process. McHenry recessed the House floor after the vote Tuesday afternoon, leaving Republicans waiting for word on when they would meet to discuss their options.\n\nRep. Chip Roy (R-TX), a Jordan ally, told The Daily Beast that he expected Jordan to run again and ultimately prevail in a coming round of votes-which could come later this afternoon.\n\n\"The way I look at it is, Jim got 200 votes for Speaker of the House,\" said Roy. Addressing those who did not vote for Jordan, the Texas Republican said, \"Why do you oppose Jim Jordan? Give me your reasons for why you're voting no. I mean, is it just because you're angry? That's not a message.\"\n\nIt is far from a given that the Ohio Republican-who as co-founder of the House Freedom Caucus pioneered the brand of zero-sum, ideologically driven House GOP politics that doomed McCarthy's speakership-will be able to unite the conference.\n\nIn certain GOP circles, some were taking a victory lap around Jordan's grave, pointing fingers for his failure and taking pleasure in his defeat.\n\n\"It shouldn't surprise anyone,\" said a senior GOP aide, \"that a former wrestling coach with zero accomplishments other than shouting louder than the next guy just went down in flames on national TV.\"\n\n\"The dumbass tweets from DC Draino and Benny Johnson calling everyone opposing Jordan a RINO are hurting Jordan,\" another senior GOP aide told The Daily Beast.\n\nAll but a few Republicans wanted this scenario. But with the House floor paralyzed until a new speaker is elected, and with members anxious to start work to avert a shutdown on Nov. 17 and approve aid for Israel, there seems to be a clear appetite on the GOP side to simply elect someone and move on.\n\nEven if that someone is Jordan, a man who former Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) once called a \"legislative terrorist ,\" successfully maneuvered his party into at least one government shutdown that ended exactly 10 years ago today, has not passed a single piece of legislation with his name on it since his election in 2006, and vocally backed former President Donald Trump's baseless claims of election fraud in 2020.\n\nBut the opposition to Jordan reflects the remarkable level of anger, frustration, and bitterness that has festered in the House GOP conference since McCarthy's ouster-feelings that will be hard for Jordan to quell, particularly because his push for the gavel only seemed to exacerbate divides.\n\nAfter McCarthy fell, Jordan wasn't even the party's consensus choice to succeed him. That was Scalise, the House GOP's longtime No. 2. In a private secret ballot vote last week for the party's speakership nomination, Scalise defeated Jordan by a margin of 113 to 99.\n\nBut instead of honoring party tradition of backing the nominee, Jordan's supporters refused to support Scalise on the floor, ensuring he would fail. Jordan said he would get behind Scalise, but only tepidly. With no path forward, the Louisiana Republican bowed out of contention on Thursday, paving the way for Jordan to re-enter the race.\n\nOn Friday, Jordan defeated token opposition-Rep. Austin Scott (R-GA), who said he didn't even want the job-by a surprisingly narrow margin to win the speaker nomination. All of a sudden, the hardliners who were vowing to block Scalise were now urging Jordan's opponents to be team players and put aside their differences to get behind the Ohio Republican.\n\nCrucially, Jordan's allies carried out a campaign to pressure holdouts , one in which right-wing media personalities and MAGA influencers steered grassroots outrage to members who had not supported Jordan.\n\nBy Monday afternoon, it looked as if Jordan had all but eliminated his most serious remaining obstacles to the Speaker's gavel. One by one, key anti-Jordan holdouts-members who pledged not to vote for him as recently as this past weekend-came out in support of him.\n\nBut the dam had not broken enough by Tuesday to deliver Jordan the speakership. Republican lawmakers appeared to be prepared for a long fight.\n\n\"Two things you really don't like watching being made are law and sausage, because it ruins the taste and both of them,\" said Rep. Mike Bost (R-IL) ahead of the Tuesday vote. \"And unfortunately, as our members asked early on for an open process, this open process sometimes looks pretty ugly, but it's still the best process out there because the people are still in control.\n\nDeputy Politics Editor\n\nSam.Brodey@thedailybeast.com\n\nPolitics Reporter\n\nriley.rogerson@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

The DOJ later noted that after Smirnov was arrested, he \"admitted that officials associated with Russian intelligence were involved in passing a story about\" the president's son Hunter Biden and Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company he worked for.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nJim Jordan said recently the \"most corroborating evidence we have is that 1023 form from this highly credible confidential human source\" Asked Jordan this AM about indictment charging the source made up Biden bribery scheme and had told FBI that Russian intel was behind claim pic.twitter.com/5CpjYaPZNR\n\nWith House Republicans describing the FD-1023 as the \"heart\" of their impeachment case against Biden and right-wing media relentlessly promoting it for months, CNN chief congressional correspondent Manu Raju pressed Jordan to weigh in on Smirnov's arrest and that the informant's claims were based on Russian intelligence.\n\nThe MAGA lawmaker immediately attempted to pivot, claiming that it \"doesn't change the four fundamental facts\" behind his impeachment push, which is essentially just a rehashing of the debunked theory that led to former President Donald Trump's first impeachment.\n\nRattling off his \"four fundamental facts,\" a well-worn talking point he has been repeating ad nauseam for years, Jordan concluded by insisting then-Vice President Biden did Burisma's bidding by pressuring Ukraine to fire a corrupt prosecutor. In previous instances, however, Jordan had said his \"facts\" lent credence to Smirnov's bribery allegations.\n\nRaju, meanwhile, reminded the Ohio Republican that he has recently told Fox News that \"the 1023 is the most corroborating piece of information\" and was from a \"highly credible confidential human source.\"\n\nA sputtering Jordan shot back that the new revelations about the informant's claims still \"doesn't change those fundamental facts,\" prompting a shocked Raju to interject: \"But it's not true!\"\n\nThe Judiciary chairman then countered with what appears to be the growing narrative in pro-Trump circles -that the FBI is at fault for giving credibility to Smirnov's unsubstantiated allegations.\n\n\"This source was a paid source by the FBI. When we were trying to get the 1023, they told us this could jeopardize national security, and the safety of this source,\" Jordan exclaimed. \"They didn't want to release it! And now they're saying he gave false information.\" (The feds, in fact, initially did not want to publicly release the FD-1023 largely because Smirnov's claims were unverified.)\n\n\"But your promotion of a bribery scheme was false,\" the CNN reporter retorted, leading Jordan to say, \"Not at all,\" while once more leaning on his \"four facts\" talking point.\n\n\"What Smirnov said is not true; you at least concede that?\" Raju fired back.\n\n\"Well, yeah, that's what the FBI is saying,\" Jordan shrugged.\n\nSenior Media Reporter\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Jim Jordan Could Bully His Way to Being Speaker of the House\n\nSenior Columnist\n\nOhio Rep. Jim Jordan 's expertise may be in college wrestling, but he might excel even more in the world of professional wrestling as a \" heel .\" Consider the heavy-handed arm-twisting being employed to try and make him Speaker of the House .\n\n\"Several of Mr. Jordan's supporters have posted the phone numbers of mainstream G.O.P. lawmakers they count as holdouts,\" according to The New York Times .\n\nOne of the holdouts targeted was Rep. Mike Rogers (R-AL). Like clockwork, Rogers joined other erstwhile Jordan opponents on Monday, announcing that he would support Jordan .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMeanwhile, a producer for Fox News's Sean Hannity reportedly began a thinly veiled pressure campaign by querying GOP House members about their refusal to support Jordan.\n\n\"Sources tell Hannity that rep xxxx is not supporting Rep Jim Jordan for Speaker,\" an email purportedly sent from Hannity's producer to one lawmaker reads . \"Can you please let me know if this is accurate? And, if true, Hannity would like to know why during a war breaking out between Israel and Hamas, with the war in Ukraine, with the wide open borders, with a budget that's unfinished [,] why would Rep. xxxx be against Jim Jordan for speaker?\"\n\nNot since a Tucker Carlson questionnaire scared Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis into throwing Ukraine under the bus has \"just asking questions\" been so effective.\n\nBut will this intimidation be enough to overcome Jordan's vote deficit?\n\nThe stakes are high. If Jordan wins, it means Republicans will have elected a speaker who opposes Ukraine funding and wanted then-Vice President Mike Pence to reject Joe Biden electoral votes .\n\nWhat is more, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz 's insurgent strategy will have been successful, as a small group (just four percent) of House Republicans will have unilaterally ousted a House speaker-and replaced him with their chosen successor.\n\nSome Republican members are sounding the alarm over the unspoken precedent. \"I'm a 'no' on allowing Matt Gaetz and the other seven to win by putting their individual in as speaker,\" said Rep. John Rutherford (R-FL) on Friday.\n\nIn response, Gaetz took to his Twitter feed, publicly calling out Rutherford. \"I hope he gets some feedback from Floridians that this is selfish and bad for the country,\" Gaetz declared .\n\nIf you've never been on the business end of a Twitter dragging, you might not appreciate how Gaetz's call for \"feedback\" was tacitly urging his 2.4 million Twitter followers to harass Rutherford.\n\nSome percentage of Gaetz's followers will send mean tweets. Others will make phone calls. And others... Well, it's hard to say what some small band of renegade followers might do.\n\nThese days, there's a fine line between political threats (such as finding an opponent to \"primary\" a politician) and other types of threats.\n\nWill Rutherford fold like Rogers did? Stay tuned.\n\nThe obvious problem is that this is a game of asymmetric warfare. You know the line : \"The best lack all conviction, while the worst/ Are full of passionate intensity.\"\n\nNormies who crave comity and value norms and institutions are more likely to fold to pressure. Meanwhile, radical right-wingers are rewarded by a system where the worst get on top .\n\nThat's not to say Jordan should start measuring for drapes quite yet. As I write this, he is still shy of the requisite 217 votes needed to become speaker, though he is inching towards that goal ; a vote is scheduled for Tuesday on the floor of the House.\n\nTraditionally, a nominee would hope to avoid a public vote unless he were reasonably sure to win (this is why Scalise dropped out).\n\nBut Jordan's calculus is different. With MAGA grassroots on his side, he figures that holding a public vote will either encourage wayward Republicans to support him or smoke out his enemies. Either way, it will facilitate the next wave of high-pressure campaigns designed to whip them in line.\n\n\"I'll vote my conscience, which is a 'no,' but I don't want to be a punching bag for the next three days,\" one member told The Washington Post . \"Right now, Jordan is woefully short on votes, and his team wants to beat folks into submission.\"\n\nIn many ways, this pressure campaign harkens back to the way Trump sicced his MAGA minions on Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) to persuade the senator to see things his way. First, Trump gave out his phone number during the 2016 campaign. And then, after Jan. 6, 2021 (when Graham announced he had had enough), Graham was heckled and harassed by Trump supporters at the airport.\n\nAnd Jordan has something going for him that even Trump lacks: The capacity to at least pretend to play nice. As the pro-Jordan pressure campaign heats up, Jordan, himself, is launching a sort of charm offensive-transforming from heel to babyface , as it were.\n\nIn Rep. Mike Rogers' endorsement, for example, Rogers says he and Jordan \"had two cordial, thoughtful, and productive conversations over the past two days.\"\n\nAnd in a recent interview with CNN's Jake Tapper, Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX), who supports Jordan, said Jordan's \"reputation has changed over time\" and that he has \"become part of the solution.\"\n\nHas Jordan, 59, suddenly found Jesus, or is he just gaslighting us?\n\nAt least give him credit for hustling. Jordan, who is holding one-on-one meetings with various holdouts , sent out a unifying and optimistic \" Dear colleague\" letter on Monday that promises to \"bring all Republicans together.\"\n\nSincere or not, Team Jordan's \"good cop/bad cop\" routine is smart. It provides normal Republicans with an off-ramp to support Jordan, while also saving face. It is, after all, more honorable to be sweet-talked than to be intimidated.\n\nIf Jim Jordan becomes Speaker Jordan, that's what they will tell themselves, anyway.\n\nSenior Columnist\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "CNN Airs Vulgar Voicemail Targeting GOP Rep Who Voted Against Jim Jordan\n\nAs Republicans continue to struggle over who should be the next Speaker of the House following Rep. Kevin McCarthy 's (R-CA) ouster, some lawmakers who have not voted for Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), the GOP's nominee, have been receiving angry messages from constituents-and even several death threats.\n\nCNN got a hold of one such vulgar voicemail from a male caller to an unnamed Republican's wife, airing the message in full Thursday night for its viewers to hear.\n\n\"Why is your husband such a pig?\" the caller said. \"Why would he get on TV and make an asshole of himself? Because he's a deep state prick? Because he doesn't represent the people?\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"So what we're gonna do is we're going fucking follow you all over the place,\" he continued. \"We're gonna be up your ass fucking nonstop. We are now Antifa. We're gonna do what the left does because your fucking faggot of a husband gets on TV, 'Oh, the bad guys, they did stuff. I'm gonna vote for Kevin McCarthy,'-a piece of shit.\"\n\n\"That is disgusting!\" host Jake Tapper said in response.\n\nThe chances of Jordan's ascension to speaker have seemingly worsened by the day. The Ohio congressman saw 20 members of his party vote against him on Tuesday, and on Wednesday that number had grown to 22 -much more than the amount Jordan can afford to lose.\n\nOn Thursday, the Judiciary Committee chairman's nomination wasn't even brought to a vote, with Republicans instead holding a lengthy closed-door argument that apparently got so intense that one had to leave early to pray . Jordan has since indicated he will not back out of the race, but does intend on supporting a plan to temporarily boost the authority of Speaker pro tempore, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC).\n\nIt remains to be seen how many more lawmakers will be subjected to calls like the one that aired on CNN's The Lead, given the pro-Jordan pressure campaign that was carried out by Fox News host Sean Hannity and other Jordan allies.\n\nThose efforts, some Republicans have since admitted , \"backfired.\"\n\nThe unidentified caller pledged that the messages and calls would not subside.\n\n\"Fuck you, fuck your husband, and we are gonna-we're not like the left, we aren't violent-but we're gonna follow your ass to every appointment you have, everything you fucking do,\" he said.\n\n\"So listen, you're going to keep getting calls and emails. I'm putting all your information over the internet now. Everybody else is,\" he said ominously. \"And you will not be left alone because of your fucking faggot husband. Jim Jordan or more conservative or you're going to be fucking molested like you can't ever imagine. And again, non-violently. You won't go to the beauty parlor. You must be a bitch to marry a fucking ugly motherfucker like that.\"\n\nwilliam.vaillancourt@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "Who is Jim Jordan? The hard-right House speaker contender dogged by scandal\n\nContender for House speaker, described as 'political terrorist' by John Boehner, also linked to Ohio State sexual abuse scandal\n\nJim Jordan, the Ohio congressman who is seeking to become House speaker, is a prominent celebrity on the far right of US politics - and a magnet for controversy who a former speaker from his own party once called a \"political terrorist\".\n\nJordan, 59, was elected to Congress in 2006 from a conservative, rural district of Ohio. A high school and college wrestling champion, he made his mark on the House as a founder of the hard-right Freedom caucus, helping oust former speaker John Boehner, who was not deemed sufficiently extreme.\n\nBut Jordan has not been free of controversy himself. He has long been dogged by questions about a sexual abuse scandal at Ohio State University, where he was a wrestling coach before he entered politics, while the full extent of his involvement in Donald Trump's attempt to overturn the 2020 election, leading up to the deadly attack on Congress, remains unknown.\n\nIn the last Congress, when Democrats held the gavel, Jordan refused to cooperate with the House January 6 committee, despite being served with a subpoena.\n\nBut his involvement in Trump's machinations has been widely reported. He is known, for instance, to have spoken with the then president on the morning of the riot.\n\nIn their book I Alone Can Fix It: Donald J Trump's Catastrophic Final Year, the Washington Post reporters Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig reported a startling conversation from the day after the riot, 7 January 2021.\n\nAccording to Rucker and Leonnig, Liz Cheney, then a Wyoming Republican congresswoman, and future vice-chair of the January 6 committee, spoke to Gen Mark Milley, then chair of the joint chiefs of staff.\n\n\"That fucking guy Jim Jordan ,\" Cheney said. \"That son of a bitch. While these maniacs are going through the place, I'm standing in the aisle and he said, 'We need to get the ladies away from the aisle. Let me help you.'\n\n\"I smacked his hand away and told him: 'Get away from me. You fucking did this.'\"\n\nJordan was a prominent supporter of Trump's lie about electoral fraud. Efforts on Trump's behalf included speaking at a \"Stop the Steal\" rally in Pennsylvania two days after election day; attending White House meetings at which strategy was discussed; appearing on Fox News to promote such efforts; and, on the morning of January 6 itself, speaking in the House, to object to results from Arizona.\n\nFive days after the Capitol attack, Trump gave Jordan the presidential medal of freedom.\n\nJordan has said he uses his background in wrestling in his approach to politics, particularly as an aggressive questioner in committee hearings.\n\n\"I look at it like a wrestling match,\" Jordan told the New York Times in April. \"I'm going to try to get as ready as I can. You can't just wing it.\"\n\nBut the Ohio State sexual abuse scandal also rumbles on.\n\nFrom 1987 to 1995, Jordan was an assistant wrestling coach at OSU. Former athletes have said he turned a blind eye to abuse perpetrated by Richard Strauss, a doctor, which according to an official report was widely seen as an \" open secret \".\n\nJordan denies a cover-up. He also refused to cooperate with the official investigation .\n\nOne ex-OSU wrestler, Dunyasha Yetts, has said: \"If Jordan says he didn't know about it, then he's lying.\"\n\nAnother, Mike Schyck, recently told NBC News : \"Do you really want a guy in that job who chose not to stand up for his guys? Is that the kind of character trait you want for a House speaker?\"\n\nFor Jordan, becoming speaker might also invite uncomfortable mentions of Dennis Hastert, from Illinois and the longest-serving Republican speaker, filling the role from 1999 to 2007.\n\nAfter leaving politics, Hastert became embroiled in scandal, eventually admitting to sexually abusing teenage boys while a wrestling coach himself, then paying his accusers to stay quiet. He was sentenced to 15 months in prison.\n\nDespite it all, for Jordan, seizing the speaker's gavel - and thereby becoming second-in-line to the presidency - would cap a congressional career that began in 2006 and has included leading the powerful judiciary committee and being the first chair of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus .\n\nIt was Boehner, a former speaker also from Ohio, who famously referred to Jordan as a \"political terrorist\", only interested in destructive action rather than legislative achievement.\n\nIn 2021, Boehner told CBS : \"I just never saw a guy who spent more time tearing things apart - never building anything, never putting anything together.\"\n\nThis month, as Jordan homed in on becoming speaker himself, Cheney said his success would damage the party severely.\n\n\"If the Republicans decide that Jim Jordan should be the speaker of the House,\" she said, \"there would no longer be any possible way to argue that a group of elected Republicans could be counted on to defend the constitution.\"\n\nThis article was amended on 17 October 2023. An earlier version incorrectly stated that Paul Ryan was ousted from House speakership. Ryan stepped down in 2018."

But while the Ohio congressman and his allies say they will have the votes soon, Jordan also has a long history of controversial views that many of his own party members and constituents are not aligned with.\n\nHere are some of the key things to know about Jordan as a politician - and a look into how he might act in the role of speaker.\n\nJordan was a \" significant player \" in Trump's efforts to overturn the election, according to the House committee that investigated the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. As early as November of 2020, he was part of discussions with Trump campaign and White House officials examining whether Mike Pence could overturn the election. Immediately after the election, he met with Trump campaign and White House officials at the campaign's headquarters to help develop a strategy of repeatedly, and falsely, saying the election was fraudulent, the New York Times reported .\n\nOn 2 January 2021, Jordan led a conference call with members of Congress and the White House in which they discussed urging Trump supporters to march to the Capitol. The day before the January 6 attack, Jordan texted the then White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, to pass on advice that Pence should \"call out all the electoral votes that he believes are unconstitutional as no electoral votes at all\".\n\nAfter the violence at the Capitol, Jordan was one of several members of Congress to whom the White House reached out to try to delay counting of electoral votes. He received five calls from Rudy Giuliani, one of Trump's closest allies, that night, according to the January 6 committee. The two men spoke at least twice that night. Jordan later said he spoke with Trump on January 6, but could not recall how many times.\n\nGiven his staunch efforts to spread misinformation, it wasn't much of a surprise that Jordan was one of 147 House Republicans who voted to overturn the election. He also signed on to an unsuccessful lawsuit Texas filed at the supreme court seeking to get electoral college votes thrown out in key battleground states.\n\nJordan has been one of the most prolific spreaders of misinformation about the election. Weeks before election day, Jordan accused Democrats of \"trying to steal\" the election. After election day, he continued to claim that something was amiss in Pennsylvania, one of the key states that swung the election for Biden and repeatedly and falsely tied mail-in voting to fraud. He quickly called for congressional investigations into claims of fraud and supported outlandish investigations by Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani into voting equipment.\n\nThe January 6 committee subpoenaed Jordan and four other congressmen after the group refused to voluntarily cooperate with the panel. Jordan refused to comply with that subpoena, calling it \"an unprecedented and inappropriate demand to examine the basis for a colleague's decision on a particular matter pending before the House of Representatives\". The committee referred Jordan to the ethics committee for investigation.\n\nBetween 1987 and 1995, Jordan served as an assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University. During that time, he worked alongside Richard Strauss, a team doctor who was accused of sexual abuse. A 2019 independent report commissioned by OSU concluded that Strauss \"sexually abused at least 177 male student-patients he was charged with treating as a university physician\".\n\nJordan has repeatedly denied any knowledge of Strauss's actions, but former wrestlers have attested that Jordan was directly informed of the doctor's misconduct. Earlier this month, four former OSU wrestlers publicly denounced Jordan, saying his inaction rendered him unqualified to become speaker of the House.\n\n\"Do you really want a guy in that job who chose not to stand up for his guys?\" the former OSU wrestler Mike Schyck told NBC News . \"Is that the kind of character trait you want for a House speaker?\"\n\nJohn Boehner, the former Republican House speaker, repeatedly criticized Jordan for pressuring Republican leadership to advance his hard-right agenda. Speaking to Politico Magazine in 2017 , Boehner described Jordan as a \"legislative terrorist\".\n\nJordan was part of a coalition of archconservative lawmakers that antagonized Bohener, repeatedly threatening to remove him from the speakership. Though they never followed through, the constant pressure and threats ultimately drove Boehner to early retirement.\n\n\"I just never saw a guy who spent more time tearing things apart - never building anything, never putting anything together,\" Boehner told CBS News in 2021.\n\nAccording to Vanderbilt University's Center for Effective Lawmaking , Jordan consistently ranks among Congress's least effective lawmakers. In the last Congress, Jordan ranked 217th out of 222 House Republicans.\n\nSince arriving in Congress 16 years ago, Jordan has played a central role in several of the most consequential government shutdowns. In an attempt to undermine Barack Obama's healthcare law, Jordan led the charge to shut down the government in 2013. It lasted 16 days and nearly drove the US to the brink of default.\n\nTwo years later, in 2015, he and his conservative allies in Congress used similar tactics, threatening a shutdown in an effort to defund Planned Parenthood, though an agreement was reached and a closure was averted in time.\n\nSign up to First Thing\n\nOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what's happening and why it matters\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nAgain in 2018, Jordan was one of the architects of the 2018 government shutdown that lasted 35 days, the longest in US history. Jordan urged Trump to shutter federal agencies in an attempt to force Congress to fund his border wall. It backfired and Congress and Trump eventually agreed to reopen the government without providing any funding for Trump's wall.\n\nCongress recently passed a stopgap funding measure, part of a deal the former speaker Kevin McCarthy struck with the support of Democrats to avert a government shutdown on his watch. The move enraged conservatives, who then moved to oust him.\n\nThe next speaker will have to move quickly to address federal funding, set to expire in mid-November, or again risk another shutdown.\n\nJordan has consistently voted against aid packages to assist Ukraine's war efforts against Russia, which have become a source of outrage among hard-right lawmakers.\n\nAs he launched his speakership bid earlier this month, Jordan told reporters that he was \"against\" providing more funding to Ukraine.\n\n\"The most pressing issue on Americans' minds is not Ukraine,\" he said. \"It is the border situation, and it's crime on the streets. And everybody knows that. So let's address those.\"\n\nForeign policy experts have warned that, without additional US aid, Ukraine's war efforts against Russia will falter and more Ukrainian citizens will die.\n\nAccording to the left-leaning group Media Matters , Jordan has appeared on Fox News at least 565 times since August 2017, making him the network's most frequently interviewed member of Congress.\n\nJordan has capitalized on those appearances by consistently touting the virtues of Trump, even as the former president faces 91 felony charges across four criminal cases.\n\n\"I am 100% for President Trump,\" Jordan told Fox News back in April. He added: \"No one has demonstrated that they will do what they said and get things done like he did.\"\n\nThat sycophancy has paid dividends, as Trump has now endorsed Jordan's speakership bid. Jordan has also used his Fox appearances to elevate his work, as chair of the House judiciary committee, to investigate Hunter Biden's business dealings and the justice department, accusing federal officials of giving the president's son \"preferential treatment\".\n\nJordan, an evangelical Christian, is a staunch abortion opponent. In fact, he has said the desire to restrict access to the procedure was one of the reasons he entered politics. On his congressional website, Jordan boasts that the first piece of legislation he ever co-sponsored was a bill that would extend protections to fetuses under the 14th amendment.\n\nHe also introduced a \"Life at Conception\" act that would ban all abortions nationally. After the supreme court overturned Roe v Wade, Jordan claimed on social media that the story of a 10-year-old Ohio girl who had to travel to Indiana to receive an abortion after being raped was \"another lie\". He later deleted the tweet after authorities charged a man in connection with the case and refused to apologize .\n\nAdditionally, he opposes same-sex marriage. According to his website, Jordan says he is \"committed to defending the sanctity of marriage and the family\" and \"oppose[s] all attempts to redefine marriage\"."

      "text": "Why do Republicans oppose Jim Jordan as speaker and what's next?\n\nFriday marked an escalation in House chaos as Jim Jordan lost his third vote to be House speaker and his status as nominee - how did we get here?\n\nEver since Republicans ousted Kevin McCarthy as House speaker on 3 October, the Republican conference has been mired in chaos. Friday marked an escalation as should be of that dysfunction as Jim Jordan, the far-right congressman from Ohio, lost his third vote on the House floor to be speaker and his status as the GOP nominee.\n\nHere's a look at what transpired this week:\n\nThere are currently 221 Republicans and 212 Democrats in the US House (there are two vacancies), giving the GOP a very slim majority. That means that any Republican who wants to be speaker has to have the support of nearly all of the Republicans in the House, something that is increasingly harder since individual members need less institutional support than they did in the past because of politically uncompetitive districts and the ability to raise huge sums of money online.\n\nWhen McCarthy negotiated himself into the speakership earlier this year, one of his key concessions was allowing any House member to file a motion to vacate, or remove him from speaker. Representative Matt Gaetz, a far-right Republican from Florida, filed such a motion earlier this month and enough Republicans - eight in total - voted against McCarthy to oust him.\n\nThat vacancy essentially brought the House to a standstill. The speaker runs the business of the House and controls the floor schedule and which bills come to the floor. Without one, the House cannot operate.\n\nAfter McCarthy's ouster, Steve Scalise of Louisiana and Jordan entered the speaker's race. Scalise won a private vote among the Republican conference, but withdrew his name from contention after it became clear he could not get enough votes.\n\nJordan, a far-right Ohio Republican who co-founded the House Freedom Caucus, earned the nomination to be the conference's next speaker on 13 October. He won the nomination with 124 of the House Republican conference's 221 votes. In order to become speaker he needed to get 217 votes from all house members.\n\nThings went from bad to worse when Jordan went to the House floor for formal votes on his speakership. On Tuesday, 20 Republicans voted against him, putting him far below the threshold he needed to be speaker. Twenty-two Republicans voted against him in a second vote on Wednesday. Twenty-five Republicans opposed him in a third vote, putting him even further from the speakership.\n\nAfter the third failed vote, Republicans took a vote by secret ballot on whether Jordan should remain the nominee. He lost that vote handily, losing his status as the Republican nominee for speaker.\n\nNew Republican candidates can now declare next week, when Republicans will start the process all over again.\n\nSeveral of the members who are opposed to Jordan are members of the House appropriations committee, who are reportedly opposed to the way Jordan has embraced a hard line on spending cuts and shutting down the government.\n\nMembers also reported receiving death threats and outside pressure to vote for Jordan, a position that has only hardened their opposition to him. \"The last thing you want to do is try to intimidate or pressure me, because then I close out entirely,\" Mario Diaz-Balart, a Florida Republican who opposes Jordan, told reporters earlier this week.\n\nThere is also reportedly bad blood over the way Jordan and his allies treated Steve Scalise. Scalise previously beat Jordan to win the conference's nomination to be speaker, but withdrew his bid after it became clear he couldn't get enough votes to win in the House. Some Scalise allies think Jordan didn't do enough to rally Republicans around Scalise.\n\nSign up to First Thing\n\nOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what's happening and why it matters\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\n\"He missed his moment of leadership when he failed Steve Scalise,\" John Rutherford, a Florida congressman who voted against Jordan, said earlier this week .\n\nNo one knows. Even as it was clear that Jordan had no clear path to becoming the speaker, no Republican emerged to seriously challenge him. Republicans currently have a Sunday noon deadline to announce their candidacy ahead of another round of speakership talks.\n\nAfter Republicans ousted Kevin McCarthy as speaker, Patrick McHenry, a North Carolina Republican, became the speaker pro tempore. McCarthy chose McHenry to take on that role should the speakership ever be declared vacant.\n\nThere has never been a similar situation , so it's unclear exactly what the scope of McHenry's power is. It has been widely understood to be extremely narrow so far, limited to the authority to oversee a vote for the next speaker. As Republicans stalled in picking a new speaker, there has been chatter about temporarily expanding McHenry's power so that the House can conduct some limited business. The majority of the GOP conference seems opposed to that kind of action.\n\nDemocrats have all voted for their leader, Hakeem Jeffries of New York, in each of the speakership elections. Jeffries has said there have been \"informal talks\" with Republicans, but Democrats have been quiet about any negotiations. A pre-condition for any Democratic support for a speaker appears to be that they would allow any bipartisan bills come up for a vote."

      "text": "Jim Jordan's dizzying fall bodes an even more broken Republican party to come\n\nWhile Trump hurtles to the Republican nomination, his party's representatives in Congress feud and backstab\n\nJ im Jordan's march to seize the Capitol began as a beer hall putsch but veered into Sesame Street. Vote after vote, he has missed the sagacity of the Count, the puppet Dracula who teaches children the number of the day. Former speaker Nancy Pelosi wryly remarked that the Republicans should \"take a lesson in mathematics and learning how to count\".\n\nAfter the second round, Jordan threw in the towel from his stool in the corner: no m ás! He endorsed instead extending the tenure and power of Patrick McHenry, the speaker pro tempore, until someone could figure something else out. But Jim Jordan the consensus builder was a short-lived phenomenon. The spirit of violence swirled around him.\n\nThe House Republicans held a closed conference to deliberate. The ghostly Kevin McCarthy, the late speaker, stood to create order, though it was unclear what that order would be or what authority he invoked. Matt Gaetz, his assassin, rose to answer him. \"Sit down!\" McCarthy shouted . Foul oaths flew back and forth. \"If you don't sit down, I'll put you down,\" Representative Mike Bost told Gaetz. Gaetz gestured for him to come and fight. But the one who suffered a TKO was McHenry.\n\nOnce again, Jordan had neglected to count. His followers did not follow him. \"It's the biggest F U to Republican voters I've ever seen,\" said Jordan's rabid advocate Representative Jim Banks. Another backer, Representative Scott Perry, Jordan's successor as chair of the far-right Freedom Caucus and a fellow co-conspirator in the January 6th plot, rejected the McHenry gambit out of hand. \"I'm going to stay with Mr Jordan to the end,\" he declared. The collapse came quickly, with McHenry declining the honor. \"If there is some goal to subvert the House rules to give me powers without a formal vote, I will not accept it,\" he said, as he too proclaimed his allegiance to Jordan while politely sideswiping him.\n\nOutside the paralyzed House, a gaggle of Never Trump, anti-Jordan Republicans conjectured about performing a magic trick. Would Senator Mitt Romney take the speakership? He had announced he was not running for re-election; he could sit in the Senate at the same time he presided over the House. But then there was the book about him by McKay Coppins of the Atlantic in which, in a final act of belated truth-telling, Romney flayed each and every Republican leader. And, anyway, why would he accept the nomination to preside in hell? What about Arnold Schwarzenegger? Would the former California governor, flogging his guide to life lessons, be willing to lift the dead weights of the House? The other possibilities for a deus ex machina were even less plausible. These scenarios were more fanciful than casting during the actors' strike.\n\nThe Democratic House leaders, who have a ringside seat to the Republican chaos, have long believed that Gaetz was always Jordan's cat's paw. After credulous pundits blamed the unity of the Democrats for the shambles of the Republicans, even attributing it to \"identity politics\", the Democratic leader, Hakeem Jeffries, offered the glimmer of a \"bipartisan\" coalition whenever breakaway Republicans would be willing to deal practically. But until the dawning of the Age of Aquarius the Democrats can do little but watch the Republicans' crash landings. Aid for Israel? Ukraine? Border security? The world crisis is secondary to the petty vindictiveness of Republican strife.\n\nFrom the start, Jordan's campaign counted on coercion. The Fox News host Sean Hannity made calls to recalcitrant members demanding to know why they were not in lockstep behind Jordan and urged his viewers to send angry messages to change hearts and minds. Steve Bannon, on his War Room podcast, instructed his listeners to target the office of Representative Steve Womack, who had not fallen into line. Gaetz, a guest on Bannon's program, excitedly announced that one notable holdout, Representative Mike D Rogers, had joined the \"Jordan train\".\n\n\"It seems as though Congressman Rogers has been sufficiently encouraged,\" boasted Gaetz about the efficacy of the threats. But this whip operation had its limits. When Representative Don Bacon voted for McCarthy, not Jordan, on the second ballot, the Fox News host Brian Kilmeade blurted on-air: \"Dumbass!\" We insult, you decide.\n\nAfter the McHenry debacle, Jordan leaped back in the ring. His Roberto Durán moment had passed. The threats were ratcheted up. Bacon's wife was inundated with menacing phone calls and texts. \"You're going to be fucking molested!\" said one voicemail. More than half a dozen members received death threats - \"credible death threats\", said Representative Mariannette Miller-Meeks. \"One thing I cannot stomach, or support, is a bully.\"\n\nRobocalls incited Republicans in their districts to call members, falsely claiming they were supporting Jeffries. Representative Carlos A Gimenez personally confronted Jordan. \"I told him, 'I don't really take well to threats. I really don't,'\" he said . \"Robocalls - they're not free. So somebody is actually funding this. And then he told me that he wasn't behind it and he's asked people to stop. But if you've asked people to stop it, why aren't they listening to you?\"\n\nAnother target, Representative John Rutherford, was skeptical of Jordan's denial. \"I think he's absolutely responsible for it,\" he said.\n\nJordan's reliance on threats disclosed his tried and true methods and their shortcoming. Since he has been in the House, he has not enacted a single piece of legislation. His raw rightwing partisanship has been unashamed, unapologetic and undisguised. McCarthy, who was genuinely shocked at the January 6th assault on the Capitol, reduced himself afterward to a beggar in the palace of Trump. Jordan was in the planning meetings of the coup all along. It was the logical trajectory of his political arc from his earliest days.\n\nJordan entered into the Ohio house in 1995 as the youngest member of the self-described \"Caveman Caucus\" that warred against moderate Republican governors as though they were socialists. His feud with the Republican speaker John Boehner of his home state, which ultimately resulted in Boehner's quitting in sheer exasperation, stemmed from Jordan's contempt. Boehner's view of him as a \"legislative terrorist\" was not the result of a newfound discovery about Jordan in Washington, but an insight he had already gained from his antagonism in Ohio. Boehner opposed him when he sought election to the state senate in 2000.\n\nJordan's concentrated malice, stripped of the jacket of respectability, has a purity that the older Republicans with their penchant for the occasional compromise and a drink lack. \"Politics has never been a place for sissies,\" Jordan told an Ohio sports journal more than a decade ago, when he was asked if politics had gotten nastier.\n\nElected to the House in 2006, he anticipated the Tea Party, which he subsumed as the natural successor to the \"Caveman Caucus\" but turbocharged with Koch brothers' money. Jordan's formation of the Freedom Caucus in 2015 was his new synthesis inside the House of the Tea Party, dark money and intimidation. He was waiting for Trump before Trump ever appeared on the horizon.\n\nAfter the Republicans won the House in 2022 by a slim margin, Jordan became chairman of the judiciary committee, although, despite graduating from the Capital University Law School of Columbus, Ohio, he curiously never passed the bar or practiced law. He created the Orwellian-named select subcommittee on the weaponization of the federal government essentially to harass the prosecutions of Donald Trump. When he demanded that the Fulton county district attorney, Fani Willis, turn over her evidence in the fake electors case in Georgia, she replied : \"A charitable explanation of your correspondence is that you are ignorant of the United States and Georgia constitutions and codes.\"\n\nThroughout his entire career Jordan himself has been under a cloud. Before he ever thought of running for the Ohio legislature, he was a star wrestler, recruited by his coach at the University of Wisconsin to be his assistant at the Ohio State University. The team doctor, Richard Strauss, whose locker was next to Jordan's, near the showers, sexually abused a documented 177 students, according to the school's official report, and OSU wound up paying more than $60m in settlements to about 300 people in all, while 200 suits are still pending.\n\nJordan has adamantly denied any knowledge of Strauss's crimes. Yet one of the wrestlers claimed he pleaded with him not to confirm the stories : \"Jim Jordan called me crying, crying ... begging me, crying for half an hour. That's the kind of cover-ups going on here.\" If it were to be shown that Jordan had even an inkling of the extraordinary sexual abuse his political career would be ended. \" Politics has never been a place for sissies .\" But the bully is often the coward.\n\nBefore the vote it was known in certain political circles in Washington two major journalistic investigations into Jordan's role in the wrestling scandal were being conducted. An HBO documentary produced by George Clooney and directed by Eva Orner (my colleague in the Oscar- and Emmy-winning documentary Taxi to the Dark Side) is far along in production. Throughout the speakership balloting a Washington Post story that had been filed as Jordan announced his candidacy was anxiously awaited. That investigation was at last published the day after Jordan dropped out. The Post would report that eight former wrestlers \"had clear recollections of team members protesting Strauss's conduct either directly to Jordan or within Jordan's range of hearing. All considered it inconceivable that Jordan did not know about Strauss's disturbing behaviors.\"\n\nJordan's grasp for the speakership was his bid finally to have it all. He would no longer be a man on the side or behind the curtain. He would walk over the bodies of McCarthy and Steve Scalise to turn the whole House into a giant weaponization subcommittee. But loyalty to him could not deliver the votes. Threats of violence to his adversaries escalated. His strong-arm tactics backfired. The intimidation offended and failed to force submission. Twice defeated, his inability to accept the humiliation he has inflicted on himself compelled him to humiliate himself a third time. He could not win in an open ballot and did strikingly worse in a closed one, losing among Republicans by a margin of 86 to 112. Matt Gaetz screamed to the heavens at Jordan's martyrdom: \"The most popular Republican in Congress was just knifed in an anonymous vote in a secret closed-door meeting in the basement of the Capitol.\"\n\nThe difference between the 147 Republicans who voted against certification of Joe Biden's election on the fateful night of January 6 and those same members who finally voted to reject Jordan is the mathematical measurement of the intimidation factor and its decline.\n\nJordan's abysmal failure has left the House Republicans to search for an inoffensive no-name alternative who by definition would lack the influence to move the party beyond its damage - \"insurmountable\" damage, said the ghost of Kevin McCarthy. \"I'm concerned about where we go from here.\" Several no-names threw in their hats. McCarthy endorsed the Republican whip, next in line, Tom Emmer. Bannon instantly dubbed him a \"Trump hater\", parading his expertise on hatred, and Trump slammed him for not supporting the January 6 coup.\n\nNo matter which Republican now accedes to the speakership that minor figure would not be able to maintain the discipline that Jeffries does among Democrats. Only when a majority of the whole House is allowed to bring a bill to the floor will regular order be restored. That would mean that a portion of the Republicans would ally with the Democrats as a majority to move most bills. Until then, the Hastert Rule, imposed by Republicans in the late 1990s, requiring a majority of the majority, in other words, a minority, will continue to serve the interests of extremist factions.\n\n\"Politics,\" wrote Henry Adams, descendant of two presidents, \"is the systematic organization of hatreds.\" Within the Republican party, that clever aphorism was turned into a strategy - the southern strategy, using race and resentment to realign the parties, a scheme laid out for the Nixon White House by the brilliant political analyst Kevin Phillips, who died this month.\n\nJim Jordan rose in the party shaped by Nixon and has gone farther and farther right since, well to the right of the Nixonian or even Reaganite party. What Jordan encountered of the old Republican party, he attempted to extirpate. His constant battle to destroy its remnants was the foundation of his career, antedating Trump by a decade, at last coming close to a central place of power with Trump's ascent. Jordan's fight for the speakership is the \"systematic organization of hatreds\" in a new key. It is a war fought within the Republican party, of Republicans against Republicans, a Hobbesian struggle fit for a champion wrestler, but that has ended with his ferocious movements exhausting him and leaving him pinned to the mat.\n\nThe Jordan flop is hardly the last match. It is not a singular or isolated event. The speakership battle is a function of the Trump candidacy. While Trump hurtles to the Republican nomination, campaigning courtroom by courtroom, gag order by gag order, Jordan's collapse is an augury of an even more broken party to come, of the collision of planets.\n\nSidney Blumenthal is the author of The Permanent Campaign, published in 1980, and All the Power of the Earth: The Political Life of Abraham Lincoln, 1856-1860, the third of a projected five volumes.

There is a deadline of Sunday at noon for candidates to announce interest in the speakership. The conference is expected to return on Monday evening to hear from candidates for the speakership, with voting set for Tuesday. By that time, the House will have been without a speaker for three weeks, hamstrung on conducting the work they were elected to do.\n\nSome moderates want to see a consensus candidate, while the far-right flank that ousted former speaker Kevin McCarthy previously said they would be \"prepared to accept censure, suspension or removal from the conference\" to get Jordan the speakership.\n\nA handful of Republican House members have either said they would seek the speakership or are considering the idea. Most prominent among them is Minnesota's Tom Emmer, currently the majority whip, the No 3 Republican in the chamber, who has McCarthy's backing. Others in the mix include Oklahoma's Kevin Hern, Georgia's Austin Scott, Florida's Byron Donalds, Louisiana's Mike Johnson and Michigan's Jack Bergman.\n\nIn the first floor vote of the speakership election, on Tuesday, 20 House Republicans opposed Jordan, leaving him far short of the 217 votes needed to capture the top job. Because of Republicans' razor-thin majority in the House, Jordan could only afford four defections within his conference and still ascend to the speakership.\n\nEven as Jordan tried to assuage moderates' concerns, a second floor vote held on Wednesday revealed that opposition had only grown, as 22 Republicans opposed Jordan's candidacy. By the third vote, on Friday, Jordan lost more support, with 25 House Republicans voting against him.\n\nAs long as the House remains without a speaker, the chamber cannot advance any legislation, leaving members unable to pass critical bills like a stopgap government funding measure or an aid package for Israel and Ukraine. Government funding is set to run out in less than a month, raising the threat of a federal shutdown next month.\n\nJordan's announcement came two weeks after the historic ouster of McCarthy, after eight House Republicans joined Democrats in supporting a motion to vacate the chair. Following McCarthy's removal, the House majority leader, Steve Scalise of Louisiana, initially won his conference's nomination for speaker, but he dropped out of the race last week due to entrenched opposition among hard-right lawmakers.\n\nSign up to First Thing\n\nOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what's happening and why it matters\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nAs of Friday, it remained unclear how Republicans could end the standoff and resume the business of the House. One idea floated by centrist Democrats and embraced by some of Jordan's critics involved expanding the powers of the acting speaker, the Republican Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, but the plan fizzled. Such a solution would raise serious constitutional questions, as the powers of an acting speaker are murky.\n\nWith Republicans embroiled in conflict, the House Democratic leader, Hakeem Jeffries of New York, has repeatedly called for the creation of a bipartisan governing coalition between Democrats and more moderate Republicans. Even Jordan's staunchest opponents have rejected the idea of teaming up with Democrats, although that could change if the House remains at a standstill.\n\nOn Friday, Jeffries, who has received the most votes in the speakership votes but would not be able to get enough support to take the spot since Democrats are in the minority, called on his Republican colleagues to get to work. \"Embrace bipartisanship and abandon extremism,\" Jeffries said."

He still has to answer for what happened to us.\"\n\nJordan, 59 and a founder of the hard-right Freedom Caucus, is competing for the speakership with Steve Scalise, the majority leader from Louisiana, after the historic ejection of Kevin McCarthy by disgruntled right-wingers last week. Jordan has secured the endorsement of Donald Trump, the presidential frontrunner whose supporters orchestrated McCarthy's defenestration.\n\nBefore entering politics, Jordan was an assistant OSU wrestling coach from 1986 to 1994. Former athletes have said he ignored rampant sexual abuse by Richard Strauss, a team doctor who died in 2005.\n\nJordan has long denied helping orchestrate a cover-up. On Tuesday, a spokesperson told NBC: \"Chairman Jordan never saw or heard of any abuse, and if he had, he would have dealt with it.\"\n\nBut Jordan also refused to co-operate with an official investigation which found Strauss's abuse was an \"open secret\", and that \"coaches, trainers and other team physicians were fully aware of Strauss' activities, and yet few seemed inclined to do anything to stop it\".\n\nAt one hearing, another former wrestler, Adam DiSabato, said: \"Jim Jordan called me crying, crying, groveling, on the Fourth of July ... begging me to go against my brother, begging me, crying for half an hour. That's the kind of cover-up that's going on here. He's a coward. He's a coward.\"\n\nYetts has previously said: \"If Jordan says he didn't know about it, then he's lying.\"\n\nSpeaking to NBC , another former wrestler, Rocky Ratliff, said Jordan \"abandoned his former wrestlers in the Ohio State sexual abuse scandal and cover-up\".\n\nAs the lingering scandal has not stopped Jordan in his political tracks, so it may not stop his attempt to be speaker. Last weekend, one of the rebels who voted out McCarthy, Nancy Mace of South Carolina, told CBS she supported Jordan for speaker. Mace also said she was \"not familiar or aware\" of the OSU scandal, adding: \"He's not indicted on anything that I'm aware of. I don't know anything and can't speak to that.\"\n\nSchyck told NBC he was himself a Republican, and Jordan \"was somebody I revered, somebody I looked up to.\n\n\"If early on he jumped in on our side and validated what we were saying, what everybody knew about what Dr Strauss was doing to us, then this wouldn't be happening. But he decided early on, for reasons I still don't understand, that he was going to deny knowing anything about this.\n\n\"Now he's got no choice but to stick to this story that he had no idea what Dr Strauss was doing, even though it's a lie.\"\n\nOSU has paid $60m to 296 victims of Strauss. Other lawsuits remain unresolved ."

      "text": "US House in chaos as Jordan schedules third vote and interim speaker plan fails\n\nRepublicans unable to break impasse as congressman vows to press on with a Friday vote despite opposition\n\nThe leaderless House was plunged deeper into chaos on Thursday after Republicans refused to coalesce around a speaker and a plan to empower an interim speaker collapsed.\n\nThe party's embattled candidate for speaker, congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio, vowed to press ahead, scheduling a long-delayed third vote on his nomination for Friday morning.\n\nBut angry and exhausted, the House Republican conference ended the day of fiery closed-door sessions no closer to breaking the impasse that has immobilized the chamber for a 17th day.\n\nJordan, a Donald Trump loyalist who led the congressional effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election and now chairs the House judiciary committee, has lost two consecutive votes to secure the speakership and did not appear to have the 217 votes he needs to win the gavel in a floor vote by Thursday evening.\n\nEarlier in the day, Jordan had briefly reversed course and backed a novel, bipartisan proposal to expand the authority of the temporary speaker, a position currently held by Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, for the next several months as Jordan worked to shore up support for his bid. But a group of hard-right conservatives revolted, calling the plan \"asinine\" and arguing that it would effectively cede control of the floor to Democrats.\n\nAs support for the idea crumbled, Jordan told reporters that he would continue to press ahead with his candidacy despite entrenched opposition from a widening group of members, some of whom accused the Ohio Republican of deploying intimidation tactics.\n\n\"We made the pitch to members on the resolution as a way to lower the temperature and get back to work,\" Jordan told reporters on Thursday. \"We decided that wasn't where we're gonna go. I'm still running for speaker and I plan to go the floor and get the votes and win this race.\"\n\nBehind closed doors, tensions flared.\n\n\"Temperatures are pretty high,\" congressman Mike Gallagher, a Wisconsin Republican, told reporters as he left a conference-wide meeting on Thursday. He said he was headed to the chapel to pray for some \"divine guidance\".\n\nDuring one session, Kevin McCarthy, the ousted former speaker, clashed with Florida congressman Matt Gaetz , who led the push to remove him earlier this month. Gaetz rose to speak and McCarthy told him to sit down.\n\nAsked about the exchange, McCarthy said: \"The whole country I think would scream at Matt Gaetz right now.\"\n\nThe dramatic saga to elect a new speaker began earlier this month with the unprecedented ousting of McCarthy, a move backed by eight far-right Republicans after he relied on Democrats to pass legislation that would fund the government and avert a shutdown.\n\nIn a secret ballot, the Republican conference initially nominated congressman Steve Scalise to replace McCarthy, choosing the No 2 House Republican over Jordan, a founding member of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus. But Scalise abruptly withdrew when Jordan's far-right allies refused to coalesce around him.\n\nJordan, the runner-up, then emerged as the party's second choice to be speaker. But his candidacy ran headlong into opposition from more mainstream members wary of elevating a political flamethrower and Trump loyalist to a position that is second in line to the presidency. Wars raging in Ukraine and Israel and a government funding deadline looming had Republicans desperate to move forward.\n\nWith the majority party deadlocked, a bipartisan group of lawmakers began to explore the possibility of expanding the powers of the acting speaker, McHenry, thereby allowing the chamber to take up urgent legislation.\n\nMcHenry assumed the position of speaker pro tempore under a House rule put in place after the September 11 terrorist attacks. It requires a speaker to draw up a confidential list of lawmakers who would temporarily assume the job in the event the speaker's chair should become vacant. When McCarthy was ousted, the House learned that McHenry, a close ally of the former speaker, was at the top of that list.\n\nMcHenry has waived off calls to expand his power, indicating that he views the role as limited to presiding over the election of the next speaker. But McCarthy told reporters on Thursday that he believes McHenry already has the authority to conduct legislative business.\n\nSign up to First Thing\n\nOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what's happening and why it matters\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\n\"It's about the continuity of government,\" McCarthy said. \"I always believed the names I was putting on the list could carry out and keep government running until you elect a new speaker.\"\n\nBut several conservatives decried the effort to install a temporary speaker, preferring Jordan plow ahead with more votes. After all, they argue, it took McCarthy 15 ballots to be elected speaker in January.\n\n\"This is the biggest FU to Republican voters I've ever seen,\" said congressman Jim Banks, a Republican from Indiana.\n\nThe cast of rebels who oppose Jordan now are a mix of political moderates and institutional pragmatists with deep reservations about the Ohio Republican's approach to governance. Some hail from districts that Joe Biden won in 2020, where Jordan's brand of far-right conservatism is unpopular. Several were wary of handing the gavel to a lawmaker the former Republican speaker John Boehner once called a \"legislative terrorist\".\n\nOne conservative lawmaker, Colorado congressman Ken Buck, who was among the hard-right faction that voted to oust McCarthy, said he would not support Jordan because Jordan still refused to accept Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nJordan's allies on Capitol Hill and in conservative media have waged an aggressive pressure campaign for votes that some lawmakers said included harassing messages and threats of a primary challenge. The calculation was that Jordan's more mainstream critics would eventually relent and fall in line behind him. But his hardball tactics backfired, those lawmakers said.\n\n\"One thing I cannot stomach or support is a bully,\" said congresswoman Mariannette Miller-Meeks, an Iowa Republican, who initially voted for Jordan and then opposed on a second ballot after she said in a statement that she had received \"credible death threats and a barrage of threatening calls\".\n\nOn Thursday afternoon Jordan attempted a reset, huddling once again with a group of holdouts, some of whom have vowed to block him from ever claiming the gavel.\n\nBut progress eluded him. After the meeting, congressman Mike Lawler, a New York Republican opposed to Jordan, called for the conference to reinstate McCarthy or empower McHenry.\n\n\"We must prove to the American people that we can govern effectively and responsibly or, in 15 months, we'll be debating who the minority leader is and preparing for Joe Biden's second inaugural,\" he said."

      "text": "Speaker fiasco lays bare ungovernable dysfunction of House Republicans\n\nOne branch of US government has ground to a halt amid death threats and screaming matches as Republicans fail to unite around a candidate for speaker\n\nD eath threats. Screaming matches behind closed doors. A futile cycle of votes that put internecine warfare on full public display. The Republican party this week sank into new depths of disarray and dysfunction - with no remedy in sight.\n\nNever before has America gone so long without a speaker of the House of Representatives and, critics say, not for a very long time has a major party appeared so broken. It has left a branch of the US government leaderless at an extraordinary moment of peril in the Middle East and Ukraine.\n\n\"When you look at the damage to the party's image, its reputation, its ability to do anything substantive or serious, this is a week of unmitigated disaster for the Republican party,\" said Rick Wilson , co-founder of the Lincoln Project, a pro-democracy and anti-Trump group.\n\nThe latest setback came on Friday when Jim Jordan, a rightwing Ohio congressman endorsed by former president Donald Trump, lost a third vote to become speaker and was then unceremoniously dumped by Republicans as their nominee. The majority leader, Steve Scalise, said they were going to \"come back and start over\" on Monday.\n\nThis followed a week of turmoil remarkable even by the fractious standards of the Trump era, with ideological disagreements merging with personal vendettas in a combustible mix. After Kevin McCarthy was ousted on 3 October and Scalise failed to garner enough backing, Jordan, a bare knuckle rightwinger and election denier, had made an unlikely effort to unite the party.\n\nIn the first floor vote on Tuesday, the House Republican conference chair, Elise Stefanik, formally nominated Jordan and aimed high by quoting the Bible (Esther 4:14) to claim that Jordan would be America's speaker \"for such a time as this \". But 20 Republicans holdouts denied him the gavel.\n\nA day later, Jordan tried again but this time 22 Republicans opposed him. There was a sense of absurdity as some called out alternative names such as John Boehner, a former speaker who quit eight years ago.\n\nMeanwhile it emerged that Jordan's allies in the \"Make America great again\" (Maga) movement had deployed a hardball pressure campaign. Every member who voted against him said they had received a barrage of angry phone calls and messages.\n\nCongressman Don Bacon said he received death threats and his wife slept with a loaded gun near her bedside one night. Others said their families had been threatened - indicative of dangerously violent undercurrents in American politics that Trump's recent rhetoric has only encouraged.\n\nBut the intimidation tactics had the opposite effect of that intended by hardening the resolve of the holdouts. Congressman Drew Ferguson said the death threats against his family were \"unacceptable, unforgivable and will never be tolerated\". Congresswoman Mariannette Miller-Meeks added : \"One thing I cannot stomach or support is a bully.\"\n\nOn Thursday, tragedy turned to farce. Jordan agreed to suspend his campaign in favor of a resolution that would temporarily expand the powers of the acting speaker, Patrick McHenry, to get the House moving again. But that went down like a lead balloon at a closed-door meeting of Republicans where tempers flared.\n\nMcCarthy yelled at Matt Gaetz, the Florida congressman behind his ousting, when Gaetz tried to seize a microphone. The former speaker explained to reporters later: \"I told him to sit down, and he sat down. I think the entire conference screamed at him. Listen, the whole country, I think, would scream at Matt Gaetz right now.\"\n\nAfter the meeting, Jordan announced that the McHenry plan would be scrapped and that he would fight on after all. \"I'm still running for speaker,\" he declared. \"I plan to go to the floor and get the votes and win this race.\" But on Friday the opposition grew to 25 Republicans, an election result that not even Jordan could deny.\n\nSoon after he lost the party nomination in a secret ballot, putting Republicans back to square one. Critics saw it as the awful spectacle of a party - held together by the glue of grievance, \"owning the libs\" and a cult of personality - coming apart at the seams.\n\nKurt Bardella , a Democratic strategist, said: \"We are seeing the inevitable outcome of years of neglect, years of lack of leadership, years of lack of courage culminate with what is a completely ungovernable and dysfunctional Republican party. The fact that there isn't a single Republican right now who can get 217 votes is illustrative of deep schisms within the party and these deep wounds that there is no healing from.\"\n\nBardella, a former spokesperson and senior adviser for Republicans on the House oversight committee, added: \"Time and again the bad actors in the Republican party have been rewarded for their bad behavior. They get rewarded with television time. They get rewarded with raising millions of dollars in contributions.\n\n\"They get rewarded with plum committee assignments. Whether it's Jordan or a Matt Gaetz or Marjorie Taylor Greene, who time and again we're told represent the fringe of the party, they continue to be elevated and empowered by the leadership that's in charge.\"\n\nNow ending its third week without a leader, the House cannot act on a $106bn national security package unveiled by Joe Biden on Friday that would bolster US border security and send aid to Israel and Ukraine. Congress also faces a 17 November deadline to pass funding to keep the government open.\n\nJeffries has said Democrats are \"ready, willing and able\" to partner with centrist Republicans on a path to reopen the House. In the meantime the chaos should, in theory, present a campaign gift to Democrats in next year's elections, contrasting Biden's steady wartime leadership with a party at war with itself.\n\nWendy Schiller , a political scientist at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, said: \"It's a slow drip. People are still going to work and living their lives so they're not worried about it. But independent voters who have been uncomfortable with the very right wing of the Republican party, whether it's Trump or anybody else, will get more uncomfortable because this is threatening the stability of the federal government to function at all.\n\n\"It's one thing to be chaotic if you're Trump - but it's another to not be able to pass any legislation at all. \""

      "text": "Jim Jordan emerges as House speaker nominee but doesn't have votes to win\n\nCongressman, endorsed by Trump and McCarthy, defeated surprise candidate Austin Scott, who had barely campaigned\n\nRepublicans in the US House of Representatives scrambled to find a new speaker on Friday as Congressman Jim Jordan won an internal vote but with a margin that suggests the disarray is far from over.\n\nJordan, endorsed by former president Donald Trump and ex-speaker Kevin McCarthy, defeated a surprise candidate, Austin Scott of Georgia, who had barely campaigned.\n\nAccording to media reports, Jordan's won by 124 votes to 81, meaning that he gained only 25 votes since his defeat by Steve Scalise in a previous contest. Scalise subsequently abandoned his bid after failing to secure enough support for a floor vote. It remains far from certain whether Jordan can avoid a similar fate.\n\nJordan did not pick up much more support in a second round of voting, which he won 152-55, indicating that about a quarter of the conference would oppose him in a floor vote expected on Tuesday at the earliest. Jordan cannot expect help from Democrats who condemned him as an \"extremist extraordinaire\" and warned that his nomination would solve nothing. Hakeem Jeffries, the minority leader, said: \"The House Republican civil war continues to rage on, miring the Congress in chaos, dysfunction and extremism. House Republicans have chosen to triple down on the chaos, triple down on the dysfunction and triple down on the extremism. \"House Republicans have selected as their nominee to be the speaker of the people's house the chairman of the 'chaos caucus', a defender in a dangerous way of dysfunction and an extremist extraordinaire.\"\n\nWithout a speaker, the House has been paralyzed for 10 days, unable to take up legislation including approving aid for Israel following the attacks by Hamas, a priority for many Republicans.\n\nScalise, from Louisiana, announced his decision to drop out on Thursday, following a meeting in which it became clear he had no path to securing the 217 votes any winner would need.\n\n\"There are still some people that have their own agendas,\" Scalise said. \"And I was very clear: we have to have everybody put their agendas on the side and focus on what this country needs. This country is counting on us to come back together. This House of Representatives needs a speaker, and we need to open up the House again.\"\n\nThe conference met again on Friday morning, seeking to determine whether Ohio congressman Jordan, 59, the judiciary committee chair, a hard-right bomb-thrower and a leading supporter of Trump, the presidential frontrunner, could cobble together enough votes to become speaker.\n\nHe prevailed but must now seek the votes of 217 members of the full House, including Democrats, in a vote on the floor. Among those he will have to win over is Scalise ally Ann Wagner of Missouri, who told CNN on Thursday she was a \"non-starter\" on Jordan.\n\nJordan is a founding member of the House Freedom Caucus. He was a key Trump ally before and after the January 6 insurrection who refused to cooperate with the House panel that investigated the attack. Liz Cheney, a former Wyoming congresswoman from an influential Republican family, had suggested the conference would make a dangerous mistake if it elected Jordan.\n\n\"Jim Jordan was involved in Trump's conspiracy to steal the election and seize power; he urged that [then vice-president Mike] Pence refuse to count lawful electoral votes,\" Cheney, who was vice-chair of the January 6 committee, said on social media. \"If [Republicans] nominate Jordan to be speaker, they will be abandoning the constitution. They'll lose the House majority and they'll deserve to.\"\n\nScott, 53 and the longest-serving House Republican from Georgia, if with a strikingly low profile in Washington, offered himself as a relatively moderate alternative to Jordan. \"We are in Washington to legislate, and I want to lead a House that functions in the best interest of the American people,\" he wrote on social media.\n\nIn January 2021, in the aftermath of the deadly attack on Congress by Trump supporters, Scott was not among the 139 House Republicans (and eight senators) who voted to overturn Joe Biden's election victory.\n\nHe also rejected the move to eject Kevin McCarthy last week, dismissing the eight Republicans who made their own speaker the first ever removed from the role by his own party as \"grifters\" working \"in the name of their own glory and fundraising\".\n\nElsewhere on Friday, Mike Johnson of Louisiana, widely thought a possible candidate, ruled himself out of the running - \"after much prayer and deliberation\". According to CNN another name widely touted in the corridors of Capitol Hill, Tom Emmer of Minnesota, was planning to stay as majority whip but could mount a challenge if Jordan could not muster the votes.\n\nAs Republicans hold the House by a razor-thin majority, any candidate for speaker can only afford four defections if they are to win the gavel.\n\nBrian Mast, from Florida, acknowledged that Scalise's downfall so soon after that of McCarthy had created bad blood in the party.\n\n\"One of the obstacles is simply the fact that Kevin got thrown out [and] Steve wasn't able to come to the floor,\" Mast said. \"Just that being the case, there's going to be people that are upset and ... possibly want to take it out on Jim just because that happened.\"\n\nPatrick McHenry of North Carolina continues to serve as temporary speaker but his limited powers have left the chamber unable to work. Michael McCaul of Texas, the chair of the foreign relations committee, warned that the standoff was sending the wrong message to foreign powers such as Russia and China.\n\n\"It's a dangerous game that we're playing,\" McCaul said. \"It just proves our adversaries right that democracy doesn't work. Our adversaries are watching us.\"\n\nJeffries, of New York, continued to call on moderate Republicans to \"break with the extremists\" and form a bipartisan coalition.\n\n\"We are ready, willing and able to do so,\" Jeffries told PBS. \"I know there are traditional Republicans who are good women and men who want to see government function but they are unable to do it within the ranks of their own conference, which is dominated by the extremist wing, and that's why we continue to extend the hand of bipartisanship to them.\"\n\nRepublicans have shown no sign of entertaining that idea. Despite the chaos, though, some chose to laugh at their own mismanagement.\n\nMike Collins, of Georgia, said : \"The good thing is, at the rate we're going, I should have my turn [to try to get] 217 [votes] by Halloween. Plenty of time to get my flyers ready.\""

      "text": "CNN Gets Election Skeptic Jim Jordan To Admit 2024 Race Was 'Free And Fair'\n\nSenior Reporter\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) just got put on the spot about why he only cried foul over election fraud when his candidate was on the losing end of the vote.\n\nDuring a stop by CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday , moderator Dana Bash pressed the congressman to explain why he was taking the results of the 2024 race at face value when he was such a staunch critic of what went down during the 2020 election between Donald Trump and Joe Biden .\n\n\"I haven't seen you or your colleagues claiming any election irregularities, no rampant voting fraud this time,\" Bash pointed out. \"It seems to me that Republicans claim voting fraud and election integrity when you lose and not when you win.\"\n\nInstead of addressing Bash's concern, Jordan talked up Trump's political chops while calling the Republican's 2024 win the \"greatest political comeback we've ever seen.\"\n\nAs the congressman went on about the contrast between Trump and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris ' campaign, Bash pushed Jordan to answer why his party's persistent voter fraud accusations appeared to evaporate after their camp emerged victorious on Tuesday.\n\n\"Last time around, it wasn't so much about the policy differences or personality differences. There were false claims about election fraud when Donald Trump lost,\" she said. \"This time Donald Trump won and you think the election was free and fair. You see there's a little bit of a [difference]?\"\n\nDANA BASH: It seems to me that Republicans claim voting fraud when you lose and not when you win. JIM JORDAN: No. This election was the greatest political comeback we've ever seen. BASH: Why was 2024 different from 2020 when Trump lost? JORDAN: There were concerns about 2020... pic.twitter.com/9UFZZwRdp5\n\n\"I think the Democrats got to ask, 'Why did we go from getting 81 million to getting 70 million?'\" Jordan replied. \"What happened to those 10 million people? Maybe it's not smart to run an election where you have no vision, no record to run.\"\n\nTrying to put campaign strategies aside, Bash again asked Jordan, \"Do you believe the 2024 election was free and fair?\"\n\nAll but backed into a corner, the Ohio politician admitted, \"I do. I do.\"\n\n\"Why was it different from 2020 when he lost? Is that the only difference?\" Bash then wondered.\n\nWhen Jordan cited concerns about mail-in voting, Bash reminded him that any claims of widespread election malfeasance had been thoroughly and repeatedly debunked.\n\nContinuing to avoid the question, the congressman knocked Democrats for having \"no vision\" and just wanting to \"call everyone names\" this election cycle.\n\nRealizing Jordan wasn't going to give a straight answer, Bash wrapped the interview by telling viewers that there was \"no evidence of widespread fraud in 2020.\"\n\nWhile Jordan wasn't questioning the integrity of the 2024 election now, his party's candidate did try to prime his supporters to challenge the voting process prior to his decisive win on Tuesday night.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Jim Jordan Admits An Election Loss\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nWASHINGTON - After failing to win the speaker's gavel in a House floor vote for the third time, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) on Friday asked his GOP colleagues if he should keep trying.\n\nVoting by secret ballot in the Capitol basement, Republicans told Jordan no by a vote of 112 to 86. And that was that.\n\n\"Rep. Jordan stated before the vote that he would accept the will of the conference and so he was gracious, as we expected him to be, in accepting the results,\" Rep. Kat Cammack (R-Fla.) told reporters.\n\nAdmitting defeat is not easy for Jordan. His speaker bid failed by increasingly wide margins across the three House votes this week, but he was poised to keep trying, with his allies at one point suggesting a marathon of votes designed to break the will of his opponents over the course of the weekend.\n\nAnd Jordan has never acknowledged that his preferred candidate for president in 2020, Donald Trump, lost to Joe Biden by 7 million votes.\n\nOn Friday morning, a reporter asked Jordan if the 2020 election had been stolen. There is no evidence that fraud or irregularities swayed the result - a finding reaffirmed by forensic audits and court case after court case at the time - but Jordan said otherwise.\n\n\"I think there were all kinds of problems with the 2020 election,\" he said.\n\nThe refusal to accept Trump's defeat helps explain Republicans' predicament in the House of Representatives, which has had no speaker for the past 18 days thanks to a far-right faction that operates as if Democrats have no rightful role in governance.\n\nWithout a speaker, the House can't even pass a symbolic resolution, much less consider legislation to keep the government open or send aid to Israel, Ukraine or the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nRestive right-wingers took the speaker's gavel from Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calf.) after he committed an act of bipartisanship: preventing a government shutdown by allowing a vote on a government funding bill that passed with 209 Democrats and 126 Republicans in support. For the far-right, working with Democrats is forbidden - even if the alternative means shutting down federal agencies or the House.\n\nThis week, Jordan proposed reopening the chamber for legislative business by allowing a temporary speaker to move legislation. Several Democrats voiced support for the idea, raising the prospect of the House functioning with a bipartisan coalition, but right-wingers recoiled.\n\nRep. Troy Nehls (R-Texas), for instance, called the idea of sharing power with Democrats \"sickening, quite honestly.\"\n\nNehls and other Republicans say that because they control the House, the chamber should only pass bills with Republican votes. It doesn't matter that Democrats control the Senate and the White House, meaning any bill that gets signed into law will have to be bipartisan. Instead, the far-right faction imagines that the Senate and president must bend to their will, as though Democrats have no legitimate say in the legislative process - an echo of Trump's insistence that Biden is an illegitimate president.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) described the imperative for Republican-only legislation when he announced his intent to trigger a snap referendum on McCarthy earlier this month: \"You cannot use Democrats to roll a majority of the majority.\"\n\nIn a small way, Jordan's refusal to disavow Trump's election lies hurt him in his quest for the speaker's gavel. One of the 25 Republicans who voted against him in his third attempt this week, Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.), demanded that Jordan admit Biden won in 2020, which Jordan wouldn't do. That's why a reporter asked Jordan about it again Friday.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "House GOP 'Back To The Drawing Board' After Jim Jordan's Exit From Speaker Race\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nPolitics Reporter, HuffPost\n\nWASHINGTON ― House Republicans hit the reset button on their search for a new House speaker and will try again next week to find a leader, after Rep. Jim Jordan 's (R-Ohio) bid came to a whimpering end Friday.\n\nRepublicans voted against keeping Jordan as their speaker-designee by a margin of 86 to 112, lawmakers told reporters after their meeting in the Capitol basement. Jordan then accepted the result.\n\n\"We put the question to them. They made a different decision. I told the conference that I appreciated getting to work with everyone, talking to everyone,\" Jordan told reporters after the vote.\n\n\"Unfortunately, Jim is no longer going to be the nominee,\" Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told reporters. \"We will have to go back to the drawing board.\"\n\nThe clean slate brought out a plethora of announced and potential candidates for the speaker post, which can be won by wrangling 217 votes from the 221-member House Republican conference.\n\nRep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), who as party whip is the third-ranking leader, is reportedly running . Emmer would likely be the front-runner, having helped flip control of the chamber back to Republicans as head of the National Republican Congressional Committee in 2020 and 2022.\n\nRepublicans have had no leader since chucking McCarthy out of the speaker's suite earlier this month because he'd been overly cooperative with Democrats .\n\nAll House business has ceased as Republicans try to find a replacement for McCarthy, but they've been unable to agree among themselves after first nominating Rep. Steve Scalise (R-La.) and then Jordan.\n\nAt least 20 Republicans voted against Jordan on the House floor three separate times this week, depriving him of the required 217 votes. Jordan received only 194 votes Friday in his third attempt.\n\nJordan had told HuffPost before the secret ballot among Republicans on Friday that he intended to keep trying to win his colleagues over. He said he had lost his most recent House floor vote by a smaller margin than some people expected.\n\nHouse members headed home for the weekend.\n\n\"Monday, we're going to come back and start over,\" Scalise told reporters.\n\nNow Republicans will go back to the beginning of the process. A candidate forum is set for Monday evening and a series of votes is set for Tuesday.\n\nWith Jordan and McCarthy off the table, the list of actual and potential speaker candidates is long.\n\nIn addition to Emmer, Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) - who won a few floor votes for speaker in January, when McCarthy took 15 rounds to lock down the speakership - has tossed his hat in the ring .\n\nRep. Austin Scott (R-Ga.), who ran as token opposition in the party vote that originally made Jordan the speaker-designee, is running again .\n\nAnother candidate is Rep. Kevin Hern (R-Okla.), who chairs the Republican Study Committee, the House GOP's biggest intraparty group. If successful, he would be the first Oklahoman to hold the speakership since Carl Albert, the so-called Little Giant.\n\nRep. Pete Sessions (R-Texas), a former Rules Committee chair, has also said he is running , as has Rep. Jack Bergman (R-Mich.).\n\nOthers who are potential candidates or said to be informally testing the waters for a run include Rep. Mike Johnson (R-La.), as well as Texas Republicans Roger Williams and Jodey Arrington. Williams heads up the Small Business Committee, while Arrington is chair of the Budget Committee.\n\nRep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), the popular chair of the House Rules Committee, has seen his name bandied about, but he has insisted that he is not interested in the job.\n\nOne name that won't be in the mix is McCarthy's, despite the Californian getting two floor votes for speaker Friday and many in the conference remaining bitter about his ouster. He's thrown his support behind Emmer.\n\nMcCarthy told reporters Friday that the group of eight Republicans who made his ouster possible had done \"insurmountable\" damage to the country.\n\n\"I've never seen this amount of damage done [from] just a few people for their own personalities, for their own fear of what's going through,\" McCarthy said.\n\n\"I'm concerned about where we go from here.\"\n\nOver the now two and a half weeks of the impasse, House Democrats have stuck with their leader, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), and been content to watch the Republicans struggle.\n\n\"The American public wants responsible leaders focused on governing, growing our economy, and strengthening our national security,\" said Viet Shelton, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. \"Instead, House Republicans are giving them chaos, dysfunction, and the [Make America Great Again] Hunger Games of 2023.\"\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Jim Jordan Sheds Even More Votes On Third Try To Become Speaker\n\nPolitics Reporter, HuffPost\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) saw the House of Representatives again reject his bid to become speaker on Friday ― this time by the biggest margin yet, after some of his fellow Republicans said they'd received threats after voting against him in earlier rounds.\n\nJordan garnered only 194 votes from House Republicans, down from 200 in his first attempt and 199 in his second vote Wednesday. All of those are well short of the 217 needed to win when all representatives vote.\n\nJordan showed no signs he was withdrawing soon, telling HuffPost after the vote he was going to \"keep talking, listening to colleagues, going to conference.\"\n\nSeveral House Republicans have complained that their offices have been inundated with calls from Jordan supporters as part of a pressure campaign on his behalf. Some who have voted against Jordan say they or their families have been subject to outright threats.\n\nRep. Don Bacon (R-Neb.) said his wife slept with a gun beside her bed one night in response to threats made since Bacon became one of Jordan's most prominent opponents.\n\nJordan denied blame for the incidents.\n\n\"I've done everything I can. I've put out statements. I've said this is wrong,\" he said.\n\nBut the incidents have clearly taken a toll on his votes.\n\nRep. Carlos Gimenez (R-Fla.), who voted for former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) in Friday's balloting, said the votes against Jordan were likely to grow.\n\n\"Twenty-two are really solid. We picked up another three,\" he said. \"I think more people are going to come around and say, 'You've had your chance, let's go, let's move on.'\"\n\n\"Some people are getting threats against their wives and children and all that. It's getting very offensive,\" Gimenez said. \"It used to be that I was voting for McCarthy. Now I'm not voting for Jim Jordan.\"\n\nThe House has been without a speaker since Oct. 3, when eight Republicans joined with House Democrats to oust McCarthy from the post.\n\nSince then, Republicans have considered trying to reinstall McCarthy; nominated Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.), only to see him withdraw; and put forward Jordan, who appeared undaunted Friday morning at the prospect of calling for votes again and again until he won.\n\n\"Look, there's been multiple rounds of votes for speaker before. We all know that,\" Jordan said at a press conference Friday morning. \"I just know that we need to get a speaker as soon as possible so we can get to work for the American people.\"\n\nMembers of the group of eight Republicans who voted to oust McCarthy said they were willing to be sanctioned by the House Republican conference if it meant Jordan would win enough votes to become speaker.\n\n\"If what people need is to see the eight of us rapped on the knuckles in order to get on to the business of governing, what we're saying is we're open-minded to that,\" said Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), who led the effort to topple McCarthy.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Frank Church during a session of the Senate Intelligence Committee on the CIA in 1975. Photo: Bettmann Archive In one of their very first steps since taking over the House of Representatives, House Republicans have created a special new panel to launch wide-ranging investigations into what they allege are the ways in which the federal government has abused the rights of conservatives.\n\nSen. Frank Church during a session of the Senate Intelligence Committee on the CIA in 1975.\n\nBut Republicans and right-wing pundits have already given up on its clumsy formal title - the \" Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government \" - and are now simply calling it the new \"Church Committee.\" By doing so, they are explicitly comparing it to the historic Church Committee of the mid-1970s, which conducted landmark investigations of the CIA, the FBI, the National Security Agency, and the rest of the intelligence community, none of which had previously been subject to real oversight.\n\nThe new \"weaponization\" subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee will be chaired by Rep. Jim Jordan, a right-wing ally of former President Donald Trump, and has a much different objective than the original Church Committee: The panel is widely expected to become a pro-Trump star chamber, investigating the officials and organizations that have previously investigated Trump, including the FBI and the Justice Department.\n\nWe're independent of corporate interests - and powered by members.

Kevin McCarthy during McCarthy's marathon bid to become House speaker last week, is now being rewarded with the mandate and resources to conduct investigations into almost any corner of the government he chooses; those probes have the potential to make the Biden administration look bad or Trump look good. McCarthy has even authorized the subcommittee to examine ongoing criminal investigations, which the Justice Department will certainly oppose.\n\nBy calling their panel the new Church Committee, Jordan and the Republicans are trying to assume the mantle of one of the most iconic investigative committees in congressional history. (I've spent the last several years researching and writing a book about Sen. Frank Church and his eponymous panel, which will be published in May.)\n\n\"When you reach back in history and bring a phrase from the past to the present, you get to carry a meaning into contemporary time,\" observed Stephanie Martin, the Frank and Bethine Church Endowed Chair of Public Affairs at Boise State University in Idaho, the native state of Sen. Church, the Democrat who chaired the original Church Committee. \"By calling it the Church Committee,\" she added, Republicans are appropriating the image \"of effective change and effective oversight.\"\n\nJordan and the Republicans are trying to assume the mantle of one of the most iconic investigative committees in congressional history.\n\nBut the differences between the Church Committee and Jordan's new subcommittee are stark, observes Loch Johnson, who served as an aide to Church on the committee and later wrote a firsthand account of the committee's work. \"The Church Committee was strongly oriented toward following the documentary evidence that we were able to uncover,\" said Johnson. \"The inquiry was driven not by ideology, revenge, or anything else but the facts.\" Today's Republicans, he added, seem \"motivated by ideology and a sense of grievance, starting with the 'stolen election' of 2020.\"\n\nJohnson and others argue that what the Republicans are creating is unlikely to be anything like the Church Committee, especially if, as seems almost certain, it descends into conspiracy theories about a mythical \"deep state\" that is out to get Trump and conservatives.\n\nThe existence of an anti-Trump \"deep state\" has become one of the most persistent conspiracy theories on the right and feeds into the anger and resentment against the government held by pro-Trump forces, including Jordan. Like all powerful and lasting conspiracy theories, it relies on some basic facts - but then turns reality on its head to reach a fantastical conclusion.\n\nIt is true that America is burdened with a sprawling and ever-growing military-industrial complex built on a network of relationships linking the Pentagon; the CIA; Homeland Security; defense, intelligence, and counterterrorism contractors; and many others in a powerful and partially hidden web that, over the past few decades, has pushed the nation into a period of nearly endless war. The traditional post-World War II military-industrial complex grew steadily for decades despite President Dwight Eisenhower's famous warning about its rising power in his 1961 farewell address : \"In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.\" Its power expanded exponentially after the September 11 attacks as counterterrorism and homeland security became big businesses, making it far more difficult for the United States to ever reduce its paranoia over the threat of terrorism.\n\nBut today's combined military, intelligence, and counterterrorism complex is a capitalistic, pro-military center of gravity in American society. It is not anti-Trump or anti-conservative, and it is definitely not a secret political organization bent on imposing \"woke\" views on Americans.\n\nIn fact, it was the work of the Church Committee that helped ensure that the \"deep state\" is nothing more than a right-wing conspiracy theory today. In the first three decades after World War II, the U.S. intelligence community faced no real oversight or outside scrutiny, and as a result, the CIA, the FBI, and the NSA grew beyond presidents' ability to control and became increasingly lawless. The reforms created as a result of the Church Committee helped to bring the intelligence community fully under the rule of law for the first time. By disclosing a series of shocking abuses of power, Church and his committee created rules of the road for the intelligence community that largely remain in place today.\n\nThe Church Committee's work represented a watershed moment in American history - which is why Republicans are now so eager to co-opt its name. But there is no evidence that Jordan plans to follow the earlier panel's serious and comprehensive approach. In fact, the involvement of Jordan and other House Republicans in Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election already constitutes an obvious conflict of interest. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the New York Democrat who is now House minority leader, tweeted that \"extreme MAGA Republicans have established a Select Committee on Insurrection Protection.\"\n\nMost Read Trump Administration Texted College Professors' Personal Phones to Ask If They're Jewish Akela Lacy After Tucker Carlson Guest Attacked a Defense Advisory Board, the Pentagon Nuked Its Website Matt Sledge Pentagon Insiders on Hegseth Leak Hypocrisy: \"Full On Shit Show\" Nick Turse\n\nRather than being a true heir to the Church Committee, Jordan's subcommittee seems destined to follow the pattern of the Army-McCarthy hearings of 1954. Jordan and today's Republicans are employing the same kind of resentment and grievances against \"elites\" that fueled Joseph McCarthy, and Jordan also seems destined to use some of McCarthy's tactics, targeting individual officials to claim they are \"woke\" or part of the \"deep state\" - updated versions of McCarthy's phraseology about \"Communist subversion.\" It's no coincidence that Roy Cohn, who worked as chief counsel to McCarthy during the Army-McCarthy hearings, later became a key mentor to Trump in the work of launching vicious political attacks.\n\nPreviously an obscure back-bench Republican senator from Wisconsin, McCarthy surged to fame in 1950, when he falsely claimed in a speech in Wheeling, West Virginia, to have a list of Communists in the State Department, triggering a period of intense paranoia and witch hunting that is now known as the McCarthy era. After he became a committee chair in 1953, McCarthy switched his focus to the Army, with Cohn by his side.\n\nBy going after the State Department and then the Army, McCarthy took on two of the most important and tradition-bound institutions in the United States at the time. The State Department had not fought back successfully against McCarthy, but the Army did. After McCarthy charged Army leaders with ignoring evidence of Communist subversion at a military facility in New Jersey, the Army went on the attack, accusing McCarthy of seeking special treatment for David Schine, a McCarthy consultant and friend of Cohn's. The charges and counter-charges ultimately led to a long-running series of nationally televised hearings that garnered huge audiences, pitting McCarthy and Cohn against Joseph Welch, an urbane outside lawyer brought in to represent the Army.\n\nIn a televised hearing on June 9, 1954, McCarthy and Welch engaged in a historic showdown, with Cohn looking on. Bitter at Welch, McCarthy publicly raised questions about the loyalty of Fred Fisher, a lawyer at Welch's law firm. Welch's devastating response - \"Have you no sense of decency?\" - has gone down in history as the moment McCarthy's power was broken.\n\nIn December 1954, the Senate finally voted to censure McCarthy; by 1957, he was dead.\n\nDoes the shame that finally brought down McCarthy still have the power to curb Republican excesses? Johnson, Church's former aide, isn't so sure.\n\n\"We're headed for something that combines a witch hunt with a circus,\" Johnson said, noting that the so-called new Church Committee \"is likely to make the 1950s McCarthy hearings appear, in retrospect, rather benign.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Reps. Adam Schiff and Jim Jordan Killed Mass Surveillance Reform in 2020. Will They Do It Again?\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nTop House Democrats have shown a willingness to work with the Freedom Caucus to block progressive reforms.\n\nIn 2020, Democrats were closer than they ever had been to reforming U.S. intelligence agencies' vast surveillance powers since the most damaging parts of the Foreign Surveillance Intelligence Act, or FISA, were signed into law almost two decades prior. By that point, Edward Snowden's 2013 revelations, showing that both the Bush and Obama administrations were sweeping up American phone records in bulk, had been festering in the public consciousness for years. The leaks - combined with right-wing outrage at how the FISA court had treated the Trump campaign - created an opening for civil liberties champions and their allies in Congress to start reining in rogue collection methods.\n\nBut on the cusp of their most promising effort to date, reformers were stymied by the unlikely alliance of then-Freedom Caucus Chair Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, and then-House Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff, D-Calif. Schiff, desperate to prevent reforms which would alienate him from both House leadership and the intelligence community, worked to water down progressive demands, as was reported at the time. In exchange for Freedom Caucus votes, Jordan received concessions to increase the attorney general's oversight of FISA and toothless language increasing penalties for deceiving the FISA court. Having successfully neutered progressives' hopes, and secured Jordan's vote to force the weakened bill through committee with an up-or-down vote, the bill was sent to the Senate, where a brief authorization extension was approved but ultimately killed when it came back to the House, dooming reform.\n\nNow, as the deadline for another FISA reauthorization looms at the end of this year, both lawmakers are in influential positions to again crush reform. Despite being stripped of his seat on the Intelligence Committee by the new GOP majority in the House, Schiff has endeared himself with Democratic Party leadership chairing Donald Trump's impeachment hearings . Jordan, christened with new powers wrung from House Speaker Kevin McCarthy during a bloody leadership election , now controls the House Judiciary Committee.\n\n\"One major battle coming up this year is warrantless wiretapping authorization,\" David Segal, co-founder of the progressive advocacy organization Demand Progress, told The Intercept. \"We expect the same factors from 2020 will be in play and will create a serious opportunity to reform these opaque government surveillance authorities.\"\n\n\"We expect this fight to pit ideologues in both parties against the national security establishment which has been responsible for myriad surveillance abuses from warrantless wiretapping to the metadata collection Snowden revealed and surely practices that we are not even aware of right now.\"\n\nIn 2018, Trump signed a reauthorization of one part of FISA - Section 702 - extending the provision authorizing bulk data collection of non-U.S. citizens residing outside of the country for six years. While proponents of FISA claimed this provision protects Americans' civil liberties by only targeting noncitizens residing outside of the United States, U.S. citizens' data is routinely swept up under 702 FISA collection. Because Section 702 allows for targeting based on the exceedingly broad category of \"Foreign Intelligence Information,\" the dragnet cast by U.S. surveillance agencies collects data from U.S. citizens communicating with so-called non-U.S. persons.\n\nTrump turned against FISA two years later, after a report compiled by Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz found the FBI had abused FISA to surveil Trump campaign adviser Carter Page, forcing FBI Director James Comey to admit that the FBI had made serious mistakes in their handling of the case.\n\n\"If the FISA Bill is passed tonight on the House floor, I will quickly VETO it, Our Country has just suffered through the greatest political crime in its history. The massive abuse of FISA was a big part of it!\" Trump tweeted.\n\nThe Carter Page incident created a new enemy in the FBI for Trump loyalists in the Freedom Caucus, and Jordan seized on FISA as another weapon of the \"deep state\" targeting Trump. The demands of the Freedom Caucus to rein in government surveillance overreach began to align with those of progressives who had long called for a tightening of FISA's reach in light of the Snowden revelations.\n\nOriginal reporting.

Reformers including Congressional Progressive Caucus leader Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., and Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., began to push for major changes including an end to widespread phone data collection and broadened oversight mechanisms for the court's internal workings. Then-House Judiciary Committee Chair Jerry Nadler sponsored the FISA reauthorization bill, and the committee scheduled a bill markup. Despite pressure from House leadership to stand down, Lofgren refused, forcing Nadler to take the extraordinary step of killing the markup of his own bill, in his own committee.\n\nThen-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Schiff began to formulate alternative plans to see FISA renewal through to the president's desk. At the same time that Schiff negotiated around the reforms proposed by Lofgren and other civil liberties advocates, he also began negotiating with Jordan . The deal struck with Jordan is buried in the amendments to the final bill, which would have given the U.S. attorney general - then Bill Barr - greater surveillance oversight of federal political candidates. Barr publicly pressed for the reauthorization.\n\nIn the end, everyone involved in the negotiations lost out in part. The intelligence community and its allies in Congress failed to secure a critical renewal of powerful surveillance tools at their disposal. Meanwhile, champions of civil liberties found themselves once again blocked at even partial reforms to FISA.\n\n\"In 2020 we exploited partisan crosscurrents and concern about mass surveillance on the left and right to ultimately watch the sunsetting of Patriot Act Reauthorization,\" Segal, of Demand Progress, said.\n\nWhere Jordan and Schiff will come down on reauthorizing Section 702 this year remains unclear. Jordan has vowed to reform FISA in the upcoming Congress, but he could easily try to strike another softball deal that fails to significantly curb surveillance powers while playing to his political base.\n\nJordan and the rest of the Freedom Caucus members who repeatedly withheld their vote for House speaker earlier this month have laid out a vision of challenging the surveillance agencies they have framed as antagonists to Trump and his political vision. As chair of the brand new Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government , Jordan has voiced his intent to investigate the FBI and DHS in the same way that the Church Committee was used to pursue intelligence agencies including the NSA and CIA during the mid-1970s.\n\nOne crack in FISA's broad mandate has already started to show. In a 2022 unclassified report from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the agency's civil liberties division notes that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court \"did not issue any Section 702 orders in 2021.\"\n\nIt's unclear whether the FISA court blocked Section 702 surveillance requests and why, as the justification for the extension is currently sealed. Civil liberties advocates are currently working to request through the Freedom of Information Act the rationale behind the blocked 702 authorization, which, if successfully revealed, could influence the course of congressional reform negotiations.\n\n\"The FISC's protracted review tells us something important is going on behind closed doors,\" Sarah Taitz, a legal fellow at the ACLU's National Security Project told The Intercept. \"It signals that the court has been grappling with novel or serious issues regarding this warrantless mass surveillance - and the public needs to know why. As Congress considers whether to reauthorize Section 702, Americans should not be in the dark about a spying program with immense consequences for our rights.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "House \"Weaponization\" Committee Arms Itself, Takes Aim at Biden, FBI\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nRep. Jim Jordan launched his Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government at a familiar set of right-wing talking points.\n\nAhead of the inaugural hearing of his new investigatory committee, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, darted back and forth across the hearing room floor to check in with his key witnesses before scanning every face in the room and then, assuming his throne, smashing the gavel down to order.\n\nAs the chair of the Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, Jordan holds new powers to investigate the FBI, Department of Homeland Security , and IRS, federal agencies he claims have all colluded to attack conservative causes and the former president in equal measure. Along with subpoena power, the committee will also serve as a new bully pulpit to lash out at the sitting president while driving investigations into his family.\n\nJordan claimed during the nascent committee's inception that it would follow in the footsteps of Sen. Frank Church, who, decades ago, used his perch on the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations With Respect to Intelligence Activities to investigate illegal spying on U.S. civilians by the National Security Agency and widespread CIA overreach culminating in domestic propaganda campaigns. Thursday's hearing suggested that any effort to fundamentally reform out-of-control law enforcement and surveillance agencies would come second to both parties' attempts to use the committee for political ends.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe bombastic representative has taken every opportunity to rail against the perceived injustices of the \"deep state\" and curry favor with former President Donald Trump. He has fended off repeated attacks over past scandals and continues to amass power in Congress even as his radicalism has at times alienated him from his Freedom Caucus colleagues in the farthest right reaches of the GOP.\n\nThe one exception to Jordan's approach came in a short exchange between Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and former FBI agent and committee witness Thomas Baker, in which Massie pressed Baker on the use of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows for the backdoor surveillance of American citizens by monitoring the communications of noncitizens abroad. Massie, a long-standing foe of the NSA and its mass surveillance programs revealed by Edward Snowden, suggested that the committee could play a role in determining the law's fate. FISA 702 is up for reauthorization this year and must be approved for continuation by Congress. \"I hope we look at this going forward,\" he told the committee. Jordan, meanwhile, renewed his time-honored tone.\n\n\"In my time in Congress, I have never seen anything like this, dozens and dozens of whistleblowers, FBI agents, coming to us talking about what is going on, the political nature of the Justice Department. It's not Jim Jordan saying this, not Republicans, not conservatives - good FBI agents who are willing to come forward and give us the truth.\"\n\nWhile Jordan focused his opening remarks on FBI whistleblowers reporting perceived targeting of conservatives, the committee chair left the pointed attacks on the Biden administration to the first two members of the assembled panel, Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Ron Johnson, R-Wis.\n\nDemocrats' control of the Senate has long stymied Republican efforts to investigate President Joe Biden and his son for business dealings abroad and the fallout over the laptop containing compromising images of Hunter Biden. But before Jordan's committee, the two senators found a new audience to revive their complaints, both hammering law enforcement agencies they say are compromised by liberal appointments and political maneuvering.\n\nGrassley described his ongoing efforts to investigate the Biden family as something out of a \"fiction spy thriller,\" with senior FBI leadership, first installed under the Obama administration, working to improperly release information about Hillary Clinton's email servers, conceal the connection of the Biden family to foreign powers, and restrict information to stymie his investigations with Johnson.\n\n\"This story of government abuse and political treachery is scarier than fiction,\" Grassley said. \"It really happened. Help us write the last chapter in this real-life drama. You must relentlessly produce the facts and the evidence. Sen. Johnson and I will do the same and are willing to work with you.\"\n\nJohnson followed suit, painting a picture of a global leftist cabal enacting its agenda within federal government agencies. \"It is important to recognize corrupt individuals within agencies that I am talking about are not acting alone,\" Johnson said. \"They operate as vital partners of the left-wing political movement that includes most members of the mainstream media, Big Tech, social media giants, global institutions and foundations, Democratic Party operatives, and elected officials. As the [Twitter] files reveal, these actors work in concert to defeat government control over our lives.\"\n\nTulsi Gabbard, the heterodox former Democratic representative from Hawaii, focused much of her testimony on online censorship and communications between senior Twitter executives and members of federal law enforcement. A piece in The Intercept based on the so-called Twitter files showed that, while Twitter worked with law enforcement officials to monitor and restrict accounts deemed to pose a national security threat, it failed to maintain similar oversight over misleading posts from allied nations regarding U.S.-aligned objectives. Nonetheless, Gabbard spoke largely in vague broad strokes about domestic censorship and the threat limiting free speech poses to Democratic institutions.\n\n\"We have to stop this insanity and protect the sacred freedoms and vanquish the fear and self-censorship that is now pervasive,\" Gabbard said. \"But as we sit here today, the danger is that if we choose to reject or challenge whatever those in power declare is the so-called truth, we are accused of being anti-authority. We are accused of being a danger to society, accused of spreading misinformation, and are then targeted, smeared, and called things like a Russian asset, white supremacist, bigoted, racist, sexist, extremist, traitor, and so on.\"\n\nBefore the hearing, Jordan had already issued his first subpoena as committee chair, summoning FBI Director Christopher Wray to testify on the FBI's alleged surveillance of parents protesting at school board meetings over Covid-19 measures at their children's schools. Both Johnson and Jordan have hammered the FBI over a whistleblower complaint that alleges the FBI used counterterrorism tools and designations to target school board protesters. The Department of Justice rebuffed Jordan's efforts to demand information into ongoing investigations.\n\nRelated Reps. Adam Schiff and Jim Jordan Killed Mass Surveillance Reform in 2020. Will They Do It Again?\n\nDespite the fiery language of the assembled panel, scant reference was made to the FBI's long history of overreach and law-breaking extending well past both the Biden and Obama administrations. Similarly absent was reference to the known instances of FBI targeting left-wing protest movements with informants and agitators who have largely avoided the seemingly obvious charges of entrapment leveled against them.\n\nAs The Intercept reported this week, an FBI informant embedded with racial justice protesters in Colorado worked to coerce a protester into committing felonies while on the payroll of the FBI. Democrats on the committee and those testifying on their behalf also largely focused on threats made against the FBI to counter the GOP. They repeatedly referenced the dirty bomb threat made against FBI headquarters last year, alongside other threats and attacks on FBI field offices across the country.\n\n\"Your subcommittee can absolutely become part of a proud history of serious bipartisan oversight stretching from the Teapot Dome investigation, to the Boeing investigation, into the Watergate hearings, to the tobacco hearings, to the select committee on the January 6 attack,\" Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., told the committee. \"Or you take oversight down a very dark alley filled with conspiracy theories and disinformation. A place where facts are the enemy and partisan destruction is the overriding goal. Millions of Americans already fear that representation is the right name for the special subcommittee, not because weaponization of the government is its target, but because weaponization of the government is its purpose. What's in a name? Well, everything.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "House Republicans Warn That Bill Combating Big Money in Politics \"Resembles Russian Government Policy\"\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nSeveral Republican committee members described H.R. 1 - an attempt to reform the way we finance elections and oversee the executive branch - as \"chilling.\"\n\nRepublicans on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform denounced a major new initiative by Democrats to clean up elections and expand voter participation as a power grab that will corrupt the political process and infringe on the rights of free speech and association.\n\nIn nearly apocalyptic terms on Wednesday, Republican committee members took turns laying out the dire consequences of H.R. 1 , decrying the consequences of a federal holiday on Election Day, matching public funds for congressional candidates, increasing transparency in campaign finance, and making it easier to register to vote. More stringent disclosure requirements for political spending would encourage partisan monitoring and even doxxing, Republicans argued, citing the Obama-era scandal where the Internal Revenue Service was accused by conservatives of targeting conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status.\n\nDuring the Wednesday hearing, several minority members described the bill - an attempt to implement sweeping reforms to the way we finance elections and oversee the executive branch - as \"chilling.\" Ranking Member Jim Jordan said the bill was designed to benefit the majority by \"tilting the playing field in their favor.\"\n\nJordan denounced the bill for requiring states to offer early voting, no-excuse absentee voting, same day voter registration, automatic voter registration, paid leave for federal workers to be poll workers, to allow released felons to vote, to make Election Day a federal holiday, and to have taxpayer contributions finance campaigns.\n\n\"So lets take a whack at a little summary here, professor,\" Jordan said during his questioning of Bradley Smith, chair of the Institute for Free Speech and former chair of the Federal Election Commission, who testified at the invitation of the minority.\n\n\"H.R. 1 requires taxpayers to pay for a holiday on Election Day for government workers. H.R. 1 requires taxpayers to pay for six days of paid leave for government workers who want to be poll workers. H.R. 1 requires taxpayers to pay for politicians' campaigns. And if those same taxpayers give to some organization, some (c)(4), they can be outed under H.R. 1 so that the left can - or anyone - could harass them or their family.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Smith said. \"Such a deal for the taxpayer, right?\"\n\nThe bill, sponsored by Maryland Rep. John Sarbanes, is the first serious attempt in decades to revamp the model for public financing of presidential campaigns and establish a national program to publicly finance congressional campaigns. It also expands rights and protections for voters; bans senior federal officials from getting private sector perks after they leave office; prohibits senior federal employees from working on issues in which they have financial interests; and strengthens the call for Trump to divest his business holdings and place them in an independent, blind trust. Trump is the only president who hasn't done so.\n\nGeorgia Rep. Jody Hice said in opening remarks that he was \"extremely alarmed\" by the bill and that while its provision for automatic voter registration \"may sound good on the surface,\" it would \"open the floodgates for fraudulent voting by illegal individuals in this country.\"\n\n\"It's virtually 600 pages. Almost every page has issues of great concern,\" he said. In just under three minutes, the congressperson referenced \"illegals\" or being in the country \"illegally\" nine times.\n\nThe bill also equips the Office of Government Ethics with subpoena power and the authority to impose disciplinary action on agencies and employees within the executive branch - \"needed teeth,\" as the office's former director Walter Shaub said in written testimony to the committee.\n\nBut Jordan and his Republican colleague Rep. Mark Meadows argued that taxpayers shouldn't have to finance elections, let alone contribute to the campaigns of candidates whom they oppose. Meadows pointed to the fact that his own campaign was largely funded by small individual donors, and that under the measure, he'd get $3.8 million for re-election.\n\nLouisiana Rep. Clay Higgins conceded that the bill might have some worthwhile measures, but said he wanted to see it broken down into smaller components that would suit individual state needs. He also said the bill \"resembles Russian government policy.\"\n\nBipartisan legislation to strengthen democratic institutions in ways similar to those outlined in H.R. 1 have already passed at the local and state levels, Karen Hobert Flynn testified. She's the president of Common Cause, a nonpartisan organization focused on reducing the role of big money in politics. In written testimony to the committee, Flynn cited \"more than 20 red, blue and purple states and localities [that have] passed pro-voter democracy reforms, with strong support from Republican, Independent, and Democratic voters.\"\n\nSmith said his primary concern with the bill was its infringement on first amendment protections of free speech - wherein political spending is a form of speech. He said the bill would expand the universe of what Congress could regulate as political spending or speech, including ads. And he argued that in public financing there \"tend to be avenues for corruption in many ways.\"\n\nBut in all the concerns raised about voter fraud and abridging freedom of speech by reining in the influence of large donors, the minority never addressed the specter of partisan gerrymandering that's historically benefited their party, Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley pointed out. The ACLU filed suit last year to challenge gerrymandering in Ohio, citing Jordan's 4th District as one of seven that were drawn with \"borders that defy explanation by any political boundary or geographical feature.\" H.R. 1 would put an independent commission in charge of redistricting duties, taking that responsibility away from state legislatures.\n\n\"That is really convenient, and rich, and hypocritical,\" Pressley said.\n\n\"H.R. 1 has been described as a wishlist by the Democrats,\" she continued. \"Well, you got us there. A wishlist for an inclusive, expanded democracy and electorate.\n\n\"Characterizations of H.R. 1 as a power grab - you got us again,\" Pressley said, referencing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's comments on the push to make Election Day a federal holiday.\n\n\"Guilty,\" she said. \"We wouldn't have to grab back the power for the people if through policy you weren't complicit in, or perpetuating, the disenfranchisement and marginalization of the people. And disproportionately, people of color. And disproportionately, black people.\"\n\nMeadows had a heated exchange with Shaub, the former head of the OGE, in which he suggested the latter's support for an investigative mandate for OGE was politically motivated against President Donald Trump. Meadows cited Shaub's testimony to an oversight subcommittee in December 2015 in which he said he thought the OGE didn't need an investigative mandate, expressing shock at Shaub's change of heart \"all of a sudden.\"\n\n\"No, it's not all of a sudden at all,\" Shaub said. \"It's after watching, for two years, somebody prove to me that the executive branch ethics program is much weaker and much more fragile than I ever thought it was. Frankly, I was naive.\"\n\n\"I never imagined,\" Shaub went on, \"a president would come in and refuse to eliminate his conflicts of interest, have appointees who are completely disinterested in government ethics, and have - with all respect - a Congress refuse to exercise oversight over them in that respect.\"\n\nWe're independent of corporate interests - and powered by members.

Meadows agreed.\n\nOhio Rep. Bob Gibbs said that during his time in the state Senate, he helped pass legislation to implement no-excuse absentee ballots and early voting within 30 days before the election. \"We don't have lines anymore, and we don't need a federal holiday so you can go vote. You got 30 days to go vote. If you can't vote in 30 days by mail or by absentee, that just raises a lot of interesting questions about your voting - your abilities.\"\n\nDuring her questioning, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez asked Flynn, \"If I want to run a campaign that is entirely funded by corporate political action committees, is there anything that legally prevents me from doing that?\"\n\n\"No,\" Flynn said.\n\nOcasio-Cortez later pulled out an op-ed Smith authored for the Washington Post titled, \"Those payments to women were unseemly. That doesn't mean they were illegal.\"\n\n\"Okay, great. So, green light for hush money,\" she said. \"I can do all sorts of terrible things. It's totally legal right now for me to pay people off.

      "text": "The GOP's Kevin McCarthy Debacle Is an Insurrection by Other Means\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nTwo years after January 6, Republicans are still locked in a battle for personal political power.\n\nRep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., talks on the phone ahead of the ninth round of voting for speaker, as the House of Representatives meets for the third day to elect a speaker and convene the 118th Congress in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 5, 2023. Photo: Andrew Harnik/AP Reps. Andy Biggs and Scott Perry, two Republican House members leading the effort to block Rep. Kevin McCarthy's bid to become speaker, were among four GOP members of Congress referred to the House Ethics Committee for their roles in Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election .\n\nRep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., talks on the phone ahead of the ninth round of voting for speaker, as the House of Representatives meets for the third day to elect a speaker and convene the 118th Congress in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 5, 2023.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, who Republican holdouts briefly tried to install as an alternative speaker this week, was also referred by the House January 6 Committee; so was McCarthy himself.\n\nThe intraparty battle for control of the House of Representatives is not a fight between pro-Trump and anti-Trump camps. There are no real anti-Trump moderates left in the Republican House caucus. This is not a matter of competing political ideologies.\n\nThe speaker's battle would make a perfect \"Seinfeld\" episode: It is a fight about nothing.\n\nAnd that's what makes it so dangerous.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nNeither the pro-McCarthy camp nor the anti-McCarthy insurgents have any real policy goals for how to make the government more effective. The goal of the insurgents is to stop the government from working at all. Yet that is true of McCarthy and his supporters as well.\n\nThe only thing they are really fighting over is personal political power. Nothing more. And that makes it very difficult for McCarthy to appease the Republicans who oppose him.\n\nIt is fitting that the battle for control of the House comes exactly two years after the January 6, 2021, insurrection. The speakership fight is a continuation of that struggle for personal power. This is an insurrection by other means.\n\nEven if the speakership is decided in the coming days, this battle shows just how paralyzed Congress will be over the next two years.\n\nThis is the paralysis that the Biden administration and the Democrats in Congress tried to prepare for in December, when the frenetic activity in the House gave off an apocalyptic vibe. Every move was hurried, with an eye on the clock and the knowledge that darkness was looming.\n\nDuring the lame-duck session, the House Ways and Means Committee released a report about Trump's long-hidden tax returns; the House January 6 Committee held its final hearing and voted to issue criminal referrals of Trump and others to the Justice Department; Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed a joint session of Congress; and heavily bundled legislation that included continued funding for U.S. aid to Ukraine and new legal protections for the election of American presidents worked its way across Capitol Hill and was signed into law by Biden.\n\nNone of those things could wait any longer. The insurgents were about to take over the House.\n\nIn November, Republicans suffered some of the worst midterm results for an opposition party in modern American history, thanks to their turn toward right-wing extremism. The Republican-dominated Supreme Court had overturned Roe v. Wade , and many Republican candidates in key races were election deniers hand-picked by Trump. The Republican Party lacked a coherent policy agenda other than \"owning the libs.\" Voters were turned off, and, despite high inflation and a worsening economy, Democrats won key races around the country, retaining control of the Senate while losing the House by the narrowest of margins.\n\nYet the great irony is that the very narrowness of the Republican margin of victory in the House is what is now giving outsized influence to the extremist forces that cost the GOP so dearly.\n\nRather than fight back, McCarthy gave in to extremism years ago, and became one of Trump's most prominent enablers. His craven willingness to appease the ex-president and the insurgents in the House means that no one fears him. He is the Neville Chamberlain of the House, and even if he ultimately becomes speaker, he will not really be calling the shots. The insurgents will be in charge, and no one else in the Republican caucus is likely to challenge them.\n\nWith de facto control over the House, they will focus on the right-wing political equivalent of performance art: a national abortion ban that will go nowhere, investigating Hunter Biden's laptop, and other \"anti-woke\" ways to own the libs. They will not focus on governing.\n\nSo if Trump's taxes, hidden throughout his presidency, were ever going to see the light of day, it had to be before the new Congress convened. It took years for the Ways and Means Committee to get the returns, and then only after a lengthy court battle, which ended in November when the Supreme Court refused to block the documents' release. Once the committee prevailed in court, it had to release Trump's taxes and related information before House Republicans had the chance to suppress them.\n\nThe committee voted to release Trump's taxes and also offered some bombshells , revealing that the Internal Revenue Service did not audit Trump during the first two years of his presidency - and didn't begin to do so until the day in 2019 when the House asked for his tax returns and questioned whether any audits of Trump had been conducted. The IRS had failed to audit the sitting president's taxes even though it was mandated to do so, and even though it audited the taxes of both presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden. The committee also found that Trump paid no federal income tax in 2020, while he was president.\n\nThe House January 6 Committee also had to wrap up its business during the lame-duck session or see its work shut down after Republicans took over. In fact, rather than continue to investigate the insurrection, House Republicans are vowing to investigate the January 6 committee itself.\n\nSo after issuing criminal referrals for Trump and others, the January 6 committee released a final report and handed over all its evidence to the Justice Department and the special counsel investigating Trump's efforts to overturn the election. Among the committee's final disclosures was that its star witness, former Trump aide Cassidy Hutchinson, said that her former lawyer advised her not to tell the committee the whole truth.\n\nThe threats posed by House Republicans on so many fronts help explain why many Senate Republicans joined Democrats in December to pass a $1.7 trillion omnibus spending package. That legislation included aid for Ukraine, which many right-wing House Republicans want to block or at least scale back , and changes to the electoral reform act, which governs how presidential elections are finalized and includes changes designed to make it harder for Trump or someone like him to overturn future elections.\n\nSenate Republicans voted for the legislation in the face of furious opposition from their pro-Trump counterparts in the House, perhaps a sign that at least some Senate Republicans no longer fear Trump and his minions.\n\nIn fact, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has become more openly anti-Trump since the midterms, when Trump-backed fringe candidates lost key contests and cost the GOP control of the Senate. While McCarthy was fighting for the speakership in the House this week, McConnell made a move heavy with symbolism: He appeared in Kentucky with Biden to showcase a major federal infrastructure investment in a bridge across the Ohio River.\n\nThe question now is whether Biden can count on a relatively sane Senate to check the worst impulses of the unstable House.\n\nWAIT!

One after another, they trashed Ukraine as a hopelessly corrupt swamp unworthy of American aid.\n\nDuring the hearings that led to the vote, Republicans in Congress even claimed that Trump's decision to withhold aid was in line with the Obama administration's prior efforts, led by then-vice president Biden, to stamp out corruption in Ukraine.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan and Trump himself repeated the Republican talking point that because Ukraine is \"one of the three most corrupt countries on the planet,\" it was entirely reasonable to test the willingness of the new Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to tackle corruption.\n\nAid was delayed by just 55 days.\n\nDuring that time, we verified that President Zelensky was the real deal. pic.twitter.com/TWJbvGj2iz\n\n- Rep.

For good measure, Trump and his supporters in Congress have also claimed that Ukrainian officials who were dismayed by his support for Russia's annexation of Crimea or outraged by secret payments to Manafort from their corrupt former president colluded with Democrats to sabotage his 2016 campaign.\n\nWe're independent of corporate interests - and powered by members.

Lutsenko told Giuliani and Rion that he was affronted when Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch, the career foreign service official who took over as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine in 2016, pressed him to close an investigation and mentioned three Ukrainians by name whom he should not prosecute.\n\nEnraged by the request, Lutsenko said that he took out a piece of paper and made a list with the three names: \"Kasko, Leshchenko, Shabunin.\" He then theatrically tore up what he called a Do Not Prosecute list. In another account, Lutsenko compared the request from the U.S. ambassador to the sorts of lists of protected people that used to be circulated in Soviet times.\n\nA screenshot from a One America News interview of former Ukrainian prosecutor Yuri Lutsenko by Rudy Giuliani and Chanel Rion.\n\nHowever, what Lutsenko failed to explain to Giuliani and OAN viewers is that those three men were all noted anti-corruption activists who were, at the time, the subject of politically motivated investigations or harassment by the chief prosecutor's office. Vitaliy Kasko is a former deputy prosecutor who resigned in 2016 and accused Shokin's office of being a \"hotbed of corruption.\" Sergii Leshchenko is a Ukrainian investigative journalist who was elected to parliament after the uprising, and displayed pages from the so-called black ledger detailing secret payments to Manafort at a news conference in Kyiv in 2016. Vitaliy Shabunin is a co-founder, along with Daria Kaleniuk, of the Anti-Corruption Action Centre, a nonprofit partly funded by the U.S. government. Shabunin has faced what Kaleniuk calls \"a series of well-planned attacks from various corrupt officials and oligarchs\" in retaliation for his efforts to expose corruption and demand transparency.\n\nRead our Complete Coverage\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported last month that the case Yovanovitch asked Lutsenko to drop was an investigation of Shabunin and Kaleniuk's nonprofit, known as AntAc. Kaleniuk, an American-educated lawyer, told The Intercept in May that state prosecutors investigated a grant from the U.S. to the nonprofit simply because they were jealous that the funds to combat corruption had been awarded to the activists instead of the chief prosecutor's office.\n\nIn early September, near the apex of the pressure campaign on Zelensky, Kasko was appointed first deputy to Ukraine's new chief prosecutor. Leshchenko, who was an adviser to Zelensky until Giuliani attacked him by name in a Fox News interview for supposedly convincing the new president not to meet with him, has returned to journalism full time and stands by his contention that the records of Manafort's financial crimes he publicized are genuine.\n\n\"We are desperately trying to change the country ... from a very corrupt kleptocracy to a democracy,\" Kaleniuk told the Los Angeles Times last month. \"This is Ukraine's moment, the moment to help. And instead, we got a knife in the back.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "House Republicans Release Text of Redacted Fauci Emails on Covid Origins\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nA scientist told The Intercept he was advised not to \"mention a lab origin as that will just add fuel to the conspiracists\" after a call with NIH leaders.\n\nOn Tuesday, Republicans on the House Committee on Oversight and Reform released a letter that paints a damning picture of U.S. government officials wrestling with whether the novel coronavirus may have leaked out of a lab they were funding, acknowledging that it may have, and then keeping the discussion from spilling out into public view.\n\nThe letter, signed by James Comer, R-Ky., and Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, was followed by pages of notes on emails that were first obtained through the Freedom of Information Act by BuzzFeed News and the Washington Post , but were heavily redacted when published in June 2021. The redacted emails included the agenda for a February 1, 2020, telephone conference between National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci; his then-boss, former National Institutes of Health director Francis Collins; and several of the world's leading virologists. The communications contained extensive notes summarizing what was said during the call, but their substance was hidden at the time.\n\nOversight Committee staff were able to view the full emails \"in camera,\" which means they could physically look at them and take notes but couldn't take copies with them. The information released Tuesday for the first time reveals the content of notes taken on the February 1 call.\n\nOn that call, virologists Michael Farzan and Robert Garry told Fauci and Collins the virus might have leaked from the Wuhan lab. It might have been genetically engineered, the transcription of Garry's notes suggests, but this now seems unlikely. Another possibility, put forward by Farzan, was that it could have been evolved in the lab through a process known as serial passage.\n\n\"The email is out-of-context,\" Garry wrote Wednesday in an email to The Intercept. \"This was one email among many I was sharing with my colleagues.\"\n\nWe're independent of corporate interests - and powered by members.

Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe two methods represent two different ideas behind the so-called lab-leak hypothesis. The one that gained notoriety early in the pandemic is genetic engineering, where scientists insert and delete nucleotides in the virus's genetic code, in this case viral RNA, to turn it into something new. This version forms the basis of accusations that the virus was intentionally created as a bioweapon - which practically every credible scientist has dismissed as an illogical conspiracy, but was quickly embraced by former President Donald Trump and much of the American right wing, souring scientists, liberals, and the mainstream on the possibility of lab origin. The less lurid but seemingly more plausible version is the idea of evolution through serial passage, in which scientists allow a virus to jump between host species or cell cultures, spurring new mutations.\n\nThe day before the call, Scripps Research infectious disease expert Kristian Andersen had warned Fauci that the virus may have been engineered in a lab, noting that he and several other high-profile scientists \"all find the genome inconsistent with expectations from evolutionary theory.\" The scientists agreed to have a conference call the next day. \"It was a very productive back-and-forth conversation where some on the call felt it could possibly be an engineered virus,\" Fauci told Alison Young, writing for USA Today , in June 2021.\n\nNot long after the call, Andersen was the lead author on a paper in Nature Medicine titled \"The Proximal Origin of SARS-CoV-2.\" The paper proposed \"two scenarios that can plausibly explain the origin of SARS-CoV-2: (i) natural selection in an animal host before zoonotic transfer; and (ii) natural selection in humans following zoonotic transfer.\" For the scientists and pundits who sought to discount the emerging lab-leak hypothesis, it offered the authoritative proof they needed. The paper has since been accessed more than 5.6 million times, with over 2,000 citations.\n\nThe authors acknowledged a third scenario, \"selection during passage,\" but they discussed it briefly and presented it as by far the least plausible. The newly released notes from the call, however, suggest that the scientists Fauci consulted initially considered that possibility to be much more serious than the paper let on.\n\nOn February 2, Jeremy Farrar, an infectious disease expert and the director of Wellcome, sent around notes, including to Fauci and Collins, summarizing what some of the scientists had said on the call. Farzan, a Scripps professor who studied the spike protein on the 2003 SARS virus, \"is bothered by the furin site and has a hard time explain that as an event outside the lab (though, there are possible ways in nature, but highly unlikely),\" Farrar's note reads, referring to a spike protein feature that aids interaction with furin, a common enzyme in human lung cells. Farzan didn't think the site was the product of \"directed engineering,\" but found that the changes would be \"highly compatible with the idea of continued passage of the virus in tissue culture.\"\n\nAccording to the transcribed notes, Garry, a professor at the Tulane University School of Medicine, said on the call that he had aligned the SARS-CoV-2 genome with that of RaTG13, a 96-percent similar virus isolated from bats at the Wuhan Institute of Virology that was long regarded as the new virus's closest known relative - though a closer one has since been identified . Garry found that the spike proteins of RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2, which makes the latter so infectious, were nearly identical. The key distinction was in the ability of the new virus's spike protein to interact with furin, which Garry found too perfect to make natural sense. \"I just can't figure out how this gets accomplished in nature,\" he said.\n\n\"My initial impression and that of others about the [furin cleavage site] was wrong. I changed my mind with new information/new data,\" Garry wrote to The Intercept. \"That's how science works. No one was trying to mislead the public. What was in the Proximal Origins paper was our best analysis - it's held up extremely well.\"\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage Origins of Covid\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nAs they discussed what to present to the public, the scientists determined that questions of potential lab origin might prove more trouble than they're worth. \"Given the evidence presented and the discussions around it, I would conclude that a follow-up discussion on the possible origin of 2019-nCoV would be of much interest,\" wrote Ron Fouchier, a virologist at the Erasmus MC Center for Viroscience in the Netherlands, on February 2. Years earlier, Fouchier's gain-of-function research had brought the discipline under fire for a 2011 experiment in which he infected ferrets in adjacent cages with the avian influenza virus, allowing it to become airborne and infect mammals. \"However, further debate about such accusations would unnecessarily distract top researchers from their active duties and do unnecessary harm to science in general and science in China in particular,\" Fouchier wrote.\n\nFarzan, Fauci, and Fouchier did not immediately respond to The Intercept's requests for comment.\n\nSeveral of the scientists on the email chain ended up co-authoring the Nature Medicine paper with Andersen and Garry. In a February 4 email, which House Republicans presented as a response to a first copy of the draft, Fauci wrote: \"?? Serial passage in ACE2-transgenic mice.\"\n\nThe early draft has not been made public, so we don't know what, exactly, sparked Fauci's reaction. But his words, which refer to the process of passaging a virus in \"humanized\" laboratory mice - or mice that have been genetically modified to express receptors for human ACE2, an enzyme that occurs in the lungs - do not appear in the published paper.\n\n\"Neither Drs. Fauci or Collins edited our Proximal Origins paper in any way. The major feedback we got from the Feb 1 teleconference was: 1. Don't try to write a paper at all - it's unnecessary or 2. If you do write it don't mention a lab origin as that will just add fuel to the conspiracists,\" Garry wrote on Wednesday.\n\nWhen the paper appeared in Nature Medicine on March 17, 2020, it noted near the end that in order for the novel coronavirus to have emerged in a lab via serial passage, scientists would have to conduct those experiments using a relative with very high genetic similarity, but there was no evidence that such experiments had been done. The authors added, \"Subsequent generation of a polybasic cleavage site,\" which lets the virus process furin, \"would have then required repeated passage in cell culture or animals with ACE2 receptors similar to those of humans, but such work has also not previously been described.\"\n\nThough the paper was publicly embraced by the scientific community and the mainstream media, Collins worried that its impact wasn't sufficient. \"Wondering if there is something NIH can do to help put down this very destructive conspiracy,\" Collins wrote on April 16, 2020, in reference to a Fox News segment on the lab-leak theory. \"I hoped the Nature Medicine article on the genomic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 would settle this. But probably didn't get much visibility. Anything more we can do?\"\n\n\"I would not do anything about this right now,\" Fauci replied. \"It is a shiny object that will go away in times.\"\n\nUpdate: January 13, 2021\n\nAfter publication, Robert Garry clarified his previous comments to The Intercept: \"One thing that could be misconstrued is that neither Dr Fauci or Dr Collins suggested in any way that we not write the Proximal Origin paper. Likewise, neither one suggested that we not mention the possibilty of a Lab origin. These were comments from others in emails after the call.\" The story's sub-headline has been updated to reflect Garry's clarification that the advice did not come from NIH officials but from others following the call.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

Jim Jordan, a right-wing ally of former President Donald Trump, and has a much different objective than the original Church Committee: The panel is widely expected to become a pro-Trump star chamber, investigating the officials and organizations that have previously investigated Trump, including the FBI and the Justice Department.\n\nWe're independent of corporate interests - and powered by members.

Kevin McCarthy during McCarthy's marathon bid to become House speaker last week, is now being rewarded with the mandate and resources to conduct investigations into almost any corner of the government he chooses; those probes have the potential to make the Biden administration look bad or Trump look good. McCarthy has even authorized the subcommittee to examine ongoing criminal investigations, which the Justice Department will certainly oppose.\n\nBy calling their panel the new Church Committee, Jordan and the Republicans are trying to assume the mantle of one of the most iconic investigative committees in congressional history. (I've spent the last several years researching and writing a book about Sen. Frank Church and his eponymous panel, which will be published in May.)\n\n\"When you reach back in history and bring a phrase from the past to the present, you get to carry a meaning into contemporary time,\" observed Stephanie Martin, the Frank and Bethine Church Endowed Chair of Public Affairs at Boise State University in Idaho, the native state of Sen. Church, the Democrat who chaired the original Church Committee. \"By calling it the Church Committee,\" she added, Republicans are appropriating the image \"of effective change and effective oversight.\"\n\nJordan and the Republicans are trying to assume the mantle of one of the most iconic investigative committees in congressional history.\n\nBut the differences between the Church Committee and Jordan's new subcommittee are stark, observes Loch Johnson, who served as an aide to Church on the committee and later wrote a firsthand account of the committee's work. \"The Church Committee was strongly oriented toward following the documentary evidence that we were able to uncover,\" said Johnson. \"The inquiry was driven not by ideology, revenge, or anything else but the facts.\" Today's Republicans, he added, seem \"motivated by ideology and a sense of grievance, starting with the 'stolen election' of 2020.\"\n\nJohnson and others argue that what the Republicans are creating is unlikely to be anything like the Church Committee, especially if, as seems almost certain, it descends into conspiracy theories about a mythical \"deep state\" that is out to get Trump and conservatives.\n\nThe existence of an anti-Trump \"deep state\" has become one of the most persistent conspiracy theories on the right and feeds into the anger and resentment against the government held by pro-Trump forces, including Jordan. Like all powerful and lasting conspiracy theories, it relies on some basic facts - but then turns reality on its head to reach a fantastical conclusion.\n\nIt is true that America is burdened with a sprawling and ever-growing military-industrial complex built on a network of relationships linking the Pentagon; the CIA; Homeland Security; defense, intelligence, and counterterrorism contractors; and many others in a powerful and partially hidden web that, over the past few decades, has pushed the nation into a period of nearly endless war. The traditional post-World War II military-industrial complex grew steadily for decades despite President Dwight Eisenhower's famous warning about its rising power in his 1961 farewell address : \"In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.\" Its power expanded exponentially after the September 11 attacks as counterterrorism and homeland security became big businesses, making it far more difficult for the United States to ever reduce its paranoia over the threat of terrorism.\n\nBut today's combined military, intelligence, and counterterrorism complex is a capitalistic, pro-military center of gravity in American society. It is not anti-Trump or anti-conservative, and it is definitely not a secret political organization bent on imposing \"woke\" views on Americans.\n\nIn fact, it was the work of the Church Committee that helped ensure that the \"deep state\" is nothing more than a right-wing conspiracy theory today. In the first three decades after World War II, the U.S. intelligence community faced no real oversight or outside scrutiny, and as a result, the CIA, the FBI, and the NSA grew beyond presidents' ability to control and became increasingly lawless. The reforms created as a result of the Church Committee helped to bring the intelligence community fully under the rule of law for the first time. By disclosing a series of shocking abuses of power, Church and his committee created rules of the road for the intelligence community that largely remain in place today.\n\nThe Church Committee's work represented a watershed moment in American history - which is why Republicans are now so eager to co-opt its name. But there is no evidence that Jordan plans to follow the earlier panel's serious and comprehensive approach. In fact, the involvement of Jordan and other House Republicans in Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election already constitutes an obvious conflict of interest. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the New York Democrat who is now House minority leader, tweeted that \"extreme MAGA Republicans have established a Select Committee on Insurrection Protection.\"\n\nMost Read Trump Administration Texted College Professors' Personal Phones to Ask If They're Jewish Akela Lacy After Tucker Carlson Guest Attacked a Defense Advisory Board, the Pentagon Nuked Its Website Matt Sledge Pentagon Insiders on Hegseth Leak Hypocrisy: \"Full On Shit Show\" Nick Turse\n\nRather than being a true heir to the Church Committee, Jordan's subcommittee seems destined to follow the pattern of the Army-McCarthy hearings of 1954. Jordan and today's Republicans are employing the same kind of resentment and grievances against \"elites\" that fueled Joseph McCarthy, and Jordan also seems destined to use some of McCarthy's tactics, targeting individual officials to claim they are \"woke\" or part of the \"deep state\" - updated versions of McCarthy's phraseology about \"Communist subversion.\" It's no coincidence that Roy Cohn, who worked as chief counsel to McCarthy during the Army-McCarthy hearings, later became a key mentor to Trump in the work of launching vicious political attacks.\n\nPreviously an obscure back-bench Republican senator from Wisconsin, McCarthy surged to fame in 1950, when he falsely claimed in a speech in Wheeling, West Virginia, to have a list of Communists in the State Department, triggering a period of intense paranoia and witch hunting that is now known as the McCarthy era. After he became a committee chair in 1953, McCarthy switched his focus to the Army, with Cohn by his side.\n\nBy going after the State Department and then the Army, McCarthy took on two of the most important and tradition-bound institutions in the United States at the time. The State Department had not fought back successfully against McCarthy, but the Army did. After McCarthy charged Army leaders with ignoring evidence of Communist subversion at a military facility in New Jersey, the Army went on the attack, accusing McCarthy of seeking special treatment for David Schine, a McCarthy consultant and friend of Cohn's. The charges and counter-charges ultimately led to a long-running series of nationally televised hearings that garnered huge audiences, pitting McCarthy and Cohn against Joseph Welch, an urbane outside lawyer brought in to represent the Army.\n\nIn a televised hearing on June 9, 1954, McCarthy and Welch engaged in a historic showdown, with Cohn looking on. Bitter at Welch, McCarthy publicly raised questions about the loyalty of Fred Fisher, a lawyer at Welch's law firm. Welch's devastating response - \"Have you no sense of decency?\" - has gone down in history as the moment McCarthy's power was broken.\n\nIn December 1954, the Senate finally voted to censure McCarthy; by 1957, he was dead.\n\nDoes the shame that finally brought down McCarthy still have the power to curb Republican excesses? Johnson, Church's former aide, isn't so sure.\n\n\"We're headed for something that combines a witch hunt with a circus,\" Johnson said, noting that the so-called new Church Committee \"is likely to make the 1950s McCarthy hearings appear, in retrospect, rather benign.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "House \"Weaponization\" Committee Arms Itself, Takes Aim at Biden, FBI\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nRep. Jim Jordan launched his Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government at a familiar set of right-wing talking points.\n\nAhead of the inaugural hearing of his new investigatory committee, Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, darted back and forth across the hearing room floor to check in with his key witnesses before scanning every face in the room and then, assuming his throne, smashing the gavel down to order.\n\nAs the chair of the Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, Jordan holds new powers to investigate the FBI, Department of Homeland Security , and IRS, federal agencies he claims have all colluded to attack conservative causes and the former president in equal measure. Along with subpoena power, the committee will also serve as a new bully pulpit to lash out at the sitting president while driving investigations into his family.\n\nJordan claimed during the nascent committee's inception that it would follow in the footsteps of Sen. Frank Church, who, decades ago, used his perch on the Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations With Respect to Intelligence Activities to investigate illegal spying on U.S. civilians by the National Security Agency and widespread CIA overreach culminating in domestic propaganda campaigns. Thursday's hearing suggested that any effort to fundamentally reform out-of-control law enforcement and surveillance agencies would come second to both parties' attempts to use the committee for political ends.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe bombastic representative has taken every opportunity to rail against the perceived injustices of the \"deep state\" and curry favor with former President Donald Trump. He has fended off repeated attacks over past scandals and continues to amass power in Congress even as his radicalism has at times alienated him from his Freedom Caucus colleagues in the farthest right reaches of the GOP.\n\nThe one exception to Jordan's approach came in a short exchange between Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., and former FBI agent and committee witness Thomas Baker, in which Massie pressed Baker on the use of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which allows for the backdoor surveillance of American citizens by monitoring the communications of noncitizens abroad. Massie, a long-standing foe of the NSA and its mass surveillance programs revealed by Edward Snowden, suggested that the committee could play a role in determining the law's fate. FISA 702 is up for reauthorization this year and must be approved for continuation by Congress. \"I hope we look at this going forward,\" he told the committee. Jordan, meanwhile, renewed his time-honored tone.\n\n\"In my time in Congress, I have never seen anything like this, dozens and dozens of whistleblowers, FBI agents, coming to us talking about what is going on, the political nature of the Justice Department. It's not Jim Jordan saying this, not Republicans, not conservatives - good FBI agents who are willing to come forward and give us the truth.\"\n\nWhile Jordan focused his opening remarks on FBI whistleblowers reporting perceived targeting of conservatives, the committee chair left the pointed attacks on the Biden administration to the first two members of the assembled panel, Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Ron Johnson, R-Wis.\n\nDemocrats' control of the Senate has long stymied Republican efforts to investigate President Joe Biden and his son for business dealings abroad and the fallout over the laptop containing compromising images of Hunter Biden. But before Jordan's committee, the two senators found a new audience to revive their complaints, both hammering law enforcement agencies they say are compromised by liberal appointments and political maneuvering.\n\nGrassley described his ongoing efforts to investigate the Biden family as something out of a \"fiction spy thriller,\" with senior FBI leadership, first installed under the Obama administration, working to improperly release information about Hillary Clinton's email servers, conceal the connection of the Biden family to foreign powers, and restrict information to stymie his investigations with Johnson.\n\n\"This story of government abuse and political treachery is scarier than fiction,\" Grassley said. \"It really happened. Help us write the last chapter in this real-life drama. You must relentlessly produce the facts and the evidence. Sen. Johnson and I will do the same and are willing to work with you.\"\n\nJohnson followed suit, painting a picture of a global leftist cabal enacting its agenda within federal government agencies. \"It is important to recognize corrupt individuals within agencies that I am talking about are not acting alone,\" Johnson said. \"They operate as vital partners of the left-wing political movement that includes most members of the mainstream media, Big Tech, social media giants, global institutions and foundations, Democratic Party operatives, and elected officials. As the [Twitter] files reveal, these actors work in concert to defeat government control over our lives.\"\n\nTulsi Gabbard, the heterodox former Democratic representative from Hawaii, focused much of her testimony on online censorship and communications between senior Twitter executives and members of federal law enforcement. A piece in The Intercept based on the so-called Twitter files showed that, while Twitter worked with law enforcement officials to monitor and restrict accounts deemed to pose a national security threat, it failed to maintain similar oversight over misleading posts from allied nations regarding U.S.-aligned objectives. Nonetheless, Gabbard spoke largely in vague broad strokes about domestic censorship and the threat limiting free speech poses to Democratic institutions.\n\n\"We have to stop this insanity and protect the sacred freedoms and vanquish the fear and self-censorship that is now pervasive,\" Gabbard said. \"But as we sit here today, the danger is that if we choose to reject or challenge whatever those in power declare is the so-called truth, we are accused of being anti-authority. We are accused of being a danger to society, accused of spreading misinformation, and are then targeted, smeared, and called things like a Russian asset, white supremacist, bigoted, racist, sexist, extremist, traitor, and so on.\"\n\nBefore the hearing, Jordan had already issued his first subpoena as committee chair, summoning FBI Director Christopher Wray to testify on the FBI's alleged surveillance of parents protesting at school board meetings over Covid-19 measures at their children's schools. Both Johnson and Jordan have hammered the FBI over a whistleblower complaint that alleges the FBI used counterterrorism tools and designations to target school board protesters. The Department of Justice rebuffed Jordan's efforts to demand information into ongoing investigations.\n\nRelated Reps. Adam Schiff and Jim Jordan Killed Mass Surveillance Reform in 2020. Will They Do It Again?\n\nDespite the fiery language of the assembled panel, scant reference was made to the FBI's long history of overreach and law-breaking extending well past both the Biden and Obama administrations. Similarly absent was reference to the known instances of FBI targeting left-wing protest movements with informants and agitators who have largely avoided the seemingly obvious charges of entrapment leveled against them.\n\nAs The Intercept reported this week, an FBI informant embedded with racial justice protesters in Colorado worked to coerce a protester into committing felonies while on the payroll of the FBI. Democrats on the committee and those testifying on their behalf also largely focused on threats made against the FBI to counter the GOP. They repeatedly referenced the dirty bomb threat made against FBI headquarters last year, alongside other threats and attacks on FBI field offices across the country.\n\n\"Your subcommittee can absolutely become part of a proud history of serious bipartisan oversight stretching from the Teapot Dome investigation, to the Boeing investigation, into the Watergate hearings, to the tobacco hearings, to the select committee on the January 6 attack,\" Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., told the committee. \"Or you take oversight down a very dark alley filled with conspiracy theories and disinformation. A place where facts are the enemy and partisan destruction is the overriding goal. Millions of Americans already fear that representation is the right name for the special subcommittee, not because weaponization of the government is its target, but because weaponization of the government is its purpose. What's in a name? Well, everything.\"\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

(Valerie Plesch / Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nDemocratic senator Jeanne Shaheen's aides quietly drafted legislation that would gut federal antitrust enforcers' budget - a move that could benefit some of the lawmaker's major finance, weapons, and health care industry donors whose industries are facing the prospect of tougher scrutiny from those antitrust regulators.\n\nSome of those donors' companies have been actively lobbying Congress on antitrust issues in the lead-up to Shaheen's proposed cut, according to federal disclosures reviewed by the Lever .\n\nShaheen aides slipped the budget-cutting provision into a must-pass 1,050-page bill to keep the government open. The language would strip the Justice Department's Antitrust Division of nearly $50 million, or roughly 18 percent of its resources.\n\nThe proposed cut comes out of a Shaheen-chaired Senate appropriations subcommittee, which issued a summary of the bill that failed to mention the controversial provision.\n\n\"There's going to be a bunch of companies that would have been sued for monopolization that will no longer be sued for monopolization,\" said Matt Stoller, director of research for the American Economic Liberties Project. \"And there's going to be a bunch of mergers that are going to go through that shouldn't go through because there aren't the resources.\"\n\nShaheen drafted a similar measure this past July, just days before the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission issued new proposals that could make it more difficult for corporations to merge. That enforcement initiative was met with immediate pushback from industries that have funneled big money to both parties.\n\nSenate majority leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) will be responsible for shepherding Shaheen's cut through the Senate. He is Congress's top recipient of campaign cash from the commercial banking industry, which significantly increased its lobbying amid a prospective antitrust crackdown from the Justice Department.\n\nIn 2022, Schumer killed legislation that would have applied greater antitrust scrutiny to the tech industry, which has delivered more than $780,000 to the New York lawmaker over his career.\n\nThe move to slash the Antitrust Division's budget comes as the Biden administration has responded to overwhelming public support to crack down on monopolies by ramping up enforcement efforts, with the support of many congressional Democrats and some Republicans .\n\nDuring President Joe Biden's term, federal regulators have sued to stop Amazon , Google , and Meta from expanding their tech monopolies, and are challenging the controversial Kroger-Albertsons supermarket merger.\n\nShaheen's staff inserted the language just days before Biden announced a new \"strike force\" of officials from the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division \"to crack down on unfair and illegal pricing.\"\n\n\"This strike force will strengthen interagency efforts to root out and stop illegal corporate behavior that hikes prices on American families through anti-competitive, unfair, deceptive, or fraudulent business practices,\" the White House announced on March 5.\n\nThe spending deal to slash regulators' enforcement budget would overturn a thirty-five-year-old rule that outlines the way the Antitrust Division gets money. In 1989, Congress passed legislation allowing the Antitrust Division to keep some of the fees corporations pay when mergers take place. In 2022, Congress passed legislation that increased the fees for large mergers and brought the Antitrust Division's budget to around $278 million for 2024, according to a Congressional Budget Office estimate.\n\nShaheen's proposal would vacate the 2022 law, eliminate the Antitrust Division's ability to collect merger fees, and slash the division's budget to $233 million to enforce antitrust laws throughout the entire American economy. For comparison, the legal budget of a single tech giant, Apple, has reportedly been as much as $1 billion.\n\nShaheen's legislation would also subject the Antitrust Division to heavily politicized funding cycles that plague other government agencies, potentially leading to less enforcement actions, said Stoller, who was first to report on the effort to cut the Antitrust Division's budget.\n\nThe funding cut is now facing stiff opposition from a bipartisan group of lawmakers who called for the funds to be restored.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the 2024 appropriations bill does not provide the Antitrust Division with full access to the pre-merger filing fees . . . . This limitation will hamper the ability of the Antitrust Division to utilize those additional funds to enhance its enforcement activities,\" wrote Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Chuck Grassley (R-IA), as well as Reps. Ken Buck (R-CO), Joe Neguse (D-CO), and Jerry Nadler (D-NY).\n\nShaheen's office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSome of Shaheen's top career contributors to her campaigns and political action committee are donors from companies with an interest in stopping antitrust efforts, according to data from the Federal Election Commission.\n\nFor instance, employees from the Capital Group, an investment management firm that manages more than $2 trillion dollars globally, are collectively Shaheen's ninth -largest career donor, providing more than $82,000 to her campaign committees, according to data compiled by OpenSecrets.\n\nThe Capital Group spent $1.6 million lobbying Congress and federal agencies on antitrust and other issues in 2022 as regulators issued new rules cracking down on mergers, according to disclosure records reviewed by the Lever .\n\nIn a letter authored by one of Shaheen's donors, the Capital Group urged regulators to back off a proposed rule to help the Justice Department better evaluate the effects of mergers on consumers. Additionally, company executives reportedly held a conference call with congressional staffers to criticize the proposal.\n\nLaw firms that make their money from facilitating corporate mergers also donated heavily to Shaheen.\n\nEmployees from Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, a multinational law firm specializing in corporate-finance issues including mergers and acquisitions , has delivered more than $27,000 to Shaheen's campaign committees. That included more than $11,000 from Ed Pagano, a former Obama administration official and current lobbyist for the law firm. Pagano and other employees of the firm lobbied federal officials on behalf of AT&T and DoorDash in 2022 regarding antitrust and other issues, disclosures show .\n\nEmployees from Ropes & Gray - a law firm specializing in antitrust litigation that says it was \"built around veterans of the US Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission\" and includes former antitrust prosecutors - gave $33,850 to Shaheen's election efforts from 2014 to 2020. Robert Jones, a lawyer for Ropes & Gray and former legal counsel to Mitt Romney when he served as Massachusetts governor, gave $5,600 to Shaheen in 2019, according to Federal Election Commission data.\n\nJoshua Levy, a former Ropes & Gray attorney who now works for the US Attorney's Office for the District of Massachusetts, donated $1,000 to Shaheen's campaign efforts in 2019 and 2020, federal data shows.\n\nDefense contractors facing antitrust actions - and new Justice Department scrutiny - have also donated heavily to Shaheen.\n\nEmployees from weapons manufacturer Raytheon, including company CEO Thomas Kennedy, have donated nearly $30,000 to Shaheen's election efforts. In January 2023, a US district judge declined to dismiss an antitrust lawsuit brought by employees at a Raytheon subsidiary who alleged the weapons manufacturer conspired to crush wages and limit employment opportunities.\n\nIt's a similar story for UK-based arms manufacturer BAE Systems - whose donors are collectively among Shaheen's top contributors for the current election cycle, according to OpenSecrets. When BAE Systems recently purchased Ball Aerospace for $5.5 billion , Justice Department antitrust regulators scrutinized the deal.\n\nShaheen received campaign donations from the president and CEO of BAE Systems and received donations from BAE Systems' chief operating officer, multiple vice presidents, and a slew of executives, federal data shows .\n\nBAE Systems spent $3.5 million in 2022 lobbying on a number of matters including the United States Innovation and Competition Act of 2021, which included provisions related to antitrust funding and enforcement, among other provisions.\n\nShaheen has also received $459,000 from donors at private equity and investment firms, $152,000 from donors in the tech industry , and nearly $300,000 from donors in the health care industry - all sectors facing new pressure from antitrust regulators.\n\nAmong those donors is UnitedHealth Group, whose political action committee has given $34,500 to Shaheen's campaign and affiliated political action committee. UnitedHealth owns the largest insurer in the country and is reportedly facing an antitrust investigation over its industry acquisitions.\n\nUnitedHealth's political action committee gave an additional $26,500 to Schumer, who is integral in ensuring Shaheen's antitrust funding cut makes it through the Senate.\n\nAn explanatory statement included with the spending bill proposal depicted the Antitrust Division's budget cut not as a favor for donors, but instead as a response to a political turf battle. The statement noted that before the Justice Department or Congress considers funding issues, they should work with the Senate Appropriations Committee, of which Shaheen is a member.\n\n\"The agreement recognizes the importance of predictable, sustainable funding for the Antitrust Division, and encourages the Department to work with Congressional committees of jurisdiction to address such challenges,\" staffers wrote in the explanatory statement.\n\nNormally, funding for government agencies comes out of the Appropriations Committee, but the 2022 funding increase for the Antitrust Division came out of the Competition Policy, Antitrust, and Consumer Rights subcommittee, which is under the Senate Judiciary Committee .\n\nStoller, with the American Economic Liberties Project, called the explanatory statement an \"annoying, nerdy way\" for the Appropriations Committee staffers to say they were upset.\n\n\"What [the Appropriations Committee staff] are saying is that they're mad that the Antitrust subcommittee increased fees for the division without going through Appropriations,\" Stoller said.\n\nStoller added that House Republicans have been extremely aggressive in trying to cut the Antitrust Division's budget and that the budget-cutting language could have been added as a compromise. Stoller said Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) has been trying to gut antitrust efforts for some time.\n\n\"This wasn't all just Shaheen,\" Stoller said. \"Shaheen probably didn't care or wasn't actively hostile to the Antitrust Division, and then Jordan just wants to get [antitrust] defunded. So [staffers] had to negotiate with the House.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Klobuchar, chair of the Senate Subcommittee on Competition Policy, Antitrust, and Consumer Rights, heavily criticized the decision to gut the Antitrust Budget, saying the move would \"reverse decades of precedent\" and would restructure how the Antitrust Division receives its funding.\n\n\"One pen, and [Appropriation Committee staffers] changed it,\" Klobuchar said during a Senate floor speech on March 5. \"We weren't able to see it ahead of time. Unbeknownst to us, they took the money and ran. They took the money and put it in other parts of the government's budget.\"\n\nYou can subscribe to David Sirota's investigative journalism project, the Lever , here .\n\nFreddy Brewster is a freelance reporter and has been published in the Los Angeles Times , NBC News, CalMatters, the Lost Coast Outpost , and other outlets across California.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

      "text": "Jim Jordan Tried to Help Trump Mount a Coup. Now He Gets to Be Speaker?\n\nJim Jordan, between lies, at a September 20, 2023 Judiciary Committee hearing. Tom Williams/Zuma\n\nRep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), like Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), the man he hopes to replace as House speaker, lies a lot. Jordan's rapid-style monologues-on topics such as Russia's attack on the  2016 election, Donald Trump's 2019 effort to extort Ukraine, Hunter Biden, and internet censorship-are often loaded with allegations that are demonstrably false . He has made pushing pro-Trump disinformation a priority for the GOP caucus. As the House Judiciary Committee chairman, he presides over a subcommittee on the supposed \"weaponization\" of the federal government that is mostly devoted to furthering Trump's claim that the former president is a victim of the Deep State and facing four indictments only because of a vast conspiracy. Jordan uses that post to promote the belief system of the Fox News bubble. And though he may stand out from his colleagues on brazenness, on most topics, his fibs align with his fellow House Republicans.\n\nBut Jordan, a leading contender for the speakership, does differ from his GOP colleagues in an important way: his unique role in helping Trump try to steal the 2020 election and launch the January 6 riot.\n\n. @Jim_Jordan claims he never said the election was stolen. That's not what the video shows. Let's roll the tape, shall we? pic.twitter.com/wOLI9l3TQW\n\n- Mother Jones (@MotherJones) January 12, 2021\n\nMany Republicans endorsed Trump's Big Lie about the election. But Jordan was one of only a handful of congressional Republicans who actively conspired with Trump to overturn the election results. As he runs for House speaker, Republicans appear eager to ignore that. Yet by embracing Jordan they tie themselves further to that attack on democracy and the Constitution.\n\nJordan was an early and enthusiastic recruit in Trump's war on the republic and reality-in public and in private.\n\nDays after the November election, he spoke at a \"Stop the Steal\" rally in front of the Pennsylvania state capitol. He spread election conspiracy theories within right-wing media. He endorsed Rudy Giuliani and Sidney Powell's bogus claims that Dominion Voting Systems and Smartmatic had robbed Trump of electoral victory. He called for a congressional investigation of electoral fraud for which there was no evidence and demanded a special counsel be appointed. He endorsed state legislatures canceling vote tallies and selecting their own presidential electors. He urged Trump not to concede. He demanded Congress not certify Joe Biden's victory in the ceremony scheduled for January 6, 2021.\n\nBehind the scenes, he schemed with Trump. The final report of the House select committee on January 6 lays out in damning detail Jordan's participation in Trump's eletion-thwarting machinations. \"Representative Jordan was a significant player in President Trump's efforts,\" the committee said. \"He participated in numerous post-election meetings in which senior White House officials, Rudolph Giuliani, and others, discussed strategies for challenging the election, chief among them claims that the election had been tainted by fraud.\"\n\nAs early as November, Jordan was \"involved in discussions with White House officials about Vice President Pence's role on January 6th,\" the report noted-conversations that focused on whether Pence could block the certification of Biden's win. Jordan was one of 10 Republican members of Congress who attended a White House meeting on December 21 where the topic was how to pressure Pence to undo the election.\n\nWhat understanding, if any, did Trump have with Jordan? The January 6 committee did not find out. And Jordan has never fully explained his role in Trump's scheming, let alone apologized. He refused to cooperate with the House January 6 committee's investigation. And now he is close to becoming House speaker-second-in-line to the presidency-without accounting for his participation in Trump's attempt to overturn an election.\n\nBut the committee did uncover evidence that Jordan was hatching some plan with Trump to mount a coup.\n\nOn December 27, 2020,  the defeated president held a phone call with Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and Acting Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue. Trump insisted that there had been widespread fraud in the election and raised numerous allegations that had been debunked. Rosen and Donoghue repeatedly told Trump there was no evidence of significant wrongdoing. Trump pushed the pair to publicly state that this had been an \"illegal\" election. He cited three Republican politicians who were supporting his claim of a stolen election: Representative Scott Perry (R-Penn.), Doug Mastriano, a Pennsylvania state senator, and Jordan, whom he praised as a \"fighter.\"\n\nWhen Rosen said to Trump that the Justice Department couldn't \"snap its fingers and change the outcome of the election,\" Trump responded, \"I don't expect you to do that. Just say the election was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican Congressmen.\" Trump did not explain what he meant or what the GOP House members-presumably including Jordan-intended to do if the Justice Department falsely declared the election fraudulent. Rosen and Donoghue refused to issue such a statement.\n\nOn January 2, 2021, Jordan led a conference call in which he, Trump, and other members of Congress discussed strategies for delaying the January 6 joint session of Congress, where the election results would be certified. \"During that call,\" according to the January 6 committee, \"the group also discussed issuing social media posts encouraging President Trump's supporters to 'march to the Capitol' on the 6th. An hour and a half later, President Trump and Representative Jordan spoke by phone for 18 minutes.\" It is not publicly known what the two discussed.\n\nThree days later, Jordan texted White House chief of staff Mark Meadows to pass along advice that Pence should \"call out all the electoral votes that he believes are unconstitutional as no electoral votes at all.\"\n\nOn January 6-a day of violent chaos and insurrection-Jordan spoke with Trump by phone at least twice. As the committee noted, Jordan \"has provided inconsistent public statements about how many times they spoke and what they discussed.\" That day Jordan also received five calls from Rudolph Giuliani, and the two connected at least twice in the evening, as Giuliani was attempting to encourage members of Congress to continue objecting to Biden's electoral votes. In the days after January 6, Jordan spoke with Trump White House staff about the prospect of presidential pardons for members of Congress.\n\nIt is obvious that Jordan knows a lot about Trump's attempt to sabotage the constitutional order and the run-up to the January 6 riot. But he has refused to share any of this with the public. On May 12, 2022, the January 6 committee subpoenaed several Republican members of Congress-including Jordan, McCarthy, Rep. Scott Perry (R-Penn.), and Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.)-to obtain information related to its investigation. Jordan and the others refused to cooperate.\n\nThe committee referred Jordan, McCarthy, Perry, and Biggs to the House Ethics Committee for sanction for failing to comply with subpoenas. The committee noted that Jordan and the others \"should be questioned in a public forum about their advance knowledge of and role in President Trump's plan to prevent the peaceful transition of power.\" It also stated that the Justice Department ought to seek testimony from Jordan regarding his \"materially relevant communications with Donald Trump or others in the White House.\"\n\nJordan was a key advocate of Trump's election falsehood and co-conspirator in Trump's bid to steal power. (Trump faces 17 felony counts for this effort.) He was one of the GOP's chief crusaders pushing falsehoods that threatened the constitutional order. If his fellow Republicans elevate Jordan to speaker, they will be fully embracing Trump's attack on the republic, and a profound threat to democracy will now be coming from inside the House.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Win or Lose, Jim Jordan Reveals What Republicans (Don't) Care About\n\nMother Jones; Francis Chung/POLITICO/AP\n\nRep. Jim Jordan's bid to become speaker hasn't worked, at least not yet. But Jordan has already succeeded in revealing that House Republicans mostly don't care about his leading role in Donald Trump's effort to subvert the 2020 election-or the prospect that Jordan, as speaker, might have more success stealing the next election.\n\nWith the exception of Rep. Ken Buck (R-Colo.), House Republicans have barely mentioned Jordan's involvement in Trump's plot, let alone sought assurances that he'd act differently as speaker. ( Allegations -which Jordan denies-that he failed to report sexual abuse of Ohio State wrestlers while he was an assistant coach for the team apparently aren't much of a concern for GOP lawmakers, either.)\n\nInstead, Republicans have focused on getting other promises from Jordan. That's pretty much what economists call a revealed preference -the thing that consumers really buy, regardless of what they say they want. The Party of Lincoln might talk about the Constitution and democracy, but in practice, its representatives have other priorities.\n\nFor example, farm subsidies. Some Republicans who initially balked at backing Jordan agreed to vote for him after he reportedly suggested he would allow passage of the annual farm bill, despite his long record of opposing such legislation. Similarly, Jordan seems to have won some support by indicating to GOP lawmakers that he would not to block legislation providing aid for Ukraine and Israel, meaning the he would allow a bill to pass with bipartisan support, despite his past opposition to supplemental aid for Ukraine.\n\nBut what the Republican converts did not get from Jordan-or, as far we know, even seek-is any explanation regarding his efforts to help Trump retain power after voters elected Joe Biden.\n\nThe House's January 6 committee called Jordan \"a significant player in President Trump's efforts\" leading up to the attack on the Capitol and GOP schemes to reject the election results. Jordan led a January 2, 2021, conference call in which he, Trump, and others \"discussed strategies for delaying the January 6 joint session of Congress,\" the panel said. That call included talk of encouraging Trump backers to \"march to the Capitol.\" Jordan also urged Vice President Mike Pence to reject electoral votes on January 6, something Pence lacked power to do. Jordan spoke twice to Trump on January 6, and he received five calls from Rudy Giuliani, as Trump and Giuliani pushed lawmakers to use the disruption caused by the attack on Congress to further delay certification of Biden's victory.\n\nJordan blew off a subpoena from the January 6 committee. And he has publicly offered only shifting, vague , and evasive statements about his contacts with Trump that day.\n\nWe have long known Jordan helped Trump plot ahead of January 6. And it's not all that surprising that most House Republicans voted to make him speaker anyway. But it is kind of striking that they apparently didn't even insist that he explain himself first.\n\nJordan still will not say that Joe Biden won the 2020 election. And after backing Trump's effort to use Congress to steal that election, Jordan has not publicly vowed to ensure that the House will do its constitutional duty in 2024 if Trump loses and again falsely claims the results were fraudulent.\n\nRepublicans got Jordan to agree to continue farm subsidies. You might expect a few to do the same for American democracy. But that is evidently a lesser concern.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Jim Jordan Unpauses His Speaker Campaign\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, arrives for the Republican caucus meeting at the Capitol in Washington, Thursday, Oct. 19, 2023 Alex Brandon/AP\n\nUpdate, October 19, 2:47 pm ET: Never mind, apparently he's going to try again!\n\nBREAKING - JORDAN says he expects another speaker vote.\n\nSays he wants to meet w the 20 nos.\n\n- Jake Sherman (@JakeSherman) October 19, 2023\n\nUnless Jim Jordan dresses up as the top House Republican for Halloween, it looks like he won't be holding the speaker's gavel anytime soon. After two rounds of voting over the past few days, Jordan failed to scrape together enough support from his fellow Republicans to become speaker of the House. Now, after deciding to forego a third (and likely humiliating) vote, he's instead backing a plan to give increased authority to Rep. Patrick McHenry-who temporarily became speaker after Rep. Kevin McCarthy was ousted-until January 3, according to CBS.\n\nJordan's indignities haven't been limited to the House floor. On Wednesday, during an interview with C-SPAN, Sen. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) blasted Jordan for having failed to pass a single bill as a primary sponsor in his 16 years of being a congressman.\n\n\"We're looking at electing a person who would be second in line to the presidency who's never passed a bill,\" said Romney. \"But he's certainly well known because he's able to make a lot of noise.\"\n\nJordan, a polarizing figure in the GOP,  has definitely made his fair share of noise in the past few years. In 2020, the Ohio representative backed former President Donald Trump's attempts to overturn the election. As my colleague Dan Friedman has reported , many of Jordan's  associates have turned a blind eye to his efforts to dismantle democracy, in favor of what the prospective speaker could theoretically do for them:\n\nSome Republicans who initially balked at backing Jordan agreed to vote for him after he reportedly suggested he would allow passage of the annual farm bill, despite his long record of opposing such legislation. Similarly, Jordan seems to have won some support by indicating to GOP lawmakers that he would not to block legislation providing aid for Ukraine and Israel, meaning the he would allow a bill to pass with bipartisan support, despite his past opposition to supplemental aid for Ukraine.\n\nBut what the Republican converts did not get from Jordan-or, as far we know, even seek-is any explanation regarding his efforts to help Trump retain power after voters elected Joe Biden.\n\nAccording to reports from CBS, Jordan will continue to campaign for speaker until January. However, the real question is: If he ever does win, will he break McCarthy's record of needing 15 rounds of voting to secure the top job? I guess only time will tell.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "House Speaker Fight Shows Election Deniers Who Tried to Overthrow Democracy Still Control GOP\n\nScott Perry (R-Pa.) confers with  Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) during Donald Trump's first impeachment. Susan Walsh/AP\n\nOn the first day of the new Congress, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) delivered one of the nominating speeches for Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who was seeking the House speakership. Jordan bemoaned a \"government that has been weaponized\" against the American people and called for greater accountability. The next day, during a second round of failed votes for McCarthy, Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.), the leader of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, voiced a similar sentiment but in opposing McCarthy: \"Washington is broken... We have an administration that has contempt for the American people.\" Though the two men were on different sides in this battle royal, they were united in hypocrisy, for each of these decriers of abusive power had been collaborators in Donald Trump's public crusade to promote the lies about the 2020 election that led to the January 6 insurrectionist attack on the Capitol and in Trump's devious plotting to overturn the election and upend American democracy.\n\nTheir roles in the House GOP's crapshow illustrated a profound fact largely overlooked in this hullabaloo: The political chaos that brought the House of Representatives to a standstill was being perpetuated by a party that two years earlier had tried to sabotage the republic and had championed falsehoods and conspiracy theories that led to seditious violence in the very chamber where the speakership fight was now occurring. Of the 222 Republicans currently in the House GOP caucus, 119 had on January 6, 2021 , after the Trump-incited riot, affirmed the false charge of a stolen election by voting to block certification of Joe Biden's victory. This group included most of the anti-McCarthy bloc, among them Reps. Andy Biggs, Paul Gosar, Lauren Boebert, Matt Gaetz, and Ralph Norman, who in January 2021 texted then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows that Trump should consider \"Marshall Law\" to remain in office. And this group included McCarthy.\n\nThe GOP civil war in the House was being fought over whether to elevate an election denier who had helped spread the Big Lie that spurred violence to a position that is second in the line of presidential succession. Yet McCarthy's participation in that assault on democracy was not an issue. For Republicans, it was a prerequisite.\n\nThough most Republicans elected to the new Congress share culpability for January 6 and the failed effort to blow up the 2020 election, Perry and Jordan stand out for their significant participation in Trump's anti-constitutional and arguably criminal caper.\n\nThe House January 6 committee's report details Perry as a key conspirator in one of Trump's plots to reverse the election. After the 2020 election was called, Perry was a prominent cheerleader of Trump's fraudulent claim the election had been stolen from him. He was one of 27 Republican House members who signed a letter requesting that Trump \"direct Attorney General Barr to appoint a Special Counsel to investigate irregularities in the 2020 election.\" He attended a December 21 Oval Office meeting with at least 10 other congressional Republicans to discuss a strategy for objecting to the electoral college votes on January 6. And with 125 other House Republicans, he supported Texas' lawsuit that called for throwing out the votes of Pennsylvania and three other states.\n\nBut Perry outdid other GOP election deniers with his behind-the-scenes scheming to corrupt the Justice Department.\n\nIn late December 2020, after Barr resigned (having told Trump privately and stated publicly there was no evidence of any significant electoral fraud), Trump relentlessly leaned on the Justice Department-mainly, Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and his deputy, Richard Donoghue-to affirm his baseless assertion that the election had been rigged. They resisted and repeatedly told Trump the allegations of fraud were untrue. Trump was not getting what he wanted from the department.\n\nThis is where Perry came in. He found a Justice Department official named Jeffrey Clark who was running the Environment and Natural Resources Division. Clark had nothing to do with investigating the allegations of election fraud, but he was willing to echo and legitimize Trump's false charges. Perry introduced Clark to Trump, arranging a meeting between the two in the Oval Office on December 22. As the January 6 committee noted, \"Clark's contact with President Trump violated both Justice Department and White House policies designed to prevent political pressure on the Department.\"\n\nPerry also sent numerous text messages to Meadows urging that Clark be promoted within the department, presumably to a position in which he could compel the Justice Department to assist Trump's bid to retain power. In one message, Perry referred to the upcoming certification of the electoral vote and declared, \"11 days to 1/6... We gotta get going!\"\n\nThough Rosen and Donoghue ordered Clark to have no further contact with Trump, Clark continued to meet with Trump and Perry. Perry also directly confronted the Justice Department about its refusal to back up Trump's false allegations. He called Donoghue on December 27 and assailed the FBI and the department for not finding evidence of election fraud. He added that \"Clark would do something about this.\"\n\nThat night, Perry emailed Donoghue material alleging that election authorities in Pennsylvania had counted 200,000 or so more votes than had been cast-a claim that he and Trump raised publicly. No such thing had happened. Perry was spreading disinformation in an attempt to disenfranchise the voters of his own state.\n\nMeanwhile, Clark-Perry's man at the Justice Department-was pushing an underhanded plan to keep Trump in power. This included proposing to send a letter to the state legislature of Georgia-and those of other swing states-that falsely declared that the Justice Department had \"identified significant concerns that may have impacted the outcome of the election in multiple States, including the State of Georgia.\" The letter recommended that the state legislature call a special session to evaluate potential election fraud. The draft of this letter referred to the fake electors that Trump and his campaign had organized.\n\nWhen Rosen and Donoghue refused to sign this letter, Trump moved to boot Rosen and replace him with Clark. At a combative Oval Office meeting on January 3, Rosen, Donoghue, White House counsel Pat Cipollone and others strenuously opposed Clark's appointment and told Trump it would lead to massive resignations at the department. Only then did Trump retreat on appointing Clark acting attorney general. This attempt to enlist the Justice Department for a coup was over.\n\nThe Trump-Clark scheme, in which Perry was a major plotter, was cited by the House January 6 committee in its final report as one basis for its criminal referral of Trump and others. And apparently Perry had some concerns for his own legal safety. According to the committee, after January 6, he reached out to White House staff and asked to receive a presidential pardon. (He did not receive one.)\n\nIn August, the FBI seized Perry's cell phone, presumably as part of its investigation of the Trump-Clark operation. Perry claimed he was told he was not the subject of an investigation. The January 6 committee subpoenaed Perry, but he refused to show up for a deposition, and the committee subsequently referred him to the House Ethics Committee for sanction for failing to comply with the subpoena.\n\nAs for Jim Jordan, the January 6 committee declared he was \"a significant player in President Trump's efforts.\" It noted:\n\nHe participated in numerous post-election meetings in which senior White House officials, Rudolph Giuliani, and others, discussed strategies for challenging the election, chief among them claims that the election had been tainted by fraud. On January 2, 2021, Representative Jordan led a conference call in which he, President Trump, and other Members of Congress discussed strategies for delaying the January 6th joint session. During that call, the group also discussed issuing social media posts encouraging President Trump's supporters to \"march to the Capitol\" on the 6th.\n\nThe committee's report points out that Jordan was in touch with Meadows and Trump in the days before the January 6 riot. On January 5, he texted Meadows that Vice President Mike Pence should \"call out all the electoral votes that he believes are unconstitutional as no electoral votes at all.\" That is, Jordan was urging an unconstitutional action to achieve a Trump power-grab that would thwart the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nOn January 6, Jordan spoke with Trump at least twice, and, according to the committee, \"he has provided inconsistent public statements about how many times they spoke and what they discussed.\" He also spoke to Rudy Giuliani at least twice in the hours after the riot, as Giuliani continued to encourage members of Congress to block the certification of the election. In the following days, the committee noted, Jordan discussed with White House staffers the prospect of presidential pardons for members of Congress.\n\nLike Perry, Jordan was subpoenaed by the January 6 committee and refused to cooperate, earning a referral to the House Ethics Committee-as did McCarthy. The committee wanted information from McCarthy regarding his conversations with Trump and Pence on and about January 6. He, too, would not cooperate.\n\nAs the McCarthy drama has played out, critical participants have been election deniers who not long ago sought to undermine democracy and whose actions led to the domestic terrorism of January 6. McCarthy's foes, his defenders, and McCarthy himself all were part of the efforts to subvert the Constitution following Biden's victory. Moreover, whatever happens with McCarthy, these enemies of democracy will end up with important positions in the House. Jordan is expected to become chair of the Judiciary Committee. Perry will likely remain chair of the House Freedom Caucus, which will continue as a band of extremists and plague whichever Republican becomes speaker. This absurd speakership fight is a reminder that Republicans who tried to annihilate the constitutional order and who bolstered conspiracy theories and lies that ignited violence have attained power and influence.

      "text": "An Ex-Google Lobbyist Who Backed Jim Jordan Is Leading Big Tech's Bid to Court the Left\n\nGoogle CEO Sundar Pichai testifies before the the Senate Commerce Committee on October 28, 2020. Greg Nash/CNP via ZUMA\n\nHow is Big Tech navigating the Biden era? Consider the newest industry trade group promoting its interests in Washington. Funded by Amazon, Facebook, Google, Twitter, Uber, and other companies, and headed by a veteran tech lobbyist, the Chamber of Progress-a name that plays on the traditionally Republican-leaning Chamber of Commerce-aims to court Democrats and promote \"technology's progressive future.\" The apparent strategy: back key pieces of the Democratic agenda in order to fend off tech regulation.\n\nLaunched last month by Adam Kovacevich, a former government affairs honcho for Google and Lime, Chamber of Progress says it will push for progressive taxation, action on climate change, and the expansion of voting rights. In an interview Wednesday, Kovacevich said the group plans to pursue these goals through steps like hosting events and issuing op-eds.\n\nBehind its general embrace of some progressive policies will be a more straightforward defense of the industry's core interests. The bulk of the group's work will focus on responding to proposed regulation, according to Kovacevich. He wants to thwart what he calls extreme efforts, such as proposals to break up tech companies. He also cites Democrats' support for union organizers at Amazon as a concern. He declined to say how much money the group has raised from the behemoths backing it.\n\nThis outreach to the left comes at a time when Americans are increasingly critical of technology firms. And while Silicon Valley's once-close ties to Democrats frayed years ago, the party's return to power in Washington has left tech outfits, after years of prostrating themselves before conservative critics, scampering to block Democratic regulatory proposals.\n\nThe Chamber of Progress has its eye on influencing centrist Democrats. The group's initial press release included a quote from Rep. Ami Bera (D-Calif.), a member of the pro-business House New Democrat Coalition. \"As the largest caucus of pro-growth Members in Congress, our members support innovation and common-sense regulation,\" Bera said. But Kovacevich says he also wants to engage with progressives. That's tougher. Progressive advocates are sharply critical of the group, deriding its supposed support of liberal causes as ham-handed and cynical.\n\n\"This is clearly kind of an astroturf group, intended to head off policymakers' effort to break up these companies,\" said Sarah Miller, executive director of the American Economic Liberties Project, which calls for dismantling big tech companies.\n\nMiller argues the new group's outreach to the left is too late, coming after many progressives have decided \"that these massive technology companies and their business models are fundamentally incompatible with democracy.\" Tech giants championing voting rights won't change that, she said. \"Maybe it would have been effective a year ago,\" Miller added. \"But now, good luck.\"\n\nPart of the problem critics have with the group is Kovacevich himself. He boasts a resume that almost seems tailored to alienate progressives. He touts his past work for former Sen. Joe Lieberman, even as he courts activists still seething over Lieberman's brand of sanctimonious centrism a decade after he retired.\n\nWhile an undergrad at Harvard in 1997, Kovacevich campaigned successfully for an end to a five-year old ban on grapes in the university's dining halls. The ban had been imposed to support historic boycotts waged by the United Farm Workers to protest labor conditions for grape-pickers. Kovacevich, the son of a California table grape grower , said at the time that other students who supported the ban misunderstand conditions on farms.\n\nAlso at Harvard, Kovacevich befriended a classmate named Tom Cotton, and he later supported Cotton in his successful campaigns for the House and Senate campaigns, in 2012 and 2014 respectively. He even joined Cotton on the campaign trail in Arkansas in November 2014. Cotton has since taken increasingly far right-some say fascist -positions, including his infamous call last year for former President Donald Trump to \"Send in the Troops\" to \"restore order\" in cities where Black Lives Matter protests had resulted in looting and violence. Asked if he still supports Cotton, Kovacevich sidestepped: \"I support him as a friend, but that doesn't mean we agree on policies.\"\n\nDuring his 12-years leading Google's public policy efforts, Kovacevich oversaw an expansion of the search giant's lobbying. Starting in 2011, he also courted conservatives to help Google fight off a Federal Trade Commission probe into the company's search and advertising practices and other regulatory proposals.\n\nAfter Trump's election, Kovacevich led an effort, he later said, \"to build deeper relationships\" between Google and the GOP. He contributed in 2018 to the campaigns of Republicans including far-right Trump favorite Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who went on to act as a key promotor of false election fraud claims that Republicans are now using to attack voting rights.\n\nIn a 2018 meeting later reported on by Wired , Kovacevich touted support from then-House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.). He called the conservative one of the company's \"most helpful champions,\" despite stances on guns and immigration that Kovacevich said \"are probably not ones many Googlers would support.\" That pragmatic assessment of Goodlatte's value presaged Kovacevich's current outreach to Democrats.\n\nIn 2018, Google sponsored a reception at the Conservative Political Action Conference, even though critics accused the conference of welcoming \"white nationalists\" and other extremists. Kovacevich defended the sponsorship as a means to court \"the people who influence\" lawmakers and build goodwill with Republicans.\n\nKovacevich was also involved in a Google project to fund academics and think tankers who were making arguments favorable to the company. Google in 2017 and 2018 gave $500,000 to the Global Antitrust Institute at the libertarian-leaning George Mason University's law school. Facebook and Amazon also helped fund the center, which has churned ou t policy papers favorable to tech giants and sent several professors to jobs at the FTC.\n\nJeff Hauser, director of the Revolving Door Project at the Center for Economic and Policy Research, described Kovacevich as \"an innovative force in Washington for blurring the lines between corporate lobbying and ostensibly public-interest minded academic work.\" That background \"makes this new leap by Adam both logical and risible,\" Hauser said.\n\nKovacevich, who left Google amid a 2019 shakeup of its lobbying operation, defends his outreach to Republicans and academics as a part of his job. \"I worked with Republicans and Democrats and promoted policies that benefited Google and its users,\" he said.\n\nCritics argue that given his background, Kovacevich's prominent role with the new group demonstrates the arrogance of powerful companies that hope to buy political support for policies that affect their bottom line with superficial support of issues it costs them little to back.\n\n\"There is no evidence that this guy is progressive, no evidence that tech companies are going to put any energy or money or muscle or attention to supporting progressive causes,\" said Mike Lux, board chair for American Family Voices , a nonprofit advocating progressive economic policies.\n\nMeanwhile, Kovacevich said he is is eager \"to really get engaged in some of the intra-Democratic debates\" about technology regulation. In that regard, he is off to a good start.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg Sues Jim Jordan to Block Meddling in Trump Case\n\nFormer President Donald Trump embraces Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio at a rally in November 2022. Michael Conroy/AP\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has filed a lawsuit against Congressman Jim Jordan, telling the Ohio Republican to back off the DA's case against Donald Trump.\n\nEven before a New York grand jury officially indicted Trump, Jordan and other top House Republicans were threatening Bragg with an investigation of their own, apparently aimed at helping defend the former president.\n\nBragg's lawsuit, filed Tuesday in federal court, asks a judge to block a subpoena that Jordan issued to attorney Mark Pomerantz, who left Bragg's office last year. Bragg also wants the judge to prohibit Jordan from continuing to \"harass\" the Manhattan prosecutor's office.\n\nBack on March 20-well before Bragg's grand jury indicted Trump on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records-Jordan, who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, and two other Republicans sent Bragg a letter accusing him of leading a politically motivated investigation into Trump. The Republicans demanded that Bragg provide Congress with details of his probe. Jordan argued that Bragg's interest in prosecuting Trump-\"while adopting progressive criminal justice policies that allow career 'criminals [to] run[ ] the streets' of Manhattan-requires congressional scrutiny about how public safety funds appropriated by Congress are implemented by local law-enforcement agencies.\"\n\nLast week, Jordan also subpoenaed Pomerantz, a longtime white collar crime prosecutor who Bragg's predecessor, Cy Vance Jr., had brought into the DA's office to help investigate any potential Trump-related crimes. Pomerantz quit after Bragg took over, citing frustrations with Bragg's initial unwillingness to pursue criminal charges against Trump. Pomerantz later wrote a book about his decision and his belief that Trump has committed numerous crimes.\n\nJordan has also taken to both television and Twitter to attack Bragg.\n\nAlvin Bragg allowed Charles Lindsay, a notorious gang member, to walk free from four felony charges if Lindsay attended five \"counseling sessions.\"\n\nBut if you're a Republican running for president, you're held to a different standard of \"justice.\"\n\n- Rep. Jim Jordan (@Jim_Jordan) April 1, 2023\n\nIn a Fox News interview, Jordan even threatened to subpoena Bragg himself and warned that if Bragg resisted, \" everything is on the table. \"\n\nBragg and Jordan have continued to trade jabs-Jordan has said he wants to hold a Judiciary Committee hearing in Manhattan to highlight what he believes are high crime rates, while a Bragg aide countered that cities in Jordan's home state had higher crime rates.\n\nBragg's lawsuit is an escalation in the back-and-forth, however, with the request that a federal judge force Jordan to drop his subpoena of Pomerantz. In the complaint, Bragg points out that he's a local prosecutor and that Congress has no power to interfere with local criminal investigations. What Jordan and his GOP colleagues are really doing, Bragg says in the suit, is trying to create \"a retaliatory political circus designed to undermine the rule of law and New York's police power.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Jim Jordan Is Lying About Voting Rights\n\nAlex Brandon/AP\n\nLast week, Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) sent an alarming email to his supporters. Jordan, who is one of Donald Trump's most vocal defenders on Capitol Hill, warned that Obama-era Attorney General Eric Holder is on the cusp of using the courts to \"steal\" his congressional seat and replace him with a \"radical liberal.\" He asked readers for \"$25 or more\" to \"fight this liberal scheme.\"\n\nThere's just one problem: It wasn't true.\n\n\"Since Obama left office...Holder has been focusing his energy on the National Democratic Redistricting Committee (NDRC) , a liberal group whose goal is to steal Conservative seats in Congress, not at the ballot box, but in the courts,\" Jordan's January 1 email read. \"And now his sights are set on me!! Recently, three judges struck down Ohio's Congressional map, stating that all Ohio Congressional districts must be redrawn before next year, including mine!\"\n\nThe legal battle Jordan was describing-a challenge to Ohio's heavily gerrymandered congressional map-really did happen. But it ended months ago after the Supreme Court's controversial ruling that the judiciary could not intervene in such cases. The Ohio map will remain in place. Jordan omitted that fact entirely from his fundraising pitch.\n\n\"Rep. Jordan's claim that Ohio's congressional districts must be redrawn before next year is incorrect,\" says Corey Goldstone, spokesperson for the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan watchdog organization.\n\nHere's the backstory: In May 2018, the ACLU of Ohio filed a federal lawsuit alleging that Ohio's congressional maps amounted to unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering. A year later, in May 2019, a three-judge panel for the Southern District of Ohio ruled that the state's districts had indeed been gerrymandered to favor Republicans, whose majority status in state government means that they control the redistricting process. The judges set a June 14 deadline for the state to redraw the lines.\n\nBut the voting-rights victory was short-lived. Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, a Republican, appealed the case to the Supreme Court, which had recently heard similar arguments in gerrymandering cases from Maryland and North Carolina. In June, the Supreme Court delivered a 5-4 ruling in the Maryland and North Carolina cases, declaring that partisan gerrymandering cannot be challenged in federal court. That decision would reverberate in similar legal fights across the country, including Ohio. In October, the Supreme Court formally tossed out the challenge to Ohio's Republican-drawn map. Thanks to that ruling, Ohio's congressional map will not be redrawn until the census results are released prior to the 2022 election cycle-and the state's Republicans will once again have the ability to shape districts that give them a substantial advantage.\n\nFor many Democrats and voting rights advocates, the Supreme Court ruling was a huge blow in the fight to redraw districts around the nation that had been created to stack the deck in favor of one party, usually Republicans. Here's what Mother Jones' Ari Berman and Pema Levy wrote when that decision came out:\n\nThough both parties have done their fair share of gerrymandering, Republicans did it in far more places over the past decade. In 2010, Republicans took control of nearly every major swing state and oversaw the redistricting process for four times as many state legislative seats as Democrats, giving them a virtual lock on power for the remainder of the decade. Republicans were able to hold onto an additional 16 congressional seats and seven state legislative chambers in 2018 because of these skewed maps, according to an Associated Press analysis .\n\nIn Ohio, Republicans received 52 percent of the vote in the 2018 congressional elections but won 75 percent of the state's 16 congressional seats, thanks to the gerrymandered map. Jordan, who touts himself as being \"one of the most conservative members of Congress,\" won the sprawling 4th district-which is often pointed to as one of the state's most gerrymandered -by more than 30 points.\n\nBut one would never know that from Jordan's fundraising email. \"The Democrats are leaping with joy, because with a stroke of the pen they could flip critical seats in Congress and maintain Nancy Pelosi's majority!!\" it says, before asking supporters to \"make a generous donation of at least $25 today to help fight back.\"\n\n\"Beyond the questionable claims made in Rep. Jordan's fundraising email, he seems dismissive of the obvious conflict of interest presented by politicians redrawing district maps more generally,\" Goldstone notes. To curb partisan gerrymandering, there have been increasing calls for states to adopt independent redistricting commissions, a reform that Holder's NDRC has supported .\n\nJordan's campaign didn't respond to a request for comment, but he's clearly not a fan of independent commissions. \"Holder and the Democrats know they can't win in a fair fight,\" he wrote in the fundraising email, \"that's why having unelected and unaccountable commissions potentially drawing the congressional lines excites them so much.\"\n\nGoldstone disagrees. \"Gerrymandering is a serious problem facing our democracy,\" he says. \"Independent redistricting commissions are a reform supported by 60 percent of Democrats, Independents and Republicans.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Whistleblower: GOP Investigators Didn't Want to Hear Allegations of Russian Influence Over Rudy\n\nRep. Kweisi Mfume, D-Md., and other Democrats pushed Republicans to subpoena Rudy Giuliani during a House impeachment inquiry hearing. Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n\nHouse Republicans really don't want to hear from Rudy Giuliani.\n\nThough their impeachment crusade grew out of the former New York City mayor's anti-Biden machinations, the GOP-led House Oversight Committee spent much of Thursday's impeachment inquiry hearing voting down repeated efforts by Democrats to subpoena Giuliani and Lev Parnas, his former sidekick.\n\nBut Republican attempts to limit what they hear about Giuliani's activities apparently go further than a few committee votes, according to an FBI whistleblower. In a memo obtained by Mother Jones , Johnathan Buma-an FBI agent who says he conducted foreign influence investigations- alleges that investigators working for House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan told him in June that they were not interested in what he knew about Giuliani potentially being \" compromised \" by Russian intelligence while working as Donald Trump's personal lawyer.\n\nThe memo suggests that Republican investigators privately imposed the same fact-finding limitations Democrats highlighted on Thursday: GOP lawmakers say they want to investigate allegations about Joe Biden, but they appear reluctant to scrutinize the origin of their own probe or turn up details that undermine their preferred narrative. Judiciary Committee staff dispute Buma's allegations, telling Mother Jones that his account of his interactions with House investigators isn't accurate. (The Judiciary and Ways and Means Committees are working on the Biden investigation with the House Oversight Committee, which held Thursday's hearing.)\n\nAs Insider , the New Yorker and others have previously reported, Buma-who originally filed a whistleblower complaint with the FBI last year-submitted a statement to the House Judiciary Committee in April 2023. He sent another statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee in July. (Here is Buma's full statement to the House committee, which recently became public.)\n\nIn both statements, the active FBI agent said that his own experience belied claims by GOP lawmakers that the Justice Department obstructed efforts to investigate Hunter Biden while more zealously probing Donald Trump and Trump's allies. Buma, who says he personally developed leads that helped launch federal probes into Hunter Biden, said his bureau bosses welcomed his Hunter-related information. By contrast, Buma says, his efforts to investigate potential Russian influence over Giuliani were thwarted by FBI higher-ups during both the Trump administration and the Biden administration. The FBI declined to comment on his claims.\n\nBuma, as Mother Jones has reported , said in his July statement that he learned that Pavel Fuks, a wealthy Ukrainian developer who hired Giuliani in 2017, paid Giuliani $300,000, supposedly for security consulting work. But Buma says that the FBI suspected Fuks was a \"co-opted asset\" of a Russian intelligence service and that his payments were potentially part of an effort to gain influence over Giuliani, who in 2018 became Trump's personal lawyer.\n\nFuks denies working for Russia. \"Mr. Fuks has never cooperated with Russian intelligence,\" a spokesperson says. A Giuliani spokesperson did not respond to questions about Buma's account.\n\nGiuliani working for a Russian agent would be an obvious security risk. Buma's allegations are an additional data point, among many, suggesting that America' Mayor may have been manipulated by Russian agents as he scoured Ukraine for political dirt that could damage Trump's top rival.\n\nThe memo Mother Jones obtained is Buma's account of his interactions with the House Judiciary Committee's Republican staff. It details a June 14, 2023, phone call during which Buma made his case to two former FBI agents working for the committee.\n\nBuma writes that after one of the ex-agents referred to the FBI supposedly \"slow playing\" its Biden probe, \"I explained that I was perhaps the first FBI Agent to collect and report information from Ukrainian sources concerning Hunter Biden.\" Buma says he told the investigators that his FBI superiors were \"happy to receive the information\" and that \"I never experienced any intelligence suppression when I collected and reported information concerning the Bidens.\"\n\nBuma reports that he then described information he received indicating that Giuliani had \"collected money from a Ukrainian agent who had been co-opted by the Russian Intelligence Service, Pavlo Fuks..., as well as a group of political operatives located in California, in and around 2020. I said that reporting concerning Giuliani was corroborated extensively by follow up investigations.\"\n\nBuma says he told the investigators that \"my reporting concerning Giuliani and those surrounding Giuliani was suppressed and my reputation was also blackballed.\" That's when the committee staffers cut him off, according to Buma: \"When I tried to explain what was actually going on in Ukraine and where I actually experienced suppression, [the investigators] interjected and said that they were only interested in matters pertaining to Biden.\"\n\nA Judiciary committee spokesperson said the staffers involved remembered the phone call differently. \"This is not an accurate depiction and misrepresents the Committee's exchanges with Mr. Buma,\" the aide said. \"Their discussions with Mr. Buma covered a wide range of topics under the Committee's purview, including the FBI and Hunter Biden.\"\n\nThe spokesperson did not specify exactly what the committee disputed. Still, in Buma's account, committee staffers were explicit: They only wanted to hear about the Bidens. That suggests they didn't want to consider evidence indicating that a key adviser to Trump might have been compromised by Russian agents. And they didn't want to deal with the possibility that the president's lawyer was used to pass along phony claims that helped launch the investigation House Republicans are now pursuing.\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the Oversight Committee, said at Thursday's hearing that lawmakers should hear from Giuliani because he an author \"of the lie on which this sham impeachment is based.\" Republicans clearly contest that, but they don't seem too interested in the details of how their investigation really got started.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Prior attempts by Jordan to obtain information from Bragg's office have been met with criticism that he's not respecting the role of local government in federalism.\n\nBut Trump has been grumbling lately that his allies in Washington aren't doing enough to come to his defense, prompting a recent parade of supporters to his Manhattan courtroom to show support.\n\nJordan has also stepped up his demands from prosecutors charging Trump.\n\nIn his recent letter, Jordan asserted that the record \"demonstrates his obsession with investigating a person rather than prosecuting a crime.\"\n\n\"The fact that a former senior Biden Justice Department official-whose previous employment consisted of leading 'a wave of state litigation against Trump administration policies'-is now leading the prosecution of President Biden's chief political rival only adds to the perception that the Biden Justice Department is politicized and weaponized,\" Jordan said.\n\nBragg, a Democrat, announced in late 2022 that Colangelo was joining his office as part of the team investigating Trump in the hush money case.\n\nTrump has lashed out at Colangelo directly, charging this year that the case against him \"is all Biden-run things, meaning Biden and his thugs, because I don't know if he knows he's alive. And it's a shame what's happening to our country.\"\n\nTrump and his allies have said federal prosecutors are waging a campaign against him to hamper his political prospects.\n\nTrump is charged with 34 counts of falsifying business records related to the payments Cohen paid. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\nEarly in the trial, Trump grumbled privately that he was not seeing the public defense that he expected from his close allies as he sat for hours every day in a frigid Manhattan courtroom, gagged by an order from the judge to stop him from attacking witnesses and others in the case.\n\n\"No one is defending me,\" Trump said at the time.\n\nIncreasingly, Trump's allies are delivering the attacks that he is unable to launch himself.\n\nBragg has denied Trump's allegations that the indictment is politically motivated.\n\nJordan's letter also seeks communications among Colangelo and the New York and Fulton County, Georgia, district attorneys' offices, the Justice Department, the Democratic National Committee and the Biden for President campaign.\n\nIt also requests \"[a]ll personnel files related to Mr. Colangelo's hiring, employment, and termination at the New York Attorney General's Office.\"\n\nTrump is under indictments in Fulton County and by special counsel Jack Smith's office at the Justice Department stemming from charges related to his efforts to stay in office after the 2020 presidential election. Trump has pleaded not guilty in those cases.\n\nKatherine Doyle is a White House reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

      "text": "Jim Jordan wants to be speaker but hasn't even mastered the basics\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nThe House held just one vote for speaker on Tuesday afternoon, and Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, lost handily. Twenty Republicans voted against him, a really big hurdle to overcome when you consider that there's word that he may lose another five or six Republicans' support on the second ballot. For someone trying to win a job that mostly revolves around keeping track of votes, that doesn't bode well for him.\n\nIt's also not great when there's already worry a Speaker Jordan might not be a help raising funds to support House candidates. Neither development is particularly surprising when one considers that Jordan isn't particularly good at the basics of being a lawmaker, let alone at the more complicated skills it takes to become speaker. There are three main jobs members of Congress have: writing and passing laws, providing a check and balance on the other branches, and serving their constituents. Jordan, amazingly, is bad at all three.\n\nNeither development is particularly surprising when one considers that Jordan isn't particularly good at the basics of being a lawmaker,\n\nLegislating is the most obvious job a representative has, but since being sworn into the House in 2006, Jordan has been famously lacking on that front . As The Washington Post's Aaron Blake pointed out Monday, Jordan has had precisely zero bills signed into law , or even passed in the House, with most getting absolutely no traction. That's pretty abysmal when you consider that two of those years of his legislative invisibility came when there was a GOP trifecta in Washington. He did nothing to advance his agenda through the law despite his cachet with former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe 36 bills that Jordan has introduced in 16 years haven't exactly been winners, either. Only three were agreed to by the House. And while the number of bills that become law has dwindled in general, Jordan has never seemed particularly dedicated to taking part in the process.\n\nJordan pays a lot of lip service to government oversight, but his record is decidedly poor, especially when a Republican is in office. Many of his early years in the House were spent riding the wave of tea party anger at former President Barack Obama and blaming him for out-of-control spending (even though it's Congress that appropriates money) and demanding strict oversight of the executive branch. He spent most of his time in Congress on the House Oversight Committee , where he made a name for himself with his aggressive questioning of Obama administration officials.\n\nThat conviction evaporated in 2017, though, as he suddenly became a proponent of \"executive privilege\" and rejecting legislative oversight - at least when it came to Trump. Jordan was specifically tapped during Trump's first impeachment to be the House GOP's official gadfly at hearings, chiding Democrats for daring to question a sitting president's motives. And as I wrote Tuesday , he was working hand in hand with Trump and his allies to try to keep the former president in office after he lost the 2020 election.\n\nSince Republicans returned the majority this year, Jordan has framed his position as the chair of the Judiciary Committee as a bulwark against the supposed \"weaponization\" of federal law enforcement against conservatives. The weaponization subcommittee, which he also chairs, was much hyped at the beginning of the year, but it has fizzled since then , with some observers dismissing his efforts as early as March. In total, the subcommittee has had five hearings this year , the last of which was in July and produced no damning evidence. Instead, the committee has chased whatever thing conservatives on X are mad about on a particular day. His efforts to investigate President Joe Biden and prove that there was some kind of Justice Department cover-up to protect his son Hunter have fared little better .\n\nIt also bears mentioning that Jordan has held no hearings on the Supreme Court following recent revelations about Justice Clarence Thomas' acceptance of lavish gifts from a billionaire. There has likewise been no call from Jordan for a Supreme Court code of ethics or any assertion that Congress has the power to impose one. If Jordan really cared about oversight of the other branches, this issue would be right in his wheelhouse.\n\nBut how much credit should Jordan get for spending much of his time on Fox News deliberately misleading his constituents about things like supposed fraud in the 2020 election?\n\nJordan's performance on the third front, serving his constituents as their representative, is a bit harder to judge. On one hand, the counties that make up Ohio's 4th Congressional District are overwhelmingly white , and almost all of them supported Trump by wide margins in the 2020 election. So, in one sense, he's reflecting many of his voters' views with his rabble-rousing and support for the MAGA movement. But how much credit should Jordan get for spending much of his time on Fox News deliberately misleading his constituents about things like supposed fraud in the 2020 election?\n\nFor a more objective metric, we can look at how much federal spending he has brought home since he has been in office. Jordan has never been a fan of earmarks , and to his credit, he hasn't taken part in the recently revived earmark system in the House, now referred to as \"Community Project Funding,\" in any of the last three years. But even without them, the amount of funding going to Jordan's district from fiscal year 2008, which began during Jordan's first term in Congress, to fiscal year 2023 has tripled, according to USASpending.gov .\n\nAmong the biggest-ticket items last year in Jordan's district, which receives similar amounts of spending per capita as nearby parts of Ohio, were payments for Social Security benefits, Medicare prescription drug coverage and defense contracts signed with companies that have factories within the district's borders. The state also received more than $3 billion last year in funding for the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, also known as food stamps. I note all this because one of Jordan's main goals as speaker would be to trigger major across-the-board spending cuts that would slash billions of dollars from military spending and SNAP alike. Would that be in the best interest of his constituents?\n\nIn contrast, there are two jobs that Jordan has excelled at as a member of Congress: promoting Jim Jordan and keeping other people from doing their jobs. He has spent most of his eight terms standing in the way of new laws' passing, opposing federal funding to needy communities and running defense for the likes of Trump. In doing so, he has made himself the face of a movement more dedicated to breaking things than building them. Small wonder, then, that he now finds himself unable to build a winning coalition.\n\nHayes Brown is a writer and editor for MSNBC Daily, where he helps frame the news of the day for readers.

      "text": "The problem(s) with Jim Jordan's pursuit of a N.Y. prosecutor\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nBy Steve Benen\n\nIt was a couple of weeks ago when House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan sat down with Fox News' Maria Bartiromo, and the conservative host expressed her frustration with the House Republicans' seemingly endless parade of inconsequential investigations .\n\nAs the two discussed Donald Trump's ongoing criminal trial in New York, Bartiromo told the Ohio Republican, \"Well, look, I mean, at this point, American citizens are asking, 'What can you do about it?' I mean, look, with all due respect, people are sick and tired of congressional investigations that go nowhere.\"\n\nIn context, the Fox host wasn't suggesting that GOP lawmakers end pointless partisan probes; Bartiromo was instead suggesting that Jordan and his partisan allies start launching more productive partisan probes.\n\nSoon after, the Judiciary Committee chairman demanded information from the Justice Department about Matthew Colangelo, a former Justice Department official who's now involved in prosecuting Donald Trump's hush-money case. Two weeks later, as NBC News reported , Jordan has taken another related step.\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan is demanding documents from the New York attorney general related to the hiring of a lead prosecutor in Donald Trump's hush money trial. Jordan, R-Ohio, accused Matthew Colangelo, who is a former high-ranking official in Attorney General Letitia James' office, of assisting in what he called Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's \"politicized prosecution\" as Trump stands trial in New York.\n\nThe report added that Jordan is also seeking communications among Colangelo and the New York and Fulton County, Georgia, district attorneys' offices, the Justice Department, the Democratic National Committee, and President Joe Biden's re-election campaign.\n\nChances are, most of the public has never heard of Colangelo, though your weird uncle who consumes conservative media all day is very likely aware of him.\n\nAs regular readers know , Colangelo served as a former senior Justice Department official with a long history of taking on Donald Trump, including having led the investigation that led to the shutdown of Trump's fraudulent charitable foundation . When he joined district attorney Alvin Bragg's team in 2022, it was evidence of an intensifying investigation into the former president's alleged crimes.\n\nConservative conspiracy theorists, however, came to believe Colangelo's work in the Manhattan district attorney's office was actually evidence of the Biden administration secretly pulling the strings in the hush money case, as part of an elaborate election plot against Trump.\n\nIt's this conspiracy theory that Jordan is now taking seriously - or at least pretending to take seriously - as evidenced by the Ohioan's latest outreach to the New York attorney general's office.\n\nBy all appearances, Jordan's newest efforts to investigate an investigation - one of the Judiciary Committee chairman's most unfortunate habits - will probably not amount to much, in part because the conspiracy theory appears to be baseless, and in part because state and local officials will almost certainly ignore Jordan's requests. He has no jurisdiction over their work, which helps explain why the far-right congressman's latest efforts to intervene in an ongoing criminal case will fail.\n\nBut what's especially notable about the developments is the degree to which the Republican congressman was effectively bullied into pursuing the conspiracy theory in the first place.\n\nMedia Matters recently explained in a report , \"Pro-Trump media figures alleged that Colangelo is a 'partisan hatchet man' and claimed that his past service in the Justice Department ... proves that Trump's indictment was a 'political hit by Biden to take out Trump.' In reality, Colangelo had unique experience for Bragg because he led the New York attorney general's civil inquiry into Trump before joining the Justice Department, and it is not unusual for lawyers to leave DOJ for senior roles in the Manhattan DA's office.\"\n\nNevertheless, Steve Bannon took an especially keen interest in the matter, boasting that he intended to \" force \" Jordan to take the right's Colangelo theories seriously.\n\n\"We're already working behind the scenes and we're going to force Jordan to do that because all Jordan's given, and you can talk to the Trump team, all he's done is happy talk,\" Bannon told his listeners earlier this month, adding that Jordan has produced a series of \"air balls\" (a basketball term referring to shots that don't hit anything).\n\n\"You must take action,\" Bannon added. \"I shouldn't have to take valuable airtime here, that we have so many other things to get to hound you. To hound you. To hound you. Because if you don't have a bayonet to the back of these guys, they're going to backslide on everything, you know why? Because they're gutless.\"\n\n\"It's called controlled opposition,\" Bannon concluded . \"[Jordan will] go on Hannity and talk about some stuff, right? But nothing happens and this has got to happen.\"\n\nDays later, Jordan demanded that the U.S. attorney general's office provide his panel with evidence related to the Colangelo conspiracy theory - Bannon was pleased by the \"start\" - followed by the congressman making similar demands of the New York attorney general's office.\n\nWhen Jordan took over as chair of the Judiciary Committee, it stood to reason that far-right voices would help call the shots. I didn't realize, however, just how easily he'd be bullied into submission .\n\nThis post updates our related earlier coverage .\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

      "text": "Jim Jordan shows how Trump would pressure private companies to do his bidding\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nBy Ja'han Jones\n\nRep. Jim Jordan is showing Americans how Donald Trump would pressure private businesses, especially in news and social media, to do his bidding if he wins a second term.\n\nAs chair of the House Judiciary Committee, the Ohio Republican is attempting to coerce news outlets, social media platforms, and advertisers into submitting to conservative demands - offering a blueprint for an even more aggressive push for control by an empowered Trump.\n\nIn his most recent attack, Jordan has gone on the offense against CBS News, the kind of mainstream media organization that Trump loves to accuse of treating him unfairly simply by doing basic journalism. Jordan has done so by seizing on CBS News' decision to lay off reporter Catherine Herridge in February, scheduling a hearing for next week .\n\nA former Fox News reporter, Herridge was among the reporters who promoted debunked claims about President Joe Biden's alleged involvement in a foreign influence scheme, being especially credulous about a politically motivated report from Senate Republicans and earning praise from Trump for it. Naturally, conservatives see nefarious motives, with Jordan framing the end of her employment as a suppression of \"free speech\" and claiming that CBS \"seized\" her files.\n\nThe organization denied the seizure claims, saying it delivered her personal belongings to her home and kept her files in her office untouched. \"We have respected her request to not go through the files, and out of our concern for confidential sources, the office she occupied has remained secure since her departure,\" read a statement from CBS to TVNewser. A representative from the union SAG-AFTRA later monitored the return of her reporting notes. Jordan is giving Herridge a chance to speak at the hearing while also demanding information from CBS about who decided to let her go and whether anyone went through her files after she left.\n\nHerridge has so far not commented publicly other than sharing a statement from a veterans' group praising her past journalism on social media and another from SAG-AFTRA about her files.\n\nHundreds of journalists have been laid off in recent months as the news industry continues to be roiled by changing market conditions. Some were, no doubt, working on important investigations into all kinds of powerful interests at the time. But Jordan's decision to highlight Herridge is not an attempt to support journalism but to undermine it, framing this one particular reporter as the target of some broad but unnamed media conspiracy against conservatives.\n\nIt fits a pattern with Jordan's other recent efforts. Late last month, we saw him put pressure on major advertising companies that have tried to prevent ads from being placed alongside content or on platforms known for spreading misinformation. In Jordan's letter to these ad companies' railing against their anti-disinformation stance, he suggests they've been deliberately trying to \"demonetize\" conservatives in defiance of antitrust laws. And he's also targeted social media platforms for moderating hate speech and disinformation , alleging this, too, is part of some conspiracy against Republicans.\n\nThis is what it looks like for the federal government to actually target private industries. And if all this sounds disturbing to you (which it should), keep in mind that this is what Jordan is doing when he has little power. If Trump is re-elected and Republicans retake the Senate, Jordan will have a lot of powerful allies in these schemes to try to influence the news and social media that Americans consume.\n\nCORRECTION (April 9, 2024, 12:19 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated the committee that Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, chairs. It is the House Judiciary Committee, not the House Oversight Committee.\n\nJa'han Jones is an MSNBC opinion blogger. He previously wrote The ReidOut Blog.

They needed the extra time because there was so much to do. Representative Elise Stefanik, the enterprising young New Yorker who serves in the House leadership, said in July that President Joe Biden not only had corrupt relationships with criminals and foreign adversaries but that \"Joe Biden profited from that.\" Not surprisingly, Stefanik said, \"We intend to investigate.\" For his part, House Judiciary Committee chairman Jim Jordan promised that the treachery of Democrats and the deep state at last would be exposed, including a Department of Justice that \"treats parents as terrorists \" and social media companies that secretly work with Democrats to censor conservatives. Jordan, who is now chairman of a subcommittee on the \"weaponization\" of government against conservatives, previewed even more nefarious skulduggery. There were, he said, \"dozens\" of federal whistleblowers who were prepared to blow the lid off the deep state, including at least 14 inside the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Those FBI witnesses would show how the agency was used to thwart Donald Trump and other conservatives. Indeed, once word of the hearings got out, the army of whistleblowers grew. By January, Jordan had revised the number of FBI whistleblowers up to 19. (Senator Joseph McCarthy's numbers tended to jump around too.)

Where are those witnesses, Mr. Chairman? Let's bring them in. Bring them in right here so that the American people can see for themselves what the entire basis of this subcommittee is.\" If a lowly freshman is taunting you in public, it's generally a sign that you're having a bad week. The stalled Republican scandal industry is a bit of a mystery. As the Monongahela Valley once was to the manufacture of steel out of fire, House Republicans were to the fashioning of scandal out of innuendo.

Yet so far neither Jordan nor his colleague James Comer, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, seem able to manufacture a political hit for a new era. Clearly something about the GOP or the larger political context has changed. After all, it's not as if all the scandalmonger jobs were exported to China (although Russia did gain market share in 2016). Even Fox News, a vital partner in the scandal-industrial complex, has expressed disappointment with the new product line. \"I think the House Republicans have put on such a clown show that the credibility of a traditional Congressional hearing has been woefully devalued and diluted,\" said former Republican consultant Mike Murphy in an e-mail. \"Brand counts. Plus, the Jan. 6 hearings set a high bar for the optics of doing it correctly, and these jokers just cannot compete.\" If the market for political fantasy has changed, Jordan doesn't seem to have caught on. Or perhaps Jordan simply can't settle on a coherent narrative. Last week, he brought in two witnesses who spouted off and then promptly hustled out of the room-before Democrats could ask a single question. It was not a display of confidence. There was a time when Republicans could count on the mainstream media to amplify whatever was brewing in the fever swamps. But after so much yowling about magic stolen votes and the crucifixion of MAGA Jesus by Pontius Biden, that's become a shakier bet. Even the most absorbent polity eventually reaches a saturation point. After torrents of bad faith, neither the news media nor the non-MAGA public appears eager to keep mopping it up. News of Trump's indictment last week prompted a new round of baseless attacks -this time on New York prosecutor Alvin Bragg-from Jordan and other House Republicans. As Jordan grows more desperate to produce a viable scandal, let alone evidence of the Biden crime spree described by Stefanik, it's not hard to imagine him unwittingly inviting the kind of capstone that Army lawyer Joseph Welch provided to McCarthy's 1954 hearings on subversives in the military. McCarthy's corruption had by then been well established; Welch just affixed a public label to it. Jordan is currently threatening to pursue experts on disinformation and force them to testify before his committee. That is, Jordan is considering subjecting himself, in public, to the testimony of professionals who make their living studying bad actors who spread falsehoods. It's certainly an intriguing proposition. It would be good for the public to learn more about political disinformation.

Things were bad enough this time last week, when the intra-caucus revolt led by Florida Representative Matt Gaetz knocked Kevin McCarthy out of his House speakership . In addition to heightening the prospect of a government shutdown after the continuing resolution on spending expires in just over a month, the motion-to-vacate vote also threw the funding of the war effort in Ukraine into doubt. That major spending outlay was stripped out of the final version of the resolution, with McCarthy allegedly agreeing with House Democrats to bring it up for a separate vote later. With McCarthy now gone, no one can say for sure how or whether Ukraine spending gets back on track.\n\nAnd now, of course, Hamas's attacks on Israel-with Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu retaliating from a full-war footing-make the self-inflicted chaos atop the House a still more fraught, and poorly timed, abdication . On Monday, the House GOP conference convened to assess the likeliest outcomes for Wednesday's scheduled vote for a new speaker, but the proceedings just served to confirm what everybody already knew: It's a specter with few good outcomes in play, for either the party or the country. The leading candidates to succeed McCarthy are majority leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana and Judiciary Committee chair Jim Jordan of Ohio. Both are deep-red MAGA apostles; both won't acknowledge that the 2020 election results were legitimate.\n\nJordan was an active plotter of the failed January 6 coup who is still in defiance of his subpoena to appear for the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack. So within the demented sanctums of Republican Party power, Scalise comes off as a more measured institutionalist for simply lying and grandstanding about the insurrection. On the other hand, Scalise has suffered from past association with fellow Louisianan and former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan David Duke; he spoke before a 2002 conference of a Duke-founded white nationalist group, and once told a New Orleans Times-Picayune reporter that he saw himself as \" David Duke without the baggage .\" He has claimed the latter comment was misinterpreted (without managing to explain just what the unseen layers of nuance in a Duke analogy might be), while insisting he knew nothing about the actual makeup of the group that sponsored his 2002 talk. (This dodge, too, doesn't pass the sniff test, especially since the group in question was named the European Unity and Rights Organization, or EURO.)\n\nWith these front-runners making the speaker vote the dictionary definition of a Hobson's choice, it's not surprising that McCarthy himself, ever alert to new possibilities to humiliate himself in the quest for power, is already indicating that he'd again be available to take up the speakership in the not-at-all unlikely event of a deadlocked vote. This scenario isn't instantly far-fetched; after all, taking absences in the House into account, Gaetz and his allies hit upon exactly the minimum vote total to vacate McCarthy's speakership-which means that it would take but one anti-McCarthy balloter flipping to restore the old, barely functional status quo.\n\nBut such horse-trading scenarios posit a level of traditional calculation and political sapience that just doesn't apply to the Trumpified GOP. To grasp just how far gone the caucus is, just recall the endgame of McCarthy's own fight for leadership survival, which seemed to rely on the charity of the tirelessly demonized Democratic opposition. \"The Democrats had lots of reasons to decide they weren't going to support McCarthy,\" says Geoffrey Kabaservice, vice president of political studies at the Niskanen Center. \"Yet McCarthy still expected them to bail him out. A lot of moderate Republicans were also upset at the Democrats for letting this happen, on the assumption they had to be the adults in the room. But what was McCarthy prepared to actually do for the Democrats? The answer was nothing. Not a single member of the Republican Party understands that this was never going to happen. It's one thing not to understand governing-this suggests that they don't understand politics . That's true from the top to the bottom of the caucus.\"\n\nThis failure bespeaks a broader fealty to an ideology that's short-circuited many of the traditional incentives for political advancement, Kabaservice adds. \"Formerly, people in leadership understood that to have that job, you had to govern. That meant funding the government even if you may not like that fact. But we're in a situation now, where we have this narrowly divided Congress, and these people on the hard right who have always been at the fringes, they now in what you might call the empowered fringes, and they have no incentive to govern. Defying the leadership is their source of money, fame, and power. There's just no way to be an anti-government Republican and govern.\"\n\nThis is how you get to the terrifying prospect of a smash-it-all election denier like Jordan seriously vying for the speakership-prospectively putting him in a position to shut down House dissent should an outvoted Donald Trump again mount a coup effort in January 2025. One small but telling indication of the caucus's disarray is that Nancy Mace, a South Carolina representative who had previously soaked up airtime in the mainstream press on the basis of nonexistent bona fides as a moderate, sided with Gaetz to topple McCarthy and then announced that she was backing Jordan .\n\nJordan has also voted against past security outlays for Ukraine , and is playing up the need to focus instead on the alleged scourge of crime and wrongdoing from the country's southern border as part of his speakership. (Needless to say, he's Trump's choice for the job .) But here, too, Kabaservice says, the political incentives in the GOP are completely out of whack. \"If House Republicans have said all along they care about the outcome in Ukraine, and they let the funding drop, those people have effectively announced their suicide as politicians. If Ukraine goes under, which seems a more and more realistic possibility at this point, they can't just blame it on Joe Biden.... We also don't have an ambassador to Israel right now, because Republicans are playing games for no purpose other than their own aggrandizement and funhouse ideology.\"\n\nThere's also a good chance that Wednesday's vote won't produce a consensus candidate-after all, McCarthy himself endured a 15-vote marathon to get the speakership in January after caving to every conceivable demand of the caucus's hard-right flank, including the motion-to-vacate rule that proved his downfall. That prospect could produce a vote permitting Speaker Pro Tem Patrick McHenry as \"a kind of John Boehner figure,\" Kabaservice says. But of course, Boehner also wound up forfeiting his speakership because the Tea Party right deemed him too prone to making deals to keep things working. It's hard to see any scenario involving a quasi-adult leader of the House Republican caucus that doesn't continue tripping the infinite regress of purist leadership purges from the right. Certainly, the narrow majority the GOP now has doesn't allow for a decisive lurch back toward viable governance. \"Each wing of the party has veto power over the other,\" Kabaservice says. \"For the MAGA wing, if you elect a comparative moderate to speaker, that person is by definition a traitor, and the MAGA wing is gonna get rid of them. On the other hand, the MAGA wing doesn't care anything about declining national security, or the country's continued existence.\"\n\nIt's true, he adds, that \"a lot of Republicans are concerned about this. They'd like to resist, but they're too cowardly.\"\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts.

Activate your online access\n\nTwo weeks after Kevin McCarthy's ouster as speaker of the House, the Ohio representative has failed twice to win enough votes to secure the position.\n\nNo, not Jim Jordan either. A chaos-ridden House Republican caucus tried to pull itself together to elect the shouty, coup-plotting chair of the Judiciary Committee its new speaker on Wednesday, after he came up 20 votes short in the Tuesday balloting. The net result of their efforts was that Jordan got two more \"no\" votes from Republican House members. If he was banking on the second vote to showcase his knack for persuasion, legislative bargaining, and vote counting-all indispensable skills for a House speaker-Jordan can be deemed a complete failure. That verdict was sealed on Thursday, when the House pulled the plug on a third vote that Jordan was clearly destined to lose by a still wider margin. He then threw his support behind granting Pro Tempore Speaker Patrick McHenry of North Carolina powers to move resolutions and legislation forward.\n\nThis was a rare step back from the abyss for House Republicans, given that Jordan is the moral equivalent of a Superfund site. The Ohio congressman not only was in close strategic contact with Trump administration Chief of Staff Mark Meadows in the calamitous countdown to the MAGA insurrection on January 6; he has also defied his subpoena from the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack for over a year. He's also been an obliging outlet for high-conspiratorial Trumpist outrage, from Hunter Biden derangement syndrome to rampant Covid denialism . It's been enough of a mindfuck for the republic, over the past nine months, to endure his conversion of the Judiciary Committee into a running show trial for senior law enforcement officials deemed insufficiently obsequious to the MAGA cause. But putting Jordan in a position to dictate the nation's budgets, policy priorities, and committee assignments-all while being second in line to the presidency-would be an act of extreme nihilism, even for a House majority that's already displayed breathtaking levels of nihilism-tolerance. (This is all to say nothing, by the way, of Jordan's shameful bystander role in the Ohio State wrestling team's sexual abuse scandal while he was the team's assistant coach from 1987 to 1995.)\n\nBut as Wednesday's vote demonstrated, Jordan's sole saving grace is his utter ineffectualness. During his 16-year tenure in the House, he's failed to get a single bill ratified. His behind-the-scenes efforts to flip the detractors in Tuesday's vote his way underlined his trademark bullying-and-berating MO. Jordan supporters anonymously harassed the wife of Nebraska Representative Don Bacon via text and e-mail, threatening his career prospects if he failed to fall in line behind their candidate. (Bacon remained a no in Wednesday's roll call vote, casting his ballot once more for deposed speaker Kevin McCarthy .) Jordan personally distanced himself from these strong-arm tactics and issued a call for unity within the caucus on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. But GOP dissenters properly called out such anemic stabs at damage control for what they were. \"He's lost support because of this,\" one Republican lawmaker told Politico . \"Constant smears-it's just dishonesty at its core.\" Florida GOP Representative Jim Rutherford went on record with the same sentiment: Jordan is \"absolutely responsible for it,\" he told Washington Post reporter Jacqueline Alemany . \"And look, it doesn't work... nobody likes to have their arm twisted.\"\n\nIowa GOP Representative Marinette Miller-Meeks issued a statement late Wednesday reporting that after she'd joined the nays on Jordan's second speakership vote, casting a ballot for Appropriations Chair Kay Granger of Texas when it was clear Jordan wasn't going to win a majority within the caucus, she \"received credible death threats and a barrage of threatening calls,\" which she duly reported to \"the proper authorities.\" A Jordan spokesman denounced the threats , but this was yet another belated effort to downplay an ugly MAGA putsch for power entirely in line with both Jordan's and Donald Trump's vicious and demagogic leadership of the GOP. McCarthy sold his soul to Freedom Caucus obstructionists in his bid to claim the toxic prize of the speakership during January's 15 vote marathon; Jordan made it clear long ago that he has no soul to sell.\n\nIn Wednesday's roll-call vote, Jordan's team sought to paper over its thuggish performance, tapping Oklahoma Representative Tom Cole, who'd led the pro-McCarthy forces in the motion-to-vacate vote two weeks ago, to place Jordan's name into consideration. Cole gamely referred to Jordan's \"integrity\" and even included a reference to his wrestling-coach past, as if to dare detractors to go after him anew. Cole also cited the White House's request for aid to Israel as cause for an expeditious vote to approve Jordan, while hailing the former Freedom Caucus member as a reliable advocate for entitlement-cutting. But Cole's heart clearly wasn't in it-as California Representative Pete Aguilar noted as he nominated minority leader Hakeem Jeffries for the speakership, the Oklahoma lawmaker failed even to mention the status of funding for the Ukraine war effort. Jordan, a longtime skeptic of such funding, had reportedly agreed to permit a separate floor vote on the outlay, which was left on the cutting-room floor as part of McCarthy's fateful continuing resolution deal to avert a government shutdown.\n\nOh, right: The government is rapidly careening toward the next deadline for a budget deal in mid-November, and it's far from clear at the moment who might have the authority to reach another such accord. (McCarthy, in his desperation to keep his job, sought to blame Democrats for the raging dysfunction of his caucus in September's budget negotiations, which proved to be no small factor in his implosion-it's a safe bet that a GOP caucus unable to identify a viable McCarthy successor won't be able to float that outlandish alibi again.)\n\nThe collapse of the last-ditch Jordan campaign puts House Republicans on a streamlined course to bestow new authority on McHenry. This would be an unprecedented move, and it still will involve no small amount of persuasion directed at McHenry, who has stayed mum on the question as he's pushed to get new speaker votes lined up. The McHenry option also would likely have to command support among House Democrats, who could end up supplying the decisive margin if the GOP caucus remains deadlocked. In this scenario, the absurdist spectacle of GOP House rule will have come full circle, since it was collaboration with Democratic lawmakers that was McCarthy's unforgivable sin for GOP hard-liners like Matt Gaetz. Still, McHenry does have one undeniable qualification to lead the House Republican Party: He's been bitten by a rabid fox and lived to tell the tale.\n\nUpdate: In a further stirring display of his utter unsuitability to return Congress to anything like regular order, Jordan reversed himself late Thursday and said he would schedule a third vote on his speakership, after all. Presumably his backers have put in a mass order for brass knuckles on Amazon Prime.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

A key witness promoted as a conscience-ridden whistleblower in the IRS's handling of Hunter Biden's delinquent tax payments was charged with serving as an illicit foreign agent spying for China, and trafficking in arms. And just as the legislative MAGA-verse's Inspector Javert set was poised to depict the IRS as the scheming Beltway left's blunt instrument of choice, former Trump chief of staff John Kelly reported in sworn testimony that the former president himself was keen to \"weaponize\" the IRS-the preferred term of art among the Trumpian faithful-in order to harass and punish FBI agents and others investigating Russia's role in the 2016 presidential campaign. It's become a cliché to note that the delirious accusations of the paranoia-prone right are often acts of pure psychological projection, underlining the ugly tactics and measures they deploy on their opponents, but even by the standards of cliché, this one was way too on the nose. So it's fair to say that House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan, arguably the most ardent of the House Javerts, was feeling some pressure to deliver fresh outrage fodder on Wednesday morning as he summoned FBI Director Christopher Wray to testify about the federal agency's alleged war on right-wing America. Predictably, Jordan's opening statement was a litany of rudderless grievances-less an agenda for reasoned inquiry than a lengthy excerpt from Reddit's r/the_donald discussion board. He began by citing the recent opinion by US District Judge Terence Doughty (a Trump appointee) barring government officials from contacting employees of social media platforms and alleging (in bald ideological caricature) rampant politicized coercion of online speech. He cited the FBI's (successful) search of Trump's Mar-a-Lago compound for purloined classified documents and Attorney General Merrick Garland's alleged designation of activist parents as prospective terrorists (something that never actually happened ). For good measure, he threw in some references to the damning language of never-executed memos urging agents to be on the alert for \"radical Catholic traditionalists.\" This was all nonsense-particularly since the agency now accused of raging anti-conservative persecution has never once in its 115-year history operated under a Democratic director. But it served its chief purpose of rousing the conservative movement faithful to vigilant anti-government alert. Jordan also seamlessly delivered a pet talking point among right-wing grievance merchants-that the FBI is undergoing an existential crisis in public confidence-as he blithely did all he could to hammer away at whatever may remain of such confidence from his chairman's perch.

The committee's grilling of Wray wasn't just inspired by Internet narratives of deep-state persecution of ardent patriots-it was, in essence, the Internet come to life as a legislative probe. T hat's why Jordan and the other MAGA committee members scarcely bothered to answer the heated objections of committee members on the far side of the aisle: They came bearing freshly weaponized data of their own. Kentucky GOP Representative Thomas Massie produced some CCTV footage of a person informing police of the discovery of a pipe bomb outside the Democratic National Committee on January 6-an incident that looked so streamlined and efficient that Massie insinuated federal agents may have planted the offending explosive device themselves. (What this grassy-knoll theorem might mean for the discovery of the other pipe bomb outside the Capitol that day is one of many recondite mysteries here left unplumbed.) Wray replied that the FBI had actually reviewed more than 40,000 videos related to January 6, including that one, and interviewed thousands of participants in the insurrection-at which point, a woman in the audience yelled out \"Shame on you!\" and stormed out of the room, muttering in exasperation, \"He's not going to jail!\" Current Issue View our current issue Again: Internet discourse as civic interrogation. Another prime example came, naturally, from Florida Representative Matt Gaetz, who exultantly quoted an alleged text from Hunter Biden that luridly detailed in the younger Biden's expectation of a $10 million payoff from Chinese business associates while then-former vice president Joe Biden was sitting nearby as a de facto mob enforcer. Joe Biden has denied being on hand during the text's composition, while Hunter Biden's attorney has denounced it as a fake . No matter: \"That sounds like a shakedown, doesn't it, director?\" Gaetz thundered, and then thundered further: \"Are you protecting the Bidens?\" Nadler may have compared the hearing to performance art, but in truth that was an insult to performance artists: The general run of GOP questioning was much closer in spirit and tenor to a Punch and Judy show. Throughout the battery of heavy-breathing insinuations, Wray played the part of a stolid civil servant-the long-suffering puppet-show bobby-absorbing his pummelings from the designated players as part of the job. The click-bait theater here was particularly regrettable since there is an important bit of actual legislative business before Congress when it comes to better oversight of federal law enforcement: the vote to reauthorize Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which governs data collection on US citizens as part of broad sweeps of information ostensibly tracking international terrorism. It's a much-abused provision-particularly on the part of the FBI, as Wray conceded from the witness table-and attempts to curb FISA abuses are one of the only potential areas of bipartisan collaboration on Jordan's committee. But the FISA questioning was again shoehorned clumsily into the MAGA-approved talking points about deep-state perfidy, rendering lucid policy discussion a dead letter here, on grounds of general red-meat deficiency. There was even less appetite, of course, for a line of inquiry that California Democratic Representative Zoe Lofgren debuted, pointing out that the FBI and Justice Department had actually been quite dilatory in their belated probes of Trump's conduct in the Mar-a-Lago documents case and the January 6 coup attempt. Yet these are precisely the sort of questions that need to be widely aired and decisively answered if the debate over the all-too-copious abuses of power by federal law enforcement agencies is ever to be rescued from its present MAGA death spiral. A deep state that only possesses the motivations and ideological affinities of a designated opposition group is an obviously pasteboard creation, to be rolled out as a fresh dramaturgical backdrop on demand. A pair of vignettes from the Wednesday hearing made this all too clear. As Wray strode to the witness table for his swearing-in, a spectator bitterly called out, at Gaetzean volume, \"Will you stop violating our First, Fourth, and Fifth amendments?\" During a recess in the hearing, the same man walked up to a Capitol Police officer and asked him whether the force ever deputized civilians. One moment, in other words, you can be the confrontational scourge of deep-state autocrats; at the next, you can put yourself forward as a potential federal cop.

Jordan also seamlessly delivered a pet talking point among right-wing grievance merchants-that the FBI is undergoing an existential crisis in public confidence-as he blithely did all he could to hammer away at whatever may remain of such confidence from his chairman's perch.

The committee's grilling of Wray wasn't just inspired by Internet narratives of deep-state persecution of ardent patriots-it was, in essence, the Internet come to life as a legislative probe.

Kentucky GOP Representative Thomas Massie produced some CCTV footage of a person informing police of the discovery of a pipe bomb outside the Democratic National Committee on January 6-an incident that looked so streamlined and efficient that Massie insinuated federal agents may have planted the offending explosive device themselves. (What this grassy-knoll theorem might mean for the discovery of the other pipe bomb outside the Capitol that day is one of many recondite mysteries here left unplumbed.) Wray replied that the FBI had actually reviewed more than 40,000 videos related to January 6, including that one, and interviewed thousands of participants in the insurrection-at which point, a woman in the audience yelled out \"Shame on you!\" and stormed out of the room, muttering in exasperation, \"He's not going to jail!\" Current Issue View our current issue Again: Internet discourse as civic interrogation.

Joe Biden has denied being on hand during the text's composition, while Hunter Biden's attorney has denounced it as a fake . No matter: \"That sounds like a shakedown, doesn't it, director?\" Gaetz thundered, and then thundered further: \"Are you protecting the Bidens?\" Nadler may have compared the hearing to performance art, but in truth that was an insult to performance artists: The general run of GOP questioning was much closer in spirit and tenor to a Punch and Judy show. Throughout the battery of heavy-breathing insinuations, Wray played the part of a stolid civil servant-the long-suffering puppet-show bobby-absorbing his pummelings from the designated players as part of the job. The click-bait theater here was particularly regrettable since there is an important bit of actual legislative business before Congress when it comes to better oversight of federal law enforcement: the vote to reauthorize Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which governs data collection on US citizens as part of broad sweeps of information ostensibly tracking international terrorism. It's a much-abused provision-particularly on the part of the FBI, as Wray conceded from the witness table-and attempts to curb FISA abuses are one of the only potential areas of bipartisan collaboration on Jordan's committee. But the FISA questioning was again shoehorned clumsily into the MAGA-approved talking points about deep-state perfidy, rendering lucid policy discussion a dead letter here, on grounds of general red-meat deficiency. There was even less appetite, of course, for a line of inquiry that California Democratic Representative Zoe Lofgren debuted, pointing out that the FBI and Justice Department had actually been quite dilatory in their belated probes of Trump's conduct in the Mar-a-Lago documents case and the January 6 coup attempt. Yet these are precisely the sort of questions that need to be widely aired and decisively answered if the debate over the all-too-copious abuses of power by federal law enforcement agencies is ever to be rescued from its present MAGA death spiral.

Brace yourselves.\n\nFormer president Donald Trump welcomes Representative Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) to the stage at a rally in support of Ohio Senate candidate J.D. Vance in Vandalia, Ohio, on November 7, 2022.\n\nSuffice it to say that if Liz Cheney had survived the wrath of Donald Trump and retained her congressional seat, she would be organizing congressional Republicans to oppose Jim Jordan's bid to become speaker of the House.\n\nBut Cheney, the bluntest Republican critic of Trump's assault on democracy, was crushed in the 2022 primary campaign for her Wyoming seat, thus foreclosing any chance that she would ever achieve the speakership that she so obviously coveted. But Cheney is still battling Trump and still, in her way, battling for the speakership.\n\nEven before Trump endorsed Jordan's candidacy to replace deposed speaker Kevin McCarthy early on Friday morning, Cheney was raising a red alert regarding the House Judiciary Committee chair's bid to become the most powerful Republican in Washington.\n\nWere House Republicans to opt for Jordan in the race he is now running against House majority leader Steve Scalise (R-La.), Cheney argued in an October 4 speech at the University of Minnesota, it would be an ominous development for her party and her country. \"If they were to decide that Jim Jordan should be the Speaker of the House,\" she warned , \"there would no longer be any possible way to argue that a group of elected Republicans could be counted on to defend the Constitution.\"\n\nIn reality, the notion that elected Republicans are inclined as a group to defend the Constitution went out the window long ago. Cheney was a part of the problem when she chaired the House Republican Conference and served as one of the most hawkish members of a chamber that regularly rejected its constitutional duty to check and balance presidential war-making and abuses of civil liberties. Cheney actually voted with Trump on a slightly more frequent basis than Jordan -though, it should be noted, on a slightly less frequent basis than Scalise , an insider whose social conservative streak comes with a pro-corporate edge.\n\nCheney's concerns about Jordan are rooted in the bitter experiences of her final term in the House, when she and a handful of other Republicans tried to hold the former president to account for his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden. Both Jordan and Scalise were on the wrong side of that fight, but Cheney, the former cochair of the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol, argues , \"Jim Jordan knew more about what Donald Trump had planned for January 6th than any other member of the House of Representatives. Jim Jordan was involved, was part of the conspiracy in which Donald Trump was engaged as he attempted to overturn the election.\"\n\nJordan was so involved that he reportedly discussed the prospect of Trump issuing preemptory pardons to the former president's congressional allies. And Jordan was among Trump's most ardent defenders during his second impeachment in 2021.\n\nThat gives Cheney plenty of reasons to oppose Jordan-and Trump just as many reasons to support him. So it comes as no surprise that, within hours of Cheney's warning, Trump rejected overtures from House allies who wanted him to seek the speakership and endorsed Jordan's bid.\n\n\"He will be a GREAT Speaker of the House,\" declared Trump , who added, \"He is STRONG on Crime, Borders, our Military/Vets, & 2nd Amendment.\"\n\nThe choice between Scalise and Jordan is not an ideological one, and there's an argument to be made that Scalise would be more effective at pulling the caucus together and advancing the conservative agenda. But Trump's not interested. In the former president's eyes, Jordan's biggest selling point is that he is stronger on Trump than any top Republican in the House. Jordan proved that when he abused his authority as Judiciary Committee chair so egregiously that attorneys for Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg alleged that he had engaged in \"a campaign of intimidation, retaliation and obstruction\" in order to undermine efforts to prosecute Trump-who currently faces 91 criminal indictments, in a number of jurisdictions.\n\nAnd, of course, Jordan has been leading the effort to impeach Trump's likely opponent in the 2024 presidential race, President Biden, on charges so spurious that constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley, a frequent GOP witness on issues related to presidential accountability, told the House Oversight Committee that he did \"not believe that the current evidence would support articles of impeachment.\"\n\nIf Jordan becomes speaker, it's a safe bet that the impeachment inquiry will proceed more aggressively than it did under McCarthy- who faced criticism from conservatives for his hesitancy regarding the initiative. Even if Jordan could get the House to vote to impeach Biden-which is not guaranteed-the prospects for a conviction in the Democratic Senate would be slim.\n\nElie Mystal\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nJeet Heer\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nBut it is surely worth noting that, as speaker of the House, Jordan would not merely be the most powerful Republican in the Capitol. He would be second in the line of presidential succession after Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nA daunting thought for those who recall that former House speaker John Boehner, who once dismissed his fellow Ohio Republican as a \"political terrorist,\" has said of Jordan , \"I just never saw a guy who spent more time tearing things apart-never building anything, never putting anything together.\"\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

(Photo by Spencer Platt / Getty Images)\n\nWhen Thomas Dewey, arguably the most nationally prominent Manhattan district attorney before Alvin Bragg, was running for the post in 1937, he made it clear that he was prepared to go after political wrongdoers. A young special prosecutor who had made a name for himself taking on gangsters, Dewey announced his candidacy on the Republican Party line because, he said, he believed it was necessary to go after Tammany Hall , the Democratic political machine that once dominated the politics of New York City. He said, \"[I]t has become clear to me that there is an alliance between crime and certain elements of Tammany Hall. For twenty years Tammany Hall has controlled criminal prosecutions and for twenty years the power of the criminal underworld has grown. This alliance must be broken.\" Dewey got plenty of blowback from Democratic politicians, who charged that he planned to politicize the DA's office. US Representative Martin Kennedy, a Tammany defender, attacked Dewey as \" cowardly and contemptible \" and suggested that the Republican was prepared to waste taxpayer dollars on \"investigating everything from City Hall to the White House.\" Yet, come November, the overwhelmingly Democratic borough of Manhattan (New York County) elected Dewey by a landslide. The Tammany crowd continued to attack the new DA, as he kept his promises to follow the facts wherever they led him. But it didn't do Dewey any harm; he was eventually elected as governor of New York and twice nominated as his party's candidate for the presidency. Fast-forward 86 years, and another Manhattan DA is under fierce assault for supposedly wasting resources on \" a political persecution \" that his critics claim has distracted one of the nation's leading law enforcement offices. On Monday, House Judiciary Committee chair Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) swept into New York City to conduct a hearing that attacked District Attorney Bragg, whose office has secured indictments against Jordan's political ally, former president Donald Trump, on 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree. During the course of a bombastic hearing that peddled the line that Manhattan's first Black district attorney was soft on crime and overly tough on Trump, Jordan claimed that the DA's office had \"lost its way when it comes to fighting crime and upholding the law.\" \"Here in Manhattan, the scales of justice are weighed down by politics,\" Jordan raged . \"For the district attorney justice isn't blind-it's about advancing opportunities to promote a political agenda-a radical political agenda.\" More From John Nichols The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" April 25, 2025 The Pope Who Decried the Savage Inequalities of Billionaire-Class Capitalism April 21, 2025 A Pope Who Prays for Palestine April 20, 2025 Just as the critics of Thomas Dewey failed to gain traction in the New York City of the 1930s, however, Jordan's line of attack bogged down in the New York City of the 2020s. Mayor Eric Adams, a former police captain, rebuked the Judiciary Committee chair on the day of the hearing, saying , \"It is really troubling that American taxpayers' dollars are being used to come here on this junket to do an examination of the safest big city in America instead of focusing on the real over-proliferation of guns that we have witnessed.\" Representative Dan Goldman, a Manhattan Democrat, dismissed the hearing as a \" charade .\" And Former House Judiciary Committee chair Jerry Nadler, also a Manhattan Democrat, announced in his opening statement to the hearing, \"Let me be very clear: We are here today in Lower Manhattan for one reason and one reason only-the chairman is doing the bidding of Donald Trump.\" Crowds of New Yorkers gathered outside the session to protest against Jordan's stunt, with many of them demanding that the chairman \"let the public in\" to the hearing that featured testimony from a handful of New Yorkers but failed to invite the mayor or other local officials. Bragg pushed back just as loudly. The DA sued Jordan for interfering with the effort to prosecute Trump by launching \"an unprecedentedly brazen and unconstitutional attack\" on the prosecutor's office. Countering Jordan's over-the-top claims about crime in the city, the DA's office pointed to fresh New York Police Department data that shows murders in Manhattan are down 14 percent from a year ago, while shootings are down 17 percent, burglaries are down 21 percent, and robberies are down 18 percent. The office also observed, \"In D.A. Bragg's first year in office, New York City had one of the lowest murder rates of major cities in the United States (5.2)-nearly three times lower than Columbus, Ohio (15.4),\" referring to Jordan's home state. \"If the chairman truly cared about public safety, he could take a short drive to Columbus, Dayton, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Akron or Toledo...rather than using taxpayer dollars to travel hundreds of miles out of his way.\" There's plenty of honest debate in legal and political circles about whether the Manhattan DA's office should be taking the lead in holding Trump to account, and about whether so sweeping an indictment for corporate crime violations is the right approach. But there is little doubt that Bragg's decision to go ahead with the prosecution has unsettled Trump's most ardent defenders, including Jordan and the right-wing pundits who were cheering him on Monday. They have made Bragg, a former chief deputy attorney general of New York and assistant United States Attorney in the Southern District of New York, the target of vitriolic attacks that may play well in red states but aren't likely to do the DA much damage in Manhattan. Bragg was nominated with relative ease in 2021 over a crowded field of Democratic primary contenders for the powerful district attorney post, and then won in November with almost 84 percent of the vote . He did so as a candidate who made it clear that he was prepared to initiate criminal justice reforms, as did many of his rivals in that 2021 Democratic field. And he made it equally clear that, if the facts made a case for prosecuting Trump, he would pursue that case. There was no mystery with regard to the course Bragg intended to chart as district attorney, and since taking office he has done what the voters elected him to do. Jordan imagines that he is doing damage to Bragg by \"exposing\" the DA as a politicized prosecutor, just as the Tammany Hall hacks of the 1930s thought they were exposing and damaging Dewey. There are plenty of differences between Bragg and Dewey, and even more differences between the times in which each man took office. But the notion that a congressman from a rival party is going to convince New Yorkers that there is something wrong with a prosecutor's keeping a campaign promise-especially when it's a promise to hold the politically powerful to account-remains as far-fetched today as it was all those decades ago.\n\nDewey got plenty of blowback from Democratic politicians, who charged that he planned to politicize the DA's office.

Bragg was nominated with relative ease in 2021 over a crowded field of Democratic primary contenders for the powerful district attorney post, and then won in November with almost 84 percent of the vote . He did so as a candidate who made it clear that he was prepared to initiate criminal justice reforms, as did many of his rivals in that 2021 Democratic field. And he made it equally clear that, if the facts made a case for prosecuting Trump, he would pursue that case. There was no mystery with regard to the course Bragg intended to chart as district attorney, and since taking office he has done what the voters elected him to do. Jordan imagines that he is doing damage to Bragg by \"exposing\" the DA as a politicized prosecutor, just as the Tammany Hall hacks of the 1930s thought they were exposing and damaging Dewey. There are plenty of differences between Bragg and Dewey, and even more differences between the times in which each man took office. But the notion that a congressman from a rival party is going to convince New Yorkers that there is something wrong with a prosecutor's keeping a campaign promise-especially when it's a promise to hold the politically powerful to account-remains as far-fetched today as it was all those decades ago.\n\nBragg pushed back just as loudly. The DA sued Jordan for interfering with the effort to prosecute Trump by launching \"an unprecedentedly brazen and unconstitutional attack\" on the prosecutor's office. Countering Jordan's over-the-top claims about crime in the city, the DA's office pointed to fresh New York Police Department data that shows murders in Manhattan are down 14 percent from a year ago, while shootings are down 17 percent, burglaries are down 21 percent, and robberies are down 18 percent. The office also observed, \"In D.A. Bragg's first year in office, New York City had one of the lowest murder rates of major cities in the United States (5.2)-nearly three times lower than Columbus, Ohio (15.4),\" referring to Jordan's home state. \"If the chairman truly cared about public safety, he could take a short drive to Columbus, Dayton, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Akron or Toledo...rather than using taxpayer dollars to travel hundreds of miles out of his way.\" There's plenty of honest debate in legal and political circles about whether the Manhattan DA's office should be taking the lead in holding Trump to account, and about whether so sweeping an indictment for corporate crime violations is the right approach.

Jordan later pressed Garland on why US Attorneys had allowed the statute of limitations to lapse on presidential failson Hunter Biden's IRS charges by thundering, \"Everybody knows why they did it!\" (He, of course, failed to note that the misdemeanor charges resulted in Biden's repayment of delinquent taxes.) Moving on to the tirelessly flogged question of whether Hunter's father, serving as vice president, stepped in to secure the dismissal of the Ukrainian special prosecutor allegedly charged with investigating Burisma, the oil giant where Hunter enjoyed a generous board sinecure, Jordan announced, \"Eyewitnesses we talked to said that this was slow-walked, and we know why.\" Florida Representative Matt Gaetz, taking a break from threatening Kevin McCarthy's speakership and provoking an all-but-certain government shutdown, reeled off a series of speculative scenarios in which purchasers of Hunter Biden's artwork were \"currying favor\" with the Biden White House in a network of shifty deals that somehow involved the Chinese Communist Party. At one point, Gaetz pronounced, \"I already know that answer, and so does everyone.\" As the proceedings wore on into their fourth hour, Arizona Representative and Freedom Caucus Chairman Andy Biggs brushed off a Garland reply to a question about the January 6 prosecution by saying, \"Well, la-di-da.\"\n\nLa-di-da indeed. The Garland spectacle stood out in stark and absurdist relief this week, as the hard-right faction of the House Republican caucus has trashed a series of negotiations and deals that would fend off a government shutdown at the end of the month. In the absence of consensus on the most basic duty of the House, Republicans were eager to showcase their preferred use of government resources: to hammer away at the perception that Garland, the sort of deferential institutionalist that the term \"milquetoast\" was coined to describe, is an ideologically driven Inspector Javert, dead set on prosecuting former president Donald Trump and covering up the many trespasses of the Bidens.\n\nOver and over again, heavy-breathing committee Republicans homed in on the usual talking points about the Biden crime-family fantasia: the alleged \"sweetheart deal\" engineered for the accused tax evader and gun owner; the alleged decision to let the statute of limitations kick in on the IRS charges; the alleged failures of federal attorneys in districts beyond Delaware, where the initial Hunter Biden probe was launched, to permit special counsel David Weiss, a Trump DOJ appointee, to pursue charges in their jurisdictions. An especially operatic leitmotif was the outraged citation of the term \"extraordinary circumstances\" in Garland's memo announcing Weiss's special counsel appointment. As one interlocutor after another demanded that Garland define just what these clearly suspicious circumstances might be, the attorney general eventually replied that it's boilerplate language drawn from the independent counsel statute.\n\nOne notable exception to the manic determination to bring impeachment charges against President Biden was Colorado Representative Ken Buck, who has lately broken with the GOP caucus on the rush to launch Biden impeachment inquiries based on his son's behavior. \"What's missing, despite years of investigation,\" Buck wrote in a recent Washington Post op-ed , \"is the smoking gun that connects Joe Biden to his ne'er-do-well son's corruption.\"\n\nGarland's questioners kept harping on what \"everybody knows\" in defiance of actual and firmly established knowledge. In a prior hearing before the House oversight committee, for example, Devon Archer, one of the president's son's closest business associates, declared that Joe Biden had no involvement in Hunter's business dealings; instead, Hunter was only trafficking in \" the illusion of access ,\" Archer explained. Just as there are innuendos that \"everybody knows,\" there are truths that everyone ignores. Another such truth that never got aired during the half-day involved the Burisma case: The dismissal of Ukrainian prosecutor Viktor Shokin was not, in fact, payback for targeting Burisma; in fact, Shokin was sidestepping Burisma along with other major potential prosecutions, and then-Vice President Biden was simply carrying out US anti-corruption policy in seeking to secure Shokin's dismissal. Other pet GOP urban legends were repeated for maximum grievance effect, such as the bogus claim that the DOJ circulated a memo characterizing conservative parents staging protests at school board meetings as \"domestic terrorists.\" (Even by traditional GOP truth-defiling talking points, this one's a whopper; the offending phrase appeared in a letter to Garland from the National School Boards Association.)\n\nAgain, no matter: The specter of a \"weaponized\" and \"two-tier\" justice system was invoked at every conceivable pass. In their zeal, Garland's right-wing questioners frequently lost the plot. In one of the hearing's most, uh, flamboyant moments, Wisconsin Representative Tom Tiffany started inveighing against an all-nude bike ride hosted in the college town of Madison. After the soliloquy died down, Garland ventured that \"it sounds like you're asking a question of state and local law enforcement.\" That yielded the spittle-flecked reply, \"State and local law enforcement would not act. We were hoping you would; it's obvious you're not.\" After all, if Garland had authored the conspiracy to imprison Trump and let the Biden crime family go free, who's to say that he wouldn't be colluding with cops in America's dairyland to empower gangs of unclad velocipedists?\n\nIn structural terms, Garland's plight before the committee was akin to Kevin McCarthy's doomed quest for a functional deal to keep the government going. In endorsing Weiss's special counsel inquiry, Garland had sought to fend off scorched-earth attacks from the hard-right nihilists in the GOP caucus. McCarthy made the same calculation when he authorized three committee inquiries devoted to a Biden impeachment (including, of course, the one to be convened by Jordan's judiciary panel) in order to smooth the path to a budget deal. Garland further sought to court legitimacy from the Freedom Caucus by greenlighting Hunter Biden's indictment on charges that very rarely yield such indictments. This, too, was a fool's errand; Garland was going to be in the sights of Jordan and his minions no matter what.\n\nAs Buck drily noted, Garland would have been pilloried from the right had he elected after his appointment to take Weiss off the Hunter Biden case-just as he is now being castigated for making Weiss an independent special prosecutor in the same inquiry. As the House sputters off into self-dramatizing squalor, taking many vulnerable Americans down with the prospect of an unfunded government, McCarthy and Garland are now reaping the karmic wages of their own self-delusion. You might even say the fix is in.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

Willis, the Atlanta prosecutor who brought an election interference case against Donald J.

Your so-called 'investigation' into the Office's contacts with the\r\nHouse Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol has\r\nnever been anything more than a dangerous attempt, performed at the behest of those under\r\n1 Letter from Rep. Jim Jordan, Chairman, H. Comm. on the Judiciary, to Ms. Trina Swanson-Lucas, Assistant Chief\r\nInvestigator, Fulton Cty. Dist. Att'y Off. (Feb. 6, 2025); Letter from Rep. Jim Jordan, Chairman, H.

Comm. on the Judiciary (Dec. 12, 2024).\r\n1\n\ninvestigation, to obstruct our Office from our ongoing criminal prosecutions and investigations.3\r\nThe case this office brought was after months of careful deliberation and investigation by my\r\nOffice and by two grand juries empaneled under Georgia law. The federal government has no right\r\nto obstruct state and local investigations and prosecutions because you want to appease defendants\r\nwhom a grand jury has found probable cause to indict by interfering in their ongoing prosecution.\r\nWith regard to the document requests, you have asked FCDA employees to produce documents to\r\nyou that the Office and I have already explained that we cannot disclose because we must avoid\r\nany actions that could potentially compromise an ongoing investigation and prosecution by this\r\noffice. As I wrote to you just a few weeks ago, the communications you are seeking-to the extent\r\nthey exist are directly related to Fulton County's ongoing investigation of several individuals\r\npursuant to Georgia criminal statutes. These individuals were properly investigated and indicted\r\nby a grand jury consistent with Georgia criminal procedure. 4 Prosecution of these charges is\r\nongoing. Your requests also exceed the limits of Congressional authority and violate core\r\nconstitutional principles of separation of powers, state sovereignty, and federalism, as set forth in\r\nmy prior letters.5\r\nAt its core, you seek documents and information revealing how attorneys in my office conducted\r\nan investigation that ultimately led to a grand jury indictment. Any such documents are protected\r\nfrom disclosure by attorney-client privilege, work-product privilege, and other common law\r\nprotections. As I have already noted in a prior letter to you, the \"preservation of the secrecy of\r\ngrand jury proceedings\" is \"a well-recognized principle in Georgia\" as well as in the federal legal\r\nsystem. Moreover, requests for documentation regarding my office's preparation for grand jury\r\nproceedings cut to the core of the deliberative process privilege, which generally protects pre-\r\ndecisional documents generated by government agencies as they seek to advance their missions.\r\n8\r\n3 These efforts to prevent accountability for attempts to overturn the 2020 election have continued.

They believed that installing Mr. Jordan, a hard-right Ohioan and political brawler, would reward colleagues who had played dirty in unseating Speaker Kevin McCarthy and undermining the candidacy of Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana.\n\nIt particularly galled them that Mr. Scalise, the No. 2 Republican, defeated Mr. Jordan, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, in the initial party vote to choose a replacement for Mr. McCarthy only to then watch Mr. Jordan's allies immediately pivot to denying Mr. Scalise the speakership on the floor. The anti-Jordan lawmakers then found themselves under a withering social media attack from the right and confronting violent threats against them and their families for balking at voting for Mr. Jordan.\n\nIt only reinforced the resistance among the Republicans who see themselves as institutionalists. They insist that they just want to legislate in a conservative but orderly fashion and escape the chaos that has rocked Republicans for more than two weeks, damaging their image and their prospects for holding the House in next year's elections.\n\n\"These are the folks who are the ultimate team players,\" said Representative Mario Diaz-Balart, Republican of Florida and an informal ringleader of the rule-follower caucus, about those who joined with him and others to beat back the Jordan candidacy. \"These are the folks that fall on their swords on tough votes.\"\n\nIt wasn't just their tactics that finished off Mr. Jordan, who found himself on the wrong end of a lopsided secret vote that he should drop out. It was Mr. Jordan's ideology and record.

But with scores of Republicans refusing to back him, the party put off a House floor vote until next week.\n\nBy Luke Broadwater\n\nReporting from the Capitol\n\nFollow our live updates for the House speaker vote .\n\nHouse Republicans on Friday nominated Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, the hard-right chairman of the Judiciary Committee, to be their next speaker, but quickly postponed a floor vote to elect him as scores of their members refused to commit to backing him.\n\nBy a vote of 124 to 81, Mr. Jordan defeated Representative Austin Scott of Georgia, a mainstream conservative and an ally of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy who had decided just hours earlier to seek the nomination. Mr. Scott had effectively put himself forward as a protest candidate against Mr. Jordan, the co-founder of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus and a favorite of former President Donald J. Trump's.\n\nBut while Mr. Jordan won the contest, his quest for the speakership still faced serious challenges. A second secret-ballot vote revealed that a sizable chunk of Republicans did not intend to support him on the floor, where he needs 217 votes to win the gavel. It was a continuation of the bitter party infighting that has broken out in recent days, paralyzing the House.\n\nAfter a week of turmoil and disarray, Republicans sent their members home for the weekend late Friday afternoon with no resolution and no sense of when the feuding might end. Mr. Jordan hoped to flip enough members for a vote on the House floor on Tuesday, but with G.O.P. lawmakers seemingly unable to reach consensus, it was not clear whether he could succeed.\n\n\"I think it's a very difficult math equation for him to overcome,\" said Representative Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida. \"He deserves the opportunity to try to see if he can get that math better.

      "text": "Jim Jordan Doesn't Know What Courage Is\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSubscriber-only Newsletter\n\nBy David French\n\nIt's hard to overstate the extent to which our nation's absurd Jim Jordan moment encapsulates the deep dysfunction of the political right in the United States.\n\nThere's of course all the chaos and incompetence of the Trumpist Republican Party, on display for the world to see. An extremist faction of the House deposed their own party's speaker of the House without a successor, and now - in the midst of multiplying international crises - the House is rudderless. In fact, it's worse than rudderless. As I write this newsletter it's in a state of utter confusion.\n\nBut there's also a deeper reality at play here, one that goes well beyond simple incompetence. The Republican base admires Jordan because it thinks he is tough. It perceives him as a man of courage and strength. He is not. Instead, he is a symbol of the way in which Trumpist Republicans have corrupted the concept of courage itself.\n\nTo understand what courage is supposed to be, I turn to a definition from C.S. Lewis: \"Courage is not simply one of the virtues but the form of every virtue at the testing point, which means, at the point of highest reality.\" It's a beautiful formulation, one that encompasses both the moral and physical realms and declares that courage is inseparable from virtue.\n\nLewis's definition presents us with the sobering realization that we don't truly know if we possess a virtue unless and until it is tested. We can believe we're honest, but we won't know we're truly honest unless we have the courage to tell the truth when the truth will cost us something we value. We can believe we're brave, but we don't know if we are until we show it when we face a genuine physical risk.\n\nWhen I meet a virtuous person, I also know that I'm meeting a person of real courage. A lifetime of virtue is impossible absent courage. Conversely, when I see a person consumed with vice, I also know that I'm likely in the presence of a coward, a person whose commitments to virtue could not survive the tests of life.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

On Tuesday the House Republican gong show once again failed to choose a new speaker of the House.\n\nThis time it was one of the conference's most belligerent hard-liners, Jim Jordan, who got smacked down, falling a whopping 17 votes short of a majority on the first round of voting. Things got worse on Wednesday when he lost even more support in a second round of voting, and there was no sign he would do any better in any further rounds. Fingers crossed. Mr. Jordan's failure to seize the gavel would be a good thing for all Americans - most definitely including responsible Republican lawmakers.\n\nHis belly flop set off a flurry of anxious speculation about What Next. Will he cut the mother of all deals with enough G.O.P. holdouts to drag himself over the finish line? Will a dark-horse alternative candidate emerge? Will Kevin McCarthy rise from the dead like some congressional Nosferatu? Will the winsomely bow-tied Patrick McHenry serve as speaker pro tem forever? \"I don't know what to think,\" lamented James Comer, a Jordan backer, as he fled the floor on Tuesday.\n\nEventually, one assumes, a new speaker will emerge.

Our system of federalism and dual sovereignty between state and national government allows for laboratories of autocracy as much as testing grounds for democracy. Our counter-majoritarian institutions and supermajority rules stymie democratic majorities and turn stability into stasis, putting terrible stress on our entire political system.\n\nBut it's hard to deal with any of those, or even just live with them, when one of our two major parties is on a downward spiral of dysfunction, with each version of itself more chaotic and deviant than the last.\n\nFor years, it has been evident that the Republican Party can't govern. When Donald Trump was in office, it was revealing to see the extent to which Republican majorities in Congress struggled to write and pass any legislation of consequence. To wit, after an unsuccessful herculean lift trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act and a successful effort to cut taxes (the lowest hanging fruit on the conservative menu), congressional Republicans essentially stopped legislating until they were dislodged from control of the House in the 2018 midterms.\n\nWhat's become clear of late, in the midst of the chaos that has left the House without a speaker at a particularly fraught moment in foreign and domestic affairs, is that Republicans are as unable to organize themselves as they are incapable of leading the affairs of state.\n\nThe worst of the problem of the Republican Party, however, is evident in the rise of Jim Jordan and the ascendance of the insurrection wing of the party, with only modest opposition from supposedly more reasonable Republican lawmakers.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

It was an uphill fight for a man once branded a \"legislative terrorist\" by a speaker of his own party, and one to which he was not particularly well suited after 16 years in Congress in which he has not sponsored a single bill that has become law.\n\nThe dilemma encapsulated the turmoil inside the House G.O.P. two weeks after Representative Kevin McCarthy was ousted from the speakership by a band of far-right rebels who were livid about his compromises with Democrats to head off a catastrophic federal debt default in the spring and a government shutdown this month. Now House Republicans find themselves unable to coalesce around Mr. Jordan, the uncompromising nominee to replace him. Mainstream lawmakers - usually the ones trying to cut deals and reach consensus - have refused to countenance the prospect of Mr. Jordan ascending to the job second in line to the presidency.\n\nSome remain upset at the way Mr. McCarthy was removed. Others are angry that many Republicans abandoned Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the party's No. 2 in the House as its majority leader, after he initially defeated Mr. Jordan in an internal vote for the speaker nomination. Some just don't want Mr. Jordan and view him as a threat to their re-elections and a functioning government.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Republicans had nominated Mr. Scalise as Mr. McCarthy's successor, but he dropped out after he could not consolidate enough support to win the post on the floor.\n\nHere's a look at the lawmakers who opposed Mr. Jordan on the first vote.\n\nThere are 18 Republicans in the House who represent districts Mr. Biden won in the last presidential election. Six of them voted for candidates other than Mr. Jordan:\n\nDon Bacon of Nebraska\n\nLori Chavez DeRemer of Oregon\n\nAnthony D'Esposito of New York\n\nJen Kiggans of Virginia\n\nNick LaLota of New York\n\nMike Lawler of New York\n\nA group of seven Republicans who serve on the Appropriations Committee, which controls federal spending, expressed concern about Mr. Jordan's anti-spending past. Some of them feared that he would demand across-the-board funding cuts, including to the military.\n\nMario Diaz-Balart of Florida\n\nJake Ellzey of Texas\n\nTony Gonzales of Texas\n\nKay Granger of Texas, the chairwoman of the appropriations panel.\n\nJohn Rutherford of Florida\n\nMike Simpson of Idaho\n\nSteve Womack of Arkansas\n\nMr. Womack said he voted against Mr. Jordan on principle because Mr. Scalise was \"kneecapped before he could win over his opponents.\"\n\nDoug LaMalfa of California\n\nThe northern Californian said he would vote for Mr. Jordan on the second ballot.\n\nJohn James of Michigan\n\nAndrew Garbarino of New York\n\nCarlos Gimenez of Florida\n\nMike Kelly of Pennsylvania\n\nVictoria Spartz of Indiana\n\nKen Buck of Colorado - Mr. Buck said there were a number of reasons he did not back Mr. Jordan, but his main sticking point was the fact that Mr. Jordan played a lead role in the attempt to overturn President Biden's victory in the 2020 election on the floor of the House. \"I don't want someone who was involved in the activities of January 6,\" he told CNN after the vote.\n\nAnnie Karni is a congressional correspondent.

      "text": "Jim Jordan's Conspiratorial Quest for Power\n\nOn October 3rd, Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives were threatening to do something unprecedented in American history. A faction of the far right had introduced a motion to oust their leader, Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Before the final vote, McCarthy's allies offered some words in his defense. The third member to rise to the dais was Jim Jordan, a fifty-nine-year-old Republican from Ohio, who for years has been the Party's most influential insurgent. Colleagues used to call him \"the other Speaker of the House,\" because of his frequent maneuvers against leadership. But this time his tone was subdued. He was there to praise McCarthy, not to bury him.\n\n\"Kevin McCarthy has been rock solid,\" Jordan began. He wore a dark suit jacket, which looked almost exotic on his shoulders. When he holds forth-as he routinely does in the House committee room and on conservative television-he's almost always in shirtsleeves, speaking in a rapid-fire diction that can make him sound like an auctioneer crossed with a street preacher. Listeners who share his grievances are inspired; those who don't often have little idea what he's talking about. In his seventeen-year career in Congress, Jordan has not once sponsored a bill that became law. Instead, he's searched for victims of liberal plots-the most famous being Donald Trump, whose election loss, in 2020, Jordan refused to certify.\n\nNow Jordan recited the accomplishments of the previous nine months in the Republican House, ticking off a list of investigative probes into far-right causes célèbres which, he said, had revealed bias against conservatives at the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security, machinations by the deep state, malfeasance related to the 2020 Presidential election. These achievements, he went on, \"happened under Speaker McCarthy.\" But none of it would have happened without Jordan, who is currently the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. In paying tribute to McCarthy, Jordan was also dusting off his own résumé. The next morning, after eight Republicans, joined by every House Democrat, voted to remove McCarthy, Jordan declared that he was running for Speaker himself.\n\nStraightaway, he had some two hundred backers. That he was in the running at all marked a seismic shift, both in Congress and in the Republican Party. The Speaker isn't just the second in line for the Presidency; he sets the chamber's entire legislative agenda. By his own admission, Jordan \"didn't come to Washington to make more laws.\" He had risen in stature as a political hit man, a launcher of partisan inquisitions. In a conference of cynics, he had distinguished himself as a true believer. No one was more aggressive in prosecuting the Party's paranoia or more creative in stoking its sense of victimhood. The villains in the schemes he rode to power could come from anywhere.\n\nOne of them was Kate Starbird, a computer scientist at the University of Washington. Starbird has what she calls a \"sticky\" name-it stays in people's heads. She also has an unlikely background: for nine years, she played professional basketball, including five seasons in the W.N.B.A. After retiring, at the age of thirty, she completed a Ph.D. program, with a focus on a burgeoning field called crisis informatics-the study of how people use (and misuse) social media during natural disasters, wars, terrorist attacks, and other outbreaks of violence. Often, her academic work involves analyzing online conspiracy theories: how and why they spread and who keeps them going. In her professional judgment, in the summer of 2022 she became the target of a very good one.\n\nThe origin was, in part, a single line taken out of context. It came from a report released in March, 2021, by the Election Integrity Partnership, a group of academics, students, and data analysts that tracked online misinformation during the 2020 election. Through an organization that received funding from the Department of Homeland Security, they were able to communicate with local and state election officials, sharing information and looking into tips. Kim Wyman, the former Republican secretary of state of Washington, told me that, in the past, \"election officials saw posts that were wrong, but couldn't take them down.\" Now they could consult directly with a team of researchers, and send inaccurate information-misreported voting hours at a polling place, for instance-to the relevant social-media platforms, which would decide whether to remove it.\n\nStarbird had joined the project, in the summer of 2020, with colleagues from the University of Washington's Center for an Informed Public and the Stanford Internet Observatory, where the concept had originated. Several months after the election, the researchers published their final report. On page 183, they cited a critical part of their data set: 21,897,364 tweets, collected between August 15 and December 12, 2020, which dealt with false information or unsubstantiated rumors. Some three thousand tweets were flagged as potential violations of Twitter's terms of use.\n\n\"My wife thinks I'm losing touch with reality when I try to explain the whole story,\" Starbird told me recently. By the time of the report, Trump's lies about a stolen election were starting to cool in the mainstream of the Republican Party. His lawyers and their allies had lost repeatedly in court; the Department of Justice was making arrests for the insurrection at the Capitol on January 6th. Starbird observed the fallout in the far corners of the Internet, where increasingly wild theories would surface-January 6th was an Antifa plot or an F.B.I. setup-then wash out. One recurring idea, Starbird said, was \"that there was censorship that hid the truth of what happened in 2020, that this was the real reason Trump lost.\"\n\nAt some point-it was impossible to say exactly when-online conspiracists began claiming that Starbird and other researchers at the Election Integrity Partnership had colluded with the Department of Homeland Security to censor twenty-two million tweets during the 2020 election. This was, Starbird told me, \"a literal misreading\" of the group's findings. But the conspiracy theory had all the key elements to spread widely, starting with the fact that it was politically useful. \"People wanted to believe it,\" she said.\n\nAllegations began to appear on fringe news outlets, such as the Gateway Pundit. On August 27, 2022, Mike Benz, an ex-Trump appointee who runs an organization called the Foundation for Freedom Online, wrote that his exposé of D.H.S. would provide \"the basis for a full-scale bipartisan Congressional committee armed with subpoena power.\" The story soon reached Breitbart and Steve Bannon's podcast. On Twitter, Trump supporters told Starbird to lawyer up.\n\nIn September, the University of Washington started to get dozens of public-records requests seeking access to Starbird's and her colleagues' work e-mails. These came from more established sources: the Republican attorney general of Missouri, Eric Schmitt (who is now a U.S. senator); a journalist from the Intercept; the conservative foundation Judicial Watch. Since the university is public, the administration was legally obligated to supply the e-mails. \"In reality, all these records would be a great defense if a real person were to go through them,\" Starbird told me. Under the circumstances, her e-mails became a fount of quotable material for the conspiracists.\n\nLink copied\n\nBy then, campus police had alerted her to a complaint someone submitted alleging that she was abusing people via satellite; later, she received a death threat. \"No one in the rest of the world knew this was happening,\" Starbird said. \"But anyone in the right-wing media ecosystem and the few of us who were targeted were hyperaware.\" In the run-up to the midterm elections last November, when Republicans were expected to retake control of the House and the Senate, Starbird began warning colleagues, \"There are going to be investigations.\"\n\nThe current Republican House was sworn in at the start of this year with more of a complex than an agenda. The Democrats still controlled the Senate and the White House, so legislating wasn't an option. Even if it were, the Republican conference was too divided to reach any consensus on policy. On the Hill, the different ideological factions inside the Party were known as the Five Families; the most unruly of these was the House Freedom Caucus, a group of thirty-three hard-line anti-institutionalists. The closest the conference came to a proactive message was its vow to investigate Joe Biden and to fight the scourge of the federal bureaucracy. \"You have agencies that we know have spied on the American people, have suppressed the speech of the American people, have targeted members of the populace,\" Byron Donalds, a Florida Republican, told me. \"We're the ones really trying to save democracy.\"\n\nDuring the race for House Speaker in January, twenty members of the Freedom Caucus withheld their votes from McCarthy. In exchange for their support, they made numerous demands; one of them was the creation of a freestanding committee to uncover how the federal government was supposedly cracking down on conservatives. McCarthy appeased them, in part, by agreeing to create a subcommittee run out of the Judiciary Committee and led by Jordan, who had helped found the Freedom Caucus, in 2015. More than anyone in the House at the time, several G.O.P. insiders told me, Jordan held the key to McCarthy's Speakership.\n\nEver since the revelation, in March, 2017, that the F.B.I. had opened a probe into the Trump campaign's alleged ties with Russia, Jordan had been demanding that Congress \"investigate the investigators.\" In the summer of 2018, Jordan introduced articles of impeachment against Rod Rosenstein, the Deputy Attorney General, who had appointed a special counsel to investigate Russian interference in the election. The next year, when Trump faced his first impeachment, Jordan organized the President's defense on the Hill. After Trump lost the 2020 election, few Republicans amplified his lies about fraud and vote theft more vociferously than Jordan. \"I don't know how you can ever convince me that President Trump didn't actually win this thing,\" he said that December. \"Sometimes you gotta beat the referee.\"\n\nOn January 2, 2021, Jordan led a conference call with Trump to discuss how they could delay certifying the election. One of the ideas was to encourage Trump supporters, via social media, to march on the Capitol on January 6th. Jordan spoke routinely with the President by phone during the next few days, including twice on January 6th, and he texted Trump's chief of staff with advice on how to get Vice-President Mike Pence not to count electoral votes. Hours after the insurrection, Jordan stationed himself next to the House floor to whip votes against certification. Before leaving office, Trump gave him the country's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Jordan, Trump has said, \"is a warrior for me.\"\n\nAround the time that Starbird joined the Election Integrity Partnership, Jordan was calling for a major investigation into partisan censorship. \"I'll just cut right to the chase,\" he said at a hearing of the Judiciary Committee. \"Big Tech is out to get conservatives. That's not a suspicion. That's not a hunch. That's a fact.\" He listed half a dozen instances: Google \"censoring\" Breitbart and the Daily Caller, YouTube blocking content that violated Covid recommendations made by the World Health Organization, Facebook taking down a post from Trump's reëlection campaign. \"I haven't even mentioned Twitter,\" Jordan said. \"Four members of Congress were shadow-banned two years ago.\" This was a reference to a brief period in which Jordan and his fellow-Republicans Matt Gaetz, Mark Meadows, and Devin Nunes couldn't get their names to autofill on Twitter's search bar, something the company called a glitch and promptly fixed. \"Four hundred thirty-five members in the House, a hundred in the Senate,\" Jordan continued. \"Only four. Only four!\"\n\nFrom his perch as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, Jordan oversaw the production of a thousand-page report, released four days before the 2022 midterms, titled \"FBI Whistleblowers: What Their Disclosures Indicate About the Politicization of the FBI and Justice Department.\" It was mostly a compilation of angry letters mailed by the committee to various agency officials, claiming that the federal government had \"spied on President Trump's campaign and ridiculed conservative Americans.\"\n\nJordan currently has a hand in every major investigation under way in the House. He is a member of the Oversight Committee, and, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, he controls a staff of more than sixty and a nineteen-million-dollar budget, nearly triple what it was under the Democrats. This summer, when an I.R.S. whistle-blower appeared before the House Ways and Means Committee to share confidential information about Hunter Biden's taxes, Jordan's chief counsel, a veteran lawyer named Steve Castor, was permitted to work with the committee. The arrangement was a highly unusual work-around; by law, members of Ways and Means cannot share citizens' tax information with anyone outside the committee. Now someone close to Jordan, who is not on the committee, had direct access to a sensitive probe.\n\nWhat immediately distinguished the Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government-the new body created by McCarthy at the behest of the Freedom Caucus-was the broadness of its scope. The targets ran the gamut from \"tech censorship\" to F.B.I. responses to violence at school-board meetings. The primary victims, as the Republican subcommittee members saw it, included January 6th protesters, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., pro-lifers, and parents enraged by the liberalism of their children's schools. \"Normally, when you have a subcommittee, it's studying something specific and substantive that everyone can agree happened, like the break-in at a party headquarters or an attack on the Capitol,\" Matthew Green, an expert on Congress at Catholic University, in Washington, D.C., told me. \"Here there's a bunch of premises that are really only circulating among conservatives.\"\n\nJordan, who entered Congress after a dozen years in the Ohio state legislature, has an unusual background for a career politician. Growing up in St. Paris, Ohio-where he and his wife, who have been together since he was thirteen, still live-Jordan was a high-school wrestling champion. He went on to win two national championships at the University of Wisconsin, and was later inducted into the National Wrestling Hall of Fame. For nearly a decade, he was the assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University. During that time, the university's trainer sexually abused a hundred and seventy-seven male athletes; the predation was, according to a subsequent investigation, \"an open secret.\" Many years later, after Jordan had risen to national prominence, several of the victims accused him of knowing about the abuse and covering it up, which Jordan has repeatedly denied.\n\nJordan arrived in Washington in January, 2007, dressed the same casual way he does now. \"I remember thinking, Who the hell is this guy?\" a senior staffer at the time told me. \"He's a freshman. He just got elected, and he's not wearing a jacket?\" Newcomers were typically out of their depth and needed staff to coach them through the arcana of House procedure. Somehow Jordan seemed already to know his way around, according to the staffer. \"He was starting to build his brand as a rabble-rouser.\"\n\nJordan's pugnacity was his chief political selling point. He quickly \"realized that oversight and attacking Democrats was the easiest way to enhance his standing with the conservative base,\" a former top aide in House leadership told me. \"He took opportunities to live on Fox News and bash the Dems, whether his investigations had merit or not.\" A certain talent drew him to scandals of Manichean dimensions, in which Democrats were the aggressors and Republicans the champions of just causes. \"He has a memory for faces and details,\" someone who worked closely with him told me. \"When he studies up and deep dives on something, it sticks and doesn't unstick.\"\n\nAnd yet, for years, the defining aspect of Jordan's brand involved positioning himself in opposition to Republican leadership. In 2011, a new crop of anti-establishment freshmen, mobilized by the Tea Party, threatened to force a federal default if the Republican Speaker of the House, John Boehner, didn't slash the budget. When a last-minute deal was reached with the White House, many of them relented. Jordan vowed to fight on. Two years later, in an effort to defund Obamacare, he joined a group of conservative Republicans who shut down the government. An ally of Boehner's described them as \"lemmings with suicide vests.\"\n\nIn 2015, Jordan and other members of the Freedom Caucus tried to oust Boehner as Speaker. After Boehner resigned in exasperation, deeming them \"legislative terrorists,\" Jordan led the campaign to sabotage his heir apparent, Kevin McCarthy. A year later, when Paul Ryan was Speaker, Jordan was an architect of yet another plot. The plan was for him to travel to the Fox News studios in New York and declare, on air, that he would challenge Ryan for the job. Jordan didn't have the votes to beat him, but the thought was that a dramatic confrontation would make Ryan look weak, so that someone friendlier to Jordan's interests could take the job. Before he could carry out his plan, though, someone tipped off the press. According to \"The Hill to Die On,\" by Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer, one night in the fall of 2016, while Jordan was scheming with Freedom Caucus allies in the Washington apartment of Mark Meadows, a group of reporters gathered outside. Jordan escaped through the parking garage and hid in the back seat of a staffer's jeep until they dispersed.\n\nDuring the 2016 Presidential campaign, when other establishment Republicans were openly critical of Trump, Jordan was one of his staunchest defenders. In Trump, the Freedom Caucus had a Republican candidate whose madcap charisma could accommodate its insurrectionary style. Trump was obsessed with Jordan's past life as a wrestling champion. At one meeting, in June, 2017, Trump kept interrupting a discussion on tax policy to ask whether it was true that Jordan had been the best wrestler in the country. When Jordan demurred, Trump said, \"Admit it. You're a winner. You were the best.\"\n\nIn November, 2018, the Republicans held a vote for Minority Leader, the Party's top job in the upcoming term. Jordan decided to run against McCarthy and lost badly. Several days later, while working out in the House gym, he received a call from McCarthy, who offered him the ranking-member position on the Oversight Committee. (\"The Oversight Committee is where you take on the left,\" Jordan wrote in his political memoir. It is \"the closest thing to a wrestling match that members of Congress can get.\") The appointment was a major concession for McCarthy, but, from his perspective, turning an insurgent into a beholden ally was a matter of survival. \"Jordan had a strategy and he stuck to it,\" Carlos Curbelo, a Florida Republican who worked with both men, told me. \"It was McCarthy who went to him. Jordan never conceded much.\"\n\nWith the support of Trump's base and the far right, Jordan was already a political force, but now he had an actual path to institutional power in the House. \"There's a pre-2018 Jim Jordan and a post-2018 Jim Jordan,\" the former House leadership aide told me. \"He realized the importance of having a relationship with McCarthy. Having that relationship gave him a lot more power without much responsibility.\"\n\nThe key component of any durable conspiracy theory is a partial truth-something that intersects with reality just enough to lend credence to the broader invention. Republicans attacking the practice of content moderation have hit on a largely unsettled legal question. Under the First Amendment, Facebook and Twitter can make independent decisions according to their own policies, but the Biden Administration has repeatedly pressured them to take down content, especially on Covid and vaccines. The track record of social-media companies in complying with these requests is mixed. When they have done the government's bidding, however, Republicans have cried foul. \"Obviously the government has a legitimate role to play in insuring that dangerous public-health misinformation doesn't spread on social media,\" Jameel Jaffer, the director of the Knight First Amendment Institute, at Columbia University, told me. \"But First Amendment scholars are actually quite unsure how to draw this line.\"\n\nBoth the government and the tech platforms have made some high-profile mistakes. In October, 2020, Twitter restricted access to a New York Post story with details on Hunter Biden's laptop, out of concern that it was the product of a Russian \"hack and leak\" operation. The lab-leak theory about the origin of Covid was written off by public-health officials as misinformation in the early months of the pandemic; today, it seems far less outlandish. \"The lesson from that is to find interventions that leave space for dissent,\" Jaffer said. \"The lesson isn't that nobody should make any effort to curate or edit. That can't be the lesson we draw from this, that Facebook or the government has to treat everything equally.\"\n\nThe Election Integrity Partnership was associated with a government body that, for a time, was uncontroversial. It was called the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA . Trump created the agency in 2018, by signing a law to protect critical infrastructure from cybersecurity threats. Later, his second Secretary of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen, directed CISA to address false information that could undermine the country's voting systems. \"It had existential consequences not only for the mission of D.H.S. but for democratic institutions,\" Robert Schaul, who worked at the agency at the time, told me. \"She saw it as a broader mission.\"\n\nThe idea for the Election Integrity Partnership initially came from Stanford students who had interned at CISA and felt that more could be done to support election officials. \"The E.I.P. wasn't something that was pushed or proffered by D.H.S.,\" Schaul said. \"The research community decided to organize and then reached out to CISA for a little bit of leverage. All their connections to the platforms were their connections to the platforms.\" By design, he went on, \"we were never directing research or making specific requests. We had to protect our brand. Even being an intermediary could be a liability. No deep-state stuff. Just states and private industry.\"\n\nSchaul worked at CISA under Trump and Biden, and felt that the agency operated better with Trump as President. The White House was so distracted by chaos and infighting, he said, that \"the experts could actually do their jobs.\" Nevertheless, in November, 2020, Trump fired the agency's widely respected head, Chris Krebs, after he contradicted the President's claims that the election was stolen.\n\nA year later, Jen Easterly, Biden's new director of the agency, asked Starbird to lead a CISA advisory subcommittee on disinformation. In practice, this meant nine months of unpaid work in which, for about two hours each week, Starbird and the other members would meet with CISA personnel to discuss complex questions about how the government could counter disinformation threats. Sitting with her on the subcommittee was Vijaya Gadde, Twitter's chief legal officer, who'd been involved in deciding to ban Trump from the platform after January 6th. Eventually, they wrote a series of general recommendations. \"We didn't coördinate with platforms or recommend that CISA coördinate with platforms to moderate content,\" Starbird told me. Her approach to undertaking potentially controversial work like advising the U.S. government was to manage the things that critics might misconstrue. She wouldn't bend herself \"into a pretzel\" to avoid conflict, she said, but neither would she \"throw them softballs.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nIronically, it was a separate D.H.S. initiative that caused a scandal. In late April, 2022, the Biden Administration announced the formation of the Disinformation Governance Board. Headed by an author named Nina Jankowicz, who had written about election interference and online warfare, it had no operational authority; its main task was to align the department's different projects addressing disinformation-\"to make sure that people were talking to each other,\" Jankowicz told me. Within hours of the announcement, the pro-Trump influencer Jack Posobiec, who had nearly two million followers on Twitter, tweeted that the Biden Administration had created a \"Ministry of Truth.\" By the end of the day, there were more than fifty thousand tweets mentioning the board or Jankowicz. Within a week, they would be cited in roughly seventy per cent of the one-hour segments on Fox News.\n\nJordan marshalled right-wing outrage from the House floor. The day after the board's announcement, during a hearing at the Judiciary Committee, he confronted Biden's Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas, who had promoted the effort. \"You said that misleading narratives . . . undermine the trust in government,\" Jordan said. He went down a list of talking points about Anthony Fauci, COVID vaccines, and the intelligence community. \"Will you be looking into that?\" he asked.\n\nFor reasons obscure even to Jankowicz, the Biden Administration struggled to explain the board's actual job to Congress and to the broader public. That summer, D.H.S. shut it down. Jankowicz, who was pregnant at the time, faced a torrent of death threats and harassment. \"It was shocking to see how quickly it went from Posobiec saying that this is the Ministry of Truth to Jordan making this his raison d'être,\" Jankowicz told me. \"It was a single day.\"\n\nThat December, Jankowicz was at Heathrow Airport, catching a connecting flight, when she received a text message from a reporter at CNN asking her to comment on a letter from Jordan threatening to subpoena her. She hadn't yet received it. \"Jordan posted the letter on his Twitter profile,\" she told me. \"He put my home address on the letter. I had to have a friend at D.H.S. congressional affairs and my lawyer call committee staff.\"\n\nSeveral months later, after Jordan subpoenaed Jankowicz, she decided to sue Fox News for defamation, saying that the network had lied about her work on the board. (Fox has moved to dismiss the case on First Amendment grounds.) \"Jim Jordan subpoenaing me is the thing that made me want to sue Fox,\" she told me. \"They're all feeding off one another.\"\n\nStarbird learned about the Disinformation Board only after it was publicly announced, but what played out next was something she had studied extensively. It's known among experts as the \"transitive property of disinformation.\" As Starbird put it, \"If A has ever talked to B, and B has ever talked to C, and you can say something bad about C, then you can smear A and B. You can smear everybody just by smearing one group.\" Because the Disinformation Board was based at D.H.S., the department's other agencies were implicated, as were the researchers tied to them. Online conspiracists were now saying that the Election Integrity Partnership was the \"precursor\" to the Disinformation Board and that the group's own final report demonstrated precisely how it had colluded with D.H.S. to censor millions of tweets during the election.\n\nJordan may be the face of the weaponization subcommittee, but the idea for its creation began with a series of conversations among three hyper-conservative members of the Republican Party: Russell Vought, Trump's former head of the Office of Management and Budget, and the Freedom Caucus members Dan Bishop and Chip Roy.\n\nTheir goal was to reconstitute the Church Committee, a bipartisan select committee convened in the mid-nineteen-seventies and headed by the Democratic senator Frank Church. It investigated the abuses of the C.I.A., the F.B.I., and the National Security Agency, including their surveillance of U.S. citizens and their role in fomenting political assassinations and right-wing coups abroad. The committee's work, the journalist James Risen writes in \"The Last Honest Man,\" his recent biography of Church, \"marked the first time there had been any serious congressional inquiry into the national-security state. As a result, the Church Committee's hearings became something like a constitutional convention, airing basic questions about the proper balance between liberty and security.\"\n\nVought is now the president of the far-right group Center for Renewing America, which operates under the aegis of the Conservative Partnership Institute, a lavishly funded network that many in Washington consider the Trump Administration in exile. His animus against the F.B.I., like Jordan's, began in 2016, when the Bureau surveilled members of the Trump campaign-the \"Russia-collusion hoax,\" he said. He likens the government to the mansion on the television show \"Downton Abbey.\" The deep state is the first floor. \"As a Cabinet secretary, you're the second floor,\" he told me. \"Everything is happening in the kitchen. And they wall it off.\"\n\nWe met one afternoon in August at a town house on Independence Avenue, in Washington, that belongs to the Conservative Partnership Institute. On the walls were framed political cartoons featuring Jim DeMint, the former South Carolina senator and president of the Heritage Foundation, in different mythic poses. In one, he was a vulture regally perched on the top of a headstone bearing the words \"RIP: Immigration Bill.\"\n\nWhen Vought first broached his idea for a modern-day Church Committee, people asked him if the concept was religious. The name, he explained, \"would mean something to the agencies themselves. It changed their culture. And we wanted to put that shot across their bow.\" Vought envisioned a well-resourced, high-profile committee that could do unfettered fact-finding. Who, for instance, was making decisions about security clearances? \"We know there is a massive problem,\" he said. \"I want actual offices, people, names.\" He called these the \"nodes of weaponization.\" There needed to be serious investigations. In the process, he said, \"my hope would be that we would be getting reports from national news outlets that there are so many subpoenas going out that everyone is having to lawyer up. It'd put a constraint on the system.\"\n\nVought went public with his mission on August 8, 2022, the day the F.B.I. executed a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago. That night, he appeared on Laura Ingraham's show, on Fox News. Kevin McCarthy, for his part, also started embracing the idea of a law-enforcement probe after the Mar-a-Lago search. \"I've seen enough,\" he tweeted. The D.O.J. \"has reached an intolerable state of weaponized politicization.\"\n\nIn late November, after the Republicans won the midterms, Jordan wrote to the F.B.I. director, Christopher Wray, instructing him to preserve documents for an impending investigation. The following month, he sent letters to Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Alphabet. A year earlier, when Jordan was subpoenaed by the January 6th Committee, he had ignored it. But now that he was entering the majority with a chairman's gavel he would have the power to compel people to testify. In early 2023, he created a small subcommittee on \"Responsiveness and Accountability to Oversight,\" with the singular purpose of enforcing subpoenas. \"They exist to haul in the top leadership of agencies for refusing to respond fast enough,\" a committee staffer told me.\n\nOn January 10, 2023, in a party-line vote, the House formed the weaponization subcommittee. Its members have since interviewed more than eighty people-from former intelligence officials and F.B.I. personnel to tech-company employees and academic researchers. It has obtained some six hundred and fifty thousand pages of documents through subpoenas. \"The D.O.J. is prosecuting the Republican candidate for President,\" someone close to the subcommittee told me. \"This is the Republican counter to the January 6th Committee. It's counterprogramming to the Trump indictments.\" (A spokesperson for the subcommittee said that its \"ongoing investigation centers on the federal government's involvement in speech censorship, and the investigation's purpose is to inform legislative solutions for how to protect free speech.\")\n\nDan Bishop, who is a member of the subcommittee, met me one morning at his office in Washington. The first time McCarthy mentioned the subject of a modern-day Church Committee on television, Bishop told me, \"I nearly fell out of my chair. I'd been saying this for months, and he'd listen, stone-faced.\" In a polite, almost apologetic voice, Bishop also said that he didn't trust me. I was a skeptic with a hostile agenda. But, he added, this was a cause that progressives typically embraced. He cited some unexpected sources: an article in the Intercept about how the F.B.I. entrapped a Black Lives Matter activist, along with a decades-old Senate Select Committee report on the Bureau's dubious methods for using informants against leftist activists accused of having ties to Communism. \"The F.B.I. spied on Frank Sinatra, John Lennon, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., and Muhammad Ali because they were national-security threats,\" Bishop has said. \"We owe it to the American people to reveal the rot within our federal government.\"\n\nJordan had recently threatened to hold Mark Zuckerberg in contempt of Congress unless he turned over e-mails documenting company-wide conversations at Meta about content moderation. Bishop, who has announced a bid for attorney general of North Carolina, seemed solemnly pleased. \"This is a very earnest effort,\" he told me. \"It could be bipartisan. Americans have the First Amendment right to information, even foreign propaganda.\"\n\nOf all the partisans spreading attacks against the researchers, the most significant was initially one of the most obscure. \"I don't think it's possible to have spent more hours a day on this,\" Mike Benz, of the Foundation for Freedom Online, has said. \"My wife calls it the man in the box because my whole life has just been listening to this whole network, day and night, and chronicling and archiving and explaining.\"\n\nBenz, a lawyer by training, describes himself on his organization's Web site as \"a former State Department diplomat responsible for formulating and negotiating US foreign policy on international communications and information technology matters.\" But a recent investigation by NBC News found that several years ago he maintained an online persona under which he posted explosively antisemitic and racist content. In one post, from 2017, he wrote, \"If I, a Jew, a member of the Tribe, Hebrew Schooled, can read Mein Kampf and think 'holy shit, Hitler actually had some decent points.' Then NO ONE is safe from hating you once they find out who is behind the White genocide happening all over the world.\" His inspiration, whom he credited with \"putting the puzzle together,\" was the alt-right influencer Milo Yiannopoulos. A year later, Benz stopped posting under his white-nationalist pseudonym and entered the federal government, taking a speechwriting job in the Department of Housing and Urban Development. He joined the State Department in November, 2020, but left a couple of months later, at the start of the Biden Administration.\n\nSince then, as the executive director of the Foundation for Freedom Online, where he appears to be the sole employee, he has focussed much of his attention on Renée DiResta, the research director of Stanford's Internet Observatory and one of Starbird's co-authors on the Election Integrity Partnership's final report. DiResta has a number of associations that are easy to misrepresent. As an undergraduate, she interned at the C.I.A. Before joining Stanford, she served as the research director of a controversial cybersecurity firm called New Knowledge. In 2017, during Roy Moore's Alabama Senate race, New Knowledge experimented with a small-scale disinformation campaign of its own. According to the Times , the effort included creating a Facebook account meant to draw in conservative voters. (DiResta was not working for the company at the time.) The next year, she testified before the Senate on Russian interference in the 2016 election; a team she led then wrote up a report for the Senate Intelligence Committee. On the Web site of the Foundation for Freedom Online, Benz outlined what he called DiResta's \"censorship industry career arc\" and wrote that \"the prominent role Renee DiResta plays in EIP-a government-partnered Internet censorship consortium-is particularly worrisome and disturbing.\"\n\nIn early December of 2022, a group of iconoclastic journalists-with the help of Elon Musk, who now owned Twitter-began publishing the Twitter Files, a series of viral posts that used the company's internal e-mails to argue that controversial speech by conservatives had been suppressed. One thread, by the journalist Matt Taibbi, detailed the story of the Post's blocked article on Hunter Biden's laptop. Another parsed Twitter's decision to suspend Trump even though some employees argued that the actual language of his tweets about January 6th didn't violate company policy.\n\nThe publication of the Twitter Files supercharged the allegations against the Election Integrity Partnership, because it highlighted instances of content moderation that appeared to have gone too far. Two weeks after the first installment, Trump posted a six-minute video on Truth Social, his social-media network, announcing his \"free-speech platform\" for a second term. Promising to \"shatter the left-wing censorship regime,\" Trump vowed to fire federal bureaucrats at D.H.S., the D.O.J., and the F.B.I. who \"directly or indirectly\" interacted with tech companies to take down misleading information online about the 2020 election, Covid , or the efficacy of vaccines. He went on to say, \"If any U.S. university is discovered to have engaged in censorship activities or election interference in the past, such as flagging social-media content for removal or blacklisting, those universities should lose federal research dollars and federal student-loan support for a period of five years or more.\"\n\nOn March 2nd of this year, in a Twitter Spaces conversation attended by some thirty-nine thousand users, Benz made contact with Taibbi. \"I've been hoping to talk to you for a long time because I believe I have all of the missing pieces of the puzzle,\" he told Taibbi, according to a recording of the conversation. \"You're someone who can actually communicate the story to a large platform. I can tell you literally everything.\" The E.I.P., Benz said, was \"the deputized disinformation flagger for D.H.S.\" He went on, \"Basically, they gave this private group-E.I.P.-D.H.S.-F.B.I. powers to talk directly to the key content-moderation liaisons.\" Taibbi responded, \"I'm very anxious to talk to you.\"\n\nA week later, at Jordan's invitation, Taibbi and another journalist involved in the Twitter Files, Michael Shellenberger, gave public testimony before the weaponization subcommittee. While they addressed the members, Benz, dressed in a dark suit, sat in the row behind them. Both Taibbi and Shellenberger cited the E.I.P. and the twenty-two million censored tweets, though that figure never appeared in the materials they'd published in the Twitter Files. Afterward, they acknowledged that Benz had helped them with their testimony. Evidently, it was his influence that led Shellenberger to call the E.I.P. \"the seed of the censorship-industrial complex.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nThey weren't alone in relying on Benz. By then, he claimed to have given eight congressional briefings, spoken regularly with congressmen and senators, and addressed members of the House Oversight, Homeland Security, and Judiciary Committees. On March 10th, Jordan sent letters to Starbird, DiResta, and Alex Stamos, the head of Stanford's Internet Observatory, demanding access to e-mails and other communications with both the government and the tech platforms dating back to January, 2015.\n\nWithin days, Taibbi posted another thread in the Twitter Files about the \"Great Covid-19 Lie Machine: Stanford, the Virality Project, and the Censorship of 'True Stories.' \" After the 2020 election, many of the researchers involved in the Election Integrity Partnership had regrouped and launched the Virality Project, making its mission the tracking of online misinformation surrounding Covid vaccines. This time, the mechanics of the operation were simpler. D.H.S. was not involved. Researchers posted their findings online each week and sent them to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Surgeon General. Taibbi's thread, which received more than forty million views, rearranged information that Stanford had already been making available. \"Even though all of our work is public, they reframed it as a secret cabal,\" DiResta told me. \"I study rumors and propaganda, but that doesn't mean we can do anything to stop them when we become the subject. It's a problem for the field. What can you do when it happens?\"\n\nStudents began receiving requests from Jordan and Bishop to appear for voluntary, three-to-four-hour videotaped interviews. The public-records campaign against Starbird ramped up in the spring. DiResta said, \"Matt Taibbi says something on a Twitter thread, and then members of Congress get to read my e-mails!\"\n\nAt ten o'clock in the morning on June 6, 2023, Starbird sat at a long wooden table on the second floor of the Rayburn House Office Building, in Washington, D.C., accompanied by her lawyers, to testify before the weaponization subcommittee. There were no reporters present, and the doors were closed to the public. A stenographer transcribed the proceedings, and a video recorder was placed across from Starbird. She was under strict instructions not to disclose the contents of the conversation she was about to have. \"Ms. Starbird,\" Jordan said, according to a transcript obtained by The New Yorker , \"what percentage of your funding is directly from the government?\" For five hours, she answered questions about her work, but that was the only one that Jordan himself asked.\n\nWhen Starbird and I spoke in July, she was about to fly across the country again, this time at the request of the House Homeland Security Committee. Bishop chairs its oversight subcommittee, and he had some more questions. According to multiple Republican and Democratic staffers, Bishop and Jordan were sometimes at odds. Bishop felt that Jordan could be doing more to push the investigation. When I asked one of the staffers what that meant, I was told, \"Jordan only pursues most of Mike Benz's theories. Bishop wants to run down all of them.\"\n\nAs of this past summer, Stanford University had spent close to a million dollars in legal fees. \"It makes you really wonder whether it's worth it,\" Alex Stamos told the subcommittee in June. \"My primary responsibility is to my wife and my three children, and it's very hard to justify for them-even if it's unfair-for them to be put at any kind of physical risk because I want to do academic research into the election.\"\n\nJaffer, the First Amendment expert, told me, \"Jordan seems to be suggesting that private researchers are in league with government officials, part of this grander conspiracy to suppress conservative speech, and that they should be held accountable for their role in that conspiracy.\" But suing them, Jaffer argued, was an affront to the First Amendment. Two decades ago, he pointed out, the Times sat on evidence of an N.S.A. secret wiretapping program for about a year at the government's request. By Jordan's theory, Jaffer asked, \"could the reporters be sued for having conspired with the N.S.A. not to publish certain things?\"\n\nThe tech companies were always reluctant to moderate speech. Political circumstances forced them into it: the foreign interference in the 2016 election, Trump's election lies four years later, the January 6th attack on the Capitol, a once-in-a-century pandemic. \"The winds have changed,\" Starbird told me. \"Any defenses we created in 2020 and 2022 are gone. The government has pressured the platforms not to do anything. That's a direct outgrowth of what's happened with the weaponization subcommittee.\"\n\nSchaul, formerly of CISA , told me, \"The attack on government responses to disinformation isn't necessarily meant to rein in government, because they don't believe in government approaches anyway. It's meant to be a harbinger of burdens to come for social-media platforms should they not clear space for bad actors.\" He described the end goal of Jordan, Benz, and others as the turning of social media into \" NATO for MAGA : keep the liberals out, the voters down, keep us in power.\"\n\nThe language and logic of Jordan's inquiry have already spread to other parts of government. On July 4th, a federal judge appointed by Trump issued a sweeping injunction in a case called Missouri v. Biden, blocking the Administration from having any contact with social-media companies or certain universities conducting research into misinformation. The original plaintiffs in the case were the Republican attorneys general of Missouri and Louisiana, who accused the White House, D.H.S., and the F.B.I. of colluding with Meta and Twitter to police the speech of conservatives on their platforms. \"The present case arguably involves the most massive attack against free speech in United States history,\" the judge said. The opinion was tendentious and riddled with factual errors, citing material from the Twitter Files and the weaponization subcommittee.\n\nIn August, after the federal ruling was appealed, eight members of the weaponization subcommittee submitted an amicus brief in the appellate case, citing exclusive documents and statements obtained through its interviews and subpoenas. Filing it on their behalf were lawyers from America First Legal, a group that is run by Trump's former political adviser Stephen Miller, and is part of the Conservative Partnership Institute. The litigants in Missouri v. Biden had claimed that their First Amendment rights had been restricted, but in doing so they had curtailed those of scientists, academics, and researchers. \"Now we can't talk to local and state election officials,\" Starbird told me at the time. \"I don't think they would talk to a set of academics now. The people that need help don't have anywhere to turn.\"\n\nLast month, the conservative Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld some of the lower-court ruling, finding that the Biden Administration had \"coerced or significantly encouraged social media platforms to moderate content\" related to Covid -19 misinformation, thus violating the First Amendment. Yet the panel took issue with the previous judge's preliminary injunction, on the ground that it was \"both vague and broader than necessary to remedy the Plaintiff's injuries.\"\n\nThe researchers, no longer tied by the injunction, were momentarily relieved. Still, they had cause for anxiety. A parallel lawsuit against them, also handled by America First Legal, was moving through civil court, in the same district as Missouri v. Biden. Starbird, DiResta, Stamos, and other figures and organizations involved in the Election Integrity Partnership were accused of being part of an effort that \"tramples\" on the First Amendment by engaging in \"probably the largest mass-surveillance and mass-censorship program in American history-the so-called 'Election Integrity Partnership' and 'Virality Project.' \" The two plaintiffs in the case were claiming personal injury. One was Jim Hoft, the founder of the Web site the Gateway Pundit. The other was a woman from Louisiana named Jill Hines, who runs a small advocacy organization that is critical of the C.D.C., vaccines, and Anthony Fauci, whom she calls \"a Karen.\" Starbird told me, \"This past year, I spent more time with my lawyers than with my students.\"\n\nA week after McCarthy was voted out as Speaker, I sat down with Ken Buck, one of the eight Republicans who had set the whole plot in motion. Buck is a fiscal hawk from Colorado and a member of the Freedom Caucus. It was late in the afternoon, about an hour before Jordan would make his case for Speaker at a closed-door meeting of Republicans. Buck, who'd just come from the airport, had no regrets about his decision to move against McCarthy, but he wasn't happy with the current front-runner to replace him.\n\nOver the next several days, Jordan's run for Speaker intensified. He lost the first round of voting to an old establishment hand, but stayed in the running because no one could come close to the two hundred and seventeen votes necessary to clinch the job. Many who opposed Jordan, recognizing his overwhelming power with the base, were careful not to antagonize him-not that it mattered. The wife of a Nebraska moderate received menacing text messages and phone calls from anonymous critics of her husband. A congresswoman from Iowa fielded what her office called \"credible\" death threats. E-mails had also been circulating. Producers from Sean Hannity's show on Fox News were contacting Jordan's opponents with a script making it clear that they'd be forced to answer for their intransigence. It was unnerving to see how quickly Jordan's bullying, honed by tormenting Democrats, could be directed at members of his own Party. Still, with each subsequent vote, Jordan fell short. On the afternoon of October 20th, in a secret ballot, a majority of the Republican conference voted for him to end his candidacy.\n\nBuck had been one of the holdouts. \"The Jim Jordan of 2015 would not recognize the Jim Jordan of 2023,\" he told me. \"If George W. Bush lied about the outcome of an election, Jim Jordan would have been all over him.\" But the issue Buck considered the most indicative of Jordan's lost principles was Big Tech. They were both passionate about taking on the platforms, but, whereas Buck saw companies like Meta and Google as monopolies that the government should break up, Jordan had seen an opportunity for a fight with a more immediate political payoff: demonizing Big Tech as a threat to all Republicans. If you don't pursue anti-trust policies, Buck noted, \"you can scream all you want about how they colluded with the Biden Administration.\" He told me to read up on Lyndon Johnson. \"Jim made a decision on what he wants to do, and he has followed a path,\" Buck said. \"People who want power find a way to get there.\" ♦\n\nAn earlier version of this article mischaracterized the involvement between tech platforms and the Virality Project.\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "website": "https://www.newyorker.com",
      "text": "The Symbiotic, Democracy-Eroding Relationship Between Donald Trump and Jim Jordan\n\nOn Tuesday, Donald Trump was back in New York to attend his civil trial on charges of business fraud, and, as usual, he stopped directly outside the courtroom to attack the prosecutor, New York's attorney general, Letitia James; and the judge, Arthur F. Engoron. \"They are the frauds,\" Trump said, repeating his false allegation that James and Engoron personally valued his Mar-a-Lago estate at eighteen million dollars. (In fact, a Palm Beach property appraiser valued the property at between $18 million and $27.6 million.) Trump has denied all wrongdoing.\n\nThe former President's latest rant came a day after U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan-who is overseeing his federal trial in Washington, D.C., on charges relating to his failed effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election-imposed a partial gag order on him, saying that he is not allowed \"to launch a pretrial smear campaign against participating government staff, their families, and foreseeable witnesses.\" In recent months, Trump has repeatedly referred to the special counsel Jack Smith, who is overseeing the case's prosecution, as \"deranged.\" He has also attacked Mike Pence , his former Vice-President, and the retired general Mark Milley, who was formerly the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff-both of whom may well be called to testify about what they saw in the period after the 2020 Presidential election.\n\nAs Trump was renewing his assault on the courts, one of his staunchest allies in Washington, the Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, was making a bid to become the next Speaker of the House. In an initial floor vote, Jordan fell well short of the tally he needed, with twenty Republican representatives voting against him. The G.O.P. caucus subsequently indicated that it would hold another vote on Wednesday, and Jordan said, \"We're going to keep working.\"\n\nIf Jordan were to be elected Speaker, it would signal that the Republican Party on Capitol Hill had formally accepted its role as a mere appendage to an insurrectionary right-wing movement led by a self-aggrandizing megalomaniac. Jordan was a key point man in the House for Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Since then, in his roles as head of the House Judiciary Committee and chair of the new House Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government, he has acted as a mouthpiece for the former President and his efforts to discredit his accusers. Earlier this year, Jordan called for defunding parts of the F.B.I. and the Justice Department.\n\nIn seeking a limited gag order from Judge Chutkan, lawyers acting for the special counsel pointed out that, just as Trump's statements after the 2020 election were designed to undermine public faith in the U.S. political system, his attacks on judges, prosecutors, and potential witnesses \"are intended to undermine public confidence in an institution-the judicial system-and to intimidate individuals.\" Trump's ultimate goal is the same one shared by all would-be despots: to discredit the existing system and liberate themselves from the normal bounds of democratic politics.\n\nCampaigning in Iowa, Trump responded to Chutkan's ruling by portraying himself as a victim and saying he would be \"the only politician in history that runs with a gag order where I'm not allowed to criticize people.\"  Actually, Chutkan clearly stated that Trump \"may still vigorously seek public support as a Presidential candidate, debate policies and people related to that candidacy, criticize the current administration and assert his belief that this prosecution is politically motivated.\" She added, \"But I cannot imagine any other criminal case in which a defendant is permitted to call the prosecutor 'deranged' or 'a thug,' and I will not permit it here simply because the defendant is running a political campaign.\"\n\nDespite Chutkan's ruling, the courts are still giving Trump a good deal of leeway because he is a former President running for reëlection. If any other defendant stood outside a court and called the judge and prosecutors frauds who were trying to set him up, they would risk being held in contempt, and maybe even being thrown in the slammer. Trump exploits his privilege, knowing that judges like to avoid political controversy and that elected Republicans like Jordan will back him up no matter what he says or does.\n\nDuring Trump's 2016 election campaign, Jordan supported the future President and made his bones with the candidate by publicly campaigning for him shortly after the \"Access Hollywood\" tape was released. After the 2020 election, Jordan repeatedly expounded Trump's baseless charges that the election had been stolen. On January 5, 2021, according to the Times , he forwarded to his friend Mark Meadows, Trump's chief of staff, a text message he had received from a former Pentagon official that outlined a legal strategy to overturn the election, and on the following morning he spoke with Trump himself for ten minutes before the former President headed out to address his supporters at the Ellipse.\n\n\"Jim Jordan was privy to nearly everything, if not everything, about and pertaining to January 6th,\" Cassidy Hutchinson, who served as a senior aide to Meadows in the Trump White House, says in a new Democratic political ad that targets Jordan. \"Jim Jordan can't be trusted with the Constitution.\" Hutchinson is no Democrat; she just knows a Trump enabler when she sees one. Despite being in his ninth term as the representative of Ohio's Fourth District, Jordan has yet to be the primary sponsor of a bill that has been enacted. Rather than making laws, he has concentrated on the politics of protest and performance, co-founding the House Freedom Caucus and consistently undermining efforts to forge bipartisan agreements on spending and other issues. The former G.O.P. Speaker John Boehner, in his 2021 memoir, said he \"never saw a guy who spent more time tearing things apart.\"\n\nIf Jordan still can't garner enough votes, the country will be spared the experience of having a \"legislative terrorist\" (Boehner's words again) in the Speaker's office. But the very destructive attributes that Boehner, Jordan's fellow Ohio Republican, identified in him make him a perfect ally for Trump, and a walking embodiment of a radicalized G.O.P.  That won't change, even if his Speaker bid fails because enough Republican representatives from Biden-majority districts hold the line and refuse to vote for such an extremist. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Jim Jordan's Singular Pursuit of Justice\n\nLast month, when Donald Trump was indicted in New York City, the House Republican Conference was already in a state of predictable disarray. To secure his job as Speaker, Kevin McCarthy had made contradictory promises to the moderate and far-right factions, and the Party's plans were sputtering. In late January, an extreme immigration and border bill that the Speaker was supposed to bring to the floor was pulled at the last minute, a victory for the moderates. In February, a new House panel led by Jim Jordan, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, held its first hearing on the \"weaponization of the federal government,\" an ostensible victory for the MAGA crowd, although the members couldn't agree on a target. Was it the F.B.I. or Big Tech, cancel culture or the Department of Justice? \"It was one of the worst hearings I've ever heard,\" a committee staffer told me. \"They brought an ex-F.B.I. guy to testify who left the Bureau in 1999.\" The oversight committee, which had vowed to investigate everything from Hunter Biden's laptop to the withdrawal from Afghanistan, was moving too slowly for the true believers and too fast for everyone else. Other chairmen were feeling defensive. \"There's a big difference between oversight where you have expertise and oversight to churn out press releases,\" a G.O.P. aide complained to Punchbowl News. On the debt ceiling, arguably the House Republicans' defining issue, the conference still didn't have a budget proposal.\n\nA sense of common purpose coalesced around Trump's arraignment , in New York, on April 4th. The Manhattan District Attorney, Alvin Bragg, a first-term Democrat, had charged the former President with thirty-four counts of business fraud for allegedly covering up a hush-money payment to a porn star. (Trump has pleaded not guilty.) In New York State, it is a felony to falsify business records in the execution or concealment of a crime; here, Bragg did not specify the crime-it may have consisted of tax fraud, skirting campaign-finance laws, or both-because he wasn't required to. The technicality of the infraction, he said, was the \"bread and butter\" of white-collar prosecutions, but it lacked the heft of the charges that Trump could still face elsewhere. In Georgia, he is under investigation for election fraud, while the Justice Department, which has opened a probe into his mishandling of classified documents, is also looking into Trump's efforts to overturn the election.\n\nThe finer points of the law were immaterial to the leadership of the G.O.P.'s most prominent House committees. Jordan and James Comer, who heads the oversight committee, had moved to counter Bragg before the indictment was even announced. Responding to a post that Trump published on Truth Social, in which he inaccurately predicted the timing of his own arrest, Jordan, Comer, and a third committee chair wrote a letter to Bragg demanding that the District Attorney's office provide testimony, communications, and documents about its Trump investigation. \"You are reportedly about to engage in an unprecedented abuse of prosecutorial authority,\" they told him. Bragg, Republican leaders went on to say, would have to come to the Hill to provide \"a good argument\" for indicting Trump; they planned to \"hold [him] . . . to account.\"\n\nOnce the indictment was unsealed, Jordan subpoenaed Mark Pomerantz, a former federal prosecutor who had investigated Trump in Bragg's office but resigned last year. Going after Pomerantz may have reflected a subtle shift in approach. Jordan, who had refused to testify after being subpoenaed by the January 6th committee, seemed to recognize that it would be impossible to force Bragg to turn over materials. \"Jordan is a MAGA animal, but he is surrounded by people who went to law school,\" the committee staffer told me. Bragg sued to block the subpoena and to prevent congressional Republicans from interfering in the case, and a federal judge scheduled a hearing for Wednesday. In the meantime, on Monday morning, while McCarthy was giving a speech at the New York Stock Exchange to allay concerns about the impending debt-ceiling fight, Jordan brought the fight to Bragg by holding a field hearing about crime in New York City.\n\nAt 9 A.M. , in a drab conference room at a federal building in lower Manhattan, eight witnesses sat in a row across from Jordan and his Democratic counterpart, Jerrold Nadler. Six of them were called by the Republicans, two by the Democrats. Their profiles made the plotlines of the hearing clear before the testimony began. Most of the witnesses on the Republican side had been touched by crime, including a bodega clerk named Jose Alba, who, after being attacked in his store, stabbed an assailant in self-defense, and Madeline Brame, whose son was murdered in Harlem in 2018. \"Today's hearing is about the administration of justice and keeping communities safe,\" Jordan said. Bragg, whom he called \"soft on crime,\" had advanced a \"radical political agenda\" from his first days in office, signing a memo directing prosecutors to limit charges in certain cases. \"The police do their job, they do the hard work, they go out on the streets, they catch the bad guys,\" Jordan said, \"then D.A.s don't do their job. Instead, they let bad guys roam the streets.\"\n\nThe Democrats' witnesses-Jim Kessler, from the think tank Third Way, and Rebecca Fischer, the executive director of New Yorkers Against Gun Violence-spoke about gun crimes and the relative safety of New York compared with other American cities. Kessler cited a report called \"The Red State Murder Problem,\" while Fischer pointed out that more than seventy per cent of the \"crime guns\" used in New York came from out of state. The aim of calling them to testify was to highlight Republican hypocrisy. How could you claim to care about crime while being indifferent to gun violence? \"We all grieve for the victims of violent crime, here in Manhattan and everywhere, but it is shameful that the Republicans on this Committee would use the pretext of violent crime as an excuse to play tourist in New York,\" Nadler said. The day's hearing, he added, was \"cynical, unethical, and . . . just plain dangerous.\"\n\nTo watch the proceedings was to float between two parallel universes. The Democrats talked about guns and Trump, sketching a map of America in which it was more dangerous to live in red states because of the widespread availability of weaponry. The Republicans had their own map of the menace of blue America: San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago. Their bêtes noires were progressive prosecutors. \"Your public safety as a resident is dramatically impacted by your district attorney and whether he or she is a Soros rogue prosecutor or a law-and-order prosecutor,\" Mike Johnson, the Republican from Louisiana, said. (He was quoting a report from the Heritage Foundation titled \"The Blue City Murder Problem.\") He has a crisp, lawyerly style that belies his insurrectionary politics. Bragg, he said, is \"probably the worst offender.\" It was a point echoed by Matt Gaetz, from Florida, who, in his brasher mode, used his time to complain about the \"Soros-ization of the United States Justice System.\"\n\nField hearings aren't new or inherently partisan. What was different this time was that Jordan was using the forum to stage a political attack. On Monday, the Republicans tried to deny this. They were as careful not to mention Trump as the Democrats were eager to name-check him. But, in February, according to the Times , one of Trump's lawyers wrote Jordan a note demanding that Congress investigate the \"egregious abuse of power\" by a \"rogue local district attorney.\" Jordan's subsequent letters to Bragg, coupled with the subpoena of Pomerantz, were aimed at disrupting the D.A.'s investigation through a combination of intimidation and harassment. \"Chairman Jordan claims he is seeking to conduct 'oversight,' \" Bragg's lawyers wrote in their lawsuit. \"But he has no power under the Constitution to oversee state and local criminal matters. By definition, then, he has no legitimate legislative purpose for issuing this subpoena.\"\n\nNo one in Washington expects anything substantive to come of these field hearings. But to consider them a distraction is to miss the Republican majority's new M.O. There's not enough unity in the conference to pass anything out of the House, so the marquee committees are touring the country to launch a permanent campaign against Biden and the Democrats. This year, the Judiciary Committee's budget, under Jim Jordan, is reportedly nineteen million dollars, up from $7.6 million a year ago. According to the Judiciary Committee's budget calculations, it spent a total of eight thousand dollars on travel in 2022; its projected travel budget for 2023 is two hundred and sixty-two thousand dollars. Some Democrats on the committee told me that they found out about Monday's field hearing at the same time as the general public. Last week, Adam Schiff told me, \"There's a danger we come to be numbed by the relentless assaults on the rule of law. What Jordan is saying with this hearing is that Trump is above the law. The relentlessness of the assault numbs us to the outrageousness of it.\" ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Jim Jordan's Speakership Bid Collapses, Democracy Dodges a Bullet\n\nThis week saw MAGA Republicans engage in extremist arm-wrestling in the House speaker race and the sins of the 2020 election subversion scheme begin to catch up with Donald Trump's closest allies. On this week's episode of the Amicus podcast, Dahlia Lithwick spoke to newly minted MacArthur genius grant recipient Ian Bassin of Protect Democracy to take a look at the stakes of this moment for American democracy. Protect Democracy's work focuses on the technical ways the law can be applied to protect election workers and inhibit disinformation while also addressing the big constitutional and cultural questions we must answer if we're going to reject authoritarianism. Their discussion of the utter mayhem unfolding around the House speaker contest, below, has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nDahlia Lithwick: I'm just going to turn to the Chaos Muppets for a minute. You know, one of the things that we are looking at this week is whatever it is that is happening in the speaker's race.\n\nI'm going to confess to you that a law professor friend sent me an email that chilled me to the bone this week, suggesting that if Jim Jordan won the speakership, he would simply never certify a Biden election win.\n\nBut I wonder if you could just help me understand what it means to have a nonfunctioning House of Representatives at this moment, what power is the speaker of the House going to have in the 2024 election, and whether the reforms you all made to the Electoral Count Reform Act can somehow sort of hedge against the absolute catastrophe we've seen unfolding for the last two weeks in the House?\n\nIan Bassin: Let's go from darkness to light. I'm going to agree with the law professor friend of yours. In advance of the 2020 election, one of my colleagues, Erica Newland, a brilliant attorney who served in the Office of Legal Counsel in the Department of Justice, was tasked by our team to dig into what were all of the mechanisms by which Congress could subvert the election results, and what were all the mechanisms by which those in Congress who were committed to their oaths of office and upholding our constitutional order could try to prevent the body from doing that. And after doing that research, after the inauguration, Erica commented on an internal call to our team that it occurred to her, as she dug into it, that if the current iteration of the Republican Party is in control of Congress on Jan. 6, 2025, there is no way that they will certify a win if it turns out that a Democrat is legitimately elected in the 2024 election.\n\nSo let that sink in. I still believe that that is the most likely outcome if the current Republican Party is in control of one or both of the houses of Congress. Now recall that the Congress that presides over the counting of Electoral College ballots is the new Congress that is elected in 2024. So whatever Congress is elected in 2024 will be seated on Jan. 3, 2025, and then will oversee the counting of Electoral College ballots on Jan. 6, 2025. So it's not the current Congress. It's the new one.\n\nBut all we have seen from the Republican Party over the last six years is that they are moving further and further and further in the direction of being entirely MAGA-fied or Trumpified. So, if they prevail in the 2024 election, it seems likely that that Congress will be even more Trumpified than the one that is sitting now, which is kind of hard to believe. That's the dark part of it.\n\nThe light part of it is that as much as it is terrifying, and should be, that 200-plus members of the Republican caucus voted to make Jim Jordan, Donald Trump's key lieutenant in the Congress, the speaker, as of the moment that we are recording this, that has been thwarted. A handful of GOP members in the House have stood firm and blocked Jim Jordan from being speaker. And it looks like we may end up with, essentially, is some form of compromise. ...\n\nAnd I think if that holds, and that's a big if , this is one of the most important developments in this country over the last seven-plus years. And here's why. I'm going to invoke another recent story in the news that I think is really important to pay attention to, which is the elections this past week in Poland. So, in Poland this past week, a coalition that ran from the center-right to the left united and pulled off a stunning upset of the illiberal nationalist and ever more authoritarian-leaning Law and Justice party , which has governed Poland for the better part of the last decade or so.\n\nWhy is that important? Because history teaches that the way to defeat authoritarian movements is to form a very broad pro-democracy coalition of people who typically disagree about policy and politics. This is why I talked about how our strategy at Protect Democracy is to build a broad coalition of pro-democracy progressives, moderates, and conservatives.\n\nLet's go back to the interwar period in Europe. During that time, there were far-right, extremist, authoritarian movements rising across the continent. In some countries, Belgium and Finland in particular, the mainstream center-right parties saw those extremists for what they were, as threats to the system, and they held their noses and formed a united coalition with their traditional opponents on the left to block those extremists from power.\n\nIn Italy and Germany, the mainstream center-right parties made a different calculation. They gambled that they could ride the energy of the far-right extremists to power, and sideline the leaders of those far-right movements. We know how tragically that gamble turned out. For most of the last six years, the American Republican Party, by and large, has chosen the German and Italian path.\n\nIf they continue to do that, I think we can expect similarly tragic results. But what we may be witnessing in the House this week is the first potential signs that they might choose the Belgian, Finnish, and Polish path, or at least enough of them. Now, I'm not naïve enough to be super optimistic about that just yet, because the Republican Party of late has not given me enough confidence to be super optimistic about that. But I continue to push for it, and I think we all need to continue to push for it, because I think it is the single most important thing we could do to save democracy in the United States. So I am cautiously optimistic that if, in fact, Speaker Pro Tempore Patrick McHenry does gain some degree of ongoing power to be speaker on the backs of some form of coalition, that may be one of the most positive signs we've seen in the last seven years that the United States will survive this moment.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Wrestlers Trying to Stop Jim Jordan From Becoming House Speaker\n\nRepublican Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan is trying to become the next speaker of the House of Representatives. On Tuesday, he lost his first vote on the full House floor to assume the role, with 20 of his fellow Republicans voting against him . As of this writing, further votes are being prepared, and it's unclear whether or not Jordan will ultimately succeed Kevin McCarthy as the chamber's leader. Jordan, who voted against certifying the 2020 election and often rages against the Biden crime family, will not get the support of any Democrats and will likely continue to face at least some Republican opposition.\n\nBut there's also a group outside Congress that's opposed to him becoming House speaker: Ohio State University wrestlers. Jordan was an assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State between 1987 and 1995, a period during which team physician Richard Strauss sexually abused male athletes at the school. As Sports Illustrated's Jon Wertheim has reported, at least 11 former wrestlers have said that Ohio State coaches, including Jordan, knew about the abuse and chose to do nothing. Jordan, meanwhile, has denied knowing anything about what Strauss was doing and has personally attacked the wrestlers who've said otherwise. Over the past week, the wrestlers have been firing back. One of them, Mike Schick, told NBC news, \"Do you really want a guy in that job who chose not to stand up for his guys? Is that the kind of character trait you want for a House speaker?\"\n\nThis week , on Slate's sports podcast Hang Up and Listen , Wertheim joined the hosts to discuss the wrestlers' choice to speak out, Jordan's time at Ohio State, and what both could mean for his prospective leadership bid in Congress. A portion of the conversation is transcribed below; it has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nJosh Levin: You have a piece out now about Jim Jordan and the wrestlers speaking out against him. But your first big reported story was published three years ago, and it was headlined \" Why Aren't More People Talking About the Ohio State Sex Abuse Scandal? \" Can you start by just telling us the baseline facts? What happened at Ohio State?\n\nJon Wertheim: For 20 years, a team doctor, Richard Strauss, was essentially a serial predator. He worked in the athletic department, and this was clearly-this was an open secret. There were coaches that even joked, If you don't run your wind sprints fast enough, we're going to make you see Dr. Strauss . He had a series of nicknames, and essentially every physical examination he gave athletes-all of them male, critically-it ended up in some instance of sexual assault, which ranged from inappropriate touching to outright rape. These are athletes, mostly nonrevenue sports, though some football. Middle America, '70s to late '90s, and there's power dynamic issues. There's a vocabulary issue. This obviously predates #MeToo. And essentially, these athletes later came to the realization that they had been sexually assaulted, sexually abused by this doctor. In 2018 there was a study commissioned, an independent investigation. Hundreds and hundreds of athletes came forward. There's since been more than 100 settlements.\n\nJim Jordan was the wrestling coach. A disproportionate number of the survivors were wrestlers, and Jim Jordan has absolutely denied ever having knowledge of Richard Strauss, despite-I think it's more than a dozen of his wrestlers now saying that's not the case. And I think, more importantly, as you referenced, Josh-what I think a lot of people find particularly galling is not only has he denied ever having heard of this, but has since essentially taken the institution's side and, by extension, taken the perpetrator's side and has sort of, one by one, dismissed these wrestlers.\n\nA lot of times, these are guys he coached. These are guys he recruited. And he has, one by one, explained why these survivors are not to be believed, why they have motivations for lying. And this has really caused quite a schism, certainly within the wrestling community and, I think, within Ohio State athletics. But for some reason, this has not seemed to have done anything to impede Jim Jordan's political career.\n\nStefan Fatsis: Jon, it beggars belief that Jim Jordan didn't know what was going on. Ohio State contested none of the findings of that internal report, right? And they've settled with more than 300 people, spending more than $60 million to settle cases. And there are still dozens and dozens of complaints outstanding. Why hasn't this gotten more traction and become more of an issue for him? Why has he been able to go on Fox News, as he did a few years ago, and accuse the victims of lying, effectively?\n\nWertheim: My sort of overarching theory here is that the same forces at play that enabled this predatory doctor to abuse athletes for 20 years-the lack of a vocabulary; the power imbalance, where these athletes didn't want to stir anything up or even risk not being medically cleared-the same reasons why this was able to persist for 20 years are the same reasons why this story never quite got the attention it deserved.\n\nIt's sort of indelicate and crass, perhaps, to compare scandals, but certainly in terms of sweep and scale and number of athletes impacted, this is far larger than what happened with Larry Nassar at Michigan State , or Joe Paterno [at Penn State] , or even at the University of Michigan . I think the fact that these are man-and-man, I think there's something about the culture of a locker room.\n\nAs I said, there's really been a split within the Ohio State wrestling community, where some of these athletes find it fiercely disloyal that Jim Jordan never said anything, that he denied doing anything, he breached every possible standard of care. But there also is this faction that thinks it's disloyal to bring this up. \"Hey, look, one of ours is this high-ranking congressman. This could be the guy who literally is third in line to be the president of the United States, and you are going to upend this by trotting out these old charges.\"\n\nSo, the long answer is, I think, that a lot of the same factors that have enabled this scandal and enabled this horrible predation to persist for so long for all these years, I think that's the same reason why this hasn't got the attention it probably deserves. And it's certainly the reason why I think Jim Jordan is able to continue his political ascent in spite of what would be some pretty damning fact pattern on its face.\n\nPablo Torre: But the ascent, Jon. It's not merely \"Wow, there's a tonnage of moral horrors in this guy's background, allegedly.\" It's also that he is himself alleging those same horrors upon others, right?\n\nThe narrative richness here is so on the nose and absurd. The idea that the guy who is alleging groomers and pedophiles everywhere is himself the assistant coach to a head coach, Russ Hellickson, who you write did attend some sort of reunion, right, with the wrestlers in which the head coach said, \"At the very least, I should have known more.\" And he had to grapple with all of this testimony firsthand.\n\nWertheim: That's a great point, Pablo. Here you have a politician, certainly a flank of a political party, that has absolutely weaponized sexual predation. It's \"groomers\" and \"pedos,\" and a lot of times it's without any basis of fact. But this is so vile-it can be weaponized to effective political use. It's Marjorie Taylor Greene. How many times has she thrown around that accusation? It's Elise Stefanik talking about \"pedo grifters were responsible for the shortage in baby formula.\"\n\nAnd here, a few seats down, your colleague actually had a real-life encounter with a sexual predator. And what did he do? According to more than a dozen athletes that he coached, he did nothing. And then, when he was confronted about these allegations years later, he not only continued his denial, but then is trying to tell us why the victims and the survivors all had an ulterior motive to lie. They know the truth; this guy had financial distress. This guy's been in prison. It's really ... hypocrisy and irony don't quite paint the dimensions of it. It's galling.\n\nLevin: Just so people know even more of the background: These aren't just vague suggestions that maybe Jim Jordan knew. There's a couple of specific things that you cite, Jon.\n\nDunyasha Yetts, a wrestler, says that he complained to Jordan that Richard Strauss attempted to pull down his shorts when he went to see Strauss about a thumb injury. He told Jordan about this, and Jordan told Dunyasha Yetts if Strauss ever approached him in a sexual manner he'd kill him.\n\nAnother wrestler, Dan Ritchie, says he was present when Jordan was informed of abuse from Strauss, and Jordan's response: \"If he did that to me, I'd snap his neck like a twig of dried balsa wood.\"\n\nNow, these sound like things that Jim Jordan would say; I obviously wasn't there. But just the level of specificity here, for these people-just to be conjuring it from thin air just completely defies logic. And yet, as we've been saying, Jordan [has persisted with] deny, deny, deny , and it doesn't seem to have impeded him in any way despite these extraordinarily specific recollections of these men.\n\nWertheim: The usual conversation in sports is sort of like, \"Should they have known? Did they know? Did the coach set up this plausible deniability?\" Here, you have guys who are recounting, with startling levels of exactitude, dialogue-\"And actually, I said this and he said that\"-with real specificity. There's also a referee who has absolutely zero incentive to lie-he wasn't even a team member-who says, \"Yes, Jim Jordan knew.\"\n\nYou just look at the fact pattern. You look at how long Richard Strauss had this reign of predation. You look at the physical dynamics: He was in the locker room. Pablo, you mentioned that there was a summit a few summers ago where the wrestlers got together and said, \"Listen, this is creating this rupture in the program.\" Who are now middle-aged men, some of them 50 and 60 years old, and said, \"We need to resolve this.\"\n\nThey were able to get together in central Ohio in a high school and have one of these [reckonings]. I think no one at the high school knew why there were a large number of middle-aged men in letter jackets wearing somber expressions walking into the high school. They were able to have what was like this tribal summit.\n\nAnd Russ Hellickson, who is sort of this hidebound coach who's now in his mid-70s, who has been denying this all along-I have multiple former wrestlers essentially say he didn't want to make a public statement, but at some level [at the summit] he admitted this dereliction of duty. He kept using the word: \"I knew he was quirky.\" But clearly, they had reached some sort of meeting of the minds. And the coach, without outright saying it, sort of admitted that there was an issue and he didn't address it as he should have.\n\nJim Jordan did not show up. Jim Jordan has never said anything. Mike DiSabato, one of the whistleblowers-there's one thing he said to me that I think we ought to ponder even if you didn't know, which, again, is implausible bordering on impossible based on the facts. But even if you want to give this guy every benefit of the doubt and say \"Jim Jordan didn't know,\" the fact that when he did know, he didn't pick up the phone and say, \"Oh my God, how are you doing? I'm so sorry. What can I do to be supportive?\" His first instinct was to go on national TV and explain why everyone making an allegation had a motivation to lie. That is almost more damning than his initial denial.\n\nYou look at the fact pattern and it is absolutely galling. At one point, Jim Jordan commissioned some sort of group to try and give these wrestlers talking points for why they ought to support him. Mark Coleman was an NCAA champion, this towering All-American wrestler for Ohio State, actually the UFC's first heavyweight champ. He had given a quote that essentially said, \"If Jimmy's saying he didn't know, he had dementia. We all knew. It was an open secret.\" That was consistent with the account of dozens of other wrestlers. And soon, Mark Coleman told me-he faced all sorts of pressure he wouldn't specify, but then he ended up walking that statement back and saying that actually, he didn't have firsthand knowledge; he was just speculating. Clearly, someone had gotten to him. Whatever Jim Jordan's errors of omission were in the late '80s and early '90s, I think what he's done subsequently is much more grievous.\n\nListen to the full conversation on Hang Up and Listen here.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Jim Jordan's Speaker Candidacy Is Neither Dead Nor Alive\n\nUpdate, Oct. 19, 12:15 p.m.: According to multiple reports including the Washington Post 's, Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan is pausing his effort to become speaker of the House and will support a plan to expand the authority of interim speaker Patrick McHenry and extend his tenure through January.\n\nOriginal post, Oct. 18, 5:50 p.m.: On Monday, Republican Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan appeared close to becoming speaker of the House. But on Tuesday, only 200 members of his 221-member party caucus voted for his candidacy on the House floor. It was more than twice as many no votes as he'd reportedly expected, and it left him 17 votes shy of the 217 he needs. (One of Jordan's supporters was unable to attend Tuesday's vote but has since returned to the Hill.) On Wednesday, he came back for another vote, and ... 22 members of his party voted against his candidacy, leaving him 18 votes short, which is more than 17.\n\nThe group of Republicans voting against Jordan, a major supporter of former President Donald Trump who was active in the efforts to prevent the certification of the 2020 presidential election on Jan. 6, 2021, includes both vulnerable \"front-line\" members from swing districts and safer veteran members who have roles on the Appropriations Committee. The latter legislators have long seen their efforts to pass budget bills interrupted by right-wing agitators in the Freedom Caucus, and they're not keen to see Jordan, one of the Freedom Caucus' founding leaders, benefit from the deposing of former Speaker and California Rep. Kevin McCarthy by other hard-liners.\n\nThe day did introduce a new subplot: behind-the-scenes discussion of a proposal by Ohio Rep. Dave Joyce to extend the tenure, and expand the powers, of temporary Speaker and North Carolina Rep. Patrick McHenry. (Specifically, Joyce's plan would make McHenry speaker until January.) As we discussed on Tuesday, while McHenry is a true-blue (true-red?) conservative, he's also seen by moderate Republicans and Democrats as someone who would be responsible enough to run the chamber without engaging in the kinds of disruptive stunts that Jordan has specialized in. It's within the realm of possibility that Republicans could agree to give the job to McHenry for the next few months (or that enough Democrats would support a motion to elevate him that it could pass even if hard-line right-wing Republicans opposed it).\n\nWhile Joyce is circulating this plan, though, it hasn't actually gotten put up for a vote. That's likely because any Republican who voted for McHenry right now would be perceived by his or her colleagues as undermining Jordan while his candidacy is still nominally alive.\n\nAnd it is! Nominally! Jordan still says he's hoping to become speaker. But none of the members who voted against him have given reporters an indication, on or off the record, that they might change their votes. (One of Jordan's supporters told Bloomberg that Jordan had tried to win the votes of several members of the New York delegation by offering to support an increase in the amount of the state and local deduction that individuals can take on their federal taxes but that his offer was rejected.) Jordan hasn't called for a third round of floor balloting on his candidacy, and a closed-door meeting of Republican representatives for which a room in the Capitol had been blocked off didn't take place, leading to an avant-garde NBC News update, titled \" House Republicans aren't meeting ,\" about the ... news? .... of a not-meeting:\n\nHouse Republicans had planned to hold a meeting when the chamber recessed earlier, but so far, the meeting room remains empty and there are no signs of a meeting.\n\nPer an official announcement , voting in the House on Thursday will begin \"no earlier than 12:00 p.m.\" The lower chamber of Congress has adopted the schedule of a teenager whose parents are about to make him get a summer job.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Slate's guide to the most important figures in politics this week.\n\nThanks once again for returning to read the Surge, Slate's beloved and influential newsletter about the most newsworthy political figures of the week. I'm filling in temporarily for Jim Newell, who climbed an apple tree in an effort to pick \"the fin'st fruits of autumne\" and has been stuck there for 16 days.\n\nThis week, we've got a non-RFK development in the charismatic spoiler candidate space, an Indiana congresswoman who loves to keep 'em guessing, and a heavily tranquilized Kraken being hauled off to the probation officer. But first, Jimmy J.\n\nBy Ben Mathis-Lilley\n\nLast week, Republican Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise ended his bid to become speaker of the House after receiving a collective response of \"What if we tried someone who had slightly fewer connections to David Duke \" from the moderate-ish wing of the chamber's GOP caucus. This week, it was Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan's turn to not get the job. In the first two rounds of floor balloting after becoming the leading speaker candidate, Jordan-a federal-spending hard-liner and 2020 \"Stop the Steal\" enthusiast -failed to top 200 votes. That's not very close to the 217 that he'd need to win, and the holdouts against him include both swing-district moderates and members of the Appropriations Committee who remember all the times Jordan screwed up their efforts to pass budgets. On Thursday, news broke that Jordan would be standing down in order to support a plan that extends the service of interim Speaker and North Carolina Rep. Patrick McHenry until January while giving him more authority to move legislation. But ... then news broke that Jordan wouldn't be doing that, and would seek a third round of balloting on Friday instead. When that ballot was held, though, he got even fewer votes than before-194, to be specific. Then he lost an internal caucus vote to determine whether he should remain the party's \"speaker designate.\" And with that, he was finally and officially done. We think.\n\nWith Jordan's candidacy flatlining, a large handful of other Republicans have said they're interested in competing for the job. Another option, alluded to above, is to put McHenry in charge for a few more months. Who's Patrick McHenry? Well, he's the kind of Republican who got elected to Congress at age 29 and wears a bow tie, aka an old-fashioned fiscal conservative. He was also an ally of California Rep. Kevin McCarthy and was said to be instrumental in helping McCarthy negotiate his way to the speakership in January. He also did not vote against certifying the 2020 election. His job, if elevated into a longer-term role, would be to persuade the Republican caucus to pass a bill to fund the government by Nov. 17 . That bill would need to respond to wars in the Middle East and Ukraine, and it would have to be acceptable to the White House and Senate. Would McHenry be able to succeed in doing that? I don't know-probably not, right? It doesn't seem like it. Does it seem like that to you? LOL. [ Deep sigh. ]\n\nThis week's more significant news, from the standpoint of direct human consequences, was the ongoing war between Israel and Hamas, and specifically a large and deadly explosion at a Gaza hospital that was initially blamed on Israel but may have in fact been caused by a rocket fired by the Islamic Jihad. It took place just before President Joe Biden's scheduled arrival in the Middle East , where he was expected to both reiterate the willingness of the U.S. to support Israel militarily and to meet with leaders of Arab states in an effort to prevent hostilities in the region from escalating. The latter meeting was canceled after the hospital explosion, but Biden did appear in Israel, delivering a public address that promised ongoing military assistance but also warned the country not to violate the laws of war or make the same kinds of vengeance-driven no-endgame mistakes that the U.S. made after 9/11. (He also said he would be supervising the delivery of $100 million in humanitarian aid to Gaza.) The balanced message is backed up by the leverage the U.S. yields as Israel's main military supplier, and as an economic partner to other countries in the region. But is any one entity powerful enough to prevent this conflict from getting even further out of control?\n\nOnce a legitimately accomplished young lawyer, Sidney Powell gradually became unmoored from reality after coming to believe that federal prosecutors had conspired against an Enron-related defendant she represented . By 2020, she had made her way into Donald Trump's orbit via right-wing media and, along with Rudy Giuliani, was instrumental in feeding him garbage \"evidence\" of election fraud and telling him that he had the ability to legally prevent Biden from becoming president. (She famously said she planned to \"release the Kraken\" by filing lawsuits to this end; they were all dismissed.) Thursday, she entered a guilty plea in Georgia to six misdemeanor charges of conspiring to interfere in the performance of election duties. (The charges were related to a scheme to obtain voter data in that state's Coffee County. On the one hand, Powell's story is a tragic one; on the other, it's a farce about trying to overturn a presidential election on the basis of testimony from someone who says she can time-travel and talk to the wind . And folks, that's the duality of modern American politics.\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell engaged this week in one of the more delightfully theatrical rituals of the American political process, suggesting via subtle verbal cues at a \" lunchtime address in New York City \" that the Fed's board of governors will not be raising interest rates at its upcoming meeting. (That two-day meeting begins on Oct. 31. Spooooooooky economics!) According to the Wall Street Journal, the address was interpreted this way because \"Powell twice used the word 'could' instead of the more muscular 'would' \" to describe the potential for further rate hikes, which have been made frequently in recent years in an effort to suppress inflation. The ostensible purpose of these kinds of foreshadowing signals is to keep investors from panicking in response to a big surprise; we're mentioning it here, though, because it's good news, very provisionally, for the Biden reelection campaign, given that it means that the Fed isn't expecting significant further inflation and, possibly, will be cutting interest rates next year in a way that makes the average American consumer and voter happy about their incumbent president. Or there could be a huge stock market crash next week. Who knows?\n\nThis week's House floor votes were more interesting than usual in that even party leaders didn't know how they'd go beforehand; Jim Jordan's allies, for instance, reportedly expected no more than 10 votes against him in the first round of speaker balloting, not the 20 that were entered. And no one's vote was less predictable than that of Muncie-area Indiana Rep. Victoria Spartz, a right-winger who has already announced her retirement from Congress despite this being only her second term. Before the first vote on Jordan, Spartz told reporters that she would vote for him if he were close to winning, but not if he were several votes short of winning, accompanying the position with a press release that said she was upset that Kevin McCarthy had urged Republicans to name Jordan as his successor because \"we fought a war not to have kings with successors.\" Fair enough? With Jordan clearly set to come up short on the first ballot, Spartz followed through and voted against him. Then, on the second and third ballots, with Jordan falling even shorter of winning, she voted for him. America, you just got Spartz'd.\n\nThe second-most-well-known left-leaning provocateur running for president as an independent candidate at the moment is professor and activist Cornel West , who was once seen by your correspondent and several acquaintances driving, by himself, on the New Jersey Turnpike in a gigantic black vintage Lincoln Town Car-style vehicle so enormous and perfectly suited to the aesthetic of his self-styling as a fiery old-school rabble-rouser/prophet that it made everyone present spontaneously laugh out loud. Anyway, this week, Federal Election Commission filings were made public that showed that West's campaign received the maximum allowable donation from Harlan Crow, the conservative multimillionaire who's been in the news for having given an overflowing cornucopia of undisclosed gifts to Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. West defended himself in a Thursday tweet in which he said that he has known \"brother Harlan Crow\" for years in a nonpolitical context, is happy to accept any donation that doesn't come from a PAC or corporate interest group, and prays for Crow's \"precious family.\" Then, on Friday- people changing their mind on Friday was a theme this week!-he announced that, \" as a jazzman ,\" he had listened to Crow's critics and would be returning the donation. In other words, this will probably not be the last time you read a novelty news item about Cornel West's presidential campaign.\n\nThe most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Jim Jordan Showed on His First Day How Unfit He Is To Lead the Judiciary Committee\n\nOn Wednesday, Rep. Jim Jordan, chair of the House Judiciary Committee, gaveled in the first hearing in what he promised will be a crusade against the Biden administration: \"We won't stop until we get the truth to fix the problem for the American people.\" The hearing-supposedly about the \" border crisis \"-had little to do with truth, though, instead going off on wild tangents, highlighting MAGA disinformation, and exploiting human suffering. That was to be expected given the record of the man who led it-one of obstructing investigations, spreading disinformation, and sowing false doubt in the minds of the American people. It confirmed what we knew going into the hearing: Jordan is unfit to serve on the Judiciary Committee, much less lead it.\n\nJordan is a classic demagogue. When presented with facts or evidence which plainly debunk his position, he doesn't concede or even attempt to further inquire into those truths. He instead seems content with pretending as though he was never presented with the truth at all, repeating his talking points incessantly without even acknowledging contradictory facts presented to him. This was seen most recently in an appearance on NBC's Meet the Press , during which Jordan just flat-out ignored his interlocutor, Chuck Todd. Under his leadership, the committee's aim to \"fix\" anything is a false premise, as Jordan has made clear he is out to get President Biden and his administration.\n\nJordan began Wednesday's opening hearing with the white nationalism-tinged argument that Biden is intentionally working to flood the nation with dangerous undocumented immigrants. \"Month after month after month, we have set records for migrants coming into the country, and frankly I think it's intentional,\" Jordan alleged . \"It seems deliberate, it seems premeditated, it seems intentional.\" This will be Jordan's mode of oversight from his Judiciary Committee perch, lobbing unfounded allegations. \"Make no mistake about it, the Biden administration is carrying out its plan,\" he alleged on Wednesday, saying that \"crimes committed by illegal alien trespassers and ... overwhelmed local resources ... are all part of [the] federal government's plan.\" Again, this is not oversight, it is demagoguery.\n\nJordan, in fact, is a classic example of a member of Congress who has demonstrated contempt for congressional oversight-except when he wants to abuse it for partisan purposes. That is clear from Jordan's refusal to cooperate with the Jan. 6 House Select Committee's investigations and, indeed, his own participation in the Trump-led attempted coup on the peaceful transition of power following the 2020 election.\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee's final report describes Jordan as \"a significant player\" in Trump's efforts to illegally overturn the 2020 election results. The evidence presented by the committee in their report lays bare how Jordan was \"personally involved in the acts and circumstances of January 6th\" and why he, along with a handful of other members, \"should be questioned in a public forum about their advance knowledge of and role in President Trump's plan to prevent the peaceful transition of power.\"\n\nJordan, who wants to subpoena and question witnesses in his congressional investigations, himself ignored a congressional subpoena and flat-out refused to be questioned in a congressional investigation about the blatant attacks on our democracy.\n\nJordan has yet to account publicly for his involvement-he twice failed to appear for deposition testimony before the committee, instead responding via a series of letters setting out a \"variety of objections.\" In one such letter, Jordan contended that the committee's request for him to appear was \"outside the bounds of any legitimate inquiry, violates core Constitutional principles, and would serve to further erode legislative norms.\" This was untrue and represented a series of false excuses to avoid accountability for his actions.\n\nAppearing in response to the request for his testimony would have been the proper action, an action he refused to take , but no doubt expects others to undertake in the hearings he calls.\n\nBeyond his refusal to testify about his own involvement in Jan. 6, Jordan's general views and actions promote falsehoods and encourage attacks on legitimate institutions. As others have written, Jordan engaged in \" a systematic disinformation campaign \" of falsehoods about the election processes and institutions he vowed to protect; he was involved in \"early post-election messaging strategy\" and \"participated in numerous post-election meetings in which senior White House officials, Rudolph Giuliani, and others, discussed strategies for challenging the election, chief among them claims that the election had been tainted by fraud\"; and he advocated that state legislatures could appoint their own electors, fake electors, a legal theory in contravention of the Constitution and the Electoral Count Act.\n\nBut his actions intent on stymieing the transition of power on Jan. 6 were even more sinister. As early as November 2020, Jordan had been having discussions with White House officials about Vice President Mike Pence's role on Jan. 6. Jordan, along with other Republican members of Congress from the Freedom Caucus, attended a White House meeting on Dec. 21, 2020, in which the plan to have Pence \"affect the outcome of the election was disclosed and discussed,\" according to the committee report. But Jordan's involvement went further than merely attending meetings. He led them.\n\nOn Jan. 2, 2021, Jordan led a conference call with Trump and other members of Congress where the group \"discussed strategies for delaying the January 6th joint session.\" The group also \"discussed issuing social media posts encouraging President Trump's supporters to 'march to the Capitol' on the 6th.\" These events involved nothing less than an effort to steal a presidential election for the first time in our history and helped lead to the insurrectionist attack on the Capitol.\n\nJordan's communication with Trump and the White House endured right up until at least the evening of Jan. 6. Jordan himself has acknowledged that he forwarded a message to White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows on Jan. 5 , advising that Pence should \"call out all the electoral votes that he believes are unconstitutional as no electoral votes at all.\" He has also admitted that he spoke to Trump \"more than once\" on Jan. 6, though he has provided inconsistent public statements on the exact number of conversations and has been less forthcoming on what the two spoke about. The Jan. 6 committee report also states that Jordan spoke at least twice with Rudy Giuliani on the evening of Jan 6, prior to the joint session resuming. Details of those conversations remain unknown, but \"during that time, Giuliani has testified, he was attempting to reach Members of Congress after the joint session resumed to encourage them to continue objecting to Joe Biden's electoral votes.\"\n\nAllegations about Jordan's involvement in coverups are not new. Jordan served as an assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University from 1986 to 199 4 at a time when the team physician for OSU athletes was engaged in widespread sexual abuse of OSU student-athletes. An independent OSU investigation released in 2019 found that the physician, Richard Strauss, had sexually abused at least 177 male students during his 20-year tenure as an athletic and student health doctor at OSU.\n\nThe OSU report found that 22 coaches confirmed to investigators that they were aware of rumors and/or complaints about Strauss . Several former OSU wrestlers said in on-the-record interviews and in testimony before the Ohio statehouse in 2020 that they had either directly talked to Jordan about the situation or that he should have known about it as it was an \"open secret\" on the team. In 2019, a former wrestling referee said he reported sexual misconduct involving Strauss directly to Jordan.\n\nJordan called accusations that he helped cover up sexual abuse \"false,\" saying: \"I never knew about any type of abuse.\" Jordan accused one of the wrestlers of having a \"vendetta\" and, in a 2018 interview with Fox News, suggested the \"lies\" were \"sequenced and choreographed\" by \"the left.\" It's all part of the Jordan playbook in his congressional role as well: Deflect, distract, and distort reality.\n\nJordan as a self-professed truth-seeker is an oxymoron, given the Ohio State allegation, his stonewalling of the congressional investigation into Trump's attempted coup and the attack on the Capitol, and his refusal to comply with a congressional subpoena from the committee.\n\nUnfortunately, Jordan is not only chairing the House Judiciary Committee. As part of his alleged quest to \"get the truth,\" he is also chairing a new subcommittee, named the Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government. This new committee shows every sign of preparing to abuse congressional powers in order to undertake partisan attacks on the Biden administration, intelligence agencies, and law enforcement bodies.\n\nIt is Jordan's responsibility to come fully clean about himself, including his active participation in the greatest attack on our democracy since the Civil War. Until he does, the last thing he should be doing is investigating anyone else.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Should a Conspiracy Theory Bonehead Be Speaker of the House?\n\nUpdate, Oct. 17, 2023, at 2:15 p.m.: Twenty Republicans voted against Jim Jordan in Tuesday's effort to select a new speaker of the House. Because one Republican member was absent, that left Jordan 17 votes short of winning the position, with about double the number of votes against him that congressional reporters (and at least one of Jordan's allies) had anticipated . The House is now in recess, and it's unclear whether there will be another speaker vote today; presumably, Jordan would push for one only if he believed he could come closer to 217 on a second attempt. The situation is, as they say, fluid.\n\nOhio Rep. Jim Jordan's main interest as a public servant is pursuing the theory that there is a \"deep state\" conspiracy involving the government, major technology companies, etc., to suppress right-wing speech, frame Donald Trump for crimes, and protect Hunter Biden . This summer, to give you a sense of his priorities, he hosted Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for a hearing so that Kennedy could complain at length that his anti-vaccine beliefs have been censored. Jordan was also big into stolen-election gobbledygook and was a central figure in the plan to contest the Electoral College count on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nIn short, Jordan specializes in the kinds of subjects that reliably function as a sort of magical dial that can turn down the share of independent and swing-voter support that Republicans receive in a given election. (The effect of overfocusing on MAGA issues has been demonstrated, like, dozens of times, but for one recent instance, look at this new study of \"pivot voters\" and search for the parts about Trump and Jan. 6.) Traditionally, he's been seen as an albatross around the necks of Republicans from swing districts because he pressured party leaders into holding floor votes on right-wing causes that the vulnerable members didn't want to have to register a position on. If they voted against Jordan, right-wing media would come after them and they might lose a primary election; if they voted for him, they might lose their general election.\n\nFunny story: That's the same decision that these center-leaning representatives are now faced with dealing with, in perpetuity, as they decide whether to vote Jim Jordan into office as speaker of the House.\n\nTo recap, after California Rep. Kevin McCarthy was deposed from the speakership by hard-liners for making a government-funding deal with the White House, Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise-McCarthy's longtime frenemy in House leadership-beat out Jordan in an internal GOP vote to determine who should be the party's next speaker nominee. But Scalise ultimately couldn't get enough support to win over a full 217 members of the 221-member caucus, which is what he would have had to do to actually be selected speaker, in part because moderates were skeeved out that he is infamous for having once attended a conference for white supremacists.\n\nSomehow, this resulted in Jordan, whose connections to various far-right groups and their recent attempt to overthrow the government are even more robust than Scalise's, ending up with more widespread support in the caucus than Scalise had. Early this week, as the House prepared to open its floor back up for business on Tuesday at noon, it looked as if Jordan was going to win over vulnerable Republicans simply by promising not to do the kind of things he has spent his career doing, like forcing hot-potato votes and engineering government shutdowns. Literally, the pitch was just saying he wasn't going to do that stuff anymore:\n\nBeyond sheer bitterness over how this all was engineered, Rs mainly fear that Jordan has never shown a propensity to protect or grow a majority, and if anything his impulses have run counter to such efforts. Whether you believe him or not, he has been saying all the right things.\n\nOn Monday night, though, Jordan's momentum stalled as roughly eight to 10 members signaled that they still aren't ready to come around on him. Their objections were perhaps best summed up by Colorado Rep. Ken Buck, who said he's not going to vote for someone who won't admit that Donald Trump lost the last election .\n\nSo, what's gonna happen when voting starts, which is now expected to be at about 1 p.m.? Nobody knows, and that's what makes it so \"fun\"! Republican Texas Rep. and Jordan ally Chip Roy says he thinks Jordan will fall short in the first vote, after which he'll try to meet with holdouts to see if he can win them over. On the Democrats' side, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries is floating the idea of a compromise plan to elevate North Carolina Rep. Patrick McHenry, who is serving as temporary speaker, to the permanent role.* McHenry, while conservative, is known for being interested in the actual workings of government in a way that Jordan is not, and voted to certify Biden's victory in 2021. So far, though, no actual Republicans have said they would participate in that plan.\n\nThere's also Indiana Rep. Victoria Spartz, a nominally hard-line conservative who says-and while we realize that this is confusing, it's what she said -she is happy to be the 217 th (i.e., winning) vote for Jordan but will not be the 211 th vote for him if he has only 210, and that this is happening because Jordan has used \" McCarthy intimidation techniques \" in his efforts to build a winning coalition.\n\nAs always, it's a rich tapestry that adorns the halls of our democracy!\n\nCorrection, Oct. 17, 2023: This article originally misstated that Patrick McHenry is a Virginia representative. He represents North Carolina.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC. All rights reserved."

      "text": "Real Church Committee Advises Jim Jordan's \"New Church Committee\" to Change Course\n\nRep. Jim Jordan is one of the most powerful members of Congress. He chairs both the House Judiciary Committee and its new subcommittee on the \"Weaponization of the Federal Government.\" House Republicans have declared that Jordan's investigations are \"modeled\" after the \"Church Committee,\" the famed 1975-76 Select Committee on Intelligence Activities created after a series of scandals involving the CIA.\n\nOn Wednesday, a bipartisan group of 28 distinguished, former government officials who staffed the Church Committee wrote a letter describing how Jordan might be able to replicate that committee's success, if that were his actual aim. Based on the subcommittee's embarrassing first meeting on February 9, however, and Jordan's statements and actions, it's clear that he has no such intent. Indeed, the letter from those former Church Committee members elucidates the degree to which the Republican labeling campaign is a pathetic branding exercise.\n\nOn Wednesday, Jordan issued his latest slew of subpoenas, this set going to CEOs of five Big Tech companies from Alphabet to Microsoft. The new subpoenas reaffirmed that he's on a wholly partisan crusade to prove his crackpot theories that the Biden administration and the FBI censored pro-Trump messages and trampled on the First Amendment rights of conservatives. This is nothing like what the Church Committee sought to achieve.\n\nThe Church Committee letter signers are quite remarkable in their backgrounds, breadth, and experience. They include former holders of a long list of important government positions .\n\nThe committee they staffed was one of the most effective investigative enterprises in Congressional history. It produced recommendations that turned into historic reforms in American law enforcement and intelligence systems. Those reforms included the creation, among other things, of a permanent Congressional intelligence oversight committee and FISA, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.\n\nIn contrast to the Church Committee's productive foundation, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy got the Weaponization Subcommittee off on the wrong foot. While the Church Committee was launched with an 82-4 bipartisan Senate vote in January 1975, McCarthy proceeded on a purely partisan-line vote, with 221 Republicans voting to approve the committee and 211 Democrats voting against it as a partisan sham.\n\nAs the authors of the letter note, the subjects of the investigation were also bipartisan, spanning multiple past Democratic and Republican presidential administrations. The Church Committee \"criticized certain intelligence activities as imprudent or improper under both Democratic and Republican presidents.\" This already is not the case with the Jordan committee, which feels more like a Donald Trump protection racket.\n\nThe Church Committee's bipartisan origins facilitated the cooperative two-party operation which was the gateway to its success. Its staffers' letter lays out how its achievements were a function of collaborative leadership: \"As chair, Frank Church worked closely ... with fellow Democrats [and] with the panel's Republicans.\" As a result, Republicans and Democrats alike \"strongly supported the Committee's essential investigative mission.\"\n\nIn the same vein, the Church committee \"[m]ajority counsel routinely included minority counsel in witness interviews and ... deposition[s].\" In another sharp variance, Republicans have played their cards so close to the vest that last Thursday, at the subcommittee's inaugural meeting, freshman Rep. Dan Goldman, a former prosecutor, was left to question Jordan on whether there were notes of interviews with \"whistleblowers\" whom Jordan said he intends to call. Jordan would not promise to share any such notes with his minority colleagues.\n\nCritically, the Church Committee staffers note in their letter, \"the Church Committee pledged not to interfere with active law enforcement matters or ongoing, lawful intelligence operations.\" Jordan would make no such promise , telling CBS News that he could not preclude the possibility that a focus of the weaponization committee would be to investigate or short-circuit a \"specific ongoing criminal investigation.\" Jordan has said elsewhere he would be using his newfound powers to look into the ongoing classified documents investigations involving President Joe Biden and former President Trump.\n\nThe veterans of the Church committee describe another one of its crucial features: \"All Committee members publicly committed to ensuring that ... intelligence activities are conducted within America's legal framework.\" In any organization, that kind of shared central mission is a springboard to success. The Jordan committee already looks different. \"On the Church Committee, there was broad agreement that these things ought to be looked at and, in the end, there was broad agreement on what we might do about them,\" former Democratic Church Committee staffer Gregory F. Treverton told the New York Times. \"In this case, there's no broad agreement on what ought to be looked at.\"\n\nThe signs that there was no such shared mission abounded at the weaponization subcommittee's first meeting. As NBC reported , \"The partisan hearing largely consisted of Democrats and Republicans asking friendly witnesses favorable questions that reinforced their views.\"\n\nFor instance, the Republicans' keynote witness, Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, spent his time accusing Hillary Clinton of colluding with the Russians in her 2016 presidential election defeat at the hands of Donald Trump. Republican witness Tulsi Gabbard, once a Democratic Congresswoman and now a Fox News contributor, spent her time airing complaints about Clinton having criticized Gabbard during her 2020 run for president.\n\nWe're not talking bipartisan national purpose here, folks. We're talking grade B personal grievance politics.\n\nRanking minority subcommittee member Stacey Plaskett bluntly captured the contrast with the Church committee when she expressed concern that the subcommittee was being used as \"a place to settle scores, showcase conspiracy theories and advance an extreme agenda that risks undermining Americans' faith in our democracy.\"\n\nThe Church veterans' letter suggests that Jordan's committee look into the reporting of actual weaponization of the Justice Department under former Attorney General William Barr and his special counsel, John Durham, who spent time and taxpayers' money chasing invisible \"conspirators\" against Donald Trump in the FBI and Democratic party. Durham was effectively \" laughed out of court \" when both individuals whom he targeted for trial were acquitted last year.\n\nUnfortunately, Jordan looking into actual \"weaponization\" by his own party is as likely as Donald Trump apologizing to Hillary Clinton for the Republican witnesses making such a big deal about her before the Weaponization subcommittee. The best we can hope for with Jordan and his crew is that the Democrats will continue tying them up with their own rope.\n\nIt's useful when a distinguished group of seasoned veterans of the committee which today's Republicans claim to be emulating present them with the true lens of history. Their letter shows how far Jordan and his party colleagues have strayed from the search for truth and, indeed, their lack of interest in finding it.\n\nThe Church Committee was Congress at its finest. The Jordan Committee is Congress at its lowest.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Whom Has Jim Jordan Targeted in His Subpoena Spree?\n\nRepublican Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan has been busy since he became chairman of the House Judiciary Committee in January. Under the banner of investigating whether the government is unfairly targeting and silencing conservatives , he's been issuing subpoenas to a host of top officials across the White House and beyond. One of them recently backfired: Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg is suing Jordan over a subpoena he issued to a former assistant DA.\n\nThe lawsuit argues that Jordan is interfering with Bragg's investigation into Donald Trump, since Jordan subpoenaed Mark Pomerantz, the man who formerly led the DA's investigation into Trump and wrote a book about the experience.\n\nJordan's spree has been fueled by a key concession that his fellow far-right Republicans won from House Speaker Kevin McCarthy at the start of the 118th Congress: the formation of a new subcommittee on the weaponization of the federal government.\n\nSince it falls under the Judiciary committee, the weaponization subcommittee has the power to investigate the executive branch, including ongoing criminal investigations-allowing Jordan, one of the loudest firebrands in the GOP, to subpoena some of the White House's biggest figures. (Ironically, Jordan himself ignored a congressional subpoena he received from the House Jan. 6 committee.)\n\nSince the subcommittee's inaugural hearing in February, it's launched investigations into how the DOJ handled efforts to address violent threats against school board members and how the Federal Trade Commission worked with Twitter to suppress ring-wing viewpoints on the platform.\n\nIt hasn't produced much in the way of evidence so far , and seems to be using hearings to regurgitate conspiracy theories-Hunter Biden's laptop, FBI misconduct towards Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton's emails (sigh). At one point, the subcommittee's top Democrat, Rep. Stacey Plaskett, accused Jordan of \"weaponizing Congress\" and simply using it to settle scores.\n\nJust over 100 days into the 118th Congress, what have they been up to? Mostly interviewing members of the Biden Administration on issues that amplify the far-right's agenda. Here are some of the biggest names Jordan has demanded to talk to:\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland\n\nGarland appeared before the subcommittee to discuss a memo the DOJ issued in 2021, a time when COVID-19 measures and fights about what to include in school curricula were leading to confrontations at school board meetings.\n\nThe National School Board Association wrote to President Joe Biden asking the DOJ to help protect school board members and educators they believed were \"susceptible to acts of violence.\" The letter equated the attacks on school officials to \"domestic terrorism and hate crimes.\" In response, the DOJ directed federal and state law enforcement to work together to address the threats.\n\nThe NSBA eventually walked back its letter, apologizing for \"some of the language\" included.\n\nBut Jordan holds up this now-withdrawn memo as a Biden administration attempt to label parents voicing their concerns as domestic terrorists-claims Garland roundly denied. \"I did not issue any memorandum directing the investigation of parents who are concerned about their children,\" he told the committee .\n\nSecretary of Education Miguel Cardona\n\nJordan subpoenaed Cardona as part of the same investigation of the DOJ's involvement with local school boards. The subcommittee alleged that the secretary solicited the memo from the National School Boards Association. (Cardona's spokeswoman told the Washington Post that did not happen.)\n\nFormer NSBA Execs Chip Slaven & Viola Garcia\n\nJordan's subcommittee claims that Slaven and Garcia \"directed the FBI to establish a 'threat tag' to investigate Americans.\" That's because Slaven was interim executive director of NSBA at the time and was responsible for sending Biden the letter requesting support for school officials and board members. Garcia co-signed the letter as NSBA's president and a member of a Texas school board.\n\nFormer Department of Homeland Security Executive Nina Jankowicz\n\nJankowicz is the former executive director of the DHS's now-disbanded Disinformation Governance Board, which was tasked with developing recommendations to stop the flow of disinformation by China, Russia and violent domestic extremists.\n\nThe subcommittee argues she played a role in censoring conservatives, which she pushed back on by saying on Twitter it was a \"working group meant to address disinformation that endangered Americans' safety.\"\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray\n\nJordan wants Wray to answer questions about the FBI's efforts to investigate white supremacists' interactions with Catholic churches in Richmond, Virginia. Jordan accused the agency of undertaking \"domestic violent extremism investigations against Catholic Americans.\"\n\nThe inquiry is inspired by an internal memo leaked by former FBI agent Kyle Seraphin, detailing a plan to monitor what the agency believed was a \"growing overlap\" between \"radical-traditionalist Catholics\" and the far-right white nationalist movement. The memo also included a list of Catholic organizations flagged as hate groups. Upon learning about the memo's existence, the FBI confirmed it was taken down from its system and a review of the document was initiated. Wray said that the FBI doesn't target people over their religious beliefs.\n\nFTC Chair Lina Khan\n\nJordan wants Khan to appear before the subcommittee to discuss the FTC's probe into Twitter after Elon Musk took over the company. Jordan alleges that the FTC \"harassed Twitter in the wake of Mr. Musk's acquisition\" and made \"inappropriate and burdensome\" demands of the social media company.\n\nKhan has said that FTC investigations are confidential and that her agency \"will continue to faithfully discharge our statutory obligations and enforce the law without fear or favor.\"\n\nSo how have these conversations been going so far?

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nBut he's going to keep trying to flip GOP holdouts.\n\nby Andrew Prokop\n\nSpeaker Jim Jordan. The phrase would have long been unthinkable, even laughable, to most Republicans in the House of Representatives.\n\nBut though he's long been considered a firebrand, an attack dog, and even a \"legislative terrorist\" (per former Speaker John Boehner ), Jordan was the GOP's nominee when the House of Representatives voted on a speaker this week.\n\nYet Jordan's bid has hit a snag. In two rounds of balloting so far on the House floor, holdout Republicans have prevented him from getting the votes he needs. That means, for now, that the House is still speakerless.\n\nJordan is expected to try again, though. He likely hopes that through some combination of pressure and dealmaking, the GOP resistance to his speakership will crumble.\n\nTo understand why a Jordan speakership would be so significant - and is proving so controversial - it's worth understanding just who Jordan is.\n\nPrevious Republican speakers - Boehner, Paul Ryan, and Kevin McCarthy - were conservatives who accommodated their conference's right flank in various ways. But Jordan is of the hard right. He's a staunch Donald Trump ally and was a collaborator in Trump's effort to overturn President Joe Biden 's 2020 election victory - he privately advised the White House that Vice President Mike Pence should throw out electoral votes from states Biden won.\n\nJordan's cultivation of the right helped him rise to power in the GOP conference, often at the expense of previous leaders like Boehner, and helped him survive a scandal that threatened to derail his career in 2018. Jordan then made somewhat of a turn, building an alliance with McCarthy - just as the House GOP establishment embraced the hard right more tightly and moved further in Jordan's direction.\n\nIf Jordan wins the speakership, it would become unmistakably clear that the right-wing hardliners who've had increasing influence in the House GOP are now in charge of the conference. That is one reason some Republicans are holding back their support for him on the floor. The holdouts include several members from districts Joe Biden won in 2020, and several more who serve on the powerful Appropriations Committee and may distrust Jordan on government funding issues.\n\nBack in January, McCarthy managed to grind out a victory over four days and 15 rounds of balloting. Now Jordan will get his chance to see if he can do the same.\n\nIf he can win the speakership, Jordan's most pressing near-term task will be averting a government shutdown set to begin in just one month. He'll also have to work out longer-term government funding deals, and decide how to deal with investigations and the impeachment inquiry into President Biden, all while trying to help the House GOP keep its majority in 2024.\n\nIn doing all this, he'll face many of the same pressures and incentives as McCarthy and his other predecessors did. But Jordan could paradoxically find it easier to cut deals with Democrats, since he has deep wells of trust and credibility on the right, and may be less blamed for selling out. Of course, whether Jordan would want to cut deals is a question of its own. Would he be changed by the institution of the speaker's office, or is it too hard to teach an old attack dog new tricks?\n\nJordan's playbook throughout his career has been to make himself the champion of the right, always eager to attack Democrats with bare-knuckle partisan warfare, and often willing to denounce GOP establishment leaders as feckless and weak-willed.\n\nFirst elected to the House of Representatives in 2006 after a 12-year stint in Ohio's state legislature, Jordan gained little national notice until the Tea Party wave of 2010. When the new majority took office in 2011. Jordan had already risen to become chair of the Republican Study Committee, a group of House conservatives. By 2015, he'd concluded that body wasn't extreme enough, and co-founded the House Freedom Caucus to try and even more aggressively challenge GOP leaders. The group's hardline stances consistently frustrated party leaders in the ensuing years.\n\nIn the fights over spending and the debt ceiling that ran through President Obama and Speaker Boehner's tenures, Jordan was a leading proponent of hardball tactics, frequently excoriating his own party's leadership for purportedly not being tough enough, as well as embarrassing them by rejecting deals they'd negotiated with Democrats. By July 2011, reporters were already asking whether it was Jordan, not Boehner, who was the most powerful House Republican.\n\n\"To Boehner and his allies, Jordan was the antagonist in the story of his speakership - an embodiment of the brinkmanship and betrayal that roiled the House Republican majority and made Boehner's life miserable,\" Tim Alberta wrote in Politico Magazine in 2017.\n\nMeanwhile, Jordan also built up his reputation as a partisan attack dog and a conservative media favorite with his work on investigations. During the Obama administration, he snarled out contemptuous questions to officials involved in the various purported scandals Fox and other media outlets were hyping. Then, when Trump took office, Jordan used subpoena power and the bully pulpit to try to discredit any investigations into misconduct by the president. This is now typical House Republican behavior, but at the time it stood out - Jordan was among a small group of lawmakers willing to aggressively challenge special counsel Robert Mueller's probe early.\n\nYet as Jordan was attaining new prominence as a Trump ally, a scandal broke out that imperiled his career.\n\nWhen Jordan was in college, he was a star wrestler at Ohio State University. After graduation, from 1987 until 1995, he was an assistant coach for OSU's wrestling program. During that period, OSU's athletics department employed a doctor named Richard Strauss who, a law firm retained by OSU in 2019 concluded, \"sexually abused at least 177 male student-patients he was charged with treating as a University physician.\" Strauss was the wrestling team's doctor and many of his victims were wrestlers.\n\nStrauss died in 2005, but the accusations against him were first publicly reported in 2018 . Former OSU wrestlers told reporters that Strauss's conduct was \"an open secret in the athletics department.\" And some pointed the finger at Jordan specifically - arguing that he knew about Strauss's abuse and did nothing to stop it. Six former wrestlers told CNN that they were present when complaints about Strauss were made to Jordan.\n\nJordan worked feverishly to try and rebut the accusations. One former wrestler, Adam DiSabato, testified to the Ohio state legislature that Jordan called and urged him to rebut his brother's claims that Jordan knew about Strauss's conduct. \"Jim Jordan called me crying, crying. Groveling. On the 4th of July, begging me to go against my brother,\" DiSabato told Ohio legislators. \"Begging me. Crying for a half hour. That's the kind of cover-ups that's going on there.\"\n\nA Jordan spokesperson told CNN that DiSabato's claim was a \"lie.\" His office's standard response to these claims has been the statement: \"Congressman Jordan never saw or heard of any abuse, and if he had he would have dealt with it.\" (One former OSU wrestler told NBC News that was \"playing with words,\" adding, \"None of us used the words 'sexual abuse' when we talked about what Doc Strauss was doing to us, we just knew it was weird and Jimmy knew about it because we talked about it all the time in the locker room, at practices, everywhere.\")\n\nIn the end, conservatives and the Republican Party backed Jordan, the news cycle moved on, and he kept his seat and positions in the House. He may be derisively nicknamed \"Gym Jordan\" by liberals on social media, but the scandal did not dislodge his rise to power. Jordan was the right's champion, so the right stuck with him.\n\nThe story of Jordan's rise to the top of House GOP politics is in part a story of changes in the party and in part a story of changes in Jordan's own approach.\n\nJordan made a play at leading the House GOP once before, in November 2018. Republicans had just lost the House and Ryan was retiring, so the GOP had to elect a new minority leader. Jordan threw his hat in the ring against Ryan's number two, Kevin McCarthy. But McCarthy won easily , in a 159 to 43 vote. Jordan wasn't even close.\n\nIt was then, per reporting by Politico's Olivia Beavers , that McCarthy offered Jordan a choice. If Jordan wanted the top GOP slot on the House Oversight Committee, he had to stop undercutting party leaders and stop causing chaos in the GOP conference. Jordan agreed. He led Republicans on the Oversight Committee and then, when it opened up in 2020, the House Judiciary Committee. He didn't totally change his ways - he was still a partisan attack dog - but he was more of a team player and developed a good working relationship with McCarthy.\n\nMcCarthy and the House GOP, meanwhile, embraced the partisan logic of being all-out defenders of Donald Trump - even when Trump tried to do outrageous things, like overturning Joe Biden's 2020 election victory.\n\nJordan himself was in regular contact with the White House (his former House Freedom Caucus co-founder Mark Meadows was then chief of staff) as Trump's effort unfolded. \"Jim Jordan knew more about what Donald Trump had planned for January 6th than any other member of the House of Representatives,\" former Rep. Liz Cheney said this month .\n\nIn public, Jordan implied the election was stolen; in private, he texted Meadows suggesting that Pence should throw out Biden's electoral votes in swing states. Like McCarthy, he voted to throw out Biden's wins in Arizona and Pennsylvania. And after the January 6 attacks, he quickly returned to his usual partisan rancor. McCarthy and most of the House GOP did the same, as critics of Donald Trump retired or lost their seats in primaries.\n\nThen, this year, when McCarthy came under pressure, Jordan stuck by him. In the 4-day, 15-ballot speaker election in January, Jordan stood with McCarthy rather than seeking to challenge him again. When McCarthy cut a deal with President Biden to raise the debt ceiling - a deal the old Jordan would have worked tirelessly to scuttle - Jordan endorsed it . When McCarthy was finally deposed by just eight defecting Republicans (joining with Democrats), Jordan's fingerprints weren't on the effort.\n\nScalise, McCarthy's number two, was next in line. But the deposed speaker sounded notably warmer toward the prospect of Jordan succeeding him than Scalise, with whom he'd had a fraught relationship . Scalise prevailed in the initial internal party vote last week, but privately, Jordan didn't sound ready to give up. He said he'd back Scalise on the House floor, but reportedly told him, \" America wants me .\" And when hardline Republicans said they'd oppose Scalise, Jordan didn't seem to be working too hard to win them over.\n\nBut unlike Scalise, who said he wouldn't cut any side deals to make himself speaker, and then threw in the towel after barely more than 24 hours of effort, Jordan has spent the past few days trying to win over his doubters in the GOP conference. Defense hawks and appropriators disliked Jordan's history of supporting defense cuts, but he reassured them. There are reports that he may have cut a deal to allow Ukraine aid - opposed by many on the right, but supported by Democrats and a faction of House Republicans - to a vote.\n\nThese efforts have not, however, been enough to win him the speakership just yet.\n\nInevitably, Speaker Jordan would have to disappoint some Republicans. He'll face the same implacable challenges that confronted Kevin McCarthy before him.\n\nThe demands of the various factions within the GOP conference are incompatible. Some are willing to cut deals with Democrats to fund the government in a business-as-usual way; some want transformational spending cuts and fantasize that those can be achieved with hardball negotiating. Swing district members might prefer the party not embrace Trump so wholeheartedly, but the majority of the conference has gotten accustomed to doing just that.\n\nIf Jordan wins, for the rest of 2023 and 2024, one question is whether he would bring us a new round of congressional crises over government spending bills - or whether he could actually get the right to chill a bit.\n\nTheoretically, Jordan could see his speakership as the ultimate chance to prove that he was right back in those battles with Boehner - that, with more guts and grit, the GOP could have forced Democrats to concede a whole lot more. If he chooses that path, things could get very messy on the road to 2024.\n\nBut remember, Jordan hasn't sounded so eager to push big spending showdowns this year. He could well calculate that his legislative impact will be sharply limited so long as Democrats hold the presidency and the Senate - so he could instead devote his efforts to ensuring Republicans win in 2024, in hopes of passing sweeping bills under unified GOP rule in 2025. Jordan has never had to cater to swing district members, who generally hate government shutdowns, before, but if he wants to hold onto or expand his majority, he'll have to do that.\n\nAn election-focused Jordan would not mean a kinder, gentler Jordan. He has long perfected the art of using congressional powers as partisan weapons, and he will surely redouble efforts to unearth any negative information he can about the Biden family, to better hurt Biden's reelection. Partisan warfare is certain under Speaker Jordan; the question is which specific battles he will choose.\n\nThe real consequences of Jordan's victory may play out if Trump wins in 2024 and returns to the presidency. Jordan has a track record of backing every authoritarian and anti-democratic move Trump makes. If Trump plans any further power grabs, Jim Jordan is exactly who he'd want to have running the House.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nJordan got the GOP nomination. But he's a long way from the support he needs on the House floor.\n\nby Andrew Prokop\n\nIf at first you don't succeed, get the guy who succeeded to quit, and then try again.\n\nThat's how Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) won a vote among House Republicans to be the party's newest nominee for speaker of the House Friday.\n\nBut that's only step one. To become speaker, Jordan will need to win a majority on the floor of the House of Representatives. Since Democrats are certain to unanimously oppose him, that means he'd need 217 of 221 Republicans to clinch the job, if everyone is in attendance.\n\nAnd he's still a long, long way from that. After winning the GOP nomination, Jordan asked for another vote among House Republicans about whether they'd support his speaker election on the floor. Only 152 said they would.\n\nIf the holdouts are serious, the GOP has no clear path forward.\n\nJordan is now facing the same problem Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA), who narrowly defeated Jordan in the party's initial speaker nominee vote two days prior, faced. On Thursday night, Scalise threw in the towel, evidently concluding he could not unite the party.\n\nJordan then eagerly jumped back into the race. In Friday's vote, he beat back a late challenge from Rep. Austin Scott (R-GA), a little-known lawmaker, 124 to 81 - a margin only slightly better than Scalise's . But that triumph was undercut by the vote shortly afterward that made clear how far he still had to go.\n\nStill, if Jordan tries to fight it out, the dynamic will be different. He'll have hardliners on the right - who've previously caused trouble on the floor votes - solidly behind him. Holdouts will also face pressure from right-wing media outlets and likely President Trump .\n\nJordan has long been a leader in the hardline faction of the GOP conference - former speaker John Boehner once called him a \"legislative terrorist.\" Yet in recent years he's appeared to be a team player working with leadership; for instance, he backed McCarthy's debt ceiling deal this year.\n\nBut there is resentment among some in the GOP conference about the tactics Jordan and his backers have used to climb to the top. Others may be concerned that Jordan's leadership would be too extreme.\n\nCurrently, Republicans plan to put Jordan's nomination on the floor on Tuesday. So the next few days will determine whether there are enough \"Never Jordan\" Republicans to block him - or whether his critics will cave and vote him in.\n\nAfter McCarthy's deposal as speaker, Jordan and Scalise soon emerged as the two leading candidates to replace him. And in the party's first attempt at picking a speaker nominee, on Wednesday, Scalise narrowly defeated Jordan in a 113 to 99 internal party vote.\n\nReports at the time were that Jordan conceded and pledged to endorse Scalise afterward. Now, however, sources have told Politico that he was not so conciliatory. According to Rep. Ann Wagner (R-MO), who wasn't in the room but says she was told what happened, Jordan told Scalise: \"You get one ballot. And when you go down, you will nominate me.\" Then, when Scalise protested, Jordan said, \"America wants me\" and walked out.\n\nScalise would not even make it to that first ballot on the House floor. From Wednesday afternoon to Thursday, 19 Republicans, mostly hardliners on the right and Jordan allies, said they would not support Scalise's nomination on the floor. So on Thursday night, Scalise threw in the towel and quit the race .\n\nJordan then made it official that he'd try again, and as Republicans prepared for another internal speaker vote Friday, he was the only declared candidate.\n\nBut shortly after noon, Scott announced he was throwing his name in the ring. The little-known lawmaker didn't really come off as a serious contender - he openly said \"I don't necessarily want to be the speaker of the House\" - but he provided an alternative that the anti-Jordan contingent could back.\n\nThen, before the GOP even voted, allies of two other members - Majority Whip Tom Emmer (R-MN) and Rep. Mike Johnson (R-LA) - told reporters that, if Jordan just so happened to fail to get 217 votes on the floor, they'd be interested in being considered. You know, just in case.\n\nJordan ended up with 124 votes on the secret ballot GOP vote - not an incredibly impressive showing against his little-known challenger. Then just 152 Republicans said they'd support him on the floor - meaning he needs 65 more.\n\nIt's a tall order.

Now the party is searching for new speaker candidates.\n\nby Andrew Prokop\n\nRepublicans' search for a new speaker of the House has gone back to square one.\n\nAfter Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) fell short of the votes he needed on the House floor a third time, House Republicans voted to ditch Jordan as their party's speaker nominee. Jordan lost the closed-door secret ballot vote 112 to 86, per CNN .\n\nThe House GOP will open the contest up to new candidates and meet again on Monday.\n\nJordan's defeat means that three of the most prominent figures in the House GOP - former speaker Kevin McCarthy, Majority Leader Steve Scalise, and Jordan - have now failed to unite the fractious conference.\n\nRight-wing holdouts deposed McCarthy and doomed Scalise's speakership bid by insisting on a hardliner as speaker. But those holdouts have now been counterbalanced by a newly emerged bloc of mainstream members who took down Jordan and are insisting the speaker not be a hardliner.\n\nThe tremendously difficult challenge is that just one GOP candidate somehow needs to unite nearly all members of both camps, even though they have seemingly irreconcilable demands.\n\nWith such long-established, high-profile Republicans falling flat, several much less well-known members of Congress will now try their luck. Reps. Kevin Hern (R-OK), Jack Bergman (R-MI), Austin Scott (R-GA), Byron Donalds (R-FL), and Mike Johnson (R-LA) declared their candidacies Friday afternoon after the GOP voted to drop Jordan. So did Tom Emmer (R-MN), who's currently the House Majority Whip - No. 3 in GOP leadership. More may follow.\n\nBut here's the math problem that has bedeviled every speaker contender so far this year:\n\nThe GOP's new speaker candidates have little national profile. But perhaps it will take someone who is less firmly associated with either the existing leadership or the hardline-right faction to unite the GOP - someone who can make nice-sounding promises to both sides.\n\nAt least, it's worth a shot. I guess. We are clearly at a \"throwing things at the wall and seeing if anything sticks\" phase of the speaker election morass. So next week, we'll see if the \"some rando\" solution manages to fix things.\n\nThat will mainly be a question for the right-wingers. The mainstream and swing district members generally want to get the House back open and elect a speaker - they just had specific grievances against Jordan - but they'd likely support Generic Republican for the job. The hardliners on the right, though, will have to decide whether to keep holding out in hopes of getting the far-right speaker of their dreams, or whether to come to some sort of compromise.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nAnd Jim Jordan is waiting in the wings.\n\nby Andrew Prokop\n\nFor a brief moment, many Republicans hoped the party's nomination of Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) for speaker of the House could quickly unite their fractious conference.\n\nThat was a pipe dream that ended suddenly on Thursday night, when Scalise told his colleagues he was withdrawing his name from contention.\n\nThe announcement leaves the House GOP in yet further disarray, with the next steps in the leadership contest unclear.\n\nScalise had narrowly triumphed Wednesday in the first step of the speaker election process, an internal vote among House Republicans. That win in theory meant he'd be the party's nominee for the next step: the speaker election vote on the House floor.\n\nBut on Thursday, the extent of the difficulty he faced in attaining the near-unanimous House GOP support he needed for that floor vote became clear as problem after problem piled up.\n\nWith Democrats unanimously opposed, a mere five Republican defections is enough to block Scalise from winning on the House floor - and by afternoon, more than a dozen had already said they wouldn't vote for him, according to CNN's Haley Talbot . Most (though not all) of this opposition came from right-wing hardliners who prefer Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH). Jordan conceded and pledged to support Scalise after the House GOP's internal vote Wednesday, but his supporters weren't all going along.\n\nTake, for instance, Donald Trump , who endorsed Jordan last week. During a radio interview , Trump argued that Scalise's recent blood cancer diagnosis meant he was in \"serious trouble\" and should focus on getting better.\n\nThen former speaker Kevin McCarthy - who reportedly had a tense relationship with Scalise, his number two, this year - undercut his would-be successor Thursday. When asked whether Scalise would come up with the votes he needs: \"It's a big hill,\" McCarthy said . \"He told a lot of people he was gonna be at 150\" in the internal party vote, McCarthy continued, \"but he wasn't there.\" (Scalise beat Jordan by just 113 to 99.)\n\nWhen the GOP conference met again Thursday evening, Scalise had evidently concluded he couldn't get there - and announced he was withdrawing from contention.\n\nJordan will now likely make another attempt at getting the top job, and he'll have hardliners' backing. But his main difficulty might be winning swing district Republicans who may view him as too controversial.\n\nBecause of all this chaos, some frustrated House GOP establishment figures are now floating the unthinkable: asking Democrats for help. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) has said he'd be open to finding \"a bipartisan path forward\" to \"reopen the House,\" but most Republicans would be deeply reluctant to go there unless they conclude there's no other choice.\n\nAfter Scalise won the House GOP conference vote early Wednesday afternoon, things were looking up for him at first. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), who'd spearheaded the effort to depose McCarthy, was on board. \"Long live Speaker Scalise,\" Gaetz told reporters .\n\nAnd though Jordan was initially cagey about whether he'd back Scalise, he agreed to do so just about an hour later, saying he'd help nominate Scalise on the House floor. There was even talk that the House could hold its speaker vote that afternoon.\n\nThat didn't last long; it quickly became clear Scalise didn't yet have the votes he needed.\n\nReps. Lauren Boebert (R-CO), Thomas Massie (R-KY), and Max Miller (R-OH) all announced they would not vote for Scalise on the floor. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) said the same, citing Scalise's cancer. \"I like Steve Scalise, and I like him so much that I want to see him defeat cancer more than sacrifice his health in the most difficult position in Congress ,\" she wrote .\n\nRep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) then went on CNN to say that she'd oppose Scalise on the floor. Mace argued that old Scalise scandals - his 2002 speech to a group founded by white supremacist David Duke and an alleged comment Scalise made around that time that he was Duke \"without the baggage\" - disqualified him.\n\nLater Wednesday, Rep. George Santos (R-NY) - fresh off his latest indictment - posted on X that he had had \"0 contact or outreach\" from Scalise and that he'd oppose him \"come hell or high water I won't change my mind.\"\n\nThe news got worse on Thursday, as Scalise began losing the votes of some members who'd said Wednesday that they would back him, including Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL) and Rep. Eli Crane (R-AZ). Further \"no\" votes piled in, too.\n\nMost of the holdout members are still backing Jordan, and their most common complaint is that Scalise represents a continuation of the GOP's establishment leadership and that a greater shake-up is necessary. Rep. Carlos Gimenez (R-FL), meanwhile, said he'd only cast his ballot for McCarthy on the House floor.\n\nNow that Scalise has pulled out, what happens next is up in the air.\n\nIf Jordan runs again and the House GOP holds another internal vote, the question will be how strong Jordan's support is and whether anyone steps up to challenge him. Perhaps now the dynamics will flip and swing district Republicans will be the holdouts to a Jordan nomination. But it's also possible that, exhausted by the chaos, they'll simply give in and support Jordan. Of course, Jordan would need near-unanimous support from Republicans on the House floor. Alternatively, a new dark horse candidate could arise.\n\nThere's even that prospect of a deal with Democrats. Rep. Mike Rogers (R-AL) said that the GOP might never get 217 votes for a speaker due to \"traitors\" in the conference and that Democrats must help.\n\nRep. David Joyce (R-OH), meanwhile, said that perhaps a deal could be cut with Democrats to make Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC), currently serving as speaker pro tempore, officially the speaker on a short-term basis. That could get the chamber - and the country - through the next government funding deadline in mid-November.\n\nBut the likely next question going forward is just how unpalatable Jordan is to swing district and establishment-friendly Republicans.\n\nUpdate, October 12, 8:15 pm ET: This story was originally published Thursday afternoon and has been updated to reflect Scalise's withdrawal from the speaker's race.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nHouse Republicans are going after the DA's work on Trump's indictment. Bragg is fighting back.\n\nby Li Zhou\n\nOn Monday, House Judiciary Chair Jim Jordan (R-OH) once again attacked Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg , this time on his home turf in New York City.\n\nRep. Jordan has been criticizing Bragg's leadership for weeks, as the DA pursues charges against former President Donald Trump related to falsifying business records. This week, the lawmaker continued that onslaught by holding a field hearing in New York City about crime in the city and alleging that Bragg wasn't doing enough to curb it. The goal, essentially, was to make Bragg seem to be ineffective at best, and incompetent at worst.\n\nThe hearing featured multiple witnesses Republicans brought in to discuss their experiences with crime in New York, including a person who experienced an antisemitic attack in Times Square and a bodega owner who was charged with murder following his stabbing of an attacker.\n\nDemocrats pushed back on the hearing, arguing that the panel was a \"political stunt.\" A Bragg spokesperson noted that New York City was the \"safest big city in America\" and cited data that found that shootings and homicides had declined in the city in the first quarter of the year. Jordan's hearing comes as his standoff with Bragg has intensified, and as Republicans have sought new ways to defend Trump from any perceptions that the former president has done anything wrong.\n\nBragg has hit back at the GOP, most notably by filing a lawsuit against Jordan in an effort to block Republicans' demands that witnesses from Bragg's office testify before Congress. The suit also hopes to negate the GOP's efforts to obtain documents related to Trump's indictment . Bragg also argues in the lawsuit that federal lawmakers shouldn't be interfering in a local criminal case, and is specifically seeking to block the testimony of former prosecutor Mark Pomerantz, who Jordan has subpoenaed.\n\nJordan responded to that suit by arguing \"the prospect of a politically motivated prosecution of a former President could give rise to issues of substantial federal concern\" and that Congress has a right to investigate such efforts in order to consider legislative responses.\n\nA judge is scheduled to make a decision on the lawsuit on Wednesday. That move could determine to what degree Republicans can continue to use their congressional investigations to distract the public from the 34 counts of falsifying business records that Trump's been indicted on.\n\nHouse Republicans' attacks on Bragg go beyond his spat with Jordan. GOP lawmakers from the speaker to rank-and-file members have aggressively gone after the Manhattan DA as they've mounted a vocal defense of Trump.\n\n\"Alvin Bragg has irreparably damaged our country in an attempt to interfere in our Presidential election,\" House Speaker Kevin McCarthy previously said in a tweet . \"The American people will not tolerate this injustice, and the House of Representatives will hold Alvin Bragg and his unprecedented abuse of power to account.\"\n\nAnother attack that Republicans have used is pointing out that Bragg used federal funds to conduct his investigation. Bragg's office has responded by noting that it's used about $5,000 in federal dollars in order to conduct investigations into Trump and his companies, including litigation over access to his tax returns. These funds come from federal forfeiture funds the DA's office helped collect, and not federal grant programs, Bragg's office said.\n\nJordan's investigation and demands for testimony and documents are a major part of the push to continue going after Bragg. By calling Bragg's motivations and the legitimacy of his case into question, Republicans hope to defuse - or at least distract from - the charges against Trump. In doing so, they're also showing their supporters how hard they're advocating for the former president, who maintains a strong grip on the GOP base, whether or not they actually obtain the testimony and documents they've requested.\n\nAs Kaleigh Rogers has written for FiveThirtyEight , House Republicans' demands for information in an active criminal investigation are unprecedented, and convincing a court to enforce a subpoena regarding an active criminal case is poised to be tough.\n\nStill, the House GOP has made it clear it plans to try. The crime hearing on Monday was only the latest expansion of those actions.\n\nUpdate, April 17, 4:40 pm ET: This story was originally published on April 12 and has been updated to include a hearing on crime held this week.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nRepublicans have repeatedly attempted to shift the focus onto the whistleblower to undermine the substance of the allegations. Tuesday was no different.\n\nby Li Zhou\n\nFor weeks now, Republicans have said they'd like to unmask the whistleblower who filed a complaint about President Donald Trump's conduct with Ukraine, despite concerns that it could put that individual at risk .\n\nAnd during a public impeachment hearing on Tuesday, they kept up this push. Rep. Devin Nunes, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, pressed Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman on the briefing he gave about a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to someone in the Intelligence Community.\n\nHouse Intelligence Chair Adam Schiff emphasized repeatedly, however, that the hearing would not be used to expose the whistleblower.\n\nShifting the focus to the whistleblower - and his credibility - was one (of many) diversion tactics employed by the president and congressional Republicans almost as soon as the complaint came to light in September.\n\nGOP lawmakers have slammed the complaint as \"secondhand\" and \"hearsay\" in a bid to question the allegations that are detailed by the whistleblower, while Trump has suggested that this person is a partisan actor. He's led the charge in calling for the exposure of the whistleblower's identity, arguing that he should be able to face his accuser.\n\nBeyond Republicans' political motivations for pushing this argument, however, there's little reason to name the whistleblower, since the impeachment inquiry is no longer really about him: The allegations listed in the original complaint have already been corroborated by other witnesses - not to mention Trump himself.\n\nWhat's more, whistleblower protection laws, including those that govern the Intelligence Community, enable government employees to file whistleblower complaints confidentially specifically to protect them from potential blowback. As NPR notes , though, there is no law that bars a member of Congress or the president from publicly naming the whistleblower.\n\nIn their attempts to undermine the complaint against Trump, Republican efforts to expose the whistleblower could have a massive chilling effect: They could endanger the person who has been named and they could deter future whistleblowers from coming forward.\n\nUnderstand the impeachment process, from its history to what comes next. Explore the full guide here .\n\nSince Republicans have struggled to defend the substance of the accusations against Trump, they've sought to redirect the focus toward other aspects of the investigation including the process behind the inquiry , Hunter Biden's ties to a Ukrainian corporation, and, of course, the whistleblower.\n\n\"The whistleblower is a disgrace to our country. A disgrace. And the whistleblower, because of that, should be revealed,\" Trump has said .\n\nTrump's allies have taken a variety of approaches to call out the whistleblower: They've floated names in the closed-door committee depositions and at least one has posted an article on social media that names a specific individual. The whistleblower's attorneys have declined to confirm his identity.\n\nRepublicans are actively focusing on the whistleblower in an effort to sow doubt about both the legitimacy of the complaint and the rationale for filing it. \"One of the ways you determine someone's credibility to determine what their motivation is, what kind of bias they have, is they need to be under oath answering your questions,\" Rep. Jim Jordan said during a Fox News appearance.\n\nAs their logic goes, if the whistleblower came in with a preconceived bias, that could affect how reliable they are as a witness to wrongdoing.\n\nThe party's dedication to protecting the president makes sense given his ongoing popularity with members of the Republican base, but the emphasis on the whistleblower specifically is something that's faced resistance from GOP lawmakers as well.\n\nAlthough lawmakers including Sen. Rand Paul and Jordan have been out front in the push to make the whistleblower publicly known, a number of Republicans have said that the individual's identity should be protected.\n\nAs the law currently stands, the Inspector General who the whistleblower reports the complaint to is required to keep the person's identity anonymous unless they need to share it as they process the complaint. However, as experts told NPR, there is nothing in the statute that directly limits the president or a member of Congress from divulging the whistleblower's name.\n\nSeveral Republican Senators have argued that lawmakers shouldn't expose the whistleblower. \"This person appears to have followed the whistleblower protection laws and ought to be heard out and protected. We should always work to respect whistleblowers' requests for confidentiality,\" Sen. Chuck Grassley said in an October statement .\n\nSens. Mitt Romney, Susan Collins, and John Thune are among those who told the Hill that the whistleblower protections should stay intact.\n\n\"Whistleblowers are entitled to protection under the law ... To try to reveal the identity of this individual is contrary to the intent of the whistleblower law,\" Collins told the Hill.\n\nThere are a lot of potential consequences from unmasking the whistleblower - few of them good. He could face professional backlash in the form of a firing, demotion, or removal of security clearance. Additionally, the whistleblower might experience personal threats to his safety, a chief reason their counsel has said they would prefer responding to written questions instead of providing in-person testimony.\n\n\"As a direct consequence of the President's irresponsible rhetoric and behavior, my client's physical safety became a significant concern, prompting us to instead state our willingness to only answer written interrogatories,\" Andrew Bakaj, the whistleblower's attorney, wrote in a letter to White House legal counsel , calling on Trump to stop his attacks.\n\nIn the past, Trump's targeting of lawmakers including Reps. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib have resulted in a surge of death threats aimed at the two women. It's possible this could happen with the whistleblower as well, and it's among the many reasons he'd like to keep his identity secret.\n\nIf exposed, the whistleblower also has limited recourse, professionally, because he is a member of the intelligence community. Unlike whistleblowers from elsewhere in the government, he legally isn't able to publicly discuss professional retaliation he might encounter because of how sensitive his role is - and the onus to challenge such blowback would be on him.\n\nWhile many Republicans continue to use the whistleblower as a flashpoint, the allegations he raised have already been corroborated both by other witnesses and, in part, by the president.\n\nThat means the ploy to expose the whistleblower feels much less substantive and much more like a crutch for Republican attacks, Vox's Andrew Prokop recently told Today, Explained :\n\nIt seems more of an effort at retaliation rather than a good faith effort to check their information, because the person's information has already been completely confirmed at this point by all the documents and testimony from other witnesses that have come out.\n\nThe whistleblower's identity seems pretty irrelevant at this point, but Trump really wants a villain and he is trying to put a face on this whistleblower to have a new hate figure for conservative media to fulminate about deep state conspiracies against the president.\n\nThe chief allegations in the original complaint centered on how the president had asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Hunter Biden, the son of 2020 rival Joe Biden. This claim has already been directly corroborated by a summary the White House has released of the call and by multiple witnesses who've testified in House Democrats' inquiry.\n\nThe whistleblower complaint also stated that White House officials sought to place the original call transcript in a secure server, a move that's been confirmed by testimony from White House Ukraine adviser Alexander Vindman.\n\nUltimately, the whistleblower's identity doesn't change the revelations that have come out about Trump attempting to pressure Zelensky. It does, however, give Republicans something specific to fixate on as they try to cast doubt on the accusations of wrongdoing faced by the president.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Steve Scalise (R-LA) narrowly won a vote among House Republicans to be the party's nominee for the next speaker of the House Wednesday - but whether he can lock down enough votes to actually get the job isn't yet clear.\n\nAccording to multiple reports , Scalise prevailed over Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) by a secret ballot vote of 113 to 99. But that's just step one in the speaker election process. Step two, in which the speaker election is conducted publicly by the full House of Representatives, is more difficult.\n\nTo actually win the speakership, Scalise needs to win a majority on the House floor. That's the hard part. Because of the GOP's small majority - if all Democrats oppose a GOP speaker candidate, as is traditionally the case - it only takes a few GOP defections to sink him. This is why McCarthy struggled to win the speakership in the first place back in January and failed to hold on to it when his speakership was put to another vote last week.\n\nThere are currently 221 House Republicans, and a speaker candidate will need to win the votes of 217 of them on the floor. Since Scalise only got 113 votes in step one, that means he'll have to win over a lot more Republicans.\n\nThere have been ideological divisions at play, with Jordan favored by hardliners on the right, endorsed by Trump, and feared by some more moderate members. But there are also personal divisions: Some McCarthy allies reportedly believe Scalise did not do enough to back McCarthy and are not eager to ease the Louisianan's path to the speakership.\n\nThe question now is whether enough GOP hardliners will fall in line behind Scalise or whether they will make trouble for him on the House floor, as they did for McCarthy. For instance, Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO) reportedly said Wednesday after Scalise's win that she will vote for Jordan on the floor.\n\nSo though Scalise and Jordan have been the main names in the running, speculation about other options continues. Some have wondered if Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC), currently serving as speaker pro tempore, will be granted more powers if deadlock continues amid an international crisis , with some suggesting he could end up in the job permanently . Other Republicans have talked about nominating McCarthy again - though McCarthy, who initially left the possibility open, appeared to close the door to that Tuesday.\n\nThe House speaker election unfolds in a two-step process. First is the party vote: The majority party meets by itself, behind closed doors, and votes by secret ballot for speaker nominees. Second is the full House vote: All members of the House vote, in public, and whoever gets a majority there becomes speaker.\n\nHistorically, that second step has been a formality. The House speaker election has effectively been settled by the internal party vote - the losing candidate would concede and the winner there would get the support they need for a majority on the House floor, keeping the decision \"within the family,\" so to speak.\n\nThat norm started to fray during the tumultuous years after Republicans' 2010 takeover of the House. Throughout his tenure, Speaker John Boehner consistently held onto a solid majority of support among House Republicans. But a faction of hardline conservatives, either genuinely disenchanted with Boehner's leadership or opportunistically pandering to the right-wing base, worked to force his ouster anyway.\n\nThe hardliners had no chance of defeating Boehner in internal votes of the Republican conference. But by 2015, they'd realized that they could withhold their support from Boehner on the floor - effectively joining with Democrats to deny Boehner the majority he needed to keep his job.\n\nThen-Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), Trump's future White House chief of staff, exploited another little-used House rule that allowed any member to effectively force a no-confidence vote on the speaker: the motion to vacate the chair. Seeing the possibility of his ouster looming, Boehner preemptively resigned before he could be deposed. Then-House Ways and Means Committee chair Paul Ryan (R-WI) eventually emerged as the consensus candidate who could unite the GOP's factions.\n\nAfter Ryan's retirement and Republicans' loss of their House majority in 2018, McCarthy was in line to be the GOP's minority leader - but he did face a challenge from Jordan. The minority leader, however, does not need to be elected by the whole House. So a closed-door, secret ballot vote of 159-43 was enough for McCarthy to win.\n\nBut when Republicans regained their majority in the 2022 midterms , they'd be electing a speaker again. The first step of the process - the closed-door party vote - went well for McCarthy. He defeated Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ), 188 to 31.\n\nThen, though, came the floor vote this January, in which 20 of McCarthy's critics did not initially fall in line behind him. Since the GOP's new majority was quite small, that proved enough to deny him the majority he needed for 14 ballots over four days.\n\nIn the end, McCarthy cut a deal with some of them - a deal that in the end set the stage for McCarthy's downfall, when just eight defecting Republicans joined with Democrats to remove McCarthy from his post.\n\nFor this current speakership election, the new reality seems clear: both steps of the two-step process will be contested. To win step one, the party vote, it would take just 111 of 221 Republicans for a majority, if all of them were present and voting. (Scalise won by 113 to 99.)\n\nBut to win step two, the floor vote, 217 of 221 Republicans would be necessary, assuming no Democratic crossover votes.\n\nSo Scalise's victory in the GOP's internal vote this week should be better understood as something like a preview for the real fight to come.\n\nScalise is generally viewed as the more establishment-friendly figure, though he is quite conservative, and has his own controversial past - in 2002, he spoke at a convention for a group founded by white supremacist David Duke. (Scalise later claimed he was unaware the group, the European-American Unity and Rights Organization, was racist.)\n\nOne would think Scalise, who was McCarthy's number two as House majority leader, would mean continuity with the existing leadership. Yet all year, the congressional gossip mill has claimed that McCarthy distrusted Scalise and was cutting him out of major decisions. Scalise also recently announced his diagnosis with blood cancer, leading some members to question whether he can do the job.\n\nJordan, meanwhile, has historically been among the hardest of House GOP hardliners - Boehner once called him \" a legislative terrorist .\" But Jordan has mostly been a team player working well with McCarthy this year, and hasn't been a thorn in his side; for instance, he backed McCarthy's debt ceiling deal . That's because McCarthy has given Jordan a free hand in running the House Judiciary Committee, pursuing investigations aimed at providing red meat for the conservative base.\n\nIt's difficult to discern how the House would function differently with either Scalise or Jordan as speaker. Perhaps Scalise would cut a more reasonable government funding deal than Jordan. Alternatively, perhaps Jordan would have an easier time convincing hardliners there's no better deal possible. Both would inevitably feel compelled to cater to the right, but Jordan has a more aggressive history and rhetorical style.\n\nScalise prevailed in the conference vote, but only 113 Republicans voted for him. That's a long way from the 217 he needs. Many will fall in line, but only a handful of defections could sink him. So the question is just how stubborn the holdout Republicans will prove to be. Jordan, too, will face a choice about whether he'll drop out of the running and endorse Scalise, or continue to press his bid.\n\nUpdate, October 11, 1:40 pm ET: This article was originally published on October 10.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThis is not a win for free speech. It's a political grenade.\n\nby Adam Clark Estes\n\nThis week Mark Zuckerberg sent Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) a letter outlining how the Biden administration pressured his company to \"censor\" free speech on Facebook - specifically misinformation about Covid-19. The letter also made reference to Hunter Biden's laptop and Zuckerberg's lack of plans to spend money on the election. This sounds bad. But none of this information is new.\n\nIt's interesting that Zuckerberg decided to dive into the free speech snake pit this week. It's also not surprising that Republicans, who have been on a book-banning spree at schools nationwide, are propping up old facts as if they were new revelations in their ongoing quest to blame Democrats for censorship. It's election season, and questioning reality is part of the fun.\n\nAs we enter the final two months before the election, there are fewer guardrails for misinformation in place on major social media platforms, and writing a letter about the Biden administration and censorship, Zuckerberg seems to be throwing Republicans a political grenade, something that can fire up the base and use to get mad about Democrats. In reality, though, Zuckerberg is probably just trying to keep his company out of more hot water and to continue revamping his own public image .\n\nTo understand how Zuckerberg's letter could do this, it helps to know why he sent it to Rep. Jordan in the first place.\n\nJordan, chair of the House Judiciary Committee, has singled out the Meta CEO in an ongoing investigation that alleges the Biden administration and tech companies colluded to censor free speech online. Jordan even threatened to hold Zuckerberg in contempt of Congress for ignoring a subpoena for documents. Zuckerberg now seems rather forthcoming.\n\nIn his letter , Zuckerberg acknowledges that the Biden administration pressured the company \"to censor certain Covid-19 content, including humor and satire\" and says that the pressure was \"wrong.\" Zuckerberg added that his company was \"ready to push back if something like this happens again.\"\n\nThis is not news. The Biden administration did pressure Meta, as well as its competitors, to crack down on Covid-19 misinformation throughout the pandemic. In 2021, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called it \"an urgent threat,\" and Biden himself said that misinformation was \"killing people,\" a statement he later walked back . This pressure was also at the center of a recent Supreme Court case, in which justices ruled in favor of the Biden administration .\n\nWe also knew that Meta, then known simply as Facebook, pushed back at efforts to stop the spread of misinformation on its platforms. Not long after Biden's \"killing people\" remark, leaked company documents revealed that Facebook knew that vaccine misinformation on its platforms was undermining its own goal of protecting the vaccine rollout and was causing harm. It even studied the broader problem and produced several internal reports on the spread of misinformation, but despite pressure from Congress, Facebook failed to share that research with lawmakers at the time.\n\nWe actually learned about the specific kind of pressure the White House put on Facebook a year ago, thanks to documents the company turned over to, you guessed it, Jim Jordan and the House Judiciary Committee.\n\nThe Biden administration issued a statement after Zuckerberg's latest letter became public. It said, in part, \"Our position has been clear and consistent: We believe tech companies and other private actors should take into account the effects their actions have on the American people, while making independent choices about the information they present.\"\n\nBut the Zuckerberg letter didn't stop with details of the well-known crackdown on Covid misinformation. It also reminds the public of the time, ahead of the 2020 election, the FBI warned social media companies that a New York Post article about Hunter Biden's laptop could be part of a Russian disinformation campaign. Without mentioning any direct pressure from the government, Zuckerberg says in the letter that his company demoted the laptop story while it conducted a fact-check. He told podcaster Joe Rogan something similar in a 2022 interview , when he mentioned that an FBI disinformation warning contributed to the decision to suppress the story. Twitter also suppressed the laptop story, and its executives denied that there was pressure from Democrats or law enforcement to do so.\n\nZuckerberg also addresses some donations he made to voting access efforts in the 2020 election through his family's philanthropic foundation. \"My goal is to be neutral and not play a role one way or another - or to even appear to be playing a role,\" the billionaire said. \"So I don't plan on making a similar contribution this cycle.\" The House Judiciary Committee responded in a tweet , \"Mark Zuckerberg also tells the Judiciary Committee that he won't spend money this election cycle. That's right, no more Zuck-bucks.\" Neither party mentioned that Zuckerberg also declined to make a contribution in the 2022 cycle for the same reasons.\n\nThe right is taking a victory lap over this Zuckerberg letter. Others are simply wondering why on earth, on an otherwise quiet week in August, did Zuckerberg even bother to remind us of all of these familiar facts?\n\nOne theory comes from Peter Kafka at Business Insider : \"Zuckerberg very carefully gave Jordan just enough to claim a political victory - but without getting Meta in any further trouble while it defends itself against a federal antitrust suit.\"\n\nTo be clear, Congress is not behind the antitrust lawsuit. The case, which dates back to 2021, comes from the FTC and 40 states, which say that Facebook illegally crushed competition when it acquired Instagram and WhatsApp, but it must be top of mind for Zuckerberg. In a landmark antitrust case less than a month ago, a federal judge ruled against Google , and called it a monopoly. So antitrust is almost certainly on Zuckerberg's mind.\n\nIt's also possible Zuckerberg was just sick of litigating events that happened years ago and wanted to close the loop on something that has caused his company massive levels of grief. Plus, allegations of censorship have been a distraction from his latest big mission: to build artificial general intelligence .\n\nZuckerberg, according to his new style, is a newly minted member of Gen Z , one who's future-focused and patriotic in a way. For all we know, dashing off controversial-seeming letters to Congress is part of this revamped image and yet another way of reminding the world that he does not want to be involved in politics again .\n\nCorrection, August 28, 10 am ET: A previous version of this story misstated what organization warned social media companies about the spread of a New York Post article about Hunter Biden's laptop ahead of the 2020 election.\n\nThe lessons liberals should take away from their election defeat - and a closer look at where they should go next.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nHouse Republicans are still looking for their next Benghazi. But their investigations are unpopular.\n\nby Christian Paz\n\nEven before they had taken control of the House, House Republicans were promising payback .\n\nUsing the powers of the various congressional committees that they would soon take over, ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus members, led by Reps. James Comer of Kentucky and Jim Jordan of Ohio, were pledging investigations of everything: the Biden family's business practices, Hunter Biden's laptop, the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, alleged government bias against conservatives, and the Biden administration's border policies.\n\nBut so far, these investigations seem to be flopping. They don't seem to be sticking in the public consciousness. They haven't uncovered page one news about Hunter Biden's laptop, or about the origins of Covid-19, or about a supposed government conspiracy to silence conservatives on Twitter. A bit more than two months into Republican control of the House, plenty of these investigations are well underway. Hearings have been held, letters sent, witnesses summoned, and hours spent appearing on Fox News .\n\nThe House GOP investigations also aren't making the president's reelection campaign untenable - many Democratic operatives suspected that was their goal - and they don't seem to be damaging the president as many Republicans had hoped.\n\nOf course, it's still early, and in the more than year and a half before the 2024 presidential election, Republicans could still weaponize their committee investigations into better political cudgels. A handful of additional hearings are on the calendar, but more remain unscheduled. If Republicans had hoped to establish the same kind of cloud of confusion and innuendo that they did during the Obama years to tarnish the president's reputation and hurt Hillary Clinton's presidential hopes, they have yet to achieve that with Biden.\n\nNew polling provided to Vox by the progressive research group Navigator further demonstrates this trend: Half of American adults believe Republicans are overreaching in their oversight of the Biden administration, up from the 46 percent who said so in a February poll and the 30 percent who said so in January. The number who view the GOP's investigations as a form of overreach is also rising among political independents, while Republican support for the investigations is remaining steady.\n\nThe president's approval rating remains virtually unchanged (though it's trended up since the midterms). House Republicans continue to be tremendously unpopular. And more Americans today see the House GOP's oversight investigations negatively when compared to when they took control.\n\nThe big reason these investigations don't seem to be breaking through is pretty simple: They just aren't that popular, and never really were. And it's not just Navigator's polling that shows Americans aren't very receptive to whatever comes out of these hearings. Since January, a series of Pew, NBC , and Public Policy Polling surveys have shown that most Americans don't see these investigations as priorities for Congress, or would rather Republicans spend less time pursuing these lines of inquiry in favor of addressing more tangible, everyday issues (first among them being inflation and the cost of household goods).\n\nFor example, when Pew Research asked Americans in mid-January how they felt about the GOP's new focus on investigating the Biden administration, the answers were pretty definitive - 65 percent worried Republicans would focus \"too much,\" while 32 percent thought they wouldn't pay enough attention. Even Republicans were split closely; 42 percent of Republican adults said they thought Republicans would focus on oversight too much , compared to the 56 percent who feared lawmakers wouldn't go far enough.\n\nNavigator also found that a plurality of Americans don't see these inquiries as serious, good-faith efforts at oversight - including 38 percent of independents who think they are \"political stunts.\"\n\nNavigator's chief of polling, Bryan Bennett, told me that in the runup to and aftermath of the midterms, Republicans may have misjudged just how much to play up their proposed investigations, and made a strategic error hyping up the investigations that are of least interest to Americans.\n\nIn Navigator voter focus groups in Wisconsin, Virginia, and Texas, voters seemed most open to investigations into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, China-US trade practices, and the withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\nBut those aren't the investigations that House Republicans have prioritized. The panel investigating the origins of the coronavirus, for example, has only met once, earlier in March, and a second hearing is scheduled for Tuesday (scrutinizing school closures). The Foreign Affairs Committee, which is investigating the Afghanistan withdrawal, meanwhile, has sent letters to the State Department requesting more information and held one hearing on the fall of Kabul , but it did not have any witnesses from the executive branch testifying. Meanwhile, James Comer, the chair of the oversight committee, has spent hours on Fox News pushing the committee's investigation into Hunter Biden's laptop and the Biden family's business practices. They've held one hearing already and have more planned.\n\nThese hearing topics, Bennett said, are the ones that independent voters are most likely to view with disdain and distrust. \"The reasons that were cited for that included that there was kind of this broad perception that it was seen as being like a revenge list or a tit-for-tat, or a 'get even' list, and that it wasn't really particularly focused on ... the priorities that people want Congress to focus on.\"\n\nComer has also managed to become Republicans' standard-bearer for investigations, assuming the role of chief White House congressional antagonist on Fox News, Newsmax, and One America News. But the decision to take on that role also poses a problem - not many people know him outside of conservative circles, and scrutiny into his past has dredged up old allegations of abuse of a girlfriend and a shady track record of political maneuvering . (Comer's office did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nBeyond the general unpopularity of these investigations, Republicans have some other structural and political obstacles. Democrats are not letting these probes go on unanswered, a lesson from the Benghazi investigations during the Obama years. A collection of Democratic and progressive groups , like the Congressional Integrity Project, are working hard outside of government to paint these Republican investigations as illegitimate and the investigators as abusers of congressional power.\n\nThe White House itself is also proactively responding to various Republican lines of attack with frequent conversations with reporters, led by Ian Sams, the White House's chief spokesperson on these investigations. Sams and the White House Counsel's office have also gotten ahead of other potential vulnerabilities, like the discovery of classified documents at Biden's home and private offices, by preemptively briefing reporters and blasting out clips and quotes of Comer, Jordan, and other Republicans talking about the political nature of these investigations.\n\nThere's also a problem of novelty and nicheness. Many of the subjects that Republicans have pledged to investigate don't feel fresh or new. Hunter Biden's laptop and his business dealings were a 2020 matter; the Afghanistan withdrawal and coronavirus pandemic feel like years-old issues; and the questioning of social media companies and alleged government bias against conservatives are issues that may only truly resonate with the most partisan, internet-pilled Republican voters.\n\nThe oversight committee, especially, may simply be picking too many targets to pursue - it's also investigating the conditions of January 6 defendants in the DC jail, the capital city's legislative work, the impact of \"progressivism\" on the military, pandemic relief fraud, and coronavirus school closures, among many other things .\n\n\"The American public is already tired of these,\" Brad Woodhouse, a senior adviser to the Congressional Integrity Project, a group of Democratic operatives, told me. \"I understand there's some support within the Republican base, but the American public writ large are already tired of these extreme tactics.\"\n\nThere are also real questions about productivity: The committees simply haven't held that many meetings, and none have featured people who have enough of a high profile to garner attention beyond niche conservative spaces. \"I haven't seen a single guy sweating under the bright lights,\" Fox News host Jesse Watters complained in early March . \"Are we gonna drill down on anything? Are we going to see anybody squirm and cough up the truth or at least plead the Fifth or something, so that we can start showering these goons with subpoenas? Where are the bombshells? Have the investigations even started?\"\n\nDonald Trump himself is also sucking up the energy and attention of the political press and the American public. As his presidential campaign blunders on, and a number of federal, state, and local investigations into his dealings with campaign money, classified documents, liability for January 6, and potential obstruction of justice continue, he has reinforced himself as one of Democrats' best tools for diverting attention from the House investigations.\n\nFinally, Republicans will also face a longer-term problem of political inertia. Given how unfavorably the public has been viewing these probes so far, they have limited time to change opinions, Bennett said. \"The longer that you have these kind of [negative] ratings, the more entrenched that view is going to become, and the harder it's going to be to recover.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nWill the \"Never Jordan\" bloc cave? Will there be a bipartisan deal? Or ... what?\n\nby Andrew Prokop\n\nOn Thursday morning, House Republican leaders had hoped they'd finally found a way out of their bitter speaker's race standoff. The idea was, they'd punt the contest until January, when Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) would again try to win over Republican holdouts. In the meantime, they'd empower the guy currently sitting in the speaker chair on a temporary basis, Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC).\n\nJordan himself had agreed to the plan. But when it was presented at the Republican conference, many rank-and-file members recoiled from it. The right was furious, viewing the proposal as an attempt to undercut them and deal with Democrats. So by the afternoon, the McHenry proposal appeared to be dead, and Jordan said he'd keep trying to win the speaker's race now - placing us back where we started at the beginning of the week.\n\nRepublicans' staring contest of a speaker's race, then, is continuing, with no resolution in sight. Here's the GOP's math problem:\n\nSo what are the ways this could end?\n\n1) The \"Never Jordan\" bloc caves : Jordan is currently the GOP's speaker nominee, and he's still trying to win over enough support among the 22 Republicans who opposed him on the most recent House floor vote.\n\nSome of these members are powerful Appropriations Committee Republicans who could be given promises over how Jordan will handle spending fights. Others represent swing districts and fear support for an extremist candidate like Jordan could hurt their reelection, but they'll need support and fundraising from the party establishment to keep their seats. And other holdouts appear to be motivated by personal gripes over how Jordan treated the previous speaker nominee, Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) - maybe their feelings could be assuaged?\n\n2) The \"Only Jordan\" bloc settles for someone else : If Jordan can't win over enough holdouts and quits the contest as Scalise did, the GOP will go back to the drawing board and try to select another speaker nominee.\n\nThe question then will be whether that person can win over the hardcore Jordan supporters on the right. These recalcitrant right-wingers made it difficult for Kevin McCarthy to be elected speaker in the first place in January - but he did eventually win enough of them over. Perhaps another candidate, not yet in the race, could do the same. (Or maybe McCarthy could do it again.)\n\n3) Some Republicans cut a deal with Democrats : If neither bloc of GOP holdouts is in the mood to cave, one other option is to rely on Democrats to get a Republican speaker candidate elected. In theory, such a deal could take place with a small group of Democratic moderates, or through a deal cut with Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) that has the Democratic Party's official approval.\n\nAny such deal would draw fury from conservative media, and GOP leaders have already tried to denounce any idea for a \"coalition government.\" This is why the recent proposal to empower McHenry via some Democratic votes got dropped like a hot potato. But if the far right truly seems impossible to win over, a bipartisan deal may seem to mainstream Republicans like the only option to keep the government open.\n\n4) McHenry just takes the reins without an official vote : Up to this point, speaker pro tempore McHenry has interpreted his duties as limited to facilitating the election of a new speaker. He has said he doesn't want to do any more than this, and the belief within the GOP conference was that for him to be able to do more, the House would have to vote to empower him.\n\nOutside experts, though, have argued that such a vote might not be necessary. Brendan Buck, a former aide to speakers John Boehner and Paul Ryan, wrote a New York Times op-ed arguing that McHenry \"may simply need to act on his own.\" That is, he should start calling up resolutions or bills, and if any member of Congress objects, just put it to a vote and see if a majority of the House backs him. \"All of this is unstable and unsustainable, but so too is our current course,\" Buck wrote.\n\n5) It doesn't end : Finally, for the sake of completion, one more possibility (albeit right now an extremely remote one) is that the House simply remains speaker-less until 2025. This would mean an unprecedented, devastating 13-month government shutdown with unforeseen consequences - something enough Republicans would likely want to cut short so they won't be blamed for it. It would also mean an end to legislation for the next year, including perceived \"must-pass\" measures like aid to Israel . So it seems unlikely things would go this far.

      "text": "What to know about Jim Jordan's role in Jan. 6\n\nDemocrats call the GOP firebrand running for speaker an \"insurrectionist.\"\n\nRep. Jim Jordan is now front and center of House Republicans' chaotic effort to elect a new House speaker after the historic ouster of Kevin McCarthy and it's called new attention to what critics say were his efforts overturn the 2020 election.\n\nJordan, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and a staunch ally of former President Donald Trump, won the party's nomination last week only after House Majority Leader Steve Scalise dropped out of the running.\n\nJordan could be put to the test on the House floor as soon as Tuesday, though on Monday still faced an uphill climb for the 217 votes he will need to win the gavel.\n\nHis rise from House Freedom Caucus founder to a national figure is marked, in part, by his behavior in the aftermath of the 2020 election and leading up to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nJordan was one of the 147 Republicans to vote to reject the 2020 election results in Pennsylvania and Arizona.\n\nHouse Democrats, who all voted to topple McCarthy, have pointed to Jordan's actions as proof he is unsuitable for the job.\n\n\"At every single turn, Jim Jordan has prioritized politics, power, fear, division and hate over the American people,\" Democratic Whip Katherine Clark said last week.\n\nClark added, \"Every Republican who casts their vote for him is siding with an insurrectionist against our democracy.\"\n\nAlso blasting Jordan is former Rep. Liz Cheney, once the No. 2 House Republican whose role as vice chair of the House Jan. 6 Committee made her a GOP outcast and effectively ended her career in Congress.\n\n\"Jim Jordan was involved in Trump's conspiracy to steal the election and seize power; he urged that Pence refuse to count lawful electoral votes,\" Cheney wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. \"If [Republicans] nominate Jordan to be Speaker, they will be abandoning the Constitution. They'll lose the House majority and they'll deserve to.\"\n\nMeanwhile, he has the backing of Trump and even former Vice President Mike Pence -- who told CNN that while they have a \"difference of opinion\" when it comes to Jan. 6, he believed Jordan would \"lead with integrity.\"\n\nJordan was one prominent figure in the House Jan. 6 Committee's final report, which was the product of more than a year of investigation. His name was mentioned in the document more than a dozen times.\n\nAccording to the panel, Jordan was a \"significant player\" in Trump's attempts to overturn his election loss to Joe Biden.\n\nHe huddled with White House staffers and other Trump allies like Rudy Giuliani numerous times to discuss \"strategies for challenging the election, chief among them claims that the election had been tainted by fraud,\" the committee said, and was involved in conversations about Pence's role specifically as early as November 2020.\n\nFour days before Jan. 6, the committee said Jordan led a call with Trump and others to talk about possible ways to delay the congressional certification of the Electoral College votes. That call also included discussion about social media posts to encourage Trump supporters to come to the Capitol that day.\n\nThen, the day before Jan. 6, Jordan texted then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows to pass along advice that Pence should \"call out all the electoral votes that he believes are unconstitutional as no electoral votes at all.\"\n\nJordan also spoke with Trump \"at least twice\" on Jan. 6, the committee said -- though it noted that he's given inconsistent comments about when they spoke and what exactly they discussed. ABC News had reported that Jordan and Trump spoke in a 10-minute call that morning before the riots unfolded.\n\nJordan repeatedly attacked the committee's integrity, calling it a partisan witch hunt, and refused to comply with a subpoena -- an action that resulted in lawmakers referring him and a handful of other Republican members of Congress to the House Ethics Committee.\n\nABC News' Benjamin Siegel and Lauren Peller contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Strauss is accused of sexually abusing at least 177 men over an 18-year period from 1979 to 1997 -- nearly his entire time at Ohio State, according to an independent report released in 2019.\n\nInvestigators determined that university officials ignored nearly two decades of accusations of sexual abuse against Strauss, who killed himself in 2006 at age 67, seven years after retiring from the university.\n\nThe accusations of abuse involved athletes from at least 16 sports including wrestling, hockey and swimming, and included Strauss' work at the student health center and an off-campus clinic that he founded late in his tenure, according to the report.\n\nThe university removed Strauss as a school physician in 1996 after a flurry of student complaints and reported his actions to the State Medical Board of Ohio. However, the school allowed Strauss to retain his tenured faculty position while he operated an off-campus clinic, where the report says he continued to abuse students.\n\nOhio State University has since admitted that it failed to protect students from Strauss, paying out $60 million in settlements to some 296 victims.\n\nJordan, who was an assistant coach on the team from 1986 to 1994, came under fire in 2018 when several former OSU wrestlers took their allegations against Strauss to the media and claimed Jordan was aware of Strauss' inappropriate behavior and failed to report it. The university then announced it was opening an investigation into the allegations against Strauss.\n\nJordan also denied knowing about the abuse when the allegations first came out in 2018.\n\nJordan is now facing renewed scrutiny amid the ongoing battle for House speaker. After again failing to receive enough GOP support, the congressman and chair of the House Judiciary Committee was defeated a second time after a vote on Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"We believe very strongly, especially all the wrestlers that were there at the time, that Jim Jordan knew what was going on,\" Ratliff said on Wednesday.\n\nRatliff continued, \"Jordan should come forward and tell the truth about what happened. At least meet with the guys. He's failed to do that -- to hear our side, he's failed. You know, even if you believe what Jim Jordan says, he has never once reached out to any wrestler to say, 'Hey, I missed it. I'm sorry. How are you feeling?'\"\n\nABC News' Eric Ortega, Imtiyaz Delawala, Lindsey Griswold, and Andrea Amiel contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Who is Jim Jordan, the House GOP's speaker nominee?\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  October 18, 2023 / 11:12 AM EDT / CBS News\n\nRep. Jim Jordan has so far failed to get enough votes to become the House speaker, as Republicans' path forward remains unclear.\n\nA hard-right conservative from Ohio, Jordan is the face of the GOP investigations into the Biden administration .\n\nHouse Republicans last week formally selected Jordan to be their nominee after their first nominee, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, withdrew his name from consideration. The House has been without a speaker since Oct. 3, when McCarthy was removed from the role in a 216-210 vote.\n\nSince Jordan joined the House in 2007, he has gained a reputation as an outspoken critic of Democratic White Houses whose flamethrowing tactics have singed Republicans as well.\n\nJordan was a founding member of the House Freedom Caucus, a group of the most conservative members of the party that was established to oust then-House Speaker John Boehner, which was ultimately successful. During former President Donald Trump's presidency, Trump found in Jordan an ally who, like Trump, rarely held back.\n\nSo, who is Jim Jordan?\n\nJordan, a 59-year-old native of Troy, Ohio, has spent most of his adult life as a politician, becoming an Ohio state representative in 1995.\n\nA graduate of the University of Wisconsin, Jordan received his law degree from Capital University Law School in Ohio in 2001, the same year he went from being a state representative to a state senator.\n\nJordan was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 2006, and took office in 2007, during former President George W. Bush's second term.\n\nJordan was a founding member of the House Freedom Caucus in 2015, and served as its first chairman from 2015 to 2017. Led by Jordan, the conservative members of the caucus pushed for a motion to \"vacate the chair\" against then-Speaker John Boehner , the same move that ultimately ousted former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy from his speakership. Before any vote could take place, Boehner announced his resignation in September 2015.\n\nSince then, the caucus has become known for its take-it-or-leave-it, conservative stances on policy and the debt limit, often forcing more moderate Republicans to compromise. And its members were some of the most vocal supporters of Trump during his presidency.\n\nJordan was one of Trump's most ardent supporters in the House, and continues to be even after Trump left office.\n\nJordan lambasted the congressional and federal investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. He also sought to prevent the impeachment inquiry hearing over Trump's call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy from proceeding.\n\nAfter the 2020 election, Jordan was also a staunch supporter of challenges to Trump's loss, and he was among the more than 100 House Republicans who signed onto an amicus brief in support of the lawsuit filed with the Supreme Court to challenge the election results. The highest court declined to hear the case.\n\nTrump has endorsed Jordan for speaker.\n\nJordan was a member of the Select Committee on Benghazi, investigating the deaths of four American soldiers at the U.S. embassy in Libya in 2012 when Barack Obama was president and Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. Jordan accused Clinton of failing to lead when the crisis happened.\n\nHe was also the top Republican on the House Oversight Committee when Democrats controlled the House in 2019 and 2020.\n\nNow, Jordan is the chairman of both the House Judiciary Committee and one of its subcommittees, the Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government.\n\nIn those roles during the Biden administration, Jordan, along with House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, has launched hearings and issued subpoenas in an effort to uncover information about the Biden family's business dealings, with a particular interest in Hunter Biden. The president's son faces felony gun charges after a tentative plea agreement between his lawyers and federal prosecutors fell apart in court.\n\nA controversy that has reemerged with Jordan vying for the speakership dates back to his time as a wrestling coach at The Ohio State University before he became a state legislator.\n\nJordan, a two-time NCAA Division I wrestling champion and four-time state champion in high school, worked as an assistant wrestling coach from 1986 to 1994.\n\nTwo former university wrestlers, Mike DiSabato and Dunyasha Yetts, claimed Jordan was aware of allegations that a now-dead team doctor was abusing athletes. Jordan has repeatedly denied any knowledge of the abuse, and Jordan himself has never been accused of sexual misconduct.\n\n\"We knew of no abuse. Never heard of abuse. If we had, we would have reported it,\" Jordan said in 2018 when the ex-wrestlers claimed he was aware.\n\nThe abuse sprang into focus decades after it happened, when former students accused physician Richard Strauss of abusing wrestlers and other athletes. Strauss died by suicide in 2005. An independent investigation conducted by law firm Perkins Coie on behalf of The Ohio State University and released in 2019 alleged Strauss abused at least 177 students while he was a school doctor, including at least 48 wrestlers. The report claimed the late doctor's behavior was an \"open secret\" in the athletics department.\n\nJordan is a close ally of former President Donald Trump, and the two spoke multiple times on Jan. 6, 2021, during the assault on the U.S. Capitol. During the joint session of Congress that day, Jordan was one of the more than 100 House Republicans who voted to overturn the 2020 election results.\n\nJordan has repeatedly refused to discuss his communication with Trump. Despite this, when then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced the creation of a select committee to investigate the events leading up and on Jan. 6, 2021, McCarthy, who was the minority leader, picked Jordan to be one of the Republicans on the committee.\n\nPelosi rejected Jordan and Rep. Jim Banks' nominations given their roles on Jan. 6, leading McCarthy to pull all his Republicans from the committee. In the end, only two Republicans served on the committee, in defiance of McCarthy. Both did not return for the 118th Congress.\n\nUltimately, Jordan refused to cooperate with the House Jan. 6 committee, calling their request to meet with him an \"unprecedented and inappropriate demand.\"\n\nKathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital, based in Washington, D.C.\n\n© 2023 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "text": "Jim Jordan wins House GOP's nomination for speaker, but deep divisions remain\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  October 13, 2023 / 8:16 PM EDT / CBS News\n\nWashington - House Republicans on Friday selected Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio as their second nominee for speaker of the House in less than three days, in the latest attempt to unite the party behind a candidate to fill the role that's been vacant since Rep. Kevin McCarthy's unprecedented ouster last week. The House left for the weekend late Friday afternoon without a permanent speaker.\n\nThe House Republican Conference nominated Jordan by secret ballot in a closed-door meeting less than a day after Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana withdrew his candidacy . The conference previously voted to nominate Scalise over Jordan on Wednesday, but the majority leader failed to attract enough support to win a majority in the full House and dropped his bid by Thursday evening.\n\nJordan won the support of 124 of his Republican colleagues, according to lawmakers. His total surpassed Scalise's tally of 113 from two days ago but still fell far short of the 217 votes that will likely be needed to win the speakership on the House floor. Rep. Austin Scott, a seven-term Georgia Republican, launched a last-minute protest candidacy before Friday's meeting and won roughly 80 votes. Scott told reporters he will back Jordan.\n\nThe next step in the process for electing a new speaker involves a vote of the full House, Democrats included. Scalise's nomination never got that far, since he lacked the support among his own members that would have avoided a long, drawn-out floor battle like the kind that preceded McCarthy's election earlier this year. Jordan will require near unanimity among Republican members to overcome united Democratic opposition.\n\nWhether he will ultimately have better luck than Scalise in uniting the fractured Republican conference remains to be seen, but a follow-up vote made clear that he has a steep hill to climb. Asked whether they plan to support Jordan in a vote of the full House, 152 GOP members said yes, and 55 said no, according to one lawmaker.\n\nRepublicans will not bring Jordan's nomination to the floor immediately, instead choosing to stand in recess for the weekend to give Jordan time to try to win over his detractors.\n\nJordan is a hardline conservative and co-founded the House Freedom Caucus, a group of far-right members who have been a thorn in the side of previous GOP leaders for years. As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the Ohio Republican is also one of the most vocal defenders of former President Donald Trump on Capitol Hill and is playing a leading role in the impeachment inquiry into President Biden.\n\nSeveral moderate Republicans have said they would oppose his candidacy, leaving the future of his bid for the speaker's gavel in doubt.\n\nThe House has been at a standstill since last week's unprecedented ouster of McCarthy, who was unseated after a revolt by eight far-right members who objected to his handling of the recent fight over government funding.\n\nScalise's announcement Thursday evening that he was dropping out came amid mounting opposition to his bid from the GOP conference's right flank, effectively preventing him from being able to secure the 217 votes likely needed to win the gavel in a vote on the House floor. Scalise told reporters he withdrew in hopes that a candidate could emerge who could bring the party together.\n\n\"Our conference still has to come together and is not there,\" he said. \"There are still some people that have their own agendas, and I was very clear, we have to have everybody put their agendas on the side and focus on what this country needs.\"\n\nHis exit added to the chaos that has enveloped the GOP conference since McCarthy's ouster. The House is now in its second week without a leader, leaving one chamber of Congress effectively paralyzed until a speaker is elected.\n\n\"We are a ship that doesn't have a rudder right now,\" Rep. Mark Alford, a freshman member from Texas, told reporters Thursday. \"This is a troubling time for members who came here to do serious business.\"\n\nThe dysfunction among Republicans comes as lawmakers are confronting a fast-approaching Nov. 17 deadline to fund the government and rising pressure to respond to the war in Israel and Gaza following the brutal attacks by Hamas nearly one week ago.\n\nSupporters of Jordan, who secured 99 votes during the first secret ballot vote earlier this week, have suggested he can win the gavel, though his candidacy was already running into resistance from moderate Republicans before his nomination. Rep. Mike Garcia of California indicated some GOP lawmakers would be turned away from supporting the Ohio conservative following the week's events.\n\n\"There's an academic debate about whether we reward, you know, the tyranny of the minority in this case,\" he said, adding that while he supports Jordan, \"there's enough people that would see what has happened and transpired over the last 40 hours to not support him, that we're going to have the same problem with Jordan that we had with Scalise. So, I think it's a math problem.\"\n\nThe prospect of a protracted fight among Republicans over a speaker candidate has prompted some questions of whether the House should act to temporarily expand the authority of Rep. Patrick McHenry, who is leading the chamber in the interim as speaker pro tempore. McHenry was appointed to the post by McCarthy following his removal, though the historic nature of the situation has left the House with no precedent to reference.\n\nWhether McHenry's authority extends beyond overseeing the election of a new speaker is unclear, thanks to some ambiguity in the House rules governing the appointment of a temporary speaker.\n\nSome members have also raised the possibility of a consensus candidate if Jordan fails to secure the required support to become speaker. North Carolina Rep. Greg Murphy raised McHenry and Reps. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma and Byron Donalds of Florida as potential \"compromise\" candidates.\n\n\"There's some real quality people in there that are smart, not only intellectually, but politically, who can fundraise and lead the conference in the direction because our fight is not with each other, it shouldn't be with each other,\" Murphy told reporters before Friday's internal vote.\n\nA group of four moderate House Democrats raised the prospect of empowering McHenry to bring specific bills before the House while the speaker fight plays out. In a letter on Friday, the Democrats wrote that \"Congress should implement temporary, expanded authorities - at fifteen calendar day increments - directing the Speaker Pro Tempore to bring before the House proposed legislation\" dealing with foreign aid to Israel and Ukraine, a continuing resolution to extend government funding until January and remaining annual spending bills.\n\nScott MacFarlane contributed reporting.\n\nStefan Becket is a managing editor of politics for CBSNews.com.

      "text": "Jim Jordan made a name for himself as a Trump ally and face of GOP investigations\n\nEditor's Note: Editor's Note: This story originally published on October 6, 2023. It has been updated to reflect recent developments.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, who is poised to seek the House speakership for a third time on Friday, has been a key figure in House GOP-led investigations and made a name for himself as a staunch ally of former President Donald Trump.\n\nJordan, who has served in Congress since 2007 and was endorsed by Trump in his bid for the speakership, serves as chairman of the powerful House Judiciary Committee. He has a longstanding reputation as a conservative agitator and helped found the hardline House Freedom Caucus.\n\nIn addition to chairing the Judiciary Committee, Jordan is also the chair of the select subcommittee on the \"weaponization\" of the federal government. When McCarthy announced a House GOP impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden, he said House Oversight Chairman James Comer would lead the effort in coordination with Jordan as Judiciary chair and Ways and Means Committee Chair Jason Smith.\n\nWhile Republicans say their investigative work is critical to informing the American public and ensuring accountability, Democrats frequently criticize Jordan as a hyper-partisan Trump defender and have accused him of using his perch to shield the former president in the run up to the 2024 presidential election.\n\nAs Jordan oversees key House GOP investigations, Democrats also point to the fact that he stonewalled in response to a subpoena for his testimony from the House select committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n\nJordan as well as Scalise both supported objections to electoral college results when Congress met to certify Joe Biden's presidential win on January 6.\n\nJordan has downplayed concerns that he may be too conservative for some of the more moderate members of the GOP.\n\n\"I think we are a conservative-center-right party. I think I'm the guy who can help unite that. My politics are entirely consistent with where conservatives and Republicans are across the country,\" Jordan told CNN's Manu Raju.\n\nCNN reported in 2020 that six former Ohio State University wrestlers said they were present when Jordan heard or responded to sexual misconduct complaints about team doctor Richard Strauss.\n\nJordan has emphatically denied that he knew anything about Strauss' abuse during his own years working at OSU, between 1987 and 1995. \"Congressman Jordan never saw any abuse, never heard about any abuse, and never had any abuse reported to him during his time as a coach at Ohio State,\" his congressional office said in 2018.\n\nOn Wednesday, Jordan received fewer votes than he did in the first round of voting: 22 Republicans opposed him, up from 20 the day before. Some Republicans have floated introducing a measure to empower interim Speaker Patrick McHenry until Jordan can coalesce enough support to win the speakership. All 212 Democrats voted for their party's leader, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries. The Ohio Republican could still force additional votes, just as McCarthy did in the 15 rounds it took him to be elected speaker in January.\n\nJordan initially ran against House Majority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana and was defeated last week in a closed-door vote by the conference. Scalise went on to become the GOP speaker nominee - but dropped out of the race abruptly after facing a bloc of hardened opposition.\n\nThe House GOP conference selected Jordan the next days as its new speaker-designee in a 124-81 vote over GOP Rep. Austin Scott of Georgia , who made a surprise last-minute bid. Jordan gained only 25 supporters compared to the previous vote when Scalise defeated Jordan, 113-99.\n\nJordan then called a second vote asking members if they would support him on the floor in an effort to see if that could shrink his opposition. That vote, which was cast by secret ballot, was 152-55 and laid out the long road ahead for Jordan's speakership bid to succeed.\n\nJordan and his allies made significant headway over the past several days, with the Ohio Republican pitching skeptical lawmakers one on one, but were still left with enough holdouts to threaten his bid for the speakership.\n\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.\n\nCNN's Haley Talbot, Annie Grayer and Curt Devine contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "The most important thing to know about Jim Jordan\n\nA version of this story appears in CNN's What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here .\n\nThere's one main thing to know about Rep. Jim Jordan , the Ohio Republican who does not yet have the votes to become speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\nHe's a passive skeptic of the 2020 presidential election results, but was an active election denier who appeared at a \"Stop the Steal\" rally in Pennsylvania and also appears to have played a role in former President Donald Trump's post-election strategy to overturn the results.\n\nJordan, to this day, does not acknowledge that Trump lost in 2020.\n\nRep. Ken Buck, a solid conservative from Colorado, said he might support Jordan if Jordan could simply admit in public that Trump lost the 2020 election.\n\nWhen reporters asked Jordan on Capitol Hill about Buck's request, Jordan ignored them and silently got into an elevator.\n\nThere are other important elements of Jordan's professional biography.\n\nJordan has played a very specific role in Congress, and it is not that of dealmaker, the main job requirement of modern House speakers. In fact, Jordan has never been the primary sponsor of a major piece of legislation that was enacted into law.\n\nThe Center for Effective Lawmaking ranks members of Congress based on the amount of major legislation that bears their fingerprints, and Jordan's rating is one of the lowest. Pushing for legislation is clearly not his priority.\n\nIf you've watched a House hearing meant to provide oversight of a Democratic administration, Jordan was probably involved.\n\nHe was a chief critic of Hillary Clinton during rounds of hearings related to the death of a US ambassador in Benghazi, Libya. More recently, he's among the top Republican voices building up a political dossier to imply, without direct evidence, that President Joe Biden sought to benefit from his son Hunter's career.\n\n\"This is a guy that has basically made it very clear that his whole goal isn't to govern, it's not to legislate, it's to destroy the Democrats,\" said CNN senior political commentator Adam Kinzinger , the Republican former congressman turned Republican critic, during an appearance on the network earlier this month.\n\nDuring the Trump administration, Jordan was Trump's chief defender during impeachment hearings preceding Trump's first impeachment in the House.\n\nKinzinger was one of the few Republican members of the House committee tasked with investigating the January 6, 2021, insurrection. The committee dissolved in January 2023, when Republicans took control of the House.\n\nRepublicans had tried to instill Jordan on the committee, but former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected the proposal because of concerns about Jordan's statements and actions.\n\nMembers of the House January 6 committee referred Jordan to the House Ethics Committee for refusing to comply with their subpoena to testify.\n\nBut it is notable that special counsel Jack Smith, who is investigating efforts to overturn the 2020 election, has not charged Jordan with any crime related to the election.\n\nHere are the key points made about Jordan in the January 6 report that the House committee released in late 2022:\n\nWhen Trump's then-attorney and henchman Rudy Giuliani wanted to continue to try to delay the counting of electoral votes after the storming of the Capitol on January 6, Jordan was among the lawmakers he called.\n\nWhen Sean Hannity, the Fox News personality, wanted to suggest that Trump stop talking about the election, he wrote a text to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and Jordan.\n\nJordan, according to the committee's report, \"participated in numerous post-election meetings in which senior White House officials, Rudolph Giuliani, and others, discussed strategies for challenging the election, chief among them claims that the election had been tainted by fraud.\"\n\nHe took part in a January 2, 2021, conference call with Trump and others about \"strategies for delaying the January 6th joint session.\"\n\nOne topic of discussion: \"issuing social media posts encouraging President Trump's supporters to 'march to the Capitol.'\"\n\nThe day before January 6, Jordan texted Meadows suggesting then-Vice President Mike Pence should \"should 'call out all the electoral votes that he believes are unconstitutional as no electoral votes at all.'\"\n\nPence, notably and to his credit, did not believe that any of the electoral votes were unconstitutional because there was no evidence of fraud.\n\nJordan was on the phone with Trump. The committee refers to Jordan speaking to Trump at least twice on January 6 and taking five calls from Giuliani after the insurrection, although three of the calls from Giuliani were not connected.\n\nAfter the insurrection, Jordan \"spoke with White House staff about the prospect of Presidential pardons for Members of Congress.\"\n\nJordan's elevation to the top position in the House and second in line for the presidential line of succession, should he be able to find the votes, would cement the election skeptic way of thinking as the default for Republicans .\n\nThat may not be a surprise since Republicans seem primed to elevate the election skeptic in chief, Trump, as their presidential nominee for the third time next year. But it does suggest that the party is not yet ready to move on from the last election, even as it prepares for the next one.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

      "text": "Jim Jordan's speakership bid ends after third lost vote\n\nOur live coverage has ended. Read more about today's developments in the posts below.\n\nHouse Republicans are once again scrambling with no clear path to elect a new speaker after voting to push Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan out of the race - the latest sign of the chaos and divisions that have engulfed the majority party and left the chamber in a state of paralysis.\n\nIf you are just tuning in, here's what you need to know about today's developments :\n\nHouse Majority Whip Tom Emmer plans to run an \"entirely positive\" campaign for speaker and \"won't attack his opponents,\" a source close to him says - betting it will be a welcome change in style, following weeks of nasty infighting in a bitterly divided GOP where some members have seen death threats over their speaker votes.\n\n\"Emmer plans to run an entirely positive speaker race and will not attack his opponents. He believes members will not respond well to negative campaigning after the past couple weeks,\" said the source familiar with Emmer's thinking.\n\nFormer House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is backing Emmer for speaker. McCarthy did not publicly endorse a candidate when Rep. Jim Jordan and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise vied for the nomination.\n\nHouse Republicans have shared the following schedule regarding next steps in the speaker race and election:\n\nThe timing of a floor vote is still unclear.\n\nRep. Kevin McCarthy is backing Rep. Tom Emmer for House speaker, sources tell CNN, delivering an early boost to his candidacy in what is shaping up to be a crowded race.\n\n\"He is the right person for the job. He can unite the conference. He understands the dynamics of the conference. He also understands what it takes to win and keep a majority,\" the former House speaker said of Emmer in a statement.\n\nMcCarthy did not publicly endorse a candidate when it was Rep. Jim Jordan and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise vying for the nomination.\n\nThe Republican-controlled 118th Congress has set many firsts .\n\nOn Jan. 3, former Speaker Kevin McCarthy became the first candidate in the majority party to lose a bid for the House speakership in 100 years. He won the gavel in the 15th round of voting, making his election the longest since before the Civil War.\n\nThen, on Oct. 3, McCarthy became the first House speaker in history to be removed by a motion to vacate.\n\nNow, as the House seeks a new speaker, the 118th is the first ever Congress to need two speaker elections with multiple ballots. Rep. Jim Jordan, who on Friday lost his third round of voting and later lost in a secret ballot, is no longer a nominee.\n\nHere is the history of multiple-ballot House speaker elections:\n\nThe White House offered reaction to the House Republicans' continued failure to elect a speaker after another loss for Rep. Jim Jordan Friday, calling out the \"chaotic infighting\" on the other side of Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Andrew Bates ticked off Biden's latest $105 billion national security supplemental funding request priorities as he contrasted those efforts with the ongoing dysfunction in the legislative branch.\n\n\"While Joe Biden fights to advance bipartisan legislation that will protect our national security interests - including in Israel and Ukraine - provide humanitarian assistance for innocent civilians in Gaza, deliver critical border funding, compete with China, and grow our economy, House Republicans are somehow still fighting with each other,\" Bates said.\n\nHe continued, \"House Republicans need to end their chaotic infighting and their competitions to out-extreme one another, and instead join President Biden in working on urgent priorities for American families shared by both parties in Congress.\"\n\nThe Biden campaign is also piling on, saying that House Republicans have \"humiliated themselves and failed the American people.\"\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise will not run again for speaker, according to a source.\n\nScalise had dropped out of the speaker's race earlier this month after House Republicans failed to coalesce behind him.\n\nTexas GOP Rep. Pete Sessions is also making calls to members telling them he is running for speaker, a lawmaker who received a call from Sessions tells CNN.\n\nSessions is among the growing list of members who are throwing their hat in the ring for speaker now that the field is wide open.\n\nRep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana, the vice conference chair and Judiciary member, is making calls for speaker, according to a source.\n\nRep. Byron Donalds is running for speaker after Jim Jordan's bid ended Friday with a third failed ballot vote, his spokesperson said.\n\nWith the GOP speakership now once again up for grabs, here's a list of potential candidates and where they stand on getting in the race. They have until noon ET Sunday to file.\n\nConfirmed candidates:\n\nConsidering running:\n\nRep. Tom Emmer, the House GOP majority whip, is making calls to run for speaker according to two sources, including one close to Emmer.\n\nGOP Rep. Jack Bergman will run for speaker after Jim Jordan's bid ended Friday with a third failed ballot vote, his spokesperson said.\n\nGOP Reps. Kevin Hern and Austin Scott are both seeking the speakership as well.\n\nRep. Chip Roy, a staunch supporter of Rep. Jim Jordan, called it a \"mistake\" for the Republican conference to end Jordan's speakership bid.\n\n\"I supported Jim Jordan wholeheartedly, I think it was a mistake for the Republican conference to just walk away from arguably the most popular Republican in the Republican party. We shouldn't have done that, we just did, so now we got to go back and figure out what we're doing,\" he told CNN's Manu Raju.\n\nRoy also deflected when pressed by CNN's Manu Raju on how the ongoing chaos reflects on the Republican party.\n\n\"I think having the American people be able to see how we are wrestling with the tough decisions and what we're trying to do, and doing it with intensity and doing it because we care about this country? I mean, God bless all of these people that put their names forward, all of the stuff that we're wrestling with, because it's a hell of a lot better than the way the rest of the world has always done it. God bless,\" he told CNN.\n\nGOP Rep. Kevin Hern told CNN he plans to run for House speaker after Jim Jordan's bid ended Friday with a third failed ballot vote.\n\n\"We just got to work hard. It's different. Clearly I don't have the longevity in Congress that Jim or Steve had so there's different relationships there. I've spent 25 years in leadership roles,\" Hern said when asked how he plans to get 217 votes, adding he'll work \"hard\" to get people on his side.\n\nHouse Republicans left this afternoon's conference meeting frustrated and calling for reflection after Rep. Jim Jordan's speakership bid ended and as the chamber remains paralyzed.\n\nRep. Dusty Johnson, an even-keeled and pragmatic Republican, was especially furious as he attacked those who voted to oust former speaker Kevin McCarthy and called for a Republican not driven by ambition to step forward and lead the conference.\n\n\"Clearly there is yet another void we are going to have a couple more days of chaos as we try to get a sense of what's next. To me, it reminds me of how incredibly irresponsible it was for 208 Democrats and 8 Republicans to put this House into absolute chaos without any kind of a plan for how we are going to move forward,\" Congressman Dusty Johnson told CNN's Manu Raju. \"We need to go find a leader.\"\n\nJohnson added: \"We really do need somebody to step forward, somebody who is mission driven. Somebody who is focused on doing something rather than just being something. Blind ambition has distorted this process enough.\"\n\nWhen Rep. Nancy Mace tried to call out Johnson while he was speaking with CNN, he fired back by slamming the eight Republicans who ousted McCarthy, saying that it's been \"a long time\" since Mace has done \"anything productive to move forward this broader team.\"\n\n\"America's got real problems. And this is a time where we need people who are interested in problem solving, not self-aggrandizement,\" he continued. \"It is time for big boys and big girls to stop with the nonsense and get back to work for the United States.\"\n\nAsked if anyone can get the votes to lead the conference, Johnson said: \"There are people in that room who can get the votes. They have not thought of themselves as the guy or the girl yet, but this country, this Republican conference we are going to turn our eyes to them and we need them to step up.\"\n\nRep. Austin Scott said the whole saga makes the Republican conference \"look bad\" as he called it a \"dangerous game being played.\"\n\n\"It was a dangerous game being played, the consequences were real for the country. If men were angels we wouldn't need the government as you know. But men aren't angels and we need the United States House of Representatives open,\" he told CNN. \"There's a tremendous amount of resentment among the different groups in the conference. The resentment is something we've got to work through.\"\n\nRep. Byron Donalds did not rule out a speakership bid himself, saying he needs to reflect on a path forward.\n\n\"What I'm going to do is frankly sit down, think, because we have got to get our business together and that's going to be my entire focus,\" he told CNN's Manu Raju.\n\nInterim House Speaker Patrick McHenry said Republicans will gather Monday for a candidate forum with elections on Tuesday, arguing that neither Steve Scalise nor Jim Jordan had enough time to gather support for their candidacies.\n\n\"House Republicans will return on Monday at 6:30pm for a candidate forum, followed by an election process on Tuesday morning at 9 a.m.,\" he said as he left the meeting that removed Jordan as their speaker nominee.\n\nMcHenry explained further:\n\n\"The reason why I made that decision is we need space and time for candidates to talk to other members. It's fair to say that Leader Scalise wasn't given adequate time. He had 24 hours to campaign. I don't think that was right for him. Our nominee Jordan was given a little more time - not right for him. The conference made a decision that we're going to move forward with a new speaker nominee today. But the space and time for a reset is, I think, an important thing for House Republicans.\"\n\nHe said he hopes it can be resolved in a week.\n\nGOP Rep. Austin Scott, who launched a last minute bid against Jim Jordan last week but quickly dropped out, is running for speaker again now that the field is wide open, his spokesperson told CNN.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan said \"we need to come together\" to find the next House speaker after again failing to win the speakership Friday.\n\n\"We need to come together and figure out who our speaker is going to be. I'm going to work as hard as I can to help that individual so that we can go help the American people,\" he said.\n\nAfter the House floor vote, Jordan lost a secret ballot by the GOP conference on whether he should stay in the race or drop out, sources told CNN, and he accepted the results after they were announced.\n\nJordan said that he's going to get back to work and it's \"important we do unite\" to get to work for Americans.\n\n\"We've got several depositions lined up next week in the Judiciary Committee, work that we need to do for the American people and our investigative work, so we'll go back to work there. But it's important we do unite, let's figure out who that individual is, get behind them, and get to work for the American people,\" he said.\n\nJordan also said he appreciated what he experienced over the past three weeks.\n\n\"I appreciated getting to work with everyone, talk with everyone. I got to know members in our conference that I didn't really know that well over the last three weeks,\" he said.\n\nFormer House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said that \"unfortunately Jim is no longer going to be the nominee\" after the conference's vote to remove Jim Jordan as their Speaker designee.\n\n\"We'll have to go back to the drawing board. What history will look at the crazy eights led by Gaetz, the amount of damage they've done to this party, this country, is insurmountable. I've never seen this amount of damage done with just a few people for their own personalities,\" McCarthy said.\n\n\"And really it's astonishing to me, and we're in a very bad position as a party,\" he said. \"I'm concerned about where we go from here.\"\n\nHouse Majority Whip Tom Emmer said it's \"too soon\" when asked if he was getting in the race.\n\nA number of House GOP members left the closed-door meeting where Jim Jordan lost a secret ballot vote feeling more confused about the path forward and who is best to lead them.\n\n\"We're back to square one\" GOP Dusty Johnson told CNN.\n\nJohnson said the ideal candidate is someone who is not at all interested in the job.\n\n\"I am hopeful that we're going to find somebody who has probably never envisioned themselves in this role. Somebody who has been more interested in doing something rather than being something. We're going to need a real leader to step up\" Johnson said.\n\nLaying out the stakes of what stepping up to lead this House Republican conference takes, Johnson added that the candidate has to \"understand this is probably the last job they're going to have in politics.\"\n\nHomeland Security Committee Chair Mark Green told CNN he is weighing a run for House speaker, has been encouraged to do so, and will make a decision tonight.\n\nHe's going to talk to his family, and Freedom Caucus will meet today.\n\nAfter the vote was announced that he lost, Jim Jordan stood up and said he accepted the results, multiple lawmakers told CNN.\n\nGOP Rep. Russell Fry told CNN that Jordan said \"he appreciated everyone's support throughout the process that that he respected the decision.\"\n\nGOP Rep. Dan Bishop told CNN \"He didn't say the words I'm withdrawing but it was implicit in everything that he said.\"\n\nRep. Dusty Johnson told reporters that \"it's going to be another couple of difficult days,\" as they try and figure out who is going to be the new nominee for speaker.\n\n\"We're going to get it done, it's just going to take a little longer,\" he added.\n\nAsked who he thinks will be in the running, he said, \"I think we need to give people a little bit of time to mourn the developments, and then we need to get people some time to think about what they could offer the House and our country.\"\n\nMultiple members emerging from the closed door GOP meeting say they will move on from Rep. Jim Jordan. They'll have a candidate forum Monday night at 6:30 pm EST and new candidates have until Sunday to declare their candidacy.\n\n\"Jim Jordan is out of the race. We're supposed to come back for a candidate forum on Monday at 6:30,\" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene told reporters.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise said the House is leaving until Monday when they will \"start over\"\n\n\"Monday we're going to come back and start over,\" he said as he left conference.\n\nJim Jordan lost a secret ballot vote of the House GOP behind closed doors, sources tell CNN.\n\nRep. Barry Moore had said that members were taking a \"yes\" or \"no\" vote in their conference meeting on whether to keep Jordan as their nominee for speaker.\n\nRep. Barry Moore says that members are taking a \"yes\" or \"no\" vote in their conference meeting on whether to keep Jordan as their nominee for speaker.\n\n\"Just to leave Jim as our nominee or to figure out something else,\" he said, noting they were told to \"check yes or no.\"\n\nAsked what would happen if Jordan didn't get a majority, Moore said he'd assume they'd need a new candidate. \"I assume we'd have to nominate somebody else at that point, I don't know at this point right now,\" he said.\n\nMoore also said that they are having attendance issues, as some members leave town for the weekend.\n\n\"I heard there are some people on some airplanes going home. That's frustrating for those of us who want to get the job done. So yeah, we need to be here fighting,\" he told reporters.\n\nNew York GOP Rep. Nick LaLota told CNN that Jordan has \"inched\" toward him and the other New York Republicans who want certain guarantees in exchange for their vote.\n\n\"We've spoken and he's inched towards our direction, and we're willing to compromise but I still think we're far away,\" LaLota told CNN. \"He or any other speaker needs to find a way to keep the government open, while pursuing the commitments to America - securing the border and reducing debt.\"\n\nLaLota also said it was \"predictable\" that the GOP would end up in the current stalemate.\n\n\"Well, I think that the path down which eight Republicans and 210 Democrats put us was unfortunate, there's a lot of responsibility. We all knew we were gonna get here. It was predictable that nobody could climb a 217 vote mountain in just a couple of weeks,\" he said.\n\nReps. Chavez-DeRemer and Drew Ferguson, who both voted against Jordan on the floor, also told CNN that they aren't changing their minds.\n\nSome House Republicans who have been voting for Rep. Jim Jordan for speaker insisted that they still support him, even after 25 of their House GOP colleagues voted for other candidates on the third ballot.\n\nRep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina said he has been encouraging Jordan.\n\n\"I told him that on the floor. He's got a path to victory, and just keep voting until we get there, and let the American people see what's going on here. Stand up, like we're doing, and casting your vote,\" Norman said.\n\nRep. George Santos said Jordan has to make the decision on whether it's time for him to drop out - but noted he is still behind him.\n\n\"If he thinks it's time for him to step down that's on him. I still support him,\" said Santos.\n\nHe added that he expects the members will have \"real, open conversations,\" during their conference meeting and argued that the eight members who voted to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy should not \"auto-censure\" themselves in a bid to appease holdouts.\n\n\"Some of my colleagues are circulating letters that they're gonna auto-censure themselves. That's not what's needed here. We need to come together as a team, have a real conversation in there, as uncomfortable as it is, we're all adults,\" said Santos. \"So that we can figure out what's the path is for all the come to the floor and vote for him for speaker.\"\n\nTwo House Republicans who voted against Rep. Jim Jordan for speaker during the third ballot said they are holding firm, and argued that the conference has other options.\n\n\"We're still getting more votes every time,\" said Rep. Don Bacon. \"It's time for Mr. Jordan, who I have no personal animus towards, it's time for him to step down. Let's start with a clean slate, with no baggage. We have baggage going back with Steve Scalise's election and Kevin's and he was a part of that. So it's time to move on.\"\n\nRep. Brian Fitzpatrick, flipped and voted against Jordan for the first time on this vote, said it is Jordan's decision on if he's ready to drop out. \"That's his choice. You saw how I voted today,\" he said.\n\nBacon and Fitzpatrick both floated Speaker Pro Tempore Patrick McHenry as an alternative. \"Patrick McHenry doesn't want it, but he would be great,\" said Bacon.\n\nFitzpatrick added, \"I think Patrick McHenry is the perfect person to just get us through the year and possibly the cycle.\"\n\nThe Pennsylvania Republican also went after the eight Republicans and the Democrats who voted to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, arguing that they should be \"held accountable.\"\n\n\"I hope you all are asking the question of the eight and the 208 that put us in this position. Because they are the reason we're here. Everybody needs to be abundantly clear that we had a speaker who put a two party bill on the floor to avert a government shutdown, and he was punished for it,\" said Fitzpatrick. \"That is the worst message you can send to America, the worst, and every single person that voted to punish bipartisanship ought to be held accountable.\"\n\nRep. Brian Fitzpatrick - who flipped his vote against Jordan in the third ballot - told CNN the House needs to get back up and running and predicted more opposition against Jordan if there is another ballot.\n\n\"I just think we've got to get the government open,\" he said. \"We cannot have an entire branch of government offline when the world is on fire.\"\n\nFitzpatrick said there should be a vote \"immediately\" to empower interim speaker Patrick McHenry. He also argued the focus should be on getting a majority of the House, not just a majority of the conference.\n\n\"You can go for 218 in the conference or 218 in the Congress. I choose the Congress because that's what's representative of the whole country,\" he said.\n\nFitzpatrick said, \"I think we need to move to Patrick McHenry,\" but said \"that's his choice\" when asked by CNN's Manu Raju what he would say to Jordan if he stays in the race.\n\nFitzpatrick said he's not worried about potential political backlash, but that the standoff over the speaker is \"bad for America.\"\n\nCongresswoman Jen Kiggans also told Raju \"yes\" it's time for Jordan to drop out.\n\nThe House GOP is voting now on secret ballot election on whether Rep. Jim Jordan should stay or drop out, according to Rep. Troy Nehls.\n\nRep. Ken Buck's office said it was a \"mistake\" that he was listed on the letter from other holdouts, saying they'd be willing to accept whatever consequences if holdouts agree to back Jim Jordan for speaker.\n\nOf the eight Republicans who voted to remove Kevin McCarthy for speaker, Buck is the only one opposed to Jordan for speaker.\n\n\"This was a mistake. Congressman Buck had not agreed to sign this letter and his name has since been removed. His position remains unchanged,\" a spokesman for Buck said.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan again defended his choice to continue running for speaker after 25 Republicans voted against him on the third ballot.\n\n\"Even Speaker McCarthy took a dip and then came back,\" he said, when asked if it is time to get a new nominee. \"You guys said we were going to lose 15 to 30. We lost a couple and we had a few people miss it,\" he added.\n\nJordan continued, \"We're gonna go talk to conference right now, listen to our colleagues.\"\n\nAsked about several of his supporters saying it wasn't looking good for him, Jordan replied, \"we'll find out.\"\n\nHouse Republicans are now meeting following Rep. Jim Jordan's third failed bid for the speaker's gavel.\n\nJordan has been losing support with each vote: There were 25 House Republicans who voted for someone other than Jordan, who could only lose five votes today due to the roll call vote absences. He lost 22 votes on the second round of voting and 20 on the first.\n\nMeanwhile, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer said he will support Jordan \"all the way through.\"\n\nDemocratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Friday, \"It's time for House Republicans to embrace bipartisanship and abandon extremism once and for all.\"\n\n\"That is your only way out of the House Republican chaos and dysfunction,\" he said. \"It's my understanding that you have several extreme MAGA Republicans on the other side of the aisle ... saying they will only ever vote for Jim Jordan. And if that in fact is the case, it's an additional data point that there is only one way out.\"\n\nJeffries said he has still not talked with anyone on the Republican side about some sort of agreement, saying \"a leader to talk to is going to have to emerge\" first.\n\n\"I have not had any conversations with the other side of the aisle,\" Jeffries said.\n\n\"As we can see on the House floor, there are different parts of the House Republican conference who have rejected the extremism of Jim Jordan. So conversations hopefully will intensify today or perhaps continue through the weekend, and get us to a place where we can reopen the House no later than Monday,\" he added.\n\nWhen pressed on that date, Jeffries waved his hands: \"It's possible.\"\n\nGOP Rep. Matt Gaetz said the eight Republicans that voted to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy sent a letter to their colleagues encouraging them to vote for Jim Jordan for speaker and that they are willing to \"accept some consequence\" in order to get them to do so.\n\n\"If what these holdouts need is a pound of our flesh, we're willing to give it to them in order to see the election of Jordan for Speaker,\" Gaetz said standing alongside GOP Reps. Crane, Good and Tim Burchett just after the failed vote.\n\n\"If what people need is to see the eight of us rapped on the knuckles in order to get onto the business of governing, what we're saying is we're open minded,\" Gaetz added.\n\nIn terms of specific consequences, Gaetz said they \"are willing to accept censure, sanction, suspension, removal from the Republican conference, we of course will remain Republicans, we will continue to vote with Republicans on Republican principles.\"\n\nMany holdouts have expressed that their hesitation lies with the strong arm tactics used. Gaetz insisted that was the work of outside groups and not Jordan.\n\n\"We know Jim Jordan, I've worked with Jim Jordan on the House Judiciary Committee. He's not a person who leads to strong arm tactics. I think Jim Jordan has been unfairly blamed by some for the tactics of outside groups that Jim Jordan has no control over,\" Gaetz said.\n\nThe eight that voted to remove McCarthy said they don't support removing Patrick McHenry as Pro Tem. \"Speaker McHenry Pro Tem deserves credit for resisting calls to expand the pro tem role beyond how it is contemplated in the Constitution. Patrick McHenry has earned our respect for having abided by the limitations on the power of the pro tem position and for that you should be commended.\"\n\nJim Jordan said he is not backing down even after 25 Republicans - the most so far - voted against him on the third speaker ballot.\n\n\"You guys said we're gonna lose 15 to 30,\" he told CNN. \"We only lost a couple, we had a couple of absents who would have been for us.\"\n\nJordan added that he will keep trying to get more votes during their conference meeting at 1 p.m. ET.\n\n\"We're gonna try. I think so. And you know, we have conference in like an hour,\" he said.\n\nJim Jordan again failed to win the speakership during the third round of voting.\n\nThere were 25 House Republicans who voted for someone other than Jordan - a higher number of GOP votes against him than in the first two failed votes in a sign that opposition to his bid is growing. Reps. Steve Scalise, Kevin McCarthy, Byron Donalds, Patrick McHenry, Mike Garcia, Bruce Westerman and Tom Emmer, as well as former Rep. Lee Zeldin all received votes.\n\nIn the first round of voting, 20 House Republicans voted for someone else. In the second round, that number rose to 22.\n\nHere's are the Republicans who did not vote for Jordan in the third round, and who they voted for instead:\n\nRep. Troy Nehls, who has voted for Jim Jordan in the last three rounds, told CNN he will vote for former President Donald Trump if there's another speaker ballot.\n\n\"My next vote will be for Donald J. Trump,\" he told CNN.\n\nNehls' comments are the latest indication there is a recognition among many Republicans that Jordan doesn't have the votes.\n\n\"You guys can see what's happening on the television with the votes. I just don't think he has the votes and I've talked to some of the 20 or so that have said they're not moving,\" he said.\n\nFormer House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said \"we're in a very bad place\" after Jim Jordan again failed to win the speakership during the third round of voting.\n\n\"I think we'll go to conference here shortly and see which direction we go in,\" McCarthy said while talking to reporters following the third vote for speaker.\n\n\"It's a problem for the party that we're in this place to begin with. And it's 4 percent, eight members here, crazy members led by Gaetz, that put us in a bad situation,\" McCarthy said when asked if it's a problem for the GOP for Jordan to continue on without a path to the speakership.\n\nMcCarthy said before walking away that he thinks they will conference at 1 pm ET.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan, a Republican from Ohio, again failed to win the speakership in a third round of voting.\n\nThe Conservative Partnership Institute - a group headed up by former Freedom Caucus Chair Mark Meadows, who is Jim Jordan's close ally - has been an active player in the intense, outside pressure campaign aimed at boosting Jordan's speakership candidacy, sources tell CNN.\n\nCPI has been coordinating calls and helping strategize with right-wing activists about ways to apply pressure on holdouts and whip up support for Jordan, sources say.\n\nJordan has denounced the threats and harassment some of his detractors are facing, and has denied any involvement in the right-wing intimidation tactics. But CPI is very closely tied to the Freedom Caucus, which even holds their weekly meetings at CPI's headquarters.\n\nThere's growing anger among the holdouts over the bullying they are facing from some of Jordan's allies on the right, and they say they are disappointed with Jordan's response - which is only hardening their opposition.\n\nRep. Don Bacon tells CNN: \"Jordan and his team are in denial over the threats and harassment his supporters are doing. Jordan's response has been tepid.\"\n\nRep. Jim Jordan appears to have lost more Republican votes in his third round of voting than he did on the previous two ballots.\n\nVoting is still ongoing, but so far, Jordan has lost 23 GOP votes. He lost 22 Republican votes on the second round of voting Wednesday and 20 on the first Tuesday.\n\nJordan could only afford to lose five votes from Republicans and still have the votes needed to win the speaker's gavel today.\n\nRemember: Members can change their votes up until the vote concludes.\n\nNew Jersey Rep. Tom Kean switched his vote on the third ballot from Rep. Jim Jordan to former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, saying that \"it has become evident that Chairman Jordan does not and will not have the votes to become Speaker,\" on X , formerly known as Twitter.\n\n\"I will cast my next vote for Kevin McCarthy.\"\n\nIn the third round of voting, Rep. Jim Jordan appears to again fall short on votes.\n\nJordan could only afford to lose five votes from Republicans in order to obtain the votes necessary to win the speaker's gavel. He's already lost five votes.\n\nRemember: Members can change their votes up until the vote concludes.\n\nRep. Katherine Clark nominated House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries for speaker in a third ballot.\n\n\"212 is our call for a speaker who will secure liberty, justice and opportunity for everyone. Well, the unanimous call of 212 House Democrats has been answered by our nominee for speaker, the gentleman from Brooklyn, the leader of our House Democratic Caucus, the honorable Hakeem Jeffries,\" Clark said.\n\nClark said Rep. Jim Jordan is \"disconnected\" from the American people and their values.\n\n\"MAGA extremism is designed to divide, and it has broken the Republican party. Their nominee's vision is a direct attack on the freedom and the rights of the American people,\" Clark said.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan can only lose 5 GOP votes due to the roll call vote absences. There are currently 2 GOP absences and 4 Democratic absences.\n\nAccording to the roll call there are 427 members present - which means Jordan needs 214, or half the total plus one. He can now only lose five votes with 219 Republicans voting.\n\nA 216-216 tie would trigger a revote.\n\nBut remember: Anyone who missed the roll call can still vote in the speaker vote - which would change the math on how many votes are needed.\n\nFormer House Speaker Kevin McCarthy nominated Rep. Jim Jordan for the speakership ahead of a third vote.\n\n\"Jim Jordan is an effective legislator. To legislate is about more than the name on the bill. It's about reaching compromise and working long hours behind the scenes to get the job done,\" McCarthy said causing uproar in the chamber.\n\nHe also pointed to Jordan's legislative history, while comparing it to Democrats.\n\n\"As the leader of the Judiciary Committee, Jim has passed more bills through the House in just three years than the entire Democrat leadership team that has a collective 28 years in Congress,\" McCarthy said.\n\nThe California Republican also said he called freshman members on Jordan's committee and asked them what they thought of Jordan. \"Jim empowers every member of Judiciary to pursue what interests them,\" McCarthy read off as one of the responses.\n\nThe House is now starting its third round of voting to elect a speaker.\n\nVoting will be done verbally with members called by name alphabetically and then stating their choice for speaker. Members can also choose to vote present. If a member doesn't vote, they will get a chance to vote at the end of the roll call.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan was unable to secure the gavel on the first and second vote. During the first round of voting on Tuesday, 20 House Republicans voted against Jordan. On Wednesday, that number rose to 22 , showing that the opposition against the candidate has grown. There were four new Republican votes against Jordan and two that flipped into his column.\n\nRemember: Members can change their vote until the gavel comes down.\n\nEven some of Rep. Jim Jordan's supporters are warning there's no path for him to win the speakership and urged against the idea of forcing more votes.\n\nRep. Troy Nehls said he will continue voting for Jordan today - but didn't commit beyond that, and he said he wants to start nominating Trump after that.\n\nHe also said that while he doesn't think Jordan is involved in the threats against those Republicans who have voted against him or outside pressure campaign , but said the concerns about personal safety are a reality right now and suggested it's a reason to stop continuing with failed votes.\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Dan Crenshaw - who said he will still back Jordan - said he recommends against a \"flurry of votes\" and said the opposition isn't budging. \"You can take that to the grave,\" Crenshaw said.\n\nHe urged Jordan to reassess, \"step back and take a breather.\"\n\nIt's a sign that the opposition - and pressure to drop out - is only going to grow if Jordan keeps pushing ahead.\n\nFormer Speaker Kevin McCarthy called the fight for the speakership \"chaotic\" ahead of the third ballot.\n\n\"We need to elect a speaker. This is chaotic. This is not the way things should be handled,\" said McCarthy.\n\nHe also went after Rep. Matt Gaetz and the other members that voted to oust him.\n\n\"As you know, I was opposed to the crazy eights led by Gaetz with all the Democrats voting to shut down one branch of government,\" he said. \"And this is where we are today now. So let's get our way out of this and start governing for the American people.\"\n\nMembers of the House are now nominating representatives from their party for the speakership.\n\nFormer House Speaker Kevin McCarthy nominated Jordan for the speakership.\n\nRep. Roger Williams of Texas told CNN that he doesn't believe speaker designate Jim Jordan should keep the House voting over the weekend.\n\n\"I'm not advising Congressman Jordan, okay? But I know I want to go home. I want to go home and see my family. I've got a business I gotta check into and most importantly, I've got a granddaughter who's gonna be five years old. That's pretty important. So I'm not advising him,\" Williams said.\n\nThe Texas Republican said he plans to keep supporting Jordan but that if he loses more votes he should reconsider his position.\n\nCalifornia Rep. Mike Garcia said he's sticking with his vote for Jim Jordan but that if the Ohio Republican can't reach the necessary 217 votes to claim the gavel, \"at some point we're going to have to look at the trend here, and see what the conversations are.\"\n\n\"If the count is getting worse and worse for him, I don't think that's a great idea. If it keeps eroding we've got to probably hit pause and caucus as a conference and figure out a Plan F through L. Whatever we're on now,\" he told Manu Raju as he headed to the floor.\n\nGOP Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart, who has been consistent in his opposition to Jim Jordan for speaker, told reporters ahead of the third speaker vote that the opposition to Jordan will not change and only grow.\n\n\"It's not rocket science, right? It's math, basic math. That hasn't changed that won't change. And so the issue is, what does he want to do? Does he just want to be doing this for the sake of doing it?\" Diaz-Balart said.\n\nResponding to claims that Jordan's team doesn't know what the holdouts want, Diaz-Balart, who met with Jordan yesterday said, \"I think, you know, everybody knows what the reasons are. Mr. Jordan knows what the reasons are. And so I think we're beyond all of this as to kind of pointing fingers and everything else. It's time to move forward.\"\n\nAsked to respond to claims that Jordan should get as many rounds of votes as Kevin McCarthy did, Diaz-Balart said it was, \"totally different circumstances anyways, but we're already basically there. I mean, we've been doing this now for a while.\"\n\nOn his way to the floor for another speaker's vote, Rep. Jim Jordan said he thinks he can flip more members and earn support from holdouts.\n\n\"I think so. We'll find out,\" he told reporters.\n\nAsked what he would do if they continued to lose votes, Jordan replied, \"You all said we were going to lose 10, 12, 15 votes last time. You said the same last time. We actually picked up a few votes lost a few it's been back and forth.\"\n\nJordan fared worse on his second ballot Wednesday, with 22 Republicans voting against him, compared to the 20 who did not support him on the first ballot on Tuesday.\n\nJordan added that \"there's no place\" for the death threats that members who voted against him have been receiving.\n\n\"There's no place for that. We've been totally against that,\" said Jordan.\n\nRep. Ralph Norman, a Jim Jordan ally, said that he thinks Jordan should go all day and night with speaker votes, but acknowledged Jordan won't be able to flip a dozen holdouts.\n\nPressed by CNN on what the end game is, Norman said he thinks pressure from the \"American people\" and keeping the issue in the spotlight will help convince holdouts to change their minds.\n\nAs some Texas Republicans are trying to get House Budget Chair Jodey Arrington to run for speaker, Arrington told CNN, \"I am supporting Jim Jordan 100 percent. As long as he's in the race, I'm all behind him. I hope that this works out better for him.\"\n\nThe House is starting a call of the House, a roll call of present members.\n\nNOTE: This is not the speaker vote - that vote will come after.\n\nHowever, this vote remains significant because it gives the first glimpse to determine how many members are present and who is absent. Both are key factors in determining the majority vote threshold for the speaker election.\n\nThe House is reconvening for a third House speaker vote as Rep. Jim Jordan scrambles for support in his bid.\n\nDuring the first round of voting on Tuesday, 20 House Republicans voted against Jordan. On Wednesday, that number rose to 22 , showing that the opposition against the candidate has grown. There were four new Republican votes against Jordan and two that flipped into his column.\n\nSee the Republicans who voted against Jordan in each ballot.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said Rep. Jim Jordan is a \"clear and present danger\" to democracy ahead of the third vote for House speaker.\n\n\"At every step of the way, Republicans have rejected bipartisanship and embraced extremism. Jim Jordan is a clear and present danger to our democracy,\" Jeffries said.\n\n\"He wants to end social security as we know it. He wants to end medicare as we know it - doesn't believe that President Biden was elected in 2020. That's disrespectful to the American people,\" Jeffries added.\n\nJeffries called Jordan the \"poster child for MAGA extremism\" and called for Republicans to join Democrats in finding bipartisanship.\n\n\"We are saying to our traditional Republican colleagues - good men and women on the other side of the aisle - end the attachment to the extremist Jim Jordan and join with Democrats in finding a bipartisan path forward,\" Jeffries said.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan can only lose 3 GOP votes due to the absence of GOP Rep. Derrick Van Orden, who a source confirms is in Israel.\n\nWith his absence, the total voting tally is 432, which still requires 217 for Jordan to prevail (or one more than half of the number of members voting). That means he can now only lose three votes instead of four.\n\nIn a news conference Friday morning, Rep. Jim Jordan made it clear he has no immediate plans to abandon his bid for House speaker.\n\n\"We need to get to work for the American people. We need to do what we said we were going to do, we need to do what we told them we were going to do when they elected us and put us in office, and frankly, we can't do that if the House isn't open. We can't open the House until we get a speaker,\" Jordan said, as the House entered day 17 without a speaker.\n\n\"The quickest way to get all this working is to get a speaker elected. That's what I'm hoping we can do today,\" he added.\n\nDespite the pep rally-style speech, Jordan gave ahead of the expected third round vote at 10 a.m. ET for his flailing speakership bid, he did not lay out a clear plan for his path forward.\n\n\"The plan this weekend is to get a speaker elected to the House of Representatives as soon as possible,\" he told CNN's Lauren Fox when pressed for specifics on how many rounds he will go.\n\nWeekend votes are expected but given his plans have changed constantly this week, there is a lot still up in the air. The pressure he will feel when he keeps bleeding votes, as is expected, will be immense.\n\nHe made the case for selecting a speaker as soon as possible. \"We need to get back to our committee work. And frankly, we need to continue the oversight work that I think is so darn important.\"\n\nAdditionally, he said the House needs to help Israel. There was no mention of Ukraine.\n\nThe House remains effectively frozen as long as there is no elected speaker - a perilous situation as Congress faces an impending government funding deadline and the threat of a shutdown.\n\nCNN's Clare Foran, Melanie Zanona, Haley Talbot, Annie Grayer and Lauren Fox contributed reporting to this post.\n\nOpposition to Rep. Jim Jordan continues to grow within the Republican Party despite his efforts to flip holdouts over the last couple of days, according to multiple GOP members who oppose his nomination.\n\nJordan lost 22 votes on the second ballot Thursday, and one Republican predicted he could lose around 29 votes as the House expects to hold a third ballot Friday morning.\n\nThe House is gearing up for another showdown on the floor Friday with a third speaker vote expected, the latest sign that Jim Jordan is not backing down even though he lacks the 217 votes needed to secure the speakership. There have been two failed votes so far.\n\nAs the Ohio Republican works to inject some life back into his flailing speakership bid, three sources told CNN he has made some progress with a small bloc of holdouts: New York Republicans.\n\nIf Jordan does win them over, that would still not be nearly enough to secure the speakership, given that 22 Republicans voted against him on the second ballot and more are expected to oppose him on the third ballot. But Jordan is hoping to show some sign of progress ahead of the next vote planned for Friday.\n\nRead more about the speaker's race.\n\nRepublican Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio has so far failed to clinch the House speakership in two rounds of voting.\n\nOn Tuesday, 20 Republicans voted against his candidacy - far more than the handful he could afford to lose given the party's narrow majority in Congress. The congressman fared worse in a Wednesday vote, with 22 Republicans voting against him .

      "text": "Trump complimented Jim Jordan's physique and said his ears 'have something going on' during rambling post-impeachment speech\n\nPresident Donald Trump singled out Rep. Jim Jordan, an Ohio Republican, complimenting the congressman's physical fitness during a White House speech celebrating the end of the impeachment trial on Thursday.\n\n\"When I first got to know Jim, I'd say, huh, he never wears a jacket - he's obviously very proud of his body,\" Trump said.\n\nJordan was a collegiate wrestler and an assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State University in the late 1980s and early 1990s. During Jordan's time coaching at Ohio State, dozens of wrestlers on his team allege they were sexually abused by the team doctor. Jordan has denied knowing about the abuse, even as some players said he was aware.\n\nThe president joked that the exercise machines in the congressional gym \"start burning\" when Jordan uses them.\n\n\"Those ears have something going on there,\" Trump said of Jordan, possibly referring to cauliflower ear . \"This guy was a champion top, top wrestler.\"\n\nDuring his Thursday remarks, Trump complimented and thanked a host of other Republican lawmakers who stood by him and fought the impeachment charges on his behalf.\n\nThe Republican-controlled Senate voted to acquit Trump of both charges against him following a bitter impeachment trial.\n\nTrump framed his impeachment as a \"war,\" accused Democrats of treating him \"unbelievably unfairly,\" and blamed \"dirty\" intelligence officials, including former FBI Director James Comey, for the way he was treated.\n\n\"It was evil, it was corrupt, it was dirty cops,\" Trump said. \"It was leakers, liars, and this should never, ever happen to another president, ever.

      "text": "What Mark Zuckerberg really said - and didn't say - in that letter to Congress\n\nHere's a head-scratcher: Why did Mark Zuckerberg just send Congress a letter admitting that Meta has screwed up in the past?\n\nI have a hunch.\n\nBut before you can get into that, you have to look at what Zuckerberg actually said in his letter to Jim Jordan , the Republican lawmaker who has spent years trying to find evidence of an anti-conservative bias in Big Tech.\n\nVery briefly:\n\nIn online conservative circles, starting with Jordan himself, Zuckerberg's letter/mea culpa is supposed to be a very big deal: a \"Big win for free speech,\" as Jordan's judiciary committee tweeted .\n\nBut if you take a closer look at what Zuckerberg said, and didn't say, you may come to the conclusion I've reached: that Zuckerberg very carefully gave Jordan just enough to claim a political victory - but without getting Meta in any further trouble while it defends itself against a federal antitrust suit .\n\nLet's dig in. The first item in the letter, about the Biden White House pressuring Facebook during the pandemic, is by far the most politically meaningful.\n\nFor years, conservatives like Jordan have argued that Big Tech companies like Facebook have an anti-Republican bias. And here, finally, you have a Big Tech CEO saying a Democratic administration did indeed try to influence what happened on the platform. And that Zuckerberg now regrets some of the calls his team made about COVID content during the election.\n\nPeople who pay attention to Silicon Valley and its internal fights over moderation on platforms like Facebook will know that Zuckerberg's comments are pretty mild. It's well established that various government bodies - including the Trump White House - were talking to all the platforms about COVID posts, among other things. And that there's been an industrywide pendulum swing against some of the platform-moderation efforts that built up over the years.\n\nStill, there is something to be said for having the guy running one of the biggest platforms to say that stuff to lawmakers out loud, on the record.\n\nWill that sway an undecided voter a few months before the 2024 election? I don't think so. But Republicans will try to make it so.\n\nThe letter becomes markedly less important after that. Zuckerberg's pledge not to fund voter-registration efforts doesn't seem very important since the pandemic has subsided. And while he acknowledges that those donations have been politicized by \"some people\" - which would include Jordan and other Republicans - he says his only regret about them is that they were politicized .\n\nBut the most telling thing about Zuckerberg's letter is the laptop anecdote.\n\nIf you're a normal person, the \"Hunter Biden laptop story\" probably doesn't mean much to you. If you spend time with a particular strain of conservative, it means a lot: It's a laptop containing all kinds of embarrassing emails and documents created by Joe Biden's son, which was initially dismissed by many people as a 2020 election hoax (for context: The Wall Street Journal , which had a first crack at the story, ended up passing; when the Post ran the story, one of the authors had his byline removed from the piece).\n\nThe concern that the laptop story was some kind of hack or disinformation campaign was why Twitter (bear with me here) prevented users from sharing links to the New York Post's coverage of the story in October 2020 - a dramatic overreach the company subsequently apologized for .\n\nBut now, Zuckerberg says, Facebook has admitted that it, too, made it harder for its users to get to that story. Aha!\n\nExcept you don't need a congressional committee to uncover that one. Because Facebook told the world it was doing that , as it was doing that.\n\nHere's Facebook's rep Andy Stone, on October 14, 2020.\n\nWhile I will intentionally not link to the New York Post, I want be clear that this story is eligible to be fact checked by Facebook's third-party fact checking partners. In the meantime, we are reducing its distribution on our platform.\n\nWhat if you were busy back then - what with the pandemic, and the election and all - and missed it?\n\nNo problem. Facebook executives have talked about this multiple times. Like in 2022, when Zuckerberg went on one of the world's most popular podcasts and told Joe Rogan why it \"sucks\" that he got the laptop story wrong. \"When we take down something that we're not supposed to, that's the worst.\"\n\nAs maybe-well-intentioned-but-definitely-mistaken platform decisions go, making it hard to find the New York Post's coverage of the laptop story wasn't great. But it wasn't nearly as embarrassing as Twitter's call, which is why you don't hear many people obsessing about it today.\n\nBut \"not a lot of people knowing about something\" is not nearly the same as \"Mark Zuckerberg admitting something.\" The former statement is true. The second isn't, but is way more exciting.\n\nWhich again, seems like the point of the whole exercise: Zuckerberg has tried to give Jim Jordan and his party a win - while giving them very little at all.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "An intensifying Republican-led legal campaign alleging big advertisers colluded to defund conservative media is rankling the ad industry\n\nThe chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, has stepped up his probe into advertisers' brand-safety efforts in recent weeks, an escalation that industry insiders fear could have a chilling effect on the Global Alliance for Responsible Media trade group.\n\nSince last year, the House Judiciary Committee has been looking into whether members of GARM illegally colluded to demonetize conservative platforms and voices, alleging that such behavior is anticompetitive and could be a violation of the Sherman Act.\n\nThis month, Jordan sent letters to the CEOs of Coca-Cola and the renewable energy company Ørsted requesting documents related to their membership of GARM. In Coca-Cola's case, Jordan is also seeking documents related to discussions about advertising on \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" on Spotify, while Ørsted is being asked to produce its communications surrounding advertising on X, formerly Twitter, after Elon Musk's acquisition of the company.\n\nCoca-Cola and Ørsted didn't respond to requests for comment.\n\nFounded in 2019 by the World Federation of Advertisers trade group, GARM is a cross-industry initiative designed to prevent brands from supporting harmful content with their ad dollars. It has more than 100 members, including big-name advertisers; agency groups; platforms such as X, Meta, and YouTube; and various other trade associations and adtech companies.\n\nGARM and its members developed a \" brand-safety floor and suitability framework \" for the industry to adopt. The framework provides common definitions around harmful and sensitive content, such as misinformation, pornography, piracy, terrorism, and hate speech. It doesn't name any individual publishers or platforms.\n\nJordan and the House Judiciary Committee issued wide-ranging subpoenas to both GARM and the WFA last year as part of the probe. Last month, Rob Rakowitz, the head of GARM, was called to appear before the committee for a transcribed interview, multiple people familiar with the matter said.\n\nRakowitz declined a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nCEOs of companies in GARM's steering group - Diageo, GroupM, Mars, Procter & Gamble, and Unilever - were also sent letters by Jordan in March of this year. These companies either declined to comment or didn't respond to requests for comment for this article.\n\n\"Evidence the Committee has obtained suggests that GARM members, led by Steer Team members, are colluding to demonetize conservative platforms and voices,\" the letters read, according to the Judiciary Committee's website.\n\nThe companies were asked for all documents and communications referring to conservative news outlets, including Fox News, The Daily Wire, Breitbart, and those related to advertising on X and Joe Rogan's podcast. The CEOs were also told to preserve all existing and future records related to their companies' work with GARM.\n\nSeveral people close to GARM said they believed the allegations were without merit because individual marketers were free to choose where they advertised, and there was no law that compelled them to spend with any particular publisher. But they said they were concerned that the probe and additional evidence requests would escalate in a highly charged election year, which could handicap the initiative's work. These people asked to remain anonymous in this article in order to discuss sensitive matters while the committee's probe was ongoing, but their identities are known to BI.\n\n\"GARM's members and board members are senior advertisers,\" a marketing executive close to GARM said. \"They want to avoid any kind of public qualm that has any partisan signature like the plague.\"\n\n\"It definitely has a chilling effect,\" another veteran of the digital-advertising industry said.\n\nThese people said one concern was that a congressional hearing or a lawsuit could be imminent. As Ad Age reported last year, states can't sue under the federal Sherman Act, but the committee could hand over its findings to a Republican state attorney general or a private litigant - such as a conservative publisher looking to claim GARM's brand-safety framework caused it financial losses.\n\nThere is precedent for conservative publishers making similar legal claims. In a separate case, for example, the Republican-led state of Texas and the conservative media outlets The Daily Wire and The Federalist are suing the US Department of State, claiming it funded technology - the Global Disinformation Index and NewsGuard - that censored conservative news. This month, the judge on the case rejected a bid to dismiss the suit .\n\nLawsuits or potential hearings aside, responding to document requests stretching to several years of records is a time-consuming and costly distraction for any organization. GARM, which has retained counsel to address the matter, has just two full-time staff members.\n\nLast year, academic researchers studying disinformation said their efforts were being hamstrung by an escalating number of resource-draining legal requests led by Jordan and other Republicans.\n\n\"I do think there is some blinding-you-with-paperwork aspect to Jim Jordan's assault on GARM,\" said Lou Paskalis, a veteran of the ad industry who's the chief strategy officer of the media watchdog Ad Fontes Media.\n\n\"GARM was given over a year to comply with simple document requests and was in no way harassed by the Committee,\" a spokesperson for the Judiciary Committee said in a statement.\n\n\"The idea that seven massive corporations are being harassed for having to comply with new documents requests is laughable,\" the statement continued. \"These companies know the evidence collected shows that members of GARM have worked for years to spread their personal biases and censor conservative voices and journalists online. These companies are simply trying to get ahead of the incriminating evidence before it becomes public.\"\n\nWhile Jordan's letters and requests have been an inconvenience, three sources close to GARM said the organization had otherwise been operating business as usual. GARM is close to unveiling a global media-sustainability framework in the coming weeks, a major piece of work that aims to create standards for measuring and disclosing carbon emissions produced by media and advertising.\n\nAd Fontes Media's Paskalis likened Jordan's efforts to \"political grandstanding\" and said it wouldn't change the trajectory of GARM in the long run.\n\n\"Jim Jordan is really embarrassing himself here because this is how the industry has always operated with regard to building voluntary standards so we can transact,\" Paskalis said. \"There's nothing under the rug.\"\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Devin Nunes and Jim Jordan led the Republican attack against Democrats and impeachment witnesses on the first day of public hearings\n\nRepublicans attempted a wide variety of defenses of President Donald Trump and lines of questioning of the two witnesses during the first day of impeachment hearings on Wednesday.\n\nIn one line of defense, Republicans attempted to characterize extensive testimony from Bill Taylor , the top US diplomat in Ukraine, and George Kent , the deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, as inaccurate hearsay.\n\nSeveral Republicans argued that the witnesses were simply repeating theories they'd gathered about Trump's actions from other unreliable sources, rather than from the president himself. GOP Rep. Jim Jordan argued that because nearly $400 million in US security aid to Ukraine was eventually released in September, there's no way Trump could've used it as leverage to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political opponents.\n\n\"What you heard did not happen,\" Jordan told Taylor. \"It's not just could it have been wrong, the fact is it was wrong, because it did not happen.\"\n\nThe administration released the aid on September 11 - after the White House learned that a CIA whistleblower filed a complaint alleging the president was involved in a quid pro quo with Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reportedly planned to announce the investigations into Trump's political opponents in a CNN interview on September 13.\n\nIn recent weeks, the GOP has promoted dozens of different defenses of Trump's actions regarding Ukraine.\n\nSome lawmakers also brought up the whistleblower, who filed a complaint in August about a July 25 call between Trump and the president of Ukraine, where Trump discusses the Bidens and an unsubstantiated claim about Ukraine and the 2016 election and asks for \"a favor.\" The whistleblower complaint helped spur the impeachment inquiry. A summary transcript of the call was released by the White House in September.\n\nRepublican lawmakers argue the whistleblower should testify, despite his protected right and desire to remain anonymous.\n\n\"We will never get the chance to see the whistleblower raise his right hand and swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth,\" Jordan said. \"And more importantly, the American people will never get the chance.\"\n\nAttacks on Democrats were sprinkled generously throughout the Republicans' statements and questions on Wednesday. Rep. Devin Nunes, the highest-ranking Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, promoted Trump's unsubstantiated claim that the Ukrainian government colluded with Democrats to interfere in the 2016 presidential election to help Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"They accuse President Trump of malfeasance in Ukraine when they, themselves, are culpable,\" Nunes said during his opening statement. \"The Democrats cooperated in Ukrainian election meddling and they defend Hunter Biden's securing of a lavishly paid position with a corrupt Ukrainian company.\"\n\nSome attempted to humiliate Wednesday's witnesses, both of whom are long-serving, non-partisan career diplomats.\n\nNunes said Taylor and Kent had, \"wittingly or unwittingly,\" been \"cast in the low-rent Ukrainian sequel\" to the \"Russia hoax.\" And he argued that career diplomats were part of a \"politicized bureaucracy\" undermining the president that had \"lost the confidence of millions of Americans who believe that their vote should count for something.\"\n\nThe lawyer for the Republicans, Steve Castor , elicited chuckles from Taylor when he asked if the \"irregular channel\" established by the Trump's personal lawyer between the administration and Ukrainian officials wasn't as irregular as it could've been.\n\n\"This irregular channel of diplomacy - it's not as outlandish as it could be, is that correct?\" Castor asked .\n\nThe GOP's strategy seemed to be to confuse and distract with a myriad of different defenses. The goal for both sides during the public hearing phase of the impeachment inquiry is to sway the American public, the majority of which support holding the proceedings.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Zuckerberg says White House pressured Meta over COVID-19 - and he has regrets\n\nIt appears that there's still some tension between Mark Zuckerberg and government officials despite the Meta CEO's desire to remain neutral.\n\nIn a letter sent Monday to Republican Rep. Jim Jordan , who chairs the House Judiciary Committee and has been a vocal critic of Zuckerberg, the Meta CEO recalled a moment when he felt pressured by the White House.\n\nZuckerberg said the Biden administration repeatedly pressured Meta in 2021 to remove content related to COVID-19 and \"expressed a lot of frustration\" when the company did not agree.\n\n\"Ultimately, it was our decision whether or not to take content down, and we own our decisions, including COVID-19-related changes we made to our enforcement in the wake of this pressure,\" Zuckerberg wrote in the letter, which was obtained by Business Insider and first reported by The Wall Street Journal .\n\nHe added: \"I believe the government pressure was wrong, and I regret that we were not more outspoken about it.\"\n\nInternal Meta emails obtained by the Journal last year showed the company had removed content related to COVID-19 after pressure from the White House.\n\nStill, Zuckerberg maintained in the letter to Jordan that he wanted Meta to abstain from endorsing a presidential candidate.\n\n\"My goal is to be neutral and not play a role one way or another - or to even appear to be playing a role,\" he wrote.\n\nZuckerberg said that, unlike in the last presidential election, he did not plan to donate to support election infrastructure in 2024. In 2020, he and his wife donated $400 million to nonpartisan organizations helping run elections during the pandemic. Republicans branded them \"Zuckerbucks\" and claimed that they benefited Democrats in the election.\n\n\"They were designed to be non-partisan - spread across urban, rural, and suburban communities,\" he wrote in the letter. \"Still, despite the analyses I've seen showing otherwise, I know that some people believe this work benefited one party over the other.\"\n\nThough the donations have long been controversial, a study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in May found private donations, like Zuckerberg's, did not advantage Democrats.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn the letter, Zuckerberg also addressed Meta's content moderation, an issue Jordan and other Republicans have been highly critical of, with them accusing the social-media company of censoring conservative viewpoints .\n\nIn 2023, Jordan threatened to hold Zuckerberg in contempt of Congress for not providing documents related to an investigation into allegations that Meta censored conservative viewpoints.\n\nZuckerberg also acknowledged that in 2020, Meta suppressed a New York Post story about Hunter Biden's laptop while waiting for a fact-check, saying: \"In retrospect, we shouldn't have demoted the story.\"\n\nHe said the company changed its processes to prevent this from happening again, such as no longer demoting stories while waiting for a fact-check.\n\nMeta declined to comment for this story.\n\nJump to"

Here's why none of them hold up.\n\nThe Republican strategy throughout the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump was simple: Throw everything at the wall and hope something sticks.\n\nAt the center of the inquiry is a July 25 phone call between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, during which Trump repeatedly pressured Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son as well as a baseless conspiracy theory alleging Ukrainian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nA cascade of testimony from career, nonpartisan officials over the past several weeks revealed that the phone call was just one data point in a months-long pressure campaign that Trump and his loyalists carried out to force Ukraine to accede to his political demands.\n\nAll the while, Trump withheld nearly $400 million in vital military aid to Ukraine - which is in a war with Russia - and a White House meeting Zelensky desperately sought.\n\nNow, as the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives moves closer to passing two articles of impeachment charging Trump with abuse of power and obstruction, the GOP is homing in on three main defenses of the president.\n\nRep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, a conservative firebrand who is one of Trump's staunchest congressional allies, outlined them Wednesday during a House Judiciary Committee hearing debating the articles of impeachment.\n\nIn Jordan's view, \"the facts are on the president's side.\" He then went through what he said were the three reasons Trump's conduct was unimpeachable:\n\nJump to"

Jim Jordan reportedly feels he's being bullied by an alleged victim of sexual abuse at Ohio State University, according to a CNN report , as he continues to deny any knowledge of the alleged abuse.\n\nJordan, a powerful Republican congressman from Ohio who is a member of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus, was the assistant wrestling coach at the university from 1986 to 1994. Former wrestlers he coached are now accusing him of ignoring and failing to stop the team doctor, Dr. Richard Strauss, from molesting them and other students, NBC News first reported on Tuesday .\n\nStrauss died in 2005, but in April the university announced it was opening an investigation into accusations he abused members of the wrestling team.\n\nThree former wrestlers are claiming there's no way Jordan would have been unaware that Strauss was abusing members of the team. Strauss allegedly routinely showered with the students and touched them inappropriately during appointments.\n\nJordan has vehemently denied any knowledge of the alleged abuse.\n\n\" We knew of no abuse, never heard of abuse. If we had, we would have reported it,\" Jordan told reporters on Wednesday .\n\nMike DiSabato, one of the former wrestlers who's come forward with the accusations, has called Jordan a \"liar\" over his denials.\n\nDiSabato told NBC News, \"I considered Jim Jordan a friend. But at the end of the day, he is absolutely lying if he says he doesn't know what was going on.\"\n\nThe former wrestler claims that Jordan told him to \"please leave me out of it\" when he told the congressman he planned to go public with the accusations earlier this year.\n\nAccording to a source within Jordan's office, the congressman planned to contact police over repeated emails from DiSabato, which he reportedly said constitute \"bullying.\"\n\nIn an interview with CNN on Wednesday, DiSabato laughed at the notion he was bullying Jordan in any capacity.\n\n\"Jim Jordan is a world-caliber athlete who is very aggressive in his actions ... he's a bulldog, let's be honest,\" DiSabato said. \"So for him to say he was being bullied by Mike DiSabato is somewhat laughable.\"\n\nAnother accuser and former wrestler at Ohio State University, Dunyasha Yetts, told NBC News that he and other teammates told Jordan about Strauss multiple times.\n\n\"For God's sake, Strauss's locker was right next to Jordan's and Jordan even said he'd kill him if he tried anything with him,\" Yetts said.\n\nAs Jordan faces these accusations, some have pointed to the past legal troubles of the alleged victims and questioned their reliability .\n\nYetts, for example, spent time in prison for bilking investors out of nearly $2 million. But he's not hiding that fact as he moves foward with these allegations against Strauss and Jordan.\n\n\"I am not a perfect person, but ask any of the wrestlers and they will tell you everybody knew about Doc,\" Yetts said.\n\nSome have also questioned DiSabato's motives, given he reportedly filed a lawsuit against Ohio State University over a separate issue in the past.\n\nBut DiSabato said he and other former athletes at the university were motivated to come forward by the recent conviction of former Olympics gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar .\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Thursday offered his support to Jordan and said he believes the congressman didn't know about the alleged abuse.\n\n\"I don't believe them at all. I believe him. Jim Jordan is one of the most outstanding people I've met since I've been in Washington. I believe him 100 percent,\" Trump said while speaking to reporters on Air Force One.\n\nThis came as a fourth former Ohio State University wrestler, Shawn Dailey, came forward and said he'd been abused. Dailey also said Jordan knew what happened.\n\n\"I participated with [Jordan] and the other wrestlers in locker-room talk about Strauss. We all did,\" Dailey told NBC News. \"It was very common knowledge in the locker room that if you went to Dr. Strauss for anything, you would have to pull your pants down.\"\n\nDailey said it was \"hurtful\" Jordan is denying any knowledge of the alleged abuse. \"I was surprised to hear Jim say that he knew nothing about it,\" he added.\n\nIf you are a survivor of sexual assault, you can call the National Sexual Assault Hotline (1-800-656-4673) or visit its website to receive confidential support.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "See the viral exchange where a Republican tried calling out Trump's whistleblower during the blockbuster impeachment hearings and a Democrat had the perfect response\n\nWhen GOP Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio suggested at a public impeachment hearing on Wednesday that the author of an anonymous whistleblower complaint against President Donald Trump should testify before the committee, Democratic Rep. Peter Welch of Vermont had the perfect response ready to go.\n\nJordan, the ranking member of the House Oversight and Reform Committee, called for the whistleblower to come before the committee and further questioned their credibility.\n\n\"This anonymous so-called whistleblower, with no firsthand knowledge, who's biased against the president, who worked with Joe Biden, who is the reason we're all sitting here today, we'll never get a chance to question that individual,\" Jordan said.\n\n\"We'll not get to check out his credibility, his motivations, his bias,\" Jordan continued, adding, \"This is a sad day for this country.\"\n\n\"I say to my colleague, I'd be glad to have the person who started it all come in and testify - President Trump is welcome to take a seat right there,\" Welch shot back at Jordan, prompting a chorus of laughter throughout the committee room.\n\nIn early September, a whistleblower complaint lodged by a member of the intelligence community said that in a series of events culminating in a July 25 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump used \"the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.\"\n\nThe complaint detailed concerns that Trump, days after withholding a nearly $400 million military-aid package , used the call with Zelensky to pressure the Ukrainian government to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son Hunter.\n\nHunter Biden served on the board of Burisma Holdings, a Ukrainian oil-and-gas company , from 2014 to 2019. Trump and his allies have, without evidence, accused Biden of using his power as vice president to urge Ukraine to fire a prosecutor who was investigating Burisma in order to protect Hunter.\n\nThe whistleblower's complaint has been corroborated by the White House's summary notes of the July 25 call, White House officials themselves, and the sworn testimony of several career diplomatic and national-security officials .\n\nMultiple diplomats have now testified under oath, in both closed-door and public sessions, that the Trump administration explicitly conditioned lifting the military-aid hold on Zelensky publicly announcing investigations into Burisma and a discredited conspiracy theory that Ukraine meddled in the 2016 election to benefit Hillary Clinton.\n\nAt Wednesday's hearings, Bill Taylor, the acting US ambassador to Ukraine, and George Kent, a State Department official, added more damning details to the allegations .\n\nTaylor testified that the White House did, in fact, withhold the aid in exchange for investigations and that it was \"alarming\" because placing a hold on military aid puts \"lives at stake.\"\n\nJump to"

Eric Swalwell of California likened several outspoken GOP lawmakers - namely Rep. Matt Gaetz, Sen. Ted Cruz, and Rep. Jim Jordan - to professional wrestlers, saying they were simply putting on an act on social media and television.\n\nSpeaking with the anti-Trump group MeidasTouch in a podcast released Tuesday , Swalwell said many of his colleagues were \"better suited to work at the WWE\" and were trying to give viewers \"what they think the fans want.\"\n\nHe said he had worked with Gaetz before the rise of Trumpism in the US and observed that Gaetz would turn into a character and \"laugh at himself about how stupid he had to act to keep the act going.\"\n\n\"And that's what's so frustrating. And this may sound crazy, but if you ran into Matt Gaetz or Ted Cruz or Jim Jordan at the Santa Monica Pier, you would say: 'These are nice guys!

You're just doing what the fans want, so I should just be cool with it because he projects onto me what he does.\"\n\n\"He thinks that I'm just performing as well,\" he added. \"And that's what's most sickening, is that I don't even know what these guys believe.

      "text": "DOJ officials reject Republicans' demands for audio recordings of Biden's classified documents interview\n\nThe Department of Justice on Monday strongly rejected Republicans' demands for audio recordings of President Joe Biden's interview with the special counsel who investigated his mishandling of classified documents , going so far as to accuse GOP lawmakers of requesting the tapes for purely political reasons.\n\nSenior DOJ official Carlos Uriarte sent a letter to Republican committee chairmen Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio and Rep. James Comer of Kentucky this week rebuking the deadline that party leaders had set for the agency. Jordan and Comer subpoenaed the tapes after Hur released his report in February.\n\nIn the Monday letter, Uriarte pointed out that lawmakers already have access to the full transcripts from the interview, according to multiple media outlets.\n\n\"Asking for the audio tapes when you have the transcripts is very unusual,\" Matthew Schmidt, an assistant professor of political science and national security at the University of New Haven, told Business Insider.\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Hur questioned Biden in October about classified documents found in 2022 at his Deleware home and an office he used after leaving office. In his final report, Hur said their two-day discussion played a role in his decision not to charge Biden in the matter , even though he determined that Biden did willfully keep classified government records after leaving office in some instances.\n\nHur cited a lack of evidence to charge Biden criminally, but Republicans zeroed in on Hur's suggestion that an eventual post-presidency prosecution of Biden could render him a sympathetic defendant because of his age and seeming memory problems.\n\n\"The expectation was that Republicans would use the audio tapes to essentially show Biden was suffering from dementia or senility on the basis of his voice or on the basis of him dropping words,\" Schmidt said.\n\n\"This could essentially be raw material for campaign ads,\" he added.\n\nUriarte appeared to make a similar claim in the Monday letter, suggesting Republicans may not be interested in actually gathering evidence but instead requested the tapes \"to serve political purposes that should have no role in the treatment of law enforcement files,\" The Washington Post reported, citing the letter.\n\nUriarte said the department had met or exceeded its subpoena requests for the case and accused Republicans of escalating the matter as \"conflict for conflict's sake,\" according to CNN .\n\nSchmidt said it's unusual for Justice Department officials to make such blatant accusations against lawmakers. The letter's tone, he added, is further proof of the country's divided and partisan political makeup at the moment.\n\nBusiness Insider reported in March that the transcripts of Biden's conversation with Hur suggest critiques of the president's memory are overblown and actually showcase his sense of humor while under pressure.\n\nBiden's handling of classified documents is unlikely to be a major campaign pillar for Republicans and GOP frontrunner former President Donald Trump in the coming election, Schmidt predicted.\n\nBut Biden's age is another story.\n\n\"That's why Republicans think it's so important they get ahold of these tapes,\" Schmidt said. \"Because the transcripts withhold a lot of human-level information.\"\n\nRepublicans have threatened to hold Attorney General Merrick Garland in criminal contempt for failing to fully with their subpoena - yet another sign of America's increasingly fractured political system, Schmidt said.\n\n\"In general, I think that would be a bridge too far,\" he said. \"But it's an election year. It could make political sense to go that far.\"\n\nJump to"

Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, is the only candidate in the race for House speaker, but he's still struggling to win over enough support from rank-and-file Republicans to get elected in a formal floor vote.\n\nJordan, 59, threw his name into the ring after the House ousted Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., as speaker this month. Since House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., failed to garner sufficient backing, Jordan has been the remaining contender for speaker.\n\nFollow live updates on the House speaker race\n\nJordan has served in the House since 2007 and has held several leadership roles, including chairman of the House Freedom Caucus and ranking member on both the House Oversight and Judiciary committees. He is now chairman of the Judiciary Committee.\n\nDemocr a ts sa y that if Republicans choose Jordan as speaker, they plan to tie endangered GOP House members to him - and all his hard-line views.\n\nHere are five key things to know about Jordan:\n\nJordan has been a polarizing figure on Capitol Hill over the last several years, and he has come under scrutiny for his previous job as a wrestling coach. In 2018, former wrestlers he coached at Ohio State University accused him of h a ving fa il ed to stop the team's doctor from molesting them and other students. Jordan, who was the university's assistant wrestling coach from 1986 to 1994, has repeatedly said he knew nothing of the abuse until former students began speaking out.\n\nFour of the wrestlers who made the accusations said last week that he shouldn't be speaker of the House .\n\n\"Do you really want a guy in that job who chose not to stand up for his guys?\" said former OSU wrestler Mike Schyck, one of the hundreds of former athletes and students who say they were sexually abused by school doctor Richard Strauss and have sued the university. \"Is that the kind of character trait you want for a House speaker?\"\n\nJordan has been a longtime ally of Trump, who endorsed h im for speaker , and he was involved in Trump's efforts to try to overturn the 2020 presidential election. The now-defunct House Jan. 6 committee said in its final report that Jordan was among several lawmakers who had \"materially relevant communications with Donald Trump or others in the White House\" who also failed to comply with the panel's subpoenas.\n\n\"Representative Jordan was a significant player in President Trump's efforts. He participated in numerous post-election meetings in which senior White House officials, Rudolph Giuliani, and others, discussed strategies for challenging the election, chief among them claims that the election had been tainted by fraud,\" the committee report said.\n\nThe committee said that on Jan. 2, 2021, Jordan led a conference call in which he and other members of Congress discussed with Trump strategies to delay the joint session on Jan. 6 to certify the electoral votes solidifying Joe Biden's victory.\n\nAccording to the report, Jordan spoke to Trump by phone \"at least twice\" on Jan. 6, but it said he has provided inconsistent statements about the number of times they spoke that day and what they discussed.\n\nJordan was a co-founder of the hard-line Freedom Caucus , which formed in 2015, and he was its first chairman until 2017.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus developed a reputation for rebelling against traditional House Republican leadership and causing intraparty drama. A number of the group's members, for example, issued threats in 2015 to oust John Boehner as speaker of the House, especially because of his bipartisan deals to fund the government and prevent shutdowns. Ultimately, Boehner voluntarily resigned from the post and from Congress that September after months of pressure and opposition from far-right lawmakers.\n\nFor several years, the group largely pushed a campaign to repeal or defund Obamacare, and while Trump was president, its members advocated his positions and policy proposals in Congress.\n\nJordan served on the House committee that investigated the 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya, where four Americans were killed, including U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens.\n\nJordan was among several GOP members who grilled former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for 11 hours when she was running for president in 2015 about the attack and the State Department's role leading up to it.\n\nThe committee's final report detailed interagency and bureaucratic failures but did not blame Clinton for the Americans' deaths.\n\nAs the current chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Jordan has been his caucus' chief investigator of Biden and his family, running probes into both the president and his son Hunter Biden. His panel was also among the three congressional committees McCarthy tasked with opening an impeachment inquiry into the president.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee held its first hearing in the process in September , at which a panel of Republican-picked witnesses said that while there is no evidence the president committed a crime, more bank records are needed from him and his son to gather more information.\n\nRebecca Shabad is a politics reporter for NBC News based in Washington.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Jim Jordan , R-Ohio, has endorsed Bernie Moreno in his state's combative Republican Senate primary, signaling consolidation of support around former President Donald Trump's preferred candidate in one of the biggest races of 2024.\n\nJordan, a Trump loyalist and a leading figure on the political right in Ohio, announced his support for Moreno in a statement first shared with NBC News.\n\n\"Bernie is a true America First conservative, and will make us proud in the U.S. Senate,\" Jordan said. \"Our country needs common sense conservative fighters now more than ever. Bernie is a political outsider who has lived the American Dream. His perspective, his grit and his conservative values will serve Ohio well in the U.S. Senate.\"\n\nMoreno, a former Cleveland-area car dealer and blockchain entrepreneur, scored Trump ' s endorsement last month, a development that could afford him a distinct advantage in a field that also features Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose and state Sen. Matt Dolan. Trump won Ohio twice by 8 points, and his endorsement of J.D. Vance here two years ago lifted the political novice out of a bruising primary and catapulted him to an open Senate seat. Vance has also endorsed Moreno.\n\nThe winner of the March 19 primary will face Sen. Sherrod Brown, who is viewed as one of the most vulnerable Democrats seeking re-election this year.\n\n\"As the next U.S. senator from Ohio, I'm excited to work closely with Rep. Jordan to always defend our conservative values and, in his immortal words, do what we said we were going to do,\" Moreno said. \"The reason that so many strong conservatives like Congressman Jordan, Sen. Vance and President Trump are uniting behind our campaign is because they know that Ohioans are sick and tired of career politician insiders like Sherrod Brown and are ready to send a political outsider to the U.S. Senate to replace him.\"\n\nOhio is one of the top three pickup opportunities - along with Montana and West Virginia, two other states Trump won decisively - for Republicans as they aim to flip partisan control of the Senate in 2024. It also could be one of the most expensive races in the country.\n\nMoreno and Dolan, whose family owns the Cleveland Guardians, have substantial self-funding capabilities , and LaRose has built-in name recognition from two successful statewide campaigns. But party leaders and other insiders have coalesced in recent weeks around Moreno, a dynamic that has accelerated since Trump's endorsement.\n\nRep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, who had considered entering the Senate primary, endorsed Moreno last week. So did the Club for Growth , a conservative group that has been at odds with Trump and had been pushing Davidson's potential bid. Four county parties are also behind Moreno.\n\nLaRose, who has courted Trump and his supporters, had hoped the former president would stay neutral. Dolan has focused largely on policy, such as border security and the fentanyl crisis , and has expressed interest in moving on from the Trump era. All three candidates list dozens of local elected leaders and activists on their endorsement pages . But Moreno has also attracted support from across the GOP's ideological spectrum nationally, including Kari Lake, the election-denying Arizona Senate candidate, and Sens. Mike Lee of Utah, Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming and Marco Rubio of Florida.\n\n\"Moreno's ability to consolidate different wings of the GOP and get grassroots support has been incredibly impressive,\" said one veteran Republican strategist in Ohio who is not affiliated with any of the campaigns. \"It's over unless the Dolan family dumps $25 million, and even then it's tough to overcome the momentum.\"\n\nCash could be a major factor given the resources Moreno and Dolan have. LaRose is not independently wealthy, and even with a $250,000 personal loan to his campaign last year, he remains far behind in the money race. While Moreno and Dolan have had a heavy presence on Ohio airwaves, LaRose has yet to run TV ads. He is expected to rely heavily on a super PAC that recently received a boost from GOP megadonor Richard Uihlein, Cleveland.com reported .\n\nLaRose is prepared for the fight and is \"still the front-runner,\" said his spokesperson, Rick Gorka, alluding to earlier polls that showed the secretary of state in the lead. Gorka added that LaRose can count on goodwill from grassroots voters and activists who appreciate his central role in an ultimately unsuccessful effort last year to defeat a ballot initiative that enshrined abortion rights in the state constitution.\n\n\"I think that between the campaign and the PAC, which we obviously have no control over, there's going to be plenty of opportunity for voters to hear from Frank,\" Gorka said.\n\n\"It is a three-way race. I don't see that changing at all,\" added Gorka, who also mocked Moreno's brief candidacy in the 2022 Senate primary and the Major League Baseball franchise run by the Dolan family. \"I wish the Dolans would actually have spent some money this offseason to make the team better instead of this ego project for one of their sons.\"\n\nDolan's money has helped keep him on TV, including a 60-second statewide commercial that launched last week - part of a $2 million advertising buy - and features an Ohio father who lost his son to a fentanyl overdose.\n\nChris Maloney, a Dolan strategist, telegraphed potential attacks against the other candidates and called out LaRose for firing a spokesperson in the secretary of state's office last year over social media posts poking fun at Trump.\n\n\"Frank LaRose reinvented himself, even fired a loyal aide, all for an endorsement he didn't get,\" Maloney said. \"Bernie Moreno is an ideological shapeshifter who will say or do anything to get elected. He is unvetted, untested and gaffe-prone. The more voters learn about Bernie, the less they're going to like him.\"\n\nThere has been no public polling of the race since Trump announced his support. The first televised debate with the GOP candidates is scheduled for Jan. 22 in Cleveland.\n\nHenry J. Gomez is a senior national political reporter for NBC News\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

I'm not saying for sure, but we want the information.\"\n\nOn Friday, Jordan and Rep. Barry Loudermilk, R-Ga., sent a letter to Smith's office requesting that the staff \"preserve all existing and future records and materials related to the Office of Special Counsel's investigations and prosecutions of President Trump.\"\n\n\"With President Trump's decisive victory this week, we are concerned that the Office of Special Counsel may attempt to purge relevant records, communications, and documents responsive to our numerous requests for information,\" the letter added.\n\n\"We do want the facts, and that's why we sent the letter.

The problems we face are challenging, but they are not insurmountable. We can focus on the changes that improve the country and unite us in offering real solutions,\" Jordan wrote. \"But no matter what we do, we must do it together as a conference. I respectfully ask for your support for Speaker of the House of Representatives.\"\n\nFollow along for live updates.\n\nJordan said he made his decision after many of his GOP colleagues reached out urging him to run. A source familiar with Jordan's thinking said that he has repeatedly said choosing the next speaker \"will be a decision for the conference\" and that now the conference is asking.\n\nJordan \"highly respects Scalise and other candidates running,\" the source added.\n\nMinutes after his announcement, Jordan received a pair of quick endorsements. \"I support Jim Jordan for Speaker,\" conservative Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., wrote on X .\n\nGOP Rep. Jim Banks, who is running for the Senate in Indiana, said, \"We need a conservative fighter to stand up strong to the Biden White House and Democrat Senate, and I can't think of anyone better than Jim Jordan.\"\n\nJordan has been one of Donald Trump's top allies on Capitol Hill, having defended the former president as he faced two impeachment investigations in the House and now serving as one of the GOP's leaders in the impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden.\n\nIn recent months, Jordan, a former NCAA wrestling champ and coach, had become a team player and close ally of McCarthy, R-Calif., and his leadership team. It was McCarthy who pushed for Jordan to get the top GOP slot on the Oversight Committee and later the powerful Judiciary Committee.\n\nBut Jordan began his career in Washington as a conservative bomb thrower, serving in 2015 as the founding chairman of the far-right House Freedom Caucus, whose members forced then-Speaker John Boehner , a fellow Ohioan, into an early retirement.\n\nBecause of that reputation, some moderate members of the GOP conference could balk at a Jordan speakership. And because of the GOP's razor-thin majority, it would take just five Republicans to block Jordan in a formal speaker vote on the House floor, because Democrats are expected to unite behind Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.\n\nKyle Stewart is a field producer covering Congress for NBC News.\n\nScott Wong is a senior congressional reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"
